{{nihongo|'''Astaroth'''|<U+30A2><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30ED><U+30B9>|Asutarosu}} is a fictional character in the [[Soul (series)|''Soul'' series]] of video games. Created by [[Namco]]'s [[Project Soul]] division, he first appeared in the original ''[[Soulcalibur]]'' and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise related to the series. He is voiced in Japanese by [[Banj<U+014D> Ginga]] for ''Soulcalibur'' and [[Ry<U+016B>zabur<U+014D> <U+014C>tomo]] in later titles;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=18936&tab=credits |title=Soul Calibur Credits |publisher=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref> in English, Astaroth is voiced by Jay S. Gilbert in ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'' and [[Michael McConnohie]] for the remaining titles.

Introduced in ''Soulcalibur'', Astaroth is a [[golem]] created by a cult worshiping the Greek god of war [[Ares]] to locate a cursed sword named "Soul Edge". Though Astaroth has consistently pursued the sword, his character has changed as the series progresses, eventually transforming into a power hungering creature desiring to consume the sword. Regarded as an iconic character of the series, Astaroth has been noted as fitting a large character [[stereotype]] seen in fighting games, featuring strong attacks but slow speed. Astaroth has been described as having easy-to-master gameplay and being popular with fans of strong, hard-hitting characters in fighting games.

== Conception and creation==
[[Image:Astaroth (Soulcalibur character - concept artwork).jpg|thumb|upright|left|During development, care was taken to keep Astaroth's look unique]]

As a character introduced in ''Soulcalibur'', Astaroth's weapon, a giant axe, was decided upon before other aspects of the character were. His design revolved around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. Once established, his appearance and movement were fleshed out by the team's [[concept art]]ist Aya Takemura<ref name="opm">{{cite web|author=OPM staff |url=http://www.1up.com/features/game-sciii |title=Behind the Game: Soul Calibur III |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |authorlink=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine}}</ref> and rendered as a [[3D model]] by a design team that worked solely on the character.<ref>{{cite web |author=De Marco, Flynn |date=2007-09-20 |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/tgs07/soul-calibur-director-katsutoshi-sasaki-on-weapons-characters-and-storyline-302211.php|title=Tgs07: Soul Calibur Director Katsutoshi Sasaki on Weapons, Characters and Storyline |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2008-07-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080904212721/http://kotaku.com/gaming/tgs07/soul-calibur-director-katsutoshi-sasaki-on-weapons-characters-and-storyline-302211.php| archivedate= 4 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Astaroth was then animated mainly by Nobuko Nimura using [[motion capture]] and working directly with the team,<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010709093256/www.soulcalibur.com/bladeblz/interview1.html |url=http://www.soulcalibur.com/bladeblz/interview1.html |archivedate=2001-07-09 |title=Interview with Nimura-san |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> while other motion designers created the movements for his grapple attacks.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010709095607/www.soulcalibur.com/wingsfth/int3.html |url=http://www.soulcalibur.com/wingsfth/int3.html |title=Interview with Shibue-san |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |archivedate=2001-07-09 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010709093443/www.soulcalibur.com/bladeblz/interview2.html |archivedate=2001-07-09 |url=http://www.soulcalibur.com/bladeblz/interview2.html |title=Interview with Ishizu-san |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref> During this phase the team additionally worked with the ''Soulcalibur'' story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development.<ref>{{cite web |author=CVG staff |date=2005-10-10 |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=127163 |title=Soul Calibur III Interview |work=Computer and Video Games |accessdate=2008-09-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080918053431/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=127163| archivedate= 18 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> ''Soulcalibur IV'' lead programmer Masaaki Hoshino called Astaroth his favorite character, stating that because he is "so powerful there's always a chance to make a comeback".<ref>{{cite web |author=Mielke, James |date=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=2&cId=3162887&p= |title=Soul Calibur IV Preview |work=1UP.com |publisher=UGO Networks |accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>

During development, a golem devoid of facial features, armed with a sword and shield, and accompanied by a small girl was considered as a possible character, but scrapped.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soularchive.jp/tmr/soulcalibur/illust/02_misiyou/04_dark.htm |script-title=ja:<U+958B><U+767A><U+8005><U+516C><U+52DF><U+FF11> |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> Before finalizing his appearance several other designs were considered, ranging from a [[Frankenstein's monster]]-inspired character to a medieval [[berserker]].<ref name="berserk">{{cite web |url=http://www.soularchive.jp/tmr/soulcalibur/Astaroth/asta_cha.htm |title=Astaroth Character Designs for Soulcalibur |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref> Despite having a male voice and physical build, Astaroth was referred to as "it" in terms of gender for the character's ''Soulcalibur'' background information.<ref name="astybio1">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010616210918/www.soulcalibur.com/text/astar.html |archivedate=2001-06-16 |title=Soulcalibur Astaroth History |url=http://www.soulcalibur.com/text/astar.html |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref> However the background information in other character profiles instead refer to him as male,<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010426185735/www.soulcalibur.com/text/ivyrev.html |archivedate=2001-04-26 |url=http://www.soulcalibur.com/text/ivyrev.html |title=Soulcalibur Ivy History - Revelations |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref> and his background information in later titles followed suit.<ref name="astybio2">{{cite web |url=http://www.soularchive.jp/tmr/calibur2/gc/12astaroth/c12.htm |title=Soul Archive profile for Astaroth |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

===Design===
[[Image:Astaroth-sc4.jpg|thumb|Astaroth's appearance was completely redesigned for ''[[Soulcalibur IV]]'']]

Astaroth is shown to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned humanoid with solid white eyes. A black mask wraps around and covers the lower portion of his head, while a black open [[gorget]] covers the nape of his neck and spiked [[spaulders]] cover his shoulders. Black spiked braces and boots cover his hands to the elbows and feet to the knees respectively, and black [[garters]] wrap around the middle of each thigh. A large black belt surrounds his abdomen supporting a [[faulds (plate armour)|fauld]] and cloth loincloth.<ref group="n">The types of armor pieces that comprise Astaroth's original attire are taken from ''Soulcalibur IV''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s character creation mode, in which they exist as components of Astaroth's secondary outfit</ref> Two black straps of leather crisscross the vertical center of his chest from the gorget to the belt, in between which lies his exposed, protruding heart.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Soulcalibur| developer = Namco| publisher = Namco| date = 1998-07-30| version = Arcade| level = Astaroth 1P model}}</ref> During development of the design, a flame positioned over his head alongside flaming eyes were considered, but were cut from the finished product.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010623083601/www.soulcalibur.com/edgesl/12_char.jpg |title=Astaroth 1P Outfit Design Artwork |format=[[JPEG]] |url=http://www.soulcalibur.com/edgesl/12_char.jpg |language=Japanese |archivedate=2001-06-23 |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref> Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall,<ref name="astybio2" /> making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.<ref name="necprofile">{{cite web |url=http://www.soularchive.jp/tmr/calibur2/gc/17necrid/c17.htm |title=Soul Archive profile for Necrid |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

In subsequent titles of the series Astaroth's appearance changed, showing more signs of damage and armor loss in ''II'' and in ''III'' shifting to a dark maroon skintone.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Soulcalibur II| developer = Namco| publisher = Namco| date = 2003-03-27| version = Console| level = Astaroth 1P model}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game| title = Soulcalibur III|developer = Namco| publisher = Namco| date = 2005-10-25| version = Console| level = Astaroth 1P model}}</ref> By ''Soulcalibur IV'', Astaroth's appearance was completely changed, altered to resemble a "rugged rocky" golem.<ref name="QA2" /> Facial features were completely removed, replaced with a large-mawed fractured head design with a headscarf covering the area around his forehead, eyes, and the back of his head. The remaining areas of his body featured several cracks over his build with red veins glowing from within. Large stone spikes jutted from each shoulder, while a similar pair jutted from each knee. Broken metal armor pieces protected his arms, legs, and chest, while a fauld surrounded his waist.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Soulcalibur IV|developer = Namco Bandai| publisher = Namco Bandai| date = 2008-07-29| version = Console| level = Astaroth 1P model}}</ref> Fans reacted negatively to the character's modified appearance once unveiled, complaining it was "monster-ish".<ref name="QA2">{{cite book |last=Sakasi |first=Katsutoshi |year=2008 |title=Soulcalibur IV Artbook |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |page=19}}</ref>

In most ''Soulcalibur'' titles, Astaroth's secondary character models contrast heavily against his primary design. Amongst these have included designs with several bone or spike protrusions from Astaroth's body,<ref name="berserk"/> to designs inspired by [[punk subculture|punk]] fashion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soularchive.jp/tmr/calibur2/si/wa04.htm |title=<U+6C17><U+307E><U+3050><U+308C>Watcher<U+3010><U+7B2C>4<U+56DE><U+3011>|publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref> This trend was discontinued in ''Soulcalibur IV'', where his appearance from ''Soulcalibur'' was reused instead.<ref name="QA2"/>

== In video games ==
Introduced in ''Soulcalibur'', Astaroth is a golem created by a cult of [[Ares]] to retrieve the cursed sword known as Soul Edge.<ref name="astybio1"/> Upon finding the blade, Astaroth realizes that it is damaged and allies himself with its wielder [[Nightmare (Soulcalibur)|Nightmare]] to harvest living souls necessary to restore the blade, planning to steal the blade once completed. However, before he can complete this task, he is confronted by a survivor of his attacks, [[List of Soul characters#Maxi|Maxi]], and is slain.<ref name="astybio2" /> Revived by Ares in ''Soulcalibur II'', Astaroth continues after the sword. However, the cult that created him regards this as a betrayal, and places a curse on the golem to dominate him. Astaroth resists and counterattacks the cult, learning in the process his design is not original but instead modeled after a human being, [[List of Soul characters#Rock|Rock]].<ref>{{cite video game| title = Soulcalibur III| developer = Namco| publisher = Namco| date = 2005-10-25| version = Console| level = Astaroth profile}}</ref> To assert himself as unique, Astaroth finds and nearly kills Rock at the conclusion of ''Soulcalibur III'', breaking free of Ares' control and transforming in the aftermath. Now hungering for power, he is offered it in return for servitude to Nightmare during the events of ''Soulcalibur IV'', an offer he accepts with the secret goal of devouring Soul Edge itself.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Soulcalibur IV| developer = Namco Bandai| publisher = Namco Bandai| date = 2008-07-29| version = Console| level = Astaroth profile}}</ref> Destroyed instead by Maxi, Astaroth's heart is retrieved by the cult responsible for his creation, and a new series of golems all bearing the name "Astaroth" are created from research conducted upon it.

Outside of the main games in the ''Soulcalibur'' series, Astaroth also appears in a [[Dreamcast]] [[VMU]] mini-game called "Cannon Dare", in which the player must shoot him out of a cannon by guessing the correct fuse,<ref>{{cite web |author=Ike, Yukiyoshi Sato |date=1999-12-17 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-calibur-vmu-download-available/1100-2447374/ |title=Soul Calibur VMU Download Available |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2000-04-08}}</ref> and later as a playable character in Namco's ''[[Pac-Man Fever (video game)|Pac-Man Fever]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Davis, Ryan |date=2002-09-04 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pac-man-fever-review/1900-2879234/ |title=Pac-Man Fever Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> Astaroth also appears briefly in ''[[Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny]]''{{'}}s Gauntlet storyline, a [[side story]] set after the events of ''Soulcalibur IV'', tearing through a forest and challenging the protagonist and allies after they defeat a rampaging Maxi.<ref>{{cite video game| title = [[Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny]] | developer = [[Project Soul]]| publisher = [[Namco Bandai]] | date = 2009-09-13 | platform = [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]| level = Gauntlet}}</ref> In the [[prequel]] ''[[Soulcalibur Legends]]'' a similar [[prototype]] golem, '''Astaroth <U+03B1>''', is discovered by game protagonist [[List of Soul characters#Siegfried|Siegfried]].

=== Gameplay ===
Astaroth's gameplay was developed around the concept of a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the ''Soul'' series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him.<ref>{{cite journal |date=November 2003 |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=172 |title=Afterthoughts: Soul Calibur II |author=Staff |pages=46<U+2013>47}}</ref> Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in ''Soulcalibur'' such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010709095517/www.soulcalibur.com/edgesl/interview.html |archivedate=2001-07-09 |url=http://www.soulcalibur.com/edgesl/interview.html |title=Interview with Yotoriyama-san |publisher=[[Namco Bandai]] |accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref>

Though noted as having slow attacks, Astaroth has been described as being an easy-to-learn character capable of dealing high amounts of damage,<ref name="guide3"/> though his advantages and disadvantages have been described as part of the "big guy" role he has in the game's roster.<ref name="guide2">{{cite web |url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/Games/Soul_Calibur_II/PUGG/p-6.html |title=Astaroth Guide |publisher=PlayStation.com |accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080206211226/http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/Games/Soul_Calibur_II/PUGG/p-6.html |archivedate = February 6, 2008}}</ref> Several of his attacks cover a wide range, while several of his grapple attacks allow room to deal with various defensive measures by opponents. Other attacks such as "Poseidon Tide" allow Astaroth to control the opponent's distance from himself while simultaneously dealing damage, with the additional feature of offering defensive measures of their own.<ref name="guide3">{{cite web |url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16958/page_10.html |title=Soul Calibur 2 Guide: Astaroth |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-06-28 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070304041411/http://guides.ign.com/guides/16958/page_10.html | archivedate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

== Promotion and reception ==
In 2000, Epoch C-Works released a series of [[action figure]]s based on characters from the original ''Soulcalibur'', amongst them Astaroth.
