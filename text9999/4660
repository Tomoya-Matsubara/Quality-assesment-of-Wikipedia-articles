'''Robert II''' (early 1316 <U+2013> 19 April 1390) became King of Scots in 1371 as the first monarch of the [[House of Stewart]]. He was the son of [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter Stewart]], hereditary [[High Steward of Scotland]] and of [[Marjorie Bruce]], daughter of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]] and of his first wife [[Isabella of Mar]]. 

[[Edward Bruce]], Robert I's brother, was named heir ahead of Marjorie but he died without issue on 3 December 1318 in a battle near [[Dundalk]] in Ireland.  Marjory by this time had died in a riding accident probably in 1317.  Parliament decreed that her infant son, Robert Stewart, was to be heir presumptive but this lapsed on 5 March 1324 on the birth of a son, [[David II of Scotland|David]], to King Robert.  Robert Stewart inherited the title of [[High Steward of Scotland]] on his father's death on 9 April 1326, and a Parliament held in July 1326 confirmed the young Steward as heir should Prince David die without a successor. In 1329 the king died and the six year-old David succeeded to the throne with Sir [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray]] appointed Guardian of Scotland.

[[Edward Balliol]], son of King [[John Balliol]], assisted by the English and Scottish nobles disinherited by Robert I, invaded Scotland inflicting heavy defeats on the Bruce party on 11 August 1332 at [[Battle of Dupplin Moor|Dupplin Moor]] and then again at [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] on 10 July 1333. Robert fought at Halidon, where his uncle and former guardian, Sir James Stewart, was killed. Following this battle, Robert's lands in the west were given by Balliol to his supporter [[David III Strathbogie|David Strathbogie]], the titular [[Earl of Atholl]].  Robert took refuge in the fortress of [[Dumbarton Castle]] in the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] estuary to join his uncle, King David. In May 1334 David escaped to France leaving Robert and [[John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray|John Randolph]], Earl of Moray as joint Guardians of the kingdom. Robert succeeded in regaining his lands but following Randolph's capture by the English in July 1335, his possessions were once again targeted by the forces of Balliol and King [[Edward III of England|Edward of England]]. This may have persuaded Robert to submit to Balliol and the English king and may explain his removal as Guardian by September 1335. The Guardianship transferred to [[Sir Andrew Murray]] of Bothwell but following his death in 1338 Robert was re-appointed and retained the office until King David returned from France in June 1341. Robert accompanied David into battle at [[Battle of Neville's Cross|Neville's Cross]] on 17 October 1346 but he and [[Patrick V, Earl of March|Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March]] escaped or fled the field and David was taken prisoner.  In October 1357, the king was ransomed for 100,000 merks to be paid in installments over ten years.

Robert married [[Elizabeth Mure]] c.1348, legitimising his four sons and five daughters. His subsequent marriage to [[Euphemia de Ross]] in 1355 produced two sons and two surviving daughters and provided the basis of a future dispute regarding the line of succession.  Robert joined a rebellion against David in 1363, but submitted to him following a threat to his right of succession. In 1364 David presented a proposal to Parliament that would cancel the remaining ransom debt if it was agreed that a [[Plantagenet]] heir would inherit the Scottish throne should he die without issue.  This was rejected and Robert succeeded to the throne at the age of 55 following David's unexpected death in 1371. England still controlled large sectors in the [[Lothians]] and in the [[border country]] so King Robert allowed his southern earls to engage in actions in the English zones to regain their territories, halted trade with England and renewed treaties with France. By 1384 the Scots had re-taken most of the occupied lands, but following the commencement of Anglo-French peace talks, Robert was reluctant to commit Scotland to all-out war and obtained Scotland's inclusion in the peace treaty. Robert's peace strategy was a factor in the virtual coup in 1384 when he lost control of the country, first to his eldest son, [[Robert III of Scotland|John]], [[Earl of Carrick]], afterwards King Robert III, and then from 1388 to John's younger brother, [[Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany|Robert]], [[Earl of Fife]], afterwards the first [[Duke of Albany]]. Robert II died in [[Dundonald Castle]] in 1390 and was buried at [[Scone Abbey]].

The first war of independence began in the reign of King [[John Balliol]].<ref>Watson, ''Power of the Past'', p.&nbsp;29</ref>  His short reign was bedeviled by [[Edward of England|Edward I]]'s insistence on his overlordship of Scotland.

Walter the Steward had died earlier on 9 April 1327<ref>Weir, ''Britain's Royal Family'', p.&nbsp;214</ref> and the orphaned eleven-year-old Robert was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, Sir James Stewart of Durrisdeer<ref name="Boardman, ESK p.3"/> who along with [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph]], Earl of Moray, and William Lindsey, [[Archdeacon of St Andrews]] were appointed as joint Guardians of the kingdom.<ref name="Boardman ODNB">Boardman, ''Robert II'', ODNB</ref>  David's accession kindled the second independence war which threatened Robert's position as heir.<ref name="Boardman, ESK p.4">Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;4</ref> In 1332 [[Edward Balliol]], son of the deposed John Balliol, spearheaded an attack on the Bruce sovereignty with the tacit support of King [[Edward III of England]] and the explicit endorsement of 'the disinherited'.<ref>'The disinherited' - those nobles or their descendents who had fought for the English but had not entered into Robert I's peace and had their property confiscated and distributed to the Bruce supporters.</ref>  Edward Balliol's forces delivered heavy defeats on the Bruce supporters at [[Battle of Dupplin Moor|Dupplin Moor]] on 11 August 1332 and again at [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] on 19 July 1333, at which the 17-year-old Robert participated.<ref name="Boardman ODNB"/> Robert's estates were overrun by Balliol, who granted them to [[David III Strathbogie, titular Earl of Atholl|David Strathbogie, titular earl of Atholl]] but Robert evaded capture and gained protection at [[Dumbarton Castle]] where King David was also taking refuge.<ref name="Boardman, ESK p.4"/> Very few other strongholds remained in Scottish hands in the winter of 1333<U+2014>only the castles of [[Kildrummy Castle|Kildrummy]] (held by [[Christian Bruce]], elder sister of Robert I and wife of [[Sir Andrew Murray|Andrew Murray of Bothwell]]), [[Loch Leven Castle|Loch Leven]], [[Loch Doon]], and [[Urquhart Castle|Urquhart]] held out against Balliol forces.<ref>Grant & Stringer, ''Medieval Scotland'', p.&nbsp;227</ref>

John Randolph, released from English custody in a prisoner-exchange in 1341, visited David II in [[Normandy]] before returning to Scotland.

With the king now imprisoned in England and Randolph dead, the Guardianship once again fell to Robert.<ref>Sadler, ''Border Fury'', p.&nbsp;228</ref> In 1347 he took the important step of ensuring the [[legitimation]] of his four sons, [[Robert III of Scotland|John, Earl of Carrick]] (the future King Robert III), [[Walter Stewart, Lord of Fife |Walter, Lord of Fife]] (d. 1362), [[Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany|Robert]] (the future [[Duke of Albany]]) and [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander]], Lord of Badenoch (and future [[Earl of Buchan]]), and six daughters by petitioning [[Pope Clement VI]] to allow a [[canon law]] marriage to Elizabeth Mure.<ref>Brown & Tanner, ''History of Scottish Parliament'', footnote 34, p.&nbsp;85</ref>

Even though an English prisoner, David retained influence in Scotland and Robert had his Guardianship removed by parliament and given jointly to the earls of Mar and Ross and the lord of Douglas<U+2014>this did not last and Robert was once again appointed Guardian by the Parliament of February 1352.<ref>Brown & Tanner, ''History of Scottish Parliament'', pp.&nbsp;85<U+2013>6</ref> The paroled David II attended this parliament to present to Robert and the members of the [[Three Estates]] the terms for his release. These contained no ransom demand, but required the Scots to name the English prince [[John of Gaunt]] as heir presumptive. The Council rejected these terms, with Robert naturally opposed to the proposal threatening as it did his right of succession.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pp.&nbsp;9<U+2013>10</ref> The king had no option but to return to captivity in England. The English chronicler Henry Knighton recorded:<ref>Brown & Tanner, ''History of Scottish Parliament'', pp.&nbsp;86<U+2013>7</ref> <blockquote><div style= "font-size:90%;"><span style="color:#eee;"></span> ... the Scots refused to have their King unless he entirely renounced the influence of the English, and similarly refused to submit themselves to them. And they warned him that they would neither ransom him nor allow him to be ransomed unless he pardoned them for all their acts and injuries that they had done, and all the offences that they had committed during the time of captivity, and he should give them security for that, or otherwise they threatened to choose another king to rule them. </div></blockquote> By 1354 ongoing negotiations for the king's release reached the stage where a proposal of a straight ransom payment of 90,000 merks to be repaid over nine years, guaranteed by the provision of 20 high-ranking hostages, was agreed<U+2014>this understanding was destroyed by Robert when he bound the Scots to a French action against the English in 1355.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;10</ref> The capture of Berwick together with the presence of the French on English soil jolted Edward III into moving against the Scots<U+2014>in January 1356 Edward led his forces into the south-east of Scotland and burned [[Edinburgh]] and [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] and much of the [[Lothians]] in a campaign that became known as the 'Burnt Candlemas'.<ref>Brown, ''The Wars of Scotland'', p.&nbsp;253</ref> After Edward's victory over France in September, the Scots resumed negotiations for David's release ending in October 1357 with the [[Treaty of Berwick (1357)|Treaty of Berwick]]. Its terms were that in turn for David's freedom, a ransom of 100,000 merks would be paid in annual installments over ten years<U+2014>only the first two payments were completed initially and nothing further until 1366.<ref>Rogers, ''The Wars of Edward III'', pp.&nbsp;218<U+2013>9</ref> This failure to honour the terms of the Berwick treaty allowed Edward to continue to press for a [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] successor to David<U+2014>terms that were totally rejected by the Scottish Council and probably by Robert himself.<ref>Rogers, ''The Wars of Edward III'', p.&nbsp;219</ref> This may have been the cause of a brief rebellion in 1363 by Robert and the earls of Douglas and March.<ref>Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'', p.&nbsp;130</ref> Later French inducements couldn't bring David to their aid and the country remained at peace with England until he unexpectedly died on 21 February 1371.<ref>Rogers, ''The Wars of Edward III'', p.&nbsp;220</ref>

===Consolidation of Stewart power and personal rule===
[[File:Robert II (Alba) i.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Robert II depicted on his great seal]]
David was buried at [[Holyrood Abbey]] almost immediately but an armed protest by William, [[Earl of Douglas]] delayed Robert II's coronation until 26 March 1371.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;40</ref> The reasons for the incident remain unclear but may have involved a dispute regarding Robert's right of succession<ref>Brown & Tanner, ''History of Scottish Parliament'' pp.&nbsp;102<U+2013>105</ref> or may have been directed against George Dunbar, Earl of March and the southern [[Justiciar#Scotland|Justiciar]], Robert Erskine.<ref>Grant in Jones, et al.,''New Cambridge History'', p.&nbsp;360</ref> It was resolved by Robert giving his daughter Isabella in marriage to Douglas's son, James and with Douglas replacing Erskine as Justiciar south of the Forth.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;45</ref> Robert's accession did affect some others who held offices from David II.  In particular, George Dunbar's brother John Dunbar, the Lord of Fife who lost his claim on Fife and Sir Robert Erskine's son, Sir Thomas Erskine who lost control of [[Edinburgh Castle]]. <ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pp.&nbsp;39, 53</ref>

The Stewart lands in the west and in Atholl grew in size: the earldoms of Fife and Menteith went to Robert II's second surviving son Robert, the earldoms of Buchan and Ross (along with the lordship of Badenoch) to his fourth son Alexander and the earldoms of Strathearn and Caithness to the eldest son of his second marriage, David.<ref name="Oram, p126">Oram, et al., ''Kings & Queens'', p.&nbsp;126</ref> Importantly, King Robert's sons-in-law were [[John of Islay, Lord of the Isles|John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles]], John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and [[James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas|James]] who would become the 2nd [[Earl of Douglas]].<ref name="Oram, p126"/> Robert's own sons, [[Robert III of Scotland|John]], Earl of Carrick, the king's heir, and [[Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany|Robert]], Earl of Fife, served as the keepers of the castles of [[Edinburgh Castle|Edinburgh]] and [[Stirling Castle|Stirling]] respectively, while [[Alexander Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan|Alexander]], Lord of Badenoch and Ross and afterwards [[Earl of Buchan]], became the king's Justiciar and lieutenant in the north of the Kingdom.<ref name="Boardman ODNB"/> This build-up of the Stewart family power did not appear to cause resentment among the senior magnates<U+2014>the king generally did not threaten their territories or local rule and where titles were transferred to his sons the individuals affected were usually very well rewarded.<ref name="Boardman ODNB"/> This style of kingship was very different from his predecessor's<U+2014>David tried to dominate his nobles whereas Robert's strategy was to delegate authority to his powerful sons and earls and this generally worked for the first decade of his reign.<ref name="Oram, p126"/> Robert II was to have influence over eight of the fifteen earldoms either through his sons directly or by strategic marriages of his daughters to powerful lords.<ref name="Oram, p126"/>

In 1373 Robert ensured the future security of the Stewart dynasty by having Parliament pass entailments regarding the succession.  At this time, none of his sons had heirs so it became necessary for a system to be devised to define precisely the circumstances in which each of his sons could inherit the crown&mdash;none of this would take precedence over normal succession by [[Primogeniture]].<ref>Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'', pp.&nbsp;141<U+2013>2</ref> <ref>The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M.

[ http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1373/3]  Date accessed: 21 May 2012</ref>  By 1375, the king had commissioned [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]] to write the poem, ''[[The Brus]]'', a history intended to bolster the public image of the Stewarts as the genuine heirs of Robert I. It described the patriotic acts of both [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James, the Black Douglas]] and Walter the Steward, the king's father, in their support of Bruce.<ref name="Oram, p126"/> Robert II's rule during the 1370s saw the country's finances stabilised and greatly improved due in part to the flourishing wool trade, reduced calls on the public purse and by the halting of his predecessor's ransom money on the death of Edward III of England.<ref name="Boardman ODNB"/> Robert II<U+2014>unlike David II whose kingship was predominantly Lothian and therefore lowland based<U+2014>did not restrict his attention to one sector of his kingdom but frequently visited the more remote areas of the north and west of the kingdom among his Gaelic lords.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pp.&nbsp;94<U+2013>5</ref>

Robert II ruled over a country that continued to have English enclaves within its borders and Scots who gave their allegiance to the king of England<U+2014>the important castles of Berwick, Jedburgh, Lochmaben and Roxburgh had English garrisons and controlled southern Berwickshire, Teviotdale and large areas in Annandale and Tweeddale.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;108</ref> In June 1371 Robert agreed to a defensive treaty with the French, and although there were no outright hostilities during 1372, the English garrisons were reinforced and placed under an increased state of vigilance.<ref>Sadler, ''Border Fury'', p.&nbsp;258</ref> Attacks on the English held zones, with the near certain backing of Robert, began in 1373 and accelerated in the years 1375<U+2013>7. This indicated that a central decision had probably been taken for the escalation of conflict rather than the previous small-scale marauding attacks by the border barons.<ref>Tuck & Goodman, ''War and Border Societies'', pp.&nbsp;38<U+2013>9</ref> In 1376 the [[Earl of March]] successfully recovered Annandale but then found himself constrained by the [[Bruges]] Anglo-French truce.<ref>Sadler, ''Border Fury'', p.&nbsp;260</ref>

[[File:Dunfermline Abbey Geograph.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Dunfermline Abbey which received Coldingham Priory as daughter house from King Robert]]
In his dealings with Edward III, Robert blamed his border magnates for the escalating attacks on the English zones but regardless of this the Scots retained the recaptured lands, which were often portioned out among minor lords, so securing their interest in preventing English re-possession.<ref>Sadler, ''Border Fury'', pp.&nbsp;259<U+2013>260</ref> Despite Robert's further condemnations of his border lords, all the signs were that Robert backed the growing successful Scottish militancy following Edward III's death in 1377.<ref name="Boardman ODNB"/> In a charter dated 25 July 1378 the king decreed that [[Coldingham Priory]] would no longer be a daughter house of the English [[Durham Priory]] but was to be attached to [[Dunfermline Abbey]].<ref>Tuck & Goodman, ''War and Border Societies'', p.&nbsp;40</ref> In early February the Scots&mdash;apparently unaware of the conclusion of an Anglo-French truce on 26 January 1384 that included the Scots in the cease-fire&mdash;conducted an all-out attack on the English zones winning back Lochmaben Castle and Teviotdale.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;118</ref> [[John of Gaunt]] led a reciprocal English attack that took him as far as Edinburgh where he was bought off by the burgesses but destroyed [[Haddington]].<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pp.&nbsp;118<U+2013>9</ref> Carrick and James, Earl of Douglas<U+2014>his father had died in April<U+2014><ref name="Tuck p. 42">Tuck & Goodman, ''War and Border Societies'', p.&nbsp;42</ref> wanted a retaliatory strike for the Gaunt raid.

Robert's sons, John, earl of Carrick, had become the foremost Stewart magnate south of the Forth just as Alexander, Earl of Buchan was in the north.<ref>Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'', p.&nbsp;141<U+2013>2</ref> Alexander's activities and methods of royal administration, enforced by Gaelic mercenaries, drew criticism from northern earls and bishops and from his half-brother [[David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn|David, Earl of Strathearn]]. These complaints damaged the king's standing within the Council leading to criticism of his ability to curb Buchan's activities. <ref>For an account of the background to Buchan's activities in the north of Scotland and the context in which he operated see Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pages 83<U+2013>9</ref> Robert's differences with the Carrick affinity regarding the conduct of the war and his continued failure or unwillingness to deal with Buchan in the north led to the political convulsion of November 1384 when the Council removed the king's authority to govern and appointed Carrick as lieutenant of the kingdom<U+2014>a coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat had taken place.<ref name="Oram, p126"/><ref>Grant in Jones, et al., ''New Cambridge History'', pp.&nbsp;360<U+2013>1</ref> With Robert sidelined, there was now no impediment in the way of war.

The victory of the Scots over the English at the [[Battle of Otterburn]] in [[Northumberland]] in August 1388 set in motion Carrick's fall from power. One of the Scottish casualties was Carrick's close ally James, Earl of Douglas. Douglas died without an heir, which led to various claims upon the title and estate<U+2014>Carrick backed Malcolm Drummond, the husband of Douglas's sister, while Fife sided with the successful appellant, [[Archibald the Grim|Sir Archibald Douglas]], lord of Galloway who possessed an entail on the Douglas estates.<ref name="Goodman p. 51">Goodman & Tuck, ''War and Border Societies'', p.&nbsp;51</ref> Fife, now with his powerful Douglas ally, and those who supported the king ensured a counter-coup at the December Council meeting when the guardianship of Scotland passed from Carrick to Fife.<ref name="Goodman p. 51"/><ref name="Grant in Jones, p361">Grant in Jones, et al., ''New Cambridge History'' p.&nbsp;361</ref> Many had also approved of Fife's intention to properly resolve the situation of lawlessness in the north and in particular the activities of his younger brother, Buchan.<ref name="Grant in Jones, p361"/> Fife relieved Buchan of his offices of lieutenant of the north and justiciar north of the Forth<U+2014>the latter role was given to Fife's son, [[Murdoch Stewart]]. Robert II toured the north-east of the kingdom in late January 1390 perhaps to reinforce the changed political scene in the north following Buchan's removal from authority.<ref name="BoardmanESK p171">Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;171</ref> In March, Robert returned to [[Dundonald Castle]] in Ayrshire where he died on 19 April and was buried at Scone on 25 April.<ref>The date of Robert II's death and the disputed date for Robert II's burial and the reasons for the delay in Robert III's coronation are explained by [[Dauvit Broun]] in Brown & Tanner, ''History of Scottish Parliament'' pp.&nbsp;112<U+2013>6</ref>

==Historiography==
The reign of Robert II has undergone a re-appraisal since the works of historians [[Gordon Donaldson]] (1967) and Ranald Nicholson (1974). Donaldson admits to a paucity of knowledge (at the time that he was writing) regarding Robert's reign and accepts that the early chroniclers writing near to his reign found little to criticise.<ref>Donaldson, ''Scottish Kings'', p.&nbsp;33</ref> Robert's career before and after he succeeded to the throne is described by Donaldson as "to say the least, undistinguished, and his reign did nothing to add lustre to it." <ref>Donaldson, ''Scottish Kings'', p.&nbsp;39</ref> Donaldson goes further and debates the legality of the canon law marriage of Robert and Elizabeth Mure following the papal dispensation but acknowledges that the acts of succession in 1371 and 1372 although sealing the matter in the eyes of Parliament did not end the generational feud of the descendants of Elizabeth Mure and of those of Euphemia Ross.<ref>Donaldson, ''Scottish Kings'', p.&nbsp;37</ref> Robert's earlier participation in combat at the battles of Halidon and Neville's Cross, according to Donaldson, had made him wary of sanctioning military expeditions against the English and that any such actions by his barons were concealed from him.<ref>Donaldson, ''Scottish Kings'', pp.&nbsp;39<U+2013>40</ref> Similarly, Nicholson described Robert's reign as deficient and that his lack of the skills of governance led to internal strife. Nicholson asserts that the Earl of Douglas was bought off following his armed demonstration just before Robert's coronation and associates this with the doubt surrounding the legitimacy of Robert's sons with Elizabeth Mure.<ref name="Pearson, Robert II">Pearson, ''Robert II''</ref>

In contrast, the historians Stephen Boardman (2007), Alexander Grant (1984 & 1992) and Michael Lynch (1992) give a more even-handed appraisal of Robert II's life.<ref name="Pearson, Robert II"/> Modern historians show a kingdom that had become wealthier and more stable particularly during the first decade of his rule.<ref name="Boardman ODNB"/> Boardman explains that Robert II was subjected to negative propaganda while he was High Steward<U+2014>David II's followers denigrated his conduct during his lieutenancies and described them as "tyranny"<U+2014>and again later as king when the supporters of his son John, Earl of Carrick said that Robert was a king lacking drive and accomplishments, weighed down by age and unfit to govern.<ref>Grant in Jones, et al.,''New Cambridge History'', p.&nbsp;359</ref><ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pp.&nbsp;123<U+2013>5 & 171<U+2013>2</ref> Robert II's association with Gaelic Scotland also drew criticism. He grew up in his ancestral lands in the west and was completely at ease with the Gaelic language and culture and possessed a potent relationship with the Gaelic lords in the [[Hebrides]], upper [[Perthshire]] and [[Argyll]]. Throughout his reign, Robert spent long periods in his Gaelic heartlands and complaints at the time in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scotland]] seem to have been influenced by the view that the king was too much involved in Gaelic concerns.<ref>Boardman in Broun & MacGregor, ''The Great Ill-Will of the Lowlander'', p.&nbsp;84</ref> Boardman also asserts that much of the negative views held of Robert II find their origins in the writings of the French chronicler [[Jean Froissart]] who recorded that '[the king] had red bleared eyes, of the colour of sandalwood, which clearly showed that he was no valiant man, but one who would remain at home than march to the field'.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', p.&nbsp;137</ref> Contrary to Froissart's view, the early Scottish chroniclers<U+2014>[[Andrew of Wyntoun]] and [[Walter Bower]] (who both utilised a source that was nearly contemporary with Robert II)&mdash;and later 15th and 16th century Scottish chroniclers and poets showed 'Robert II as a Scottish patriotic hero, a defender of the integrity of the Scottish kingdom, and as the direct heir to Robert I'.<ref>Boardman, ''Early Stewart Kings'', pp.&nbsp;108, 125 (footnote 2)</ref>

Grant (1992) acknowledges that Robert II's reign in terms of foreign and domestic policy was "not so unsuccessful".<ref name="Grant, Independence & Nationhood p.178">Grant, ''Independence and Nationhood'', P.&nbspc;178</ref> As far as William, Earl of Douglas's reaction was concerned when he staged an armed demonstration before Robert's coronation, Grant does not hold to the view that Douglas was in some way demonstrating against Robert's legitimate right to the throne but more an assertion that royal patronage should not continue as in the time of David II. Grant also advocates that the demonstration was aimed at father and son Robert and Thomas Erskine who held the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling and Dumbarton from Robert's predecessor.<ref name="Grant, Independence & Nationhood p.178"/> Grant seriously called into question the dependability of Froissart's writings as an effective source for Robert II's reign.<ref>Tuck & Goodman, ''War and Border Societies'', pp.&nbsp;30<U+2013>65</ref> Influential magnate coalitions headed by Carrick, having undermined the king's position, manipulated the Council of November 1384 to effectively oust Robert II from any real power.<ref>Oram et al., ''Kings and Queens'', pp.&nbsp;126<U+2013>7</ref> Grant gives little weight to the asserted senility of Robert and suggests that the deposition of Carrick in 1388 and then the resolution to join the Anglo-French truce of 1389 were both at the instigation of Robert II.<ref>Grant, ''Independence and Nationhood'', pp.&nbsp;180<U+2013>1</ref> Yet power was not handed back to Robert II but to Carrick's younger brother, Robert, earl of Fife which once again saw the king at the disposition of one of his sons.<ref>Oram et al., ''Kings and Queens'', p.&nbsp;128</ref> Despite this, the now unknown source whom both Wyntoun and Bower relied on made the point that Fife deferred to his father on affairs of state emphasising the difference in styles in the guardianships of his two sons.<ref>Brown & Tanner, ''History of Scottish Parliament'', pp.110<U+2013>2</ref>

Michael Lynch points out that Robert II's reign from 1371 until the lieutenancy of Carrick in 1384 had been one exemplified by continued prosperity and stability and which Abbot Bower described as a period of "tranquility, prosperity and peace".<ref>Lynch, ''Scotland: A new History'', p.&nbsp;138</ref> Lynch suggests that the troubles of the 1450s between [[James II of Scotland|James II]] and the Douglases which have been interpreted by some historians as the legacy of Robert II's policy of encouraging powerful lordships was in fact a continuation of David II's build up of local lords in the Marches and [[Galloway]]&mdash;Robert was satisfied with government to leave alone the Douglas and the Stewart earls in their fiefdoms.<ref>Lynch, ''Scotland: A new History'', pp.&nbsp;138<U+2013>9</ref> The weakening of government if anything, Lynch suggests, came not before the 1384 coup but after it despite the fact that the coup had at its root Robert II's favouring of his third son, [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] (known as the Wolf of Badenoch).<ref>Lynch, ''Scotland: A new History'', p.&nbsp;139</ref>

<!--==Fictional portrayals==
Robert II has been depicted in historical novels. They include:
* ''The Three Perils of Man; or, War, women, and witchcraft'' (1822) by [[James Hogg]]. The tale takes place in the reign of Robert II whose "country enjoyed happiness and peace, all save a part adjoining to the borders of [[Kingdom of England|England]]." Part of the action takes place at [[Linlithgow Palace]], where Robert promises to marry his daughter Margaret Stewart "to the knight who shall take that castle of [[Roxburgh Castle|Roxburgh]] out of the hands of the English". With Margaret adding her own terms, that "in case of his attempting and failing in the undertaking, he shall forfeit all his lands, castles, towns, and towers to me." In the absence of volunteers, Margaret vows to take the Castle herself, defeating Lord Musgrave and his mistress Jane Howard.<ref>Hogg,p. 4-10</ref>
* ''The Lords of Misrule'' (1976) by [[Nigel Tranter]]. Covers events from c. 1388 to 1390. Depicting the last years of Robert II and the rise of [[Robert III of Scotland]] to the throne. As the elderly king has grown "feeble, weary and half-blind", his sons, daughters and other nobles campaign for power. An ungoverned Scotland is ravaged by their conflicts. [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] and [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] are prominently featured.<ref>[http://cunninghamh.tripod.com/books/synopses90/misrule.htm "Lords of Misrule",synopsis from the bookjacket]</ref>
* ''Courting Favour'' (2000) by Nigel Tranter. Follows the career of [[John Dunbar, Earl of Moray]] in the courts of [[David II of Scotland]] and Robert II. John is a son-in-law to the latter and serves him as a diplomat.<ref>[http://CunninghamH.tripod.com/books/9105.htm "Tranter first edition books, publication timeline",part IV]</ref>
