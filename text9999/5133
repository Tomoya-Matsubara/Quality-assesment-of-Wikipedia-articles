'''Weightlessness'''  is a phenomenon experienced by people during [[free-fall]]. Although the term ''[[#Zero gravity|zero gravity]]'' is often used as a synonym, weightlessness in orbit is not the result of the force of gravity being eliminated or even significantly reduced (in fact, the [[acceleration]] towards [[Earth]] due to [[Gravitation|gravity]] at an altitude of 100 km is only 3% less than at the Earth<U+2019>s surface). Weightlessness typically occurs when an object or person is falling freely, in orbit, in deep space (far from a planet, star, or other massive body), in an airplane following a particular parabolic flight path (e.g., the <U+201C>[[Vomit Comet]]<U+201D>), or in one of several other more unusual situations.

== Introduction ==
Generally speaking, weightlessness occurs when a person (or object) is subject to (at most) a single, ''uniformly distributed'' force (typically gravity), or is not acted upon by any accelerating force. This is in contrast with typical human experiences in which a non-uniform force is acting, such as:

*standing on the ground, sitting in a chair on the ground, etc., in which case gravity is countered by the reaction force of the ground
*flying in a plane, in which gravity is countered by the [[Lift (force)|lift]] the wings provide (special [[trajectory|trajectories]] which form an exception are described below)
*during [[atmospheric reentry]] or during the use of a [[parachute]], when [[atmospheric drag]] decelerates the vehicle
*during an [[orbital maneuver]] in a [[spacecraft]], or during the launch phase, when [[rocket]] engines provide [[thrust]]

Gravity is a field force which acts uniformly on the mass of all people and objects in the frame of reference.  In cases where an object is ''not'' weightless, as in the above examples, a second force acts ''non-uniformly'' on the person or object in question. Aerodynamic lift, drag, and thrust are all non-uniform forces (they are applied at a point or surface, rather than acting on the entire mass of an object), and thus prevent the phenomenon of weightlessness. This non-uniform force may also be transmitted to an object at the point of contact with a second object, as in the contact between the surface of the Earth and one's feet, or between a parachute harness and one's body.

In the case of a spacecraft in orbit around the Earth, the force of gravity acts uniformly on the spacecraft and on its occupants; thus, occupants experience weightlessness. If a secondary force acts directly on the spacecraft (such as rocket thrust or atmospheric drag), it is transmitted through the structure of the vehicle to its occupants, and the occupants do not experience weightlessness.

== Terminology ==
{{Wiktionary}}
=== Apparent weight ===
While the technical definition of ''weight'' is the size of the [[force]] of [[gravity]] acting on an object, humans experience their own body weight as a result of what is called ''apparent weight'', or the [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Newton's third law|reaction force]] applied to a person by the surface on which the person is standing or sitting. In the absence of this reaction force, a person would be in free-fall, and would experience weightlessness. It is the transmission of this reaction force through the human body, and the resultant [[physical compression|compression]] and [[tension (physics)|tension]] of the body's [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], that results in the sensation of weight.

Because of the distribution of mass throughout a person's body, the magnitude of the reaction force varies between a person's feet and head. At any horizontal [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of a person's body (as with any [[column]]), the size of the compressive force being resisted by the tissues below the cross-section is equal to the weight of the portion of the body above the cross-section. (In the arms, the reaction force is equal to the weight of the portion of the arm ''below'' the cross-section, and is a ''tensile'', rather than a compressive, force, just as in a hanging rope.)

=== Zero gravity ===
{{Wiktionary|zero gravity}}
Often, the terms ''zero gravity'' or ''reduced gravity'' are used to mean weightlessness as it is experienced by orbiting spacecraft, but this is not technically accurate.  Spacecraft are held in orbit by the gravity of the planet which they are orbiting.  The sensation of weightlessness experienced by astronauts is not the result of there being zero gravitational acceleration, but of there being zero difference between the acceleration of the spacecraft and the acceleration of the astronaut. Space journalist [[James Oberg]] explains the phenomenon thusly:<ref>{{cite journal

{{quote|The myth that satellites remain in orbit because they have "escaped Earth's gravity" is perpetuated further (and falsely) by almost universal use of the zingy but physically nonsensical phrase "zero gravity" (and its techweenie cousin, "microgravity") to describe the free-falling conditions aboard orbiting space vehicles. Of course, this isn't true; gravity still exists in space. It keeps satellites from flying straight off into interstellar emptiness. What's missing is "weight", the resistance of gravitational attraction by an anchored structure or a counterforce. Satellites stay in space because of their tremendous horizontal speed, which allows them <U+2014> while being unavoidably pulled toward Earth by gravity <U+2014> to fall "over the horizon." The ground's curved withdrawal along the Earth's round surface offsets the satellites' fall toward the ground. Speed, not position or lack of gravity, keeps satellites up, and the failure to understand this fundamental concept means that many other things people "know" just ain't so.}}

=== Microgravity ===
{{Wiktionary|microgravity}}
[[Image:Candlespace.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Candle]] flame in orbital conditions.]]
The term ''[[Microgravity environment|microgravity]]'' is used to describe environments where the force of gravity is present but has  a negligible effect. Objects in orbit are not perfectly weightless due to several effects:

*In [[Low Earth orbit]], the force of gravity decreases by one [[Parts per million|part per million]] for every three meter increase in altitude.  Objects which have a non-zero size will be subjected to a [[tidal force]], or a differential pull, between the high and low ends of the object.
*In a spacecraft in orbit, the [[centrifugal force]] is greater on the side of the spacecraft furthest from the Earth.  This is also a tidal force.
*Objects within a spacecraft will slowly "fall" toward the densest part of the spacecraft.  When they eventually come to rest on the wall of the spacecraft, they will have weight.
*Though very thin, there is some air at the level of the [[Space Shuttle]]'s orbital altitude of 185 to 1,000 km. This atmosphere causes deceleration due to friction.  This has the effect of giving objects a small "weight" oriented in the direction of motion.  Above 10,000 km, this effect becomes negligible compared to the effect of the [[solar wind]].

The symbol for microgravity , ''<U+00B5>g'', was used on the insignia of [[Space Shuttle]] flight [[STS-107]], because this flight was devoted to microgravity research.

== Weightless and reduced weight environments ==
=== Reduced weight in aircraft ===
==== NASA's C-9 aircraft ====
[[NASA]]'s [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]] [[Vomit Comet|Reduced Gravity Aircraft]] is based at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] and affectionately called the "[[vomit comet]]". It is an airplane that NASA flies in 6 mile long [[parabolic]] arcs, first climbing in altitude, then falling, in such a way that the flight path and speed correspond to that of an object without propulsion and not experiencing air [[friction]]. This is realized by propulsion and steering such that air friction is compensated and nothing else. The result is that people inside are not pushed towards the bottom or any other side of the plane, i.e. they are temporarily weightless, each time for a period of 25 seconds. Typically one flight lasts about two hours, in which 40 parabolas are flown.

NASA's [[Microgravity University]] - Reduced Gravity Flight Opportunities Plan, also known as the Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program, allows teams of undergraduates to submit a microgravity experiment proposal. If selected, the teams design and implement their experiment, and students are invited to fly on NASA's [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]. The aircraft flies in the pattern described above, so that the experiment has around 20 to 25 seconds (each parabola) to perform its function in microgravity.

==== Zero Gravity Corporation ====
The [[Zero Gravity Corporation]] operates a modified [[Boeing 727]] which flies parabolic arcs similar to those of NASA's Reduced Gravity Aircraft. Flights may be purchased for both tourism and research purposes.

==== European Space Agency A300 Zero-G ====
The [[European Space Agency]] flies parabolic flights on a specially-modified [[Airbus A300]] aircraft, in order to research [[microgravity]]. The ESA flies ''campaigns'' of three flights on consecutive days, each flight flying about 30 parabolas, for a total of about 10 minutes of weightlessness per flight.  The ESA campaigns are currently operated from [[Bordeaux - M<U+00E9>rignac Airport]] in [[France]] by the company [[Novespace]],<ref name="novespace">[http://www.novespace.com Novespace: microgravity, airborne missions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> while the aircraft is operated by the [[Centre d'essais en Vol]] (CEV - French Test Flight Centre). The first ESA Zero-G flights were in 1984, using a NASA KC-135 aircraft in [[Houston]], Texas. [[As of 2006|As of March 2006]], the ESA has flown 43 campaigns.  Other aircraft it has used include the [[Russia]]n [[Ilyushin Il-76]] MDK and French [[Caravelle]].<ref name="esa.int main page">{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&level=11&page=paraf

==== Others ====
In Austria, a company called Paul's Parabelflug offers parabolic flights, but they are prohibited from offering zero-g flights, and now offer only Martian and lunar gravity flights.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

A company in Hungary briefly offered parabolic flights, but went out of business after only a few flights.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

A Swedish company, Xero, planned to fly parabolic flights with the mammoth [[Ilyushin Il-76]], but the person in charge of the project left the company, and the project was cancelled.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==== Reduced weight in pilot training ====
People have differing reactions to reduced weight sensations, and these reactions can compromise flight safety if an aircraft pilot is not trained to respond properly, particularly in an emergency. Normally in [[flight training]], [[flight instructor]]s will gradually introduce reduced weight maneuvers, while carefully monitoring the student pilot. Most students become accustomed to the sensation and are able to perform satisfactorily with some training. Students who are not able to overcome their anxiety are not able to complete flight training.<ref>[http://www.gliding.co.nz/Operations/Training/notes/acert/022%20Reduced%20G%20Famil.pdf Reduced G Familiarization]  from Gliding New Zealand.</ref>

=== Ground-based drop facilities ===
Ground-based facilities that produce weightless conditions for research purposes are typically referred to as [[drop tube]]s or drop towers.

==== NASA drop facilities ====
NASA's [http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/zero-g/ Zero Gravity Facility], located at the [[Glenn Research Center]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], is a 145-meter vertical shaft, largely below the ground, with an integral vacuum [[drop chamber]], in which an experiment vehicle can have a  free fall for a duration of 5.18 seconds, falling a distance of 132 meters. The experiment vehicle is stopped in approximately 4.5 meters of [[pellet]]s of expanded [[polystyrene]] and experiences a peak [[deceleration]] rate of 65g.

Also at NASA Glenn is the 2.2 Second Drop Tower, which has a drop distance of 24.1 meters. Experiments are dropped in a Drag Shield, in order to reduce the effects of air drag. The entire package is stopped in a 3.3 meter tall air bag, at a peak deceleration rate of approximately 20g. While the Zero Gravity Facility conducts one or two drops per day, the 2.2 Second Drop Tower can conduct up to twelve drops per day. 

NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] hosts another  [[drop tube facility]] that is 105 meters tall and provides a 4.6 second free fall under near-[[vacuum]] conditions.<ref>[http://science.nasa.gov/ssl/msad/dtf/tube.htm Marshall Space Flight Center Drop Tube Facility]</ref>

Humans cannot utilize these gravity shafts, as the deceleration experienced by the drop chamber would likely kill or seriously injure anyone using them; 20 ''g'' is about the highest deceleration that a fit and healthy human being can withstand momentarily without sustaining injury.

==== Other drop facilities worldwide ====
* [http://www.mglab.co.jp/index_e.html Micro-Gravity Laboratory of Japan (MGLAB)] - 4.5 s free fall
* Experimental [[drop tube]] of the metallurgy department of [[Grenoble]] - 3.1 s free fall
* [[Fallturm Bremen]] [[University of Bremen]] in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. - 4.74 s free fall

=== Neutral buoyancy ===
Weightlessness can also be simulated with the use of [[neutral buoyancy]], in which human subjects and equipment are placed in a water environment and weighted or buoyed until they hover in place.  NASA uses neutral buoyancy to prepare for [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) at its [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].  Neutral buoyancy is also used for EVA research at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[Space Systems Laboratory]], which operates the only neutral buoyancy tank at a college or university.

It is important to note that neutral buoyancy is not identical to weightlessness.  Gravity still acts on all objects in a neutral buoyancy tank; thus, astronaut in neutral buoyancy training still feel their full body weight ''within'' their spacesuits, though the suit and astronaut together are under no net force. Drag is also a significant factor when moving in a neutral buoyancy environment, whereas astronauts on EVA do not experience any drag.

=== Weightlessness in a spacecraft ===
[[Image:Weightless hair.jpg|thumb|Astronaut [[Marsha Ivins]] demonstrates the effect of weightlessness on long hair during [[STS-98]]]]
Long periods of weightlessness occur in a [[spacecraft]] outside a planet's atmosphere, provided no propulsion is applied and the ship is not rotating. Weightlessness does not occur when a spacecraft is firing its engines, even if the resultant acceleration is constant.  The thrust provided by the engines acts at the surface of the rocket nozzle rather than acting uniformly on the spacecraft, and is transmitted through the structure of the spacecraft via compressive and tensile forces to the objects or people inside.  

Weightlessness in an [[orbit|orbiting]] spacecraft or space station is physically identical to free-fall, the difference being that gravitational acceleration acts primarily on the direction, rather than the magnitude, of the spacecraft's [[velocity]].  In typical free-fall, the acceleration of gravity acts to linearly increase an object's [[speed]] (the magnitude of its velocity) as it falls toward the Earth.  In the case of an orbiting spacecraft, which has a large velocity component perpendicular to the force of gravity, the acceleration of gravity does not change the object's speed over the course of a complete orbit, but instead acts [[Centripetal force|centripetally]], to constantly "turn" the spacecraft's velocity as it moves around the Earth. In what are called "closed" orbits, the spacecraft ultimately returns to its starting point and repeats the orbit.  Without this change in the direction of velocity, spacecraft would move in a straight line, ultimately leaving the Earth altogether.

=== Weightlessness at the center of a planet ===
If a person were able to survive at the center of a planet, they would experience weightlessness without any acceleration.  This is because the force of gravity exerted by the surrounding planet would be the same in all directions, and would effectively cancel out, for a net force of zero.

More generally, the net gravitational force is zero ''everywhere'' within a [[Hollow Earth|hollow]], spherically symmetrical planet. This is known as the [[shell theorem]].

== Health effects of weightlessness ==
{{See|Space medicine}}
Following the advent of [[space station]]s that can be inhabited for long periods of time, exposure to weightlessness has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the Earth. In response to an extended period of weightlessness, various physiological systems begin to change and atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, long term health issues can result.

The most common problem experienced by humans in the initial hours of weightlessness is known as [[space adaptation syndrome]] or SAS, commonly referred to as space sickness. Symptoms of SAS include [[nausea]] and [[vomit]]ing, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[headache]]s, [[lethargy]], and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by [[cosmonaut]] [[Gherman Titov]] in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but in no case has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. [[NASA]] jokingly measures SAS using the "Garn scale", named for [[United States Senator]] [[Jake Garn]], whose SAS during [[STS-51-D]] was the worst on record. Accordingly, one "Garn" is equivalent to the most severe possible case of SAS.<ref>http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StevensonRE/RES_5-13-99.pdf, pg 35, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, interview with Dr. Robert Stevenson:<blockquote>"Jake Garn was sick, was pretty sick.  I don't know whether we should tell stories like that. But anyway, Jake Garn, he has made a mark in the Astronaut Corps because he represents the maximum level of space sickness that anyone can ever attain, and so the mark of being totally sick and totally incompetent is one Garn.  Most guys will get maybe to a tenth Garn, if that high.  And within the Astronaut Corps, he forever will be remembered by that."</blockquote></ref>

The most significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness are [[muscle atrophy]] and deterioration of the [[skeleton]], or [[spaceflight osteopenia]]. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise.   Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the [[cardiovascular system]], decreased production of [[red blood cell]]s, balance disorders, and a weakening of the [[immune system]]. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess [[flatulence]], and puffiness of the face.  These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.

Many of the conditions caused by exposure to weightlessness are similar to those resulting from aging.  Scientists believe that studies of the detrimental effects of weightlessness could have medical benefits, such as a possible treatment for [[osteoporosis]] and improved medical care for the bed-ridden and elderly.
