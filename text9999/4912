'''Dr. Jerry Punch''' (born August 20, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] [[auto racing]] and [[American football|college football]] commentator on [[ESPN]].  Punch also does local radio spots in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. He sometimes works as a sideline reporter for the [[Alabama Crimson Tide Football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] [[Football (American)|Football]] radio broadcasts.

==Early Life and Career==
Jerry began his broadcasting career in [[Newton, NC]], when he was selected to join the local High School Radio Staff of [[Newton-Conover High School]]. The local radio station, WNNC in Newton, NC, provided free air time to the local high school broadcasting organization with rotational assignments to the aspriing broadcast journalists. Students at the high school auditioned for the much sought after staff positions. Jerry was successful and was selected by fellow students to become a new reporter and, thus, he was permitted to participate in the weekly Saturday morning live broadcasts on WNNC.

He served as backup quarterback for coach [[Lou Holtz]] at [[North Carolina State University|NC State]] and graduated magna cum laude in 1975.  He received a [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree from the [[Wake Forest University School of Medicine]].

==ESPN Career==
Punch worked as an [[emergency room]] [[physician]] before moving to ESPN in 1984 as a pit reporter for [[NASCAR]] races.  In 1988, in two separate incidents, he helped with the rescue efforts after the serious wrecks of [[Rusty Wallace]] and Don Marmor. In the case of Rusty Wallace's front-stretch crash at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]], Punch happened to be on Pit Road at the time, and as a result, was the first person on the scene before the rescue crew could be scrambled. Punch's medical training proved pivotal, as Wallace was initially unconscious following this practice-session crash. Punch revived Wallace, who was able to start the following night's race with only minor injuries, driving for about half the race before giving his seat up to a relief driver. Wallace now works with Punch in the broadcast booth.

Punch is also credited with helping to save [[Ernie Irvan]] following a practice crash at [[Michigan International Speedway]] in August 1994. Punch also had aided injured pit crew members on pit road in several races in the 1990s. 

While Punch was addressing a [[Nashville Superspeedway]] media luncheon he was interrupted by a loud crash from the back of the room. Punch immediately rushed from the podium to the back of the room where Jenny Gill(daughter of singer/musician, [[Vince Gill]]), a Nashville Superspeedway intern, had fainted. Punch helped revive the [[Middle Tennessee State]] graduate student. She was taken to a local care center for observation and soon recovered, according to Sean Dozier, the superspeedway's public relations director. Punch returned to the podium and resumed his speech.

==Other Assignments for ESPN==
Punch also has been ESPN's expert for discussion of medical issues, has called play-by-play for college [[basketball]], and has served as a [[sideline reporter]] for college football. He also was consulted as a doctor in 1996 to report the condition of Nebraska quarterback [[Tommie Frazier]] who would go undrafted in the NFL due to a blood clot in his left leg.

On [[October 12]], [[2006]], he was named the lead lap-by-lap commentator for ESPN's coverage of the [[Sprint Cup Series]] and the [[Nationwide Series]] starting in 2007 along with [[Rusty Wallace]] (now [[Dale Jarrett]]) and [[Andy Petree]].

==Brief Movie Career==
Punch also appeared as himself as an ESPN commentator, in the 1990 film [[Days of Thunder]], which starred [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Nicole Kidman]].  Punch also acted as a technical advisor in the development of the movie.
