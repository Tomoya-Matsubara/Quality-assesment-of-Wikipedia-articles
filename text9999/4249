'''Hot chocolate''', also known as '''hot cocoa''', is a [[Temperature|heated]] [[Drink|beverage]] typically consisting of shaved [[chocolate]], melted chocolate or [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]], heated [[milk]] or water, and [[sugar]]. Some make a distinction between hot chocolate made with melted chocolate versus powdered, calling the former '''drinking chocolate'''. Drinking chocolate is also characterized by less sweetness and thicker consistency.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chocolate: history, culture, and heritage |last=Grivetti |first=Louis E. |coauthors=Howard-Yana Shapiro |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-470-12165-8 |page=345 }}</ref>

The first chocolate beverage is believed to have been created by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]s around 2,000 years ago, and a cocoa beverage was an essential part of [[Aztec]] culture by 1400 AD.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-493335/Chocolate-invented-3-100-years-ago-Aztecs--trying-make-beer.html|work=Daily Mail|title=Chocolate invented 3,100 years ago by the Aztecs - but they were trying to make beer|date=November 13, 2007}}</ref> The beverage became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the [[New World]], and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as stomach diseases. Today, hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations including the very thick ''cioccolata densa'' served in Italy, and the thinner hot cocoa that is typically consumed in the United States.

An early Classic (460-480 AD) period [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] tomb from the site of Rio Azul, Guatemala, had vessels with the [[Maya script|Maya glyph]] for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink.<ref name="Riches">{{Cite book|last=Burleigh|first=Robert|title=Chocolate: Riches from the Rainforest|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Ins., Publishers|year=2002|isbn=0-8109-5734-5}}</ref><ref name="M&M's">{{Cite book|last=Earley|first=Diane|title=The Official M&M's History of Chocolate|publisher=Charlesbridge Publishing|year=2001|isbn=1-57091-448-6}}</ref>

To make the chocolate drink, which was served cold, the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste and mixed it with [[water]], [[cornmeal]], [[chili pepper]]s, and other ingredients.<ref name="Riches" /> They then poured the drink back and forth from a cup to a pot until a thick foam developed. Chocolate was available to Maya of all social classes, although the wealthy drank chocolate from elaborately decorated vessels.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

What the Spaniards then called "chocolatl" was said to be a beverage consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold.<ref>Hickling, William (1838). ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''. ISBN 0-375-75803-8.</ref><ref name="Rediscover">{{cite web|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/Beverage/HotChocolate.htm|last=Stradley|first=Linda |title=Rediscover True Hot Chocolate - History of Hot Chocolate|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=What's Cooking America|publisher=Linda Stradley|year=2004}}</ref>

Because sugar was yet to come to the Americas,<ref name="Riches" /> ''xocolatl'' was said to be an [[acquired taste]]. The drink tasted spicy and bitter, unlike modern hot chocolate, which is typically sweet.<ref name="Riches" /> As to when ''xocolatl'' was first served hot, sources conflict on when and by whom.<ref name="Riches" /><ref name="Rediscover" /> However, [[Jose de Acosta]], a Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, described ''xocolatl'' as:

<blockquote>Loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it, having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant taste. Yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the Indians, where with they feast noble men who pass through their country. The Spaniards, both men and women, that are accustomed to the country, are very greedy of this Chocolate. They say they make diverse sorts of it, some hot, some cold, and some temperate, and put therein much of that "chili"; yea, they make paste thereof, the which they say is good for the stomach and against the [[catarrh]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.exploratorium.edu/exploring/exploring_chocolate/choc_3.html|title=The Sweet Lure of Chocolate|publisher=[[ThinkQuest]]|accessdate=2008-07-18|publisher=Exploratorium|first=Jim|last=Spadaccini|year=2008}}</ref> </blockquote>

After its introduction to Europe, the drink slowly gained popularity. The court of King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] soon adopted the drink, and what was then only known as "chocolate" became a [[fashion]]able drink popular with the Spanish [[upper class]]. Additionally, cocoa was given as a [[dowry]] when members of the Spanish Royal Family married other European aristocrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://btcocoa.com/index.php?page=articles-detail|title=History of Hot Chocolate|accessdate=2008-06-26|publisher=Pelangie Studio Design|year=2008}}</ref> At the time, chocolate was very expensive in Europe because the cocoa beans only grew in South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chocolate.org.uk/timeline/index.html|last=

Sweet-tasting hot chocolate was then invented, leading hot chocolate to become a luxury item among the European nobility by the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Even when the first Chocolate House (an establishment similar to a modern coffee shop)<ref name="Riches" /> opened in 1657, chocolate was still very expensive, costing 50 to 75 [[pence]] (approximately 10-15 shillings) a pound.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cadbury.co.uk/EN/CTB2003/about_chocolate/history_chocolate/chocolate_houses.htm |title=Chocolate Houses|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=Cadbury Trebor Bassett|year=2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071028025113/http://www.cadbury.co.uk/EN/CTB2003/about_chocolate/history_chocolate/chocolate_houses.htm |archivedate = October 28, 2007}}</ref>

In the late 17th century, [[Hans Sloane]], president of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], visited [[Jamaica]]. There, he tried chocolate and considered it "nauseous", but found it became more palatable when mixed with milk.<ref name="Sloane">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/projects/sloane-herbarium/hanssloane.htm|title=The Sloane Herbarium|year=2008|publisher=The Natural History Museum|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> When he returned to England, he brought the recipe with him, introducing milk chocolate to Europe.<ref name="Sloane"/>

In 1828, [[Coenraad Johannes van Houten]] developed the first cocoa powder producing machine in the Netherlands.<ref name="Riches" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middleboro.k12.ma.us/Middleboro/CHOC/Chocolate.htm|title=Chocolate History|accessdate=2008-06-26|publisher=Middleborough Public Schools|year=2008}}</ref> The press separated the greasy [[cocoa butter]] from cacao seeds, leaving a purer chocolate powder behind.<ref name="Riches" /> This powder, much like the instant cocoa powder used today, was easier to stir into milk and water. As a result, another very important discovery was made: solid chocolate. By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter, it was then possible to manufacture bar chocolate. The term "chocolate" then came to mean solid chocolate, rather than hot chocolate.

==Terminology==
[[File:White hot chocolate.JPG|thumb|upright|White hot chocolate]]
Americans use the terms "hot chocolate" and "hot cocoa" interchangeably. In other places, a distinction is made between "hot cocoa", made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans,<ref name="Term">{{cite web|url=http://www.statssheet.com/articles/article61849.html|title=Why Hot Cocoa Is Healthier Than Hot Chocolate|last=Craddock|first=Darren|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> and "hot chocolate", made directly from bar chocolate, which already contains cocoa, sugar, and [[cocoa butter]].<ref name="Term" /> Thus, the major difference between the two is the cocoa butter, the absence of which makes hot cocoa significantly lower in fat than hot chocolate while still preserving all the antioxidants found in chocolate.<ref name="daily">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/11/031106051159.htm|title=Hot Cocoa Tops Red Wine And Tea In Antioxidants; May Be Healthier Choice| publisher= Science Daily| date =

Hot chocolate can be made with [[Milk chocolate|dark]], [[Milk chocolate|semisweet]], or [[Hershey process|bittersweet]] chocolate chopped into small pieces and stirred into milk with the addition of sugar. American instant hot cocoa powder often includes [[powdered milk]] or other dairy ingredients so it can be made without using milk.<ref name="Nibble"/> In the United Kingdom, "hot chocolate" is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water, and powder containing chocolate, sugar, and powdered milk. "Cocoa" usually refers to a similar drink made with just hot milk and cocoa powder, then sweetened to taste with sugar.<ref name="Nibble">{{cite web| last = The Nibble| title = Some Like It Hot: Hot Chocolate & Hot Cocoa Mixes: An Overview | publisher = Lifestyle Direct, Inc.| date = 2005-2008| url = http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/beverages/cocoas/hot-chocolate-overview.asp| accessdate =2008-07-15 }}</ref>

==Usage==
Today, hot chocolate in the form of drinking chocolate or cocoa is considered a [[comfort food]] and is widely consumed in many parts of the world.

===North America===
[[File:Chocolate with churros.jpg|thumb|Traditional Spanish hot chocolate served with [[churro]]s.]]
In the United States, the drink is popular in instant form, made with hot water or milk from a packet containing mostly cocoa powder, [[sugar]], and dry milk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3883796/|title=Hot chocolate like you've never tasted before|last=Rosengarten|first=David|date=6 January 2004|publisher=TODAY|accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref> This is the thinner of the two main variations.<ref name="Thicker">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20061208/dd_chocolate08.art.htm|title=Warming up to real hot chocolate |last=Billet|first=Felisa|date=23 October 2009|publisher=USA TODAY|accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref> It is very sweet and may be topped with [[marshmallow]]s, [[whipped cream]], or a piece of solid chocolate.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Hot chocolate was first brought to North America as early as the 17th century by the Dutch, but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755.<ref name="Illustrated">{{Cite book|last=Morton|first=Marcia|coauthors=Frederic Morton|title=Chocolate, An Illustrated History|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|year=1986}}</ref> Traditionally, hot chocolate has been associated with cold weather, winter, and dessert in the United States. It is now rarely drunk with meals.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In Mexico, hot chocolate remains a popular national drink. Besides the instant powder form, traditional Mexican hot chocolate includes semi-sweet chocolate, [[cinnamon]], sugar, and [[vanilla]]. Hot chocolate of this type is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy [[froth]]. Mexican cinnamon hot chocolate is traditionally served alongside a variety of Mexican pastries known as ''[[List of Mexican dishes#Desserts and sweets|pan dulce]]'' or with [[churros]].

===South America===
In [[Peru]], hot chocolate is part of an ancient tradition. It is served with [[Panettone]] at breakfast on Christmas Day, even though summer has already started in the southern hemisphere. This tradition began in [[Cuzco Region|Cuzco]]; for this reason typical brands of chocolate bars are from this cocoa-producing region. Another region which produces best-quality cacao is the [[San Martin Region]] in the north [[Peruvian rainforest]].

In [[Colombia]], a hot chocolate beverage made with milk and water using a [[chocolatera]] and [[molinillo]] is enjoyed as part of breakfast with bread and soft, fresh farmers cheese. The chocolate bars used in the preparation come with granulated sugar mixed in, and sometimes have flavors such as cinnamon, cloves and vanilla added to the chocolate.

===Europe===

[[File:Wwa-wedel-czekolady-do-picia.jpg|thumb|Hot chocolate, Warsaw, Poland]]

In mainland Europe (particularly Spain and Italy), hot chocolate is sometimes served very thick due to the use of a thickening agent such as cornstarch. Among the multiple thick forms of hot chocolate served in Europe is the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] ''cioccolata densa''. German variations are also known for being very thick and heavy. Hot chocolate with [[churros]] is the traditional working-man's [[breakfast]] in Spain. This style of hot chocolate can be extremely thick, often having the consistency of warm chocolate [[pudding]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shafiqshafi.tripod.com/index.html|title=What is SPANISH CHOCOLATE?|accessdate=2008-06-26|publisher=The Spanish Chocolate Company|date=2000-2007}}</ref> In the Netherlands, hot chocolate is a very popular drink, known as ''chocolademelk'', it is often served at home or in cafes. In France, hot chocolate is often served at breakfast time; sometimes sliced bread spread with butter, jam, honey, or [[Nutella]] is dunked into the hot chocolate. There are also brands of hot chocolate specially formulated for breakfast time, notably [[Banania]].

Even further variations of hot chocolate exist. In some cafes in Belgium and other areas in Europe, one who orders a "''warme chocolade''" or "''chocolat chaud''" receives a cup of steaming white milk and a small bowl of bittersweet chocolate chips to dissolve in the milk.<ref name="Nibble" /> Particularly rich hot chocolate is often served in [[demitasse]] cups.

==Health==
{{Main|Health effects of chocolate}}
While hot chocolate is generally consumed for pleasure, there are several potential health benefits associated with drinking hot chocolate. A 2003 study from [[Cornell University]] found that cocoa contains large amounts of [[antioxidant]]s that may help prevent cancer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/03/11.20.03/cocoa_antioxidants.html|work=Cornell Chronicle|first=Blaine|last=Friedlander Jr.|title=

On the other hand, several negative effects can be attributed to drinking hot chocolate. Some hot chocolate recipes contain high amounts of [[sugar]].<ref name="Health">{{cite web|url=http://www.annamariavolpi.com/chocolate01.html|title=Can Chocolate Benefit Your Health? |last=Bonneville|first=Marguerite|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=Open Kitchen}}</ref>

===Benefits===
[[File:Hot chocolate antioxidants graph.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A graph showing the amounts of antioxidants contained in cocoa, [[red wine]], and [[green tea]].]]
Research has shown that the consumption of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by [[Cornell University]] has shown that hot chocolate contains more [[antioxidants]] than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease.<ref name="daily"/> In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of [[gallic acid]] equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of [[epicatechin]] equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea.<ref name="anti">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov03/HotCocoa-Lee.bpf.html|date=2003-12-03|last= Friedlander Jr.|first=Blaine P.|title=Ahhhh!

The [[flavonoid]]s found in the cocoa that makes up hot chocolate also have a positive effect on arterial health. A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a [[flavanol]]-rich cocoa beverage.<ref name="Times">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E0D8173DF934A25751C0A9629C8B63|title=Beyond Delicious, Chocolate May Help Pump Up Your Heart |last=Olson|first=Elizabeth|date=February 17, 2004|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of [[endothelial cells]] that line blood vessels.<ref name="Times" /> In further studies conducted by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls.<ref name="Times" /> Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from [[free radical]] damage.<ref name="Clinic">{{cite web|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/prevention/nutrition/chocolate.aspx|title=Your Heart and Vascular Health|date=1995-2008|publisher=The Cleveland Clinic |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood [[platelet]] buildup and can balance levels of compounds called [[eicosanoids]], which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.<ref name="Clinic" />

===Risks===
Several negative effects may be attributed to the drinking of hot chocolate. The types and severity of health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate.<ref name="cocoa vs choc">{{cite web|url=http://bestfriendscocoa.com/cocoa_vs_choc.html|title=Hot Cocoa vs. Hot Chocolate|accessdate=2008-06-29|last=Guttman| first=Linda| coauthors = Uri Guttman|publisher=Best Friends Cocoa|year=2008}}</ref> Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk.
