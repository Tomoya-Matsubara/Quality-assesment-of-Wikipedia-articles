'''Matthew Joseph West'''<ref name="mtv">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/lyrics/williams_joy/hide/13194541/lyrics.jhtml |title=Hide Lyrics | Joy Williams |publisher=[[MTV|MTV.com]] |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> (born [[April 25]], [[1977]]) is a [[Contemporary Christian music]]ian from [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. He has released four studio albums and is known for his number one hits "More" and "You Are Everything". He was nominated for five [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Award]]s in 2005, two of which were for his major label debut album ''[[Happy (Matthew West album)|Happy]]''.

First starting out as an [[independent music]]ian in the late 1990s, he released three independent albums before signing onto [[Universal South Records]]. With the release of his [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Award]]-winning debut album ''[[Happy (Matthew West album)|Happy]]'' (2003) came the success of his first radio single "More" which stayed at number one on Christian [[Adult Contemporary|AC]] charts for nine weeks and received two [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Award]] nominations. His second record ''[[History (Matthew West album)|History]]'' (2005) was followed by a 2006 re-release of the originally independent album ''Sellout''. In 2007 he faced vocal issues which threatened his career and two months of prescribed [[vocal rest]]. West's third studio album ''[[Something to Say (Matthew West album)|Something to Say]]'' (2008) was released in January of the following year and also enjoyed chart success with its number one hit "You Are Everything" in the March 2008.

In addition to his main solo career, West has worked as a songwriter for many Christian musicians and groups such as [[Point of Grace]], [[Mandisa]] and [[Natalie Grant]] as well as mainstream country acts [[Rascal Flatts]] and  [[Billy Ray Cyrus]].

==Early life==
Matthew West was born on [[April 25]], [[1977]] in the suburbs of [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref name="JFH-disc">{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/artists/MatthewWest.asp |title=Matthew West Discography |publisher=[[Jesus Freak Hideout]] |accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> As a child he was a fan of his hometown's [[baseball]] team, the [[Chicago Cubs]], and wanted to eventually play on their team and have a career in baseball.<ref name="2004 interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2004/matthewwest-0304.html |title=Staying in the Game |work=[[Christianity Today|Christian Music Today]] |date=2004-03-15 |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> He played baseball through high school, becoming his high school's baseball team captain as a senior. West was hoping for a college baseball scholarship but instead ended up receiving a four-year music scholarship at [[Millikin University]] in Illinois. He graduated from Millikin in 1999.<ref name="2004 interview" />

==Musical career==
West wrote most of his first songs in the sanctuary of his father's church while he was at home on college breaks.<ref name="2004 interview" /> He was a songwriter and [[independent music]]ian from 1997<U+2013>2002. During that time, he released three albums: ''September Sun'' (1997), ''Every Step of the Way'' (1998), and ''Sellout'' (2002).<ref name="emicmg">{{cite web |url=http://pressroom.emicmg.com/artists/MatthewWest/files/uploads/filedownloads/Matthew%20CutxCutfinal.pdf |title=Matthew West History.

Just before graduating from Millikin University in 1999, someone from the college recommended that West attend the [[Gospel Music Association|GMA]] [[Music in the Rockies]] event for aspiring musicians. Although West was not interested at first, he attended after learning that other people signed him up and paid his entrance fee.<ref name="2004 interview" /> West met a representative from Word Publishing at the event who took interest in him and kept in contact until he graduated. West landed in the finals of a songwriting competition there, and was then offered a songwriting deal in July of 1999, five weeks after graduating from college.<ref name="2004 interview" /><ref name="emicmg" /> After penning songs for well-known musicians like [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and [[Rachael Lampa]], he began touring the [[United States]] as an independent artist in 2000 and 2001.<ref name="emicmg" /><ref name="2004 interview" />

On [[July 26]], [[2002]],<ref name="emicmg" /> only a week or two before signing a record contract with [[Universal South Records]], West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and [[guitar]] playing. He says, "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked out in the middle of the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and then being taken to the [[hospital]]."<ref name="2004 interview" />

Upon reaching the hospital, West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major [[artery]].<ref name="2004 interview" /> He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first [[studio album]].<ref name="1cubed">{{cite web |url=http://1cubed.com/display.php?ID=171&sectionID=26 |title=Matthew West <U+2013> Biography, Interviews and Music Interviews |publisher=1cubed.com |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>
