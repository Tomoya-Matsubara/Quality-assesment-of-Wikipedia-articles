"'''Fear of Flying'''" is the eleventh episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]]. It was first broadcast on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on December 18, 1994. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is banned from [[Moe's Tavern]] and struggles to find a new bar. When he destroys a plane after being mistaken for a [[Aviator|pilot]] at a pilots-only bar, the airline buys the [[Simpsons family|Simpsons]]' silence with free tickets. The family discovers that [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] is afraid of flying.

The episode was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]], and written by [[David Sacks]]. It features numerous guest stars, including [[Anne Bancroft]] as Dr. Zweig. Additionally, [[Ted Danson]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Rhea Perlman]], [[John Ratzenberger]], and [[George Wendt]] appear as their characters from ''[[Cheers]]''. It received positive reception from television critics, and acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.6. The authors of ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' commented positively on the episode, as did reviews from DVD Verdict and DVD Movie Guide.

==Plot==
After pulling a prank on Moe, Homer is banned from [[Moe's Tavern]] and looks for another place to drink (including the [[Cheers|Cheers bar]]). He eventually settles for an airline pilots' bar, but is mistaken for a pilot and is put in the cockpit of an airplane, which he promptly damages. Fearing public humiliation, the airline gives the Simpson family free tickets to anywhere in the [[United States]] they desire (except [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]). However, the idea of plane travel fills Marge with anxiety as she has a [[fear of flying]], and after a panic attack on the plane, the trip is postponed.

Marge does not want to talk to anybody about her [[phobia]], and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] worries that Marge's decision to keep her feelings bottled up will cause them to "come out in other ways". When Marge begins to show signs of her lingering flight-related trauma by insisting the cat and the dog are living in sin, cooking giant feasts, and shingling the roof in the middle of the night, Lisa convinces Marge to undergo treatment with [[psychotherapy|therapist]] Dr. Zweig. Homer, however, grows increasingly paranoid about Marge's therapy.

Zweig uncovers the roots of Marge's fear, including the moment she realized her father was an apron-wearing [[flight attendant]], a job that was mostly reserved for women during that time, and not a pilot. Marge's shame is eased when Zweig assures her that male flight attendants are now very common and that her father could be considered a pioneer. Marge also brings up memories of her grandmother poking her in the eye as a baby while playing airplane, a toy plane catching fire, and having a plane fire at her, but the therapist just ignores this. Marge is cured of her fears, but when she and Homer attempt to fly on a plane again, the plane crashes into a lake.

"Fear of Flying" was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]], and written by [[David Sacks]].<ref name=Mirkin/> The story of the episode came about when Sacks came into the writers' room with an idea for an episode where Marge goes to a therapist "for one reason or another".

As Homer is looking for a place to drink, he even tries a lesbian bar, the She She Lounge. However, he soon realizes that "this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit". He then leaves, saying "Enjoy your deathtrap, ladies!". This is a reference to the famous [[Greenwich Village]] gay bar, the [[Stonewall Inn]]. This mafia-owned and -run bar "had no rear exit, so if there had been a fire on a weekend night, hundreds of customers would have had to escape through a single narrow passage leading to the front door."<ref name="book2">{{cite book|last=Eisenbach|first=David|title=Gay Power: An American Revolution |year=2006 |publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=0-7867-1633-9|page=85}}</ref>
