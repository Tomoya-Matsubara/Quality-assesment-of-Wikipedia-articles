'''Stephen Robert Pate''' (born [[May 26]], [[1961]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional golfer]] who has played on both the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[Nationwide Tour]].

Pate was born in [[Ventura, California]]. He attended [[UCLA]] and was a member of the [[golf]] team. He helped lead the team to the [[1983]] Pac-10 Championship, and earned All-American honors that year. He turned pro and joined the PGA Tour later that year.

Pate has won six [[PGA Tour]] events. His first victory was at the [[1987]] Southwest Golf Classic; and his most recent win was at the [[1998]] CVS Charity Classic. His best years in professional golf were [[1988]] when he won twice and finished 12th on the money list; and [[1991]], when he had five top-3 finishes including a win at the [[Honda Classic]], earned $727,997 and finished 6th on the money list. <ref> [http://www.pgatour.com/players/00/19/26 Bio from PGA Tour's official site]</ref> His best finish in a [[Men's major golf championships|major]] is a T-3 at both the 1988 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and the 1991 [[The Masters|Masters]].
