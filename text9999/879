'''John Francis O'Shea''' ([[Gaelige|Irish]]: ''Se<U+00E1>n <U+00D3> S<U+00E9>'') (born [[April 30]] [[1981]] in [[Waterford]], [[Ireland]]) is a professional [[Association football|football]]er who currently plays for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. 

==Career==
He signed his professional forms at 17 and had his professional debut in [[1999 in association football|1999]] against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park, England|Villa Park]]. Following loan spells at [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] and [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]] he returned to Manchester and began to feature in the United first team in the [[FA Premier League 2002-03|2002-03 season]], demonstrating versatility by playing at left-back, right-back, centre-back and central midfield during the successful [[FA Premier League 2002-03|2002-03 Premiership campaign]]. 

O'Shea earned his first senior [[cap (football)|cap]] for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on [[15 August]] [[2001]], when he came on as an 84th minute substitute at home to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. His debut ended in disappointment, however, when he gave away a penalty in injury time, which resulted in Ireland conceding their lead, and the game ending 2-2.

He displayed indifferent form in the [[FA Premier League 2004-05|2004-05 season]] and was linked with a move away from Manchester, with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] being linked with the Irishman. One of the highlights of Manchester United's otherwise slightly disappointing season was the 4-2 away victory against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], in which O'Shea scored the fourth goal by chipping Arsenal goalkeeper [[Manuel Almunia]] from the edge of the 18 yard box. 

An injury to [[Gary Neville]] in the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005-06 season]] also gave O'Shea more first-team opportunities. He was criticised for his lacklustre performances that season, and was reportedly one of the players lambasted by United veteran [[Roy Keane]] in a controversial interview on the club's [[Manchester United TV|MUTV]] channel.

On [[4 February]] [[2007]], during league game against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], O'Shea deputised for [[Edwin van der Sar]] in goal after the van der Sar was taken off the pitch for a broken nose, while Manchester United had already used all three substitutes. During this time he denied his Republic of Ireland teammate [[Robbie Keane]] a goal with a save a few minutes before full time. Following this incident, United fans chanted ''"Ireland's number one"'' in O'Shea's honour.

A month later he won over many United fans by scoring an injury time winner against Liverpool at [[Anfield]] for United in the league, having come on as a substitute for [[Wayne Rooney]]. This goal was important in United going on to regain the Premiership trophy for the [[Premier League 2006-07|2006-07 season]]. He also rescued his team against Everton in one of the final games of the season, when he bundled the ball in the net after Everton goalkeeper [[Iain Turner]] fumbled a [[Ryan Giggs]] corner. United went on to win 4-2. This was perhaps an even more decisive goal, as Bolton were drawing with Chelsea at the same time and defeat would have let Chelsea back into the title race. He scored another goal from close range, in a 2-1 defeat away to Portsmouth that season, this goal came during a injury hit part of the season, were O'Shea, as a versatile player, was required to play at full back.<ref>[http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=400832 O'Shea proud of keeper stint]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6578823.stm BBC Sport: Everton 2-4 Manchester United]</ref>

John O'Shea had a shooting accuracy of 100% and scored with 80% of his shots in the 2006-2007 season. He scored as many Premiership Goals as Chelsea's <U+00A3>30m record signing, former European Player of the Year, [[Andriy Shevchenko]]<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11667_2595247,00.html SkySports: United's midfield options]</ref>

During the [[Premier League 2007-08|2007-08 season]], Manchester United have used O'Shea as an emergency striker due to injury problems.  His use as a striker gives him the distinction of having played in every position for Manchester United.

On [[23 November]] [[2007]], John O'Shea extended his contract at Manchester United, to keep him at the club until [[2012]].

Throughout the 2007-2008 season John O'Shea came off the bench several times and proved important as a utility player on the way to a European double. O'Shea captained his club for the first time, during a 2-0 home defeat to Coventry City in the League Cup 4th round.

==Personal life==
O'Shea was born to Jim and Mary. After completing his schooling at [[De La Salle College Waterford|De La Salle College]] in Waterford, and developing his football skills at local clubs Ferrybank AFC and Bohemians, O'Shea travelled to [[Manchester]] and joined Manchester United after spending summers travelling to England to train with the academy.
