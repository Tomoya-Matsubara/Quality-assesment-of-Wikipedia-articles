'''Jon Coghill''' (Jonathan Robert Coghill, born 26 August 1971<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#1p6|title= What are the birthdays of the band members?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref>) is an Australian drummer best known for his work with Australian rock band, [[Powderfinger]], although he has also toured with [[Regurgitator]]. Coghill replaced Powderfinger's original drummer [[Steven Bishop]] in 1991 when Bishop wanted to pursue further studies. At this time, Powderfinger had not made any recordings, and as such, Coghill has been the group's drummer for all of their releases.

== Biography ==
{{seealso|Powderfinger}}
Coghill attended [[Nambour State High School]] in [[Nambour, Queensland]] where his father was a [[Physics]] teacher,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedaily.com.au/news/2007/dec/01/high-and-mighty-nambour/|title=High and mighty Nambour|publisher=The Daily|author=Carolyn Tucker|date=1 December 2007|accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> graduating in 1988. While in high school, Coghill's ambitions were not directed towards music, as he expressed an interest in [[Australian rules football|football]] or [[surfing]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|title=Then and now|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/extras/oq/book6coghill.html|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref> Upon graduating, he moved to Queensland's state capital [[Brisbane]] and began studying [[Botany]] at the [[University of Queensland]], however was interested in the Brisbane local music scene. Before long, Coghill had begun playing drums for local bands including side project Shock Fungus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#1p1 |title= Who is in powderfinger?|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>

Coghill met Powderfinger when he attended one of their practice sessions and joked with the band, introducing himself as a drummer. Two years later, when [[Steven Bishop]] left the band, [[guitarist]] [[Ian Haug]] recognised Coghill at an audition, and signed him at that point.<ref name=Others2 /><ref name=MusicianGuide>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002989/Powderfinger.html |title=Powderfinger Lyrics and Biography|publisher=Musician Guide|author=Christina Fuoco|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Previously, Coghill had been rejected in an audition for [[Custard (band)|Custard]].<ref name=PCHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/history.htm |title=Band History|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Jon spent about six months playing alongside Scott Coleman and Marc Zande in the Brisbane grunge band, Gland, before committing full time to Powderfinger in early 1992. In December 1997, Coghill took a brief break from Powderfinger and toured with [[Regurgitator]]. Drummer [[Ross McLennan (drummer)|Ross McLennan]] of [[Far Out Corporation]] and later from [[The Predators (band)|The Predators]], took Coghill's place for a Powderfinger performance on 19 December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/chron/chron97.htm|title=1997 - 19/12/97 - The Capitol, Brisbane.|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Concert Chronology|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>

Through his time in the band, Coghill has endeavoured to improve his drumming. In 1999 following the release of the band's third album ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'', he took up lessons with Brisbane-based drum tutor Col Gillies.<ref>{{cite web|work=Drum Scene|publisher=Powderfinger Central|author=Deegan, Ray|date=November 2001|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl35.htm|accessdate=2007-12-25 |title=Powderfinger - Jon Coghill}}</ref> Coghill has stated that he took the lessons due to being "really sore" "three quarters the way through a show".<ref name=eq />

In 2004, Coghill was named ''Best Drummer'' by [[Jack Daniel's|Jack Daniels]] for their inaugural [[Jack Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/648/The-Inaugural-Jack-Awards-Presentation.htm |title=The Inaugural Jack Awards Presentation|publisher=FasterLouder.com.au|author=demonika|accessdate=2007-12-30|date=9 June 2004}}</ref> To commemorate this, he joined with several other Australian musicians to form the one-shot band Superfinger Sleepychair. Composed of members of [[The Superjesus]], [[Silverchair]] and [[Sleepy Jackson]], along with Coghill from Powderfinger, the group's name is a [[portmanteau]] of all of the members' band's names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbmagazine.com.au/334/a-industry.shtml|title=Unibar gets the Jack|work=Industry|publisher=dBmagazine.com.au|date=2004|accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref>

Coghill has been described by Powderfinger [[lead singer]] [[Bernard Fanning]] as "psycho", stating "There's a constant battle between Cogsy and I as to who's the biggest psycho in the band" on numerous occasions.<ref name=BernQuotes2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/quotes2.htm#bern |title=Bernard says...|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Quotes|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Fanning has also said of Coghill "He likes to antagonise people, and I don't mean that in a mean way", and continued to say jokingly that "It makes me want to smash him sometimes."<ref name=BernQuotes2 /> [[Guitarist]] [[Darren Middleton]] says of Coghill "Jon likes movies with explosions in them",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/quotes2.htm#dz |title=Darren says...|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Quotes|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> and has also described him a stubborn.<ref name=Others2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/quotes2.htm#dz |title=On fame, fortune, and other things...|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Quotes|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Fellow guitarist [[Ian Haug]] says Coghill is an excellent arranger, explaining "he can listen to it all, just sort of sit back and go, 'Okay, that's a really good bit.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excellentonline.com/article.php3?story_id=502&section=Interviews |title=Powderfinger interview|publisher=Excellent Online|author=ajay|date=8 May 2001|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Coghill himself has described himself as a "superhero". He has also stated that he shares the band's hatred of [[photography|band photos]].<ref name=Others2 /> Coghill says he shares the stereotype of drummers being the most "out there" member of the band. He says this is true because "We have so much energy...We<U+2019>re stuck up the back and we<U+2019>re more likely to do stupid shit to get rid of it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/1269/Be-Fingerprinted-By-Powderfinger.htm|title=Be Fingerprinted by Powderfinger|publisher=FasterLouder.com.au|author=Elissa|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> In 2008, Coghill studied a mixture of politics and law at [[Griffith University]].

== Style, technique, and influences ==
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:left; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">One of the best things about being in the band is that we don't give a fuck about anything else other than having a good time, if people think we're rockstars then so be it, fucking great. Don't analyse things too much - it's not that serious, it's just fucking music.<p style="text-align: right;"><U+2014>Jon Coghill<ref name=Others2 />

Coghill took up drumming in high school, because "one of the coolest guy[s]" also played the drums. He says he never enjoyed reading about drumming, but preferred to talk to drummers. He has also stated that he doesn't listen to "drummer music", but prefers listening to music as a whole.<ref name=eq />

Coghill cites drummers [[Keith Moon]] and [[Mitch Mitchell]] as major influences on his playing, while boxer [[Mohammad Ali]] as a non-musical inspiration. He notes that multi-instrumentalist [[Stevie Wonder]] is his favourite.<ref name=eq>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmusician.com.au/mag/spring99/powderfinger.html |title=Powderfinger|publisher=''[[Australian Musician]]''|author=Eliezer, Christie|date=Spring 1999|accessdate=2007-12-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071113100347/http://www.australianmusician.com.au/mag/spring99/powderfinger.html |archivedate = November 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Others have noted that Coghill is influenced by [[The Dead Kennedys]] and [[The Fugees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/bios/bios.htm#Jon%20Coghill |title=Jon Coghill Biography|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> In 1997, Coghill stated "I<U+2019>m really interested in groove", and explained that he enjoyed the lyrical elements of [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] and bands such as [[Spearhead (band)|Spearhead]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl27.htm |title=Powderfinger - Break the Barrier|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 1997|author=Tracey Grimson|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Coghill has also stated that as a child growing up in [[Nambour]], he had aspired to be "a star like [[Michael Jackson]]". He says this ambition was sparked by a [[breakdancing]] teacher in his home town, and by his sister's love of Jackson's ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/quotes2.htm#cog |title=Cogsy says...|publisher=Powderfinger Central|work=Quotes|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>
