'''Elliott James Wilson''' (born [[3 November]], [[1976]]) is a former [[England|English]] [[cricket]]er who played [[county cricket]] for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. He was born in [[St Pancras]], [[London]].

In early July 1998, Wilson made his first-team debut for Worcestershire against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] in a [[the result in cricket|tied]] game in the [[National League (cricket)|AXA League]], scoring 15 and taking one catch. Later that month he scored 61 opening the batting in another [[one-day cricket|one-day]] match, against the touring [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lankans]], and two days later was selected to make his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]]. It was a chastening experience, however: he made only 25 and 3 as Worcestershire were crushed by an innings and 160 runs. Nevertheless, Wilson was retained in the side and was a first-team regular for the remainder of the season, although he made no significant scores.

1999 was a fairly successful season for Wilson: in nine first-class matches, he scored 536 runs [[batting average|at 35.73]], including a career-best 116 against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and three further half-centuries; while in [[List A cricket|List A]] games he scored two fifties, including a career-best 62 (albeit in a losing cause) against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]. In 2000, he was a regular selection for his county, playing 17 first-class games, but despite two further centuries he averaged under 27 overall, while in the one-day format he had a nightmare, averaging 12.64 from 16 innings with a high score of just 38.

Wilson spent the winter playing in [[Australia]], but was forced to return home with an spinal infection caused by an unclean needle during a routine injection. He spent a considerable amount of time in hospital and had several major operations as a result of the infection leading to a significant amount of time out of the game.

At the time there was optimism that he would recover and play for Worcestershire again, but in the event this did not happen.He attempted a comeback in 2003, when he played a handful of matches for [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club|Cambridgeshire]], including one List A game in the [[G&G Trophy]] against Yorkshire, however his back was not up to the rigours of everyday cricket
