'''''The Public Eye''''' is a 1992 [[neo-noir]] film written and directed by [[Howard Franklin]], produced by Sue Baden-Powell, and starring [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Barbara Hershey]]. [[Stanley Tucci]] and [[Richard Schiff]] appear in supporting roles.

The film is loosely based on ''[[New York Daily News]]'' [[photographer]] [[Weegee|Arthur "Weegee" Fellig]], and some of the photos in the film were taken by Fellig.

==Plot==
In the 1940s, Leon "Bernzy" Bernstein is a free-lance photographer for the [[New York City]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s, dedicated to his vivid and realistic work and his ability to get shots nobody else can get. He is very confident of his skills, declaring at one point, "Nobody does what I do. Nobody."

With a police [[radio]] under the dashboard of his car and a makeshift [[darkroom]] in his trunk, he quickly races to the scene of horrific crimes and accidents in order to snap exclusive photographs. He's so good at his job that he becomes known affectionately as the "Great Bernzini."

Bernzy meets the sultry widow Kay Levitz, who owns a nightclub. It seems the [[organized crime|mob]] is muscling in on her due to some arrangement with her late husband. Kay asks if Bernzy could investigate an individual she considers troublesome. Generally unsuccessful with women, Bernzy agrees to help. In fact, he begins falling in love with Kay.

After talking to his contacts, including [[journalism|journalist]] friend Arthur Nabler, he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him dead. But when he calls the police, he becomes a suspect. The police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] are also very interested in this case. Bernstein makes a connection with gangster Sal, uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war, [[rationing|gas rationing]] and the government. His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at a restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place.

==Production==
[[Image:Publiceyeimage.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Joe Pesci]] as "Bernzy".]]
Joe Pesci took this role right after his [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winning performance in ''[[Goodfellas (film)|Goodfellas]]''.  It was an attempt to capitalize on his popularity at the time and help elevate Pesci from respected character actor to star status.

Director and writer Howard Franklin was unable to secure the rights to Arthur "Weegee" Fellig's story.  Franklin, then, wrote the story of a Weegee-like photographer who smokes cigars and he named him Leon "Bernzy" Bernstein.  In the film, like Weegee, cops wonder if Bernzy uses a [[ouija board]] to snap his photographs and find the stories.<ref>Gallagher, Sean. ''Suite 101,'' film review.</ref>

According to journalist Doug Trapp, Franklin, was inspired to write the screenplay after seeing a show of Fellig's photos in the 1980s at the [[International Center of Photography]] in [[New York City]]. And Weegee did, in real life, have  a "soul-mate" named Wilma Wilcox, who was the woman in charge of the his estate.  But, Franklin has always denied that the film was about their relationship.<ref>[http://www.citybeat.com/2002-07-18/cover.shtml Trapp, Doug].

==Reception==
''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic, [[Roger Ebert]], was especially complimentary of the film and of actor Joe Pesci, and wrote, "One of the best things about the movie is the way it shows us how seriously Bernzy takes his work. He doesn't talk about it. He does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly [[Speed Graphic]] with the glass flashbulbs. In the movie's big scene of a mob assassination, he stares death in the face to get a great picture."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921014/REVIEWS/210140301/1023 Ebert, Roger]. The ''Chicago Sun-Times,'' film review, October 14, 1992.</ref> Ebert said the film made him "think" a little bit of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942).

''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine liked the acting and the script, and wrote, "The main virtue of screenwriter Franklin's debut as director is Pesci's portrayal of [[Weegee]], the famous low-life tabloid photographer of urban disaster, lightly concealed as Bernstein, 'The Great Bernzini'... good dialogue, nice period recreation, great performances."<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/71554.html ''Time Out Film Guide'']. ''Time Out-New York'', film review. Last accessed: November 29, 2007.</ref>

Desson Howe, film critic for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "''Public'' wants to be taken for an atmospheric film noir, full of intrigue, romance and street toughness. But it's all flash and no picture. Despite the usual quippy, perky performance from Pesci, as well as [[cinematographer]] [[Peter Suschitzky]]'s moodily delineated images, the movie is superficial and unengaging. It's as if [[Life magazine|''Life'']] magazine decided to make an oldtime gangster movie."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/thepubliceyerhowe_a0af21.htm Howe, Desson]. ''The Washington Post'', film review, October 16, 1992.</ref>

==Soundtrack==
The original score for the film was written and recorded by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] but he was replaced by [[Mark Isham]] at a late stage. As such, Isham had a lot of work to do and in a short time.  He found working with director Franklin a wonderful and educational experience.<ref>[http://www.scoremagacine.com/Entrevistas_eng_det.php?Codigo=17 ''Score Magazine''] interview with Mark Isham, by Miguel <U+00C1>ngel Ord<U+00F3><U+00F1>ez and Pablo Nieto, 2005.</ref>

A motion picture original soundtrack was released.  [[Shorty Rogers]] also worked on the score and contributed 1 track.  The [[CD]] contained nineteen tracks in total.  The CD was released on October 13, 1992 on the Varese Sarabande label.<ref>[[Amazon.com]] web site.</ref>  Mark Isham uses a dark melody played mostly on piano. Isham mixes [[symphonic]], [[jazz]] and [[electronic music]]; [[String instrument|strings]] and [[trumpet]] also play a major role.
