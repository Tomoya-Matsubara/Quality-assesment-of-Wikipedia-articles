The show is premised on (and plays with) the [[stereotype]] that gay men are superior in matters of [[fashion]], style, personal grooming, [[interior design]] and culture. In each episode, a team of five gay men<U+2014>known collectively as the "Fab Five"<U+2014>perform a [[makeover]] (in the parlance of the show, a "make-better"<ref>{{cite episode

''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' debuted in 2003 and quickly became both a surprise hit and one of the most talked-about television programs of 2003. The success of the show led to merchandising, franchising of the concept internationally, and a woman-oriented [[spin-off]], ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Girl]]''. The show's name was shortened to ''Queer Eye'' at the beginning of its third season to reflect the show's change in direction from making over only straight men to including women and gay people. ''Queer Eye'' ended production in June 2006<ref>{{cite web

==Cast==
The Fab Five are:
*'''[[Ted Allen]]''':  "[[Food]] and [[Wine]] [[Connoisseur]]," expert on food, [[alcohol]] and beverages, [[cooking]], and meal preparation
*'''[[Kyan Douglas]]''': "Grooming Guru," expert on [[hair]], grooming, personal [[hygiene]], and [[makeup]]
*'''[[Thom Filicia]]''': "Design Doctor," expert on [[interior design]] and home organization
*'''[[Carson Kressley]]''': "Fashion Savant," expert on [[clothing]], [[fashion]] and personal styling
*'''[[Jai Rodriguez]]''': "Culture Vulture," expert on [[popular culture]], relationships, and social interaction

==Production==
The pilot episode was filmed in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in June 2002. Of the eventual Fab Five, only Kressley and Allen appeared. The culture, design and grooming roles were filled by James Hannaham, Charles Daboub, Jr. and Sam Spector, respectively.<ref>{{Citation

The pilot was delivered to Bravo in September 2002 and was well-received in audience testing. Shortly thereafter [[NBC]] purchased Bravo and ordered 12 episodes of the series. NBC heavily promoted the show, including [[billboard]] campaigns and print ads in national magazines.<ref name = Advocate />

Kyan Douglas and Thom Filicia joined the show for these episodes, along with [[Blair Boone]] in the role of "culture guy". Boone filmed two episodes (which aired as the second and third episodes and for which he was credited as a "guest culture expert") but was replaced by Rodriquez beginning with production of the third episode.<ref>{{Citation

Each episode was shot over a span of four days and edited to create the conceit that the events of the episode take place in a single day.<ref name = Advocate />

==Format==
The majority of ''Queer Eye'' episodes follow the same basic format. The episode opens with the Fab Five in an [[SUV]] (usually in [[New York City]] where the series was based) discussing their straight subject. The Five review details of the subject's personal life and note problems in their various areas of expertise. The Five usually have a specific event for which they plan to prepare the subject. These have included everything from throwing a backyard barbecue for friends to preparing to ask for a salary raise to proposing marriage.

Upon arriving at the subject's home, the Fab Five go through his belongings, keeping up a running commentary of catty remarks about the state of his wardrobe, home decor, cleanliness and grooming. They also speak with the subject and family members to get an idea of the sort of style they like and their goals for the experience and to discuss the planned event.

[[Image:Tv bravo queer eye for the straight guy logo.jpg|thumb|left|Queer Eye logo for the first and second season]]
The remainder of the first half of the episode follows the Fab Five as they escort the subject to various locales to select new furniture and clothes. Often, Ted demonstrates how to select and prepare food for a particular dish that the subject will prepare for the special event, Kyan takes him for spa treatments and a new haircut. Each such segment includes a style tip superimposed on the screen, summarizing in a sentence or two the style issues addressed in the segment. Interspersed with this are interview segments in which friends and family members of the subject discuss his style issues.

In the next section, the subject returns to a completely redecorated home and models articles of his new wardrobe for the Fab Five. Each of the Five offer final words of advice and encouragement and a last [[Polari#Zhoosh|tszuj]], accompanied by supplies of grooming products, food, and kitchenware, and in some cases big-ticket electronics items such as entertainment centers and computers.

The final section follows the subject as he prepares for the special event, with the Fab Five watching edited footage of his preparations and critiquing how well or how poorly he followed their advice. Finally, the subject is followed through the event itself, with the Five again keeping up a running commentary and the subject often expressing his deep gratitude to the Fab Five for their counsel. A final tip from each of the Fab Five, usually relating to one of the topics covered in the episode, plays just before the credits.

Special episodes of ''Queer Eye'' that deviated from this formula included episodes in which the Fab Five journeyed outside the greater New York area, including shows filmed in England, Texas, and Las Vegas. In two episodes the Fab Five made over gay men (both of which aired during June, Gay Pride Month, in 2004 and 2006), and one episode making over a female-to-male transgender person. The show also featured makeovers of members of the [[Boston Red Sox]] following their 2004 [[World Series]] victory, several holiday specials and, in the final season, a "Mister Straight Guy" [[beauty pageant|pageant]] featuring subjects from across the show's history.

The popularity of the series inspired a number of parodies. Notably, [[Comedy Central]] hosted a [[satire|satrical]] television series called ''[[Straight Plan for the Gay Man]]'', which featured four heterosexual men teaching gay men how to be more (stereotypically) straight, redecorating their homes with neon beer signs and teaching them about sports. ''[[South Park]]'' spoofed the show and its hosts in the episode "[[South Park Is Gay!]]", in which the protagonists learn that the Fab Five are actually evil [[Crab People]] trying to take over the world by turning all straight men into [[metrosexual]]s.

''Queer Eye'' won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2004 and was nominated for another Emmy in the same category in 2005. The series also received [[GLAAD Media Awards]] for Outstanding Reality Program in 2004 and 2005, and was nominated for a third in 2006.<ref>{{cite web

In the second season, ratings dropped sharply, averaging around 1.8 million viewers per episode<ref name = Advocatetwo /> with an average 804,000 viewers in the important 18-40 demographic.<ref name = AfterElton /> New episodes continued to air for two more seasons.

== Franchises and spin-off series ==
''Queer Eye'''s American success led television networks in several countries to syndicate the American episodes, and some purchased licenses to create versions of ''Queer Eye'' for broadcast in their countries. However, few of these homegrown versions have proven as successful as the original, and most did not last long before cancellation.

NBC licensed [[Viasat]] to produce local versions for Scandanavia and [[Flextech]]'s [[Living (channel)|Living]] channel did the same to produce the United Kingdom's version.<ref>{{cite web

[[Australia]]'s take on the show premiered on [[Network Ten]] in early 2005 but was cancelled after three episodes; a Spanish version named ''[[Operaci<U+00F3>n G]]'' aired on [[Antena 3]] for only a few weeks; the German equivalent ''[[Schwul macht cool]]'' was cancelled on [[RTL 2]] after six episodes; ''[[:fr:Queer, Cinq Experts dans le Vent|Queer, Cinq Experts dans le Vent]]'' was shown in [[France]] on [[TF1]] for eight episodes in [[2004]]; and ''[[Esquadr<U+00E3>o G]]'', a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] version of the show, was cancelled in [[Portugal]] after the end of the first season.

In January 2005, Scout Productions premiered a spin-off series titled  ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Girl]]'', set in Los Angeles. It featured a cast of four lifestyle experts (three men and a woman known as the "Gal Pals") who performed makeovers for women. The show was cancelled after one season.
