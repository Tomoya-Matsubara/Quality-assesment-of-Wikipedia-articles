'''Iridium''' is the [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ir''' and [[atomic number]] 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white [[transition metal]] of the [[platinum group|platinum family]], iridium is the second-[[density|densest]] element (after [[osmium]]) and is the most [[corrosion]]-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. Although only certain molten salts and [[halogen]]s are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.

Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural [[platinum]]. [[Smithson Tennant]], the primary discoverer, named the iridium for the Greek goddess [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|one of the rarest elements]] in the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]], with annual production and consumption of only three [[tonne]]s. <sup>191</sup>Ir and <sup>193</sup>Ir are the only two naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of iridium as well as the only [[stable isotope]]s; the latter is the more abundant of the two.

The most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with [[chlorine]], though iridium also forms a number of [[organometallic compound]]s used in industrial [[catalysis]], and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-end [[spark plug]]s, [[crucible]]s for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the [[chloralkali process]]. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.

Iridium is found in meteorites with an abundance much higher than its average abundance in the Earth's crust. For this reason the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene boundary]] gave rise to the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene extinction event|extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 65&nbsp;million years ago]]. It is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum group metals, the high density and [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|tendency]] of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.

A member of the [[platinum group]] [[metal]]s, iridium is white, resembling [[platinum]], but with a slight yellowish cast. Because of its [[hardness]], brittleness, and very high [[melting point]], solid iridium is difficult to machine, form, or work, and thus [[powder metallurgy]] is commonly employed instead.<ref name="greenwood" /> It is the only metal to maintain good mechanical properties in air at temperatures above 1600&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (2912 <U+00B0>F).<ref name="hunt" /> Iridium has a very high [[boiling point]] ([[List of elements by boiling point|10th among all elements]]) and becomes a [[superconductor]] at temperatures below 0.14&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kittel |first=C.|title=Introduction to Solid state Physics, 7th Edition |publisher=Wiley-India |year=2004 |isbn=81-265-1045-5}}</ref>

Iridium's [[modulus of elasticity]] is the second-highest among the metals, only being surpassed by [[osmium]].<ref name="hunt" /> This, together with a high [[shear modulus]] and a very low figure for [[Poisson's ratio]] (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral [[strain (chemistry)|strain]]), indicate the high degree of [[stiffness]] and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.<ref name="hunt" />

The measured [[density]] of iridium is only slightly lower (by about 0.12%) than that of [[osmium]], the [[List of elements by density|densest element]] known.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Osmium, the Densest Metal Known|author=Arblaster, J.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of iridium}}
Iridium has two naturally occurring, stable [[isotope]]s, <sup>191</sup>Ir and <sup>193</sup>Ir, with [[natural abundance]]s of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively.<ref name="nubase" /> At least 34 [[radioisotope]]s have also been synthesized, ranging in [[mass number]] from 164 to 199. [[iridium-192|<sup>192</sup>Ir]], which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a [[half-life]] of 73.827&nbsp;days, and finds application in [[brachytherapy]]<ref name="mager" /> and in industrial [[radiography]], particularly for non-destructive testing of welds in steel in the oil and gas industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day<U+2014><sup>188</sup>Ir, <sup>189</sup>Ir, <sup>190</sup>Ir.<ref name="nubase" /> Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of [[Beta decay#<U+03B2><U+2212> decay|<U+03B2><sup>+</sup> decay]], [[alpha decay|<U+03B1> decay]], and [[proton emission]], with the exceptions of <sup>189</sup>Ir, which decays by [[electron capture]], and <sup>190</sup>Ir, which decays by [[positron emission]]. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by [[Beta decay#<U+03B2>+ decay|<U+03B2><sup><U+2212></sup> decay]], although <sup>192</sup>Ir also has a minor [[electron capture]] decay path.<ref name="nubase">{{cite journal| last = Audi| first = G.| title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3<U+2013>128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| year = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode = 2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H. }}</ref> All known isotopes of iridium were discovered between 1934 and 2001; the most recent is <sup>171</sup>Ir.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The discoverers of the iridium isotopes: the thirty-six known iridium isotopes found between 1934 and 2001|author=Arblaster, J.

At least 32 [[nuclear isomer|metastable isomers]] have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable of these is <sup>192m2</sup>Ir, which decays by [[isomeric transition]] with a half-life of 241&nbsp;years,<ref name="nubase" /> making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is <sup>190m3</sup>Ir with a half-life of only 2&nbsp;<U+00B5>s.<ref name="nubase" /> The isotope <sup>191</sup>Ir was the first one of any element to be shown to present a [[M<U+00F6>ssbauer effect]]. This renders it useful for [[M<U+00F6>ssbauer spectroscopy]] for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.<ref name="ir-191" />

Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in [[aqua regia]] (a mixture of [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] and [[nitric acid]]s) to create soluble salts.

British scientist [[John George Children]] was the first to melt a sample of iridium in 1813 with the aid of "the greatest galvanic battery that has ever been constructed" (at that time).<ref name="hunt" /> The first to obtain high purity iridium was [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]] in 1842. He found that it had a density of around 21.8&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> and noted that the metal is nearly unmalleable and very hard. The first melting in appreciable quantity was done by [[Henri Sainte-Claire Deville]] and Jules Henri Debray in 1860. They required burning more than 300&nbsp;L of pure {{chem|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2}} for each kilogram of iridium.<ref name="hunt" />

These extreme difficulties in melting the metal limited the possibilities for handling iridium. [[John Isaac Hawkins]] was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880 [[John Holland (pen maker)|John Holland]] and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding [[phosphorus]] and patented the process in the United States; British company [[Johnson Matthey]] later stated that they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium at a number of [[World's fair|World Fairs]].<ref name="hunt" /> The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in [[thermocouple]]s was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref name="hunt" />

Within the Earth's crust, iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked from one of the former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the [[Bushveld igneous complex]] in [[South Africa]],<ref name="kirk-pt" /> though the large copper<U+2013>nickel deposits near [[Norilsk#Norilsk-Talnakh nickel deposits|Norilsk]] in [[Russia]], and the [[Sudbury Basin]] in [[Canada]] are also significant sources of iridium.

Iridium is obtained commercially as a by-product from [[nickel]] and [[copper]] mining and processing. During [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrorefining of copper]] and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals as well as [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] settle to the bottom of the cell as ''anode mud'', which forms the starting point for their extraction.<ref name=usgs/> To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with [[sodium peroxide]] followed by dissolution in [[aqua regia]], and dissolution in a mixture of [[chlorine]] with [[hydrochloric acid]].<ref name="ullmann-pt" /><ref name="kirk-pt" />

After it is dissolved, iridium is separated from the other platinum group metals by precipitating {{chem|(NH|4|)|2|IrCl|6}} or by extracting {{chem|IrCl|6|2-}} with organic amines.<ref>{{cite journal| title = The Platinum Metals| first = Raleigh| last = Gilchrist| journal = Chemical Reviews| year = 1943| volume = 32| issue = 3| pages = 277<U+2013>372| doi = 10.1021/cr60103a002}}</ref> The first method is similar to the procedure Tennant and Wollaston used for their separation. The second method can be planned as continuous [[liquid<U+2013>liquid extraction]] and is therefore more suitable for industrial scale production.

The price of iridium fluctuates considerably, as shown in the table, because of unstable supply, demand, [[speculation]], and hoarding, amplified by the small size of the market and instability in the producing countries. The sharp decrease around 2003 has been related to the oversupply of Ir crucibles used for industrial growth of large single crystals.<ref name=usgs/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hagel<U+00FC>ken, C. |journal=Metall |volume=60 |issue=1<U+2013>2 |year=2006 |pages=31<U+2013>42 |title=Markets for the catalysts metals platinum, palladium, and rhodium |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090304195307/http://www.preciousmetals.umicore.com/publications/articles_by_umicore/general/show_Metal_PGMmarkets_200602.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Applications==
The demand for iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, mostly because of electronics-related applications that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes <U+2013> iridium crucibles are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of Ir in 2007, electrodes for the [[chloralkali process]] (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).<ref name=usgs/><ref name="platinum2008">{{cite book| first = D.| last = Jollie| title=Platinum 2008|publisher=Johnson Matthey|year=2008| issn = 0268-7305|url=http://www.platinum.matthey.com/uploaded_files/Pt2008/08_complete_publication.pdf| format = PDF|accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref>

The high melting point, hardness and corrosion resistance of iridium and its alloys determine most of its applications. Iridium and especially iridium<U+2013>platinum alloys or osmium<U+2013>iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinnerets]], through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as [[rayon]].<ref>{{cite journal|title= Spinnerets for viscose rayon cord yarn| journal = Fibre Chemistry| volume =10| issue = 4| year = 1979| doi = 10.1007/BF00543390| pages = 377<U+2013>378| first = R.

Corrosion and heat resistance makes iridium an important alloying agent.

These catalysts have been used in the synthesis of [[natural product]]s and able to hydrogenate certain difficult substrates, such as unfunctionalized alkenes, enantioselectively (generating only one of the two possible [[enantiomer]]s).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/chem.200500755|year=2006|author=K<U+00E4>llstr<U+00F6>m, K; Munslow, I; Andersson, P.

===Historical===
[[File:Fountain-pen-nib.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Fountain pen]] nib labeled ''Iridium Point''|alt=Fountain pen tip made of yellowish metal]]
Iridium<U+2013>osmium alloys were used to tip [[fountain pen]] nibs. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold.<ref name="hunt" /> Since 1944, the famous [[Parker 51]] fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called "iridium", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as tungsten have taken its place.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nibs.com/ArticleIndex.html|journal=The PENnant|volume=XIII|issue=2|year=1999|title=Notes from the Nib Works<U+2014>Where's the Iridium?|author=Mottishaw, J.}}</ref>

An iridium<U+2013>platinum alloy was used for the [[touch hole]]s or vent pieces of [[cannon]]. According to a report of the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exhibition of 1867]], one of the pieces being exhibited by [[Johnson and Matthey]] "has been used in a Withworth gun for more than 3000 rounds, and scarcely shows signs of wear yet. Those who know the constant trouble and expense which are occasioned by the wearing of the vent-pieces of cannon when in active service, will appreciate this important adaptation".<ref>{{cite journal|editor=Crookes, W.|volume=XV|year=1867|journal=The Chemical News and Journal of Physical Science|title=The Paris Exhibition|pages=182 }}</ref>

The pigment ''iridium black'', which consists of very finely divided iridium, is used for painting [[porcelain]] an intense black; it was said that "all other porcelain black colors appear grey by the side of it".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Playbook of Metals: Including Personal Narratives of Visits to Coal, Lead, Copper, and Tin Mines, with a Large Number of Interesting Experiments Relating to Alchemy and the Chemistry of the Fifty Metallic Elements|author=Pepper, J.

==Precautions==
Iridium in bulk metallic form is not biologically important or hazardous to health due to its lack of reactivity with tissues; there are only about 20&nbsp;[[parts per notation|parts per trillion]] of iridium in human tissue.<ref name="Emsley" /> However, finely divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.<ref name="kirk-pt">{{cite book|title=Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|first =R. J.| last = Seymour| coauthors = O'Farrelly, J. I.|chapter=Platinum-group metals|doi=10.1002/0471238961.1612012019052513.a01.pub2|year=2001|publisher=Wiley}}</ref>
Very little is known about the toxicity of iridium compounds because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself.<ref name="mager" /> However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.<ref name="Emsley" />

A radioisotope of iridium, {{chem|192|Ir}}, is dangerous like other radioactive isotopes. The only reported injuries related to iridium concern accidental exposure to radiation from {{chem|192|Ir}} used in [[brachytherapy]].<ref name="mager">{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety|first =J.| last = Mager Stellman| chapter=Iridium|isbn=978-92-2-109816-4|year=1998|publisher=International Labour Organization| pages =63.19| url = http://books.google.com/?id=nDhpLa1rl44C&pg=PT125|oclc=35279504 45066560}}</ref> High-energy gamma radiation from {{chem|192|Ir}} can increase the risk of cancer.
