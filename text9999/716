'''Hugo Reid''' (1809 - 1852) was a resident of [[Los Angeles, California]] who wrote a series of newspaper letters that described the culture, language, and modern circumstances of the local [[Tongva|''Gabrieli<U+00F1>o'']] Indians and criticized their treatment under the [[Franciscan]] mission system.

==Life==
Born in 1809 or 1810{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} in [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]], [[Scotland]], Reid came to the United States as a sailor and jumped ship at Los Angeles in 1832. He married a ''Gabrieli<U+00F1>o'' woman named Victoria and adopted her children, Maria and Felipe. 

Reid was granted the {{convert|13319|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Rancho Santa Anita]] land grant by Mexican Governor [[Pio Pico]] in 1845. His rancho home, known as the [[Hugo Reid Adobe]], is located on the former estate of [[Lucky Baldwin]] at the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]] in what is now [[Arcadia, California|the town of Arcadia]].

Reid  published a series of 22 letters in the ''Los Angeles Star'' during 1852 which provide an important ethnographic picture of the little&ndash;known ''Gabrieli<U+00F1>o'' and were republished in book form several times. He died in Los Angeles on December 12, 1852.

==Legacy==
Arcadia's Hugo Reid Elementary School is named after Reid.

Hugo Reid is also a part of the history of [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California]].  The geography of the area was reminiscent of Scotland, so he named the reservoir [http://www.silverlake.org/images/historic%20photos/jpeg/ivanhoeres.jpg ''Ivanhoe''] after the 1819 novel [[Ivanhoe]] by [[Sir Walter Scott]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  Many of the streets in the area are named after characters in that novel, such as [[Rowena]] and Herkimer.  Other streets merely have Scottish names, like [[St. George]].
