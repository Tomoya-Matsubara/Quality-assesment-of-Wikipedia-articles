A group of activists issued the "People's Communiqu<U+00E9> No 1", which imitated the titles of communiqu<U+00E9>s from the Army. It demanded the dissolution of the cabinet Mubarak appointed on the 29 January, the suspension of the parliament elected in late 2010 in a poll that was widely suspected of being rigged, the creation of a transitional presidential council made up of four civilians and one member of the military, the formation of a transitional government to prepare for an election to take place within nine months and a body to draft a new democratic constitution, freedom for the media and syndicates and for the formation of political parties, and the scrapping of military and emergency courts. They also announced the formation of a council to organize mass protests.<ref name="reuterscomm1">[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/12/us-egypt-protesters-idUSTRE71B17Q20110212 Egypt protest leaders vow to protect revolution].

On the 21 February, [[David Cameron]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, became the first world leader to visit Egypt since Mubarak was ousted as the president.

A government reshuffle took place on the 22 February, but the defense, interior, foreign, finance, and justice ministries remained unchanged.

The changes were not well-received by the public, due to the fact that most of Mubarak's former supporters remained in the cabinet, and there were renewed calls for a demonstration to demand the resignation of the interim government.<ref>{{cite web|author=By Reuters |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/egypt-swears-in-new-cabinet-retains-mubarak-era-ministers-1.345069 |title=Egypt swears in new cabinet, retains Mubarak-era ministers <U+2013> Haaretz Daily Newspaper &#124; Israel News |work=Haaretz |location=Israel |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref> Protesters were also set to return to Tahrir Square to keep up the pressure on the interim government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE70O18Y20110225 |title=Egyptians pack Tahrir for protest and celebration &#124; World &#124; Reuters |publisher=Af.reuters.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref>

On the 5 March, three weeks after Hosni Mubarak was ousted as President, Egyptians turned their anger toward his internal security apparatus by storming the agency's main headquarters and other offices in order to seize documents that would provide evidence of human rights abuses as well as preventing said documents from being destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2011/03/05/egyptians_storm_state_security_building_in_cairo/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+Boston+Globe+--+World+News |title=Egyptians turn anger toward state security agency |publisher=http://www.boston.com/news |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> Following rumors that officials were destroying evidence, 200 protesters stormed the secret police headquarters in Cairo.

On 1 April, protesters called for a "Save the Revolution" day in which thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square after Friday prayers demanded that the ruling military council move faster to dismantle lingering aspects of the old regime; it was the largest protest since Mubarak's resignation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/middleeast/02egypt.html?_r=1 |title=Protesters Scold Egypt<U+2019>s Military Council |publisher=Neil MacFarquhar |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>

On 3 April, the Muslim Brotherhood called on its members to participate in the demonstrations in Tahrir Square on 8 April. Having withheld support for demonstrations held on 1 April because they coincided with [[Orphans' Day]], the Brotherhood called for a large turnout to pressure the government to pursue cases against members of the old regime who remained in positions of influence after the revolution. The Brotherhood also suggested the name "Friday of Purging" for the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/390242 |title=Brotherhood urges heavy participation in "Friday of Purging" |publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=3 April 2011|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> The next day, employees of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Amonsito Textile Company demonstrated outside cabinet offices.{{Why?|date=July 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/9295/Egypt/Politics-/Workers-protest-in-front-of-Egypts-Cabinet.aspx |title=Workers protest in front of Egypt's Cabinet - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>

On 7 April, the National Association for Change seemed to accept the Brotherhood's proposal, calling for the "Friday of Prosecution and Purging", a million-man march on Tahrir Square, on 8 April. The NAC also proposed holding a mock "people's trial" of the regime figures for whom they demand the prosecution and/or removal of. While Friday protests in Tahrir Square had been a weekly event, million-man protests had not been seen for some time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/390242 |title=NAC calls for "Friday of Purging" demonstration |publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=7 April 2011|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> The following day, protesters called for a "Friday of Cleansing" in which hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square again. They criticised the ruling SCAF for not following through on the protesters' previous demands. They called for the resignation of the remaining Mybarak-era figures and the removal of Egypt<U+2019>s public prosecutor due to the slow pace of investigations of corrupt former officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/391552 |title=Tens of thousands in Tahrir as some threaten to extend protests &#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date= |accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref>

Egypt also eased the blockade at the Rafah border crossing with [[Gaza]]. Women, children, and men over 40 were allowed to pass freely while men aged between 18 and 40 would still require a permit. Though trade across the border remained prohibited, the crossing was opened between 9:00 - 21:00 every day except on Fridays and public holidays.

On the 6 June, crowds of Egyptians dressed in black held demonstrations to honour [[Khaled Said]], a young man from Alexandria who was beaten to death in 2010 in a savage attack which was blamed on police. This attack helped inspire the uprising that brought down Egypt's president.<ref>{{cite news|title=Egypt remembers man whose death sparked revolution|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-06-06/world/29628236_1_large-protest-police-abuse-silent-demonstration|accessdate=1 July 2011|newspaper=SFGate.com|date=6 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref><ref name="amnesty1">{{cite web|title=A year since Khaled Said<U+2019>s death, Egypt still waits for justice|url=http://livewire.amnesty.org/2011/06/06/a-year-since-khaled-saids-death-egypt-still-waits-for-justice/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> Pictures of his body, taken by his family in a morgue, caused public outrage that caused the January 2011 uprising.<ref name="amnesty1"/> Hundreds of protesters stood side by side on Stanley Bridge in Alexandria in a silent protest commemorating the death of Said.

By the time they arrived there, more people joined, and the number of protesters reached about 1,500. They set a big monitor on the street screening a documentary on Said<U+2019>s case and its development.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hundreds mark anniversary of Khaled Saeid's death in Alexandria, Cairo|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/egypt/hundreds-mark-anniversary-of-khaled-saeids-death-in-alexandria-cairo.html|publisher=thedailynewsegypt.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

On the 12 June, an accused Israeli spy, Ilan Grapel, was arrested by Egyptian authorities who said that Grapel was sent to Egypt to build a team that was <U+201C>trying to gather information and data and to monitor the events of the 25 January revolution."<ref name="newser1">{{cite web|title=Egypt Accuses American of Spying for Israel|url=http://www.newser.com/story/120869/egypt-accuses-american-of-spying-for-israel.html|publisher=newser.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> The authorities also said that Grapel tried to incite violence amongst Egyptian protestors, hoping to spark a face-off with the military <U+201C>and spread chaos in the Egyptian public and harm the state's political, economic, and social interests.<U+201D><ref name="newser1"/>  Grapel appears to be the same man who told Haaretz that he moved to Israel three years before its 2006 war with Lebanon and ended up enlisting in the Israeli Defense Force.

These reports are false.<U+201D>  Friends and relatives of Grapel said that he is a law student in Atlanta with an avid interest in the Middle East, and not a Mossad agent out to sabotage Egypt<U+2019>s revolution, as Egyptian authorities have charged. His mother said he arrived in Cairo in May, countering implications that he was involved in protests as early as February. The arrest of 27-year-old Ilan Grapel has sparked fears in Israel that relations with Egypt will sour now that Hosni Mubarak has been deposed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt spy allegations against Israeli denied by family, classmates|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-14/news/29657736_1_israel-and-egypt-egyptian-revolution-mossad|work=Boston Globe |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

On the 19 June, the military prosecution released the editor-in-chief of [[Al-Fagr]], Adel Hammouda, and journalist Rasha Azab without bail pending further investigation. They were both interrogated on charges of publishing false news that disturbed the peace and negligence in the editorial process.

On the 20 June, Mubarak's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said that in 2010 the former president underwent "critical surgery" in Heidelberg, Germany to remove his gallbladder and part of his pancreas which were cancerous. el-Deeb told The Associated Press that "there is evidence suggesting that there is a recurrence of cancer and that it has reached the stomach,". He called Mubarak's condition "horrible" and said the former leader "doesn't eat and he loses consciousness quite often." Mubarak is hospitalized in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where he has been living since he was removed from power.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawyer says Egypt's Mubarak may have cancer|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Lawyer-says-Egypt-s-Mubarak-may-have-cancer-1429973.php|publisher=seattlepi.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

On the 21 June, Egypt's military rulers launched an online poll to test the popularity of potential presidential candidates, a move that could be aimed at judging public opinion for former officials who were trying to run for positions of parliament again. The list includes at least four ex-military officers as well as Islamists, judges, diplomats and others. Most have declared that they will run, including two former officers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egyptian army tests political winds|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Egyptian+army+tests+political+winds/4978519/story.html|publisher=http://www.montrealgazette.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

On the 22 June, Egypt's cabinet approved a budget for the 2011<U+2013>2012 fiscal year, boosting spending in social programs to meet the growing demands from the people after the uprising. The budget totals <U+00A3>490.6&nbsp;billion ($83&nbsp;billion), reflecting a spending increase of 14.7% over the current fiscal year, while revenues are forecast at $59&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt approves $83B budget, boosts social spending|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/egypt-approves-83b-budget-boosts-social-spending-1.2976811|work=Newsday |location=New York |accessdate=1 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> On the same day, leaders of the youth wing of the Muslim Brotherhood have split with their elders to form an independent political party. This has deepened the fractures within the group as some of its prominent members have moved towards a more centrist and liberal version of Islamist politics. The new group, the [[Egyptian Current Party]], is expected to advocate the separation of religion from politics, the protection of individual freedoms and the embrace of Islamic morals and culture without the enforcement of Islamic religious law. Its founders, including Islam Lotfy, Mohamed el-Kasaas and Mohamed Abbas, were amongst the young leaders of the Egyptian revolution and broke with the Brotherhood to help lead the first day of protests that brought down Hosni Mubarak.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Egypt, Youth Wing Breaks From Muslim Brotherhood|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/world/middleeast/23egypt.html|publisher=http://www.nytimes.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

On the 26 June, [[John McCain]] and [[John Kerry]] visited Egypt at the head of a U.S. business delegation. Both politicians said that it was in America<U+2019>s national security interests to see that the uprising succeeded. They said that Washington was not interested in dictating policy to Egypt. Instead, the focus was on finding ways to help the Arab world<U+2019>s most populous nation boost its economy and address the needs of its people.<ref>{{cite web|title=McCain: Egypt military wants civilian government|url=http://www.longislandpress.com/2011/06/26/mccain-egypt-military-wants-civilian-government/|publisher=http://www.longislandpress.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

On the 28 June, Egyptian security forces clashed with around 5,000 protesters in central Cairo. According to witnesses and medical officials, dozens of demonstrators were injured. Clouds of tear gas engulfed Tahrir Square as the security forces battled to regain control of the central plaza from the demonstrators, many of whom had family members who were killed during the revolution. The families were frustrated with what they perceived to be the slow prosecution of security officers who were believed to be responsible for the deaths of some 850 protesters during the 18-day uprising in February. As Tuesday's clashes moved into early Wednesday morning, rocks and shattered glass littered the streets around Tahrir, as protesters chanted "Down with the military junta". The demonstrators used motorcycles to ferry the injured to safety.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egyptian security forces fire tear gas to disperse rock-throwing protesters in central Cairo|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d9o57bl01/egyptian-security-forces-fire-tear-gas-to-disperse-rock-throwing-protesters-in-central-cairo.html|publisher=www.newser.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> According to the Health Ministry some 1,036 people were injured, among them at least 40 policemen.

On the 8 July, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered for what they called the "Friday of Determination"<ref name="englishahram" /> or the "March of the Million" in Suez, Alexandria, Cairo and other cities. They demanded immediate reforms and swifter [[Trials and judicial hearings following the 2011 Egyptian revolution|prosecution of former officials]] from the ousted government. Revolutionaries in Tahrir square also began another sit-in which is still ongoing.

Most of Egypt's political parties and coalitions supported widespread calls for the protest to be staged across Egypt.<ref name="aljazeera1">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2011/07/20117810134178303.html |title=New protests rage across Egypt <U+2013> Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> The protesters hoped to start a "second revolution".<ref name="aljazeera1"/> The main demand of these groups is to combine efforts toward achieving the goals of the revolution, including: [[Human rights in Egypt under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|banning the trial of civilians by military courts]]; setting a minimum wage; bringing Mubarak, his sons and the senior officials to justice quickly; banning former National Democratic Party (NDP) members from political activity for five years; releasing all political prisoners; purging the police, the legal system, the media, the universities and the banks of members of the former regime; electing new municipal councils; stopping the exportation of natural gas to Israel;<ref name="memri1"/> the arrest and trial of those responsible for killing protesters and restructuring the ministry of interior.

Several stages have been set up by the [[Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution|Revolution Youth Coalition]] (a coalition of liberal parties and movements), the Muslim Brotherhood, the Wafd party and leftist parties in order to organise the protests. As the Muslim Brotherhood<U+2019>s stage was the highest and largest, many protesters complained that they were attempting to gain an unfair advantage over the other political parties. These accusations were also compounded by the Muslim Brotherhood's opposition to a sit-in called by other political groups to pressure the Supreme Council of Armed Forces into meeting their demands. Though the Muslim Brotherhood decided to join the protests only two days before the event, it said that it would avoid the sit-in and leave by 17:00. The event was used to rally support for the various groups by organizing their own tents and passing out paraphernalia.<ref name="englishahram">{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/15899/Egypt/Politics-/Hundreds-of-thousands-revitalise-Egypts-revolution.aspx |title=Hundreds of thousands revitalise Egypt's revolution on Determination Friday <U+2013> Politics <U+2013> Egypt <U+2013> Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref>

On 11 July, Prime Minister Essam Sharaf made a televised statement reassuring protesters that the government would respond to public demands and also included a timeline in which these demands would be met. The changes included a new cabinet to be formed within one week and a change in provincial governors before the end of the month. The protesters responded with calls for a million-man march the following day and continuation of their sit-in in Tahrir Square. The Muslim Brotherhood responded that they will not participate in the sit-in. The next morning the SCAF issued a statement,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thememriblog.org/blog_personal/en/39250.htm |title=Military Council in Egypt: We Support The People's Demands; We Will Not Submit to Protestor Violence |publisher=Thememriblog.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref> which was perceived as aggressive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_63395.shtml |title=Mass protests continue against Egyptian regimeWith Photo Essay &#124; Egypt |publisher=Axisoflogic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>

On 13 July, state television reported that Egypt's government had met a key demand of protesters by firing nearly 700 top police officers in order to cleanse the discredited and widely unpopular force.<ref name="newser2">{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d9oesgcg2/state-tv-egypt-fires-nearly-700-senior-officers-as-part-of-cleansing-police-force.html |title=State TV: Egypt fires nearly 700 senior officers as part of cleansing police force - 7/13/2011 11:30:46 AM |publisher=Newser |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref> It was also reported that 37 of the dismissed officers face charges of killing protesters. Among those dismissed were 505 major-generals, including 10 of the interior minister's top assistants, 82 colonels and 82 brigadiers.<ref name="newser2"/>

On 14 July, Mubarak told prosecutors that he did not order security forces to open fire on protesters during the initial uprising in February. Transcripts of prosecutors questioning Mubarak were published in two Egyptian newspapers{{Which?|date=July 2011}}, and judicial officials confirmed the authenticity of the documents.<ref name="voanews1">{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Egyptian-Media-Mubarak-Denies-Ordering-Police-to-Fire-on-Protesters-125577073.html |title=Egyptian Media: Mubarak Denies Ordering Police to Fire on Protesters &#124; Middle East &#124; English |publisher=Voanews.com |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>  Mubarak said he issued clear instructions for police not to use force against the protesters. He also denied charges that he ordered or had knowledge of security forces firing on the demonstrators.<ref name="voanews1"/>

On 16 July, Maj. Gen. Tarek el-Mahdi briefly visited a protest camp in Tahrir Square but left after protesters, some holding shoes in anger, booed him off a stage. He had come to persuade a dozen demonstrators to end a hunger strike which had begun several days ago. El-Mahdi later told state television that he was disappointed that a small crowd of protesters managed to drive him out of the square before he could reach the tent housing the hunger strikers.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Deeb |first=Sarah El |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43780050/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/ |title=Senior Egyptian military official heckled - World news - Mideast/N.

He then appointed two new deputies, one of which was prominent economist and former head of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Hazem el-Biblawi.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

On 17 July, Sharaf named 12 new Cabinet members. State television dubbed the new government lineup the "Revolution Cabinet." Most of the ministers were newcomers as the government sought to placate further criticism by the protesters. Despite the cabinet reshuffle, many of the protesters said that they had no intention of calling off their week-old sit-in.<ref name="sfgate1">{{cite web|author=By SARAH EL DEEB, Associated Press |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/07/17/international/i085051D98.DTL |title=Egypt military rulers name electoral council head |publisher=Sfgate.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref> One of the prominent{{Or|date=July 2011}} members of the "Revolution Cabinet" is the Chief of Antiquities [[Zahi Hawass]]. Hawass is a prominant member of Egypts archaeological community, but has been the target of protests himself. These protests were begun by archaeology students who accused him of falsely claiming publicity for himself and corruption.
Sharaf also accepted the resignation of Finance Minister Samir Radwan (the reason for his resignation was due to the fact that his new budget was deemed by many protestors to be too conservative in dealing with the poverty which had been one of the main catalysts of the uprising) and the foreign minister, who was replaced by the former ambassador to Saudia Arabia, Mohammed Kamel Omar. Radwan's position was taken by prominent economist Hazem el-Biblawi, who had also been appointed deputy prime minister. There were also changes in the ministries of transport, military production, higher education, communication, agriculture, health, religious endowments, local development, trade and industry and civil aviation, with ministers being replaced.<ref name="sfgate1"/>

On 21 July, the SCAF announced that it would bar foreign monitors in the upcoming [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary election]] because of what it claimed was the preservation of Egyptian sovereingty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/07/2011720222415556480.html |title=Egypt not to allow foreign poll monitors - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}</ref>

The violence broke out following a televised speech commemorating the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 coup]] by Field Marshal [[Mohammed Hussein Tantawi]], head of the ruling military council, who attempted to diffuse tensions by praising young people who led the uprising that toppled [[Mubarak]].<ref name="reuters1"/><ref name="autogenerated2"/> The clashes broke out after civilians threw rocks from rooftops in adjacent buildings. Many in the crowd were thought by protesters to be thugs but some residents of the Abbassiya district were fearful protests in their neighborhood were obstructing business and normalcy. State media said the civilians fighting with the demonstrators were from "people's committees" protecting the neighborhood and the army had maintained all self-restraint, blaming the violence on protesters. Some Abbasiya residents appeared to believe protesters were seeking to create rifts between the army and the people.<ref name="reuters1"/> Military police, armed with Tasers and batons, fired in the air to stop the demonstrators from approaching the Defense Ministry. A Reuters witness said tear gas fumes were wafting outside the area as military helicopters circled overhead. The Health Ministry stated a total of 231 people were wounded in the violence.<ref>[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/479969 Number of wounded in el-Abasseya events rises to 231] Almasry Alyoum</ref>
