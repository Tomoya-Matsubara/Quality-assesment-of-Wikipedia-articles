'''Johann B<U+00E4>mler''' (sometimes '''Johannes B<U+00E4>mler''', '''Johann Baemler''' or '''Hans Bemler''',<ref name="grove">{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=1|pages=119-120}}</ref> 1430<U+2013>1503) was a printer, [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator]] and bookseller from [[Augsburg]], Germany.<ref>{{emc1|Birgit M<U+00FC>nch|B<U+00E4>mler, Johann|140}}</ref>

B<U+00E4>mler is mentioned in Augusburgian city records from 1453 as a scribe and from 1477 as a printer. He appears to have begun his career as an illuminator and [[calligraphy|calligrapher]]; a few illuminated manuscript pages and books decorated by calligraphy by his hand survive to this day (in the [[Free Library of Philadelphia]], [[Bavarian State Library]], [[Herzog August Library]], [[Morgan Library & Museum]] and others).<ref name="grove"/>

He probably learnt the art of print-making in the shop of [[G<U+00FC>nther Zainer]]. The first printed book by B<U+00E4>mler appeared in April 1472, and the first illustrated printed book from his workshop in September 1473. He based his [[typeface]]s on local cursive script, and they are considered to have contributed to the development of the [[Schwabacher]]. Approximately half of the books printed in his printing office were illustrated with [[woodcuts]] or other decorative elements.<ref name="grove"/>

He belonged to the guild of painters, glassmakers, woodcut-makers and goldbeaters, and eventually reached a high position within the guild. His printing activity ceased in 1495.<ref name="grove"/>
