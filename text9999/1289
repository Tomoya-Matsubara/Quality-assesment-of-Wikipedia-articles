'''Harry Clifton "Curley" Byrd''' (February 12, 1889 &ndash; October 2, 1970) was an American university administrator, educator, athlete, coach, and politician. Byrd began a long association with the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] as an undergraduate in 1905, and eventually rose to the position of [[President of the University of Maryland, College Park|university president]] from 1936 to 1954.

In the interim, he had also served as the university's [[athletic director]] and head coach for the [[Maryland Terrapins football|football]] and [[Maryland Terrapins baseball|baseball teams]]. Byrd amassed a 119&ndash;82&ndash;15 record in football from 1911 to 1934 and 88&ndash;73&ndash;4 record in baseball from 1913 to 1923. [[Byrd Stadium]], the university's current football field, and [[Old Byrd Stadium|its predecessor]] were both named in his honor. In graduate school at [[Georgetown University]], he became one of football's early users of the newly legalized [[forward pass]], and he had a brief baseball career including one season as [[pitcher]] for the [[San Francisco Seals]].

Byrd resigned as university president in order to enter politics in 1954. He ran an unsuccessful campaign as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic candidate]] for [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] against [[Theodore McKeldin]]. Byrd later received appointments to state offices with responsibilities in the [[Potomac River]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]]. In the 1960s, he made unsuccessful bids for seats in each chamber of the [[United States Congress]]. Byrd was a proponent of a "[[separate but equal]]" status of racial segregation in his roles as both university administrator and political candidate.

==Early life==
Harry Clifton Byrd was born on February 12, 1889, in [[Crisfield, Maryland]]. He was one of six children of [[wikt:oysterman|oysterman]] and county commissioner William Franklin Byrd and his wife Sallie May Byrd.<ref name=papers/> In his youth, Byrd worked in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] fishing industry, where he saved most of his money to finance his college education.<ref name=somerset>Jason Rhodes, [http://books.google.com/books?id=9AQghKFhr38C ''Somerset County, Maryland: A Brief History''], pp. 111&ndash;a112, The History Press, 2007, ISBN 1-59629-273-3.</ref> He attended [[Crisfield High School]], where he excelled on the [[baseball]] diamond, and was also known as his hometown's first recreational [[jogging|jogger]].<ref name=somerset/>

A later source described how he appeared in 1905:<blockquote>"He was tall, and as the saying goes, built like a whip. He had a startlingly handsome face, with big, flashing eyes, a splotch of florid red on each cheek, and a mane of black curly hair&nbsp;... He looked like [[Rupert of Hentzau]], and had all of that worthy's cold, sinister resolution about everything that he did."<ref>[[James Mallahan Cain]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Mlxs1F0AZCwC ''60 Years of Journalism''], p. 120, Popular Press, 1985, ISBN 0-87972-327-0.</ref></blockquote>

==College career==
[[File:Curley Byrd 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Byrd as a senior at Maryland in 1908]]
In 1905, Byrd graduated from Crisfield High School and enrolled at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland Agricultural College]], which is now known as the University of Maryland.<ref name=somerset/> Byrd was a star college athlete and participated in varsity [[Maryland Terrapins football|football]], [[Maryland Terrapins baseball|baseball]], and track. He served as the football team captain in 1907, as the [[pitcher]] on the baseball team, and set a school record 10.0-second [[100-yard dash]] in track.<ref name=cole/> Before leaving Crisfield, Byrd's father warned him not to "try to play that thing called football."<ref name=bealle50>Morris Allison Bealle, ''Kings of American Football: The University of Maryland, 1890&ndash;1952'', p. 50, Columbia Publishing Co., 1952.</ref> He ignored the advice and reported for football practice where head coach [[Fred K. Nielsen]] told the undersized Byrd to "play with the kids" and that "football's a man's game."<ref>Bealle, p. 49.</ref> He was allowed, however, to fill in as an [[end (American football)|end]] on the [[scout team]] due to a shortage of players.<ref name=bealle50/> After sitting out the first three games, Nielsen sent Byrd in as a substitute against {{cfb link|year=1905|team=Navy Midshipmen|title=Navy}}, and his play was impressive enough to earn a position on the first team. After the elder Byrd read of his son's newfound stardom in the newspaper, he wrote, "Since you're going to play football, I'm glad to see you're doing it well."<ref>Bealle, pp. 50&ndash;53.</ref> During the summers and on weekends, Byrd supplemented his income by continuing work as a fisherman.<ref name=somerset/> He graduated [[salutatorian|second in his class]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1908.<ref name=papers>[http://www.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=/MdU.ead.histms.0070.xml Harry Clifton Byrd papers], [[University of Maryland Libraries]], retrieved July 4, 2010.</ref>

After graduation from Maryland, Byrd spent the next three years doing graduate work in law and journalism at [[George Washington University]], [[Georgetown University]], and [[McDaniel College|Western Maryland College]] (now known as McDaniel College). In a time before [[student athlete|eligibility limitations]], he played football at George Washington and Georgetown and ran track at Western Maryland.<ref name=cole/> At Georgetown in 1909, he was called the first [[quarterback]] in the East to master the [[forward pass]], several years before [[Gus Dorais]] of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] did so in 1913.<ref name=baltfb>Ted Patterson and Edwin H. Remsberg, [http://books.google.com/books?id=cZeye8iTWyMC ''Football in Baltimore: History and Memorabilia''], p. 41, JHU Press, 2000, ISBN 0-8018-6424-0.</ref><ref>[http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/fb-time.htm Georgetown Football Timeline], Hoya Saxa, retrieved March 21, 2009.</ref> According to ''The Georgetown Hoyas: A Story of A Rambunctious Football Team'', Dorais's "end-over-end [[discus throw|'discus' throw]] was an exact copy" of Byrd's passing technique, and the Irish "got the headlines because they had a press agent and Georgetown didn't."<ref>Morris Allison Bealle, [http://books.google.com/books?id=gGJLAAAAYAAJ ''The Georgetown Hoyas: A Story of A Rambunctious Football Team''], p. 75, Columbia Pub. Co., 1947.</ref>

Byrd also played for Maryland-based semi-professional baseball teams while pursuing his graduate studies.<ref name=somerset/> In 1910, the [[Chicago White Sox]] signed Byrd, but he was soon traded to the [[San Francisco Seals]],<ref name=somerset/> a semi-professional [[Pacific Coast League]] baseball team with whom he pitched in 1912.<ref name=papers/> He returned to Maryland later that year, and in 1913, married Katherine Dunlop Turnbull.<ref name=papers/> Before they divorced twenty years later, the couple had three sons and a daughter: Harry, Sterling, William, and Evelyn.<ref name=papers/>

In 1911, injuries claimed enough Maryland Agricultural football players that the team could no longer field a practice squad to scrimmage against.<ref name=ungrady/> The college turned to Byrd, who was serving as coach at [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts|Western High School]] in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]], and he was willing to help his alma mater with scrimmages.<ref name=ungrady/> Byrd later replaced head coach [[Charley Donnelly]], who resigned mid-season after accumulating a 2&ndash;4&ndash;2 record.<ref>[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=620&year=1911 1911], College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved October 9, 2011.</ref> Byrd led the Aggies to wins in both of their final games of the season, against Western Maryland, 6&ndash;0, and [[Gallaudet University#Football|Gallaudet]], 6&ndash;2.<ref name=ungrady>David Ungrady, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=kty1Jvi1j0IC Tales from the Maryland Terrapins]'', pp. 18&ndash;20, Sports Publishing LLC, 2003, ISBN 1-58261-688-4.</ref>

In 1913, the Maryland Agricultural College hired Byrd as an instructor in English and history,<ref name=papers/> and he was named the head coach of the track and [[Maryland Terrapins baseball|baseball team]]s, the latter of which he coached through 1923.<ref>''2009 Maryland Baseball Media Guide'', p. 25, University of Maryland, 2009.</ref> According to author David Ungrady in ''Tales from the Maryland Terrapins'', the university initially offered Byrd $300 to coach football, but he demanded $1,200.<ref name=ungrady/> The two parties came to agree upon that salary for all of his coaching and teaching duties which spanned nine months of the year.<ref name=ungrady/> Byrd also worked as a sportswriter for ''[[The Washington Star]]'',<ref name=papers/> a job he held until 1932.<ref name=ungrady/>

As football coach, he developed a unique offensive scheme called the "Byrd system", which combined elements of the [[single wing formation|single-wing]] and [[double-wing formation]]s.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=paMLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3749,1827637&dq=roy-mackert+|+charles-mackert+|+charles-l-mackert Old Liners Need New Backfield This Season], ''[[The Evening Independent]]'', August 30, 1935.</ref> One of Byrd's track and football players, [[Geary Eppley]], said, "He never yelled in practice or at a game&nbsp;... He pointed out mistakes and explained what you did wrong. He took a calm approach. The strongest thing he'd say was 'for cripes sake.'"<ref name=ungrady/>

In 1915, his duties were expanded to include those of [[athletic director]].<ref name=papers/> That same year, he requested funds for the construction of the campus's [[Old Byrd Stadium|first dedicated football stadium]], which was named in his honor.<ref>Ungrady, p. 24.</ref> During his tenure as head football coach from [[Maryland Terrapins football: 1856<U+2013>1946|1911 to 1934]], he compiled a 119&ndash;82&ndash;15 record.<ref name=cfbdw>[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=298 All-Time Coach Records by Year: Curley Byrd], College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved July 4, 2010.</ref>

==Administrative career==
[[File:Univ of Maryland campus 1938.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The University of Maryland campus as it appeared in 1938 before the dramatic expansion engineered by President Byrd]]
Byrd was appointed to the post of assistant university president in 1918.<ref name=papers/> He became a proponent of unification of the Maryland Agricultural College and the [[Baltimore]] professional schools into a single public University of Maryland,<ref name=papers/> and he was instrumental in what became the Consolidation Act of 1920.<ref name=papers/> Byrd named the student newspaper ''[[The Diamondback]]'' in 1921, and in 1933, he was the lead advocate for the adoption of the [[diamondback terrapin]] as the university's [[University of Maryland#Athletics|official nickname]] and [[University of Maryland#Testudo|mascot]].<ref name=papers/>

In 1932, Byrd was promoted to vice president of the university.<ref name=papers/> In July 1935, he was named the acting [[President of the University of Maryland, College Park|president of the university]],<ref name=papers/> and was officially appointed to the presidency in February 1936.<ref name=papers/> During his tenure, the budget, facilities, faculty, and enrollment increased significantly.<ref name=papers/> The school budget was increased and the campus expanded largely due to Byrd's deft political maneuvering in [[Annapolis]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. The school also saw a large growth in enrollment, due in part to returning veterans making use of the [[G.I. Bill]] after [[World War II]].<ref name=hofstadter>David Scott Brown, [http://books.google.com/books?id=y3Dv0GUqMPkC ''Richard Hofstadter: an Intellectual Biography''], p. 37, University of Chicago Press, 2006, ISBN 0-226-07640-7.</ref><ref>C.

Byrd was a staunch supporter of a "[[separate but equal]]" state university system. The [[University of Maryland Eastern Shore|Princess Anne campus]] provided agricultural education and [[Morgan State University|Morgan State College]] provided liberal arts education for the state's black students, while the University of Maryland remained open only to white students.<ref name=umes/> In 1951, Governor [[Theodore McKeldin]] criticized the University of Maryland as an example of wasteful state spending,<ref name=umes/> and was especially critical of expansions to the Princess Anne campus, which was geographically disconnected from the state's black population and not attracting many students to study agriculture.<ref name=umes/> Contractors had begun projects at the college before approval from the public works board, which was described as a usual practice under Byrd.<ref name=umes/> Byrd acceded to McKeldin and secured approval from the board for both the Princess Anne expansions as well as a sizable increase to the university budget.<ref name=umes>Theodore F. Scheckels, [http://books.google.com/books?id=rpokel6jHvMC ''Maryland Politics and Political Communication, 1950&ndash;2005''], pp. 150&ndash;151, Lexington Books, 2006, ISBN 0-7391-1415-8.</ref>

In 1945, Byrd hired 32-year old [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]] to his first head coaching post. Bryant led the Terrapins to a 6&ndash;2&ndash;1 record, but the two personalities clashed.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952802-4,00.html Football's Supercoach], ''Time'', September 29, 1980.</ref> The tensions came to a head when Byrd reinstated a player Bryant had suspended for violating team rules.<ref name=bryant>Al Browning, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wR-HNCyR6e0C ''I Remember Paul "Bear" Bryant: Personal Memoires of College Football's Most Legendary Coach, as Told by the People Who Knew Him Best''], pp. 100-101, Cumberland House Publishing, ISBN 1-58182-159-X.</ref> Bryant resigned as head coach an hour later, which caused an uproar among students until he interceded to restore order.<ref>Browning, p. 205.</ref>

Two years later, Byrd hired [[Jim Tatum]] as football coach. The [[1946 Oklahoma Sooners football team|year prior]] at [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], Tatum fielded a winning team, but the athletic department ran up a huge deficit and some players were paid in violation of [[Big Six Conference|conference]] rules,<ref name=tatum>Gary King, [http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/spring08/story.asp?ID=284 The Forgotten Man of Oklahoma Football: Jim Tatum; "Jim Tatum was a con-man, a dictator, a tyrant and one hell of a football coach." &ndash; Buddy Burris, All-American 1946, 1947 and 1948], ''Sooner Magazine'', University of Oklahoma Foundation, Inc., Spring 2008.</ref> which resulted in university president [[George Lynn Cross|George Cross]] firing athletic director [[Jap Haskell]].<ref name=bud/> The media blamed Tatum for his termination.<ref name=bud>Gary King, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ccLqJ6dQx4oC ''An Autumn Remembered: Bud Wilkinson's legendary '56 Sooners''], p. 38&ndash;40, University of Oklahoma Press, 2006, ISBN 0-8061-3786-X.</ref> Tatum told Cross to refute Tatum's role in the matter, and threatened to reveal the Oklahoma team had been paid $6,000 after the 1947 [[Gator Bowl]].<ref name=bud/> Cross asked Byrd to persuade Tatum not to go public, and according to author Gary King in ''An Autumn Remembered'', Byrd replied, "Persuade, hell! I'll tell him to keep his damn mouth shut!"<ref name=bud/> Tatum remained as coach at Maryland from 1947 to 1955, and amassed a 73<U+2013>15<U+2013>4 record.<ref name=thecoach/>

In 1948, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] passed a set of regulations called the Purity Code, later renamed the Sanity Code, which permitted student-athletes free tuition and meals, but required that part-time jobs be legitimate and their pay commensurate with the work.<ref name=price>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858594,00.html Sport: What Price Football?], ''Time'', January 23, 1950.</ref> Schools found to be in violation could be expelled from the NCAA.<ref name=price/> In 1950, seven schools, called the "Sinful Seven"&mdash;[[University of Virginia|Virginia]], Maryland, [[Virginia Military Institute|VMI]], [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]], [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], [[Boston College]], and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]&mdash;admitted they were in violation of the code.<ref name=price/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine asserted violators were far more widespread than those seven that had confessed.<ref name=price/> Maryland was the only Sinful Seven school that was also a major football power with eighty scholarship players, and Byrd led them in their stand against the Sanity Code.<ref name=spectacle>John Sayle Watterson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=KFDCUPCIU7kC ''College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy''], p. 214, JHU Press, 2002, ISBN 0-8018-7114-X.</ref> [[President of the University of Virginia|University of Virginia president]] [[Colgate Darden]] called the code hypocritical, and The Citadel's leadership refused to "lie to stay in the association" and requested termination of its NCAA membership.<ref name=price/> At the convention to decide Virginia's fate, Byrd said, "Does [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] want to vote for expulsion of Virginia, when Ohio State has facilities to take care of four or five as many athletes as Virginia?"<ref>Watterson, p. 217.</ref> The ensuing vote fell 25 short of the needed two-thirds majority to expel the Sinful Seven.<ref name=price/>

In 1951, the football team's 10&ndash;0 season culminated in a 28&ndash;13 victory over [[1951 Tennessee Volunteers football team|first-ranked Tennessee]] in the [[1952 Sugar Bowl]]. Maryland's participation, however, was in violation of a [[Southern Conference]] resolution passed mid-season that banned participation in postseason [[bowl game]]s. Byrd had Maryland accept the bowl invitation, despite Tatum's objections. The coach thought the threatened sanctions, which prevented Maryland from playing any Southern Conference games the [[1952 Maryland Terrapins football team|following season]], would severely disadvantage his team.<ref>Ungrady, pp. 77&ndash;78.</ref> In 1952, Maryland and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], which had also violated the bowl game ban, were sanctioned, and the incident hastened the break-up of the Southern Conference and formation of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], of which both schools were founding members.<ref>K.
