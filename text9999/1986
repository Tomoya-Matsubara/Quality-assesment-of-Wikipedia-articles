The '''National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (NAASP)''' is an American nonprofit [[suicide prevention]] organization coordinating national efforts to advance the [[National Strategy for Suicide Prevention]] (NSSP). It is a  public/private partnership that "catalyzes planning, implementation, and accountability for updating and advancing the NSSP.<ref> Suicide Prevention, United States [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], June 3, 2011.

Part of the NAASP's work is to identify [[culturally appropriate]] interventions to serve various minority populations. Clinical social worker Caitllin Ryan, whose work has been recognized by numerous organizations including the NAASP explains that these are "interventions that address multiple aspects of people's lives, such as ethnicity, culture, language, socioeconomic status and religious diversity in providing services ... [to meet people] where they are, to explain our findings and family approach in ways that cross language and cultural barriers."<ref>

In December 2011 NAASP partnered with [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), a branch of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] and [[Facebook]] to offer a new service to help offer suicide crisis worker access to users who were flagged by others for posting suicidal comment.<ref> Facebook Provides First-of-a-Kind Service To Help Prevent Suicides, ''Morning Zen'', December 14, 2011, Children's Mental Health Network.

==Mission==
The mission of the NAASP is to advance the 2001 National Stategy for Suicide Prevention by "identifying suicide prevention as a national priority, catalyzing efforts to implement high-priority objectives of the NSSP, and cultivating the sources needed to sustain progress."<ref>Bending the Curve on Suicide, Thomas Insell, August 01, 2011, National Institute of Mental Health. [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2011/bending-the-curve-on-suicide.shtml] </ref>

==Task forces==
Starting with the three minority groups identified at the formation of the NAASP, individual task forces have been set up within the group to forward the goals using culturally appropriate interventions. Additional task forces have been set up to coordinate overall goals and identify resources. Other tasks forces being considered include ones that focus on Latina teenagers and individuals with [[Disability|disabilities]].
===LGBT populations===
Although first focused on [[suicide of LGBT youth]], the LGBT ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]]) task force expanded to include LGBT of all ages "acknowledging the struggles with suicide idealization, suicide attempts, and death by suicide that many LGBT people confront at different points in their lives."<ref> National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Tackles LGBT Suicide, Kellan Baker and Josh Garcia, April 26, 2012, NAASP bloodspot.

===American Indian and Alaska Native===
The [[American Indian]] and [[Alaska Native]] task force has coordinated two national action summits (August 2011, in Scottsdale, Arizona and October 2011 in Anchorage, Alaska).<ref name=Yvette> Protecting Life in Indian Country, Yvette Roubideaux, JANUARY 31, 2012, NAASP. [http://actionallianceforsuicideprevention.blogspot.com/2012/01/protecting-life-in-indian-country.html]</ref> The task force is led by [[Yvette Roubideaux]], Director of Indian Health Service, [[United States Department of Health & Human Services]].<ref name=Yvette/>
:"The Summits focused on the importance of collaboration among tribal, federal, state, and community- and program-level leadership to promote American Indian and Alaska Native behavioral health."<ref name=Yvette/>

===Military and veterans===
The [[Military of the United States|Military]] and Veterans (see [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]) task force is co-chaired by Jan Kemp, VISN2 Center of Excellence for Suicide Prevention.<ref>VISN 2 Health Care Services: Behavioral VA Health Care News, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, November 1, 2011. [http://www.visn2.va.gov/VISN2/bh/news3q2011.asp] </ref> The task force will "join Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) suicide prevention programs already in progress. In doing so, suicide prevention programs aimed at military personnel will combine approaches from both public and private sectors into a single effort."<ref> Suicide Prevention Task Force Targets Military Personnel, January 7, 2011, posted to LaVan and Neidenberg (likely a press release reprint). [http://www.disabilitylawclaims.com/blog/suicide-prevention-task-force-targets-military-personnel.cfm]</ref>

===Other===
At least three other task forces have been started by the NAASP, Data and Surveillance, Research, and National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.

==Executive committee==
The initial executive committee was nominated by the general public and reviewed by "a nominating committee comprised of public sector and private sector suicide prevention leaders."<ref name=Howchosen> How are the Executive Committee and Task Force Members Chosen? National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, Jan 14, 2011. [http://www.actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/how-are-executive-committee-and-task-force-members-chosen]</ref> Candidates were selected based on criteria including; do they bring a needed perspective to [[suicide prevention]], can they leverage change at the national level; and can they uniquely contribute to the Executive Committee? Since the September 2010 launch new candidates are reviewed by the nominating committee and finalized by the co<U+2010>chairs.<ref name=Howchosen/>
