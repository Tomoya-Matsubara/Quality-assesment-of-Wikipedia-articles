'''Skirbeck''' is a suburb and former [[civil parish]] in the [[Boston (borough)|Borough of Boston]] in the county of [[Lincolnshire]], England. Skirbeck is a long v-shaped formation wrapped around the south and east side of [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] parish. It has been incorporated into the Borough of Boston since 1932.<ref>{{cite web|title=Skirbeck Civil Parish|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10450822&c_id=10001043|work=Vision of Britain|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> Skirbeck includes the hamlet and former civil parish of '''Skirbeck Quarter''' which was on the west side of the river Witham and was a separate parish from 1866 to 1932.<ref>{{cite web|title=Skirbeck Quarter Civil Parish|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10450883|work=Vision of Britain|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref>

==History==
That name originates from the words "skirn" and "bekkr" meaning "clear stream".<ref>{{cite web|title=Skirbeck|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~aezins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=10215|work=Institute for Name Studies|publisher=Nottingham University|accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref> 
Skirbeck appears in two entries in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, when it was recorded as consisting of a total of 42 households and had two churches and two fisheries.<ref>{{OpenDomesday|OS=TF3343|name=skirbeck|display=Skirbeck|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 

St Leonards Hospital for ten poor people, was founded around 1220 and was held by the [[Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem]] from about 1230. It was later united with the Preceptory at [[Maltby Preceptory|Maltby]]. In 1542 it was granted to Charles [[Duke of Suffolk]], and may have continued as an [[almshouse]]. It appears to have been located on the west side of the Maud Foster Drain, opposite the present Hospital Bridge. An old house known as Jerusalem House may have been built of material from the hospital, however this has been disputed by the St Leonards Trust who believe the present bedehouses stand on the site of the original hospital.<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=353989|mname= St Leonards Hospital|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 

The parish church is set by the bank of the [[River Witham]], and is thought to predate the foundation of [[Boston Stump|St Botolph's Church]] in Boston. Dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]] it is a Grade II* [[listed building]] dating from the 13th century. It was restored between 1869 and 1875 by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]], and in 1899 a restoration of the western tower took place. Between 1933 and 1935 a [[chancel]] by LT Moore was added.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1388859|desc=Parish Church of St Nicholas |accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref>

The Grade II* listed Hussey Tower was a 14- and 15th-century brick tower with an octagonal turret, originally known as Benyington Tower. It was sold to Boston Corporation and dismantled after 1545 when it was forfeited by [[Lord Hussey]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1388981|desc=Hussey Tower|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 

Boston [[Workhouse]] was built in 1837 by George Gilbert Scott. It was built near the site of the [[medieval]] hospital of St John. The Grade II listed front range of the workhouse still exists, but the rear ranges were demolished in 1980.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1388982|desc=St Johns Buildings, Boston Workhouse|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 

Boston [[House of correction]] was in Skirbeck Quarter and was erected in 1809. From 1826 it was only used to hold prisoners for trial, and after 1837 Boston borough gaol became available and Skirbeck House of correction closed. In 1849 it was converted into a [[Prison cell|lock-up]].<ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=1133287|mname= County House of Correction|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 

[[Holy Trinity]] Grade II listed church in Skirbeck Quarter, which was a [[chapel of ease]] to Skirbeck, was built 1846<U+2013>48 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. In 1988 it was added to by John Webster of Leeds.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1389023|desc=Church of the Holy Trinity|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite PastScape|mnumber=1133287|mname= Skirbeck Quarter|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 

[[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] Church in Skirbeck Quarter started as a classroom of the original school building in 1866, and in 1885 became a "tin tabernacle". Need for a permanent brick building was recognised and the church was begun in 1909 and completed in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|title=St Thomas Church|url=http://www.parish-of-boston.org.uk/st-thomas.htm|work=Boston Parish|publisher=Parish of Boston|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> It was built by [[Temple Moore]] and is a Grade II listed building.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1388920|desc=Church of St Thomas |accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref>
