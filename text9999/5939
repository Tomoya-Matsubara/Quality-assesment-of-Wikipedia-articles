The '''Nieuport Nie 31'''  or '''Nieuport 31''' was a single engine, single seat [[monoplane]] or [[sesquiplane]] [[fighter aircraft]] designed and built in [[France]] in 1919.  
==Design and development==
Though the Nie 31 (it had been flown and subsequently abandoned well before the company changed its name to Nieuport-Delage) was technically a [[sesquiplane]], it could equally well be described as a [[shoulder wing]] [[monoplane]] with a small [[foreplane]]. Its immediate predecessor was the [[Nieuport monoplane]] of 1917, which had an ancillary lifting surface built around the axle of its wide track undercarriage.  The Nie 31 had a narrower track undercarriage but the second wing extended outwards beyond the wheels, which were [[aircraft fairing|faired]] into its upper surface; this wing and the axle were joined to the lower [[fuselage]] by a pair of near vertical N-form [[strut]]s.<ref name=G&S/>

The main plane was of low [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]].  In plan it had a rounded [[leading edge]], straight [[trailing edge]] and square tips.  Its roots were cut away to allow a better downward view from the [[cockpit]]. This was placed ahead of the trailing edge so the pilot looked forward over the wing; he had a faired headrest behind. The Nie 31's upper wing had [[aileron]]s but no [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s and was braced on each side by a parallel pair of [[aerofoil]] section struts stretching outwards from the bottom of the undercarriage struts.  The lower wing had parallel chord and straight edges, providing a lifting surface with about 40% the area of the main plane.  Both wings were [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covered]].<ref name=G&S/>

The Nie 31 was powered by a {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on|0|disp=flip}} [[Le Rhone 9]]R nine cylinder [[rotary engine]], smoothly and completely [[aircraft fairing#Types|cowled]]. It drove a two blade [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]].  The fuselage, like that of the earlier [[Nieuport 29|Nieuport Nie 29]], was a smooth wooden [[monocoque]] shell of [[tulipwood]], produced by winding thin spiral strips around a mould in a series of alternately-handed layers and glueing them together.  It tapered to the rear, where an almost delta shaped [[tailplane]] was mounted at mid-height, carrying [[balanced rudder|horn balanced]] [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]]. The [[fin]] was much less broad, with a straight edged, balanced [[rudder]] extending down between the elevators below the lower fuselage, where there was a small [[dorsal]] fin.<ref name=G&S/> 

The Nie 31 was intended to carry twin 7.7&nbsp;mm (0.303&nbsp;in) [[Vickers]] [[machine guns]]. A flight test programme conducted through 1919 showed that the Nie 31 had excellent performance, especially given the low engine power, but Nieuport decided not to proceed with its development.<ref name=G&S/>
