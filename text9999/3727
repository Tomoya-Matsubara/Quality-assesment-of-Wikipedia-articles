== Dr. Mishra's Support for Mithila state==
Deeply devoted to the cause of his mother tongue, Maithili like many other [[Maithil]]s,initially Dr. Mishra was reluctant for the statehood of Mithila but at his Allahabad residence on 20.11.1994 in a meeting with Dr. Dhanakar Thakur, founder of the Antarrashtriy Maithili Parishad he became convinced that [[Maithili]] language was insecure in [[Bihar]] state and and that there was an urgent need for the creation of [[Mithila]] state in India carving out the Maihtili speaking territry of Bihar (and later some parts from Jharkhand when that state came into existence in 2000) and they both initially  toured interiors of Mithila  togather in December 1994 ( Supaul,Forbesganj, Jogbani, Purnea, Bhagalpur etc.) with the motto for creation of Mithila state, a home for [[Maithili]] speaking community, and the Mithila Rajya Sangharsh Samiti, a unit of the Antarrashtriy Maithili Parishad (NOT Akhil Bhartiya Mithila Rajya Sangharsh Samiti) was formed on January 8, 1995 at Patna where the representatives from all areas of Mithila had assembled. Later Dr. Mishra depite his old age and illness formally accepted its presidentship in the SECOND INTERNATIONAL MAITHILI CONFERENCE at Madhubani on Jauary 8th 1996 on which post he remained till his death (on Feb 3, 2009), touring the interiors of Mithila even with the implanted pacemaker.<ref>http://drdhanakarthakur.blogspot.in/2009/02/drjaykant-mishra-1209.html</ref> and presented a role model in the history of Mithila as that of old Rana Sanga and Veer Kuer Singh in the Indian History.
