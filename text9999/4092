The '''United States Institute of Peace Headquarters''' houses staff offices and other facilities for the government-funded [[think tank]] focused on peacemaking and conflict avoidance.  The building is the first permanent home for the [[United States Institute of Peace]] (USIP), established in 1984.  The headquarters is sited on a prominent location near the [[National Mall]] and [[Potomac River]] in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]  The environmentally friendly building, noted for its unique roof, was designed by architect [[Moshe Safdie]] and completed in 2011.  Critics' reviews of the building's design have been mixed.

==History==
In the 1980s, Democratic Senator [[Jennings Randolph]] of [[West Virginia]] led a group of lawmakers calling for a federal peace institute.<ref name=editorial>{{cite news | author=The Editorial Board | date=June 12, 2008 | title=Below the Radar: A Federal ''Peace'' Agency | url=http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/below-the-radar-a-federal-peace-agency/?_r=0 | newspaper=The New York Times | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  USIP was established by Congress in 1984 and for many years rented office space in various buildings in downtown Washington, the last being 1200 17th Street NW.<ref name=white>{{cite news | last=White | first=Suzanne | date=November 19, 2011 | title=Peace Institute prepares to `give blessing' to architects | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2001/11/19/newscolumn7.html?page=all | newspaper=Washington Business Journal | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  In 1996, Congress approved a site on the National Mall for USIP.<ref name=zongker>{{cite news | last=Zongker | first=Brett | date=June 13, 2007 | title=Giving Institute of Peace a chance | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/13/entertainment/et-institute13 | agency=Associated Press | publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  The site chosen for a new headquarters, the first permanent home for the USIP, was on the corner of 23rd Street and [[Constitution Avenue]] NW in Foggy Bottom.<ref name=white2>{{cite news | last=White | first=Suzanne | date=August 20, 2011 | title=Institute of Peace to build new HQ | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2001/08/20/story3.html?page=all | newspaper=Washington Business Journal | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=gustafson>{{cite news | last=Gustafson | first=Katherine | date=November 9, 2011 | title=Moshe Safdie Builds for Peace | url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2011/1109/design_1-1.html | newspaper=ArchitectureWeek | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  It was previously a parking lot for [[Bureau of Medicine and Surgery]] employees at the adjacent [[Old Naval Observatory]].

In 2004, Congress authorized $100 million for construction of USIP's headquarters, in part due to the efforts of Republican Senator [[Ted Stevens]] of [[Alaska]], while the institute was required to raise the remaining $86 million.<ref name=kennicott2>{{cite news | last=Kennicott | first=Philip | date=June 24, 2007 | title=Taking the Wrong View | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062200404.html | newspaper=The Washington Post | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=krouse>{{cite news | last=Krouse | first=Sarah | date=March 22, 2010 | title=U.S. Institute of Peace already in expansion mode | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/03/22/story1.html?page=all | newspaper=Washington Business Journal | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=abramowitz>{{cite news | last=Abramowitz | first=Michael | date=June 6, 2008 | title=At Peace Institute Groundbreaking, War Dominates the Proceedings | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/05/AR2008060502545.html | newspaper=The Washington Post | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  The funds raised by USIP included a $10 million donation from [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref name=zongker/>  Another corporate donor to the building fund, defense contractor [[Lockheed Martin]], was named a "Founding Corporate Partner" after donating $1 million.

In April 2001, USIP issued solicitations for a design and twenty-six architects submitted proposals.<ref name=white2/>  Moshe Safdie had never heard of USIP before receiving the design request, but he was one of the five finalists chosen.  The other four were [[Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects]], [[Michael Graves and Associates]], Polshek Partnership (now known as [[Ennead Architects]]), and [[Weiss/Manfredi]] (which withdrew).  According to USIP president [[Richard H. Solomon]], Safdie's design was chosen because the other designs "were basically square buildings."<ref name=raskin/>  USIP's headquarters is the second building in Washington, D.C. designed by Safdie.  The first was the fortress-like headquarters of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], completed in 2008, which dominates the busy intersection of [[Florida Avenue|Florida]] and [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenues]] NE.<ref name=kennicott/><ref name=kennicott2>{{cite news | last=Kennicott | first=Philip | date=September 12, 2010 | title=The architecture of the U.S. Institute of Peace on the mall | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/09/AR2010090907721.html | newspaper=The Washington Post | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>

The [[National Capital Planning Commission]] (NCPC) unanimously approved plans for the building in 2007.<ref name=zongker/>  The groundbreaking ceremony took place the following year in June.  Dignitaries in attendance included President [[George W. Bush]], Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]], Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], former Defense Secretary [[Frank Carlucci]], and former Secretaries of State [[Henry Kissinger]], [[George P. Shultz]], and [[Madeleine Albright]].  During the ceremony, some of the speakers hinted their opposing views of Bush's use of preventive war.<ref name=abramowitz/>  Construction of the {{convert|154000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} headquarters, which is [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certified, was carried out by Clark Construction Group of [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]].<ref name=krouse/><ref name=gustafson/>  The U.S. Green Building Council certified it as the first environmentally friendly building on the National Mall.<ref name=zongker/>  The headquarters, which is managed by real estate services firm Akridge, was dedicated in October 2011.<ref name=kennicott/><ref name=akridge>{{cite web | date=October 6, 2010 | url=http://www.akridge.com/whatsnew_pdfs/Akridge_USIP_PropMgmt_100610.pdf | title=United States Institute of Peace Selects Akridge to Manage Landmark Headquarters Building | publisher=Akridge | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  That same year, the Samuel W.

==Design==

According to Safdie, the building "is by definition the physical symbol of peace in the capital's skyline" and needed to convey the spirit of peace.<ref name=volume>{{cite book | author=Safdie, Moshe | title=Moshe Safdie: Volume 2 (Millennium) | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CT95kcB0LXcC&lpg=PT206&dq=%22Peace%20Institute%22%20headquarters&pg=PT206#v=onepage&q=Peace%20Institute&f=false | location=Mulgrave, Victoria | publisher=Images Publishing Group | page=17, 202 | date=2009 | isbn=9781864701630 | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  Safdie stated: "I'm not one who believes in overt symbolism, but my sense of a building dedicated to peace was a sense of the lightness of being,...It should be a serene building. It should not be an aggressive building. It should be full of light."<ref name=gustafson/>  Safdie achieved this by designing a glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] facing the Lincoln Memorial and a billowing glass ceiling.<ref name=raskin/>  The ceiling is one of the building elements in common with Safdie's design for the [[Yitzhak Rabin Center]] in Israel.<ref name=volume/>  The {{convert|8|in|cm}} thick roof is made of 1,482 white glass panels and supported by steel frames while the interior of the roof is covered by a translucent plastic film.<ref name=raskin/><ref name=gustafson/>  It is opaque and white during the day and glows at night.<ref name=strickland>{{cite news | last=Strickland | first=Carol | date=June 3, 2011 | title=Designing for dignity | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Arts/2011/0603/Designing-for-dignity | newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>

There are two main entrances to the building, one facing Constitution Avenue, and another facing 23rd Street NW.  The building is made of acid-etched precast-concrete and resembles [[limestone]].<ref name=gustafson/>  The design is centered around two [[Atrium (architecture)|atria]], a large one facing the National Mall that is designed for the public, and a smaller private one for staff that overlooks the Potomac River.<ref name=volume/>  The larger atrium, the George P. Shultz Great Hall, measures {{convert|11800|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and features the {{convert|80|ft|m|abbr=on}} high glass curtain wall facing the National Mall.  The 230-seat Frank C. Carlucci III Auditorium, Jacqueline and Marc Leland Atrium, and {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Global Peacebuilding Center, an interactive museum dedicated to peacemaking, are accessible via this atrium.  The roof over the Great Hall, designed to convey a [[Columbidae|dove]]'s wings, is called Ansary Peace Dove.  The second atrium, also known as the International Women<U+2019>s Commons, measures {{convert|3600|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and is lined with offices, a library, meeting rooms, conference center, and the Farooq Kathwari Amphitheatre.  The roof over this atrium is a simplified version of Ansary Peace Dove.  There is a {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} outdoor terrace and adjoining boardroom facing the Lincoln Memorial.<ref name=gustafson/><ref name=event>{{cite web | url=http://www.usip.org/hosting-event-usip | title=Hosting an Event at USIP | publisher=United States Institute of Peace | accessdate=November 2, 2014 }}</ref>  A three-story underground parking garage can accommodate 230 vehicles; 140 of those spaces are reserved for Navy personnel.<ref name=ncpc>{{cite web | date=June 7, 2007 | url=https://www.ncpc.gov/ncpc/Main%28T2%29/ProjectReview%28Tr2%29/CommissionArchive/CommissionActionsiframepages/Archive/2007/June2007.html | title=United States Institute of Peace Headquarters and Public Education Center  | publisher=National Capital Planning Commission | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>

==Reception==
Katherine Gustafson of ''[[ArchitectureWeek]]'' thought the building "succeeds as a monumental edifice befitting its place in the urban frame of the National Mall" while Nathan Guttman of ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' described the headquarters as an "architectural gem."<ref name=guttman/><ref name=gustafson/>  Architect Roger K. Lewis, professor emeritus of architecture at the [[University of Maryland]], had mixed feelings about the building.  He said it was "most visible and aesthetically enticing after dark", while its "unique, idiosyncratic form appears somewhat less enticing" during the day.<ref name=lewis>{{cite news | last=Lewis | first=Roger K. | date=February 24, 2012 | title=At U.S. Institute of Peace, building<U+2019>s provocative design doesn<U+2019>t entirely succeed | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/at-us-institute-of-peace-buildings-provocative-design-doesnt-entirely-succeed/2012/02/21/gIQADOxOYR_story.html | newspaper=The Washington Post | accessdate=November 3, 2014 }}</ref>  During the NCPC meeting in 2007 giving final approval to the building, a [[National Park Service]] representative said "This building will be a foreign object in the landscape of classical architecture of this city", criticizing the design compared to the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] buildings along Constitution Avenue.<ref name=kennicott2/>  The building is highly visible to commuters on [[Interstate 66]] as they enter the city, a fact lamented by [[Philip Kennicott]], Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for ''[[The Washington Post]]''.  In two scathing reviews of the headquarters, Kennicott said "If it were not for the roof, the building would be unexceptional, just another exercise in boxy architecture pierced by deadening rows of identical rectangular windows" and "The institute<U+2019>s design marks yet another low point in Safdie<U+2019>s long descent into repetitive corporate architecture."<ref name=kennicott/><ref name=kennicott2/>
