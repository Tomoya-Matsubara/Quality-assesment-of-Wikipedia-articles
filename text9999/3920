==Early life and education==
A native of [[Wichita, Kansas]], Gates attained the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) and is a recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the BSA.<ref name="desalista">{{cite web | author =  | year =  | url = http://members.cox.net/scouting179/Eagle%20Distinguished.htm | title = Distinguished Eagle Scouts | format = | work = | publisher = Troop & Pack 179 | accessdate = 2006-03-02}}</ref><ref name="honor">{{cite book | last = Townley | first = Alvin | authorlink = | coauthors = | origdate= [[2006-12-26]] |url= http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312366531| title = Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts  | publisher = St. Martin's Press| location = New York | pages =pp. 217-218| id = ISBN 0-312-36653-1 |accessdate= 2006-12-29}}</ref> He graduated from [[Wichita East High School]] in 1961, reportedly with straight A's. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/washington/19gates.html] Gates then won a scholarship to attend the [[College of William and Mary]] where he graduated in 1965 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in European history. At [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]], Gates was an active member and president of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] (the national service fraternity) Chapter and the [[Young Republicans]]; he was also the business manager for the ''[[William and Mary Review]],'' a literary and art magazine.<ref>Whitson, Brian. "[http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6992 Gates ('65) nominated as defense secretary]." ''[[College of William and Mary]].'' [[November 9]] [[2006]]. Retrieved on [[November 9]] [[2006]].</ref>  At his [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] graduation ceremony, Gates received the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award naming him the graduate that "has made the greatest contribution to his fellow man." [http://news.yahoo.com/s/usnews/20061110/ts_usnews/factsaboutrobertgates] [http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6992] Gates then went on to receive a [[master's degree]] in [[history]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in [[1966]], and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Russian and Soviet history from [[Georgetown University]] in [[1974]].  He received an [[L.H.D.]] (Doctor of Humane Letters) in 1998 from his alma mater, [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]].

==Intelligence career==
=== Positions ===
While at Indiana University, Gates was recruited to join the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].  However, the CIA offered no exemption from the draft during the [[Vietnam War]]. Gates spent 1967<U+2013>69 in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] as an officer in the [[Strategic Air Command]], before joining the CIA full-time as an intelligence analyst. During one posting, at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] in [[Missouri]], he delivered intelligence briefings to [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]] crews.<ref>Thomas Powers, [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/powers.htm "Who Won the Cold War?"], ''New York Review of Books'', Vol. 43, no. 11, [[June 20]], [[1996]].</ref>

Gates left the CIA in 1974 to serve on staff of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. He returned to the CIA in late 1979, serving briefly as the director of the Strategic Evaluation Center, Office of Strategic Research. He was named the Director of the DCI/DDCI Executive Staff in [[1981]], [[Deputy Director for Intelligence]] in 1982, and [[CIA Deputy Director|Deputy Director of Central Intelligence]] from [[April 18]] [[1986]] to [[March 20]] [[1989]].

=== Director of Central Intelligence ===
Gates was nominated to become the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (head of the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate would reject the nomination due to controversy about his role in the [[Iran-Contra Affair|Iran-Contra affair]].

Gates was Deputy [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]] from March until August of 1989, and was Assistant to the President and [[Deputy National Security Adviser]] from August 1989 until November 1991.

[[Image:Robert Gates CIA photo.jpg|thumb|right|Gates as Director of Central Intelligence.]]

Gates was nominated (for the second time) for the position of Director of Central Intelligence by President [[George H. W. Bush]] on [[May 14]] [[1991]], confirmed by the Senate on [[November 5]], and sworn in on [[November 6]], becoming the only career officer in the CIA's history (as of 2005) to rise from entry-level employee to Director.

Deputy Directors during his tenure were [[Richard J. Kerr]] (from [[November 6]] [[1991]] until [[March 2]] [[1992]]) and Adm. [[William O. Studeman]] (from [[April 9]] [[1992]] through the remainder of Dr. Gates' tenure). He served until 1993.

The final report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters, issued on August 4, 1993, said that Gates "was close to many figures who played significant roles in the Iran/contra affair and was in a position to have known of their activities. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment..." <ref>Lawrence E. Walsh, [http://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/ Final report of the independent counsel for Iran/Contra matters], August 4, 1993, and in particular Chapter 16, [http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_16.htm "Robert M. Gates"]</ref>



===Level of involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal===
Because of his senior status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who played significant roles in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] and was in a position to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the U.S. do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the democratically-elected [[Sandinista]] government <ref>Los Angeles Times, Nov. 25, 2006, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1125-04.htm last visited Nov. 26, 2006. </ref>. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment of Gates for his Iran-Contra activities or his responses to official inquiries. 

Gates was an early subject of Independent Counsel's investigation, but the investigation of Gates intensified in the spring of 1991 as part of a larger inquiry into the Iran/contra activities of CIA officials. This investigation received an additional impetus in May 1991, when President [[George H.W. Bush]] nominated Gates to be [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI). The chairman and vice chairman of the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) requested, in a letter to the Independent Counsel on [[May 15]] [[1991]], any information that would <U+201C>significantly bear on the fitness<U+201D> of Gates for the CIA post.

Gates consistently testified that he first heard on [[October 1]] [[1986]], from [[Charles E. Allen]], the national intelligence officer who was closest to the Iran initiative, that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the [[Contras]]. Other evidence proves, however, that Gates received a report on the diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr.<ref>GlobalSecurity.org.  [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/1993/walsh/chap_16.htm Iran-Contra Report, Chapter 16.]</ref> The issue was whether the Independent Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with Allen in October. 

[[Grand Jury]] secrecy rules hampered Independent Counsel's response. Nevertheless, in order to answer questions about Gates' prior testimony, Independent Counsel accelerated his investigation of Gates in the summer of 1991. This investigation was substantially completed by [[September 3]] [[1991]], at which time Independent Counsel determined that Gates' Iran-Contra activities and testimony did not warrant prosecution.

Independent Counsel made this decision subject to developments that could have warranted reopening his inquiry, including testimony by [[Clair E. George]], the CIA's former deputy director for operations. At the time Independent Counsel reached this decision, the possibility remained that George could have provided information warranting reconsideration of Gates's status in the investigation. George refused to cooperate with Independent Counsel and was indicted on [[September 19]] [[1991]]. George subpoenaed Gates to testify as a defense witness at George's first trial in the summer of 1992, but Gates was never called.

==Career after leaving the CIA==
===1993-1999 ===
After retiring from the CIA in [[1993]], Gates worked as an academic and lecturer. He evaluated student theses for the [[International Studies]] Program of the [[University of Washington]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}} He lectured at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana]], [[Louisiana State University|Louisiana State]], [[Oklahoma University|Oklahoma]], and the [[College of William and Mary]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Gates served as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Oklahoma International Programs Center and a trustee of the endowment fund for the College of William and Mary, his [[alma mater]], which in 1998 conferred upon him the [[honorary degree]] of [[Doctor of Humane Letters]].

In 1996, Gates' [[autobiography]], ''From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War,'' was published. Gates has also written numerous articles on government and foreign policy and has been a frequent contributor to the [[op-ed page]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>[http://newsarchives.tamu.edu/stories/99/073099-8.html Texas A&M press release], July 1999. </ref>
[[Image:Robertgates tamu.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gates at Texas A&M]]

=== Texas A&M ===	
Gates was the interim Dean of the [[George Bush School of Government and Public Service]] at [[Texas A&M University]] from 1999 to 2001. On [[August 1]] [[2002]], he became the 22nd President of Texas A&M. As the university president, Gates made significant progress in four key areas of the university's "Vision 2020" plan, a plan to become one of the top 10 public universities by the year [[2020]]. The four key areas include improving student diversity, increasing the size of the faculty, building new academic facilities, and enriching the undergraduate and graduate education experience.<ref name="Robert_Gates">"[http://www.tamu.edu/president/documents/GatesSpeech2005b.pdf Texas A&M Academic Convocation 2005]". ''President Robert M. Gates''.</ref> During his tenure, Gates encouraged the addition of 440 new faculty positions and a $300 million campus construction program, and saw dramatic increases in minority enrollment.

===Corporate boards ===
Gates has been a member of the board of trustees of [[Fidelity Investments]], and on the board of directors of [[NACCO Industries]], Inc., [[Brinker International]], Inc., [[Parker Drilling Company]], [[Science Applications International Corporation]], and [[VoteHere]], a technology company which seeks to provide cryptography and computer software security for the electronic election industry.<ref>Mark Lewellen-Biddle, [http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/voting_machines_gone_wild "Voting Machines Gone Wild!"], ''In These Times'', December 11, 2003</ref>. A White House spokeswoman has said Gates plans to sell all the stock he owns in individual companies and sever all ties with them if confirmed by the Senate [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/06/AR2006120600188.html].

=== Public service ===
Gates is a former president of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]].<ref>[http://www.nesa.org/about/organization.html NESA Organization Site]</ref>

In January 2004, Gates co-chaired a [[Council on Foreign Relations]] task force on U.S. relations towards Iran. Among the task force's primary recommendation was to directly engage Iran on a diplomatic level regarding Iranian nuclear technology.  Key points included a negotiated position that would allow Iran to develop its nuclear program in exchange for a commitment from Iran to use the program only for peaceful means. <ref>[http://www.cfr.org/publication/7194/iran.html ''Iran: Time for a New Approach''], final report of an independent task force, July 2004, Council of Foreign Relations Press</ref>

At the time of his nomination by President George W. Bush to the position of Secretary of Defense, Gates was also a member of the [[Iraq Study Group]], also called the Baker Commission, which was expected to issue its report in November 2006, following the mid-term election on November 7. He was replaced by former [[US Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Lawrence Eagleburger]].

===Declined appointment as Director of National Intelligence===
In February 2005, Gates wrote in a message posted on his school's website that "there seems to be a growing number of rumors in the media and around campus that I am leaving Texas A&M to become the new [[director of national intelligence]] ('Intelligence Czar') in [[Washington, D.C.]]" The message said that "To put the rumors to rest, I was indeed asked to take the position, wrestled with perhaps the most difficult <U+2014> and close <U+2014> decision of my life, and last week declined the position." 

Gates committed to remain as President of Texas A&M University through the summer of 2005; President [[George W. Bush]] offered the position of [[United States Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) to [[John Negroponte]], who accepted.<ref>{{cite news

|title=Bush names Negroponte intelligence chief

|date=[[February 18]] [[2005]]
|accessdate=2006-11-08}}</ref> 

Gates said in a 2005 discussion with the university's Academy for Future International Leaders that he had tentatively decided to accept the DNI position out of a sense of duty and had written an email that would be sent to students during the press conference to announce his decision, explaining that he was leaving to serve the U.S. once again.  Gates, however, took the weekend to consider what his final decision should be, and ultimately decided that he was unwilling to return to Washington, D.C. in any capacity simply because he "had nothing to look forward to in D.C. and plenty to look forward to at A&M."

==Secretary of Defense==
[[Image:Gatesswornin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gates being sworn in as Defense Secretary on December 18, 2006.]]

On [[November 8]] [[2006]], after the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm election]], President [[George W. Bush]] announced his intent to nominate Gates to succeed the resigning [[Donald Rumsfeld]] as U.S. Secretary of Defense.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/08/rumsfeld/index.html

Gates was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] [[Senate Armed Services Committee|Armed Services Committee]] on [[December 5]], [[2006]].  During his confirmation hearing on [[December 5]] [[2006]], Senator [[Carl Levin]] of Michigan asked Gates if he thought the United States was winning the war in Iraq, to which Gates responded: "No, sir." He then went on to say that he did not think the United States was losing the war either.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=2330

Several months after his appointment, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a series of articles beginning [[February 18]], [[2007]] that brought to the spotlight the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2007/02/21/LI2007022100671.html "The Other Walter Reed"].</ref>  As a result of the fallout from the incident, Gates announced the removal of [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Francis J. Harvey]], and later approved the removal of Army Surgeon General [[Kevin C. Kiley]].<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/03/12/kiley.retire/index.html</ref>

On May 30, 2007, Gates was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremony at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado.

On the morning of June 8, 2007 it was announced that Gates will replace the retiring Chairman of Joint Chiefs General Peter Pace. Gates has recommended Adm. Mike Mullen, the current chief of naval operations, to fill the position. <ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=nation_world&id=5378699 http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=nation_world&id=5378699]</ref>

==Criticism==
As deputy director and director of America's leading intelligence agency for many years, Gates and his CIA staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the Soviet Union. More particularly, Gates has been criticized for concocting evidence to show that the Soviet Union was stronger than it actually was, and also for repeatedly skewing intelligence to promote a particular worldview.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15627855/site/newsweek "Old Names, Old Scandals", ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[November 8]], [[2006]]</ref> Also, according to U.S. Senate transcripts, Gates, as deputy director of CIA, vouched for the comprehensiveness of a CIA memo presented to the Senate and President Reagan alleging that the Soviet Union played a role in the 1981 shooting of [[Pope John Paul II]]. However, a CIA internal review later denounced the memo as being skewed. <ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15627855/site/newsweek "Old Names, Old Scandals", ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[November 8]], [[2006]]</ref>
