==History==

===1969 to 2000===
Samsung Electric Industries was established as a subsidiary of [[Samsung Group]] in 19<!-- Do not change to 1938, Samsung was founded in 1938 but Samsung Electronics was not founded until 1969 as the reference states -->69 in [[Suwon]], South Korea.<ref name="Samsung">{{cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/corporateprofile/history06.html|title=History <U+2013> Corporate Profile <U+2013> About Samsung <U+2013> Samsung| publisher =[[Samsung]]|accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> Its early products were electronic and electrical appliances including televisions, calculators, refrigerators, air conditioners and washing machines. In 1970, Samsung Group established another subsidiary, Samsung-NEC, jointly with Japan's [[NEC|NEC Corporation]] to manufacture [[home appliances]] and [[Professional audiovisual industry|audiovisual devices]]. In 1974, the group expanded into the [[semiconductor]] business by acquiring Korea Semiconductor, one of the first chip-making facilities in the country at the time. The acquisition of Korea Telecommunications, an electronic switching system producer, was completed at the start of the next decade in 1980.

By 1981, Samsung Electric Industries had manufactured over 10 million [[Black-and-white#Media|black-and-white televisions]]. In February 1983, Samsung's founder, [[Lee Byung-chull]], made an announcement later dubbed the "Tokyo declaration," in which he declared that Samsung intended to become a [[DRAM]] (dynamic random access memory) vendor. One year later, Samsung became the third company in the world to develop a 64[[Kilobit|kb]] DRAM.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 1988, Samsung Electric Industries merged with Samsung Semiconductor & Communications to form Samsung Electronics.

Samsung Electronics launched its first mobile phone in 1988, in the South Korean market.<ref name=Michell1>{{cite book |title=Samsung Electronics: And the Struggle For Leadership of the Electronics Industry|first1=Tony|last1=Michell|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2010|isbn=047082266X, 9780470822661|page=153|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vgZim29J3awC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Samsung+Electronics:+And+the+Struggle+For+Leadership+of+the+Electronics+Industry+AuthorIty+Michell&source=bl&ots=KQmkVB2Lw9&sig=5BtGpchoAJ9-0RJwUYRwBQAiEBU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SARJUIGOK8Kk0QWFqYGYBg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Samsung%20Electronics%3A%20And%20the%20Struggle%20For%20Leadership%20of%20the%20Electronics%20Industry%20AuthorIty%20Michell&f=false}}</ref> Sales were initially poor and by the early 1990s Motorola held a market share of over 60 percent in the country's mobile phone market compared to just 10 percent for Samsung.<ref name=Michell1/> Samsung's mobile phone division also struggled with poor quality and inferior products until the mid-1990s and exit from the sector was a frequent topic of discussion within the company.<ref name=Michell1/>

Samsung Electronics acquired a 40 percent stake in AST Research, a United States-based personal computer maker, for US$378 million in February 1995.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/business/international-business-koreans-seen-buying-more-us-concerns.html|title=Koreans Seen Buying More U.S. Concerns|accessdate=6 September 2012|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 July 1995}}</ref>

In 1996, the company devised a plan to sponsor major sporting events, resulting in it becoming an official sponsor for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Nagano]], [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/161740/samsung-extends-sponsorship-of-olympic-games-until-2016|title= Samsung Extends Sponsorship of Olympic Games until 2016 |date=24 April 2007 |publisher = Sportbusiness }}</ref>

===2010 to present===
Despite consistent growth, Samsung, along with its chairman Lee Kun-hee, has developed a reputation for insecurity regarding its financial stability and the potential for future crises to arise. After returning from a temporary retirement period in March 2010, Kun-hee stated that "Samsung Electronics' future is not guaranteed because most of our flagship products will be obsolete in 10 years from now."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/worldbiz/archives/2010/03/25/2003468850|title= Lee Kun-hee Returns to Samsung |date=25 March 2010 |work= [[Taipei Times]]}}</ref>

Samsung has emphasized innovation in its management strategy since the early 2000s and it again highlighted innovation as part of core strategies when it announced the Vision 2020 in which the company set an ambitious goal of reaching $400 billion in annual revenues within ten years. In order to cement its leadership in the areas of memory chip and television production, the company has invested aggressively in research and development. The company has 24 research-and-development centers around the world.

In April 2011, Samsung Electronics sold its [[hard disk drive|HDD]] commercial operations to [[Seagate Technology]] for approximately US$1.4 billion. The payment was composed of 45.2 million Seagate shares (9.6 percent of shares), worth US$687.5 million, and a cash sum for the remainder.<ref>[http://www.naholaw.com/samsung-seagate-hdd-unit-sell-for-1400000000-reuters/].</ref>

In the first quarter of 2012, the company became the highest-selling mobile phone company when it overtook Nokia, selling 93.5 million units compared to Nokia's 82.7 million units. Samsung also became the largest smartphone vendor as a result of strong sales of its Galaxy SII and Galaxy Note devices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/27/samsung-may-have-just-become-the-king-of-mobile-handsets-while-sp-downgrades-nokia-to-junk/ |title=Samsung May Have Just Become The King of Mobile Handsets, While S&P Downgrades Nokia To Junk |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref>

Samsung Electronics has been the world's-largest memory chip maker since 1993. In 2009 it started mass-producing 30&nbsp;nm-class NAND flash memories.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/memory/display/20100129100308_Samsung_Remains_Top_DRAM_Maker_Amid_Dramatic_Market_Growth.html |title= Samsung Remains Top DRAM Maker Amid Dramatic Market Growth |date= 9 January 2010 |publisher= Dow Jones }}</ref> It succeeded in 2010 in mass-producing 30&nbsp;nm-class DRAMs and 20&nbsp;nm-class NAND flashes, both of which were the first time in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.semiconductorpackagingnews.com/articles/article_22008.shtml |title= Samsung Develops Most Advanced Green DDR3 DRAM |date= 3 February 2010 |publisher=Semiconductor Packaging News }}</ref>

According to market-research firm Gartner, during the second quarter of 2010 Samsung Electronics took the top position in the DRAM segment due to brisk sales of the item on the world market. Gartner analysts said in their report, "Samsung cemented its leading position by taking a 35-percent market share. All the other suppliers had minimal change in their shares." The company took the top slot in the ranking, followed by Hynix, Elpida, and Micron, said Gartner.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4206013/Samsung-extends-lead-in-DRAM-rankings-semiconductor |title= Samsung Extends Lead in DRAM Rankings |date= 9 August 2010 |work = [[EE Times]] }}</ref>

Another hitherto not-well-publicized area where the company had significant business in for years is the [[Foundry model|foundry]] segment. It had begun investment in the foundry business since 2006 and now positioned it as one of the strategic pillars for semiconductor growth.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/HONSHI/20100727/184604/?P=2 |title= "We Wouldn't Launch a New Business Unless We Knew We Could Win"---Jeong-ki (Jay) Min |date= August 2010 |publisher= Samsung<U+65E5> NE Asia }}</ref>

Market researcher IC Insights has predicted that Samsung will become the world's-biggest semiconductor chip supplier by 2014 when it surpasses Intel. For the ten-year period from 1999 to 2009, Samsung's compound annual growth rate in semiconductor revenues has been 13.5 percent, compared with 3.4 percent for Intel.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2010/08/26/49337/samsung-to-overtake-intel-as-no.1-chip-company-in-2014.htm |title= Samsung To Overtake Intel as No. 1 Chip Company in 2014 |date= 26 August 2010 |publisher= Electronics Weekly/EE Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2010/07/30/49185/top-20-semi-manufacturers-from-ic-insghts.htm |title= Top 20 Semi Manufacturers from IC Insights |date= 30 July 2010 |publisher= Electronics Weekly/EE Times }}</ref>

Samsung sold more than one million 3D televisions within six months of its launch. This is the figure close to what many market researchers forecast for the year's worldwide 3D television sales (1.23 million units).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2010&no=470126|title= Samsung 3D TV Sells More Than 1 Million Units |date= 31 August 2010 |publisher= MK Business News }}</ref> It also debuted the 3D Home Theater (HT-C6950W) that allows the user to enjoy 3D image and surround sound at the same time.

Samsung later developed "Smart LED TV" (now renamed to "Samsung [[Smart TV]]"<ref>[http://www.samsung.com/us/article/the-wonder-of-samsung-smart-tvs "The Wonder of Samsung Smart TVs"].</ref>), which additionally supports downloaded [[Application software|apps]]. In 2008, the company launched the Power Infolink service, followed in 2009 by a whole new Internet@TV. In 2010, it started marketing the 3D television while unveiling the upgraded Internet@TV 2010, which offers free (or for-fee) download of applications from its Samsung Apps store, in addition to existing services such as news, weather, stock market, YouTube videos, and movies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/news/newsRead.do?news_seq=16458&page=1 |title=Samsung Unveils First Ever Application Store |publisher=Samsung|date=7 January 2010}}</ref>

Samsung Apps offers for-fee premium services in a few countries including Korea and the United States. The services will be custom-tailored for each region. Samsung plans to offer family-oriented applications such as health care programs and digital picture frames as well as games. Samsung's range of Smart TVs have many exclusive apps which can't be found on any other Smart TV such as [[ITV Player]] and motion controlled [[Angry Birds]].

==Management and board of directors==
In December 2010, Samsung switched its management system from the single CEO system of last year under Choi Gee-Sung, to a two-person management team with Choi Gee-Sung, CEO and Vice chairman, and Lee Jae-Yong, Chief Operating officer and President. In June 2012, Samsung appointed Kwon Oh-hyun as the new CEO of the company.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/news/hardware/Samsung-names-Kwon-Oh-hyun-as-new-CEO/articleshow/13895844.cms | title=Samsung names Kwon Oh-hyun as new CEO| date=7 June 2012 | work=The Times of India}}</ref> The team was credited as being younger both in age and in outlook, and in keeping with the new focus on youthfulness in spirit, some executives have even dyed their hair black.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2011/01/123_79783.html |title= Samsung Executives Dyeing Hair Black |date= 16 January 2011}}</ref>  Samsung also reorganized its overseas marketing bases in line with changes in the market, including a combined Britain/Continental Europe regional subsidiary, and a combined China/Taiwan regional subsidiary.

The company added a new digital imaging business division in 2010, and now consists of eight divisions, including the existing display, IT solutions, consumer electronics, wireless, networking, semiconductor, and LCD divisions.

==Design==
In the early 1990s, the firm began emphasizing the importance of design in its products. Located in the company's high-rise headquarters in Gangnam (south of Seoul) the corporate design center includes more than 900 full-time designers. In the beginning, there were only two designers in the whole company, whose number rose to 510 in 2005.

The company overhauls its design over a two-year cycle. For the first year, it scrutinizes all the design trends of the world, followed by product strategies. It then maps out new design plans during the second year.

Its effort to improve design paid off:  since 2006, it has won as many as 210 awards from internationally prestigious design institutions. For example, it received the iF (International Forum) and IDEA design awards. Samsung was the winner in eight categories in the 2009 IDEA awards, the company that received the most awards.

There is compelling reason for the company's rise as a design powerhouse. Korea had for so long been considered a backwater for design excellence, especially compared to the Japanese counterparts famous for churning out eye-catching gadgets. The company established as many as seven design centers in the world's major cities including Milan and London, as well as in Seoul. The professional designers working in these centers constantly monitor latest design trends in their cities while scanning cultural and lifestyle changes.

In the 2010 iF Material Awards, the company won the Gold Award for five of its products including the external hard disk drive. The iF Material Awards are given by the International Forum Design GmbH of Hannover, one of the world's-most- prestigious design awards for design materials and process technologies. In 2010, the German company selected a total of 42 products in the areas of home appliance, furniture, and industrial design. Samsung won the awards in five categories including external hard disk, full-touch screen phone, "side-by-side" refrigerator, compact digital camera, and laser printer toner.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2919659|title= Samsung Products Win iF Awards | date= 26 April 2010 |publisher= JoongAng Daily }}</ref>

==Environmental record==
All Samsung mobile phones and MP3 players introduced on the market after April 2010 are free from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/sustainability/environment/chemicalmanagement/policyontargetsubstances.html |title=Policy on target substances <U+2013> Chemical Management <U+2013> Environment <U+2013> Sustainability <U+2013> About Samsung <U+2013> Samsung|publisher=Samsung Electronics|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

The company is listed in [[Greenpeace]]'s Guide to Greener Electronics, which rates electronics companies on policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. In November 2011 Samsung was ranked 7th out of 15 leading electronics makers with a score of 4.1/10.<ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics <U+2013> Greenpeace International|accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> In the newly re-launched guide Samsung moved down two places (occupying 5th position in October 2010) but scored maximum points for providing verified data and its greenhouse gas emissions and also scored well for its Sustainable Operations with the guide praising its relatively good e-waste take-back programme and information. However, the company was criticized for not setting an ambitious target to increase its use of renewable energy and for belonging to a trade association which has commented against energy efficiency standards.<ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics"/>

In June 2004, Samsung was the first major electronics company to publicly commit to eliminate PVC and BFRs from new models of all its products. The company however failed to meet its deadlines to be PVC- and BFRs-free, and has published new phase out dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/sustainability/environment/chemicalmanagement/managementoftargetsubstances.html |title=Management of target substances <U+2013> Chemical Management <U+2013> Environment <U+2013> Sustainability <U+2013> About Samsung <U+2013> Samsung|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> Greenpeace activists protested at the company's [[Benelux]] headquarters in March 2010 for what Greenpeace calls Samsung's broken promises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/calling-out-samsung-030310/ |title=Calling out Samsung for toxic failure <U+2013> Greenpeace International|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

The company has been taking the lead in industry efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company has been awarded as one of global top-ten companies in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI).  It was the only Asian company among top-ten companies. In addition, the company is listed in [[Dow Jones Sustainability Index]] (DJSI).<ref name="greener">{{cite web|url=http://www.biztechreport.com/story/767-whos-greener-samsung-or-lg

The company's achievement ratio of products approaching the Global Ecolabel level ("Good Eco-Products" within the company) is 11 percentage points above the 2010 goal (80 percent). As of the first half of 2010, Samsung earned the Global Ecolabel for its 2,134 models, thereby becoming the world's number-one company in terms of the number of products meeting Global Ecolabel standards.<ref name="greener" />

The company is also accelerating its effort to recover and recycle electronic wastes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyenergyreport.com/2012/03/samsung-sustainability-initiatives-whats-working |title= Samsung Sustainability Initiatives: What<U+2019>s Working? | work = [[The Daily Energy Report]] |accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref> The amount of wastes salvaged throughout 60 countries during 2009 was as much as 240,000 tons.

In 2008, the company was praised for its recycling effort by the U.S. advocacy group Electronics Take Back Coalition as the "best eco-friendly recycling program".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/sustainability/environment/chemicalmanagement/policyontargetsubstances.html |title=Enviros Applaud Samsung for New Free National Recycling Program |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |accessdate=8 September 2008}}</ref>

==Controversies==
From 1999 to 2002, the company conspired with [[Hynix Semiconductor]], [[Infineon Technologies]], [[Elpida Memory]] ([[Hitachi]] and [[NEC]]) and [[Micron Technology]] to fix the prices of [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] chips sold to American computer makers. In 2005 Samsung agreed to plead guilty and to pay a $300 million fine, the second-largest criminal antitrust fine in US history.<ref name="U.S. Department of Justice"/><ref name="Pimentel"/><ref name="Price-Fixing Costs Samsung $300M"/> Three Samsung executives agreed to plead guilty and serve several months in prison.<ref name="Flynn"/>

In May 2010, the EU antitrust watchdog levied a <U+20AC>145.73 million fine against Samsung for the same DRAM cartel.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/19/eu-chipmakers-idUSLDE64I20420100519 | publisher = [[Reuters]] | title= Corrected{{spaced ndash}} Update 1-EU Fines Samsung Elec, Others for Chip Price-Fixing | date=19 May 2010}}</ref>

In December 2010, the [[European Commission]] fined six LCD panel producers, including Samsung, a total of <U+20AC>648.925 million for operating a cartel.
