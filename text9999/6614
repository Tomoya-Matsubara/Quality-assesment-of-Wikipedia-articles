{{Anti-war}}
'''Katie Sierra''' (born 1986) is an [[United States|American]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Peace activist|anti-war activist]] who was controversially [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] from [[high school]] in October 2001 for opposing the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|bombing of Afghanistan]].<ref name=fuentes>{{cite journal |authorlink=Annette Fuentes |last=Fuentes |first=Annette |date=[[2004-06-30]] |title=Whose Homeland Is It? |journal=[[In These Times]] |publisher=Institute For Public Affairs |url=http://www.alternet.org/rights/19111/?page=2 |accessdate= 2008-03-22 |quote= }}</ref> At the age of 15, she was engaged in anti-war activism at her school, [[Sissonville High School]] near [[Charleston, West Virginia]], wearing clothes with handwritten messages objecting to perceived U.S. militarism, racism, sexism and homophobia. When she applied for permission to start an anarchist club at the school, she was denied by the school's principal, and attempts at publicizing the club led to her being suspended from school for three days. Incendiary comments by the principal and the members of the school's board of education were reported in the press and provoked a controversy that garnered national and international media attention.

After verbal and physical assaults by Sierra's fellow students, her mother withdrew her from the school and, with the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], they initiated legal action against her headmaster and the school board. Initially unsuccessful and subject to various setbacks, these efforts eventually succeeded in overturning the school's decision not to allow the club, although the propriety of other actions by the school was upheld. Sierra briefly returned to Sissonville High in August 2002 before again withdrawing over peer harassment after less than a week. The actions and attitude of the school toward Sierra were sharply criticized in the media for what critics perceived as [[censorship]] and [[McCarthyism]], as a dark sign of post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]] American society and its conception of [[freedom of speech]]. Sierra later went on to study at [[Marshall University]] in [[West Virginia]].

==Biography==
===Background and suspension===
Sierra was born into a military family; her father fought in the [[Vietnam War]] and was later a civilian employee of the military, in which two of her brothers also served.<ref name=wvn>{{cite news |title=Student files lawsuit over anarchy club |url=http://wvanews.com/10-31/WVAnarchyLawsuitM0018.html |archivedate=2001-12-10 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011210112647/http://wvanews.com/10-31/WVAnarchyLawsuitM0018.html |work=West Virginia News/[[Associated Press]] |date=[[2001-10-31]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> During Sierra's childhood, her family moved around frequently; prior to attending [[Sissonville High School]] in [[Pocatalico, West Virginia]] (a community near [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]), she had attended eleven schools and lived in [[Panama]], [[New Mexico]], [[Ohio]] and [[Kentucky]].<ref name=pretty>{{cite journal |last=Bissett |first=Jim |year= |month= |title=Democracy isn't always pretty |journal=[[The Dominion Post (Morgantown)|The Dominion Post]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= 2008-03-22 |quote= }}</ref><ref name=teenarchist>{{cite news |title=Teen anarchist sues school principal  |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/taped/sierra/background_ctv.html |work=[[Court TV]] |publisher=Courtroom Television Network LLC. |date=[[2002-09-17]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> Although described as a "good student with no history of behavioral problems",<ref name=teenarchist/> she soon became embroiled in a controversy at the Charleston-area high school. On [[October 23]] [[2001]] Sierra asked the school's [[principal (school)|principal]], Forrest Mann, if she could start an [[anarchism|anarchist]] club at the school, after reading about the subject on [[Infoshop.org]].<ref name=infoshop/> Among the possible club activities she mentioned were [[Book discussion club|reading]] and [[discussion group]]s and [[community service]], while flyers for the club also proposed starting a [[zine]] (called the ''Anny''<ref name=infoshop/>) and a chapter of [[Food Not Bombs]], a hunger charity. The club's [[manifesto]] declared "[t]his anarchist club will not tolerate hate or violence<U+2026>It is our final goal to dispel myths about anarchism, especially the belief that anarchy is [[chaos]] and destruction".<ref name=teenarchist/> Without reading Sierra's literature, Mann refused to grant permission for such a club in the school, and according to Sierra had to ask her several times to return to class when he would not explain his decision.<ref name=teenarchist/>

Sierra attended class wearing t-shirts with handwritten political slogans, a practice she claimed to have adopted long before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]: among the messages written on the t-shirts were "Against [[George W. Bush|Bush]], Against [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]]" and "When I saw the dead and dying Afghani children on TV, I felt a newly recovered sense of national security. God bless America."<ref name=monbiot>{{cite journal |last=Monbiot |first=George |authorlink=George Monbiot |date=[[2001-12-18]] |title=The Taliban of the west |journal=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/dec/18/september11.uk |accessdate= 2008-03-22 }}</ref> Reading the back of Sierra's t-shirt, fellow student and aspirant [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Jacob Reed allegedly told her, "If you don't like this country, then fucking leave", and subsequently received [[School punishment#Detention|detention]].<ref name=teenarchist/> The day of the incident, Mann summoned Sierra to his office and told her she would no longer be allowed to wear the shirts, and claimed that Sierra had violated his prior orders by making flyers for the club available to other students. Mann [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] her for three days, on the charge of disrupting the education of her fellow students.<ref name=teenarchist/> Sierra then contacted the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], who agreed to take up her cause. After a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, the issue was considered settled.<ref name=teenarchist/>

===Escalation===
On October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school, a meeting of the school's [[board of education]] was held which discussed the events of the previous week. Although some board members were initially helpful, comments turned hostile towards the end of the meeting, with Sierra being told "[t]his isn't something funny or cute<U+2026>[y]ou're talking about overthrowing the [[government]]", and having her actions characterized as "like you stood up and waved a Japanese flag on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor day]]".<ref name=teenarchist/> In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked "[w]hat the hell is wrong with a kid like that?" and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing [[treason]].<ref name=colby>{{cite journal |last=Colby |first=Michael |date=[[2001-11-07]] |month= |title=School Girl Gets the Boot for Anti-War Opinions |journal=[[CounterPunch]] |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/colby3.html |accessdate= 2008-03-22}}</ref> Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'' published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's t-shirts included "I hope Afghanistan wins" and "America should burn."; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed.<ref name=teenarchist/> Students spit on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Virginia: Anarchist Teen Pulled From School |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=[[2001-11-27]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school;<ref name=wax>{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Wax |title=The Consequences of Objection |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14157-2001Dec8?language=printer |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=The Washington Post Company |date=[[2001-12-09]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref><ref name=projo>{{cite news |first=David |last=Crumm |title=Author finds anger spreading across America |url=http://www.projo.com/religion/content/projo_20040904_rianger4.2a6ae6.html |work=[[The Providence Journal]] |publisher=[[Knight Ridder Newspapers]] |date=[[2004-09-04]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }} </ref> the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town.<ref name=projo/>

The ACLU filed a suit on Sierra's behalf on [[December 9]] [[2001]] against the school district and Mann, but the suspension was immediately upheld in the [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]] [[Circuit court#State courts|circuit court]].<ref name=wvn/><ref name=teenarchist/> Sierra's [[pro bono]] lawyers claimed that Mann was responsible for disruption, and that he could have taken the opportunity to teach his students about tolerance and constitutional rights instead of making misleading and incendiary comments in the media.<ref name=teenarchist/> The defense countered by saying constitutional rights did not apply equally to adults and students, with the latter not having the same latitude with regards to freedom of speech. Judge James Stucky rejected Sierra's request for a preliminary injunction on November 2, citing her voluntary withdrawal from the county school system,<ref name=ap>{{cite news |title=Teenage anarchist to seek only $1 |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher= |date=[[2002-06-22]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> but scheduled a jury trial for her lawsuit for June 24. Stucky ruled that that the disruption Sierra caused at school overrode her [[right to free speech]],<ref name=wax/> and told that he could not guarantee her safety at Sissonville High School.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Eyre |title=<U+2018>You have some decisions to make,' judge tells Sierra |work=[[Charleston Gazette]] |publisher=Daily Gazette Company |date=[[2001-12-06]]  |accessdate=2008-03-22 }} </ref> The [[West Virginia Supreme Court]] voted 3-2 on November 27 against considering Sierra's petition to prevent the lower court from "continuing to deny her freedom of speech".<ref name=monbiot/>

Motivated by boredom and antipathy towards the "backward<U+2026>narrow-minded<U+2026>racist and sexist" residents of Charleston, Sierra ran away from home on [[April 8]] [[2002]].<ref name=runaway>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Eyre |title=Teen back home after hitchhiking to South Carolina |work=[[Charleston Gazette]] |publisher=Daily Gazette Company |date=[[2002-04-18]]  |accessdate=2008-03-22 }} </ref> Accompanied by a 24-year-old friend, Holly Elizabeth Taylor, she [[hitchhiking|hitched]] rides with [[trucker]]s to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. There, the self-proclaimed "road sisters" took in a concert by [[Tanya Donelly]], whose attempts to convince them to turn back were futile. Although Sierra successfully eluded the police, Taylor was discovered by Sierra's mother and a [[private detective]] she had hired, forcing Sierra to continue alone to [[South Carolina]] where she stayed with a friend. Her mother and the private detective tracked her down after tracing her phone calls to friends, and they returned to West Virginia. Commenting on the escapade, Sierra declared "You're never free. You're always trapped. This is a corrupt society. I'm paranoid to even use the phone anymore."<ref name=runaway/>

The ACLU lawyers decided to drop their suit on June 5 that year after learning that Sierra had moved out of her mother's home and intended on traveling through [[Oregon]], and therefore would not be present at the trial date.<ref name=cdm>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Stirewalt |title=Lawsuit Will Continue without Katie Sierra |work=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] |publisher= |date=[[2002-06-20]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> A day later, they reversed their decision after consulting with Sierra's mother, who had to file the suit on behalf of her daughter, who was a [[minor (law)|minor]] at the time.<ref name=cdm/> The subsequent trial lasted five days, attracting ''[[Court TV]]'', coverage in several [[Japan]]ese major newspapers and television shows,<ref>{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Stone |title=Anarchy story a hit in Japan |work=[[Charleston Gazette]] |publisher=Daily Gazette Company |date=[[2001-11-29]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> and a gallery packed with supporters of both sides.<ref name=trial>{{cite news |first=Laurence |last=Messina |title=Katie Sierra gets mixed verdict in suspension case |work=[[Charleston Gazette]] |publisher=Daily Gazette Company |date=[[2002-07-13]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref>

At the trial, Sierra's former English teacher Jean McCutcheon testified that Sierra's activities at Sissonville High had caused a "simmering feeling", and that she had counseled Sierra that it was a "terrible time in history" to start a club such as the one proposed.<ref name=cdm2>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Stirewalt |title=Katie Sierra Focused on Rights |work=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] |publisher= |date=[[2002-07-11]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> Jacob Reed, the student who had been detained for his comments to Sierra, testified that the "only reason" for Sierra's actions was that she "wants attention".<ref name=cdm2/> He also claimed that Sierra told him she hoped America would lose the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]], and asked why Sierra was opposed to what he saw was "pretty much payback" for the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref name=cdm2/> The philosophy of [[anarchism]] was also a point of contention during the trial.  [[Gordon Simmons]], an adjunct professor of philosophy at [[West Virginia State University]] and [[Marshall University]], testified as Sierra's final witness. His testimony included explanations of the philosophy espoused by Sierra's proposed club, its impact on American social and political movements, and the notion that anarchists had historically been unjustly persecuted in American courts, citing such examples as the trials of the [[Haymarket affair]] and [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. The lawyer for the school officials countered that anarchism had prominent ties to [[Propaganda of the deed|terrorism and assassination]], and referred to [[Timothy McVeigh]] and [[Theodore Kaczynski]] as anarchists.<ref name>{{cite news |first=Laurence |last=Messina |title=Sierra jury hears two views of anarchy |work=[[Charleston Gazette]] |publisher=Daily Gazette Company |date=[[2002-07-10]] |accessdate=2008-04-12 }}</ref> On July 12, the court ruled that Sierra had been justly suspended and forbidden to wear the t-shirts, but had been improperly denied the right to start a club.<ref name=verdict>{{cite news |title=Teen anarchist sues school principal |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/taped/sierra/verdict.html |work=[[Court TV]] |publisher=Courtroom Television Network LLC. |date=[[2002-08-27]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref>

==Reaction to controversy==
[[Image:Katie Sierra in the Land of the Free.gif|thumb|''Katie Sierra in the Land of the Free'', a [[political cartoon]] by [[Indymedia]]'s [[Carlos Latuff]]]]
The controversy over Sierra's suspension and the subsequent trial drew local, national and international media attention. Initial reaction to Sierra's actions from the local media was unsympathetic. This was later attributed by Sierra's lawyers and Dan Radmacher <U+2013> editor of the ''Charleston Gazette'' <U+2013> to Principal Mann's repetition in his comments to the ''Gazette'' of Jacob Reed's statements concerning Sierra's message.<ref name=teenarchist/><ref name=rad>{{cite journal |first=Dan |last=Radmacher |title=Who were the real sophomores in the Katie Sierra case? |journal=[[Charleston Gazette]] |publisher=Daily Gazette Company |date=[[2002-06-12]]  |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> The ''[[Charleston Daily Mail]]'' praised Mann's decision, calling Sierra's "thoroughly egocentric exercise" of her [[constitutional rights]] "tiresome".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Jesse |authorlink=Jesse Walker |year=2002 |month=February |title=Club Anarchy: Why high school sucks |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/28289.html |journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |publisher=[[Reason Foundation]] |accessdate= 2008-03-22 |quote=The local Charleston Daily Mail praised the decision, arguing that "Americans cherish the freedoms guaranteed them under the Constitution, but the thoroughly egocentric exercise of those rights becomes tiresome."}}</ref> Sierra claims that callers to local radio stations "wanted to shoot me in the head. They wanted to send me to another country."<ref name=saxton/>

Conversely, national and international observers were supportive of Sierra and sharply critical of the actions of the state. John Tinker, of ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', pledged his support for Katie, personally emailing Sierra to encourage her and offered to attend further court proceedings. Sierra reported, "he said he'd be in the front row of the courtroom..."<ref>{{cite news |title=John Tinker pledges support for pro-anarchy teen |url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=15460||work=First Amendment Center/[[Associated Press]] |date=[[2001-12-01]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> [[United Kingdom|British]] political writer [[George Monbiot]] decried Sierra's treatment, citing it as an example of state [[persecution]] and the erosion of [[civil liberties]] in the United States,<ref name=monbiot/> while [[progressivism|progressive]] journalist [[Amy Goodman]] characterized it as evidence of "a new [[McCarthyism]]".<ref>{{cite interview |last=Sierra |first=Katie |url=http://www.archive.org/download/dn2001-1211/dn2001-1211-1_64kb.mp3 |interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]] |title=<U+201C>When I Saw the Dead and Dying Afghani Children On TV, I Felt a Newly Recovered Sense Of National Security.

Sierra was one of the "heroes" of [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Dale Maharidge]]'s ''Homeland'', an examination of the [[mind-set]] behind the United States' post-9/11 [[jingoism]] and suppression of dissent.<ref name=sfgate>{{cite journal |last=Canfield |first=Kevin |date=[[2004-08-08]] |title=Emblems of a nation of discontent and dissent |journal=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/08/08/RVGAV7V7BB1.DTL |accessdate= 2008-03-22 }}</ref> Portraying her as an unconventional and "good-hearted kid," Maharidge reported that Sierra took a [[telemarketing]] job following the cessation of the controversy: "She was supposed to make two sales a day. The first day, she made five sales, and continued at that rate. When I again talked with her in the winter, she was living in a dorm and attending [[Marshall University]] in West Virginia. She was happy and her only complaint was that the classes were too easy."<ref name=sfgate/>

==Beliefs==
Sierra identifies as an [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarchist-pacifist]] who is opposed to all [[violence]] and advocates "a peaceful revolution".<ref name=teenarchist/> In the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], she was taken aback by the wave of "flag-waving", increasing [[patriotism]] and "blind, unthinking"<ref name=infoshop/> advocacy of war on the part of her fellow students, who she believed ignored existing problems such as [[racism]] and [[homophobia]]. At the time of the controversy, she voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about how they felt about certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them.<ref name=infoshop>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070419221553/http://www.infoshop.org/interviews/katie_sierra.html |archivedate=2007-04-19 |url=http://www.infoshop.org/interviews/katie_sierra.html |title=Infoshop Interviews - Katie Sierra |accessdate=2008-03-22 |work=[[Infoshop.org]] }}</ref> She denies being [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]],<ref name=teenarchist/> and that anarchism implies support for [[terrorism]],<ref name=saxton>{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Saxton |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050418185905/www.sun-sentinel.com/news/nationworld/sfl-111anarchy.story?coll=sfla-news-fringe |archivedate=2006-12-06 |title=Student loses bid to form high school anarchy club |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/nationworld/sfl-111anarchy.story?coll=sfla-news-fringe |work=[[Associated Press]]/[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=[[2001-11-01]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> countering that it is an [[anti-authoritarian]] and [[nonviolence|non-violent]] philosophy.
