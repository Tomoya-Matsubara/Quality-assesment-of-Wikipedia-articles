"'''I Will Follow You Into the Dark'''" is [[Grammy]]-nominated song by [[Death Cab for Cutie]] and the third single from their sixth album ''[[Plans (album)|Plans]]''. It is a [[Solo (music)|solo]], [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] [[Ballad (music)|ballad]] written and performed by frontman [[Ben Gibbard]] and was recorded in [[monaural]] with a single microphone and little editing. Two [[music video]]s<U+2014>one appearing on ''[[Directions: The Plans Video Album]]''<U+2014>have been made to the song.

Its critical reception has been generally positive, and it is the group's highest charting single in the [[United Kingdom]] where the singles were exclusively released. 

==Recording==
While [[Tracker|tracking]] the vocals for a different song, technical issues arose with the [[headphone]] mix. Producer [[Chris Walla]] told Gibbard to take a break while the issues were being addressed. Gibbard picked up his [[Stella (guitar)|Stella]] guitar and began playing "I Will Follow You into the Dark", originally planned to be recorded later in the sessions. Gibbard's playing was still going through the vocal microphone while playing, and Walla was impressed by the sound, leading him to suggest they do a quick tracking of the performance. It was this mono recording that appears on the album ''Plans'', with the only editing being mild [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and [[de-essing]].<ref>http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_death_cab_cutie_2/index.html</ref>

==Music videos==
[[Image:IWillFollowYouIntotheDarkMusicVideo.jpg|thumb|In this screenshot of the main music video, Ben Gibbard plays his guitar in a sparse room while the ever-widening hole in the floor dominates the foreground.]]
The main music video features Ben Gibbard playing the song while sitting on his bed when he notices a hole in the wooden floor. Gibbard goes about daily activities while avoiding the constantly expanding hole. He eventually rolls out of bed into it, only to discover that what he thought was a black void is actually solid ground. The song ends with Gibbard walking into the darkness. The camera then pans to show the entire room again with the floor restored to its original, intact state. This music video, which was filmed in [[Romania]], was directed by [[Jamie Thraves]], best known for his video for [[Radiohead]]'s single "[[Just (song)|Just]]."

An alternate video directed by Monkmus appears on the band's DVD ''[[Directions: The Plans Video Album]]''.  In this video, a picture-book takes up the center of the video frame, and the pages turn as the song progresses. Within the book, two rabbits meet and fall in love. Time passes until one of the rabbits apparently dies. There are other references to death throughout the video, such as a rotten bowl of fruit and an elderly man who appears to die, leaving his grandson behind. The video ends with a picture of the two rabbits together, presumably in eternal happiness together.

==Release==
"I Will Follow You Into the Dark" has two separate [[United Kingdom]]-exclusive, [[Unusual types of gramophone records|colored vinyl]] 7" releases with [[B-side]]s recorded as part of their ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' originals session. The part one vinyl is colored green with the B-side of "Photobooth" and the part two vinyl is colored yellow with a B-side of "Brothers on a Hotel Bed". The CD single was also only released in the UK and contains the same "Brothers on a Hotel Bed" B-side.

==Critical reaction==
Critical response to "I Will Follow You into the Dark" was generally positive. In their reviews for the album ''Plans'', [[Robert Christgau]] selected the song as his "choice cut",<ref>http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Death+Cab+for+Cutie</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]] called it the album's "quiet centerpiece" and praised its "unexpected turns of phrase",<ref>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16928/Death_Cab_for_Cutie_Plans</ref> [[Pop Matters]] called it "one of the best written pop songs of the year -- if not of the past five years",<ref>http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/d/deathcabforcutie-plans.shtml</ref> and [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] stated that it was "one of the band<U+2019>s best songs to date."<ref>http://tinymixtapes.com/Death-Cab-for-Cutie,1990</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' however, said that the song "demonstrates how wise Gibbard is to let the band mess with his pristine melodies, which would sound wispy and ignorable on their own."<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/deathcabforcutie/albums/album/7568289/review/7581237/plans</ref>

The song was [[Nominees for Grammy Awards of 2007|nominated]] for the 2007 [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], but lost to "[[My Humps]]" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. The category is odd in that it credits the entire Death Cab for Cutie group for Gibbard's solo performance.
