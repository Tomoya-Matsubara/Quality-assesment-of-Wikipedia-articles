'''Abbey Road Studios''', created in November of [[1931]] by [[EMI]] in [[London]], is best known as the legendary [[recording studio]] used by the [[rock bands]] [[The Beatles]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Shadows]]. The studios are located in [[Abbey Road (street)|Abbey Road]], in [[St John's Wood]] in the [[City of Westminster]].

==History==
Built as a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[townhouse]] in [[1831]], the premises were acquired by The [[Gramophone Company]] in [[1931]] and converted into studios.  The neighbouring house is also owned by the studio and used to house musicians.  During the mid-1900s the studio was extensively used by leading British conductor Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], whose house was just around the corner from the studio.

The Gramophone Company later amalgamated with [[Columbia Graphophone Company]] to form [[EMI]] which took over the studios. The studios were then known as '''EMI studios''' until they changed their name to Abbey Road Studios formally in the [[1970s]].

Studio Two at Abbey Road became a centre of rock music in [[1958]] when [[Cliff Richard]] and the Drifters (later Cliff Richard and [[The Shadows]]), recorded ''Move It'', arguably the first European [[rock 'n' roll]] single. It also witnessed the beginnings of a change from "rock 'n' roll" to "Rock". The Beatles also found great success in Studio Two, and during the early-to-mid-[[1960s|'60s]], the Beatles and Cliff and The Shadows became almost like joint owners of the studio, with friendly battles for recording time.

It was the Beatles who broke with tradition, changing recording techniques, and forever changing the boundaries of what was considered Popular music. Inventing flanging, backwards recording, automatic double tracking, and the first band to use feedback on a recording, The Beatles utilised Abbey Road studios to full effect. 

Abbey Road Studios is most closely associated with [[The Beatles]], who recorded almost all of their albums and singles there between 1962 and 1970. The Beatles named their [[1969 in music|1969 album]], ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'', after the street where the studio is located (the recording studio, formely called EMI Studios, would only be named Abbey Road after the Beatles record in [[1970]]). The cover photo for that album was taken by Iain Macmillan outside Abbey Road studios, with the result that the pedestrian [[zebra crossing]] outside the studio, where the Fab Four were photographed, soon became a place of pilgrimage for Beatles fans from all over the world. Among the less desirable effects of this notoreity has been the unsightly [[graffiti]] written on the studio fence by visitors and the regular theft of road signs. [[Pink Floyd]] recorded most of their late '60s to mid-1970s albums (like [[Dark Side of the Moon]], [[Atom Heart Mother]] and [[Wish You Were Here (album)|Wish You Were Here]])  at the studio as well.  [[Elliott Smith]] also recorded "In the Lost and Found" from his "Figure 8" album at the studio.

The Shadows named their ''Live At Abbey Road'' album after the studio, with the cover spoofing the Beatles' album. Studio Two was also used by [[the Hollies]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[the Seekers]], [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]], [[Martin Briley]] and others.

Notable producers and engineers who have worked at Abbey Road include [[George Martin|Sir George Martin]], [[Geoff Emerick]], [[Norman Smith|Norman "Hurricane" Smith]], [[Ken Scott]], [[Mike Stone]], [[Alan Parsons]], Phil McDonald, Richard Lush and [[Ken Townshend]], who invented the groundbreaking studio effect known as [[automatic double tracking]] (ADT).  The chief mastering engineer at Abbey Road was Chris "Vinyl" Blair, who started his career early on as a tape deck operator. He worked his way up the ranks to get to the top. A highlight of Chris's career was receiving an award for [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]''. Chris died on [[November 7]] [[2005]].

[[Kanye West]] had a live concert in the Abbey Road Studios in late 2005, following the release of the live-album version of ''[[Late Registration]]''. Featured on the cover is his mascot ,[[Drop Out Bear]], on Abbey Road street (imitation of the Beatles cover).

==Film scores ==

Abbey Road Studios got its start in the [[film score|film scoring]] business in [[1980 in film|1980]], when [[Anvil Post Production]] formed a partnership with the studio, called Anvil-Abbey Road Screen Sound.  The partnership started when Anvil was left without a scoring stage when [[Korda Studios]] were demolished.  It ended in [[1984 in film|1984]], when EMI merged with [[THORN Electrical Industries Ltd.|Thorn]] to become [[Thorn EMI]].
