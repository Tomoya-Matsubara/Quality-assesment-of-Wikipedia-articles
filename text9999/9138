'''Sir James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave''' [[Order of the Garter|KG]] [[Privy Council of Great Britain|PC]] (1684 <U+2013> 11 April 1741) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[ambassador]].

Waldegrave was the son of the [[Henry Waldegrave, 1st Baron Waldegrave|1st Baron Waldegrave]] and [[Henrietta Waldegrave, Baroness Waldegrave|Henrietta FitzJames]], the illegitimate daughter of [[James II of England|James II]] and [[Arabella Churchill (royal mistress)|Arabella Churchill]].

Waldegrave inherited his father's title in 1690 and on 20 May 1714, he married Mary Webb (who died in childbirth in 1719), a daughter of [[Sir John Webb, 3rd Baronet]] and they had three surviving children:

*[[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Hon. James Waldegrave]] (1714&ndash;1763)
*[[John Waldegrave, 3rd Earl Waldegrave|Hon. John Waldegrave]] (1718&ndash;1784)
*Lady Henrietta Waldegrave (1717&ndash;1753), married firstly, Lord Edward Herbert, a son of the [[William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis|2nd Marquess of Powis]] and had issue; married secondly, [[John Beard (tenor)|John Beard]] (a singer at [[Covent Garden]]).

After the death of his wife, he converted from [[Roman Catholicism]] (the religion he was brought up with) to [[Church of England|Anglicanism]] in order to take his seat in the [[House of Lords]]. He was briefly a [[Lord of the Bedchamber]] in 1723 and then from 1730&ndash;41 and [[Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Austria|Ambassador to Austria]] from 1727&ndash;30 and to [[British Ambassador to France|France]] from 1730&ndash;40. During his ambassadorship to France, he still spent enough time in [[London]] to be one of the founding Governors of the new charity there, known as the [[Foundling Hospital]] (created in 1739). In 1729, he had been created [[Earl Waldegrave]] and on his death in 1741, was succeeded by his eldest son, [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|James]].

Waldegrave was the first person to discuss what would become [[game theory]] in a 1713 letter concerning the card game le Her.
