'''''American Beauty''''' is a 1999 American drama film directed by [[Sam Mendes]] and written by [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]]. [[Kevin Spacey]] stars as office worker Lester Burnham, who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela ([[Mena Suvari]]). [[Annette Bening]] co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and [[Thora Birch]] plays their insecure daughter, Jane; [[Wes Bentley]], [[Chris Cooper (actor)|Chris Cooper]] and [[Allison Janney]] also feature. The film has been described by academics as a satire of [[American middle class]] notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], self-liberation and redemption.

Ball began writing ''American Beauty'' as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus around the [[Amy Fisher]] trial in 1992. He shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry. The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers [[Dan Jinks]] and [[Bruce Cohen]] took ''American Beauty'' to [[DreamWorks]]; the fledgling film studio bought Ball's script for $250,000, outbidding several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15&nbsp;million production and served as the North American distributor. ''American Beauty'' marked acclaimed theater director Mendes' film debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals ''[[Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', Mendes was nevertheless only given the job after twenty others were considered and several "A-list" directors turned down the opportunity.

Spacey was Mendes' first choice for the role of Lester, even though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better-known actors; similarly, the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without DreamWorks' knowledge. [[Principal photography]] took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. [[backlot]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer [[Conrad Hall]] complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone.

Released in North America on September&nbsp;15, 1999, ''American Beauty'' was positively received by critics and audiences alike; it was the best-reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $350&nbsp;million worldwide. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase ''American Beauty''{{'}}s chances of [[Academy Award]] success; at the [[72nd Academy Awards]] the following year, the film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Spacey), [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].

==Plot==
Lester Burnham ([[Kevin Spacey]]) is a middle-aged magazine writer who despises his job. His wife, Carolyn ([[Annette Bening]]), is an ambitious real-estate broker; their sixteen-year-old daughter, Jane ([[Thora Birch]]), abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are retired [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Frank Fitts ([[Chris Cooper (actor)|Chris Cooper]]) and his introverted wife, Barbara ([[Allison Janney]]); their teenage son, Ricky ([[Wes Bentley]]), is a secret marijuana smoker and drug dealer whom the colonel subjects to a strict disciplinarian lifestyle. Ricky, who had been forced into a military academy and mental hospital, spends time recording his surroundings with a camcorder; he keeps dozens of taped videos in his bedroom.

Lester becomes infatuated with Jane's cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes ([[Mena Suvari]]), after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine at a high school basketball game. He begins to have sexual fantasies about Angela, during which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with a business rival, Buddy Kane ([[Peter Gallagher]]). When Lester is about to be laid off his job he blackmails his boss for $60,000 and quits, taking employment serving fast food. He buys his dream car and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he improved his physique. He begins smoking marijuana bought from Ricky and flirts with Angela whenever she visits Jane. Jane becomes involved with Ricky and they bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed: a plastic bag dancing in the wind.<ref name="film">[[Sam Mendes|Mendes, Sam]] (Director). (1999). ''American Beauty'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[DreamWorks]].</ref>

Lester discovers Carolyn's infidelity but reacts indifferently. Buddy ends the affair, saying he is facing an expensive divorce. Frank becomes suspicious of Lester and Ricky's friendship, and finds his son's footage of Lester lifting weights while nude, which Ricky captured by chance. Carolyn becomes distraught, loads a gun and drives home. That night, after watching Ricky and Lester through Lester's garage window, Frank mistakenly concludes the pair are sexually involved. He later beats Ricky and accuses him of being gay. Ricky falsely admits the charge and goads his father into kicking him out of their home. Ricky convinces Jane to flee with him to New York City, and tells the vain Angela she is ordinary.

Frank confronts Lester and attempts to kiss him; Lester rebuffs the colonel, who leaves. Lester finds a distraught Angela, who begins to seduce him. After learning that Angela is a virgin, Lester stops and comforts her; the pair instead bond over their shared frustrations. Angela goes to the bathroom and Lester smiles at a family photograph in his kitchen. A gunshot sounds and blood splatters on the wall. Ricky and Jane find Lester's body. Carolyn is seen crying in the bedroom, and Frank returns home, bloodied, a gun missing from his collection. Lester's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life; he says that despite his death he is happy, as there's so much beauty in the world.<ref name="film"/>

==Themes and analysis==
===Multiple interpretations===
Academics have offered many possible readings of ''American Beauty''; film critics are similarly divided, not so much about the quality of the film as their interpretations of it.<ref name="booth 129">{{harvnb|Booth|2002|p=129}}</ref> Described by many as about "the meaning of life" or "gender identification" or "the hollow existence of the American suburbs",<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2006|p=23}}</ref> the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: "a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories&nbsp;... it was about imprisonment&nbsp;... loneliness [and] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad."<ref name="booth 126"/> The literary critic and author [[Wayne C. Booth]] concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: "[''American Beauty''] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds'; but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester's or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live&nbsp;..."<ref name="booth 129"/> He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center<U+2014>a controlling voice who "[unites] all of the choices".{{#tag:ref|Some postmodernist readings would posit no need for an identified voice; see [[Death of the Author]].|group="nb"}}<ref name="booth 126">{{harvnb|Booth|2002|p=126}}</ref> He contends that in ''American Beauty''{{'}}s case it is neither Mendes nor Ball.<ref name="booth 128">{{harvnb|Booth|2002|p=128}}</ref> Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was "strongly influential" on set,<ref name="booth 126"/> he often had to accept deviations from his vision,<ref name="booth 128"/> particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic.<ref name="booth 126<U+2013>128">{{harvnb|Booth|2002|pages=126<U+2013>128}}</ref> With "innumerable voices intruding on the original author's," Booth says, those who interpret ''American Beauty'' "have forgotten to probe for the elusive center". According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy "that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting".<ref name="booth 129"/>

===Imprisonment and redemption===
[[Image:American Beauty jail cell.png|300px|thumb|alt=A computer monitor on a busy cubicle desk. The monitor displays a spreadsheet in seven columns which span the height of the screen. The monitor also shows the reflection of a middle-aged man in a shirt and tie, sitting close to the desk and wearing a telephone headset. The contrasts<U+2014>the monitor's dark background, and the lightness of the text and the man's shirt<U+2014>make the reflection more prominent between and behind the numbers.|Lester's reflection in the monitor is intended to resemble a man in a jail cell, evoking the director's intended theme of imprisonment and escape from imprisonment.<ref name="chapter 1"/><ref name="anker 348-349"/>]]
Mendes called ''American Beauty'' a rites of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester's existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing.<ref name="chapter 1"/> In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, "reiterating rituals that hardly please him". He masturbates in the confines of his shower;<ref name="hausmann 118">{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=118}}</ref> the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames,<ref name="chapter 1"/><ref name="anker 348-349">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=348<U+2013>349}}</ref> such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, "confined [and] nearly crossed out".<ref name="hausmann 118"/> The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester's journey is the story's center.<ref name="pennington 104"/> His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to "[throw] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise".<ref name="Munt 264-265"/> After Lester shares a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 8}}</ref> Changed by Ricky's "attractive, profound confidence", Lester is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his "banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence"; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could "see his whole life ahead of him".<ref name="hausmann 118-119">{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|pages=118<U+2013>119}}</ref>

When Lester is caught masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her.<ref name="chapter 11"/> By confronting the issue and Carolyn's "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to "regain a voice in a home that [only respects] the voices of mother and daughter".<ref name="hausmann 118-119"/> His final turning point comes when he and Angela almost have sex;<ref name="chapter 25"/> after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter.<ref name="pennington 105"/> He holds her close and "wraps her up". Mendes called it "the most satisfying end to [Lester's] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks "to meet his fate".<ref name="chapter 25"/><ref name="kemp 26"/> Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure.<ref name="pennington 105">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=105}}</ref> As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 26}}</ref> His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is "the culmination of the theme" of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 27}}</ref>

===Conformity and beauty===
Like other [[List of American films of 1999|American films of 1999]]<U+2014>such as ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[Bringing Out the Dead]]'' and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''<U+2014>''American Beauty'' instructs its audience to "[lead] more meaningful lives".<ref>Desowitz, Bill (December&nbsp;12, 1999). [http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/12/arts/film-finding-spiritual-rebirth-in-a-valley-of-male-ennui.html?pagewanted=all "Finding Spiritual Rebirth In a Valley of Male Ennui"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'': 215.</ref> The film argues the case against conformity, but does not deny that people need and want it; even the gay characters just want to fit in.<ref name="Munt 265"/> Jim and Jim, the Burnhams' other neighbors, are a satire of "gay bourgeois coupledom",<ref name="munt 274">{{harvnb|Munt|2006|p=274}}</ref> who "[invest] in the numbing sameness" that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples.{{#tag:ref|Despite their desire to conform, Jim and Jim are openly, proudly gay, a contradiction that [[Sally Rowena Munt|Sally R. Munt]] says may seem strange to heterosexual audiences.<ref name="Munt 265"/>|group="nb"}}<ref>{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=112}}</ref> The feminist academic and author [[Sally Rowena Munt|Sally R. Munt]] argues that ''American Beauty'' uses its "art house" trappings to direct its message of non-conformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a "clich<U+00E9> of bourgeois preoccupation&nbsp;... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual 'self' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel."<ref name="Munt 264-265">{{harvnb|Munt|2006|pp=264<U+2013>265}}</ref>

Professor Roy M. Anker argues that the film's thematic center is its direction to the audience to "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission that he will soon die, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them.<ref name="anker 345">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=345}}</ref> It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, "from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story?&nbsp;... if he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive?&nbsp;... There is also the question of how Lester has died<U+2014>or will die." Anker believes the preceding scene<U+2014>Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father<U+2014>adds further mystery.<ref name="anker 347">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=347}}</ref> Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside "to view the film and its philosophical issues".<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2006|p=24}}</ref> Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, ''American Beauty'' satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction.<ref name="anker 347<U+2013>348">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=347<U+2013>348}}</ref> Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a "willing devotee of the popular media's exultation of pubescent male sexuality as a route to personal wholeness".<ref name="anker 348">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=348}}</ref> Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in "[[House Beautiful|house beautiful]]" domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden".<ref name="anker 349<U+2013>350">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=349<U+2013>350}}</ref> The Burnhams are unaware that they are "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" who expect the "rudiments of American beauty" to give them happiness. Anker argues that "they are helpless in the face of the prettified economic and sexual stereotypes&nbsp;... that they and their culture have designated for their salvation."<ref name="anker 350"/>

The film presents Ricky as its "visionary&nbsp;... its spiritual and mystical center".<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2006|p=27}}</ref> He sees beauty in the minutiae of everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was "an entire life behind things"; he feels that "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it&nbsp;... and my heart is going to cave in." Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the "cultural dross", has "[grasped] the radiant splendor of the created world" to see God.<ref name="anker 356">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=356}}</ref> As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world.<ref>{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=360}}</ref> Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so Lester sees himself, Angela and his family "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times,<ref name="anker 358<U+2013>359">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=358<U+2013>359}}</ref> and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"<U+2014>he has finally seen the world as it is.<ref name="anker 347<U+2013>348"/>

According to Patti Bellantoni, colors are used symbolically throughout the film,<ref name="color 25">{{harvnb|Bellantoni|2005|p=25}}</ref> none more so than red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and "[defines] Lester's arc". First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality.<ref name="color 27">{{harvnb|Bellantoni|2005|p=27}}</ref> The [[Rosa 'American Beauty'|American Beauty rose]] is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a "fa<U+00E7>ade for suburban success".<ref name="pennington 104"/> Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams' home, where they signify "a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality".<ref name="anker 350">{{harvnb|Anker|2004|p=350}}</ref> Carolyn feels that "as long as there can be roses, all is well".<ref name="anker 350"/> She cuts the roses and puts them in vases,<ref name="pennington 104"/> where they adorn her "meretricious vision of what makes for beauty"<ref name="anker 350"/> and begin to die.<ref name="pennington 104"/> The roses in the vase in the Angela<U+2013>Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester's previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses<U+2014>and thus Carolyn<U+2014>out of the shot.<ref name="chapter 25"/> Lester's epiphany at the end of the film is expressed via rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels.<ref name="shohan"/> The constant use of red "lulls [the audience] subliminally" into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall.<ref name="color 27"/>

===Sexuality and repression===
Pennington argues that ''American Beauty'' defines its characters through their sexuality. Lester's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela,<ref name="pennington 104">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=104}}</ref> and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact. Also sexually frustrated, Carolyn has an affair that takes her from "cold perfectionist" to a more carefree soul who "[sings] happily along with" the music in her car.<ref name="pennington 105-106"/> Jane and Angela constantly reference sex, through Angela's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other.<ref name="pennington 105-106">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|pp=105<U+2013>106}}</ref> Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability.<ref name="chapter 25"/><ref name="chapter 18"/> By the end of the film, Angela's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester's attraction to her.<ref name="chapter 23">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 23}}</ref> Col. Fitts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim; he asks, "How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face? How can they be so shameless?" To which Ricky replies, "That's the thing, Dad<U+2014>they don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of." Pennington argues that Col. Fitts' reaction is not homophobic, but an "anguished self-interrogation".<ref name="pennington 106">{{harvnb|Pennington|2007|p=106}}</ref>

With other turn-of-the-millennium films such as ''Fight Club'', ''[[In the Company of Men]]''&nbsp;(1997), ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''&nbsp;(2000) and ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]''&nbsp;(1999), ''American Beauty'' "raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis".<ref name="Hausmann 117">{{harvnb|2004|p=117}}</ref> Professor Vincent Hausmann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity "against threats posed by war, by consumerism, and by feminist and queer challenges", these films present a need to "focus on, and even to privilege" aspects of maleness "deemed 'deviant{{'"}}. Lester's transformation conveys "that he, and not the woman, has borne the brunt of [lack of being]"{{#tag:ref|According to Hausmann, "These films appear to suggest that [the film theorist] [[Kaja Silverman]]'s wish 'that the typical male subject, like his female counterpart, might learn to live with lack'<U+2014>namely, the 'lack of being' that remains 'the irreducible condition of subjectivity'<U+2014> has not yet been fulfilled."<ref name="Hausmann 117"/> See Silverman, Kaja (1992). ''Male Subjectivity at the Margins'' (New York: [[Routledge]]): 65+20. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/9780415904193|9780415904193]].|group="nb"}} and he will not stand for being emasculated.<ref>{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=117}}</ref> Lester's attempts to "strengthen traditional masculinity" conflict with his responsibilities as a father. Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively, he does not become "the hypermasculine figure implicitly celebrated in films like ''Fight Club''". Hausmann concludes that Lester's behavior toward Angela is "a misguided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again".<ref name="hausmann 118"/>

Hausmann says the film "explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against incest";<ref>{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=113}}</ref> a recurring theme of Ball's work is his comparison of the taboos against incest and homosexuality.<ref>{{harvnb|Munt|2006|p=267}}</ref> Instead of making an overt distinction, ''American Beauty'' looks at how their repression can lead to violence.<ref name="Munt 266">{{harvnb|Munt|2006|p=266}}</ref> Col. Fitts is so ashamed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester;<ref name="pennington 106"/> by comparison, the openly gay Jim and Jim are the most well-adjusted characters in the film. Ball said, "The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [they] can do."<ref name="ball"/> The film implies two unfulfilled incestuous desires:<ref name="Munt 265">{{harvnb|Munt|2006|p=265}}</ref> Lester's pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter,<ref name="Munt 264">{{harvnb|Munt|2006|p=264}}</ref> while Col. Fitts' repression is exhibited through the almost sexualized discipline with which he controls Ricky.<ref name="Munt 265"/> Consequently, Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual.<ref name="chapter 23"/> Col. Fitts represents Ball's father,<ref>{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=127}}</ref> whose repressed homosexual desires led to his own unhappiness.<ref>{{harvnb|Hausmann|2004|p=148}}</ref> Ball rewrote Col. Fitts to delay revealing him as homosexual, which Munt reads as a possible "deferment of Ball's own patriarchal-incest fantasies".<ref name="Munt 266"/>

===Temporality and music===
''American Beauty'' follows a traditional narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Dr Jacqueline Furby says that the plot "occupies&nbsp;... no time [or] all time", citing Lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it "stretches on forever like an ocean of time".<ref name="Furby 2006 22">{{harvnb|Furby|2006|p=22}}</ref> Furby argues that a "rhythm of repetition" forms the core of the film's structure.<ref>{{harvnb|Furby|2006|p=25}}</ref> For example, two scenes see the Burnhams' sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 17}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Furby|2006|pp=25<U+2013>26}}</ref> Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly "voyeuristic and exhibitionist" scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.<ref name="Furby 2006 22"/>

Lester's fantasies are emphasized by slow motion and repetitive motion shots;<ref>{{harvnb|Furby|2006|p=23}}</ref> Mendes uses double-and-triple cut backs in several sequences,<ref name="chapter 11"/><ref name="chapter 4"/> and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 9}}</ref> One example is the gymnasium scene<U+2014>Lester's first encounter with Angela.

The effect is one that Associate Professor Stan Link likens to "vertical time", described by the composer and music theorist [[Jonathan Kramer]] as music that imparts "a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite 'now' that nonetheless feels like an instant".{{#tag:ref|Kramer uses the analogy of looking at a sculpture: "We determine for ourselves the pacing of our experience: we are free to walk around the piece, view it from many angles, concentrate on some details, see other details in relationship to each other, step back and view the whole, see the relationship between the piece and the space in which we see it, leave the room when we wish close our eyes and remember, and return for further viewings."<ref name="link 86"/>|group="nb"}} The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela.

According to Drew Miller of ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'', the soundtrack "[gives] unconscious voice" to the characters' psyches and complements the subtext. The most obvious use of pop music "accompanies and gives context to" Lester's attempts to recapture his youth; reminiscent of how the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] combated American repression through music and drugs, Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music.{{#tag:ref|Another example comes with the songs that Carolyn picks to accompany the Burnhams' dinners<U+2014>upbeat "[[elevator music]]" which is later replaced with more discordant tunes that reflect the "escalating tension" at the table. When Jane plays "[[Cancer for the Cure]]", she switches off after a few moments because her parents return home. The moment reinforces her as someone whose voice is "cut short", as does her lack of association with as clearly defined genres as her parents.<ref name="miller"/>|group="nb"}} Mendes' song choices "progress through the history of American popular music". Miller argues that although some may be over familiar, there is a parodic element at work, "making good on [the film's] encouragement that viewers look closer". Toward the end of the film, [[Thomas Newman]]'s score features more prominently, creating "a disturbing tempo" that matches the tension of the visuals. The exception is "[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]", which plays during Angela's seduction of Lester. At first appropriate, its tone clashes as the seduction stops. The lyrics, which speak of "castles burning", can be seen as a metaphor for Lester's view of Angela<U+2014>"the rosy, fantasy-driven exterior of the 'American Beauty{{'"}}<U+2014>as it burns away to reveal "the timid, small-breasted girl who, like his wife, has willfully developed a false public self".<ref name="miller">Miller, Drew (July&nbsp;20, 2004).

===Development===
In 1997, Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms ''[[Grace Under Fire (TV series)|Grace Under Fire]]'' and ''[[Cybill]]''. He joined the [[United Talent Agency]]&nbsp;(UTA), where his representative, Andrew Cannava, suggested he write a [[spec script]] to "reintroduce [himself] to the town as a screenwriter". Ball pitched three ideas to Cannava: two conventional romantic comedies and ''American Beauty'',{{#tag:ref|At that point called ''American Rose''.<ref name="fanshawe"/>|group="nb"}}<ref name="cohen 07-03">Cohen, David S.

''Variety''.</ref> which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s.<ref name="kazan 25"/> Despite the story's lack of an easily marketable concept, Cannava selected ''American Beauty'' because he felt it was the one Ball had the most passion for.<ref name="chumo 26">{{harvnb|Chumo II|2000|p=26}}</ref> While developing the script, Ball created another television sitcom, ''[[Oh, Grow Up]]''. He channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show<U+2014>and during his tenures on ''Grace Under Fire'' and ''Cybill''<U+2014>into writing ''American Beauty''.<ref name="cohen 07-03"/>

Ball did not expect to sell the script, believing it would act as more of a calling card, but ''American Beauty'' drew interest from several production bodies.<ref name="chumo 27"/> Cannava passed the script to several producers, including [[Dan Jinks]] and [[Bruce Cohen]], who took it to [[DreamWorks]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|p=28}}</ref> With the help of executives Glenn Williamson and Bob Cooper, and [[Steven Spielberg]] in his capacity as studio partner, Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks;<ref name="kazan 28-29">{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|pages=28<U+2013>29}}</ref> he received assurances from the studio<U+2014>known at the time for its more conventional fare<U+2014>that it would not "iron the [edges] out".{{#tag:ref|Ball said he decided on DreamWorks after an accidental meeting with Spielberg in the [[Amblin Entertainment]] car park, where the writer became confident that Spielberg "got" the script and its intended tone.<ref name="kazan 28-29"/>|group="nb"}}<ref name="chumo 27">{{harvnb|Chumo II|2000|p=27}}</ref> In an unusual move, DreamWorks decided not to [[option (filmmaking)|option]] the script;<ref>{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|p=30}}</ref> instead, in April 1998, the studio bought it outright<ref name="grateful">Staff (April&nbsp;14, 1998).

Jinks and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film's development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about twenty interested directors,<ref name="kazan 31">{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|page=31}}</ref> several of whom were considered "[[A-list]]" at the time. Ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become "nervous about the content".<ref name="chumo 28"/> Nevertheless, the studio offered the film to [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Robert Zemeckis]]; neither accepted.<ref name="lowenstein 251"/> In the same year, Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' in New York with fellow director [[Rob Marshall]]. Beth Swofford of the [[Creative Artists Agency]] arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility.{{#tag:ref|Mendes had considered the idea before; he almost took on ''[[The Wings of the Dove (1997 film)|The Wings of the Dove]]''&nbsp;(1997) and had previously failed to secure financing for an adaptation of the play ''[[The Rise and Fall of Little Voice]]'', which he directed in 1992.

Mendes found that he still had to convince DreamWorks' production executives to let him direct.<ref name="lowenstein 251"/> He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen, and felt they supported him.<ref name="lowenstein 252">{{Harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|p=252}}</ref> Ball was also keen; having seen ''Cabaret'', he was impressed with Mendes' "keen visual sense" and thought he did not make obvious choices.

Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s. In about 1991<U+2013>92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the [[World Trade Center]]. He watched the bag for ten minutes, saying later that it provoked an "unexpected emotional response".<ref>{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|p=24}}</ref> In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the [[Amy Fisher]] trial.<ref name="chumo 26"/> Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized.<ref name="kazan 25">{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|p=25}}</ref> He said he "felt like there was a real story underneath [that was] more fascinating and way more tragic" than the story presented to the public,<ref name="chumo 26"/> and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages,<ref name="kazan 25"/> but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film.<ref name="chumo 26"/> He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.<ref>{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|p=37}}</ref>

Ball based Lester's story on aspects of his own life.<ref name="Chumo II 2000 pages=26<U+2013>27">{{harvnb|Chumo II|2000|pages=26<U+2013>27}}</ref> Lester's re-examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid-30s;<ref name="chumo 32-33">{{harvnb|Chumo II|2000|pages=32<U+2013>33}}</ref> like Lester, Ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect.<ref name="Chumo II 2000 pages=26<U+2013>27"/> Scenes in Ricky's household reflect Ball's own childhood experiences.<ref name="chumo 27"/> Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col.

''The Advocate'': 91<U+2013>92.</ref> Ball said the script's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional, but that it came unconsciously from his own outlook on life. He said the juxtaposition produced a starker contrast, giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone.<ref name="chumo 30">{{harvnb|Chumo II|2000|p=30}}</ref>

In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors, Lester and Angela had sex;<ref name="kazan 32"/> by the time of shooting, Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version.<ref name="chumo 33">{{harvnb|Chumo II|2000|p=33}}</ref> Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script, feeling they were being puritanical; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks' then-president [[Walter F.

Fitts service in the Marines, a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings. In love with another Marine, Col.

The shooting script features a scene in Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a "big scene on a freeway"<ref name="chumo 35"/> in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body.<ref name="kazan 36">{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|p=36}}</ref> The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs.<ref name="chumo 35"/> The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available.<ref name="kazan 36"/> Ball agreed, but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." Jane asks: "And what do you see?" Ricky: "Beauty." Ball said, "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important.

Mendes had Spacey and Bening in mind for the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks executives were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including [[Bruce Willis]], [[Kevin Costner]] or [[John Travolta]] to play Lester, and [[Helen Hunt]] or [[Holly Hunter]] to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want a big star "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' and ''[[Seven (film)|Seven]]'', and 1992's ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]''.<ref name="lowenstein 253<U+2013>254">{{Harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|pp=253<U+2013>254}}</ref> Spacey was surprised; he said, "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart&nbsp;... I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living one step at a time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts."<ref name="weinraub"/> Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes,<ref name="lowenstein 253<U+2013>254"/> by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.<ref>Fleming, Michael (September&nbsp;15, 1998).

You'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference." Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a "[[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] president coif" hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail order catalogs to better establish Carolyn's environment of a "spotless suburban manor".<ref name="gordinier 2"/> To help Bening get into Carolyn's mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like.<ref name="lowenstein 257-258">{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|pp=257<U+2013>258}}</ref> He lent Bening the [[Bobby Darin]] version of the song "[[Don't Rain on My Parade]]", which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car.<ref name="gordinier 2">Gordinier, Jeff (March&nbsp;1, 2000).

Mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals, although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater, and the actors could not be present at every one.<ref name="lowenstein 257-258"/> Several improvisations and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script.<ref name="chumo 28"/> An early scene showing the Burnhams leaving home for work was inserted late on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester's relationship had reached.<ref name="chapter 1"/> Spacey and Bening worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another; for example, the scene in which Lester almost seduces Carolyn after the pair argue over Lester's buying a car was originally "strictly contentious".<ref name="kazan 34">{{harvnb|Kazan|2000|p=34}}</ref>

The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot's "Blondie Street" for the Burnhams' and Fitts' homes.{{#tag:ref|One of which director of photography Conrad Hall had filmed for ''[[Divorce American Style]]''&nbsp;(1967).<ref name="impeccable 75"/>|group="nb"}}<ref name="shohan"/> The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight<U+2014>between Ricky and Jane's bedroom windows, and between Ricky's bedroom and Lester's garage.<ref name="impeccable 75">{{harvnb|Probst|Heuring|Holben|Thomson|2000|p=75}}</ref> The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts<U+2014>watching from Ricky's bedroom<U+2014>mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex.<ref name="chapter 22"/> Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 10}}</ref> The house interiors were filmed on the backlot, on location, and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed.<ref name="shohan"/> The inside of the Burnhams' home was shot at a house close to [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]] and [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Los Angeles; the inside of the Fitts' home was shot in the city's Hancock Park neighborhood.<ref name="impeccable 75"/> Ricky's bedroom was designed to be cell-like to suggest his "monkish" personality, while at the same time blending with the high-tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side. The production deliberately minimized the use of red, as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere. The Burnhams' home uses cool blues, while the Fitts' is kept in a "depressed military palette".<ref name="shohan"/>

Mendes' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided "a sparse, almost surreal feeling<U+2014>a bright, crisp, hard edged, near [[Ren<U+00E9> Magritte|Magritte]]-like take on American suburbia"; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers to empty the frame. He made Lester's fantasy scenes "more fluid and graceful",<ref name="kemp 26"/> and Mendes made minimal use of [[steadicam]]s, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams' dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He wanted to keep the tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table.{{#tag:ref|The shot references a similar one in ''[[Ordinary People]]''&nbsp;(1980). Mendes included several such homages to other films; family photographs in the characters' homes were inserted to give them a sense of history, but also as a nod to the way [[Terrence Malick]] used still photographs in ''[[Badlands]]''&nbsp;(1973).<ref name="chapter 2"/> A shot of Lester's jogging was a homage to ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''&nbsp;(1976) and Mendes watched several films to help improve his ability to evoke a "heightened sense of style": ''[[The King of Comedy (1983 film)|The King of Comedy]]''&nbsp;(1983), ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''&nbsp;(1979) and ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''&nbsp;(1968).<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 21}}</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref name="chapter 2"/> Mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts beats Ricky. Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a "kinetic&nbsp;... off balance energy". He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky's camcorder footage.<ref name="chapter 18">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 18}}</ref> It took Mendes a long time to get the quality of Ricky's footage to the level he wanted.<ref name="chapter 2"/> For the plastic bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air. The scene took four takes; two by the [[second unit]] did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|p=268}}</ref>

Mendes avoided using [[close-up]]s, as he believed the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted at the bottom of the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a {{convert|40|ft|m|sigfig=1|adj=on}} screen.<ref name="chapter 25">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 25}}</ref> Spielberg<U+2014>who visited the set a few times<U+2014>also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a "great idea" toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie."<ref name="stein">Stein, Ruthe (September&nbsp;12, 1999).

''American Beauty'' cost DreamWorks $15&nbsp;million to produce, slightly above their projected sum.<ref name="kemp 27">{{harvnb|Kemp|2000|p=27}}</ref> Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene.{{#tag:ref|The scene at the fast food outlet where Lester discovers Carolyn's affair.<ref name="chapter 22"/>|group="nb"}} And the actors played it way too big&nbsp;... It was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault&nbsp;... And everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.{{'"}}<ref name="weinraub">Weinraub, Bernard (September&nbsp;12, 1999). "The New Season / Film: Stage to Screen; A Wunderkind Discovers the Wonders of Film". ''The New York Times'': 271.</ref>

Mendes encouraged some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in bed beside Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, "I wanted that not just because it was funny&nbsp;... but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [Spacey] is so in control<U+2014>I wanted him to break through." Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot ten times.<ref name="stein"/> The production used small amounts of [[computer-generated imagery]]. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production,<ref name="chapter 4">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 4}}</ref> although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed.<ref name="chapter 5">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 5}}</ref> When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.<ref name="chapter 11">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 11}}</ref>

===Editing===
''American Beauty'' was edited by [[Christopher Greenbury]] and [[Tariq Anwar (film editor)|Tariq Anwar]]; Greenbury began in the position, but had to leave halfway through post-production because of a scheduling conflict with ''[[Me, Myself and Irene]]''&nbsp;(2000). Mendes and an assistant edited the film for ten days between the appointments.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|p=270}}</ref> Mendes realized during editing that the film was different to the one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a "much more whimsical&nbsp;... kaleidoscopic" film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines.<ref Name="kemp 25-26">{{harvnb|Kemp|2000|pages=25<U+2013>26}}</ref> In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit.<ref name="chapter 19"/> The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against [[chroma key|bluescreen]], but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical<U+2014>"like a [[Coen brothers]] movie"<U+2014>and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set.<ref name="chapter 2"/> The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father.<ref name="chapter 1"/> This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair were not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening<U+2014>and when the full scene plays out later<U+2014>Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt.<ref>{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 20}}</ref> The subsequent shot<U+2014>an aerial view of the neighborhood<U+2014>was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence.<ref name="chapter 2"/>

Mendes spent more time re-cutting the first ten minutes than the rest of the film taken together. He trialled several versions of the opening;<ref name="chapter 1"/> the first edit included bookend scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester's murder,<ref name="chapter 12">{{harvnb|Mendes|Ball|2000|loc=chapter 12}}</ref> but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing<ref name="chapter 1"/> because he felt they made the film lose its mystery,<ref>Staff (July&nbsp;7, 2000). {{"'}}Beauty' mark: DVD due with 3 hours of extras". ''The Hollywood Reporter''.</ref> and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production. Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film "into an episode of ''[[NYPD Blue]]''". Instead, he wanted the ending to be "a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution".<ref name="kemp 26">{{harvnb|Kemp|2000|p=26}}</ref> When Ball first saw a completed edit, it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they "didn't really register". He and Mendes argued,<ref name="kazan 35"/> but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely; Ball felt that without the scenes the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that "for all its darkness had a really romantic heart".<ref name="wolk"/>

===Cinematography===
[[Conrad Hall]] was not the first choice for director of photography; Mendes believed he was "too old and too experienced" to want the job, and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with. Instead, Mendes asked [[Frederick Elmes|Fred Elmes]], who turned the job down because he did not like the script.<ref name="lowenstein 259">{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|p=259}}</ref> Hall was recommended to Mendes by [[Tom Cruise]], because of Hall's work on ''[[Without Limits]]''&nbsp;(1998), which Cruise had executive produced. Mendes was directing Cruise's then-wife [[Nicole Kidman]] in the play ''[[The Blue Room (play)|The Blue Room]]'' during pre-production on ''American Beauty'',<ref name="impeccable 75"/> and had already [[storyboard]]ed the whole film.<ref name="fanshawe"/> Hall was involved for one month during pre-production;<ref name="impeccable 75"/> his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script, and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting Mendes.<ref name="probst 80">{{harvnb|Probst|2000|p=80}}</ref> Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals, which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals.<ref name="impeccable 75"/>

Hall's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked [[classicism]], to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences to take in the action. Hall and Mendes would first discuss the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary.<ref name="probst 80"/> In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by "painting in" the blacks and whites, before adding [[fill light]], which he reflected from [[rigid panel|beadboard]] or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill.<ref name="probst 81"/> Hall shot ''American Beauty'' in a [[Aspect ratio (image)|2.39:1 aspect ratio]] in the [[Super 35]] format, using [[List of motion picture film stocks#VISION color negative (ECN-2 process 1996<U+2013>2002)|Kodak Vision 500T 5279]] [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm film stock]].<ref name="impeccable 76"/> He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within.<ref name="chapter 5"/> He shot the whole film at the same [[T-stops|T-stop]] (T1.9);<ref name="impeccable 76">{{harvnb|Probst|Heuring|Holben|Thomson|2000|p=76}}</ref> given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects.<ref name="probst 81"/> He used [[Panavision cameras|Panavision Platinum]] cameras with the company's Primo series of [[prime lens|prime]] and [[zoom lens]]es. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and [[List of motion picture film stocks#EXR color negative (ECN-2 process 1989<U+2013>1996)|EXR 5248]] stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8&nbsp;inch [[Tiffen]] Black ProMist [[Photographic filter|filter]] for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its [[anamorphic format|anamorphic]] release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the [[Photon diffusion|diffusion]] from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35<U+2013>anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.<ref name="impeccable 76"/>

A shot where Lester and Ricky share a [[joint (cannabis)|cannabis joint]] behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light from the top of the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene".<ref name="impeccable 76"/> Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester.<ref name="probst 81">{{harvnb|Probst|2000|p=81}}</ref> He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.<ref name="probst 82">{{harvnb|Probst|2000|p=82}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Critically acclaimed, ''American Beauty'' was widely considered the best [[1999 in film|film of 1999]] by the American press; it received overwhelming praise, chiefly for Spacey, Mendes and Ball.<ref name="hentzi 46">{{harvnb|Hentzi|2000|p=46}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported, "No other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal raves."<ref>Chagollan, Steve (December&nbsp;15, 1999). "Noms Watch: American Beauty". ''Variety''.</ref> It was the best-received title at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF),<ref name="bow"/> where it won the People's Choice Award after a ballot of the festival's audiences.<ref>Klady, Leonard (September&nbsp;20, 1999). "Toronto auds tap 'Beauty{{'"}}. ''Variety''.</ref> TIFF's director, Piers Handling, said, "''American Beauty'' was the buzz of the festival, the film most talked about."<ref>Vlessing, Etan (September&nbsp;20, 1999). {{"'}}Beauty' counts at Toronto fest". ''The Hollywood Reporter''.</ref>

Writing in ''Variety'', Todd McCarthy said the cast ensemble "could not be better"; he praised Spacey's "handling of innuendo, subtle sarcasm and blunt talk" and the way he imbued Lester with "genuine feeling".<ref name="mccarthy">McCarthy, Todd (September&nbsp;13, 1999). "American Beauty Review". ''Variety''.</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said Spacey was at his "wittiest and most agile" to date,<ref name="maslin">Maslin, Janet (September&nbsp;15, 1999). "Dad's Dead, And He's Still a Funny Guy". ''The New York Times'': E1.</ref> and [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who "does reckless and foolish things [but who] doesn't deceive himself".<ref name="ebert">Ebert, Roger (September&nbsp;23, 1999). [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990924/REVIEWS/909240301/1023 "American Beauty"]. ''Chicago Sun-Times''.</ref> Kevin Jackson of ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of "both sap and hero".<ref name="jackson"/> Writing in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'', Gary Hentzi praised the actors,<ref name="hentzi 50">{{harvnb|Hentzi|2000|p=50}}</ref> but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts were stereotypes.<ref name="hentzi 47">{{harvnb|Hentzi|2000|p=47}}</ref> Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky, saying the latter was their "fantasy figure"<U+2014>a teenaged boy who's an absurdly wealthy artist able to "finance [his] own projects".<ref name="hentzi 49-50">{{harvnb|Hentzi|2000|pp=49<U+2013>50}}</ref> Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager, in particular with her "painfully familiar" attempts to "live up to an unworthy image of herself".<ref name="hentzi 46"/> Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal, but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable.<ref name="maslin"/> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the actors coped "faultlessly" with what were difficult roles; he called Spacey's performance "the energy that drives the film", saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester's not always being sympathetic. "Against considerable odds, we do like [these characters]," Turan concluded.<ref name="turan">Turan, Kenneth (September&nbsp;15, 1999). "American Beauty: The Rose's Thorns". ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref>

Maslin felt that Mendes directed with "terrific visual flair", saying his minimalist style balanced "the mordant and bright" and that he evoked the "delicate, eroticized power-playing vignettes" of his theater work.<ref name="maslin"/> Jackson said Mendes' theatrical roots rarely showed, and that the "most remarkable" aspect was that Spacey's performance did not overshadow the film. He said that Mendes worked the script's intricacies smoothly, to the ensemble's strengths, and staged the tonal shifts skillfully.<ref name="jackson"/> McCarthy believed ''American Beauty'' a "stunning card of introduction" for film d<U+00E9>butantes Mendes and Ball. He said Mendes' "sure hand" was "as precise and controlled" as his theater work. McCarthy cited Hall's involvement as fortunate for Mendes, as the cinematographer was "unsurpassed" at conveying the themes of a work.<ref name="mccarthy"/> Turan agreed that Mendes' choice of collaborators was "shrewd", naming Hall and Newman in particular. Turan suggested that ''American Beauty'' may have benefited from Mendes' inexperience, as his "anything's possible daring" made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided. Turan felt that Mendes' accomplishment was to "capture and enhance [the] [[dualism|duality]]" of Ball's script<U+2014>the simultaneously "caricatured&nbsp;... and painfully real" characters.<ref name="turan"/> Hentzi, while critical of many of Mendes and Ball's choices, admitted the film showed off their "considerable talents".<ref name="hentzi 50"/>

Turan cited Ball's lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone.<ref name="turan"/> McCarthy said the script was "as fresh and distinctive" as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue "tart" and said the characters<U+2014>Carolyn excepted<U+2014>were "deeply drawn". One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts' homosexuality, which he said evoked "hoary [[Sigmund Freud#Freud's ideas|Freudianism]]".<ref name="mccarthy"/> Jackson said the film transcended its clich<U+00E9>d setup to become a "wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy". He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with "unexpected nuance".<ref name="jackson"/> Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester's murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense.<ref name="hentzi 50"/> McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating "ironic counterpoint[s]" to the story.<ref name="mccarthy"/> Hentzi concluded that ''American Beauty'' was "vital but uneven"; he felt the film's examination of "the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives" was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela's dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony stood beside "the most enduring literary treatments" of the theme, such as ''[[Lolita]]''. Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were "hackneyed".<ref name="hentzi 46"/> McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a "starting point" from which to tell its "subtle and acutely judged tale".<ref name="mccarthy"/> Maslin agreed; she said that while it "takes aim at targets that are none too fresh", and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own "corrosive novelty".<ref name="maslin"/> Ebert awarded ''American Beauty'' four stars out of four,<ref name="ebert"/> and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex and surprising, concluding it was "a hell of a picture".<ref name="turan"/>

A few months after the film's release, reports of a backlash appeared in the American press,<ref name="backlash"/> and the years since have seen its critical regard wane.<ref>Brown, Joel (June&nbsp;22, 2001). "The Tube Has Few Intriguing Choices to Offer". ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'': 14.</ref><ref name="lowenstein 271-272">{{harvnb|Lowenstein|2008|pages=271<U+2013>272}}</ref> In 2005, ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' named ''American Beauty'' as one of 20 "most overrated movies of all time";<ref>Staff (September 2005). "The 20 most overrated movies of all time". ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' '''19''' (1): 103<U+2013>108.</ref> Mendes accepted the inevitability of the critical reappraisal, saying, "I thought some of it was entirely justified<U+2014>it was a little overpraised at the time."<ref name="lowenstein 271-272"/>

==Accolades==
{{main|List of accolades received by American Beauty}}
''American Beauty'' was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season. Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999, and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end-of-year lists.<ref name="topsy">Lyman, Rick (March&nbsp;27, 2000). "Early Oscars to Caine, Jolie and 'Topsy-Turvy{{'"}}. ''The New York Times''.</ref> The [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] and the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] named the film the best of 1999, but although the [[New York Film Critics Circle Awards|New York Film Critics Circle]], the [[National Society of Film Critics]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] recognized ''American Beauty'',<ref name="awards">[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/180738/American-Beauty/awards "American Beauty (1999)"]. New York Times Online. Retrieved January&nbsp;14, 2010.</ref> they gave their top awards to other films.<ref name="topsy"/> By the end of the year, reports of a critical backlash suggested ''American Beauty'' was the underdog in the race for Best Picture;<ref name="backlash">Kilday, Gregg (January&nbsp;8, 2001). "Road to best pic: An 'American' dream". ''Variety''.</ref> however, at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000, ''American Beauty'' won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture <U+2013> Drama|Best Film]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].<ref name="awards"/>

As the nominations for the [[72nd Academy Awards]] approached, a frontrunner had not emerged.<ref name="topsy"/> DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for ''American Beauty'' five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5,600 Academy Award voters. Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies. Although [[advertising mail|direct mail]] campaigning was prohibited, DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in "casual, comfortable settings" in voters' communities. The studio's candidate for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] the previous year, ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', lost to ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign. It hired three veteran consultants, who told the studio to "think small". Nancy Willen encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of ''American Beauty'', to set up displays of the film in the communities' bookstores, and to arrange a question-and-answer session with Mendes for the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]. Dale Olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in [[Beverly Hills]]<U+2014>home to many voters<U+2014>in addition to major newspapers. Olson arranged to screen ''American Beauty'' to about 1,000 members of the Actors Fund of America, as many participating actors were also voters. Bruce Feldman took Ball to the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of [[Anthony Hopkins]], meeting several voters who were in attendance.<ref>Wallace, Amy (March&nbsp;28, 2000). "Aggressive campaign may have helped 'Beauty's' win". ''[[The Journal Gazette]]''. (Reprinted from the ''Los Angeles Times''.)</ref>

In February 2000, ''American Beauty'' was nominated for eight Academy Awards; its closest rivals, ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' and ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'', received seven nominations each. In March 2000, the major industry labor organizations{{#tag:ref|The [[Writers Guild of America]], the [[Screen Actors Guild]], the [[Producers Guild of America]], the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] and the [[Directors Guild of America]].<ref name="topsy"/>|group="nb"}} all awarded their top honors to ''American Beauty''; perceptions had shifted<U+2014>the film was now favorite to dominate the Academy Awards.<ref name="topsy"/> ''American Beauty''{{'}}s closest rival for Best Picture was still ''The Cider House Rules'', from [[Miramax]]. Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns; DreamWorks bought 38% more advertising space in ''Variety'' than Miramax.<ref>Karger, Dave (March&nbsp;10, 2000). "Apple Juice". ''Entertainment Weekly'' (530).</ref> On March&nbsp;26, 2000, ''American Beauty'' won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Spacey), [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].<ref>Lyman, Rick (March&nbsp;28, 2000).
