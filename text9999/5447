'''''Arise''''' is the fourth studio album by [[Brazillian]] [[thrash metal]] band [[Sepultura]], released in 1991 by [[Roadrunner Records]]. It is considered a landmark in both the thrash and [[death metal]] genres: and ''[[Allmusic]]'' contributor Eduardo Rivadavia declared it "a classic of the death metal genre."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:d9fqxqy5ldde|title= ((( Arise > Overview )))|author= Rivadavia, Ed|publisher= [http://www.allmusic.com allmusic.com]|accessdate= 2008-06-02}}</ref> It is also considered their finest hour among longtime fans.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/biografias/038376-sepultura.html|title= Sepultura - Biografia|author= Kennedy, Hagen|date= 2006-04-06|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2008-06-02}}</ref>

The ''Arise'' tour (1990-1992) has been the group's longest yet, totalling 220 shows in 39 different countries.<ref name= barcinski90>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 90.</ref> During this trek ''Arise'' went gold in [[Indonesia]], making it their first [[Music recording sales certification|music industry certification]] ever.<ref name= bacinski109> Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 109.</ref> By the tour's end, ''Arise'' had achieved platinum sales worldwide.<ref name= sepsmill>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fifoxqr5ldke~T1|title= ((( Sepultura > Biography )))|author= Rivadavia, Ed|publisher= [http://www.allmusic.com allmusic.com]|accessdate= 2008-06-02}}</ref>

==Production==
In August 1990, the band travelled to [[Florida]], [[USA]] to work on ''Arise''. [[Scott Burns (producer)|Scott Burns]] reprised his role as their producer and engineer, and now with a major advantage: Sepultura were at his home base, [[Morrisound Recording|Morrisound]], a studio properly equipped to record their music style. Their label Roadrunner granted a [[$]]40,000 budget, which helped explain the album's improved production values. That allowed Igor and Burns, for example, a whole week to spend just testing the [[drum kit]]'s [[Drum set tuning|tunings]] and the proper [[microphone practice]] to record it.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 86.</ref>

==Musical style==
Although lead guitarrist [[Andreas Kisser]] stated that ''Arise'' "took a lot of the same direction" as their previous [[LP]], ''[[Beneath the Remains]]'', it was clear that their music had somehow changed.<ref name= aln97>{{cite album-notes|title= Arise|albumlink= Arise (album)|bandname= [[Sepultura]]|year= 1997|notestitle=|url=|first=Don|last=Kaye|pages=p. 10|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= [[New York City|New York]], [[NY]]}}</ref> Sepultura's usual breakneck pace became toned down a bit;<ref name= barcinski89>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 89.</ref> drummer [[Igor Cavalera]] started using [[Groove (music)|groove]]-laden rhythms; and the [[Max Cavalera]]/Kisser guitar duo experiment with different [[guitar tunings|tunings]] on some songs. According to [[heavy metal|metal]] specialist Don Kaye, ''Arise'' "represented the band taking their initial death/thrash sound to its logical conclusion."<ref name= aln97>{{cite album-notes|title= Arise|albumlink= Arise (album)|bandname= [[Sepultura]]|year= 1997|notestitle=|url=|first=Don|last=Kaye|pages=p. 10|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= [[New York City|New York]], [[NY]]}}</ref>  

''Arise'' also found the band opening up to non-metal influences.<ref name= barcinski89>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 89.</ref> [[The Young Gods]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten]] were already part of Sepultura's listening habits, and  slight touches of [[industrial music]] can be traced through the use of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] and [[sound effects]].<ref name= barcinski90>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 90.</ref> A trademark of a later phase&mdash;[[Latin percussion]] and "tribal" drumming&mdash;made its point of entry on the song "Altered State". The band's old love for [[hardcore punk]] started shining through on "Subtraction" and "Desperate Cry".<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, pages 47 & 89.</ref>

==Touring and promotion==
One day after finishing the recording of ''Arise'', the band did a small headlining tour with [[extreme metal]]lers [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]] and [[Sadus]].<ref name= codln97>{{cite album-notes|title= Cause of Death|albumlink= Cause of Death (album)
|bandname= [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]|year= 1997|notestitle= Cause of Death: A Personal History|url=|first=Phil|last=Alexander|pages=p. 05|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= [[New York City|New York]], [[NY]]}}</ref> That was the start of the longest promotional tour of Sepultura's career, a worldwide affair that would span to two full years.<ref name= barcinski90>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 90.</ref> In January 1991 they were invited to play for the [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] music festival [[Rock in Rio|Rock in Rio 2]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 91.</ref> Their performance was watched by a 70,000-strong crowd.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 93.</ref>

Before heading out of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura performed one more concert at [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], the country's largest city. It took place at Pra<U+00E7>a Charles Miller (in front of [[Est<U+00E1>dio do Pacaembu]]), on [[May 11th]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 94.</ref> Local [[military police]] expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six  people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was shot dead. A  week before, a young man was stabbed to death at a [[Ramones]] concert in S<U+00E3>o Paulo, during a brawl between [[Metalhead|headbanger]]s and [[skinheads]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 96.</ref> These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against [[rock music]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 97.</ref>

Sepultura's three-month tour with thrash metal grups [[Sacred Reich]] and [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]] was a critical success. For the first time ever they became the cover story of best-selling [[United Kingdom|British]] [[heavy metal]] magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and major [[pop music]] [[Weekly newspaper|weeklies]] such as ''[[Melody Maker]]''  and ''[[NME]]'' published long feature articles on the group. While in Spain Sepultura recorded their ''[[Under Siege (Live in Barcelona)|Under Siege]]'' video, which included their [[Barcelona]] concert and interview footage with all four members of the band.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 99.</ref> After Europe, they toured North America with [[grindcore]] pioneers [[Napalm Death]], [[NYC]] hardcore punk group [[Sick of It All]] and Sacred Reich.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 103.</ref> Sepultura wrapped up the year doing a brief [[Germany|German]] tour with [[NWOBHM]] legends M<U+00F6>torhead and [[Florida]] [[death metal]] group [[Morbid Angel]] in December.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 105.</ref> 

A [[remastered]] version of ''Arise'' was released by Roadrunner in 1997, with added notes by [[music critic]] Don Kaye and four [[bonus tracks]]: a [[cover version]] of [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]]'s "[[Orgasmatron (song)|Orgasmatron]]", two previously unreleased songs and a rough mix of "Desperate Cry".<ref name= aln97>{{cite album-notes|title= Arise|albumlink= Arise (album)|bandname= [[Sepultura]]|year= 1997|notestitle=|url=|first=Don|last=Kaye|pages=p. 10|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= [[New York City|New York]], [[NY]]}}</ref> Previously unavailable photos from the ''Arise'' era were also included in the expanded CD booklet.<ref>{{cite album-notes|title= Arise|albumlink= Arise (album)|bandname= [[Sepultura]]|year= 1997|notestitle=|url=|first=Don|last=Kaye|pages=p. 08-09|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= [[New York City|New York]], [[NY]]}}</ref>
