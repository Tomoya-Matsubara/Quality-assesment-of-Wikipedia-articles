'''Malvern College''' is a [[coeducational]] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] located on  a 250 acre (101 ha) campus near  the town centre of [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]] in England.<ref>[http://degruben.com/academia/316/malvern-college/ DeGruben Academia: Malvern College] Retrieved 2 August 2010</ref> Founded in 1865,<ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hereford/worcs/8614176.stm
BBC News 11 April 2010] Retrieved 2 August 2010 </ref> it was one of the twenty four [[Public school (UK)|Public Schools]] listed in the Public Schools Yearbook of 1889. Until 1992, the College was a [[secondary school]] for boys aged 13 to 18. Following a series of mergers, with private [[primary school]]s and a girl's school in the area, it has since become coeducational with pupils from 3 to 19 years old.<ref name="ofsted"/> In  2008 the school  had a total  of 600 pupils, of which  around 480 were boarders aged 12 - 19.<ref name="ofsted"/>
The school is known for its innovative approaches to education and for sports. Among its alumni are at least two [[Prime Minister]]s,<ref name="BBC2">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hereford/worcs/8612803.stm BBC News 10 April  2010 Retrieved 2 August 2010</ref> 
two [[Nobel Laureate]]s and an Olympic Gold medalist. The novelist [[C. S. Lewis]], author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' was also a former student of the school. It is a member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and of the [[Rugby Group]] of prestigious British independent schools. An Ofsted report  following  a February  2010 inspection rated the school's boardiing  facilities with  a Grade 2 (good).<ref name="ofsted"/>

[[Image:Maincollege.jpg|thumb|left|Main College in snow]]
[[Image:Malvern College Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|The College chapel with the Porter's Lodge and the Malvern Hills in the background]]
Set in the [[Malvern Hills]], the school's location owes much to Malvern's emergence in the nineteenth century as a fashionable spa resort, appreciated for its unpolluted air and the healing qualities of its famous [[Malvern water|spring water]].

The school opened its doors for the first time in January 1865. Initially, there were only about twenty four boy  pupils, around six teachers and two [[boarding house|houses]].<ref name="ofsted">[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxcare_reports/download/(id)/222330/(as)/SC043042_SC.pdf Ofsted inspection  report February  2008] Retrieved 2 August 2010</ref> Expansion was rapid and in 1877, there were 290 boys and six Houses, and by  the end of the 1890s the school had around  600 boys in  10 boarding  houses.<ref name="ofsted"/> Further expansion of pupil numbers and buildings continued between the end of the [[First World War|Great War]] in 1918 and the start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939.

During  [[World War  II]] the College premises were requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] between October 1939 and July 1940, when the school was temporarily  relocated to [[Blenheim Palace]]. In 1942, its premises were again needed for governmental use, on this occasion by the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|TRE]] and, from May 1942 to July 1946, the school was housed with [[Harrow School]]. [[QinetiQ]], a private sector successor to the government's original research facility, is still sited on former College land.<ref name="Our History">[http://www.malcol.net/general-information/our-history/ Our History]. Malvern College official website. Retrieved 15 May 2010.</ref>

Having traditionally been a school for boys aged from 13 to 18 years old, in 1992, it merged with Ellerslie Girls<U+2019> School and Hillstone [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] to become [[coeducational]] with pupils from 3 to 18 years old.<sup>[http://www.malvern-college.co.uk/prep/welcome.shtml]</sup> In September 2008, the College's Prep School merged with [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|The Downs]] prep school on the latter's nearby site in [[Colwall]], [[Herefordshire]] to form ''The Downs, Malvern College Prep School''.<ref>[http://www.thedowns.org.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=66 The Downs]  Retrieved 2 August  2010</ref>

The year 2008, also, saw the start of a multi-million pound development scheme<ref>[http://www.malcol.net/general-information/the-development-plan/  Malvern College] retrieved 2 August 2010</ref> that included a new Sports Complex, new athletics and viewing facilities at the pitches and two new Boarding Houses. The Sports Complex and new houses were opened in October 2009 by [[Prince Andrew|HRH Prince Andrew]], the Duke of York. Ellerslie House was opened for girls, commemorating the eponymous former girls' school, and the other new House has become the new permanent residence for the boys of No. 7.<ref>[http://www.malcol.net/general-information/gala-dinner-auction/ Opening Celebrations]. Malvern College official website. Retrieved 15 May 2010.</ref>

==Sport==

The school has a strong sporting tradition. For boy's sports, some Malvernians would consider the College to be best known as a [[football (soccer)|football]] school although its [[cricket]] sides have also produced players who have gone on to play at international level. Traditionally, sport for boys used to be split between the original 'major sports' of football, cricket, and rackets ([[rugby football|rugby]] was added later), and 'minor sports'. Colours were awarded for each major sport, as appropriate. After 1995, the distinction between 'major sport' and 'minor sport' was removed. The girls' main sports are hockey and [[lacrosse]] in the winter, lacrosse and netball in the Lent Term and tennis and [[rounders]] in the summer.

The College also plays a multitude of other sports such as [[Rackets (sport)|Rackets]], [[Fives]], Athletics, Tennis, Squash, Croquet, Basketball, Badminton and Polo. Some boy's hockey and girl's football are played.<ref>[http://www.malcol.net/sports/ Sports]. Malvern College official website. Retrieved 15 May 2010.</ref>

On October 16, 2009, a new sports complex and hospitality suite was opened by [[Prince Andrew]]. The opening was attended by several well known sports personalities including athlete [[Dame Kelly Holmes]], cricketers [[Michael Vaughan]] and [[Graham Gooch]], footballer [[Peter Shilton]], rugby union player [[Jason Leonard]], athlete [[Christina Boxer]] and hockey player [[Rachel Walker (field hockey)|Rachel Walker]].<ref>[http://www.cricketworld.com/countries/england/community_cricket/article/?aid=22082 Stars To Open Malvern College Sports Complex]. www.cricketworld.com. 2nd October 2009.

==Curriculum==

While academic success is considered important, emphasis is also placed on the all-round development of the individual rather than on academic results alone.<ref>[http://www.malcol.net/general-information/mission-statement/ Mission Statement].

==Houses==

A House is a component of the school community and a place where pupils reside and engage in private study. Normally, a pupil remains at his chosen House until he leaves the school. Each house has its own ''colours''. Competitions are regularly arranged between the Houses in a range of academic, artistic and sporting activities. With the exceptions of School House and Ellerslie House, the eleven houses at Malvern are named with  numbers 1 to 9,  a system which used to be used at [[Roedean School]], a girl's school founded by the sisters of the [[List of Old Malvernians|Old Malvernian]] judge [[Paul Ogden Lawrence|Sir Paul Ogden Lawrence]].

==Events==

;Commemoration Day
The main social event of the school calendar Commemoration Day, or "Commem" as it is known in the school, celebrates the founding of the school. A service is held where prizes are awarded. A cricket match then takes place between the 1st cricket XI and the Free Foresters. The inter-house Athletics competition and the Summer Concert take place on the Friday before Commem. It is held on the Saturday of Half-term in the [[Summer term]].

;the CVS Ball
The School Council organises a charity ball,  a [[black tie]] themed  event that takes place in the 5th week of every  Autumn Term.  A similar event called ''The Autumn Ball'' is held for the Lower School.

;the inter-house Singing Competition
This is held annually in the summer term. It is one of the most significant inter-house events on the school social calendar.

;The Ledder
The Ledder, or Ledbury Run, is a {{convert|7.5|mi|km|sing=on}} cross country race that starts in  the town of [[Ledbury]], goes over the Malvern Hills and finishes on the Senior, the main cricket pitch in the centre of the College. The first 9 runners receive Ledder Caps. In its early days there was no organised route and pupils simply had to get back to college as fast as they could.
[[Image:Remembrancesunday.jpg|thumb|right|St. George and the Quad on Remembrance Sunday]]

;Remembrance Sunday
On the Sunday closest to the 11th of November, known as [[Remembrance Sunday]], the entire college assembles in front of St. George to await a procession of parents, alumni, guests and teachers. Two minutes silence is followed by [[The Last Post]] and a reading. Representatives of the student body (the Senior Chapel Prefect, who is the Head Boy or Girl) and of the Old Malvernian Society then place wreaths at the foot of St. George. A memorial service follows in the chapel for the more than 400 Malvernians who lost their lives in the [[Great War]].

==Carmen Malvernense==

The school song was written and composed by two masters, [[M. A. Bayfield]] and [[R. E. Lyon]]. Although not sung for the past decade it has recently been revived and was sung at the 2008 Commem.

:Exultemus, O sodales,
:Iam cessare fas novales,
:Paululum laxemus mentes,
:Dulcem, domum repententes,
:Age soror iuxta fratrem,
:Celebremus Almam Matrem,
:Quae nos ornat, haec ornanda,
:Quae nos amat, adamanda.

The same song became the school song of [[Eastbourne College]] when Bayfield became headmaster there in 1895.<ref>[http://www.eastbourne-college.co.uk/TheArts/Music/Documents/Music-history-18Aug08.pdf A history of music at Eastbourne College from its foundation in 1867], 18th August 2008, pp.9. www.eastbourne-college.co.uk. Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref>

==Innovations==

In 1963 the college was the first independent school to have a [[language lab]]oratory. Under the direction of John Lewis<ref name="tes.co.uk">[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=81010 ''Education for life'', TES Magazine, 30 December 1994, Sir Christopher Ball.] retrieved </ref>, a former master, it pioneered  [[Nuffield Foundation|Nuffield Physics]]<ref>[http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/ The Nuffield Foundation]/</ref><ref>[http://www.practicalphysics.org/ Nuffield Practical Physics] Retrieved </ref> in the 1960s, ''Science in Society''<ref>[http://www.scienceinsocietyadvanced.org/ Science in Society] Retrieved </ref><ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/13/6/001 Science in Society, by John L Lewis, Physics Education, Volume 13, Issue 6 (September 1978)] Retrieved </ref> in the 1970s, and the ''Diploma of Achievement''<ref name="tes.co.uk"/> in the 1990s. At the beginning of the 1990s, Malvern College became one of the first schools in Britain to offer the choice between the [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate]] and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] in the [[Sixth Form]].<ref name="Our History"/> The school was one of the first boy's public schools to become coeducational for pupils from 3 to 18 years.<ref name="Our History"/>

Each summer the staff and some older pupils run a summer school, Young Malvern, which incorporates many sports, activities and learning experiences, and with [[Dulwich College]], Malvern College is one of the two schools in the country to offer [[Debate|Debating]] in the curriculum and pupils participate in regional and national competitions including the ''Debating Matters'' competition and the ''Three Counties Tournament''.<ref>[http://www.debatingmatters.com/institutions/institution/malvern_college/ Debating Matters Competition] Retrieved 16 May 2010.</ref><ref name="Debating">[http://www.malcol.net/academic-careers/debating/ Debating].

==Notable alumni==
{{See also|List of Old Malvernians}}
The school's alumni are known as ''Old Malvernians'', or ''OM's''. The Malvernian Society holds many  annual reunions and events and Old Malvernians, including former pupils of The Downs,  Hillstone, and  Ellerslie schools which  have merged with Malvern College, benefit from a remission in fees for their own children.<ref>[http://www.malcol.net/old-malvernians/ Old Malvernians web page] Retrieved 6 December 2009</ref> Other Old Malvernian clubs and societies include OM Lodge, Court Games, Golf, Sailing, Shooting, the [[Old Malvernians Cricket Club]], and the [[Old Malvernians F.C.|Old Malvernians Football Club]], a record breaking club competing in the [[Arthurian League]].

At least two of the school's former pupils have become [[Nobel Laureates]]. Some past pupils are royalty from various nations, and others have become Heads of State, high ranking military officers, leading jurists, authors, and famous sportspeople.

==Fire damage==

In  2010 part of the school suffered serious damage when fire  broke out on 10  April  in  one of the boardihg houses.<ref name="BBC"/> The 1871 Grade 2 listed building which was the boarding house for 55 girls and living accommodation  of the housemistress and her family,<ref>[http://www.malverngazette.co.uk/archive/2010/07/11/Latest+T%28wn_news_latest%29/8265196.College_house_set_to_rise_from_the_ashes/ Tarik  Al Rasheed, ''Malvern Gazette'' 11 July  2010] Retrieved 2 August 2010</ref> was almost  completely  destroyed.<ref name="BBC2">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hereford/worcs/8612803.stm BBC News 10 April 2010] Retrieved 2 August  2010</ref>
