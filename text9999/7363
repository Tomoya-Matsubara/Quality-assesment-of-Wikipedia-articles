== History ==

=== Founding ===

In 1923, consul Bruno Lucander founded Finnair as '''Aero O/Y''' (''Aero Ltd''). The company code, "AY", originates from this; AY stands for Aero Yhti<U+00F6> which means "company" in Finnish. Lucander had previously run the Finnish operations of the Estonian airline Aeronaut. In mid-1923 he concluded an agreement with [[Junkers]] Flugzeugwerke AG to provide aircraft and technical support in exchange for a 50% ownership in the new airline. The charter establishing the company was signed in [[Helsinki]] on  12 September 1923, and the company was entered into the trade register on 11 December 1923. The first flight was on 20 March 1924 from Helsinki to [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] on a [[Junkers F.13]] aircraft equipped with floats. The [[seaplane]] service ended in December 1936 following the construction of the first [[Airport|aerodromes]] in Finland.

=== World War II ===

Air raids on [[Helsinki]] and other Finnish cities made [[World War II]] a difficult period for the airline. Half the fleet was requisitioned by the [[Finnish Air Force]] and it is estimated that, during the [[Winter War]] of 1939 and 1940, half of the airline's passengers were children being evacuated to [[Sweden]].

=== Immediate postwar period ===

The Finnish government acquired a majority stake in the company in 1946 and re-established services to [[Europe]] in November 1947, initially using the [[Douglas DC-3]]. In 1953, the airline began branding itself as Finnair. The [[Convair 440]] twin-engined pressurised airliner was acquired from January 1953 and these faster aircraft were operated on the company's longer routes as far as [[London Heathrow Airport|London]].

=== Jet Age (1970s) ===

In 1961, Finnair joined the jet age by adding [[Rolls-Royce Avon]]-engined [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]s to its fleet. These were later exchanged with the manufacturer for [[Pratt & Whitney JT8D]]-engined Super Caravelles. In 1962, Finnair acquired a 27% controlling interest in a private Finnish airline, [[Karair|Kar-Air]]. Finnair Oy became the company's official name on 25 June 1968. In 1969, it took possession of its first [[United States|U.S. made]] jet, a [[Douglas DC-8]]. The first transatlantic service to [[New York City|New York]] was inaugurated on 15 May 1969.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In the 1960s Finnair's head office was in [[Helsinki]].<ref>"World Airline Directory." ''[[Flight International]]''. 2 April 1964. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200902.html?search=%22British%20Eagle%22%20%22head%20office%22 511].</ref>

Finnair received its first widebody aircraft in 1975, two [[DC-10|DC-10-30]] planes. The first of these arrived on 4 February 1975 and entered service on 14 February 1975, flying between Helsinki and Las Palmas.

In 1979, Finnair established a subsidiary company [[Finnaviation]] for domestic operations, with a 60% stake.<ref>[http://www.finnairgroup.com/konserni/konserni_14_3.html Finnair]. Finnairgroup.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-03.</ref>

=== Expansion (1980s) ===

In 1983, Finnair became the first operator to fly non-stop from [[Western Europe]] to [[Japan]] operating Helsinki-Tokyo flights with one [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30ER]]. Until then, flights had to go via Moscow (Aeroflot, SAS, BA) or Anchorage (most carriers)<ref>[http://www.pprune.org/archive/index.php/t-247940.html Flying over not so friendly Countries [Archive&#93; - PPRuNe Forums]. Pprune.org (1967-11-04). Retrieved on 2010-11-03.</ref> due to Soviet airspace restrictions, but Finnair circumvented these by flying directly north from Helsinki, over the North Pole and back south through the [[Bering Strait]], avoiding the Soviet airspace.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%202900.html 1986 | 2900 | Flight Archive].

Retrieved on 2010-11-03.</ref> The routes through Soviet airspace and with a stopover in Moscow also took 13 hours, but flights with a stopover at Anchorage took up to 16 hours, giving Finnair a competitive edge. In the spring of 1986, Soviet regulators finally cleared the way for Air France and Japan Airlines to fly nonstop Paris-Tokyo services over Soviet airspace, putting Finnair at a disadvantage.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%200806.html 1986 | 0806 | Flight Archive]. Flightglobal.com (1986-04-05). Retrieved on 2010-11-03.</ref>

Finnair launched a Helsinki-[[Beijing]] route in 1988, making Finnair the first Western European carrier to fly non-stop between Europe and [[China]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1989, Finnair became the launch customer for the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]], the first of which was delivered on 7 December 1990. The first revenue service with the MD-11 took place on 20 December 1990, with OH-LGA operating a flight from Helsinki to [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].

=== Operations on subsidiary airlines (1990s&ndash;2000s) ===

In 1997, the subsidiaries Kar-Air and Finnaviation became wholly owned by Finnair, and were integrated into the mainline operations.

On 25 September 1997, the company's official name was changed to Finnair [[Oyj]].

In 1999, Finnair joined the [[Oneworld]] airline alliance.

In 2001, Finnair reused the name "Aero" when establishing [[Aero Airlines]], a subsidiary airline based in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].

In 2003, Finnair acquired ownership of the Swedish [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airline]], [[FlyNordic]], which operated mainly within Scandinavia. In 2007, Finnair sold all its shares in FlyNordic to [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]]. As part of the transaction, Finnair acquired 4.8% of the latter company, becoming its third largest shareholder.

=== Labour disputes and restructuring (2006&ndash;present) ===

Finnair has suffered from many labour disputes in this period, resulting from cost-cutting measures prompted by competition from budget airlines.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Headquarter Finnair.jpg|thumb|Finnair's previous head office, Tietotie 11, at [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport]]]]

In 2013, Finnair opened its new head office, known as House of Travel and Transportation (or "HOTT"), on what used to be a car park right next to its previous head office located in Tietotie 11, in the grounds of [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport]]. The construction of HOTT began in July 2011 and finished on time in June 2013. The previous head office had been in use since 1994, then replacing a head office located in Helsinki city centre.<ref name="HQMove">"[http://www.finnairgroup.com/group/group_14_4_r.html?Id=1045220398.html 1994]."

== Services ==

=== Finnair Plus === <!-- This section is linked from [[Finnair]] -->

Finnair Plus is Finnair's frequent-flyer programme. Passengers are awarded points based on the type and class of flight flown. Once enough miles are banked into the passenger's account, a membership tier (Basic, Silver, Gold or Platinum) is awarded. There is a Junior tier exclusively for minors. Silver, Gold, and Platinum members have privileges such as premium check-in desks and priority boarding.

Finnair offers frequent-flyer partnerships with [[Flybe Nordic]] in addition to those in the [[Oneworld]] alliance:

In addition to earning points on flights with Finnair and its partner airlines, Finnair Plus members can earn points through various hotel and car rental partners in Finland and around the world along with other service partners.

=== Finnair lounges ===

Finnair operates lounges at two airports:

* [[Helsinki-Vantaa Airport]]
* [[Stockholm-Arlanda Airport]]

The remaining international destinations are served with contract lounges.

Finnair's English-language in-flight magazine, ''Blue Wings'', is published 10 times per year by the Finnish media group [[Sanoma]]. The first edition of ''Blue Wings'' magazine was published in 1980. There are domestic and international [[newspaper]]s on all flights and magazines on long-haul flights in business class.

=== Meals and drinks ===

On most European flights, a cold salad or sandwich is served, together with non-alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages and additional food items are available for purchase. Domestic flights as well as shorter European flights have snacks for sale and free non-alcoholic beverages. Business class offers warm meals and free beverages, including alcohol. On most Intercontinental flights there is a choice of meals in economy class. In inter-continental business class on most Airbus aircraft (excluding those with fully lie-flat seats), there is a dedicated snack bar.<ref name="Finnair : Travel">[http://www.finnair.fi/finnaircom/wps/portal/finnair/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy Finnair : Travel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Livery and uniforms ==

=== Livery ===

[[File:Finnair A319 retrojet.jpg|thumb|Finnair in retro livery]]

The company revealed a new livery in December 2010. Major changes include a restyled and larger lettering on the body, repainting of the engines in white, and a reversal of the color scheme for the tail fin favoring a white background with a blue stylized logo. The outline of the globe was also removed from the tail fin.<ref name="See our new plane">[http://www.finnair.com/finnaircom/wps/portal/finnair/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKL9443s3AFSYGYzp76kShCLvHO3gihoNS8eE-_EH1vfV-P_NxU_QD9gtzQiHJHR0UAjDZmwQ!!/# ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

Finnair has also used special liveries, including the "Moomins" and "Santa Claus", 1950s retro livery, Angry Birds and [[Oneworld]].

=== Uniform ===

Finnair's previous cabin crew uniform was ranked as the fifth most stylish uniform by the French Bon Voyage magazine.<ref>{{fi icon}} [http://www.finnair.com/finnaircom/wps/portal/finnair/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLD403MfEDSZnFe8c7e-pHgmgLd1eIkEu8szeakHe8SyhEyNUALuKDqSgYIuRlDBEJhSpCsi8Uah-SkGu8WwiGKoh9oSD7fD3yc1P1g_S99QP0C3JDoSCi3NFRUREA68Z3OA!!/delta/base64xml/L3dJdyEvd0ZNQUFzQUMvNElVRS82X1VfNDRP Miehist<U+00F6>]. Finnair. Retrieved on 2010-11-03.</ref> The current uniform was designed by Ritva-Liisa Pohjalainen and launched in December 2011. Finnair has codes to indicate the rank of crew member: one stripe in the sleeve means normal [[Flight attendant|cabin attendant]] and three stripes a purser. Additionally, female pursers have a white vertical stripe on their dresses or blouses. Finnair requires its cabin crew to wear gloves during take off and landing for safety reasons as well as female crew to switch high heels for boots during winter operations.

== Incidents and accidents ==

The company's only fatal accidents to date are the two DC-3 accidents in 1961 and 1963.
