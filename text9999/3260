==Early career==

He started his career in his native South Africa at [[Supersport United]], before transferring to [[Manning Rangers]] where he won the golden boot during the [[1997<U+2013>98 Premier Soccer League|1997<U+2013>98 Premier Soccer League season]] with 11 goals.

==Waitakere United==
He would move next to New Zealand, with ambitions to play for [[New Zealand Knights]] in the newly formed Australian/New Zealand [[A-League]]. However this never eventuated, and he signed with new [[New Zealand Football Championship]] team [[Waitakere United]]. This would ultimately be a successful move, scoring 15 goals in the 21 rounds, and earning the Golden Boot.<ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/cda/tvnz/sport/sport_soccer_stats_skin/stat_count/101294/Goal 2004-2005 NZFC goalscorers tally]</ref>

==Auckland City FC==
At the end of what was a good debut season with Waitakere United, he made the move to [[Auckland City FC]]. He made an immediate impact for the Auckland Club, socring frequently for the club in both the [[New Zealand Football Championship|NZFC]] and the [[Oceania Champions League]]. 

In 2008 he shocked the New Zealand footballing community, when it was revealed that he had been battling with [[cancer]] for 3 years, which would explain the 3 months he spent on the sideline.  He had initially been worried that it would interfere with his claims for permanent residency and New Zealand Citezenship, but was treated and given the all-clear by doctors and made his comeback in a 4-1 win against [[Canterbury United]].<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/284634 Jordan reveals long battle with Cancer]</ref>

His most notable appearances for the club were in the [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] & [[2009 FIFA Club World Cup]], in which Auckland City finished 5th out of 7th, surprising many onlookers wordwide. It was the best result any New Zealand or Oceania club had finished in the tournement, which plays host to each confederations best teams. 

On Friday, 19 March 2010, Jordan announced his retirements from all levels of Domestic and International football, citing ongoing knee injuries. Jordan hadn't played a full game since the 2009 Club World Cup, and he felt it the right time to retire, after what he conceded was an ultimately successful career.<ref>[http://www.aucklandcityfc.com/news/article.asp?ID=49 Jordan calls it a day]</ref>
