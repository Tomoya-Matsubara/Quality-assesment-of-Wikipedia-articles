'''The Oliver Typewriter Company''' was a [[typewriter]] manufacturer headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].  The Oliver Typewriter was the first effective "visible print" typewriter, meaning text was visible to the typist as it was entered.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.boulderclassifieds.com/aboutus/history.html |title = Looking into our Past |author = Taylor, Carol  |publisher = Daily Camera Librarian | date = November 1999 | accessdate= 2007-11-11}}</ref>  Oliver typewriters were marketed heavily for home use, utilizing local distributors and sales on credit.  Oliver produced more than one million machines between 1895 and 1928 and licensed its designs to several international firms. 

[[Competition|Competitive pressure]] and financial troubles resulted in the company's [[liquidation]] in 1928.  The company<U+2019>s assets were purchased by investors who formed The British Oliver Typewriter Company, which manufactured and licensed the machines until its own closure in the late 1950s.  The last Oliver typewriter was produced in 1959.

==History==
[[Image:Thomas Oliver.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Thomas Oliver]]
===Thomas Oliver===
Thomas Oliver was born in [[Woodstock, Ontario]], [[Canada]] on [[August 1]] [[1852]].  Having become interested in religion, Oliver moved to [[Monticello, Iowa| Monticello]], [[Iowa]] after the death of his mother, to serve as a [[Methodist]] minister.  During that time Oliver designed and developed his first typewriter, made from strips of [[tin]] cans, as a means of producing more legible sermons.<ref name="etc">{{cite web |url = http://etceterarehr1.googlepages.com/ETC.06.pdf |title = The Unknown Oliver | author = Rehr, Darryl | publisher= [http://staff.xu.edu/~polt/typewriters/etc.html ETCetera] &ndash; Magazine of the Early Typewriter Collectors Association |date = February 1989 | pages = pp. 1, 4<U+2013>5 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-11-11}}</ref> He was awarded his first typewriter patent, US Patent No. 450,107, on [[April 7]] [[1891]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=0450107.PN.&OS=PN/0450107&RS=PN/0450107 |title = United States Patent: 0450107 | publisher= United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate= 2007-12-28}}</ref>  Oliver resigned his ministry and moved to [[Epworth, Iowa]], where he found investors willing to provide $15,000 of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], and leased a building in which to manufacture his machines.

While visiting Chicago to promote the machine, Oliver encountered businessman Delavan Smith, who became interested in the typewriter and bought the stock held by the Iowa investors.  Oliver was given a 65% interest in the company and retained to continue development of the typewriter, at an annual salary of $3,000.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://etceterarehr1.googlepages.com/ETC.07.pdf |format=[[PDF]]|title= More on Reverend Oliver ... | author = Rehr, Darryl |publisher= ETCetera &ndash; Magazine of the Early Typewriter Collectors Association |date= May 1989 |pages = pp. 8<U+2013>9 |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> Oliver died suddenly of heart disease on [[February 9]] [[1909]], aged 56.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B02E1D91031E733A25753C1A9649C946897D6CF |title=Thomas Oliver |work=The New York Times |date=[[February 10]] [[1909]] |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

===Illinois years===
The Oliver Typewriter Company had begun operating in 1895, with its headquarters on the ninth floor of a building on the corner of Clark and Randolph Street in Chicago.  Manufacturing moved from Iowa to [[Woodstock, Illinois]] in 1896, when the City of Woodstock donated a vacant factory once used by the Wheeler and Tappan Company on the condition that the Oliver Typewriter Company remain there at least five years.<ref>{{cite book| last = Baker | first = Nancy L. | title = Woodstock | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | date = 2006 | pages = p. 33 | isbn = 0738540803}}</ref>  Manufacturing was divided into six departments: type bar, carriage, assembly, tabulators and adjustment, inspection and an aligning room.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~business/bhcweb/publications/BEHprint/v018/p0119-p0128.pdf |title = Product Design and Cost Considerations: Clock, Watch, and Typewriter Manufacturing in the 19th Century |author = Hoke, Donald |publisher= Outagamie Museum |format=[[PDF]]|accessdate= 2007-11-11}}</ref>  The company's headquarters moved to [[Oliver Building (Chicago)|the Oliver Building]], now a Chicago landmark on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], when it was completed in 1907.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/O/OliverBuilding.html |title=Chicago Landmarks |publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

Starting in 1899, the company established sales networks by encouraging customers to become local distributors.  This method of marketing relied on word of mouth and emphasized sales made directly to neighbors ([[door-to-door]]) and, after 1905, sales on credit. In response to increased competition in the late 1910s, however, the company eliminated its network of local salesman and used the resulting savings in [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to reduce the typewriter's $100 price by half.<ref name="etc21"/>  Sales increased and, at its peak, the company's labor force of 875 was producing 375 machines daily.<ref name="etc"/>

In addition to its offices in Illinois, the company had branch offices in [[Baltimore]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Cleveland]], [[Kansas City]], [[Minneapolis]], [[New York City]], [[Omaha]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Seattle]], all of which closed when Oliver shifted to [[mail order]] sales in March 1917.  A minor [[recession]] in 1921&ndash;22 caused a large number of customers to [[Default (finance)|default]] on their payments, resulting in the [[repossession]] of their typewriters.  The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, the [[board of directors]] voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.<ref name="etc"/>

===British Oliver Typewriter Company===
In 1928, the Oliver Typewriter Company was sold to investors who formed the British Oliver Typewriter Company in [[Croydon]], [[England]].<ref name="etc"/>  Production of Oliver<U+2019>s original, three-rowed keyboard design was discontinued in 1931, when the company began to produce a rebranded model of the <U+201C>Fortuna<U+201D> typewriter, a four-rowed [[Germany|German]] design.  In 1935, the company began to produce the Halda-Norden standard typewriter, another licensed design, as model No. 20.  The company, however, had to retool its machines and return to the original Oliver design when the British government placed large orders for the three-rowed No. 15 at the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref name="beeching">{{cite book| last = Beeching | first = Wilfred A. | title = Century of the Typewriter | publisher = St. Martin's Press | date = 1974 | pages = pp. 206-208}}</ref>  

Production of the No. 20 resumed around 1947, at which time the company began to license the Oliver name to several [[Europe]]an manufacturing companies.<ref name="adler">{{cite book| last = Adler | first = Michael H. | title = The Writing Machine | publisher = George Allen & Unwin Ltd. | date = 1973 | pages = p. 322 | isbn = 004652004X}}</ref>   The standard desktop machine was eventually discontinued in favor of portable models; the company began to sell a German design, the Siemag Standard,  as the Oliver standard.  In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron Typewriter Company, previously the Barlock Typewriter Company, of [[Nottingham]].  The licensing ventures were not ultimately successful, and the company's machine tools were transferred to a factory in Germany.<ref name="beeching"/>  Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.geocities.com/wbd641/oliver.html |publisher= geocities.com/wbd641|title = Oliver portables and relatives | author = Davis, Will |accessdate= 2007-11-11}}</ref>

==Typewriters==
[[Image:Oliver Typewriter No. 5.JPG|thumb|255px|right|An Oliver model No.5 with pencil that, when lowered, could draw lines or tables.]]
===Design===
The general design of Oliver typewriters remained mostly unchanged throughout the company's history.<ref name="etc21"/> The Olivers are "down strike" typewriters, meaning the [[typebar]]s strike the [[platen]] (also know as the roller) from above, rather than from below ("up strike"), or from the front ("front strike").  Unlike the "up strike" method, which prints text out of sight on the underside of the platen, the "down strike" is a "visible print" design, meaning the full page is visible to the typist as the text is being entered.  The relatively greater striking power of the "down strike" design led Olivers to be preferred for specialty uses, such as [[stencil]] cutting or "[[manifold]]ing" (copying using [[carbon paper]]).<ref name="successor">{{cite book| last = Mares | first = George Carl | title = The History of the Typewriter: Successor to the Pen | publisher = Post-Era Books | date = 1985 | isbn = 0911160876 | pages = pp. 114, 171 }}</ref>  The "front strike" method, a competing "visible print" design, was patented at around the same time (1889&ndash;91), but an effective machine that did not interfere with the typist<U+2019>s line of sight was not available until 1897, when the [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood No. 1]] appeared on the market, about three years after the introduction of the Oliver No. 1.<ref name="Rutherford">{{cite web |url = http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article010105.html |title = The User-friendly Typewriter |author = Campbell-Kelly, Martin | date = December 2005 | publisher = The Rutherford Journal | accessdate= 2007-11-11}}</ref>

The Oliver<U+2019>s typebars are bent in a bow (forming an inverted "U" shape) and rest in "towers" on the sides of the typewriter.  This design limited the machine to a three-row [[QWERTY]] keyboard, as the typebars were stacked such that they grew progressively larger as more were added.  The size and usability implications of adding additional keys, and thus more typebars, precluded the addition of a fourth keyboard row dedicated to numbers.<ref name="Rutherford"/>  Although a four-row [[prototype]] was designed in 1922, it was shelved due to the company<U+2019>s financial troubles at that time.<ref name="etc"/>  The No. 20, No. 21 and portable models produced by the British Oliver Typewriter Company had four-row keyboards.

===Color===
Oliver typewriters were finished with olive green paint or [[nickel]]-plating and white or black keyboards, depending on customer preference.  Beginning with model No. 3, machines were painted green except some variants to be exported to warm or damp regions, which were [[Chrome plating|chrome-plated]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://etceterarehr2.googlepages.com/ETC.33.pdf |title = Not Your Ordinary Oliver | author = Lewis, John | publisher= [http://staff.xu.edu/~polt/typewriters/etc.html ETCetera] &ndash; Magazine of the Early Typewriter Collectors Association |date = December 1995 | pages = p. 3 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate= 2008-02-12}}</ref>  The color was changed from green to black on the introduction of model No.&nbsp;11.<ref name="etc21"/>  Oliver typewriters made for the British [[Allies of World War II|war effort]] were supplied with a "war finish".<ref name="beeching"/>
