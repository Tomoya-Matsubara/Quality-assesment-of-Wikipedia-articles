'''Withdrawal of [[Union Public Service Commission]]<U+2019>s <U+2018>discriminatory proforma<U+2019>'''

Dr Singh challenged [[Union Public Service Commission]]<U+2019>s format whereby disabled applicants were asked to paste photographs showing their disability as a proof. The Court of [[Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities]] directed the UPSC to refrain from asking disabled candidates to submit photographs showing their disabilities and to consider the <U+2018>permanent disability certificate<U+2019> issued from a government hospital as a valid proof.<ref>{{cite news|title=UPSC asked to withdraw proforma which demands photographs showing disability from applicants |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/upsc-asked-to-withdraw-proforma-which-demands-photographs-showing-disability-from-applicants/506055-3.html|newspaper=IBN Live.|date=14 Oct 2014}}</ref>
