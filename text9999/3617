'''Mumbai''' ([[Marathi]]: <U+092E><U+0941><U+0902><U+092C><U+0908> ''Mumba<U+012B>'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{audio|Mumbai_pronunciation.ogg|/'mumb<U+0259>i/}}), fomerly known as '''Bombay''', is the capital of the [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]], the most populous [[List of cities in India|city]] of [[India]], and by some measures the [[List of cities by population|most populous city in the world]] with an estimated population of about 13 [[million]] (as of 2006).<ref>[http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-104&srt=npan&col=aohdq&pt=c&va=&geo=392281282 World Gazetteer]</ref> Mumbai is located on  [[Salsette Island]], off the [[Konkan|west coast]] of Maharashtra. Along with its neighbouring suburbs, it forms the world's [[List of metropolitan areas by population|sixth most populous]] [[Mumbai metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] with a population of about 25 million. The metro population ranking is projected to rise to 4th in the world by 2015 due to an annual growth rate of 2.2%.<ref>[http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua2015.pdf Demographia

Mumbai is the commercial and entertainment capital of India, and houses important financial institutions, such as the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI), the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE), the [[National Stock Exchange of India]] (NSE) and the corporate [[List of Indian companies headquartered in Mumbai|headquarters]] of many [[List of Indian companies|Indian companies]]. Mumbai has attracted migrants from all over India because of the immense business opportunities, and the relatively high [[Standard of living in India|standard of living]], making the city a potpourri of various communities and [[culture of India|cultures]]. The city is home to India's [[Hindi]] [[Indian cinema|film and television industry]], known as [[Bollywood]]. Mumbai is also one of the rare cities to accommodate a [[national park]], the [[Borivali National Park|Sanjay Gandhi National Park]], within its city limits.

== Names ==
The name Mumbai is an [[eponym]], [[Etymology|etymologically]] derived from ''Mumba'' or ''Maha-Amba''&mdash; the name of the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Mumbadevi]], and ''Aai'' &mdash; mother in [[Marathi]].<ref>Samuel Sheppard ''Bombay Place-Names and Street-Names'' (Bombay: The Times Press) 1917 pp104-5</ref> The former name ''Bombay'' had its origins in the [[16th century]] when the Portuguese arrived in the area and called the place with various names, which would finally take on the written form ''Bombaim'', still common in current Portuguese use. After the [[British Empire|British]] gained possession in the [[17th century]], it was [[anglicise]]d to ''Bombay'', although it was known as ''Mumbai'' or ''Mambai'' to Marathi and Gujarati-speakers, and as ''Bambai'' in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian.<ref>Sujata Patel "Bombay and Mumbai: Identities, Politics and Populism" in Sujata Patel & Jim Masselos (Eds.) Bombay and Mumbai. The City in Transition (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 2003 p4</ref> The name was officially changed to ''Mumbai'' in 1995, but the former name is still widely used by the city's inhabitants and a number of its famous institutions.

A widespread explanation of the origin of the traditional English name ''Bombay'' holds that it would be derived from a Portuguese name meaning ''good bay''.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/cities/findStory.cfm?city_id=MBI&folder=Facts-History Cities Guide: Mumbai] at Economist.com.</ref> This is based on the fact that ''bom'' is Portuguese for ''good'' whereas the English word ''bay'' is similar to the Portuguese ''ba<U+00ED>a'' (''bahia'' in old spelling). However, the normal Portuguese rendering of ''good bay'' would have been ''bahia boa'' rather than the grammatically incorrect ''bom bahia''.

Other sources have a different origin for the Portuguese [[toponym]] ''Bombaim''. Jos<U+00E9> Pedro Machado's ''Dicion<U+00E1>rio Onom<U+00E1>stico Etimol<U+00F3>gico da L<U+00ED>ngua Portuguesa'' ("Portuguese Dictionary of Onomastics and Etymology") mentions what is probably the first Portuguese reference to the place, dated from [[1516]], as ''Benamajambu'' or ''Tena-Maiambu'',<ref>Barbosa, Duarte, "Livro em que d<U+00E1> rela<U+00E7><U+00E3>o do que viu e ouviu no Oriente", 1516, ''apud'' Machado, J.P., "Dicion<U+00E1>rio Onom<U+00E1>stico Etimol<U+00F3>gico da L<U+00ED>ngua Portuguesa".</ref> pointing out that "maiambu"' seems to refer to Mumba-Devi, the Hindu goddess after which the place is named in Marathi (Mumbai). In that same century the spelling seems to have evolved to ''Mombayn'' (1525)<ref>Documents from the "Tombo do Estado da <U+00CD>ndia" (currently the Historical Archives of Goa or Goa Purabhilekha).</ref> and then ''Mombaim'' (1563).<ref>Orta, Garcia da, "Col<U+00F3>quios dos Simples e Drogas da <U+00CD>ndia", original edition 1565, referenced edition 1891-1895, [[apud]] Machado, J.P., "Dicion<U+00E1>rio Onom<U+00E1>stico Etimol<U+00F3>gico da L<U+00ED>ngua Portuguesa".</ref> The final form ''Bombaim'' appears later in the 16th century, as recorded by Gaspar Correia in his ''Lendas da <U+00CD>ndia'' ("Legends of India").<ref>Correia, Gaspar, "Lendas da <U+00CD>ndia", originally from the 16th century, the text was published only in 1858 and 1866.</ref> J.P. Machado seems to reject the "Bom Bahia" hypothesis, asserting that Portuguese records mentioning the presence of a bay at the place led the English to assume that the noun (''bahia'', "bay") was an integral part of the Portuguese toponym, hence the English version Bombay, adapted from Portuguese.<ref>Machado, Jos<U+00E9> Pedro, "Dicion<U+00E1>rio Onom<U+00E1>stico Etimol<U+00F3>gico da L<U+00ED>ngua Portuguesa", entry "Bombaim", volume I, pp. 265/266.</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Mumbai}}
[[image:BombayKalbadevieRoad1890.jpg|thumb|Kalbadevi Road in the 1890s, an important road in the city.]]

Present Mumbai was originally an [[archipelago]] of [[seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]].
Artefacts<!-- ARTEFACT SPELLING IS CORRECT: BRITISH ENGLISH --> found near [[Kandivali]], in northern Mumbai indicate that these islands had been inhabited since the [[Stone Age]].<ref>[http://www.touroperatorsinindia.com/Bombay/Bombay.htm Tour operators]</ref> Documented evidence of human habitation dates back to 250 BCE, when it was known as ''Heptanesia'' ([[Ptolemy]]) ([[Ancient Greek]]: ''A Cluster of Seven Islands''). In the 3rd century BCE, the islands formed part of the [[Maurya]] Empire, ruled by the [[Buddhist]] emperor, [[Ashoka|A<U+015F>oka]]. The Hindu rulers of the [[Silhara dynasty|Silhara Dynasty]] later governed the islands until 1343, when the kingdom of [[Gujarat]] annexed them. Some of the oldest edifices of the archipelago &ndash; the [[Elephanta Island|Elephanta Caves]] and the [[Banganga Tank|Walkeshwar temple complex]] date from this era.

In 1534, the Portuguese appropriated the islands from [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]]. They were ceded to [[Charles II of England]] in 1661, as [[dowry]] for [[Catherine de Braganza]]. These islands, were in turn leased to the [[British East India Company]] in 1668 for a sum of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]10 [[per annum]]. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent. The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675; In 1687, the British East India Company transferred its headquarters from [[Surat]] to Bombay. The city eventually became the headquarters of the [[Bombay Presidency]]. 

From 1817 onwards, the city was reshaped with large [[civil engineering]] projects aimed at merging all the islands in the archipelago into a single amalgamated mass. This project, known as the [[Hornby Vellard]], was completed by 1845, and resulted in the total area swelling to 438 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]. In 1853, India's first passenger [[railway]] line was established, connecting Bombay to the town of [[Thane]]. During the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865), the city became the world's chief [[cotton]] trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy and subsequently enhancing the city's stature. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 transformed Bombay into one of the largest seaports on the [[Arabian Sea]].<ref> See Mariam Dossal ''Imperial Designs and Indian Realities. The Planning of Bombay City 1845-1875'' (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1991</ref> 
[[Image:193261136_28074afd36.jpg|thumb|Samyukta Maharashtra Memorial]]
Over the next thirty years, the city grew into a major urban centre, spurred by an improvement in infrastructure and the construction of many of the city's institutions. The population of the city swelled to one million by 1906, making it the second largest in India after [[Calcutta]]. As capital of the [[Bombay Presidency]], it was a major base for the [[Indian independence movement]], with the [[Quit India Movement]] called by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1942 being its most rubric event. After India's independence in 1947, it became the capital of [[Bombay State]]. In the 1950 the city expanded to its present limits by incorporating parts of Salsette island which lay to the north. 

After 1955, when the [[State of Bombay]] was being reorganised along linguistic lines into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, there was a demand that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. However, the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra movement]] opposed this, and insisted that Bombay/Mumbai be declared the capital of Maharashtra. Following a successful protests in which 105 people were killed by police firing, Maharashtra state was formed with Bombay as its capital on [[May 1]], [[1960]].

The late 1970s witnessed a construction boom and a significant influx of migrants, which saw Bombay overtake [[Kolkata]] as India's most populous city. This led to the creation of the [[Shiv Sena]], a political outfit safeguarding the rights of 'sons of soil' in 1966. The city's secular fabric was torn apart in 1992, after large scale sectarian violence caused extensive loss of life and property. A few months later, on [[March 12]], [[1993 Bombay bombings|simultaneous bombings]] at several city landmarks by the [[Mumbai underworld]] killed around three hundred people. In 1995, the city was renamed ''Mumbai'' by the Shiv Sena party government of Maharashtra, in keeping with their policy of renaming colonial institutions after historic local appellations. There have also been bomb explosions on Public Transport Buses in the past couple of years. In [[2006]], Mumbai was also the site of a [[11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings|major terrorist incident]] in which over two hundred people were killed when several [[bomb]]s exploded almost simultaneously on the [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/07/16/mumbai.blasts.ap/index.html |title=India: Zero tolerance to terrorism |date=2006-07-16 |publisher=Associated Press via CNN |accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Mumbai}}
[[image:Bombaycitydistricts.png|thumb|The metropolis comprises the city and suburbs.]]

Mumbai is located on [[Salsette Island]], which lies at the mouth of [[Ulhas River]] off the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the [[Konkan]]. Much of Mumbai is at [[sea level]], and the average elevation ranges from 10 to 15 [[metre]]s. The northern part of Mumbai is hilly, and the highest point of the city is at 450 metres (1,450 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]).<ref>''[http://www.bhramanti.com/kanheri.html Kanheri, Lungs of Mumbai]'', Krishnadas Warrior, [http://www.bhramanti.com Bhramanti]</ref> Mumbai spans a total area of 468&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (169&nbsp;[[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]).

There are five lakes supplying water to Mumbai. They are Vihar, Vaitarna, Powai, Tulsi and Tansa lakes. Three lakes are located within the metropolitan limits &mdash; the [[Tulsi Lake]], [[Vihar Lake]] and [[Powai Lake]]. The first two are located within the [[Borivali National Park]], and supply part of the city's drinking water. Mumbai also has three small rivers within the city limits originating in the National Park. The coastline of the city is indented with numerous [[creek (tidal)|creeks]] and [[bay]]s. The eastern seaboard of Salsette Island is covered with large [[mangrove]] [[swamp]]s, rich in [[biodiversity]]. On the western seaboard, there are two beaches, named Juhu beach and Chowpatty beach.

Soil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black [[Deccan]] basalt flows, and their acid and [[basic (chemistry)|basic]] variants dating back to the late [[Cretaceous]] and early [[Eocene]] [[geologic timeline|eras]]. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone<ref>[http://theory.tifr.res.in/bombay/physical/fault.html The Seismic Environment of Mumbai], [http://theory.tifr.res.in TIFR - Theoretical Physics]</ref> owing to the presence of three fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the [[Richter]]-scale may be expected.

Mumbai is classified as a metropolis of India, under the jurisdiction of the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai|BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation]]. It consists of two distinct regions &mdash; the city and the suburbs, which also form two separate districts of Maharashtra. The city region is also commonly referred to as the '''Island City'''.<ref>[http://www.mmrdamumbai.org/projects_muip.htm MMRDA Projects], [http://www.mmrdamumbai.org Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA)]</ref>

==Climate==
{{main|Weather of Mumbai}}
[[image:heavenlybombay.png|thumb|right|Satellite image of Mumbai with [[Salsette Island]] clearly visible.]]
The climate of the city, being in the [[tropical|tropical zone]], and near the [[Arabian Sea]], may be broadly classified into two main seasons &mdash; the [[humidity|humid]] season, and the dry season. The humid season, between March and October, is characterised by high humidity and temperatures of over 30&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (86&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]). The [[monsoon]] rains lash the city between June to September, and supply most of the city's annual [[rainfall]] of 2,200&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (85&nbsp;[[inch]]es). The maximum annual rainfall ever recorded was 3,452&nbsp;mm (135.89 inches) in 1954.<ref>[http://mdmu.maharashtra.gov.in/pages/Mumbai/mumbaiplanShow.php Mumbai Plan], [http://mdmu.maharashtra.gov.in Department of Relief and Rehabilitation (Maharashtra)]</ref> The [[2005 Mumbai floods|highest rainfall]] recorded in a single day was 944&nbsp;mm (37.16&nbsp;inches) on [[2005-07-26]].<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1039257 DNA]</ref>

The dry season, between November and February, is characterised by moderate levels of humidity and warm to cool weather. Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill during January and February. Annual temperatures range from a high of 38&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (100&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) to a low of 11&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (52&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). The record high is 43.3&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (110&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and record low is 7.4&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (45&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) on [[1962-01-22]].<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/ma/maxcrc/temp.html Extreme temperatures </ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Mumbai}}
[[image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange-2.jpg|thumb|The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] index reflects investor confidence in the [[economy of India]].]]

Mumbai contributes 10% of all factory employment, 40% of all [[income tax]] collections, 60% of all [[Customs (tax)|customs duty]] collections, 20% of all central [[excise tax]] collections, 40% of India's [[foreign trade]] and [[Indian rupee|Rupees]] 40 [[1 E9|billion]] ([[US dollar|US$]] 9 billion) in [[corporate tax]]es.<ref>''Manorama Yearbook 2003'', pg 678, ISBN 81-900461-8-7</ref> A number of Indian financial institutions have headquarters in [[South Mumbai|downtown Mumbai]], including the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]], the [[Reserve Bank of India]], the [[National Stock Exchange of India]], the [[India Government Mint, Mumbai|Mint]], and numerous conglomerates (including [[Tata Group]], [[Godrej]] and [[Reliance]]). Many foreign banks and financial institutions also have branches in this area.

Up until the 1980s, Mumbai owed its prosperity largely to textile mills and the seaport, but the local economy has since been diversified to include engineering, diamond-polishing, [[healthcare]] and [[information technology]]. Mumbai<U+2019>s status as the state capital means that state and federal government employees make up a large percentage of the city's workforce. Mumbai also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled labour population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics and other such [[blue collar]] professions. The port and shipping industry too employs many residents, directly or indirectly. 

The entertainment industry is the other major employer in Mumbai. Most of India's major television and satellite networks are headquartered in Mumbai, as well as its major [[publishing]] houses. The centre of the Hindi movie industry, [[Bollywood]], is also located in Mumbai, along with its largest [[studio]]s and movie production houses. [[Marathi]] television and film industries are also based in Mumbai.

Along with the rest of India, Mumbai, its commercial capital, has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid nineties and the IT, export, services and BPO boom in this decade. The middle class in Mumbai is the segment most impacted by this boom and is the driver behind the consequent consumer boom. Upward mobility among Mumbaikars has led to a direct increase in consumer spending.

The city is administered by the [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]] (BMC) (formerly the Bombay Municipal Corporation), with executive power vested in the [[Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai|Municipal Commissioner]], who is an [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS officer]] appointed by the [[Maharashtra#Government|state government]]. The Corporation comprises 227 directly elected Councillors representing the twenty four [[Administrative divisions of Mumbai|municipal wards]],<ref>[http://www.mcgm.gov.in/forms/Wards.aspx?slmno=MTE%3d-7nR%2f8MPTOxg%3d Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai]</ref> five nominated Councillors, and a titular [[Mayor of Mumbai|Mayor]]. The BMC is in charge of the civic and infrastructure needs of the metropolis. An Assistant Municipal Commissioner oversees each ward for administrative purposes. Almost all the [[:category:Indian political parties-Maharashtra|state political parties]] field candidates in the elections for Councillors. 

The metropolitan area forms two [[List of Indian districts|districts]] of Maharashtra, with each district under the jurisdiction of a [[District Collector]]. The Collectors are in charge of property records and revenue collection for the [[Government of India|Federal Government]], and oversee the [[Elections in India|national elections]] held in the city. 

The [[Mumbai Police]] is headed by a [[Police Commissioner of Mumbai|Police Commissioner]], who is an [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officer. The Mumbai Police comes under the state Home Ministry. The city is divided into seven police zones and seventeen traffic police zones, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police. The Traffic Police is a semi-autonomous body under the Mumbai Police. 

Mumbai is the seat of the [[Bombay High Court]], which exercises jurisdiction over the states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]], and the [[Union Territory|Union Territories]] of [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. Mumbai also has two lower courts, the [[Small Causes Court]] for civil matters, and the [[Sessions Court]] for criminal cases.

The city elects six members to the [[Indian Parliament|Lok Sabha]] and thirty-four members to the Maharashtra [[Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha|State Assembly]].

==Transport==
{{main|Public transport in Mumbai}}
[[Image:Best cbd wad.jpg|thumb|[[Bombay Electricity Supply Transport|BEST]] buses form an integral part of the city's transport system.]]
Most of Mumbai's inhabitants rely on [[public transport]] to travel to and from their workplace due to the lack of car parking spaces, traffic bottlenecks, and generally poor road conditions especially in the monsoon. The city is the headquarters of two [[Indian railways|rail divisions]] &ndash; the Central Railway (CR) headquartered at [[Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] (formerly known as Victoria Terminus), and the Western Railway (WR) headquartered near [[Churchgate]]. The backbone of the city's transport, the [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]], is composed of three separate networks running the length of the city, in a north-south direction. The [[Western Railway]] runs along the western region of the city, while the [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]] covers most of the central and northeast parts of the metropolis. Both lines extend into the exurbs, each covering a total one-way length of around 125&nbsp;km. The [[Harbour Line]] is a sub-division of the [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]], covering a distance of 54&nbsp;km along the south-eastern section of the city, near the docks, and extending into [[Navi Mumbai]] (New Bombay). Mumbai is well connected by the [[Indian Railways]] to most parts of [[India]]. 

Public buses run by the [[Bombay Electricity Supply Transport|BEST]] (an autonomous body under the BMC) cover almost all parts of the metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai and [[Thane]]. Buses are used for commuting short to medium distances, while train fares are more economical for long distance commutes. The BEST fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker and air-conditioned buses.
[[Image:Mumbai terminal 1b.jpg|thumb|[[Mumbai Airport]]]] 
Black and yellow-metered taxis, accommodating up to four passengers with luggage, cover most of the metropolis. [[Auto rickshaw]]s, allowed to operate only in the suburban areas, are the main form of hired transport here. These three-wheeled vehicles can accommodate up to three passengers. 

Mumbai's [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] (formerly, Sahar International Airport) is the busiest airport in India, and caters to cargo and international flights while [[Santacruz Airport]] caters to domestic flights. The nearby [[Juhu aerodrome]] was India's first airport, and now hosts a [[flying club]] and a [[heliport]]. 

With its unique topography, Mumbai has one of the best natural harbours in the world, handling 50% of the country's passenger traffic, and much of India's cargo. It is also an important base for the [[Indian Navy]].<ref> Matthew, K.M. (2006). Manorama Yearbook 2003, pg 524, Malaya Manorama. ISBN 81-89004-07-7</ref>  Ferries from [[Ferry wharf|Ferry Wharf]] allow cheap access to islands and beaches in the area.

==Utility services==

The BMC supplies [[potable water]] to the city, most of which come from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes, as well as a few lakes further north. The water is filtered at [[Bhandup]], which is also Asia's largest water filtration plant. The BMC is also responsible for the road maintenance and garbage collection in the city. Almost all of Mumbai's daily refuse of 7,800&nbsp;[[metric tonne]]s<ref>''The Times of India'', Mumbai edition (print), [[2005-04-19]], pg 2</ref> is transported to dumping grounds in [[Gorai]] in the northwest, [[Mulund]] in the northeast, and [[Deonar]] in the east. [[Sewage]] treatment is carried out in [[Worli]] and [[Bandra]]. 

[[Electricity]] is provided by the BEST in the city, and by [[Reliance Energy]], [[Tata]], and [[Mahavitaran]] (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd) in the suburbs. Most of the city's electricity is [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] and [[nuclear energy|nuclear]] based. The largest [[telephone]] service provider is the state-owned [[MTNL]], which held a [[monopoly]] over fixed line and cellular services up until 2000, and provides fixed line as well as mobile [[Wireless local loop|WLL]] services. [[Cell phone]] coverage is extensive, and the main service providers are [[Orange (company)|Hutch]], [[Airtel]], [[BPL group]], [[Reliance Infocomm]] and [[Tata Indicom]]. Both [[GSM]] and [[CDMA]] services are available in the city. [[Broadband internet]] penetration is increasing in the city, with MTNL and [[Tata group|Tata]] being the leading service providers.

The population of Mumbai is about 18 million, with a density of about 29,000 persons per square kilometre. There are 811 females to every 1,000 males &ndash; which is lower than the national average, because many working males come from rural areas, where they leave behind their families. The overall literacy rate of the city is above 86%, which is higher than the national average.<ref name=GISData>[http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm "Census GIS Household"]. <u>censusindiamaps.net</u>. 2006.</ref> The religions represented in Mumbai include [[Hindu]]s (68% of the population), [[Muslim]]s (17% of the population), and [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Jains]] (4% each).

According to the 1991 census, the ethnic groups demographics are - [[Marathi people]] (42%), [[Gujarati people]] (18%), ''[[North Indian]]'' (21%), [[Kannadigas]] (5%), [[Tamil people]] (3%), [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] (3%) and others.

For a city of its size, Mumbai has a moderate crime rate. Mumbai recorded 27,577 incidents of crime in 2004, which is down 11% from 30,991 in 2001. The city's main jail is the [[Arthur Road Jail]].<ref>''The Times of India'', Mumbai edition (print), [[2005-03-14]], pg 5</ref>

Mumbai has a large [[polyglot]] population like any other metropolitan city of India. Marathi, the official language of Maharashtra is widely spoken. Other languages spoken are Hindi and English. A colloquial form of Hindi, known as ''[[Bambaiya]]'' &ndash; a blend of Marathi, Hindi, [[Indian English]] and some invented colloquial words is spoken on streets. English is extensively spoken, and is the principal language of the city's [[white collar]] workforce.

Like other large cities in the developing world, Mumbai suffers from the same major urbanisation problems seen in many fast growing cities in [[developing countries]] &mdash; widespread poverty and poor public [[health]], [[employment]], civic and educational standards for a large section of the population. With available space at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways. According to the ''Business Week'', around 43% of the population lives in shantytowns and slums. Even though [[Prostitution in India|prostitution is illegal in India]], Mumbai has a large population of [[sex workers]], estimated to number more than 100,000.<ref name = USstate>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8230.htm "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: India"], [[US State Department]], 2001.</ref> High [[HIV]] prevalence among the female sex-workers (consistently above 50% since 1993<ref name = WHO> [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/wpro/2001/9290611588.pdf "HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific Region 2001"], [[World Health Organization]], 2001.</ref><ref name = MAPN> [http://www.mapnetwork.org/docs/MAP_AIDSinAsia2004.pdf  "AIDS in Asia, Face the Facts"], Monitoring the AIDS Pandemic (MAP) Network report, 2004.</ref>), contributes to the spread of AIDS in the region and the country.<ref name = MAPN/>

A resident of Mumbai is called a ''[[Mumbaikar]]'', or ''Bombayite''. Many residents prefer to stay close to major railway stations for easy access to their workplaces, as a significant amount of time is spent on daily commuting. Thus, many live a fast-paced life, with very little time for social activities. Bombay residents celebrate [[Indian festivals|Indian]] and Western festivals with great fanfare.

The metropolis has its own local roadside [[fast food]] flavour, comprising [[vada pav]] (leavened wheat bread split in half, with fried dumplings as filling), [[panipuri]] (deep fried cr<U+00EA>pe with tamarind and lentil sauce), pav bhaji (leavened wheat bread accompanied with fried vegetables) and [[bhelpuri]] (puffed rice mixture), while [[South India]]n and [[Chinese food]] are also very popular. The cosmopolitan residents have unique tastes in cuisine, [[Music of India|music]], film and literature, both Indian and international. In 2004, Mumbai received three [[World Heritage Sites|heritage conservation awards]] from the [[UNESCO]].

Mumbai is the birthplace of [[Indian cinema]] ([[Dadasaheb Phalke]] laid the foundations by his silent movies followed by his [[Marathi]] talkies), with the oldest film broadcast here in the early 20th century. Mumbai also boasts of large number of cinemas, including [[Asia]]'s largest [[IMAX]] dome theatre, which feature mainstream [[Bollywood]], [[Marathi]] and [[Hollywood]] movies. Many film festivals are avidly attended throughout the year. Besides catering to cinephiles, the city has a thriving theatrical tradition both in the regional languages and in English. Contemporary art is well represented in both government funded art spaces and private commercial galleries.  The government funded [[art gallery|art galleries]] include  The [[Jehangir Art Gallery]] and The [[National Gallery of Modern Art]].  Built in 1833, the [[Asiatic Society of Bombay]] is the oldest [[public library]] in the city. The city also contains most of India's [[Tallest buildings in India|tallest buildings]]. 

<!-- Mumbai also has one of the largest populations of [[sex workers]] in India. Although [[Prostitution in India|prostitution]] in Mumbai is illegal, it nevertheless hosts one of the largest and densest [[red-light districts]] in the world, [[Kamathipura]].-->

Mumbai has six [[sister city|sister cities]] (the maximum permitted by the Indian government). They are: [[Berlin]], [[London]],  [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Yokohama]].<ref>[http://web.mid-day.com/1news/city/2000/november/4560.htm BMC to woo sister cities]</ref>

==Media==

Mumbai has numerous [[newspaper]] publications and television and radio stations &ndash; Popular [[English language|English]] newspapers published and sold in Mumbai include the ''[[Times of India]]'', ''[[Mid-day]]'' and ''[[Indian Express]]''. [[Marathi language|Marathi]] newspapers include ''[[Loksatta]]'', ''[[Sakaal]]'' and ''[[Maharashtra Times]]''. In addition to these papers, newspapers are also printed in other Indian languages. Mumbai is also home to India's oldest newspaper, ''[[Bombay Samachar]]'', which has been published in Gujarati and English since 1822. ''Bombay Durpan''-the first Marathi newspaper was started by Jambhekar in Mumbai on 1832.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/br/2002/02/05/stories/2002020500040500.htm   Privatising emancipation] </ref>

The national television broadcaster [[Doordarshan]] provides two free terrestrial channels, while three main cable networks serve most households. [[Zee Marathi]], DD Sahyadri, Zee TV, Star plus and news channels are popular. [[DTH|Satellite television (DTH)]] has yet to gain mass acceptance, due to high installation costs. Mumbai households receive over a hundred television channels via cable, and a majority of them are produced to cater to the city's [[polyglot]] populace. The metropolis is also the hub of many international media corporations, with many news channels and print publications having a major presence.

There are nine radio stations in Mumbai, with six broadcasting on the [[Frequency modulation|FM]] band, and three [[All India Radio]] stations broadcasting on the [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] band.

==Education==
[[Image:Nehru c.jpg|thumb|Nehru Science Center and Planetarium]]

Schools in Mumbai are either "municipal schools" (run by the BMC) or private schools (run by trusts and individuals) which are usually aided by the government. A majority of residents prefer private schools because of better infrastructure and the use of English as a medium of instruction. All private schools are affiliated either to the Maharashtra State [[Secondary School Certificate|SSC]] board, or the all-India [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education|Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE)]] and [[CBSE|Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE)]] boards. Demand is especially high for ICSE and CBSE affiliated schools, and those run by [[convent]]s or the [[Jesuits]]. The government run public schools lack many facilities, but are the only option for poorer residents who cannot afford the more expensive private schools.

Under the [[10+2+3 plan]], students complete ten years of schooling, and then enroll for two years in [[Junior College]], where they choose from one of three streams: [[liberal arts|Arts]], [[Commerce]] or [[Science]]. This is followed by either a general degree course in a chosen field of study, or a professional degree course, such as [[law]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]] etc. Most colleges in the city are affiliated to the [[University of Mumbai]], one of the largest [[university|universities]] in the world in terms of graduation rate. The [[IIT Bombay|Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay]], one of India's premier [[engineering]] schools, and the [[SNDT Women's University]] are the other universities in Mumbai.

Mumbai is home to two of [[India]]'s important research institutions &ndash; The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research ([[TIFR]]), and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ([[BARC]]).

==Sports==
[[Image:Wankhede-1.JPG|thumb|[[Wankhede Stadium]] hosts [[cricket]], Mumbai's most popular sport]]
[[Cricket]] is the most popular sport in the city, and is usually played in the [[maidan]]s (grounds) around the city. [[Backyard cricket|Gully cricket]], a modified form of cricket, is played in the narrow by-lanes of the city, especially on Sundays. Mumbai has produced several [[famous cricketers from Mumbai|famous international cricketers]], and is home to the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI). International cricket is widely watched, and the city almost comes to a virtual standstill on days when the [[Indian cricket team]] plays important matches. The city has two international cricket stadiums, the [[Wankhede Stadium]] and the [[Brabourne Stadium]]. The local [[Mumbai cricket team]] is among the strongest competitors in the [[Ranji Trophy]], the nation's top domestic cricketing circuit.

[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the second most popular sport with the city clubs playing during the [[monsoon]]s, when other outdoor sports cannot be played. The [[Football World Cup]] is one of the most widely watched television events in Mumbai. India's national sport, [[field hockey]], has gone into a sharp decline in the recent years, losing out in terms of popularity to cricket, though many Mumbai players play in the national team.

Other sports are mostly played in the numerous clubs and [[gymkhana]]s, and include [[lawn tennis|tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[billiards]], [[badminton]], [[table tennis]] and [[golf]]. Mumbai also plays Rugby, one of the few cities to do so in the country. Every February, Mumbai holds the [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]] races in the [[Mahalaxmi Racecourse]]. The event sees many of the city's glitterati attending, arrayed in the latest fashions. In recent times [[Formula 1]] racing has also caught the public's attention. Other sports such as [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]] are mostly popular in schools and colleges.

In 2004, the [[Mumbai Marathon]], an annual event sponsored by [[Standard Chartered Bank]], was established in a bid to bring the sport to the Indian public.
