Livingston Avenue, which was designated Route 26, continues under the designation [[County Route 691 (Middlesex County, New Jersey)|Middlesex County Route 691]].<ref name="sld"/>

==History==
The road from New Brunswick to Trenton was built in the 19th century as the [[Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike]], commonly called the Straight Turnpike due to its complete lack of curves. The road eventually fell into disrepair in favor of the older road via [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], which became part of the [[Lincoln Highway]] in 1913 and [[pre-1927 Route 13 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 13]] in 1916.<ref name="NYT">Road Conditions Reported Usual, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[May 12]], [[1929]]]</ref>

In 1926, the turnpike was legislated into the state highway system as an unnumbered route. It received its number, Route 26, in the [[1927 renumbering]], and was reconstructed by the state. Except for the bridge over the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (now [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]]) in North Brunswick, the road was completed by early 1929.<!--was US 1 rerouted then or only when 25 was finished?-->

The road was taken over by the state from the New Brunswick city line at Nassau Street to [[Brunswick Circle]] near Trenton. A short piece of the turnpike southwest of Brunswick Circle to the Trenton city line at Spruce Street had been taken over ca. 1920 as part of [[pre-1927 Route 13 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 13]]. Inside New Brunswick, the old turnpike (Livingston Avenue) was '''County Route 3R16''', but was signed as part of Route 26 to its end at [[Route S28 (New Jersey)|Route S28]] ([[George Street (New Brunswick)|George Street]]). A spur along Jersey Avenue, which was taken over as [[Route 26A (New Jersey)|Route 26A]], provided direct access to [[New Jersey Route 27|Route 27]] in New Brunswick.

Most of the [[Calhoun Street Extension]] from Brunswick Circle to the [[Calhoun Street Bridge]] in Trenton was taken over ca. 1932, but nothing indicates it was part of Route 26. It provided an alternate route into Pennsylvania, bypassing downtown Trenton. The [[Trenton Freeway]], opened ca. 1953, was built as an extension of Route 26, running from Brunswick Circle through downtown into Pennsylvania.

In the [[1953 renumbering]], Route 26 was truncated to run only in the New Brunswick area, as the rest was part of [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 1]].

==Related routes==
There were two routes related to Route 26. The first was '''[[Route 26A (New Jersey)|Route 26A]]''', a spur into [[New Brunswick (NJ)|New Brunswick]] on the west side of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Route 26A is now numbered as [[Route 91 (New Jersey)|Route 91]]. The second route, '''Route S26''', was also defined in the [[1927 renumbering]] as a short spur of Route 26, running from just north of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] overpass in North Brunswick east to the junction of [[Route 25 (New Jersey)|Route 25]] and [[Route 25M (New Jersey)|Route 25M]], now the junction of [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 1]], [[U.S. Route 130]] and [[Route 171 (New Jersey)|Route 171]]. It opened ca. 1929, and became part of U.S. Route 1 in the [[1953 renumbering]].
