[[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team tour of England in 1948]]. Bradman's men were undefeated in their 34 matches and this unprecedented feat by a touring side earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''. 

An experienced right-handed [[batting order (cricket)|opening]] batsman, Brown was on his third visit to England, having first toured in 1934 before the [[Second World War]]. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948, [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] had risen above him in the pecking order to become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown was selected as a reserve opener, a decision that was controversial among critics who believed that he was past his best.

Bradman rotated his three openers in the tour matches, but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the [[batting order (cricket)|middle order]]. However, Brown had appeared to be uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.

Nevertheless, Brown had success in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He scored 1448 runs at 57.92 in all [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], ranking fourth in both the aggregates and [[batting average]]s. He scored eight [[century (cricket)|centuries]], second only to Bradman, including 200 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a very circumspect manner in order to increase the reliability of his batting and volume of his scoring. A very occasional [[off spin]] bowler, Brown took his first-class best of 4/16 from 25 balls in his only stint with the ball, against the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]].

== Early tour ==
Brown had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and immediately after the [[Second World War]], he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].<Ref name=az/> However, in 1946&ndash;47 he was sidelined with injury and [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html|title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> Brown resumed his Test career the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after two Tests.

England batted first and made 165, with Brown prominent in the field.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI.

Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,<ref>Perry (2005), pp. 253&ndash;254.</ref> with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for [[Doug Ring]], while Brown missed out.
