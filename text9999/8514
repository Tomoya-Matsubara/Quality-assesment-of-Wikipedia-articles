'''Michael Joseph Jackson''' (born August 29, 1958) is a [[United States|US]] [[musician]] and [[entertainment|entertainer]]. The seventh child of the [[Jackson family]], he debuted on the professional music scene at the age of 11 as a member of [[The Jackson 5]] and began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group. In the early 1980s, he became a dominant figure in [[popular music]] as the first [[African-American]] entertainer to amass a strong [[crossover (music)|crossover]] following on [[MTV]]. Referred to as the "King of Pop" in subsequent years, five of his solo [[studio album]]s have become some of the world's best-selling records: ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' (1979), ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' (1982), ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987), ''[[Dangerous (album)|Dangerous]]'' (1991) and ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]'' (1995).

The popularity of his [[music videos]] airing on MTV, such as "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]" and ''[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]''<U+2014>credited for transforming the music video into an art form and a promotional tool<U+2014>helped bring the relatively new channel to fame. Videos such as "[[Black or White]]" and "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]" kept Jackson as a staple on MTV into the 1990s. With stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of physically complicated dance techniques, such as the [[robot (dance)|robot]] and the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style influenced numerous [[hip hop]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B]] artists.

Jackson has donated and raised millions of dollars for beneficial causes through his [[Dangerous World Tour]], charity [[singles (music)|singles]] and support of 39 charities.<ref name = "tara 452<U+2013>454">Taraborrelli, p. 452<U+2013>454</ref> However, other aspects of his personal life<U+2014>including his [[plastic surgery]], his lightening skin, and his eccentric behavior<U+2014>have generated significant controversy and have damaged his public image. He was accused of [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse in 1993]], although the matter was settled out of court. Jackson then married twice and fathered three children, all of which caused further controversy. In 2005, Jackson was [[People v. Jackson|tried and later acquitted]] of further sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. He has experienced [[Michael Jackson's health and appearance|health concerns]] since the early 1990s and reported financial difficulties since the late 1990s.

One of the few artists to have been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice, his other achievements include multiple ''[[Guinness World Records]]''<U+2014>including one for ''Thriller'' as the [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|world's best-selling album]]<U+2014>13 [[Grammy Award]]s, 13 [[List of artists who reached number one on the Hot 100 (U.S.)#J|number one singles]] in his solo career<U+2014>more than any other male artist after the creation of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard''&nbsp;Hot&nbsp;100]]<U+2014>and the sale of over 750&nbsp;million units worldwide. Jackson's highly publicized personal life, coupled with his [[Records and achievements by Michael Jackson|successful career]], has made him a part of [[popular culture]] for almost four decades.

From a young age Jackson was physically and mentally abused by his father, enduring incessant rehearsals, whippings and name-calling. Jackson's abuse as a child affected him throughout his grown life.<ref name="MJ's secret childhood">{{cite web  |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson's Secret Childhood |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref> In one altercation<U+2014>later recalled by Marlon Jackson<U+2014>Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and "pummelled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks".<ref name = "tara 20-22">Taraborrelli, p. 20<U+2013>22</ref> Joseph would often trip up, or push the male children into walls.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/> One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/>

Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]]. He said that during his childhood he often cried from loneliness and would sometimes get sick or start to [[regurgitate]] upon seeing his father.<ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16">Campbell (1995), p. 14<U+2013>16</ref><ref name = "lewis 165-168">Lewis p. 165<U+2013>168</ref><ref>George, p. 45<U+2013>46</ref><ref>Taraborrelli, p. 620</ref> In Jackson's other high profile interview, ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'' (2003), the singer covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/> Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed and that "[i]f you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you."<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 602</ref>

Jackson showed musical talent early in his life, performing in front of classmates and others during a [[Christmas]] recital at the age of five.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> In 1964, Jackson and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers<U+2014>a band formed by brothers Jackie, Tito and Jermaine<U+2014>as backup musicians playing [[congas]] and [[tambourine]], respectively. Jackson later began performing backup vocals and dancing; at the age of eight, he and Jermaine assumed lead vocals, and the group's name was changed to [[The Jackson 5]].<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> The band toured [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]] extensively from 1965 to 1967. The band frequently performed at a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the "[[chitlin' circuit]]", where they often opened for [[striptease]]s and other adult acts. In 1966, they won a major local talent show with renditions of [[Motown sound|Motown]] hits and [[James Brown]]'s "[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]", led by Michael.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/the-jackson-five |title=The Jackson Five |accessdate=2007-05-29 |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]}}</ref>

The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for the local record label [[Steeltown Records|Steeltown]] in 1967 and signed with [[Motown Records]] in 1968.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts", noting that Michael "quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer" after he began to dance and sing with his brothers.<ref name="rollingstone"/> Though Michael sang with a "child's piping voice, he danced like a grown-up hoofer and sang with the R&B/gospel inflections of [[Sam Cooke]], [[James Brown]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]".<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/biography|title=Michael Jackson: Biography|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> The group set a record{{vague}} when its first four singles ("[[I Want You Back]]", "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]", "[[The Love You Save]]" and "[[I'll Be There]]") charted at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard''&nbsp;Hot&nbsp;100]].<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> During The Jackson&nbsp;5's early years, Motown's public relations team claimed that Jackson was nine years old<U+2014>two years younger than he actually was<U+2014>to make him appear cuter and more accessible to the mainstream audience.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 17</ref> Starting in 1972, Jackson released a total of four solo studio albums with Motown, among them ''[[Got to Be There]]'' and ''[[Ben (album)|Ben]]''. These were released as part of the Jackson&nbsp;5 franchise, and produced successful singles such as "[[Got to Be There (song)|Got to Be There]]", "[[Ben (song)|Ben]]" and a remake of [[Bobby Day]]'s "[[Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin]]". The group's sales began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22">George, p. 22</ref> Although the group scored several top&nbsp;40 hits, including the top&nbsp;5 [[disco]] single "[[Dancing Machine]]" and the top&nbsp;20 hit "[[I Am Love]]", the Jackson&nbsp;5 left Motown in 1975.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/>

===1976<U+2013>1981: Move to Epic and ''Off the Wall''===
The Jackson 5 signed a new contract with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] in June 1975, joining first the Philadelphia International Records division and then [[Epic Records]].<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/> As a result of legal proceedings, the group was renamed The Jacksons.<ref name = "tara 138<U+2013>144">Taraborrelli, p. 138<U+2013>144</ref> After the name change, the band continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984. From 1976 to 1984, Michael Jackson was the lead songwriter of the group, writing hits such as "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[This Place Hotel]]" and "[[Can You Feel It]]".<ref name="RRHF" />

In 1978, Jackson starred as [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] in the film musical ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]''.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 163<U+2013>169</ref> The musical scores were arranged by [[Quincy Jones]], who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's solo album ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]''.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 23">George, p. 23</ref> In 1979, Jackson broke his nose during a complex dance routine. His subsequent [[rhinoplasty]] surgery was not a complete success, and Jackson complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Dr. Steven Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's second rhinoplasty and other subsequent operations.<ref name = "tara 205<U+2013>210">Taraborrelli, p. 205<U+2013>210</ref>

Jones and Jackson jointly produced ''Off the Wall'', whose songwriters included Jackson, [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]'s [[Rod Temperton]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Released in 1979, ''Off the Wall'' was the first album to generate four US top&nbsp;10 hits, including the chart-topping singles "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]" and "[[Rock with You]]".<ref name = "Nelson George overview 37-38"/> ''Off the Wall'' reached number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name="Off the wall">[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time "The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"] ([http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6598014/68_off_the_wall "#68: Off the wall"]), ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ([[2003-11-18]]).</ref> and eventually sold over 15&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611">Taraborrelli, p. 610<U+2013>612</ref> In 1980, Jackson won three awards at the [[American Music Awards]] for his solo efforts: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Male Soul/R&B Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Single (for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough").<ref name = "Nelson George overview 37-38">George, p. 37<U+2013>38</ref> That year, he also won [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] for Top Black Artist and Top Black Album and a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance (for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough").<ref name = "Nelson George overview 37-38"/> Despite its commercial success, Jackson felt ''Off the Wall'' should have made a much bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 188</ref>

===1982<U+2013>1985: ''Thriller''===
In 1982, Jackson contributed the song "Someone In the Dark" to the storybook for the film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''; the record won a Grammy for Best Album for Children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Michael+Jackson&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=Grammy Award Winners|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> That year Jackson issued his second Epic album, ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''.

[[Image:Michael Jackson with the Reagans.png|thumb|right|Jackson at the White House South Portico with President [[Ronald Reagan]] at left, and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] at right, 1984]]
On March 25, 1983, Jackson performed live on the ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' television special, both with The Jackson&nbsp;5 and on his own singing "Billie Jean". Debuting his signature dance move<U+2014>the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]<U+2014>his performances during the event were seen by 47&nbsp;million viewers during its initial airing, and drew comparions to [[Elvis Presley]]'s and the [[The Beatles]]' appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 238<U+2013>241</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing".<ref name="Dancing feet of Michael Jackson">{{cite news|first=Anna |last=Kisselgoff |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE1539F935A35750C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink |title=Dancing feet of Michael Jackson |work=[[New York Times]] |date=[[1988-03-06]] |accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>

Jackson suffered a setback on January 27, 1984. While filming a [[Pepsi Cola]] commercial at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Jackson suffered second degree burns to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire. Happening in front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, the incident was the subject of heavy media scrutiny and elicited an outpouring of sympathy.<ref name = "tara 279<U+2013>287">Taraborrelli, p. 279<U+2013>287</ref> PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5&nbsp;million settlement to the "Michael Jackson Burn Center" which was a piece of new technology to help people with severe burns.<ref name = "tara 279<U+2013>287"/> Jackson had his third rhinoplasty shortly afterward and grew self conscious about his appearance.<ref name = "tara 205<U+2013>210"/>

On May 14, 1984, Jackson was invited to the [[White House]] to receive an award presented by American President [[Ronald Reagan]]. The award was given for Jackson's support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 304<U+2013>307</ref> Jackson won eight awards during the 1984 Grammys. Unlike later albums, ''Thriller'' did not have an official tour to promote it, but the 1984 [[Victory Tour]], headlined by The Jacksons, showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 315<U+2013>319</ref> He donated his five million dollar share from the Victory Tour to charity.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 320</ref> 

Jackson changed the way the industry functioned; as an artistic entity and a financial, profitable organisation. His attorney [[John Branca]] noted that Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point; approximately $2 for every album sold. He was also making record breaking profit from compact discs or the sale of ''The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller''; a documentary produced by Jackson and [[John Landis]]. Funded by MTV, the documentary sold over 350,000 copies in a few months of sale. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12.<ref name=TIME/> ''Thriller'' retains a position in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]; biographer [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]] explains, "At some point, ''Thriller'' stopped selling like a leisure item<U+2014>like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie<U+2014>and started selling like a household staple."<ref name="tara 226">Taraborrelli, p. 226</ref>

Gil Friesen, President of [[A&M Records]], said "the whole industry has a stake in this success".<ref name=TIME/> ''Thriller'' raised the importance of albums, but multiple hits also changed notions about the number of singles to release.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/jackson_michael/bio.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson |publisher=VH1 |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-22 }}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine explained that "the fallout from ''Thriller'' has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1&nbsp;billion".<ref name=TIME>{{cite news | first= Jay | last= Cocks | title= Why He's a Thriller | date= March 1984| publisher= ''Time'' | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950053-1,00.html | accessdate= 2007-03-17 }}</ref> ''Time'' summed up ''Thriller'''s impact as a "restoration of confidence" for an industry bordering on "the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as "Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too".<ref name=TIME/> According to the ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''Thriller'' paved the way for other acts such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref name=WashPost1>{{cite news | first= Richard | last= Harrington | title= Prince & Michael Jackson: Two Paths to the Top of Pop |date= 1988-10-09 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73636369.html?dids=73636369:73636369&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+9%2C+1988&author=Richard+Harrington&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=g.01&desc=Prince+%26+Michael+Jackson%3A+Two+Paths+to+the+Top+of+Pop | accessdate= 2007-05-21 }}</ref>

With help from [[Lionel Richie]], Jackson co-wrote the charity single "[[We Are the World]]", released worldwide to aid people in Africa and the US. Jackons was one of many music celebrities who performed on the record. Released in March 1985, the single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20&nbsp;million copies sold and millions of dollars raised for charity. It was the first time Jackson was seen as a humanitarian.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 340<U+2013>344</ref> The singer purchased [[Northern Songs]], a music catalog holding thousands of songs.

 |title=Bad Fortunes |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[2005-06-15]] |accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> The idea came to Jackson while working on the hit single "[[Say Say Say]]" with McCartney a few years prior. The pair became friendly, occasionally visiting one another. In one discussion, McCartney told Jackson about the millions of dollars he had made from music catalogs; he was earning approximately $40&nbsp;million a year from other peoples songs.<ref name = "tara 333-337">Taraborrelli, p. 333<U+2013>337</ref> 

Jackson began a business career buying music and shortly afterward Northern Songs was put up for sale. He was warned that he would face strong competition, excited, he skipped around the room saying, "I don't care. I want those songs. Get me those songs Branca [his attorney]". Branca then contacted the attorney of McCartney, who clarified that his client was not interested in bidding because, "It's too pricey". After Jackson had started negotiations, McCartney changed his mind and tried to persuade Yoko Ono to join him in a joint bid, she declined, so he pulled out. Jackson eventually beat off the rest of the competition in negotiations that lasted 10 months. When McCartney found out he said, "I think it's dodgy to do things like that. To be someones friend and then buy the rug they're standing on". Reacting to that statement, biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli observed that McCartney made millions of dollars from the music of other people. He had more money than Jackson at that point so could have made a substantial bid for his own music and would not have suffered financial danger from Jackson owning the catalog.<ref name = "tara 333-337"/>

In 1986, the tabloid press ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a [[hyperbaric oxygen chamber]] to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box.

One of Jackson's most acclaimed performances came during the halftime show at [[Super Bowl XXVII]]. As the performances began, Jackson was catapulted onto the stage as fireworks went off behind him.

===2000<U+2013>2002: Label dispute and ''Invincible''===
In 2000, Jackson was waiting for the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert back to him; this allowed him to promote his old material how he liked and prevented Sony from getting a cut of the profit. Jackson expected this to occur early in the new millennium, however, due to the fine print and various clauses in the contract, this revert date is still many years away. Jackson began an investigation, and it emerged that the attorney who represented the singer in the deal was also representing Sony, creating a [[conflict of interest]].<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> Jackson was also concerned about another conflict of interest. For a number of years, Sony had been pushing to buy all of the [[Northern Songs]] catalog from the singer. If Jackson's career or financial situation were to deteriorate, he would have to sell his catalog. Thus, Sony had something to gain from Jackson's career failing.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617"/> Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> Just before the release of ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'', Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment, [[Tommy Mottola]], that he was leaving Sony.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> As a result, all singles releases, video shootings and promotions concerning the ''Invincible'' album were canceled. Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that Mottola was a "devil" and a "racist" who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own personal gain.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> He charged that Mottola had called his colleague [[Irving Lorenzo|Irv Gotti]] a "fat [[nigger]]".<ref>{{cite interview |last=Jackson |first=Jermaine |subjectlink=Jermaine Jackson |interviewer=[[Connie Chung]]| title=Interview with Jermaine Jackson |date=December 31, 2002 |program=[[Connie Chung Tonight]] |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0212/31/cct.00.html |accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> Sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote ''Invincible'' with sufficient energy, maintaining that Jackson refused to tour in the US.<ref>{{cite web|author=Burkeman, Oliver|title=Jacko gets tough: but is he a race crusader or just a falling star?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jul/08/oliverburkeman|date=July 8, 2002|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>

Six years after his last studio album and after spending much of the late 1990s to early millennium out of the public eye, Jackson released ''Invincible'' in October 2001 to much anticipation. To help promote the album, a special [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|30th Anniversary celebration]] at Madison Square Garden occurred in September 2001 to mark the singer's thirtieth year as a solo artist. Jackson appeared onstage alongside his brothers for the first time since 1984.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|author=Branigan, Tania|title=Jackson spends <U+00A3>20m to be Invincible|publisher=[[The  Guardian]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/sep/08/taniabranigan|date=September 8, 2001|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> The show also featured performances by [[M<U+00FD>a]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Whitney Houston]], [['N Sync]], and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], among other artists.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 50-53"/> At around the same time, in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Jackson helped organize the [[United We Stand: What More Can I Give]] [[benefit concert]] at [[RFK Stadium]] in [[Washington D.C.]] The concert was aired on October 21, 2001, and included performances from dozens of major artists, including Jackson, who performed his song "[[What More Can I Give]]" as the finale.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617"/> ''Invincible'' was a commercial success, debuting atop the charts in 13 countries and going on to sell approximately 10&nbsp;million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the US.<ref name="RIAA certifications"/><ref name="KOP achievements"/><ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617">Taraborrelli, p. 614<U+2013>617</ref> However, the sales for ''Invincible'' were notably low compared to his previous releases, due in part to a diminishing pop music industry, the lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and the label dispute.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617"/> The album spawned three singles, "[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]" and "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]", the latter did not have a music video.

Reviews of ''Invincible'' were generally favorable, but there was a consensus that it was one of Jackson's least impressive records, mostly because it was too long. Allmusic gave the record three out of five stars saying, "Ultimately, the record runs too long, losing steam halfway through...[It's] not enough to make ''Invincible'' the comeback Jackson needed...but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop".<ref name="ALG Invincible">{{cite web|url=http://wc03.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A0dq5g4hptv8z |title=Michael Jackson :Invincible |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}</ref> ''[[NME]]'' gave the record six out of ten, stating, ''Invincible'' is a relevant and rejuvenated comeback album made overlong".<ref name="NME Invincible">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/michael-jackson/5780|title=Michael Jackson :Invincible |work=[[NME]] |date=[[2001-11-30]] |accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''Invincible'' three out of five stars, believing that the early R&B tracks were good, but the later ballads made the record too long.<ref name="RS Invincible"/> Reviewer [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A-, saying, "His skills seem undiminished...his funk is steelier and his ballads are airier, both to disquieting effect.

[[Image:Michael Jackson fans waving posters in support of MJ.jpg|thumb|Fans show their support for Jackson after the entertainer is accused of child molestation in 2003.]]
In 2003, Sony put out a compilation of Jackson's number-one hits on CD and DVD, titled ''[[Number Ones (Michael Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'', which sold over six million copies worldwide.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 631</ref> In the US it peaked at number 13 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.<ref name="RIAA certifications"/> At the same time, Jackson was charged with seven counts of [[child molestation]] and two counts of [[Alcoholic beverage#Legal considerations|administering an intoxicating agent]] in order to commit that felony; all charges regarded the same boy, [[Gavin Arvizo]], who was under 14 at the time of the alleged crime. Earlier that year, a [[Granada Television]] [[Living with Michael Jackson|documentary]] featuring Jackson showed him holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with Arvizo, who would later accuse him of child sexual abuse.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 640</ref> In the same documentary Jackson was observed spending large amounts of money in an apparently frivolous manner, when he spent six&nbsp;million in a single store.<ref name="usatoday finances"/> 

Jackson denied the sexual abuse allegations, saying that the sleepovers were in no way sexual in nature. Jackson's friend Elizabeth Taylor defended him on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', saying that she had been there when they "were in the bed, watching television. There was nothing abnormal about it. There was no touchy-feely going on. We laughed like children and we watched a lot of Walt Disney. There was nothing odd about it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/30/lkl.01.html |title=Elizabeth Taylor defends Michael on Larry King Live |publisher=CNN |date= 2006-05-30 |accessdate= 2006-11-11 }}</ref> During the investigation, Jackson's profile were examined by a mental health professional called Dr. Stan Katz; the doctor spent several hours with the accuser too. The assessment made by Katz, was that Jackson had become a regressed 10-year-old and did not fit the profile of a pedophile.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 648</ref> 

Following his upcoming trial, Jackson became dependent on [[morphine]] and [[Demerol]], which he subsequently overcame.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 661</ref> The [[People v.

{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}
Jackson has been singing since a child, and over time his voice and vocal style have notably changed, either through puberty or a personal preference to align his vocal interpretation to the themes and genres he chooses to express. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson's voice "descended ever so slightly from boy soprano to his current androgynous high tenor".<ref name="rollingstone"/> In the mid-1970s, the singer adopted a "vocal hiccup" as seen in "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]". The purpose of the hiccup<U+2014>somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping<U+2014>is to help promote a certain emotion; be it excitement, sadness or fear.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/> With the arrival of ''Off the Wall'' in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Allmusic described him as a "blindingly gifted vocalist".<ref name="AMG OTW"/> At the time, ''Rolling Stone'' compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of [[Stevie Wonder]]. They also reached the analysis that, "Jackson's feathery-timbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling [[falsetto]] that's used very daringly".<ref name="RS OTW"/> 1982 saw the released of ''Thriller'', ''Rolling Stone'' were of the opinion that Jackson was then singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".<ref name="RS Thriller"/> 

The release of "Bad" in 1987 displayed gritty lead vocals on the verse and lighter tones employed on the chorus.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 23"/> The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the paradoxical, introspective album ''Dangerous'', here Jackson used his vocals to intensify the split themes and genres described earlier. ''The New York Times'' noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone".<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals.<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> "In the Closet" contained heavy breathing and a loop of five scat-sung syllables, whereas in the albums title track, Jackson performs a spoken rap.<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/><ref name = "Nelson George overview 24"/> When commenting on ''Invincible'', ''Rolling Stone'' were of the opinion that<U+2014>at the age of 43<U+2014>Jackson still performed, "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".<ref name="RS Invincible">{{cite web |first=James |last=Hunter |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/albums/album/301517/review/5945685/invincible |title=Michael Jackson: Invincible |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date=[[2001-12-06]] |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}</ref> Nelson George summed by Jackson's vocals as, "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness<U+2014>that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist".<ref name = "Nelson George overview 24"/>
