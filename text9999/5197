The '''Pores of Kohn''' are pores between adjacent [[alveoli]], or interalveolar connections. They function as a means of collateral ventilation; that is, if the lung is partially deflated, ventilation can occur to some extent through these pores. The pores also allow the passage of other materials such as fluid and bacteria.

The Pores of Kohn take their name from the German physician Hans Kohn [1866-1935] who first described them in [[1893]] <ref>H.N. Kohn: <U+201C>Zur Histologie der indurierenden fibrin<U+00F6>sen Pneumonie<U+201D>. M<U+00FC>nchener Medicinische Wochenschrift 1893 40: 42-45</ref>.
