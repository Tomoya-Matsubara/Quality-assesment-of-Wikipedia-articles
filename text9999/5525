He later proceeded to Annunciation school, Ikere-Ekiti (1969-1973), before attending the famous Christ School, [[Ado-Ekiti]] (1973-1975).
Adeyeye holds a Bachelors Degree in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of Ibadan]] (1978), a Masters Degree in [[Political Science]] (International Relations) from the [[University of Lagos]] (1981). He also obtained a Law Degree from the [[University of Lagos]] in 1986 and was called to the Nigerian Bar in 1987.

== Professional Career ==

His work experience has spanned three major professional fields - teaching, journalism and legal practice.

== In Nigerian Politics ==

As a pro-democracy activist, he was a member of the [[National Democratic Coalition]] (NADECO).
He was Director of Publicity, Falae for President Campaign Organisation (1990-1992), Adviser on policy and Press Matters, M.K.O. Abiola for President Campaign Organisation (1993), spokesperson for the Alliance for Democracy (AD), and a member of the South-West Delegation to the Nigerian leaders of Thought Conference, Abuja (2001)<ref>''The Nation Newspaper'' (July 22, 2007).[http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=25818].</ref>
He was also the National Publicity secretary of the Pan Yoruba Socio-political group, [[Afenifere]] between 2001-2004 as well as the spokesperson of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) between 2004-2006. 

In 2006, he was an Ekiti State governorship aspirant under Alliance for Democracy (AD), which later metamorphosed into the Action Congress of Nigeria, and was runner up to Governor Kayode Fayemi in the controversial primary elections that led to the defection of 13 of the total 16 aspirants from the Action Congress of Nigeria to the [[People's Democratic Party]] (PDP). Prince Adeyeye was among those who defected.

After the 2007 election, he was nominated for a position as a minister of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]] under the President [[Umaru Musa Yaradua]] administration, but his past roles as spokesperson for the opposition party and the National Publicity secretary of the Afenifere group worked against his final appointment as minister.<ref>''The Nation Newspaper'' (September 20, 2007)

He was subsequently appointed Executive Chairman of Ekiti State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) under the Administration of Governor Segun Oni, where he recorded several achievements and won the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) award as the best chairman in the South-West of Nigeria in 2009. The Seventy Million Naira award was used to provide more infrastructure for schools across Ekiti State.<ref>''The Nigerian Voice Newspaper'' (September 9, 2013).[http://www.thenigerianvoice.com/nvnews/123834/1/ekiti-2014-as-adeyeye-becomes-the-issue.html]</ref> That same year, Prince Adedayo Adeyeye was adjudged the most innovative SUBEB chairman in Nigeria by the Presidential Committee on Schools<U+2019> debate and also won the prize as the best performing SUBEB Chairman in the South-West of Nigeria. His administration successfully organised the training of over 12,000 teachers within Ekiti State on contemporary teaching methods. <ref>''News Nigeria Online'' (March 28, 2009)[http://newsnigeria.onlinenigeria.com/templates/?a=1111]</ref>
As chairman of Ekiti SUBEB, Adeyeye changed the face of public school buildings in the State with the introduction of storey buildings and tiled floors and provision of school furniture. During his tenure as SUBEB chairman, pupils stopped carrying furniture to school from their homes.
