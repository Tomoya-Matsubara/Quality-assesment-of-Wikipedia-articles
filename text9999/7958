The '''rainbow trout''' (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') is a species of [[salmonid]] native to cold-water [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. The steelhead (sometimes "steelhead trout") is an [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] (sea-run) form of the coastal rainbow trout {{nowrap|(''O. m. irideus'')}} or [[Columbia River redband trout]] {{nowrap|(''O. m. gairdneri'')}} that usually returns to fresh water to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] after living two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] into the [[Great Lakes]] and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.

Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between {{convert|1|and|5|lb|1|abbr=on}}, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach {{convert|20|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}. Coloration varies widely based on [[subspecies]], forms and [[habitat]]. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral line]], from [[gill]]s to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.

Wild-caught and [[Fish hatchery|hatchery]]-reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), [[Southern Europe]], Australia and [[South America]] have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may impact native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as [[whirling disease]]), or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. Other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created world-class [[Recreational fishing|sport fisheries]] such as the Great Lakes and [[Wyoming]]'s [[Firehole River]].

Some local populations of specific subspecies, or in the case of steelhead, [[distinct population segment]]s, are listed as either [[threatened species|threatened]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The steelhead is the official [[state fish]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/symbols/pages/default.aspx |title=Symbols of Washington State |publisher=Washington State Legislature |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref><!-- note web site specifies Salmo gairdnerii, just to further confuse matters -->

[[John Richardson (naturalist)|Sir John Richardson]], a Scottish naturalist, named a specimen of this species {{nowrap|''Salmo gairdneri''}} in 1836 to honor Meredith Gairdner, a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] surgeon at [[Fort Vancouver]] on the [[Columbia River]] who provided Richardson with specimens.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/faunaborealiamer03rich |title=Fauna Boreali-Americana, or, The Zoology of the Northern Parts of British America: Containing Descriptions of the Objects of Natural History Collected on the Late Northern Land Expeditions, Under Command of Captain Sir John Franklin, R.N.

==Description==
Resident freshwater rainbow trout adults average between {{convert|1|and|5|lbs|kg|abbr=on}} in riverine environments, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach {{convert|20|lbs|abbr=on}}.  Coloration varies widely between regions and subspecies. Adult freshwater forms are generally blue-green or olive green with heavy black spotting over the length of the body.  Adult fish have a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most pronounced in breeding males.<ref name=Behnke2002/> The [[caudal fin]] is squarish and only mildly forked. Lake-dwelling and anadromous forms are usually more silvery in color with the reddish stripe almost completely gone.  Juvenile rainbow trout display parr marks (dark vertical bars) typical of most salmonid juveniles. In some redband and golden trout forms parr marks are typically retained into adulthood.<ref name=Behnke2002-88>{{cite book |last=Behnke |first=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert J.

Freshwater resident rainbow trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with [[gravel]] bottoms. They are native to the [[River#Topographical classification|alluvial]] or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as [[bedrock]] and [[spring creek]]s. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/60290.html |title=Steelhead Fishing in Lake Erie Tributaries |publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation |accessdate=2014-02-03}}</ref>

Spawning sites are usually a bed of fine gravel in a [[riffle]] above a pool. A female trout clears a [[Spawn (biology)#Brood hiders|redd]] in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down. Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 {{convert|4|to|5|mm|inch|adj=on}} eggs per kilogram of weight.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mechanisms Controlling Egg Size and Number in Rainbow Trout ''Oncorhynchus mykiss'' |url=http://www.biolreprod.org/content/54/1/8.full.pdf |authors=Tyler, C.R; Pottinger, T.G.; Santos, E.; Sumpter,J.P.; Price, S-A; Brooks, S.; Nagler, J.J. |journal=Biology of Reproduction |volume=54 |year=1996 |pages=8<U+2013>15}}</ref> During spawning, the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel, and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest, covering the eggs with the displaced gravel.  As eggs are released by the female, a male moves alongside and deposits milt (sperm) over the eggs to fertilize them. The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat. Newly hatched trout are called sac-fry or alevin. In approximately two weeks, the [[yolk sac]] is completely consumed and [[Fry (biology)|fry]] commence feeding mainly on [[zooplankton]]. The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area, habitat, life history and quality and quantity of food.<ref name=fwsRainbow>{{cite web |last=Staley|first=Kathryn|coauthor=Mueller, John|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/wssnfh/pdfs/rainbow1.pdf |title=Rainbow Trout (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |date= May 2000|format=PDF |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref> As fry grow, they begin to develop "parr" marks or dark vertical bars on their sides. In this juvenile stage, immature trout are often called "parr" because of the marks. These small juvenile trout are sometimes called fingerlings because they are approximately the size of a human finger.  In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no natural reproduction occurs, some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or "carryover" for several seasons before they are caught or perish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/trout/streamclassification.html |title=Wisconsin Trout Fishing: Trout Stream Classifications |date=January 27, 2014 |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2014-01-03}}</ref>

===Steelhead life cycle===
{{see also|Salmon run}}
The oceangoing (anadromous) form, including those returning for spawning, are known as steelhead in Canada and the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|title=Steelhead/Rainbow Trout Species Profile|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=steelhead.main|accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref> In [[Tasmania]] they are commercially propagated in [[Aquaculture of salmon#Sea cages|sea cages]] and are known as '''ocean trout''', although they are the same species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mesa.edu.au/aquaculture/aquaculture14.asp |title=Mariculture in Tasmania Ocean Trout |publisher=Marine Education Association of Australasia |accessdate=2014-02-23}}</ref>

Like [[salmon]], steelhead return to their original hatching grounds to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].

Juvenile steelhead may remain in the river for one to three years before smolting and migrating to sea. Individual steelhead populations leave the ocean and [[Fish migration|migrate]] into their freshwater spawning tributaries at different times of the year. Two general forms exist&mdash;"summer-run steelhead" and "winter-run steelhead". Summer-run fish leave the ocean between May and October, before their reproductive organs are fully mature. They mature in fresh water while en route to spawning grounds where they spawn in the spring. Summer-run fish generally spawn in longer, more inland rivers such as the Columbia River. Winter-run fish are ready to spawn when they leave the ocean, typically between November and April, and spawn shortly after returning to fresh water.  Winter-run fish generally spawn in shorter, coastal rivers typically found along the [[Olympic Peninsula]] and British Columbia coastline,<ref name=Behnke2002-68/> and summer-run fish are found in some shorter, coastal streams.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/salmon/steelhead.html |title=Recreational Salmon Fishing Salmon/Steelhead Species Information Steelhead (Rainbow Trout) ''Oncorhynchus mykiss'' |publisher=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> Once steelhead enter riverine systems and reach suitable spawning grounds, they spawn just like resident freshwater rainbow trout.<ref name=Behnke2002-68>{{cite book |last=Behnke |first=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert J.

==Feeding==
Rainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as [[Piscivore|piscivorous]] or aggressive as brown trout or [[Salvelinus|chars]]. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically [[Caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mayflies]] and aquatic [[fly|diptera]]).  They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, [[crayfish]], shrimp, and other [[crustacean]]s. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become [[plankton]]ic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, [[mountain whitefish]] and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish.  Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, [[squid]] and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |format= PDF |title=BC Fish Facts-Steelhead |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Fisheries |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref>

==Artificial propagation==
[[File:Raceways.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photo of raceways as at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish hatchery|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish hatchery]]
Since 1870, rainbow trout have been artificially propagated in [[hatchery|fish hatcheries]] to restock streams and to introduce them into non-native waters. The first rainbow trout hatchery was established on [[San Leandro Creek]], a tributary of [[San Francisco Bay]], in 1870, and trout production began in 1871. The hatchery was stocked with the locally native rainbow trout, and likely steelhead of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies {{nowrap|(''O. m. irideus'')}}. The fish raised in this hatchery were shipped to hatcheries out of state for the first time in 1875, to [[Caledonia, New York]], and then in 1876 to [[Northville, Michigan]]. In 1877, another California rainbow trout hatchery, the first federal fish hatchery in the [[National Fish Hatchery System]], was established on Campbell Creek, a [[McCloud River]] tributary.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schley|first=Ben|url=http://nctc.fws.gov/History/Articles/FisheriesHistory.html |title=A Century of Fish Conservation (1871<U+2013>1971) |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=2009-05-21|accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> The McCloud River hatchery indiscriminately mixed coastal rainbow trout eggs with the eggs of local [[McCloud River redband|McCloud River redband trout]] {{nowrap|(''O. m. stonei'')}}.

===Steelhead declines===
{{see also|Steelhead and salmon distinct population segments|Conservation status of British Columbia salmonids}}
Steelhead populations in parts of its native range have declined due to a variety of human and natural causes. While populations in Alaska and along the British Columbia coast are considered healthy, populations in Kamchatka and some populations along the U.S. west coast are in decline.
The U.S. [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] has 15 identified [[distinct population segment]]s (DPS)s, in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]]. Eleven of these DPSs are listed under the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]], ten as threatened and one as endangered.<ref name=noaa>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/fish/steelheadtrout.htm |title=Steelhead Trout (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') |publisher=NOAA Fisheries, Office of Protected Resources |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref> One DPS on the Oregon Coast is designated a U.S. [[Species of Concern]].<ref name=noaa/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.water.ca.gov/fishpassage/docs/b250/B250_app_D.pdf |title=Appendix D Evolutionarily Significant Units, Critical Habitat, and Essential Fish Habitat |publisher=California Department of Water Resources |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>

Releases of conventionally reared hatchery steelhead pose ecological risks to wild steelhead populations. Hatchery steelhead are typically larger than the wild forms and can displace wild-form juveniles from optimal habitats. Dominance of hatchery steelhead for optimal microhabitats within streams may reduce wild steelhead survival as a result of reduced foraging opportunity and increased rates of predation.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1999 |title=Behavioral Interactions Among Hatchery-reared Steelhead Smolts and Wild ''Oncorhynchus mykiss'' in Natural Streams |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management 19 |pages=948<U+2013>956 |author=McMichael, G.

Rainbow trout and steelhead are highly regarded game fish. Rainbow trout are a popular target for [[fly fishing|fly fishers]], and several [[angling]] methods are used. The use of [[Fishing lure|lures]] presented via spinning, casting or trolling techniques is common. Rainbow trout can also be caught on various [[live food|live]] and dead natural baits. The [[International Game Fish Association]] recognizes the world record for rainbow trout as a fish caught on [[Saskatchewan]]'s [[Lake Diefenbaker]] by Sean Konrad on September&nbsp;5, 2009.

The highly desirable sporting qualities and adaptability of the rainbow trout to hatchery rearing and new habitats resulted in it being introduced to many countries around the world by or at the behest of sport fishermen.

The color and flavor of the flesh depends on the diet and freshness of the trout.  Farmed trout and some populations of wild trout, especially anadromous steelhead, have reddish or orange flesh as a result of high [[astaxanthin]] levels in their diets. Astaxanthin is a powerful [[antioxidant]] that may be from a natural source or a synthetic trout feed.  Rainbow trout raised to have pinker flesh from a diet high in astaxanthin are sometimes sold in the U.S. with labeling calling them "steelhead".<ref name=Harlow>{{cite web |title=Dependable, Delectable Rainbow Trout |author=Harlow, Jay |publisher=Sally's Place|url=http://www.sallybernstein.com/food/columns/harlow/rainbow_trout.htm |accessdate=2013-11-28}}</ref>  As wild steelhead are in decline in some parts of their range, farmed rainbow are viewed as a preferred alternative.<ref name=Monterey/>  In Chile and Norway, rainbow trout farmed in saltwater sea cages are sold labeled as steelhead.<ref name="Seafood Watch"/>

Trout can be cooked as soon as they are cleaned, without scaling, skinning or filleting.<ref name=Wright/> If cooked with the skin on, the meat tends to hold together better.<ref name=Harlow/>  While trout sold commercially in Europe is often prepared and served this way, most trout sold commercially in the U.S. have had heads removed and have been fully or partially deboned and filleted.
