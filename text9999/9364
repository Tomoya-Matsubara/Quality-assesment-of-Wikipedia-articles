'''''<U+0160>olta''''' ([[pennant number]] OB-02) is a [[Mirna-class patrol boat|''Mirna''-class]] patrol boat in service with the [[Croatian Navy]]. Completed during the 1980s as P<U+010C>-176 ''Mukos'', it was the sixth ship of a class that was being built for the [[Yugoslav Navy]] in the Kraljevica Shipyard.

During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], ''Mukos'' was part of a tactical group tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. On 14 November, Croatian Navy commandos disabled it with an improvised torpedo, leaving the vessel drifting and abandoned by its crew. The crippled ship was then tugged away by Croatian locals to the nearby island of [[<U+0160>olta]]. It was subsequently repaired and entered service with the Croatian Navy as ''<U+0160>olta''. As of 2014, it remains in service with the [[Croatian Coast Guard]], an integral part of the Navy.

== Design and construction ==
{{Main|Mirna-class patrol boat}}
''<U+0160>olta'' was laid down as ''Mukos'' (P<U+010C>-176) in the [[Kraljevica Shipyard]] as the sixth ship in a class of patrol boats that were being built for the [[Yugoslav Navy]] (JRM). It was launched on 18 November 1982.{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=163}} It measures {{convert|32|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, has a draught of {{convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|6.75|m|ft|abbr=on}} beam and a standard displacement of {{convert|125|t|LT}} or {{convert|142|t|LT}} when full.{{sfn|Brodarski institut - Fast Patrol Craft Mirna}}

Powered by two [[SEMT Pielstick]] 12PA4 200VGDS diesel engines that spin two propellers, ''<U+0160>olta'' has a maximum speed of {{convert|29.5|-|30|kn}} and a continuous speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. It has a range of {{convert|600|nmi}} at {{convert|15|kn}} and an autonomy of four to five days that can be extended to eight days during wartime.{{sfn|Brodarski institut - Fast Patrol Craft Mirna}}{{sfn|Wertheim|2007|p=146}}{{sfn|Alan Agency}}

The ship's original armament consisted of a single [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm D70 gun]] mounted on the ship's bow, a quadruple [[Strela 2]] launcher behind the bridge and a quad 20&nbsp;mm M-75 gun on the stern. Eight MDB-MT3 [[depth charge]]s could be carried for [[anti-submarine warfare]] duties.{{sfn|Wertheim|2007|p=146}} Located on the sides were two double-barrel 128&nbsp;mm [[battlefield illumination|illumination]] launchers.{{sfn|Saunders|2004|p=163}}{{sfn|Brodarski institut - Fast Patrol Craft Mirna}} Sensors included a [[Decca Radar|Racal Decca]] RM 1216 A surface search radar and a [[Simrad Yachting|Simrad]] SQ 3D/SF sonar.{{sfn|Brodarski institut - Fast Patrol Craft Mirna}}

== Service ==
During its service in the Yugoslav Navy, ''Mukos'' was part of the border patrol detachment.{{sfn|Gardiner|1995|p=648}}{{sfn|<U+0160>vel|13 August 2012}} In November 1991, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]], ''Mukos'' was part of the "Ka<U+0161>tela" tactical group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17:30, while on patrol in the Split [[strait]] between the islands of Bra<U+010D> and <U+0160>olta, ''Mukos'' was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy (HRM), effectively starting the [[Battle of the Dalmatian Channels]]. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to sink and killing three crew members. The remaining crew was rescued by a [[Shershen-class torpedo boat|''Shershen''-class]] torpedo boat ''Pionir II'' (T<U+010C>-224) while ''Mukos'' itself was left adrift.{{sfn|Bernardi<U+0107>|15 November 2004}}{{sfn|Dadi<U+0107>|16 November 2013}}
[[File:OB-02 <U+0160>olta (prova).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ship's bow with the 40 mm Bofors gun and the ship's bridge visible]]
During the night of 15 November the ship was tugged away by a Croatian fishing ship to the nearby Ne<U+010D>ujam cove], where it was beached to prevent it from sinking. In the early hours of the same day, the remaining JRM ships opened fire in retaliation for damaging ''Mukos''. As Yugoslav forces left the area, the ship was towed to an overhauling shipyard in [[<U+0160>ibenik]] on the night of 17/18 November, after being salvaged by HRM divers with the help of Brodospas.{{sfn|Bernardi<U+0107>|15 November 2004}}{{sfn|Dadi<U+0107>|16 November 2013}}{{sfn|OSRH}} The ship was repaired and renamed ''<U+0160>olta'', entering service with the HRM on 15 May 1992 with Mile Tomas in command.{{sfn|OSRH}}

The [[Croatian Coast Guard]] was formed in October 2007, and ''<U+0160>olta'' was assigned to the 1st Division, based in Split.{{sfn|Urli<U+0107>|May 2010}} During the same year the ship underwent a modernisation that included the installation of a new Sperry Marine surface search radar, [[gyrocompass]] and [[GPS]].{{sfn|Godi<U+0161>nje izvje<U+0161><U+0107>e}}  A second refit that occurred sometime between 2007 and 2013 included the deletion of the Strela launcher and the stern 20&nbsp;mm M-75 gun to create space needed for a [[RHIB]] and a hydraulic crane used to lower it into the sea. The pennant number was changed from OB-62 to OB-02.{{sfn|Vlahovi<U+0107>|April 2013}}
