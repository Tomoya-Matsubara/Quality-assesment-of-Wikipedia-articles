In [[chess]], the '''English Opening''' is the [[chess opening|opening]] where White plays
:1. [[Wikibooks:Opening theory in chess/1. c4|c4]]
A [[flank opening]], it is the fourth most popular opening.<ref name="shredder_opening">{{cite web |url=http://www.shredderchess.com/online-chess/online-databases/opening-database.html |title=Opening Database |accessdate=2008-01-19 |last=Meyer-Kahlen |first=Stefan |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/explorer |title=Chess Opening Explorer |accessdate=2008-01-19 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Chessgames.com}}</ref> White begins the fight for the center by staking a claim to the d5 square. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, it often transposes into other openings and is considered flexible.

The English derives its name from the [[England|English]] (unofficial) [[World Chess Champion|world champion]], [[Howard Staunton]], who played it during his 1843 match with [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]]. It fell out of favor (the opening was notably disdained by [[Paul Morphy|Morphy]]), but is now recognized as a solid opening that may be used to reach both classical and [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodern]] positions. [[Mikhail Botvinnik|Botvinnik]], [[Karpov]], and [[Kasparov]] all employed it during their world championship matches. [[Bobby Fischer]] created a stir when he switched to it from the [[King's Pawn Game|King's Pawn]] against [[Boris Spassky]] in 1972.

==Transpositional Potential==
If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the [[Queen's Gambit]] or an [[Indian defence]].
For example, after 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.d4 d5 the game has transposed into the [[Gr<U+00FC>nfeld Defence]], usually reached by the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5.

Note, however, that White can also play 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.e4 making it impossible for Black to reach a Gr<U+00FC>nfeld, and instead more or less forcing him to defend a [[King's Indian Defence]] with 3...d6. Black also cannot force a Gr<U+00FC>nfeld with 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5, since White can deviate with 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.g3.

Instead of playing an early d4, White can also play Nf3 and [[fianchetto]] the [[king (chess)|king's]] [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] (g3 and Bg2), transposing into a [[Reti Opening]].

Also, after 1.c4 c6, white can transpose into the [[Polish Opening]], Outflank Variation, by playing 2.b4!?, which can be used as a surprise weapon if Black does not know very much about the Polish Opening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jeremysilman.com/book_reviews_js/js_dynamic_english.html |title=The Dynamic English |accessdate=2008-01-19 |last=Silman |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Silman|coauthors= |date=2004 |work= |publisher=}}</ref>

The many different transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against, and make it advisable for him to consider carefully what [[transposition (chess)|move order]] to employ. For instance, if Black would like to play a [[Queen's Gambit Declined]], the most accurate move order to do so is 1...e6 2.d4 d5. (Of course, White can again play the Reti instead with 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3.) If Black plays instead 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 e6, White can avoid the QGD by playing 3.e4 instead.

==Common responses==
Common responses include:<ref name="shredder_opening"/><br />
:'''1...Nf6'''. <br />
:'''1...e5''' White has black's position in the Sicilian but with a [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] up. This is often called the reverse-[[Sicilian Defence|Sicilian]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa05i17_2.htm |title=Chess Opening Tutorial : English - 1...e5 |accessdate=2008-01-19 |last=Weeks |first=Mark |authorlinks=Mark Weeks|coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=About, Inc.}}</ref> Bruce Leverett, writing the English chapter in MCO14, stated, "It is natural to treat the English as a Sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising--main lines in the Sicilian Defense correspond to obscure side variations in the English, and vice versa."<br />
:'''1...e6''' (Can lead to a [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] after 2.d4 d5, but White usually prefers 2.Nf3, 2.Nc3 or 2.g3)<br />
:'''1...c5''' (the ''Symmetrical Variation'') including attempts to try the [[Hedgehog (chess)|Hedgehog system]]<ref>{{cite book | last=De Firmian |first=Nick|authorlink=Nick de Firmian | title=[[Modern Chess Openings]]: MCO-14 | publisher=David McKay Co. | year=1999 | location=New York|isbn=0812930843|pages=pp.661-665}}</ref><br />
:'''1...g6'''. <br />
:'''1...c6''' (Can lead to a [[Slav Defense|Slav Defence]] after 2.d4 d5, but White usually prefers a [[Caro-Kann Defence]] with 2.e4 d5, or a [[Reti Opening]] after 2.Nf3 d5).<br />
:'''1...b6''' The [[English Defence]]. This setup involves the fianchetto of the quenside bishop and 2...e6. Often ...f6 and ...Qh4 will be played. [[Anthony Miles]] and [[Jonathan Speelman]] used this opening successfully in recent years.<br /><br />
