The '''Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon''' ({{lang-la|Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici}}), commonly known as the '''Knights Templar''', the '''Order of the Temple''' ({{lang-fr|Ordre du Temple'' or ''Templiers}}) or simply as '''Templars''', were among the most wealthy and powerful of the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] [[military order]]s<ref name=Barber>Malcolm Barber, ''The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1994. ISBN 0-521-42041-5.</ref> and were among the most prominent actors of the [[Christian finance]]. The organization existed for nearly two centuries during the [[Middle Ages]].

Officially endorsed by the [[Catholic Church]] around 1129, the Order became a favoured charity throughout [[Christendom]] and grew rapidly in membership and power. Templar knights, in their distinctive white [[Mantle (vesture)|mantles]] with a red [[Christian cross|cross]], were among the most skilled fighting units of the [[Crusades]].<ref name=HC/> Non-combatant members of the Order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom,<ref>{{cite book|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=Knights of the Cloister.

The Templars' existence was tied closely to the Crusades; when the [[Holy Land]] was lost, support for the Order faded. Rumours about the Templars' secret initiation ceremony created mistrust and King [[Philip IV of France]], deeply in debt to the Order, took advantage of the situation. In 1307, many of the Order's members in France were arrested, tortured into giving [[false confession]]s, and then [[death by burning|burned at the stake]].<ref name=Barber-trial>Malcolm Barber, ''The Trial of the Templars''. Cambridge University Press, 1978. ISBN 0-521-45727-0.</ref> Under pressure from King Philip, [[Pope Clement V]] disbanded the Order in 1312. The abrupt disappearance of a major part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends, which have kept the "Templar" name alive into the modern day.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Knights Templar}}

===Rise===
After the [[First Crusade]] recaptured [[Jerusalem]] in 1099, many [[Christians]] made [[pilgrimages]] to various [[Holy Places]] in the [[Holy Land]]. However, though the city of Jerusalem was under relatively secure control, the rest of [[Outremer]] was not. Bandits and marauding [[highwaymen]] abounded, targeting and preying upon pilgrims who were routinely slaughtered, sometimes by the hundreds, as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline at [[Jaffa]] into the interior of the Holy Land.<ref>[[#Burman|Burman]], pp. 13, 19.</ref>

In 1120, the French knight [[Hugues de Payens]] approached King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] and [[Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem]] and proposed creating a [[monasticism|monastic]] order for the protection of these pilgrims. King Baldwin and Patriarch Warmund agreed to the request, probably at the [[Council of Nablus]] in January 1120, and the king granted the Templars a headquarters in a wing of the royal palace on the [[Temple Mount]] in the captured [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=Birth of the Order|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/birth-of-the-order/|accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref>  The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what was believed to be the ruins of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]].<ref name=HC>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Decoding the Past: The Templar Code'', 7 November 2005, video documentary written by Marcy Marzuni.</ref><ref>Barber, ''The New Knighthood'', p. 7.</ref> The Crusaders therefore referred to the Al Aqsa Mosque as Solomon's Temple, and it was from this location that the new Order took the name of ''Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon'', or "Templar" knights. The Order, with about nine knights including [[Godfrey de Saint-Omer]] and [[Andr<U+00E9> de Montbard]], had few financial resources and relied on donations to survive. Their emblem was of two knights riding on a single horse, emphasising the Order's poverty.<ref>Read, ''The Templars''. p. 91.</ref>

[[File:Temple mount.JPG|thumb|left|The first headquarters of the Knights Templar, on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem. The Crusaders called it the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]] and from this location derived their name of Templar.]]

The impoverished status of the Templars did not last long. They had a powerful advocate in Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], a leading Church figure, French abbot primarily responsible for the founding of the [[Cistercian Order]] of monks and a nephew of Andr<U+00E9> de Montbard, one of the founding knights. Bernard put his weight behind them and wrote persuasively on their behalf in the letter 'In Praise of the New Knighthood',<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=The Knights Templar 4: St Bernard of Clairvaux|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/the-knights-templar-4-st-bernard-of-clairvaux/|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title='Quidam autem dubitaverunt: the Saint, the Sinner and a Possible Chronology', in Autour de la Premi<U+00E8>re Croisade|year=1996|publisher=Publications de la Sorbonne|location=Paris|isbn=2859443088|pages=221<U+2013>230}}</ref> and in 1129, at the [[Council of Troyes]], he led a group of leading churchmen to officially approve and endorse the Order on behalf of the Church. With this formal blessing, the Templars became a favoured charity throughout [[Christendom]], receiving money, land, businesses, and noble-born sons from families who were eager to help with the fight in the [[Holy Land]]. Another major benefit came in 1139, when [[Pope Innocent II]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Omne Datum Optimum]]'' exempted the Order from obedience to local laws. This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders, were not required to pay any taxes, and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope.<ref>[[#Burman|Burman]], p. 40.</ref>

With its clear mission and ample resources, the Order grew rapidly. Templars were often the advance [[shock troops]] in key battles of the Crusades, as the heavily armoured knights on their [[horses in warfare|warhorses]] would set out to [[Cavalry tactics#Tactics of heavy cavalry using lances|charge]] at the enemy, ahead of the main army bodies, in an attempt to break opposition lines. One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during the [[Battle of Montgisard]], where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeat [[Saladin]]'s army of more than 26,000 soldiers.<ref name=Worlds>The History Channel, ''Lost Worlds: Knights Templar'', July 10, 2006, video documentary written and directed by Stuart Elliott.</ref>

{{quote box|align=right|bgcolor=#F9F9F9|width=20%|quote=A Templar Knight is truly a fearless knight, and secure on every side, for his soul is protected by the armour of faith, just as his body is protected by the armour of steel.

Dafoe | url=http://www.templarhistory.com/praise.html|title= In Praise of the New Knighthood| publisher= TemplarHistory.com | accessdate=March 20, 2007}}</ref>}}

Although the primary mission of the Order was military, relatively few members were combatants. The others acted in support positions to assist the knights and to manage the financial infrastructure. The Templar Order, though its members were sworn to individual poverty, was given control of wealth beyond direct donations. A nobleman who was interested in participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he was away. Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer, the Order in 1150 began generating [[letter of credit|letters of credit]] for pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land: pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value. This innovative arrangement was an early form of [[banking]] and may have been the first formal system to support the use of [[cheque]]s; it improved the safety of pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for thieves, and also contributed to the Templar coffers.<ref name=HC/><ref name=Martin/>

Based on this mix of donations and business dealing, the Templars established financial networks across the whole of Christendom. They acquired large tracts of land, both in Europe and the Middle East; they bought and managed farms and vineyards; they built churches and castles; they were involved in manufacturing, import and export; they had their own fleet of ships; and at one point they even owned the entire island of [[Cyprus]]. The Order of the Knights Templar arguably qualifies as the world's first [[multinational corporation]].<ref name=Worlds/><ref>{{cite book|author=Ralls, Karen|title=Knights Templar Encyclopedia|page=28|publisher=Career Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-56414-926-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Inside Secret Societies|author=Benson, Michael|page=90|publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp.|year=2005}}</ref>

===Decline===
[[File:Hattin.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hattin|Battle of the Horns of Hattin]] in 1187, the turning point in the Crusades]]
In the mid-12th century, the tide began to turn in the Crusades. The [[Muslim]] world had become more united under effective leaders such as [[Saladin]], and dissension arose among Christian factions in, and concerning, the Holy Land. The Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian [[military order]]s, the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]], and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions, both politically and militarily. After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns, including the pivotal [[Battle of Hattin|Battle of the Horns of Hattin]], Jerusalem was recaptured by Muslim forces under Saladin in 1187. The Crusaders regained the city in 1229, without Templar aid, but held it only briefly. In 1244, the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarezmi Turks]] recaptured Jerusalem, and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] captured it from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in [[World War One]].<ref>Martin, p. 99.</ref>

The Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the north, such as the seaport of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which they held for the next century.  It was lost in 1291, followed by their last mainland strongholds, [[Tortosa]] ([[Tartus]] in what is now [[Syria]]), and [[Atlit]] in present-day [[Israel]]. Their headquarters then moved to [[Limassol]] on the island of Cyprus,<ref>Martin, p. 113.</ref> and they also attempted to maintain a garrison on tiny [[Arwad Island]], just off the coast from Tortosa. In 1300, there was some attempt to engage in [[Franco-Mongol alliance|coordinated military efforts with the Mongols]]<ref>Demurger, p.139 "During four years, [[Jacques de Molay]] and his order were totally committed, with other Christian forces of Cyprus and Armenia, to an enterprise of reconquest of the Holy Land, in liaison with the offensives of Ghazan, the Mongol Khan of Persia.</ref> via a new invasion force at [[Arwad]]. In 1302 or 1303, however, the Templars lost the island to the Egyptian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] in the [[Siege of Ruad|Siege of Arwad]]. With the island gone, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the Holy Land.<ref name=Worlds/><ref>[[#Nicholson2001|Nicholson]], p. 201. "The Templars retained a base on Arwad island (also known as Ruad island, formerly Arados) off Tortosa (Tartus) until October 1302 or 1303, when the island was recaptured by the Mamluks."</ref>

With the Order's military mission now less important, support for the organisation began to dwindle. The situation was however complex, as over the two hundred years of their existence, the Templars had become a part of daily life throughout Christendom.<ref>[[#Nicholson2001|Nicholson]], p. 5.</ref> The organisation's Templar Houses, hundreds of which were dotted throughout Europe and the [[Near East]], gave them a widespread presence at the local level.<ref name=quantity/> The Templars still managed many businesses, and many Europeans had daily contact with the Templar network, such as by working at a Templar farm or vineyard, or using the Order as a bank in which to store personal valuables. The Order was still not subject to local government, making it everywhere a "state within a state"<U+2014>its [[standing army]], though it no longer had a well-defined mission, could pass freely through all borders. This situation heightened tensions with some European nobility, especially as the Templars were indicating an interest in founding their own [[monastic state]], just as the [[Teutonic Knights]] had done in [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|Prussia]]<ref name=Martin/> and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] were doing with [[Rhodes, Greece|Rhodes]].<ref>[[#Nicholson2001|Nicholson]], p. 237.</ref>

===Arrests, charges and dissolution===

In 1305, the new [[Pope Clement V]], based in Avignon, France during the period known as the [[Great Schism of the West|Great Schism]], sent letters to both the Templar Grand Master [[Jacques de Molay]] and the Hospitaller Grand Master [[Fulk de Villaret]] to discuss the possibility of merging the two Orders. Neither was amenable to the idea, but Pope Clement persisted, and in 1306 he invited both Grand Masters to France to discuss the matter. De Molay arrived first in early 1307, but de Villaret was delayed for several months. While waiting, De Molay and Clement discussed criminal charges that had been made, it seems, two years prior by an ousted Templar and had been taken up by the king of France and his ministers.  It was generally agreed that the charges were false, but Clement sent King [[Philip IV of France]] a written request for assistance in the investigation. According to some historians, King Philip, who was already deeply in debt to the Templars from his [[Philip IV of France#War with the English|war with the English]], decided to seize upon the rumors for his own purposes. He began pressuring the Church to take action against the Order, as a way of freeing himself from his debts.<ref>Barber, ''Trial of the Templars'', 2nd ed. "Recent Historiography on the Dissolution of the Temple". In the second edition of his book, Barber summarises the views of many different historians, with an overview of the modern debate on Philip's precise motives.</ref> Recent studies emphasize the political and religious motivations of the French king. It seems that, with the <U+201C>discovery<U+201D> and repression of the <U+201C>Templars' heresy,<U+201D> the Capetian monarchy claimed for itself the mystic foundations of the papal theocracy. The Temple case was the last step of a process of appropriating these foundations, which had begun with the Franco-papal rift at the time of Boniface VIII. Being the ultimate defender of the Catholic faith, the Capetian king was invested with a Christlike function that put him above the pope: what was at stake in the Templars' trial was the establishment of a "royal theocracy".<ref>*[https://www.academia.edu/4120353/_A_Heresy_of_State._Philip_the_Fair_the_Trial_of_the_Perfidious_Templars_and_the_Pontificalization_of_the_French_Monarchy_in_Journal_of_Medieval_Religious_Cultures_39_2_2013_p._117-148 Julien Th<U+00E9>ry, "Philip the Fair, the Trial of the 'Perfidious Templars' and the Pontificalization of the French Monarchy", in ''Journal of Medieval Religious Culture'', 39/2 (2013), pp. 117-148, online]</ref>

All interrogations were recorded on a thirty metre long parchment (now held at the [[Archives nationales (France)|Archives nationales]] in Paris). The prisoners were coerced to confess that they had spat on the Cross : "Moi Raymond de La F<U+00E8>re, 21 ans, reconnais que (J'ai) crach<U+00E9> trois fois sur la Croix, mais de bouche et pas de coeur" (free translation : "I, Raymond de La F<U+00E8>re, 21 years old, admit that I have spat three times on the Cross, but only from my mouth and not from my heart").  The Templars were accused of idolatry and were suspected of worshipping either a figure known as [[Baphomet]] or a mummified severed head they recovered, amongst other artifacts, at their original headquarters on the Temple Mount that many scholars theorize might have been that of [[John the Baptist]],among other things.<ref>{{cite book|last=Edgeller|first=Johnathan|title=Taking the Templar Habit: Rule, Initiation Ritual, and the Accusations against the Order|year=2010|publisher=Texas Tech University|pages=62<U+2013>66|url=https://dspace.lib.ttu.edu/etd/bitstream/handle/2346/ETD-TTU-2010-08-791/EDGELLER-THESIS.pdf?sequence=4}}</ref>

Relenting to Phillip's demands, Pope Clement then issued the papal bull ''[[Pastoralis Praeeminentiae]]'' on 22 November 1307, which instructed all Christian monarchs in Europe to arrest all Templars and seize their assets.<ref>Martin, p. 118.</ref> Pope Clement called for papal hearings to determine the Templars' guilt or innocence, and once freed of the [[Inquisition|Inquisitors]]' torture, many Templars recanted their confessions. Some had sufficient legal experience to defend themselves in [[Trial of the Knights Templar|the trials]], but in 1310 Philip blocked this attempt, using the previously forced confessions to have dozens of Templars burned at the stake in Paris.<ref>Martin, p. 122.</ref><ref name=Barber-Trial3>Barber, ''Trial'', 1978, p. 3.</ref>

With Philip threatening military action unless the pope complied with his wishes, Pope Clement finally agreed to disband the Order, citing the public scandal that had been generated by the confessions. At the [[Council of Vienne]] in 1312, he issued a series of papal bulls, including ''[[Vox in excelso]]'', which officially dissolved the Order, and ''[[Ad providam]]'', which turned over most Templar assets to the Hospitallers.<ref>Martin, pp. 123<U+2013>124.</ref>

[[File:Templars on Stake.jpg|thumb|Templars being [[death by burning|burned at the stake]].]]

As for the leaders of the Order, the elderly Grand Master [[Jacques de Molay]], who had confessed under torture, retracted his confession. [[Geoffroi de Charney]], Preceptor of [[Normandy]], also retracted his confession and insisted on his innocence. Both men were declared guilty of being relapsed heretics, and they were sentenced to burn alive at the stake in Paris on 18 March 1314. De Molay reportedly remained defiant to the end, asking to be tied in such a way that he could face the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] and hold his hands together in prayer.<ref>Martin, p. 125.</ref> According to legend, he called out from the flames that both Pope Clement and King Philip would soon meet him before [[God]]. His actual words were recorded on the parchment as follows : "Dieu sait qui a tort et a p<U+00E9>ch<U+00E9>. Il va bientot arriver malheur <U+00E0> ceux qui nous ont condamn<U+00E9>s <U+00E0> mort" (free translation : "God knows who is wrong and has sinned. Soon a calamity will occur to those who have condemned us to death").<ref name="Science" />  Pope Clement died only a month later, and King Philip died in a hunting accident before the end of the year.<ref>Martin, p. 140.</ref><ref>[[Malcolm Barber]] has researched this legend and concluded that it originates from ''La Chronique m<U+00E9>trique attribu<U+00E9>e <U+00E0> [[Geoffrey of Paris|Geffroi de Paris]]'', ed. A. Div<U+00E8>rres, Strasbourg, 1956, pages 5711-5742. Geoffrey of Paris was "apparently an eye-witness, who describes Molay as showing no sign of fear and, significantly, as telling those present that God would avenge their deaths". Barber, ''The Trial of The Templars'', page 357, footnote 110, Second edition (Cambridge University Press, 2006). ISBN 0-521-67236-8</ref><ref>In ''The New Knighthood'' Barber referred to a variant of this legend, about how an unspecified Templar had appeared before and denounced Clement V and, when he was about to be executed sometime later, warned that both Pope and King would "within a year and a day be obliged to explain their crimes in the presence of God", found in the work by Ferretto of Vicenza, ''Historia rerum in Italia gestarum ab anno 1250 ad annum usque 1318'' (Malcolm Barber, ''The New Knighthood'', pages 314-315, Cambridge University Press, 1994). ISBN 0-521-55872-7</ref>

With the last of the Order's leaders gone, the remaining Templars around Europe were either arrested and tried under the Papal investigation (with virtually none convicted), absorbed into other military orders such as the [[Knights Hospitaller]], or pensioned off and allowed to live out their days peacefully. By papal decree, the property of the Templars was transferred to the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Hospitallers]], which also absorbed many of the Templars' members.  In effect, the dissolution of the Templars could be seen as the merger of the two rival orders.<ref>{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|title=The Knights Templars}}</ref> Some may have fled to other territories outside Papal control, such as [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Scotland or to [[Switzerland]]. Templar organisations in Portugal simply changed their name, from Knights Templar to ''[[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Knights of Christ]]''.<ref>Martin, pp. 140<U+2013>142.</ref>

In September 2001, a document known as the "[[Chinon Parchment]]" dated 17<U+2013>20 August 1308 was discovered in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] by [[Barbara Frale]], apparently after having been filed in the wrong place in 1628.

The current position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is that the medieval persecution of the Knights Templar was unjust, that nothing was inherently wrong with the Order or its Rule, and that Pope Clement was pressed into his actions by the magnitude of the public [[Scandal (theology)|scandal]] and by the dominating influence of King Philip IV, who was Clement's relative.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/12/knights.pardon.ap/index.html | publisher=CNN | date=October 12, 2007 | accessdate=October 12, 2007 | title=Knights Templar secrets revealed| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013025546/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/12/knights.pardon.ap/index.html| archivedate = October 13, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

==Organization==
{{main|List of Knights Templar}}
[[File:Chapelletemplier.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Templar chapel from the 12th century in [[Metz]], France. Once part of the Templar commandery of [[Metz]], the oldest Templar institution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]
The Templars were organised as a [[monasticism|monastic order]] similar to Bernard's [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] Order, which was considered the first effective international organization in Europe.<ref>[[#Burman|Burman]], p. 28.</ref> The organizational structure had a strong chain of authority. Each country with a major Templar presence (France, [[Knights Templar in England|England]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Poitou]], [[Apulia]], Jerusalem, [[Tripoli]], [[Antioch]], [[Anjou]], Hungary, and Croatia)<ref>Barber, ''Trial'', 1978, p. 10.</ref> had a Master of the Order for the Templars in that region.

All of them were subject to the [[Grand Masters of the Knights Templar|Grand Master]], appointed for life, who oversaw both the Order's military efforts in the East and their financial holdings in the West. The Grand Master exercised his authority via the visitors-general of the order, who were knights specially appointed by the Grand Master and convent of Jerusalem to visit the different provinces, correct malpractices, introduce new regulations, and resolve important disputes. The visitors-general had the power to remove knights from office and to suspend the Master of the province concerned.

No precise numbers exist, but it is estimated that at the Order's peak there were between 15,000 and 20,000 Templars, of whom about a tenth were actual knights.<ref name=burman-45/><ref name=quantity/>

===Ranks within the order===

====Three main ranks====
There was a threefold division of the ranks of the Templars: the noble knights, the non-noble sergeants, and the chaplains. The Templars did not perform knighting ceremonies, so any knight wishing to become a Knight Templar had to be a knight already.<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=The Knights Templar 1: The Knights|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/the-knights-templar-1-the-knights/|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref>   They were the most visible branch of the order, and wore the famous white mantles to symbolize their purity and chastity.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rule of the Templars|page=article 17}}</ref> They were equipped as heavy [[cavalry]], with three or four horses and one or two squires. Squires were generally not members of the Order but were instead outsiders who were hired for a set period of time. Beneath the knights in the Order and drawn from non-noble families were the sergeants.<ref>Barber, ''New Knighthood'', p. 190.</ref> They brought vital skills and trades such as blacksmithing and building, and administered many of the Order's European properties.  In the Crusader States, they fought alongside the knights as [[light cavalry]] with a single horse.<ref>Martin, p. 54.</ref> Several of the Order's most senior positions were reserved for sergeants, including the post of Commander of the Vault of Acre, who was the ''de facto'' Admiral of the Templar fleet.  The sergeants wore black or brown.  From 1139, [[chaplain]]s constituted a third Templar class.  They were [[ordination|ordained]] priests who cared for the Templar's' spiritual needs.<ref>{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=The Knights Templars}}</ref> All three classes of brother wore the Order's red cross patty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=The Knights Templars 2: Sergeants, Women, Chaplains, Affiliates|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/the-knights-templars-2-sergeants-chaplains-women-affiliates/|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref>

====Grand Masters====
{{Main|Grand Masters of the Knights Templar}}
[[File:Saint-Martin-des-Champs Chapelle.JPG|right|thumb|Templar building at Saint Martin des Champs, France]]
Starting with founder [[Hugues de Payens]] in 1118<U+2013>1119, the Order's highest office was that of Grand Master, a position which was held for life, though considering the martial nature of the Order, this could mean a very short tenure. All but two of the Grand Masters died in office, and several died during military campaigns. For example, during the [[Siege of Ascalon]] in 1153, Grand Master [[Bernard de Tremelay]] led a group of 40 Templars through a breach in the city walls. When the rest of the Crusader army did not follow, the Templars, including their Grand Master, were surrounded and beheaded.<ref>Read, p. 137.</ref> Grand Master [[G<U+00E9>rard de Ridefort]] was beheaded by Saladin in 1189 at the [[Siege of Acre (1189)|Siege of Acre]].

The Grand Master oversaw all of the operations of the Order, including both the [[military campaign|military operations]] in the Holy Land and [[Eastern Europe]] and the Templars' financial and business dealings in [[Western Europe]]. Some Grand Masters also served as battlefield commanders, though this was not always wise: several blunders in de Ridefort's combat leadership contributed to the devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Hattin]]. The last Grand Master was [[Jacques de Molay]], burned at the stake in Paris in 1314 by order of King Philip IV.<ref name=Barber-Trial3/>

===Behaviour and Clothing===
[[File:HPIM3597.JPG|thumb|Representation of a Knight Templar]]
It was Bernard de Clairvaux and founder Hugues de Payens who devised the specific code of behaviour for the Templar Order, known to modern historians as the [[Latin Rule]]. Its 72 clauses defined the ideal behaviour for the Knights, such as the types of garments they were to wear and how many horses they could have. Knights were to take their meals in silence, eat meat no more than three times per week, and not have physical contact of any kind with women, even members of their own family. A Master of the Order was assigned "4 horses, and one chaplain-brother and one clerk with three horses, and one sergeant brother with two horses, and one gentleman valet to carry his shield and lance, with one horse."<ref>[[#Burman|Burman]], p. 43.</ref> As the Order grew, more guidelines were added, and the original list of 72 clauses was expanded to several hundred in its final form.<ref>[[#Burman|Burman]], pp. 30<U+2013>33.</ref><ref>Martin, p. 32.</ref>

The knights wore a white [[surcoat]] with a red cross and a white mantle also with a red cross; the sergeants wore a black tunic with a red cross on the front and a black or brown mantle.<ref>Barber, ''New Knighthood'', p. 191.</ref><ref name=burman-44>[[#Burman|Burman]], p. 44.</ref> The white mantle was assigned to the Templars at the [[Council of Troyes]] in 1129, and the cross was most probably added to their [[Religious habit|robes]] at the launch of the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, when [[Pope Eugene III|Pope Eugenius III]], King [[Louis VII of France]], and many other notables attended a meeting of the French Templars at their headquarters near Paris.<ref>Barber, ''The New Knighthood'', page 66: "According to [[William of Tyre]] it was under Eugenius III that the Templars received the right to wear the characteristic red cross upon their tunics, symbolising their willingness to suffer [[martyr]]dom in the defence of the Holy Land." (WT, 12.7, p. 554. James of Vitry, 'Historia Hierosolimatana', ed. J. ars, [[Dei gesta per Francos|Gesta Dei per Francos]], vol I(ii), Hanover, 1611, p. 1083, interprets this as a sign of martyrdom.)</ref><ref>Martin, ''The Knights Templar'', page 43: "The Pope conferred on the Templars the right to wear a red cross on their white mantles, which symbolised their willingness to suffer martyrdom in defending the Holy Land against the infidel."</ref><ref>Read, ''The Templars'', page 121: "Pope Eugenius gave them the right to wear a scarlet cross over their hearts, so that the sign would serve triumphantly as a shield and they would never turn away in the face of the infidels': the red blood of the martyr was superimposed on the white of the chaste." (Melville, ''La Vie des Templiers'', p. 92.)</ref> According to their Rule, the knights were to wear the white mantle at all times, even being forbidden to eat or drink unless they were wearing it.<ref>[[#Burman|Burman]], p. 46.</ref>

[[File:Templar Flag 6.svg|left|upright|thumb|One of the many reported flags of the Knights Templar]]

The red cross that the Templars wore on their robes was a symbol of [[martyr]]dom, and to die in combat was considered a great honor that assured a place in heaven.<ref>[[#Nicholson2001|Nicholson]], p. 141.</ref> There was a cardinal rule that the warriors of the Order should never surrender unless the Templar flag had fallen, and even then they were first to try to regroup with another of the Christian orders, such as that of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]]. Only after all flags had fallen were they allowed to leave the battlefield.<ref>Barber, ''New Knighthood'', p. 193.</ref> This uncompromising principle, along with their reputation for courage, excellent training, and heavy armament, made the Templars one of the most feared combat forces in medieval times.<ref name=TR>{{cite book|author=Picknett, Lynn and Prince, Clive|title=The Templar Revelation|year=1997|isbn=0-684-84891-0|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, N.Y.}}</ref>

Although not prescribed by the Templar Rule, it later became customary for members of the order to wear long and prominent beards. In about 1240, [[Alberic of Trois-Fontaines]] described the Templars as an "order of bearded brethren"; while during the interrogations by the papal commissioners in Paris in 1310<U+2013>11, out of nearly 230 knights and brothers questioned, 76 are described as wearing a beard, in some cases specified as being "in the style of the Templars", and 133 are said to have shaved off their beards, either in renunciation of the order or because they had hoped to escape detection.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124<U+2013>32 (124<U+2013>5) }}</ref><ref>Nicholson 2001, pp. 48, 124<U+2013>7.</ref>

Initiation,<ref>Martin, p. 52.</ref> known as Reception (''receptio'') into the Order, was a profound commitment and involved a solemn ceremony. Outsiders were discouraged from attending the ceremony, which aroused the suspicions of [[Medieval Inquisition|medieval inquisitors]] during the later [[Knights Templar Trial|trials]]. New members had to willingly sign over all of their wealth and goods to the Order and take [[religious vows|vows of poverty, chastity, piety, and obedience]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Real History Behind the Templars|publisher=Berkeley Publishing|year=2007|pages=304<U+2013>312|author=[[Sharan Newman|Newman, Sharan]]}}</ref> Most brothers joined for life, although some were allowed to join for a set period. Sometimes a married man was allowed to join if he had his wife's permission,<ref name=burman-44/> but he was not allowed to wear the white mantle.<ref>Barber, ''Trial'', 1978, p. 4.</ref>

==Legacy==
{{See also|List of places associated with the Knights Templar}}
[[File:TempleChurch-Exterior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Temple Church]], London. As the chapel of the New Temple in London, it was the location for Templar initiation ceremonies. In modern times it is the parish church of the [[Middle Temple|Middle]] and [[Inner Temple]]s, two of the [[Inns of Court]], and a popular tourist attraction.]]

With their military mission and extensive financial resources, the Knights Templar funded a large number of building projects around Europe and the Holy Land. Many of these structures are still standing.  Many sites also maintain the name "Temple" because of centuries-old association with the Templars.<ref>Martin, p. 58.</ref> For example, some of the Templars' lands in London were later rented to [[lawyer]]s, which led to the names of the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] gateway and the [[Temple tube station|Temple Underground station]]. Two of the four [[Inns of Court]] which may call members to act as [[barrister]]s are the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]].

Distinctive [[architecture|architectural]] elements of Templar buildings include the use of the image of "two knights on a single horse", representing the Knights' poverty, and round buildings designed to resemble the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem.<ref>Barber, ''New Knighthood'' (1994), pp. 194<U+2013>195</ref>

===Modern organizations===
{{Main|Knights Templar and popular culture}}
The story of the persecution and sudden dissolution of the secretive yet powerful medieval Templars has drawn many other groups to use alleged connections with the Templars as a way of enhancing their own image and mystery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7050713.stm|title=What are the Knights Templar up to now?|date=October 19, 2007|author=Finlo Rohrer|work=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> There is no clear historical connection between the Knights Templar, which were dismantled in the Rolls of the Catholic Church in 1309 with the martyrdom of Jacques de Molay, and any of the modern organizations, of which, except for the Scottish Order, the earliest emerged publicly in the 18th century.<ref>''The Mythology Of The Secret Societies'' (London: Secker and Warburg, 1972). ISBN 0-436-42030-9</ref><ref>Peter Partner, ''The Murdered Magicians: The Templars And Their Myth'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982). ISBN 0-19-215847-3</ref><ref>John Walliss, ''Apocalyptic Trajectories: Millenarianism and Violence In The Contemporary World'', page 130 (Bern: Peter Lang AG, European Academic Publishers, 2004). ISBN 3-03910-290-7</ref><ref>Michael Haag, ''Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's Temple To The Freemasons'' (Profile Books Ltd, 2009). ISBN 978-1-84668-153-0</ref> There is often public confusion and many overlook the 400-year gap. However, in 1853, Napoleon III officially recognized the [[Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani|OSMTH]]. The Order operates on the basis of the traditions of the medieval Knights Templar, celebrating the spirit of, but not claiming direct descent from the ancient Order founded by Hugues de Payens in 1118 and dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312.

====Freemasonry====
{{main|Knights Templar (Freemasonry)}}
Since at least the 18th century, [[Freemasonry]] has incorporated Templar symbols and rituals in a number of [[Masonic bodies]],<ref name=HC/> most notably, the "[[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)#The Degree of Knight of the Temple (Order of the Temple)|Order of the Temple]]" the final order joined in "The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta" commonly known as the Knights Templar. One theory of the origins of Freemasonry claims direct descent from the historical Knights Templar through its final fourteenth-century members who took refuge in [[Scotland]] whose King, [[Robert the Bruce]] was excommunicated by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] at the time, or in Portugal where the order changed its name to ''[[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Knights of Christ]]'', other members having joined Knights of St. John. There have even been claims that some of the Templars who made it to Scotland contributed to the Scots' victory at [[Bannockburn]]. This theory is usually deprecated on grounds of lack of evidence, by both Masonic authorities<ref>[http://www.knightstemplar.org/faq1.html#origin Knights Templar FAQ], accessed January 10, 2007.</ref> and historians.<ref name="fmt">{{cite web|accessdate=2011-05-28|url=http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/19/p07.php|title=Freemasonry Today periodical (Issue January 2002) |publisher=Grand Lodge Publications Ltd }} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The Roman Catholic Church has historically opposed Freemasonry since it began to emerge, under the belief that the group is a "Secret Society" and has a deeply hidden agenda that opposes the church and its beliefs. Members of the Church found to be Freemasons were, in the early 20th century, commonly excommunicated. This has often led to the misguided belief that the Church somehow also opposed the Knights Templar, however the Church makes distinction between the Templars, a public monastic order, and "Secret Societies". Excommunication as an action taken against Catholics who were found to be Freemasons was lifted by Pope John Paul II in the 1980s however, in the same Papal Bull, he reiterated his predecessors strong opposition to Freemasonry, stating that any person who is involved in a secret society and takes communion is putting their soul in grave danger.

===Legends and relics===
{{Main|Knights Templar legends}}

The Knights Templar have become associated with [[legend]]s concerning [[esotericism|secrets and mysteries]] handed down to the select from ancient times. Rumors circulated even during the time of the Templars themselves. Freemasonic writers added their own speculations in the 19th century, and further fictional embellishments have been added in popular novels such as ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'', ''[[The Lost symbol]]'', and ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'';<ref name=HC/> modern movies such as ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''; and video games such as ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', ''[[The Secret World]]'' and ''[[Broken Sword]]''.<ref>{{cite web |first=Magy Seif |last=El-Nasr  |coauthors=Maha Al-Saati; Simon Niedenthal; David Milam |title=Assassin's Creed: A Multi-Cultural Read |pages=6<U+2013>7 |quote=we interviewed Jade Raymond ... Jade says ... Templar Treasure was ripe for exploring. What did the Templars find |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/viewPDFInterstitial/51/46 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>

Many of the Templar legends are connected with the Order's early occupation of the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem and speculation about what [[relic]]s the Templars may have found there, such as the [[Holy Grail]] or the [[Ark of the Covenant]].<ref name=HC/><ref name=Martin>Sean Martin, ''The Knights Templar: The History & Myths of the Legendary Military Order'', 2005. ISBN 1-56025-645-1.</ref><ref name=TR/><ref>Louis Charpentier, ''Les Myst<U+00E8>res de la Cath<U+00E9>drale de Chartres'' (Paris: Robert Laffont, 1966), translated ''The Mysteries of Chartres Cathedral'' (London: Research Into Lost Knowledge Organisation, 1972).</ref> That the Templars were in possession of some relics is certain. Many churches still display holy relics such as the bones of a saint, a scrap of cloth once worn by a holy man, or the skull of a martyr; the Templars did the same. They were documented as having a piece of the [[True Cross]], which the Bishop of Acre carried into battle at the disastrous [[Horns of Hattin]].<ref>Read, p. 91.</ref> When the battle was lost, Saladin captured the relic, which was then ransomed back to the Crusaders when the Muslims surrendered the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in 1191.<ref>Read, p. 171.</ref> The Templars were also rumored to possess the head of [[Saint Euphemia of Chalcedon]],<ref>Martin, p. 139.</ref> and the subject of relics came up during the Inquisition of the Templars, as several trial documents refer to the supposed worship of an idol of some type, referred to in some cases as a cat, a bearded head, or in some cases as [[Baphomet]]. This accusation of idol worship levied against the Templars has also led to the modern mistaken belief by some that the Templars practiced witchcraft.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sanello, Frank|title=The Knights Templars: God's Warriors, the Devil's Bankers|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|year=2003|isbn=0-87833-302-9|pages=207<U+2013>208}}</ref> However, modern scholars generally explain the name Baphomet from the trial documents as simply a French misspelling of the name Mahomet ([[Muhammad]]).<ref name=HC/><ref>Barber, ''Trial of the Templars'', 1978, p. 62.</ref>

The Holy Grail quickly became associated with the Templars, even in the 12th century. The first Grail romance, ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Le Conte du Graal]]'', was written around 1180 by [[Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes]], who came from the same area where the [[Council of Troyes]] had officially sanctioned the Templars' Order. Perhaps twenty years later ''[[Parzival]]'', [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s version of the tale, refers to knights called "Templeisen" guarding the Grail Kingdom.<ref>Martin, p. 133.</ref> Another hero of the Grail quest, Sir [[Galahad]] (a 13th-century literary invention of monks from St. Bernard's Cistercian Order) was depicted bearing a shield with the cross of [[Saint George]], similar to the Templars' insignia: this version presented the Holy Grail as a Christian relic. A legend developed that since the Templars had their headquarters at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, they must have excavated in search of relics, found the Grail, and then proceeded to keep it in secret and guard it with their lives. However, in the extensive documents of the Templar inquisition there was never a single mention of anything like a Grail relic,<ref name=Worlds/> let alone its possession by the Templars, nor is there any evidence that a Templar wrote a Grail Romance.<ref>Karen Ralls, ''Knights Templar Encyclopedia: The Essential Guide to the People, Places, Events and Symbols of the Order of the Temple'', page 156 (The Career Press, Inc., 2007). ISBN 978-1-56414-926-8</ref> In reality, most mainstream scholars agree that the story of the Grail was just that, a literary fiction that began circulating in medieval times.<ref name=HC/><ref name=Martin/>

Another legendary object that is claimed to have some connection with the Templars is the [[Shroud of Turin]]. In 1357, the shroud was first publicly displayed by the widow of a nobleman known as Geoffrey of Charney,<ref>Barber, ''The New Knighthood'', p. 332</ref> described by some sources as being a member of the family of the grandson of [[Geoffroi de Charney]], who was burned at the stake with De Molay.<ref>Newman, p. 383</ref> The shroud's origins are still a matter of controversy, but in 1988, a [[radiocarbon dating|carbon dating]] analysis concluded that the shroud was made between 1260 and 1390, a span that includes the last half-century of the Templars' existence.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.uthscsa.edu/mission/spring96/shroud.htm|title=Science and the Shroud: Microbiology meets archeology in a renewed quest for answers|journal=The Mission|date= Spring 1996|accessdate=February 13, 2009|author=Barrett, Jim}}</ref> The validity of the dating methodology has subsequently been called into question, and the age of the shroud is still the subject of much debate<ref>Relic, Harry Gove (1996) Icon or Hoax?
