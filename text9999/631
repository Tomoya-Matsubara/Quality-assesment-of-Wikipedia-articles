'''Polysaccharides''' are [[polymeric]] [[carbohydrate]] molecules composed of long chains of [[monosaccharide]] units bound together by [[glycosidic bond|glycosidic linkages]] and on [[hydrolysis]] give the constituent [[monosaccharides]] or [[oligosaccharides]]. They range in structure from linear to highly branched. Examples include storage polysaccharides such as [[starch]] and [[glycogen]], and structural polysaccharides such as [[cellulose]] and [[chitin]].

Polysaccharides are often quite heterogeneous, containing slight modifications of the repeating unit. Depending on the structure, these [[macromolecule]]s can have distinct properties from their monosaccharide building blocks. They may be [[amorphous]] or even [[insoluble]] in water.<ref name=Varki_2008>{{cite book | author=Varki A, Cummings R, Esko J, Freeze H, Stanley P, Bertozzi C, Hart G, Etzler M | title=Essentials of glycobiology | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2nd edition | year=2008 | isbn=0-87969-770-9 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=glyco2 | work=Essentials of Glycobiology}}</ref><ref name=Varki_1999>{{cite book | author=Varki A, Cummings R, Esko J, Jessica Freeze, Hart G, Marth J | title=Essentials of glycobiology | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-87969-560-9 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=glyco.TOC&depth=2 | work=Essentials of glycobiology}}</ref> When all the monosaccharides in a polysaccharide are the same type, the polysaccharide is called a ''homopolysaccharide'' or ''homoglycan'', but when more than one type of monosaccharide is present they are called ''heteropolysaccharides'' or ''heteroglycans''.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=homopolysaccharide (homoglycan)|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02856.html}}</ref><ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=heteropolysaccharide (heteroglycan)|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02812.html}}</ref> 

Natural saccharides are generally of simple carbohydrates called [[monosaccharide]]s with general formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''n''</sub> where ''n'' is three or more. Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[glyceraldehyde]]<ref>
  Matthews, C. E.; K. E. Van Holde; K. G. Ahern (1999) ''Biochemistry''. 3rd edition. Benjamin Cummings. ISBN 0-8053-3066-6
</ref> Polysaccharides, meanwhile, have a general formula of C<sub>x</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>y</sub> where x is usually a large number between 200 and 2500. Considering that the repeating units in the polymer backbone are often six-carbon monosaccharides, the general formula can also be represented as (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub>n</sub> where 40<U+2264>n<U+2264>3000.

Polysaccharides contain more than ten monosaccharide units. Definitions of how large a carbohydrate must be to fall into the categories polysaccharides or [[oligosaccharide]]s vary according to personal opinion. Polysaccharides are an important class of [[biopolymer|biological polymers]]. Their [[function (biology)|function]] in living organisms is usually either structure- or storage-related. [[Starch]] (a polymer of glucose) is used as a storage polysaccharide in plants, being found in the form of both [[amylose]] and the branched [[amylopectin]]. In animals, the structurally similar glucose polymer is the more densely branched [[glycogen]], sometimes called 'animal starch'. Glycogen's properties allow it to be metabolized more quickly, which suits the active lives of moving animals.

[[Cellulose]] and [[chitin]] are examples of structural polysaccharides. Cellulose is used in the [[cell wall]]s of plants and other organisms, and is said to be the most abundant [[organic molecule]] on earth.<ref>N.A.Campbell (1996) ''Biology'' (4th edition). Benjamin Cummings NY. p.23 ISBN 0-8053-1957-3</ref> It has many uses such as a significant role in the paper and textile industries, and is used as a feedstock for the production of rayon (via the [[viscose]] process), cellulose acetate, celluloid, and nitrocellulose. Chitin has a similar structure, but has [[nitrogen]]-containing side branches, increasing its strength. It is found in [[arthropod]] [[exoskeleton]]s and in the cell walls of some [[fungi]]. It also has multiple uses, including [[surgical thread]]s. Polysaccharides also include [[callose]] or [[laminarin]], [[chrysolaminarin]], [[xylan]], [[arabinoxylan]], [[mannan]], [[fucoidan]] and [[galactomannan]].

==Function==

===Structure===
Nutrition polysaccharides are common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose; however, most organisms cannot metabolize cellulose or other polysaccharides like [[chitin]] and [[arabinoxylans]]. These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. [[Ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, for example, use microorganisms to process [[cellulose]]. 

Even though these complex to  carbohydrates are not very digestible, they provide important dietary elements for humans. Called [[dietary fiber]], these carbohydrates enhance digestion among other benefits. The main action of dietary fiber is to change the nature of the contents of the [[gastrointestinal tract]], and to change how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed.<ref name=USDA-IOM>{{cite web | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients) (2005), Chapter 7: Dietary, Functional and Total fiber.| publisher = US Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Library and National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board| url = http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Energy/339-421.pdf}}</ref><ref name=Eastwood/> Soluble fiber binds to [[bile acids]] in the small intestine, making them less likely to enter the body; this in turn lowers [[cholesterol]] levels in the blood.<ref name=Anderson>{{cite journal |author=Anderson JW |title=Health benefits of dietary fiber |journal=Nutr Rev |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=188<U+2013>205 |year=2009 |pmid=19335713 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00189.x|author-separator=, |author2= Baird P |author3= Davis RH |author4=and others |displayauthors=3 }}</ref> Soluble fiber also attenuates the absorption of sugar, reduces sugar response after eating, normalizes blood lipid levels and, once fermented in the colon, produces [[short-chain fatty acid]]s as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities (discussion below).

==Storage polysaccharides==

=== Starches ===
[[Starches]] are [[glucose]] polymers in which [[glucopyranose]] units are bonded by ''alpha-''linkages. It is made up of a mixture of [[amylose]] (15<U+2013>20%) and [[amylopectin]] (80<U+2013>85%). Amylose consists of a linear chain of several hundred glucose molecules and Amylopectin is a branched molecule made of several thousand glucose units (every chain of 24<U+2013>30 glucose units is one unit of Amylopectin). Starches are [[insoluble]] in [[water]]. They can be digested which can break the ''alpha-''linkages (glycosidic bonds). Both humans and animals have amylases, so they can digest starches. [[Potato]], [[rice]], [[wheat]], and [[maize]] are major sources of starch in the human diet. The formations of starches are the ways that plants store [[glucose]].

===Glycogen===
Glycogen serves as the secondary long-term energy storage in [[animal]] and [[fungi|fungal]] cells, with the primary energy stores being held in [[adipose tissue]]. Glycogen is made primarily by the [[liver]] and the [[muscle]]s, but can also be made by [[glycogenesis]] within the [[brain]] and [[stomach]].<ref>Anatomy and Physiology. Saladin, Kenneth S. McGraw-Hill, 2007.</ref> 

Glycogen is the analogue of [[starch]], a glucose polymer in [[plant]]s, and is sometimes referred to as ''animal starch'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/animal%20starch | title=Animal starch | publisher=Merriam Webster | accessdate=May 11, 2014}}</ref> having a similar structure to [[amylopectin]] but more extensively branched and compact than starch. Glycogen is a polymer of <U+03B1>(1<U+2192>4) glycosidic bonds linked, with <U+03B1>(1<U+2192>6)-linked branches. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the [[cytosol]]/cytoplasm in many [[cell (biology)|cell]] types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose cycle]]. Glycogen forms an [[energy]] reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact and more immediately available as an energy reserve than  [[triglycerides]] (lipids). 

In the liver [[hepatocyte]]s, glycogen can compose up to eight percent (100<U+2013>120&nbsp;g in an adult) of the fresh weight soon after a meal.<ref name="Campbell 2006">{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Neil A. | authorlink = | coauthors = Brad Williamson; Robin J.

Small amounts of glycogen are found in the [[kidney]]s, and even smaller amounts in certain [[glial]] cells in the [[brain]] and [[white blood cells]]. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy, to nourish the embryo.<ref name="Campbell 2006"/>

Glycogen is composed of a branched chain of glucose residues. It is stored in liver and muscles.
*It is an energy reserve for animals.
*It is the chief form of carbohydrate stored in animal body.
*It is insoluble in water. It turns red when mixed with iodine.
*It also yields glucose on [[hydrolysis]].

==Structural polysaccharides==

=== Arabinoxylans ===
[[Arabinoxylan]]s are found in both the primary and secondary cell walls of plants and are the copolymers of two [[pentose]] sugars: [[arabinose]] and [[xylose]].

=== Cellulose ===
The structural component of [[plant]]s are formed primarily from [[cellulose]]. Wood is largely cellulose and [[lignin]], while [[paper]] and [[cotton]] are nearly pure cellulose. Cellulose is a [[polymer]] made with repeated glucose units bonded together by ''beta-''linkages.  Humans and many animals lack an enzyme to break the ''beta-''linkages, so they do not digest cellulose.  Certain animals such as [[termite]]s can digest cellulose, because bacteria possessing the enzyme are present in their gut. Cellulose is insoluble in water. It does not change color when mixed with iodine. On hydrolysis, it yields glucose. It is the most abundant carbohydrate in nature.

=== Chitin ===
[[Chitin]] is one of many naturally occurring [[polymers]]. It forms a structural component of many animals, such as [[exoskeleton]]s. Over time it is bio-degradable in the natural environment. Its breakdown may be catalyzed by [[enzyme]]s called [[chitinase]]s, secreted by microorganisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], and produced by some plants. Some of these microorganisms have [[Chemoreceptors|receptors]] to simple [[sugars]] from the decomposition of chitin. If chitin is detected, they then produce [[enzyme]]s to digest it by cleaving the [[glycosidic bond]]s in order to convert it to simple sugars and [[ammonia]].

Chemically, chitin is closely related to [[chitosan]] (a more water-soluble derivative of chitin). It is also closely related to [[cellulose]] in that it is a long unbranched chain of [[glucose]] derivatives. Both materials contribute structure and strength, protecting the organism.

=== Pectins ===
[[Pectin]]s are a family of complex polysaccharides that contain 1,4-linked <U+03B1>-D-galactosyluronic acid residues.  They are present in most primary cell walls and in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants.

== Acidic polysaccharides ==
Acidic polysaccharides are polysaccharides that contain [[carboxyl group]]s, phosphate groups and/or [[sulfur]]ic [[ester]] groups.

==Bacterial capsular polysaccharides==
[[Pathogenic bacteria]] commonly produce a thick, mucous-like, layer of polysaccharide. This "capsule" cloaks [[antigen]]ic [[protein]]s on the bacterial surface that would otherwise provoke an immune response and thereby lead to the destruction of the bacteria.  Capsular polysaccharides are water soluble, commonly acidic, and have [[molecular weight]]s on the order of 100-2000 [[atomic mass unit|kDa]].  They are linear and consist of regularly repeating subunits of one to six [[monosaccharide]]s.  There is enormous structural diversity; nearly two hundred different polysaccharides are produced by [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] alone.  Mixtures of capsular polysaccharides, either [[conjugate vaccine|conjugated]] or native are used as [[vaccine]]s.

Bacteria and many other microbes, including [[fungi]] and [[algae]], often secrete polysaccharides to help them adhere to surfaces and to prevent them from drying out.  Humans have developed some of these polysaccharides into useful products, including [[xanthan gum]], [[dextran]], welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and [[pullulan]]. 

Most of these polysaccharides exhibit useful [[visco-elastic]] properties when dissolved in water at very low levels.<ref>Viscosity of Welan Gum vs. Concentration in Water. http://www.xydatasource.com/xy-showdatasetpage.php?datasetcode=345115&dsid=80</ref> This makes various liquids used in everyday life, such as some foods, lotions, cleaners, and paints, viscous when stationary, but much more free-flowing when even slight shear is applied by stirring or shaking, pouring, wiping, or brushing. This property is named pseudoplasticity or [[shear thinning]]; the study of such matters is called [[rheology]].

Aqueous solutions of the polysaccharide alone have a curious behavior when stirred: after stirring ceases, the solution initially continues to swirl due to momentum, then slows to a standstill due to viscosity and reverses direction briefly before stopping. This recoil is due to the elastic effect of the polysaccharide chains, previously stretched in solution, returning to their relaxed state.

Cell-surface polysaccharides play diverse roles in bacterial [[ecology]] and [[physiology]]. They serve as a barrier between the [[cell wall]] and the environment, mediate host-pathogen interactions, and form structural components of [[biofilm]]s. These polysaccharides are synthesized from [[nucleotide]]-activated precursors (called [[nucleotide sugar]]s) and, in most cases, all the enzymes necessary for biosynthesis, assembly and transport of the completed polymer are encoded by genes organized in dedicated clusters within the genome of the [[organism]]. [[Lipopolysaccharide]] is one of the most important cell-surface polysaccharides, as it plays a key structural role in outer membrane integrity, as well as being an important mediator of host-pathogen interactions. 

The enzymes that make the ''A-band'' (homopolymeric) and ''B-band'' (heteropolymeric) O-antigens have been identified and the [[metabolic pathway]]s defined.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guo H, Yi W, Song JK, Wang PG |title=Current understanding on biosynthesis of microbial polysaccharides |journal=Curr Top Med Chem |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=141<U+2013>51 |year=2008 |pmid=18289083 |doi=10.2174/156802608783378873}}</ref> The exopolysaccharide alginate is a linear copolymer of <U+03B2>-1,4-linked D-mannuronic acid and L-guluronic acid residues, and is responsible for the mucoid phenotype of late-stage cystic fibrosis disease. The ''pel'' and ''psl'' loci are two recently discovered gene clusters that also encode [[exopolysaccharide]]s found to be important for biofilm formation. [[Rhamnolipid]] is a biosurfactant whose production is tightly regulated at the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al level, but the precise role that it plays in disease is not well understood at present. Protein [[glycosylation]], particularly of [[pilin]] and [[flagellin]], became a focus of research by several groups from about 2007, and has been shown to be important for adhesion and invasion during bacterial infection.<ref name=Cornelis>{{cite book | author = Cornelis P (editor). | title = Pseudomonas: Genomics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/pseudo | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/pseudo  ] | isbn = 978-1-904455-19-6}}</ref>

==Chemical identification tests for polysaccharides==

===Periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
Polysaccharides with unprotected [[Diol#Vicinal_diols|vicinal diols]] or amino sugars (i.e. some OH groups replaced with amine) give a positive [[Periodic acid-Schiff stain]] (PAS). The list of polysaccharides that stain with PAS is long. Although [[mucin]]s of epithelial origins stain with PAS, mucins of connective tissue origin have so many acidic substitutions that they do not have enough glycol or amino-alcohol groups left to react with PAS.
