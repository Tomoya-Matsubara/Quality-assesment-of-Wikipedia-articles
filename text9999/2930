The '''Dickin Medal''' was instituted in 1943 in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Maria Dickin]] to honour the work of animals in war. It is a bronze [[medallion]], bearing the words "For Gallantry" and "We Also Serve" within a [[laurel wreath]], carried on ribbon of striped green, dark brown and pale blue.<ref name="pdsa"/> It is awarded to animals that have displayed "conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units".<ref name=pdsa/> The award is commonly referred to as "the animals' [[Victoria Cross]]".<ref name="pdsa">{{Cite web | url = http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/pdsa-dickin-medal|title = PDSA Dickin Medal|publisher = PDSA|accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=modtreo/><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/animals_vc.shtml |publisher = BBC Radio 4 | title = The Animals' VC | accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref>

Maria Dickin was the founder of the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] (PDSA), a British [[veterinary]] [[Charitable organization|charity]].  She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] armed forces or civil emergency services.  The medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949, to 32 pigeons, 18 dogs, 3 horses and a cat, to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the [[Second World War]]. 

The awarding of the medal was revived in early 2002, to honour three dogs for their role responding to the [[September 11 attacks]]; it was also awarded to two dogs serving with Commonwealth forces in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Iraq]]. In December 2007, 12 former recipients buried at the PDSA Animal Cemetery in [[Ilford]], [[Essex]], were afforded full military honours at the conclusion of a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]-aided project to restore the cemetery.<ref>{{Cite news| title =A better resting place for the animal VCs|author=Clout, Laura |work=Daily Telegraph| date=14 December 2007|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/media-pr-centre/news/celebrity-to-open-animal-garden-of-remembrance | title = Celebrity to open animal Garden of Remembrance | accessdate=2 March 2010|publisher = PDSA}}</ref>

The first recipients of the award, in December 1943, were three pigeons, serving with the [[Royal Air Force]], all of whom contributed to the recovery of air crew from ditched aircraft during the Second World War. The most recent animal to be honoured is [[Treo (dog)|Treo]], a black [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]], honoured for his "heroic actions as an arms and explosives search dog in Afghanistan".<ref name=modtreo>{{Cite web | url = http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/MilitarySearchDogToReceiveAnimalsVictoriaCross.htm| publisher = Ministry of Defence|date=8 February 2010|accessdate=3 March 2010|title = Military search dog to receive animals' Victoria Cross}}</ref> As of February 2011, the Dickin Medal has been awarded 63 times.<ref name="pdsa" />

*A <span id=endnote_A/>[[#ref_A|'''^''']] Rob was awarded the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 parachute drops and for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the [[Second World War]]. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at [[Special Air Service|2nd SAS]] at the time so that the dog would remain with the regiment.<ref name="Times">{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2277684.html |title = War heroics were a shaggy dog story| work=The Times |date=20 July 2006|accessdate=2 March 2010|first=Jack|last=Malvern | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7038561.ece | title = Dickin Medal awarded to Treo the bomb-sniffing military labrador|first=Jack|last=Malvern|work = The Times|accessdate=27 February 2010|date=24 February 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1524456/SAS-reports-of-canine-heroics-just-a-shaggy-dog-story.html | work = Daily Telegraph| accessdate=3 March 2010 | date = 21 July 2006|title = SAS reports of canine heroics 'just a shaggy dog story' | first = Richard|last=Alleyne | location=London}}</ref>
