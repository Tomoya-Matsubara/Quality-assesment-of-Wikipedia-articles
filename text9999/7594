The '''34th Street - Hudson Yards''' station is a planned [[terminal station]], under construction as part of the [[7 Subway Extension]] for the [[IRT Flushing Line]] of the [[New York City Subway]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://new.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/work-begin-under-last-major-contract-needed-extend-7-train| title=Work to Begin Under Last Major Contract Needed to Extend the 7| work=MTA.info| date=September 14, 2011| accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> It will have two tracks and one [[island platform]] with a large [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] overhead. The station was expected to open in December 2013, but in 2011, the opening was postponed to June 2014, pending the completion of the signals of the extension.<ref name="rts"/> The tracks of this station run past the station, down to 26th Street, to allow trains to be stored south of the station during peak hours. There is also a [[diamond crossover]] north of the station.

The new construction will extend the [[IRT Flushing Line]] west from Times Square to 11th Avenue then turn south to 34th Street. It was originally proposed as part of the failed attempt to build the [[West Side Stadium]] for the [[New York Jets]] and [[New York City 2012 Olympic bid|the city's bid]] for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. Although the stadium plan was rejected by city and state planning agencies, the 7 subway extension plan received approval to move ahead, as New York political leaders would like to see the warehouse district west of [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] and north of 34th Street [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project|redeveloped]], and subway service would be an essential part of that effort. The extension will also serve the newly expanded [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]].

Passenger access to the station includes an [[incline elevator]], the installation of which is causing a delay in opening the station to around September 2014. The station may have [[platform screen doors]] installed in the future; in September 2007, it was announced that the new station would feature platform screen doors, but as of December 2013, the station has been shown without platform screen doors.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MTA Plans To Install Platform Doors On 7 Line Extension |url=http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&aid=73389 |work=[[NY1]] |date=September 8, 2007 |accessdate=January 08, 2014}}</ref> The station will include special air-cooling systems, like those at the temporarily-closed [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway <U+2013> Seventh Avenue Line)|2009 South Ferry station]], to reduce the temperature along platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cooler Subways Coming <U+2013> Eventually |first=Pete |last=Donohue |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/cooler-subways-coming-eventually-article-1.550619 |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=August 4, 2006 |accessdate=January 08, 2014}}</ref>

Planned names for the station include ''34th Street'' and ''34th Street <U+2013> Hudson Yards''. {{As of|December 2013}}, however, the station name has not been finalized yet.<ref name="nydailynews">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bloomberg-sneak-ride-7-line-extension-article-1.1554643 |title=Mayor Bloomberg gets ride on No. 7 subway line extension he championed |publisher=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York |date=2013-10-21 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref>

The station is projected to serve 27,000 passengers per day, or about 9.855 million passengers per year, when open, which will make it one of the busiest subway stations in New York City that is not in a station complex.<ref name="capital program"/><ref name="nydailynews"/> The station is more than 10 stories deep, and is the first city-built subway extension since the [[Jamaica <U+2013> 179th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Jamaica <U+2013> 179th Street]] station on the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] opened in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kelly Weill |url=http://gothamist.com/2013/12/21/bloomberg_takes_the_new_7_subway_li.php#photo-1 |title=Photos: Inside The New 7 Train Extension |publisher=[[Gothamist]] |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}</ref> 34th Street station will also include two {{convert|80|ft|m|sing=on}} [[inclined elevator]]s, the first station in the subway system to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/nyregion/for-a-mayor-on-his-way-out-a-subway-station-on-its-way-in.html?_r=0|title=For a Mayor on His Way Out, a Subway Station on Its Way In |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |first=Matt |last= Flegenheimer |date= 2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref><ref name="capital program">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capital/no7_alt.html|date= 2013-12-20|title=Capital Program 7 Line Extension|publisher=MTA.info |accessdate=2014-1-30}}</ref> The station's opening was first delayed to June 2014 for completion of the station's fitting-out,<ref name="rts">{{cite web|url=http://www.rtands.com/index.php/passenger/rapid-transit-light-rail/nyct-gives-mayor-bloomberg-ceremonial-ride-on-7-subway-extension.html |title=NYCT gives Mayor Bloomberg ceremonial ride on 7 Subway Extension &#124; Railway Track & Structures |publisher=Rtands.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref> then to September 2014 to install the inclined elevator. Michael Horodniceanu, chief of MTA Construction Company, told the [[New York Times]] that complications in the installation of the inclined elevator would likely cause a further delay of about three months, bringing the opening date to very late summer or early fall of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=More Delays and Rising Cost for Project Connecting L.I.R.R. to Grand Central Terminal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/nyregion/more-delays-and-rising-cost-for-project-connecting-lirr-to-grand-central-terminal.html?ref=nyregion&_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>
