'''Khandas''' is a small village in [[India]] approximately 34 km from [[Karjat]] station.  It is the starting point for trek to [[Bhimashanker]].
It takes approx 5 hours to reach Bhimashanker from Khandas village via [[Ganesh Ghat]] which is an easier route.  The other route to Bhimashanker from Khandas is via [[Sidi Ghat]] which is a shorter route compared to Ganesh Ghat but quite tough.  Khandas village is in itself a very beautiful place especially during the [[monsoon]] season.
