A '''tattie scone''' or '''potato scone''' is a regional variant of the savoury [[griddle scone]] which is especially popular in [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. Many variations of the recipe exist. They generally include liberal quantities of [[boiled]] [[potato]]es, butter and [[salt]].

Potato scones are traditionally made as circles of about 90&nbsp;mm in radius and then cut into quarters. They may also be baked in small rounds.<ref>F. Marian McNiell; "The Scots Kitchen"; Birlinn; ISBN 978-1-84158-873-5; p.231</ref>  They are generally unleavened and are thinner, 7&nbsp;mm or so, than what is usually considered a scone; they resemble a soft [[oatcake]]. They are often served as part of the [[full Scottish breakfast]] with fried eggs, bacon and [[sliced sausage]]. Alternatively, they are often enjoyed in a [[Bread roll|roll]], usually accompanied with either sliced sausage, [[bacon]], or [[fried egg]].

A typical potato scone is made with [[mashed potato]] (potato and butter<U+2014>no milk is used<U+2014>with salt to taste) and plain flour is added to make it into a dough which is then rolled out and put on a [[griddle]] to cook.<ref>{{cite web

Potato scones contain a small proportion of flour to a large proportion of potatoes: one traditional recipe calls for two ounces of flour and half an ounce of butter to a pound of potatoes <ref>F.
