The '''Manchester Ship Canal''' is a {{convert|36|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} river navigation in the [[North West England|North West of England]]. Starting at the [[River Mersey|Mersey Estuary]] near Liverpool, it generally follows the original routes of the rivers Mersey and [[River Irwell|Irwell]] through the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] of [[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. Several sets of locks lift vessels about {{convert|60|ft|m}} up to Manchester where the canal's terminus was built.  Major landmarks along its route include the [[Barton Swing Aqueduct]], the first and only swing aqueduct in the world, and [[Trafford Park]], the world's first planned industrial estate and still the largest in Europe. 

The rivers Mersey and Irwell were first made navigable in the early 18th century.  Goods were also transported on the Runcorn extension of the [[Bridgewater Canal]] (from 1776) and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (from 1830).  By the late 19th century the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable, and Manchester's business community viewed Liverpool's dock and the railway companies' charges as excessive. A ship canal was proposed as a way of giving ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester.  The region was suffering from the effects of the [[Long Depression]], and for the canal's proponents, who argued that the scheme would boost competition and create jobs, the idea of a ship canal made sound economic sense. They initiated a public campaign to enlist support for the scheme, which was first presented to Parliament as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] in 1882. Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool, the canal's supporters were unable to gain the necessary [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885. 

Construction began in 1887; it took six years and cost about <U+00A3>15&nbsp;million.  When the ship canal opened in January 1894 it was the largest river navigation canal in the world. Although it enabled the newly created [[Port of Manchester]] to become Britain's third busiest port<U+2014>despite the city being about 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) inland<U+2014>the canal never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for. Ships often returned to sea loaded with ballast rather than goods for export, and gradually the balance of traffic moved to the west, resulting in the closure of the terminal docks at Salford.  Although able to accommodate a range of vessels from coastal ships to inter-continental [[cargo liner]]s, the canal is not large enough for all modern vessels. As of 2011, traffic had decreased from its peak in 1958 of 18&nbsp;million [[long ton]]s (20&nbsp;million [[short ton]]s) of freight each year to about 7&nbsp;million long tons (7.8&nbsp;million short tons). The canal is now privately owned by [[Peel Holdings|Peel Ports]], whose plans include redevelopment, expansion, and an increase in shipping from 8000 [[Intermodal container|containers]] a year to 100,000 by 2030, as part of their [[Atlantic Gateway (North West England)|Atlantic Gateway]] project.

==History==
===Early history===
The idea that the rivers Mersey and Irwell should be made navigable from the Mersey Estuary in the west to Manchester in the east was first proposed in 1660, and revived in 1712 by the English civil engineer [[Thomas Steers]].<ref name="Gray 1997 5">{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=5}}</ref> The necessary legislation was proposed in 1720, and the [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]]<ref>7 Geo. I c.15</ref> for the navigation passed into law in 1721.<ref>{{Harvnb|Albert|2007|p=200}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=10}}</ref>  Construction began in 1724, undertaken by the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation|Mersey & Irwell Navigation Company]].<ref name="Gray 1997 5"/>  By 1734 boats "of moderate size" were able to make the journey from quays near Water Street in Manchester to the [[Irish Sea]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref> but the navigation was only suitable for small ships; during periods of low rainfall or when strong easterly winds held back the tide in the estuary, there was not always sufficient depth of water for a fully laden boat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=7}}</ref>  The completion in 1776 of the Runcorn extension of the Bridgewater Canal, followed in 1830 by the opening of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], intensified competition for the carriage of goods. In 1825 an application had been made to Parliament for an Act to allow the construction of a ship canal between the mouth of the [[River Dee (United Kingdom)|River Dee]] and Manchester at a cost of <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million, but "the necessary forms not having been observed", it did not become law.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1836|p=279}}</ref> In 1844 ownership of the Mersey & Irwell Navigation was transferred to the Bridgewater Trustees, and in 1872 it was sold to The Bridgewater Navigation Company for <U+00A3>1.112&nbsp;million.<ref name="OwenP16" /> The navigation had by then fallen into disrepair, its owners preferring instead to maintain the more profitable canal;<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|Waterfall|White|Hendry|2010|p=277}}</ref> in 1882 the navigation was described as being "hopelessly choked with silt and filth",<ref name="OwenP16">{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=16}}</ref> and was closed to all but the smaller boats for 264 out of 311&nbsp;working days.<ref name="OwenP16"/>

[[File:Ship Canal Cartoon Punch.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Refer to caption|A cartoon published in the satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1882, ridiculing the idea that Manchester could become a major seaport]]
Along with deteriorating economic conditions in the 1870s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=41}}</ref> the start of a period known as the Great Depression, the dues charged by the [[Port of Liverpool]] and the railway charges from there to Manchester were perceived to be excessive by Manchester's business community; it was often cheaper to import goods from [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], on the opposite side of the country, than it was from Liverpool.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=27}}</ref> A [[ship canal]] was proposed as a way to reduce carriage charges, avoid payment of dock and town dues at Liverpool, and by-pass the [[Liverpool to Manchester Lines|Liverpool to Manchester railways]] by giving Manchester direct access to the sea for its imports and its exports of manufactured goods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willan|1977|p=173}}</ref> Historian Ian Harford suggested that the canal may also have been conceived as an "imaginative response to [the] problems of depression and unemployment"<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=168}}</ref> that Manchester was experiencing during the early 1880s.  Its proponents argued that reduced transport costs would make local industry more competitive, and that the scheme would help create new jobs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=11}}</ref>

The idea was championed by Manchester manufacturer [[Daniel Adamson]], who arranged a meeting at his home, [[the Towers (Manchester)|The Towers]] in [[Didsbury]], on 27&nbsp;June 1882. He invited the representatives of several [[Lancashire]] towns, local businessmen and politicians, and two civil engineers: [[Hamilton Fulton]] and [[Edward Leader Williams]]. Fulton's design was for a tidal canal, with no [[Canal locks|locks]] and a deepened channel into Manchester.  With the city about {{convert|60|ft}} above sea level, the docks and quays would have been well below the surrounding surface.  Williams' plan was to dredge a channel between a set of retaining walls, and build a series of [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and [[sluice]]s to lift incoming vessels up to Manchester.<ref>{{Harvnb|Winter|2002|pp=121<U+2013>122}}</ref>  Both engineers were invited to submit their proposals, and Williams' plans were selected to form the basis of a bill to be submitted to Parliament later that year.<ref name="OwenP31">{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=31}}</ref>{{-}}

===Public campaign===
To generate support for the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, who had worked for the [[Hull and Barnsley Railway]].  His task was to set up committees in every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions and sell the idea to the local public.  The first meeting was held on 4&nbsp;October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17&nbsp;October in the St. James Ward.  Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3&nbsp;November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees.  A large meeting of the working classes, attended by several local notables including the general secretaries of several trade unions, was held on 13&nbsp;November at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in Manchester.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|pp=21<U+2013>23}}</ref>

Regular night-time meetings were held across the region, headed by speakers from a range of professions.  Harford suggests that the organisers' choice of orators represents their "canny ability"<ref name="Harfordp24"/> to choose speakers who might move their audiences to support their cause.  By adopting techniques used by the [[Anti-Corn Law League]], their strategy was ultimately successful: local offices were acquired, secretaries hired and further meetings organised.  The weekly ''Ship Canal Gazette'', priced at one penny,<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=22}}</ref> was by the end of the year being sold at newsagents in towns across Lancashire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|pp=24<U+2013>26}}</ref>  The ''Gazette'' was part of a prolonged print campaign organised by the committee, to circulate leaflets and pamphlets, and write supportive letters to the local press, often signed with pseudonyms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=23}}</ref>  One of the few surviving leaflets, "The Manchester Ship Canal.  Reasons why it Should be Made", argued against dock and railway rates, which were apparently levied "with the object of protecting the interests of Railway kings, [so that] trade is handicapped, and wages kept low".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=26}}</ref>  By the end of 1882 the provisional committee comprised members from several of Manchester's large industries, but notably few of the city's wealthier inhabitants.  The sympathetic ''Manchester City News'' reported that "the rich men of South and East Lancashire, with a few notable exceptions, have not rivalled the enthusiasm of the general public".<ref name="Harfordp24">{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=24}}</ref>

===Bills===
[[File:BridgewaterCanalCheque.jpg|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption|Cheque dated 3&nbsp;August 1887, in the amount of <U+00A3>1,710,000, for the purchase of the Bridgewater Navigation Company. At the time it was the largest cheque ever presented.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=43}}</ref>]]
The Mersey Docks Board opposed the committee's first bill, presented late in 1882, and it was rejected by Parliament in January 1883 for breaching [[parliamentary procedure|Standing Orders]].  Within six weeks the committee organised hundreds of petitions from a range of bodies across the country; one representing Manchester was signed by almost 200,000&nbsp;people.  The requirement for Standing Orders was dispensed with, and the represented bill allowed to proceed.  Some witnesses against the scheme, worried that a canal would cause the entrance to the Mersey estuary to silt up, blocking traffic, cited the case of Chester harbour.  This had silted up due to a man-made cut through the [[Dee estuary]].  Faced with conflicting evidence, Parliament rejected the bill.<ref name="Winterp122">{{Harvnb|Winter|2002|p=122}}</ref>  Later mass meetings were held, including a large demonstration at Pomona Gardens on 24&nbsp;June 1884. Strong opposition from Liverpool led the House of Commons Committee to reject the committee's second bill on 1&nbsp;August 1884.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|pp=26<U+2013>27}}</ref>

The unresolved question of what would happen to the Mersey estuary if the canal was built had remained a sticking point.  During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was asked how he would avoid such a problem.  His reply, "I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until I reached Runcorn, and then I would strike inland",<ref>{{Harvnb|Forwood|1910|p=108}}</ref> prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion.<ref name="Winterp122"/>  Despite continued opposition, the committee's third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2&nbsp;May 1885, and received royal assent on 6&nbsp;August.<ref>{{Citation | title = Bringing the Sea to Manchester<U+2014>The Need for a 'Big Ditch' | url = http://www.canalarchive.org.uk/stories/storycontents.php?enum=te126 | publisher = canalarchive.org.uk | pages = 4<U+2013>5 | accessdate = 7&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref>  Certain conditions were attached; <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=37}}</ref> The estimated cost of construction was <U+00A3>5.16&nbsp;million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.<ref name="OwenP31"/>

===Financing===
The enabling Act of Parliament<!--give yr here--> stipulated that the ship canal company's <U+00A3>8&nbsp;million share capital had to be issued within two years, otherwise the act would lapse.<ref name="HarfordP14">{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=14}}</ref> Adamson wanted to encourage the widest possible share ownership, and believed the funds should be raised largely from the working population. [[Richard Peacock]], vice-chairman of the Provisional Manchester Ship Canal Committee, said in 1882:

{{quote|No few individuals should be expected to subscribe and form a company for mere gain; it should be taken on by the public; and if it is not&nbsp;... I for one should say drop the scheme&nbsp;... unless I see the public coming forward in a hearty manner.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harford|1994|p=132}}</ref>}}

The act forbade the company from issuing shares below <U+00A3>10 so, to make them easier for ordinary people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten so they could be paid for in instalments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=38<U+2013>39}}</ref>  The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million had been raised.  As a temporary solution, Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept <U+00A3>500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million of [[stock|ordinary share]]s and <U+00A3>4&nbsp;million of [[preference share]]s.<ref name="HarfordP14" /> Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, and resigned as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1&nbsp;February 1887. [[Barings Bank|Barings]] and [[N M Rothschild & Sons|Rothschild]] jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15&nbsp;July, and by 21&nbsp;July the issue had been fully [[underwriting|underwritten]], allowing construction to begin.<ref name="HarfordP14" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=42<U+2013>43}}</ref>  The [[Groundbreaking|first sod]] was cut on 11&nbsp;November 1887, by [[Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton|Lord Egerton of Tatton]], who had taken over the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from Adamson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Farnie|1980|p=4}}</ref>

The canal company exhausted its capital of <U+00A3>8&nbsp;million in 4&nbsp;years, when only half the construction work was completed.<ref name="Willan 1977 174">{{Harvnb|Willan|1977|p=174}}</ref> To avoid bankruptcy they appealed for funds to [[Manchester City Council|Manchester Corporation]], which set up a Ship Canal Committee. On 9&nbsp;March 1891 the corporation decided, on the committee's recommendation, to lend the necessary <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million, to preserve the city's prestige. In return the corporation was allowed to appoint five of the fifteen&nbsp;members of the board of directors. The company subsequently raised its estimates of the cost of completion in September 1891 and again in June 1892. An executive committee was appointed as an emergency measure in December 1891, and on 14&nbsp;October 1892 the Ship Canal Committee resolved to lend a further <U+00A3>1.5&nbsp;million on condition that Manchester Corporation had an absolute majority on the canal company's board of directors and its various sub-committees.<ref name="Willan 1977 174"/> The corporation subsequently appointed 11 of the 21&nbsp;seats,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cumberlidge|2009|p=184}}</ref> nominated [[Alderman]] Sir John Harwood as deputy director of the company, and secured majorities on five of the board's six sub-committees. The cost to Manchester Corporation of financing the Ship Canal Company had a significant impact on local taxpayers. Manchester's municipal debt rose by 67&nbsp;per cent, resulting in a 26&nbsp;per cent increase in [[rates (tax)|rates]] between 1892 and 1895.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willan|1977|p=175}}</ref>

However well this arrangement served the corporation (subsumed into the newly created Greater Manchester County Council in 1974 until 1986, when the [[unitary authority]] of Manchester City Council was established),<ref>{{citation |title=Greater Manchester County Record Office (with Manchester Archives) Guide to Local Government Records |publisher=Manchester Library & Information Service |url=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=9&sqi=2&ved=0CFEQFjAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.manchester.gov.uk%2Fdownload%2F13442%2Flocal_government_records_guide&rct=j&q=%22Manchester%20Corporation%22%20abolition&ei=yfo-TuHvHoaohAeomsGIBg&usg=AFQjCNH0AfnFVgctIShdumBrzjWI1jgtAg&cad=rja |format=DOC |accessdate=7&nbsp;August 2011}}</ref> by the mid-1980s, it had become "meaningless".  Most of the company's shares were controlled by the property developer [[John Whittaker (businessman)|John Whittaker]], and in 1986 the council agreed to give up all but one of its seats in return for a payment of <U+00A3>10&nbsp;million. The deal extricated Manchester Council from a politically difficult conflict of interest, as Whittaker was proposing to develop a large out of town shopping centre on land owned by the Ship Canal Company at [[Dumplington]], the present-day [[Trafford Centre]]. The council opposed the scheme, believing that it would damage the city centre economy, but accepted that it was "obviously in the interests of the shareholders".<ref name=King98-100>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=98<U+2013>100}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|<U+00A3>7 million was paid in cash and <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million invested in a joint venture company set up by Whittaker and the council, Ship Canal Developments.

===Construction===
[[File:Manchester Ship Canal The Making of Eastham Dock.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Excavation of the Manchester Ship Canal: Eastham Cutting with Mount Manisty in the Distance'' (1891), by [[Benjamin Williams Leader]]<!-- see Morris, Public art collections in NW England, page 78 if a cite is required -->]]
[[Thomas A. Walker|Thomas Walker]] was appointed as contractor, with Edward Leader Williams as chief engineer and designer and general manager. The {{convert|36|mi|adj=on}} route was divided into eight sections, with one engineer responsible for each. The first reached from [[Eastham, Merseyside|Eastham]] to [[Ellesmere Port]]. Mount Manisty, a large mound of earth on a narrow stretch between the canal and the Mersey northwest of Ellesmere Port, was constructed from soil taken from the excavations. It and the adjacent Manisty Cutting were named after the engineer in charge. The last section built was the passage from Weston Point through the [[Runcorn Gap|Runcorn gap]] to [[Norton, Runcorn|Norton]]; the existing docks at Runcorn and [[Weston, Cheshire|Weston]] had to be kept operational until they could be connected to the completed western sections of the ship canal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=46<U+2013>47}}</ref>

For the first two years construction went according to plan, but Walker died on 25&nbsp;November 1889. While his work was continued by his executors, the project suffered a number of setbacks and was hampered by harsh weather and several serious floods. In January 1891, when the project had been expected to have been completed, a severe winter added to the difficulties; the Bridgewater Canal, the company's only source of income, was closed after a fall of ice. The company decided to take over the contracting work and bought all the on site equipment for <U+00A3>400,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|p=53}}</ref>  Some railway companies, whose bridges had to be modified to cross the canal, demanded compensation. The [[London and North Western Railway]] and [[Great Western Railway]] refused to co-operate, and between them demanded about <U+00A3>533,000 for inconvenience.  The Ship Canal Company was unable to demolish the older, low railway bridges until August 1893, when the matter went to arbitration. The railway companies were awarded just over <U+00A3>100,000, a fraction of their combined claims.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=61<U+2013>62}}</ref>

The ship canal was by the end of 1891 open to shipping as far as Saltport, the name given to wharves built at the entrance to the Weaver Navigation.  The success of the new port was a source of consternation to merchants in Liverpool, who suddenly found themselves cut out of the trade in goods such as timber, and a source of encouragement to shipping companies, who began to realise the advantages an inland port would offer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=59<U+2013>60}}</ref>  Saltport was rendered useless when the ship canal was completely filled with water in November 1893.  The [[Manchester Ship Canal Police]] were formed the following month.<ref>{{citation |date=13 August 2010 |title=Manchester Ship Canal Police |journal=Magazine of the Police Memorabilia Collectors Club |issue=149}}</ref> It opened to its first traffic on 1&nbsp;January 1894.

===Operational history===
[[File:Manchester Ship Canal viewed from the air.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The ship canal alongside the Mersey between [[Stanlow Refinery|Stanlow]] and [[Runcorn]], looking east]]
The Manchester Ship Canal enabled the newly-created [[Port of Manchester]] to become Britain's third busiest port, despite the city being about {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} inland.<ref name=GrayP6>{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=6}}</ref> Since its opening in 1894 the canal has handled a wide range of ships and cargos, from coastal vessels to intra-European shipping and inter-continental cargo liners. The first vessel to unload its cargo on the opening day was the ''Pioneer'', belonging to the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-operative Wholesale Society]] (CWS), which was also the first vessel registered at Manchester; the CWS operated a weekly service to [[Rouen]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=25}}</ref>

[[Manchester Liners]] established regular sailings by large ocean-going vessels. In late 1898 the ''Manchester City'', at 7,698&nbsp;[[gross tonnage|gross tons]], became the largest vessel to reach the terminal docks. Carrying cattle and general cargo, it was met by the Lord Mayor of Manchester and a large welcoming crowd.<ref name="Haws 2000 19">{{Harvnb|Haws|2000|p=19}}</ref>  In 1968 Manchester Liners converted its fleet to container vessels only. To service them it built two dedicated container terminals next to No. 9 Dock.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stoker|1985|p=55}}</ref> The four container vessels commissioned that year, each of 11,898 gross tons, were the largest ever to make regular use of the terminal docks at Salford.<ref name=HawsP43>{{Harvnb|Haws|2000|p=43}}</ref>  In 1974 the canal handled 2.9&nbsp;million long tons (3.25&nbsp;million short tons) of dry cargo, 27&nbsp;per cent of which was carried by Manchester Liners.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Monopolies and Mergers Commission|1976|p=35}}</ref> The dry tonnage was, and is still, greatly supplemented by crude and refined oil products transported in large tanker ships to and from the [[Queen Elizabeth II Dock]] at Eastham and the [[Stanlow Refinery]] just east of Ellesmere Port, and also in smaller tankers to Runcorn. The limitations imposed by the canal on the maximum size of container vessel meant that by the mid-1970s Manchester Liners was becoming uncompetitive; the company sold its last ship in 1985.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gray|1993|p=118}}</ref>

The amount of freight carried by the canal peaked in 1958 at 18&nbsp;million long tons (20&nbsp;million short tons), but the increasing size of ocean-going ships and the port's failure to introduce modern freight-handling methods resulted in that headline figure dropping steadily, and the closure of the docks in Salford in 1984.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kirkwood|2004|p=83}}</ref> Total freight movements on the ship canal were down to 7.56&nbsp;million long tons (8.47&nbsp;million short tons) by 2000, and further reduced to 6.60&nbsp;million long tons (7.39&nbsp;million short tons) for the year ending September 2009.<ref>{{citation |title=Port Statistics |url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dft.gov.uk/excel/173025/221412/221658/236005/portstatsq309.xls/ | publisher = dft.gov.uk, hosted at webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk | format=XLS |accessdate=29&nbsp;July 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Snowdrop at irlam locks on manchester ship canal.jpg|thumb|The passenger ferry ''Snowdrop'' at Irlam Locks]]
The canal was completed just as the [[Long Depression|Great Depression]] was coming to an end,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chaloner|1990|p=188}}</ref> but it was never the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for. Many ship owners were reluctant to dispatch ocean-going vessels along a "locked cul-de-sac" at a maximum speed of {{convert|6|knot}}. The Ship Canal Company found it difficult to attract a diversified export trade, which meant that ships not uncommonly had to return down the canal loaded with ballast rather than freight. The only staple imports attracted to the Port of Manchester were [[kerosene|lamp oil]] and bananas, the latter from 1902 until 1911. As the import trade in oil began to grow during the 20th century the balance of canal traffic switched to the west, from Salford to Stanlow, eventually culminating in the closure of the docks at Salford. Historian Thomas Stuart Willan has observed that "What may seem to require explanation is not the comparative failure of the Ship Canal but the unquenchable vitality of the myth of its success".<ref name=WillanPP179-190>{{Harvnb|Willan|1977|pp=179<U+2013>190}}</ref>

Unlike most other British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised.  In 1984 [[City of Salford|Salford City Council]] used a derelict land grant to purchase the docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company,<ref name="Milestones">{{citation |url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/milestones_v2.pdf |title=Salford Quays Milestones: The Story of Salford Quays | publisher = salford.gov.uk | page = 3 | accessdate=21&nbsp;August 2009}}</ref> rebranding the area as [[Salford Quays]].

==Route==
[[File:Ship canal map.png|thumb|right|330px|Route of the Manchester Ship Canal]]
{{Manchester Ship Canal map}}

===Geography===
From Eastham the canal runs parallel to, and along the south side of the Mersey estuary, past Ellesmere Port. Between [[Rixton]], east of the [[M6 motorway]]'s [[Thelwall Viaduct]] and Irlam, the canal joins the Mersey; thereafter it roughly follows the route the river used to take.  At the confluence of the Mersey and Irwell near Irlam, the canal follows the old course of the River Irwell into Manchester.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rennison|1996|p=264}}</ref>

===Locks, sluices and weirs===
Vessels travelling to and from the terminal docks, which are {{convert|60|ft}} above sea level, must pass through several locks.  Each set has a large lock for ocean-going ships and a smaller, narrower lock for vessels such as tugs and coasters.<ref name="GrayP72">{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=69}}</ref> The entrance locks at Eastham on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] side of the Mersey, which seal off the tidal estuary, are the largest on the canal. The larger lock is {{convert|600|ft}} long by {{convert|80|ft}} wide; the smaller lock is {{convert|350|ft}} by {{convert|50|ft}}. Four additional sets of locks lie further inland, {{convert|600|ft}} long and {{convert|65|ft}} wide and {{convert|350|ft}} by {{convert|45|ft}} for the smaller lock;<ref name=Farnie>{{Harvnb|Farnie|1980|pp=132<U+2013>133}}</ref> each has a rise of approximately {{convert|15|ft}}.<ref name="GrayP72"/> The locks are at Eastham; [[Latchford]], near Warrington; Irlam; [[Barton-upon-Irwell|Barton]] near [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] and Mode Wheel, Salford.<ref name=GrayP72/>

Five sets of sluices and two weirs are used to control the canal's depth.  The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are designed to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner.  Each consists of a set of mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers.  Originally, manually operated [[Francis Goold Morony Stoney|Stoney Sluice]]s were used;{{#tag:ref|A Stoney Sluice gate runs on bearings, negating the friction caused by the weight of water on the gate.|group="nb"}} these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s.  The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers.  Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.<ref name="operational protocol">{{Citation | title = Manchester Ship Canal Company Water Level Control - Operational Protocol | url = http://www.trafford.gov.uk/environmentandplanning/strategicplanning/localdevelopmentframework/corestrategyexaminationinpublicdocuments/documents/1045-peel-holdings/Appendix-2-Operational-Protocol-between-MSCC-and-the-EA.pdf | format = PDF | pages = 4<U+2013>14 | date = January 2011 | publisher = trafford.gov.uk | accessdate = 15&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref>

Woolston Siphon Weir, built in 1994 to replace an earlier structure and located on an extant section of the Mersey near Latchford, controls the amount of water in the Latchford [[Canal pound|Pond]] by emptying canal water into the Mersey.  Howley Weir controls water levels downstream of Woolston Weir.  Further upstream, Woolston Guard Weir enables maintenance to be carried out on both.<ref name="operational protocol"/>

===Docks and wharfs===
Seven terminal docks were constructed for the opening of the canal. Four small docks were located on the south side of the canal near Cornbrook, within the Borough of [[Stretford]]: Pomona Docks No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The three main docks, built primarily for large ocean-going vessels, were in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], to the west of Trafford Road on the north bank of the canal, docks No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8. In 1905, No. 9 Dock was completed on the same site.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=31}}</ref> Dock No. 5, known as Ordsall Dock, was part of Pomona Docks, but was dug on the Salford side of the river; it was never completed and was filled in around 1905.<ref name=OwenPP80-82>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=80<U+2013>82}}</ref>

[[Pomona Docks]] have also been filled in except for the still intact No. 3 Dock, and are largely derelict. A lock at No. 3 Dock connects it to the nearby Bridgewater Canal at the point where the two canals run in parallel. The western four docks have been converted into the Salford Quays development; ships using the Manchester Ship Canal now dock at various places along the canal side such as Mode Wheel (Salford), Trafford Park, and Ellesmere Port.<ref name="Gray 1997 56">{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=56}}</ref> Most ships have to terminate at Salford Quays, although vessels capable of passing under Trafford Road swing bridge (permanently closed in 1992) can continue up the River Irwell to Hunts Bank, near [[Manchester Cathedral]].<ref name=OwenPP124>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=124}}</ref><ref>{{citation|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|date=9 April 1996|title=Bridge swings tram link savings}}</ref>

In 1893 the Ship Canal Company sold a parcel of land just east of the Mode Wheel Locks to the newly established Manchester Dry Docks Company. The [[Drydock#Types|graving docks]] were constructed adjacent to the south bank of the canal, and a floating pontoon dock was built nearby.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=82}}</ref> Each of the three graving docks could accommodate ocean-going ships of up to {{convert|535|ft|m|1}} in length and {{convert|64|ft|m|1}} in beam,<ref>{{Harvnb|The Monopolies and Mergers Commission|1976|p=37}}</ref> equivalent to vessels of 8,000&nbsp;gross tons.

With the predicted traffic for the canal slow to materialise, Hooley and [[Marshall Stevens]] (the general manager of the Ship Canal Company) came to see the benefits that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to both the ship canal and the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates,<ref name="Nicholls 1996 24"/> where he remained until 1930, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director.<ref name=NichollsP112>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=112}}</ref>

Within five years Trafford Park, Europe's largest [[industrial estate]], was home to forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were [[grain silo]]s; the grain was used for flour and as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] for ships carrying raw [[cotton]]. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the [[Manchester Blitz]] in 1940) was Europe's largest grain elevator. The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 it bought the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK's largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos.<ref name= P-B128 >{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=128}}
</ref>

Inland from the canal [[British Westinghouse|the British Westinghouse Electric Company]] bought 11&nbsp;per cent of the estate. Westinghouse's American architect [[Charles Heathcote]] was responsible for much of the planning and design of their factory, which built [[steam turbine]]s and [[turbo generator]]s. By 1899 Heathcote had also designed fifteen warehouses for the Manchester Ship Canal Company.<ref name= P-B128 />

===Manchester Ship Canal Railway===
[[File:Manchester Ship Canal Hunslet 0-6-0T number 686 The Lady Armaghdale at Bridgnorth.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A preserved Manchester Ship Canal Railway 0-6-0T locomotive, now on display at [[The Engine House]] in Highley<ref>{{citation |title=Meet the Stars of the Show&nbsp;... |url=http://www.svr.co.uk/EngineHouse_TheStarsOfTheShow.aspx |publisher=svr.co.uk |accessdate=7&nbsp;August 2011}}</ref>]]
Trafford Park was linked to the canal's docks by the [[standard gauge]] Manchester Ship Canal Railway.  It was built to service freight to and from the canal's docks and nearby industrial estates, and connected to the various railway companies that had track near the canal. Unlike most other railway companies in the UK it was not nationalised in 1948, and grew to become the largest private railway system in the country; at its peak it had 790&nbsp;employees,<ref name="Gray 1997 101">{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=101}}</ref> 75&nbsp;locomotives, 2,700&nbsp;wagons and more than {{convert|200|mi}} of track.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gray|1993|p=57}}</ref>

The MSC Railway was able to receive and despatch goods trains to and from all the UK's main line railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks. Two were to the north of the canal, operated by the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] and the [[London and North Western Railway]], and one was to the south, operated by the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]].<ref name="Gray 1997 101"/>

The MSC's steam locomotives were designed to negotiate the tight-radius curves of the tracks on which they ran; the middle wheels of the 0-6-0 arrangement were flangeless, and the coupling rods had a hinged central section that permitted several inches of lateral play. A fleet of diesel locomotives was purchased between 1959 and 1966, but it was eventually run down and the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gray|1997|p=108}}</ref> The last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, was closed on 30&nbsp;April 2009.<ref>{{citation |title=Manchester Ship Canal Railway Finally Closes {{subscription required}} |magazine=Railways Illustrated |date=September 2009 |page=48 |url=http://media.web.britannica.com/ebsco/pdf/775/44250775.pdf |accessdate=20&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref>

At Ellesmere Port the canal is joined by the [[Shropshire Union Canal]], at a site now occupied by the [[National Waterways Museum, Ellesmere Port|National Waterways Museum]]. The area formerly consisted of a {{convert|7|acre|adj=on}} canal port linking the Shropshire Union Canal to the River Mersey. Designed by [[Thomas Telford]], it remained operational until the 1950s. It was a "marvellously self-contained world" with [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], [[Dock (maritime)|docks]], warehouses, a blacksmith's forge, stables, and cottages for the workers.<ref>{{citation |url=http://nwm.org.uk/Explorethemuseum.html |title=Explore the Museum |accessdate=29&nbsp;November 2008  |publisher=nwm.org.uk}}</ref> Its Island Warehouse was built in 1871 to store grain.<ref name=iswar>{{citation |url=http://nwm.org.uk/TheIslandWarehouse.html |title=Island Warehouse |accessdate=29&nbsp;November 2008 |publisher=nwm.org.uk}}</ref> A few miles from Ellesmere Port, at Weston, near [[Runcorn]], the ship canal also connects with the [[River Weaver|Weaver Navigation]].<ref name=OwenPP122-123>{{Harvnb|Owen|1983|pp=122<U+2013>123}}</ref>

==Ecology==
[[File:Woolston Eyes - geograph.org.uk - 1530284.jpg|right|thumb|[[Woolston Eyes]] nature reserve, near [[Thelwall]]]]
The quality of water in the ship canal remains adversely affected by several factors.  The high population density of the Mersey Basin has, historically, placed heavy demands on sewage treatment and disposal.  Industrial and agricultural discharges into the Irwell, [[River Medlock|Medlock]] and [[River Irk|Irk]] rivers are responsible for a number of industrial containments found in the canal.  Matters have improved since 1990, when the [[National Rivers Authority]] found the area between Trafford Road Bridge and Mode Wheel Locks to be "grossly polluted".  The water was [[anoxic waters|depleted of dissolved oxygen]], which in the latter half of the 20th century often resulted in toxic sediments normally present at the bottom of the Turning Basin in what is now Salford Quays rising to the surface during the summer months, giving the impression of solid ground.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|Waterfall|White|Hendry|2010|pp=278<U+2013>283}}</ref>  Previously, only [[Common Roach|roach]] and [[stickleback]]s could be found in the canal's upper levels, and then only during the colder parts of the year, but an oxygenation project implemented at Salford Quays from 2001, together with the gradual reduction of industrial pollutants from the Mersey's tributaries, has encouraged the migration into the canal of fish populations from further upstream.  The canal's water quality remains low, with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[cadmium]] in particular present at "extremely high levels".<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|Waterfall|White|Hendry|2010|p=282}}</ref> Episodic pollution and a lack of habitat remain problems for wildlife, although in 2005, for the first time in living memory, [[salmon]] were observed breeding in the [[River Goyt]] (a part of the Mersey's catchment).  In 2010 the Environment Agency issued a report concluding that the canal "does not pose a significant barrier to salmon movement or impact on migratory behaviours".<ref>{{Citation | last = Billington | first = Sam | title = Salmon behaviour in the Mersey Catchment | url = http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Salmon_behaviour_in_the_Mersey_Catchment_FINAL.pdf | page = 10 | publisher = environment-agency.gov.uk | year = 2010 | accessdate = 18&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Hendry | first = Keith | title = Moving the Mersey | url = http://www.merseybasin.org.uk/archive/assets/194/original/SourceNW__Issue_9.pdf | publisher = merseybasin.org.uk | date = August 2005 | pages = 5,&nbsp;27 | accessdate = 18&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Manchester Ship Canal, Strategic Review of Fish Populations | url = http://www.apemltd.co.uk/DocStore/FileLibrary/PDFs/Manchester%20Ship%20Canal%20-%20Strategic%20Review%20of%20Fish%20Populations.pdf | publisher = apemltd.co.uk | page = 9 | date = September 2007 | accessdate = 15&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref>

Despite the canal's poor water quality there are several nature reserves along its banks. [[Wigg Island]], a former [[brownfield site]] east of [[Runcorn]], contains a network of public footpaths through newly planted woodlands and meadows.  Among the wildlife species found there are [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], [[kestrel]]s, [[swallow]]s and [[house martin]]s.<ref>{{Citation | title = Wigg Island | url = http://www2.halton.gov.uk/pdfs/environment/nature/wiggislandlnr | publisher = halton.gov.uk | accessdate = 18&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref>  Further upstream the {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} [[Moore Nature Reserve]], which is bisected by the de-watered [[Runcorn to Latchford Canal]], comprises lakes, woodland and meadows.  The reserve is open to the public and contains a number of [[bird hide]]s, from which native [[owl]]s and [[woodpecker]]s may be viewed.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.wrg.co.uk/page.php?article=755&name=Moore+About+Us|title=Moore Nature Reserve|publisher=wrg.co.uk|accessdate=17&nbsp;September 2011}}</ref>  Near [[Thelwall]], [[Woolston Eyes]] (a corruption of the Saxon ''[[Ees (place name)|Ees]]''), is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].  It is used as a deposit for canal dredgings and is a habitat for many species of bird, including [[Black-necked Grebe]]s, [[Grasshopper Warbler]]s, [[Blackcap]]s and [[Common Whitethroat]]s.  [[Great Crested Newt]]s and [[Viperidae|Adder]]s are present, and local flora includes [[orchids]] and [[Broad-leaved Helleborine]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kindersley|2009|p=77}}</ref>  Diving ducks are regular visitors to Salford Quays, where species such as [[Common Pochard|Pochard]] and [[Tufted Duck]]s feed on winter nights.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Marsen | first1 = S.
