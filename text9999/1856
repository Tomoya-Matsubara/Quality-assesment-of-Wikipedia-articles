Barr began refereeing matches for [[Pacific Northwest Wrestling]] promoter [[Don Owen (Wrestling Promoter)|Don Owen]] in the 1960s because it allowed him to spend more time at home with his family.<ref name=canoesports1>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/06/02/4229912.html|title=Northwest mainstay Sandy Barr dies|accessdate=2007-06-03|date=2007-06-02}}</ref><ref name=savageinterviews>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchsavage.com/wrestlinginterviews.html|title=Interview with Sandy Barr |accessdate=2007-05-11|date=June 2006}}</ref>  As a promoter, Barr was known as a person who would take care of the wrestlers.  [[Dynamite Kid|Tom "The Dynamite Kid" Billington]] said of Barr, "The only time he made anything was once a year when all the big names came in, like [[Harley Race]] and [[Andr<U+00E9> the Giant]], and then they'd do great business. Sold out every night. Sandy would be so excited about making all this money, after he'd paid the big names, he gave the rest of it to us, the wrestlers who were there every week. All year long he'd be scraping by, and, when he did make some money, he gave it away. But he was a very good, kindhearted man, a great man<U+2014>especially for a promoter."<ref name=billingtonquote>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/06/03/4231164.html|title=Promoter Sandy Barr loved the business
