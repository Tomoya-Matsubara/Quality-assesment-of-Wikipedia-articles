==History==
[[File:George Gould, ca 1923.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George Gould in ca 1923]]
[[George Gould (businessman)|George Gould]] (1865<U+2013>1941) was a successful businessman, farmer and stock breeder. He was a director of [[The Press]] from 1903 until his death with one brief interruption. He chaired the board through the years of the Christchurch newspaper war in 1934<U+2013>1935.<ref name="DNZB Gould">{{DNZB|Rice|Geoffrey W.|4g16|George Gould|28 May 2011}}</ref> His company, Pyne Gould Corporation Limited, is these days part of the [[NZSX50]]. 

After World War I, many ideas for a war memorial were put forward. Gould proposed a column opposite of [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]] and by 1920, this was one of the three dominant proposals. The [[Bridge of Remembrance, Christchurch|Bridge of Remembrance]] was adopted, while the hall of memories idea disappeared due to lack of support.<ref name=register /><ref name="DNZB Gould" /> Gould's idea received the support of the Canterbury Anglican elite. While the Bridge of Remembrance was unveiled in 1924, the Christchurch City Council opposed the Cathedral Square proposal and stopped it from going ahead. The argument was that the Cathedral would dwarf the memorial, and that the bustling nature of the Square was an inappropriate setting for a place of reflection.<ref name="DNZB Trethewey" /> In 1933, the [[Godley Statue]] was relocated from its position just north of the Cathedral to its original location opposite it. Gould seized the opportunity and proposed the vacated site for the memorial, and the Anglican Church as the owner of the land agreed under the condition that a cross be incorporated into the design. Gould promoted the memorial as "an emblem of peace rather than ... war". While the original intention was to import statuary from England, the manufacturers' association wanted the work to be done locally and put Trethewey's name forward, but the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association|Returned Services' Association]] opposed this as he had not gone to war.<ref name="Bromley Cemetery Guide" />

The design was to be of peace not war; a cross should be included, as well as an expression of high ideals.<ref name="DNZB Trethewey" /> The memorial was designed by the architect George Hart and the Christchurch sculptor [[William Trethewey]] (1892<U+2013>1956).<ref name="DNZB Trethewey">{{DNZB|Phillips|Jock|4t26|William Thomas Trethewey|24 May 2011}}</ref> According to Trethewey's son, the sculptor took out a pencil one lunch and sketched a possible war memorial. He took the sketch to Hart and from this, they produced the design.<ref name="NZ History online">{{cite web|title=Christchurch war memorial|url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/christchurch-war-memorial |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=updated 28 February 2011}}</ref> The design was accepted in 1933, after which Trethewey refined it before carving the figures in clay, boxing them up, and forwarding them for casting to the [[Arthur Bryan Burton]] Foundry in London. Trethewey travelled to London and supervised the casting of the Bronze figures.<ref name="DNZB Trethewey" />
