"'''Nobody Knows Me'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. The song was written and produced by Madonna and [[Mirwais Ahmadza<U+00EF>]] for her ninth studio album ''[[American Life]]'' (2003). It was released as a promotional single in the United States on October 15, 2003, with a remixed version appearing on the remix compilation ''[[Remixed & Revisited]]'' (2003). "Nobody Knows Me" carries on the main theme of ''American Life'', with its usage of negative tones on the songs. It is an dance and electronic song, with vocoder effects, spacey synths and a bubbly bass, and lyrically, Madonna rejects tabloid culture's "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines. 

The song received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with many of whom calling it as a highlight from ''American Life''. Four remixes were released in club stations around the United States, with one of them peaking at number four on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. The song, along with "[[Nothing Fails]]", topped the US [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart and also charted on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Club Tracks]] in Australia. Madonna did a performance of the song alone on stage on her [[Re-Invention World Tour]] in 2004. It was also used as a video interlude on her [[MDNA Tour]] in 2012, showing Madonna's face morphed with a number of famous figures. French [[Far-right politics|far right politician]] [[Marine Le Pen]] sued Madonna for superimposing a [[swastika]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s face with hers.

==Background==
''American Life'' became Madonna's final studio album with [[Maverick Records]], and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2004/jun/16/citynews.arts |title=Madonna ends her Maverick era |last=Teather |first=David |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2004-06-16 |accessdate=2010-02-17 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="abc">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=103495&page=1|title=Heads Roll at Madonna's Maverick Label|publisher=[[ABC News]].

"[The songs] are examining things I valued and things I found myself worrying about, caring too much about, and realizing that those things aren't important and wanting to get out from underneath that cloud, the world of illusion", Madonna stated.<ref name="ame song">{{cite web|first=John|last= Norris|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/madonna/news_feature_042203/|title=Madonna: Her American Life|publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom]]|accessdate=2010-11-04|date=2003-04-22}}</ref> According to [[Lucy O'Brien]], author of ''[[Madonna: Like an Icon]]'', the main concept of ''American Life'' was about "nothing".<ref name="lucy"/> This was evident in the titles of the songs like "Nobody Knows Me", usage of "no" in "[[Love Profusion]]", as well as "[[Nothing Fails]]".<ref name="lucy">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=368<U+2013>369}}</ref> Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love.<ref name="lucy"/> O'Brien described the concept of the album and the song:
<blockquote>
"If ''[[Like a Prayer]]'' was her divorce album, ''American Life'' is her psychoanalysis. She even name checks [[Sigmund Freud]] and throws out countless questions. Who am I? Where am I going? What does it all mean? Much of the album is suffused with sarcasm: right from the disaffected ennui of the title track to the stroppiness of 'Nobody Knows Me', Madonna is kicking against the claustrophobic effect of celebrity worship."<ref name="lucy"/>

A remix of the song was featured in Madonna's 2003 compilation ''[[Remixed & Revisited]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479959/madonna-drop-remix-lp.jhtml|title=Madonna's Got A Brand New Bag <U+2014> And Britney's In It
