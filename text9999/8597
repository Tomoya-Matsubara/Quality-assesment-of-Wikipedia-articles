'''LuBara Dixon "Dickey" Simpkins''' (born [[April 6]], [[1972]] in [[Fort Washington, Maryland]]) is an American professional [[basketball]] player best known for his tenure with the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the late [[1990s]].

A 6' 9" [[power forward (basketball)|forward]]/[[center (basketball)|center]], Simpkins starred at [[Friendly High School]] (Maryland) and [[Providence College]] before being selected by the Bulls with the 21st pick in the [[1994 NBA Draft]].  Caught behind [[Luc Longley]], [[Bill Wennington]], and later [[Dennis Rodman]] in the Bulls' playing rotation, he saw limited action in his first few seasons as a Bull, scoring just 513 points in 167 games.  He did earn two [[NBA Finals|NBA Championship]] rings in [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]] and [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], but he was not on the team's active roster for either playoff run, and in fall 1997 the Bulls traded him to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for [[guard (basketball)|guard]]/[[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[Scott Burrell]].  

When the Warriors subsequently waived Simpkins, however, the Bulls decided to give him another chance.  Simpkins began to show some improvement, posting a respectable .634 [[field goal percentage]] in 21 games, and in the spring of [[1998]] he participated in the playoffs for the first time of his career, earning his third championship ring.  After the [[1998-99 NBA season|1998-99 NBA lockout]], the Bulls parted ways with [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]], [[Dennis Rodman]], and [[Luc Longley]], which provided Simpkins with significantly more playing time.  During the [[1999]] season he emerged as a part-time starter, averaging career highs of 9.1 points and 6.8 rebounds, and in the following season, he played in a career-high 1,651 minutes.  

After the Bulls signed [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Brad Miller]] in September [[2000]], the Bulls renounced their rights to Simpkins, who would spend a season in [[Greece]] before joining the [[Atlanta Hawks]] during the [[2001-02 NBA season]].  He only played one game for the Hawks, though, and spent the rest of the season in Greece and the [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]].  Since [[2002]], Simpkins has enjoyed a lengthy overseas career, playing in [[Russia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Lithuania]], [[Spain]], [[Philippines]] and [[Lebanon]].<ref>http://www.euroleague.net/noticia.jsp?temporada=E05&jornada=15&id=788</ref>  He most recently played for [[GHP Bamberg]] of the [[Bundesliga (basketball)|German basketball league]].  During the summer of [[2006]] he was seen working out at the Berto Center, the Chicago Bulls' training facility.  However, he did not join the team for training camp.<ref>[http://www.realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/42205/20060913/simpkins_working_out_in_chicago/ http://www.realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/42205/20060913/simpkins_working_out_in_chicago/] Retrieved 13 September 2006.</ref>
