'''Female genital mutilation''' ('''FGM'''), also known as '''female genital cutting''' and '''female circumcision''', is the ritual removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser with a blade or razor, with or without anaesthesia, FGM is concentrated in 27 countries in Africa, as well as in Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan, and practised to a lesser extent elsewhere in Asia and among diaspora communities around the world.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;44 (traditional circumciser), pp.&nbsp;45<U+2013>46 (anaesthesia), p.&nbsp;46 (blade or razor), pp.&nbsp;26<U+2013>27 (for the 29 countries).</ref> The age at which it is conducted varies from days after birth to puberty; in half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.<ref name=UNICEF2013p47,50/>

The procedures differ according to the ethnic group. They include removal of the [[clitoral hood]] and [[clitoris]], and in the most severe form (known as [[#Type III|infibulation]]) removal of the [[Labia minora|inner]] and [[Labia majora|outer labia]] and closure of the [[vulva]]; in this last procedure, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, and the [[vagina]] is opened for intercourse and childbirth. Health effects depend on the procedure, but can include recurrent infections, chronic pain, cysts, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth and fatal bleeding.<ref name=Abdulcadira>Jasmine Abdulcadira, et al, [http://www.smw.ch/content/smw-2011-13137/ "Care of women with female genital mutilation/cutting"], ''Swiss Medical Weekly'', 6(14), January 2011 (review). {{PMID|21213149}} {{doi|10.4414/smw.2011.13137}}</ref> There are no known health benefits.<ref name=WHO2008p1health>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf "Eliminating Female genital mutilation: An Interagency Statement"], OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNECA, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIFEM, WHO, 2008 (hereafter WHO 2008), p.&nbsp;1: "Female genital mutilation has no known health benefits."</ref>

The practice is rooted in gender inequality, attempts to control women's sexuality, and ideas about purity, modesty and aesthetics. It is initiated and usually carried out by women, who see it as a source of honour, and who fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to social exclusion.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;15: "There is a social obligation to conform to the practice and a widespread belief that if they [families] do not, they are likely to pay a price that could include social exclusion, criticism, ridicule, stigma or the inability to find their daughters suitable marriage partners."<p>
[[Nahid Toubia|Nahid F. Toubia]], Eiman Hussein Sharief, [http://www.ijgo.org/article/S0020-7292%2803%2900229-7/fulltext "Female genital mutilation: have we made progress?"], ''International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics'', 82(3), September 2003, pp.&nbsp;251<U+2013>261: "One of the great achievements of the past decade in the field of FGM is the shift in emphasis from the concern over the harmful physical effects it causes to understanding this act as a social phenomenon resulting from a gender definition of women's roles, in particular their sexual and reproductive roles. This shift in emphasis has helped redefine the issues from a clinical disease model (hence the terminology of eradication prevalent in the literature) to a problem resulting from the use of culture to protect social dominance over women's bodies by the patriarchal hierarchy. Understanding the operative mechanisms of patriarchal dominance must also include understanding how women, particularly older married women, are important keepers of that social hegemony." {{PMID|14499972}} {{doi|10.1016/S0020-7292(03)00229-7}}</ref> Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.<ref name=125million/> Over eight million have been infibulated, a practice found largely in Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan.<ref name=Yoder2008p13/>

FGM has been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, but the laws are poorly enforced.<ref>For countries in which it is outlawed or restricted, [http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;8; for enforcement, [https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2013/UNICEF-UNFPA%20Joint%20Programme%20AR_final_v14.pdf UNFPA<U+2013>UNICEF 2012], p.&nbsp;48.</ref> There have been international efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon it, and in 2012 the [[United Nations General Assembly]], recognizing FGM as a human-rights violation, voted unanimously to intensify those efforts.<ref name=UN/> The opposition is not without its critics, particularly among anthropologists. [[Eric Silverman]] writes that FGM has become one of anthropology's central moral topics, raising difficult questions about cultural relativism, tolerance and the universality of human rights.<ref>[[Eric Silverman|Eric K. Silverman]], [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25064860 "Anthropology and Circumcision"], ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 33, 2004 (pp.&nbsp;419<U+2013>445), pp.&nbsp;420, 427.</ref>

Until the 1980s FGM was widely known as female circumcision, which implied an equivalence in severity with [[male circumcision]].<ref>[[Martha Nussbaum]], ''Sex and Social Justice'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oCpg=PA119 119].</ref> In 1929 the [[National Council of Churches of Kenya|Kenya Missionary Council]] began referring to it as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of Marion Scott Stevenson, a [[Church of Scotland]] missionary.<ref>James Karanja, ''The Missionary Movement in Colonial Kenya: The Foundation of Africa Inland Church'', G<U+00F6>ttingen: Cuvillier Verlag, 2009, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&pg=PA93 93], n.&nbsp;631.</ref> References to it as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], p.&nbsp;22.</ref> Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes called it female genital mutilation in 1975 in the title of a paper, and in 1979 Austrian-American researcher [[Fran Hosken]] called it mutilation in her influential ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females''.<ref>Rose Oldfield Hayes, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/643328 "Female Genital Mutilation, Fertility Control, Women's Roles, and the Patrilineage in Modern Sudan: A Functional Analysis"], ''American Ethnologist'' 2(4), November 1975, pp.&nbsp;617<U+2013>633.<p>

Robertson (eds.), ''Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood'', Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2002 (pp.&nbsp;54<U+2013>86), p.&nbsp;60: "The ''Hosken Report'' is the single most influential document responsible for raising consciousness of FGC."</ref>

The [[Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children]] and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) began referring to it as female genital mutilation in 1990 and 1991 respectively.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp.&nbsp;6<U+2013>7.</ref> In April 1997 the WHO, [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) and [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) issued a joint statement using that term. Other terms often used include female genital cutting (FGC) and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), preferred by those working with practitioners.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], pp.&nbsp;4, 22.</ref>

===Local terms===
The many variants of FGM, which depend on the ethnic group and individual practitioner, are reflected in dozens of local terms in countries where it is common.<ref name=UNICEF2013p48/50terms/> These often refer to purification. A common [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for purification has the root t-h-r, used for male and female circumcision (''tahur'' and ''tahara'').<ref>[[Fadwa El Guindi]], "Had ''This'' Been Your Face, Would You Leave It as Is?" in Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf (ed.), ''Female Circumcision: Multicultural Perspectives'', Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&pg=PA30 30].</ref> In the [[Bambara language]], spoken mostly in Mali, FGM is known as ''bolokoli'' ("washing your hands") and in the [[Igbo language]] in Eastern Nigeria as ''isa aru'' or ''iwu aru'' ("having your bath," as in "a young woman must 'have her bath' before she has a baby").<ref>Chantal Zabus, "The Excised Body in African Texts and Contexts," in Merete Falck Borch (ed.), ''Bodies and Voices: The Force-field of Representation and Discourse in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies'', New York: Rodopi, 2008, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xZmWF3qxHo4C&pg=PA47 47].<p>

''Sunna'' circumcision usually implies [[clitoridectomy]], but is also used for the more severe forms; ''[[Sunnah|sunna]]'' means "path or way" in Arabic and refers to the tradition of [[Muhammad]], although the procedure is not required within Islam.<ref>Ibrahim Lethome Asmani, Maryam Sheikh Abdi, [http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2011/De-linking%20FGM%20from%20Islam%20final%20report.pdf "Delinking Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting from Islam"], USAID/UNFPA, 2008, p.&nbsp;3.<p>
That ''sunna'' can refer to more severe forms, [[Ellen Gruenbaum]], ''The Female Circumcision Controversy: An Anthropological Perspective'', Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=JOXmOLBd4E4C&pg=PA2 2].</ref> ''Nuss'' ("half") in Sudan is for anything between clitoridectomy and infibulation, and ''juwaniya'' ("the inside type") is where the inner labia are sewn together.<ref>Gruenbaum 2001, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=JOXmOLBd4E4C&pg=PA155 155].</ref> The term ''[[infibulation]]'' derives from [[Fibula (brooch)|''fibula'']], Latin for clasp; the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] reportedly fastened the foreskins or labia of male and female slaves with clasps to prevent sexual intercourse. The surgical infibulation of women came to be known as pharaonic circumcision in Sudan, but as Sudanese circumcision in Egypt.<ref>Leonard J. Kouba, Judith Muasher, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/524569 "Female Circumcision in Africa: An Overview"], ''African Studies Review'', 28(1), March 1985 (pp.&nbsp;95<U+2013>110), pp.&nbsp;96<U+2013>97.</ref> In Somalia it is known simply as ''qodob'' ("to sew up").<ref>[[Raqiya Haji Dualeh Abdalla|Raqiya D. Abdalla]], {{" '}}My Grandmother Called it the Three Feminine Sorrows': The Struggle of Women Against Female Circumcision in Somalia," in Abusharaf 2007, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&pg=PA190 190].</ref>

==Procedures, health effects==
===Circumcisers, methods===
[[File:Clitoris anatomy labeled-en.svg|right|thumb|alt=diagram|Anatomy of the [[vulva]], showing the [[clitoral glans]], [[Crus of clitoris|clitoral crura]], [[Corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpora cavernosa]] and [[Bulb of vestibule|vestibular bulbs]]]]

The procedures are generally performed by a traditional circumciser in the girls' homes, with or without anaesthesia. The circumciser is usually an older woman; in communities where the male [[Barber#History|barber]] has assumed the role of health worker, he will perform FGM too.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp.&nbsp;42<U+2013>44 and Table 5, p.&nbsp;181 (for cutters), p.&nbsp;46 (for home and anaesthesia).<p>
Michael Miller and Francesca Moneti, [http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf ''Changing a harmful social convention: Female genital cutting/mutilation''], Florence: UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre, 2005, p.&nbsp;7: "The large majority of girls and women are cut by a traditional practitioner, a category which includes local specialists (cutters or ''exciseuses''), traditional birth attendants and, generally, older members of the community, usually women. This is true for over 80 percent of the girls who undergo the practice in Benin, Burkina Faso, C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Yemen. In most countries, medical personnel, including doctors, nurses and certified midwives, are not widely involved in the practice."</ref> In Egypt, Sudan and Kenya, FGM is carried out by health professionals; surveys in Egypt in 1997<U+2013>2011 indicated that 77 percent of FGM procedures were performed by medical professionals, often physicians.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp.&nbsp;43<U+2013>45: "In some countries, such as Egypt, Sudan and Kenya&nbsp;... a substantial number of health-care providers perform the procedure. This phenomenon is most acute in Egypt, where mothers report that in three out of four cases (77 per cent), FGM/C was performed on their daughters by a trained medical professional. In Egypt, this is most often a doctor, the only country where this holds true. In most countries where medical personnel play a significant role in performing FGM/C, nurses, midwives or other trained health personnel carry out the procedure" (p.&nbsp;43). See p.&nbsp;45 for the reference to 1997<U+2013>2011 surveys.</ref>

When traditional circumcisers are involved, non-sterile cutting devices are likely to be used, including knives, razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks and fingernails.<ref name=Kelly2005p491>Elizabeth Kelly, Paula J. Adams Hillard, [http://journals.lww.com/co-obgyn/Abstract/2005/10000/Female_genital_mutilation.9.aspx "Female genital mutilation"], ''Current Opinion in Obstetrics & Gynecology'', 17(5), October 2005, pp.&nbsp;490<U+2013>494 (review), p.&nbsp;491. {{PMID|16141763}}</ref> A nurse in Uganda, quoted in 2007 in ''[[The Lancet]]'', said that a circumciser would use one knife to cut up to 30 girls at a time.<ref>Wairagala Wakabi, [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)60508-X/fulltext "Africa battles to make female genital mutilation history"], ''The Lancet'', 369 (9567), 31 March 2007, pp.&nbsp;1069<U+2013>1070. {{PMID|17405200}} {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60508-X}}</ref>

Depending on the involvement of healthcare professionals, the procedures may include a [[Local anesthetic|local]] or [[general anaesthetic]], or neither. Women in Egypt reported in 1995 that a local anaesthetic had been used on their daughters in 60 percent of cases, a general in 13 percent and neither in 25 percent.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;46 (two percent were missing/don't know).</ref>

===Classification{{anchor|classification}}===
====Typologies====
The WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA issued a joint statement in April 1997 defining female genital mutilation as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons."<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], p.&nbsp;4.</ref>

The procedures vary considerably according to ethnicity and individual practitioners. English terms do not always correspond with local ones; in a survey in Niger in 1998, women responded with 50 different terms when asked what was done to them.<ref name=UNICEF2013p48/50terms>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;48.</ref> Translation problems are compounded by the women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. A study in Ghana in 2003 found that women had changed their responses during surveys; when asked if they had undergone FGM, four percent said no in 1995 but yes in 2000, and 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it.<ref>P.

UNICEF divides FGM into (1) cut, no flesh removed (pricking or symbolic circumcision); (2) cut, some flesh removed; (3) sewn closed; and (4) type not determined/unsure/doesn't know.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;48: "These categories do not fully match the WHO typology. ''Cut, no flesh removed'' describes a practice known as nicking or pricking, which currently is categorized as Type IV. ''Cut, some flesh removed'' corresponds to Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type II (excision) combined. And ''sewn closed'' corresponds to Type III, infibulation."</ref> The most common procedures fall within the "cut, some flesh removed" category, and involve complete or partial removal of the clitoris.<ref name=Yoder2013p189TypeI>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;47, Table 5.2; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720002 Yoder, Wang and Johansen, 2013], p.&nbsp;189: "The most common forms of the practice involve the partial or total removal of the clitoris."</ref>

However, in some countries, medicalized female genital mutilation can include removal of the prepuce only (Type Ia) (Thabet and Thabet, 2003), but this form appears to be relatively rare (Satti et al, 2006). Almost all known forms of female genital mutilation that remove tissue from the clitoris also cut all or part of the clitoral glans itself."<p>

Type II (excision) is the complete or partial removal of the inner labia, with or without removal of the clitoris and outer labia. (''Excision'' in French usually means any form of FGM.)

Two small cuts are made around the vaginal orifice to expose new tissues to suture, and then sutures are placed to tighten the vaginal orifice and perineum.

Psychologist Hanny Lightfoot-Klein interviewed hundreds of women and men in Sudan in the 1980s about sexual intercourse with Type III:

<div style="background-color:none;margin-right:8em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 10px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify">
The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.&nbsp;... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the "little knife." This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.<ref>Hanny Lightfoot-Klein, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3812643 "The Sexual Experience and Marital Adjustment of Genitally Circumcised and Infibulated Females in The Sudan"], ''The Journal of Sex Research'', 26(3), 1989 (pp.&nbsp;375<U+2013>392), p.&nbsp;380.<p>

The girl is instructed to pull her genitalia every day, to stretch them further, and to put additional sticks in to hold the stretched parts from time to time. This pulling procedure is repeated daily for a period of about two weeks, and usually no more than four sticks are used to hold the stretched parts, as further pulling and stretching would make the genital parts unacceptably long."</ref>

===Complications===
FGM has no known health benefits.<ref name=WHO2008p1health/> The immediate, short-term and late [[complication (medicine)|complications]] depend on several factors, principally the type of FGM performed. Factors include whether the practitioner had medical training, whether unsterilized or surgical single-use instruments were used, whether surgical thread was used instead of agave or acacia thorns, and whether antibiotics were available. In the case of Type III, other factors include how small a hole was left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, and whether the procedure was performed more than once (for example, to close an opening regarded as too wide or re-open one too small).<ref name=Abdulcadira/>

Late complications vary depending on the type of FGM performed. Jasmine Abdulcadir, a Swiss gynaecologist who offers specialist services to women with FGM, writes that a common complication with infibulation is [[dysmenorrhea|painful periods]], because the menstrual flow has been obstructed. Blood can collect and stagnate in the vagina and uterus. There may be difficult and [[dysuria|painful urination]]; urine may collect underneath the scar and cause small stones to form. In an infibulated virgin the opening is 2<U+2013>3&nbsp;mm; in women who are sexually active or have given birth by vaginal delivery, the hole is larger but the urethra opening may still be obstructed by scar tissue.<ref name=Abdulcadira/> There may be damage to the urethra and bladder, leading to infections and incontinence, [[dyspareunia|pain during sexual intercourse]] and [[infertility]].<ref name=Kelly2005pp491-2>[http://journals.lww.com/co-obgyn/Abstract/2005/10000/Female_genital_mutilation.9.aspx Kelly and Hillard 2005], pp.&nbsp;491<U+2013>492</ref> Other complications include [[epidermoid cyst]]s that may become infected, and [[neuroma]] formation (growth of nerve tissue) involving nerves that supplied the clitoris.<ref>Amish J.

In those settings all types of FGM were found to pose an increased risk of death to the baby: 15 percent higher for Type I, 32 percent for Type II and 55 percent for Type III.<ref name=Banks2006>Emily Banks, et al, [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2806%2968805-3/fulltext "Female genital mutilation and obstetric outcome: WHO collaborative prospective study in six African countries"], ''The Lancet'', 367(9525), 3 June 2006, pp.&nbsp;1835<U+2013>1841. {{PMID|16753486}} {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68805-3}}<p>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr30/en/index.html "New study shows female genital mutilation exposes women and babies to significant risk at childbirth"], World Health Organization, 2 June 2006.</ref>

In Kenya and Tanzania, women aged 45<U+2013>49 years were three times more likely to have been cut than the 15<U+2013>19 cohort.

Women who respond to surveys on FGM are reporting events experienced years ago, so prevalence figures for the 15<U+2013>49 group do not reflect current trends.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;85. Also see p.&nbsp;113.<p>
For example, UNICEF writes (p.&nbsp;85), in Mauritania, where the mean age at cutting is one month old, the 15<U+2013>19 cohort are reporting events from 15<U+2013>19 years ago, whereas in Egypt, where the mean age is 10 years, the cutting for the same group occurred 5<U+2013>9 years ago.</ref> UNICEF bases its figures on the 15<U+2013>49 group because it regards girls as at risk until they are 14.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;23: "The percentage of girls and women of reproductive age (15 to 49) who have experienced any form of FGM/C is the first indicator used to show how widespread the practice is in a particular country&nbsp;...

They are reported as being uncut but are still at risk of undergoing the procedure. Statistics for girls under age 15 therefore need to be interpreted with a high degree of caution&nbsp;..."</ref> An additional complication in judging prevalence among the younger group is that, in countries with campaigns against FGM, women might not report that their daughters have been cut.<ref>UNICEF 2013, pp.&nbsp;25, 100; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720002 Yoder, Wang and Johansen, 2013], p.&nbsp;196.</ref>

In 2011 the DHS and MICS surveys began asking women about the FGM status of all their living daughters.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720002 Yoder, Wang and Johansen, 2013], p.&nbsp;194.</ref> The surveys suggested a prevalence for the 0<U+2013>14 age group of 0.3 percent in Benin at the lowest (7 percent for the 15<U+2013>49 group) to 56 percent in Gambia (76 percent for 15<U+2013>49).<ref name=UNICEF22July2014overview/>

In a study in Egypt in 2008<U+2013>2010 (FGM was banned there by decree in 2007 and criminalized in 2008), 4,158 women and girls aged 5<U+2013>25, who presented to three departments at [[Sohag]] and [[Qena]] University Hospitals, replied to an oral questionnaire about FGM, along with their parents. According to the researchers, the most common form of FGM in Egypt is Type I. The study found that, between 2000 and 2009, 3,711 of the subjects had undergone FGM, giving a prevalence rate of 89.2 percent. The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rate was 9.6 percent in 2000. It began to fall in 2006, and by 2009 had declined to 7.7 percent. After 2007 most of the procedures were conducted by general practitioners; the researchers suggested that the criminalization of FGM had deterred gynaecologists, so general practitioners were doing it instead.<ref name=Rasheedemail2011>Salah M.

Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men living in cities who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after their grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/643328 Hayes 1975], pp.&nbsp;620, 624.</ref> Gerry Mackie compares FGM to [[footbinding]]; like FGM, footbinding was an ethnic marker carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity and appropriate marriage, and supported by women.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210333/http://www.polisci.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/BeginningOfEndMackie2000.pdf Mackie 2000], p.&nbsp;256; [http://pages.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf Mackie 1996], pp.&nbsp;999<U+2013>1000: "Footbinding and infibulation correspond as follows. Both customs are nearly universal where practiced; they are persistent and are practiced even by those who oppose them. Both control sexual access to females and ensure female chastity and fidelity. Both are necessary for proper marriage and family honor. Both are believed to be sanctioned by tradition. Both are said to be ethnic markers, and distinct ethnic minorities may lack the practices. Both seem to have a past of contagious diffusion. Both are exaggerated over time and both increase with status. Both are supported and transmitted by women, are performed on girls about six to eight years old, and are generally not initiation rites. Both are believed to promote health and fertility. Both are defined as aesthetically pleasing compared with the natural alternative. Both are said to properly exaggerate the complementarity of the sexes, and both are claimed to make intercourse more pleasurable for the male."</ref>

Practitioners see the procedures as marking not only community boundaries but also gender difference; FGM demasculinizes women and male circumcision defeminizes men.<ref>Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf, "Introduction: The Custom in Question," in Abusharaf 2007, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&pg=PA8 8]; El Guindi 2007, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&pg=PA36 36<U+2013>37].</ref> [[Fuambai Ahmadu]], an anthropologist and member of the [[Kono people]] of Sierra Leone, who underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a [[Sande society]] initiation, argues that the idea of the clitoris being important to female sexuality is a male-centred assumption. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb.<ref>[[Fuambai Ahmadu]], "Rites and Wrongs: An Insider/Outsider Reflects on Power and Excision," in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&pg=PA284 284<U+2013>285].</ref> Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. "[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny," writes [[Janice Boddy]]. "The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened and exposed."<ref>[[Janice Boddy]], ''Civilizing Women: British Crusades in Colonial Sudan'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&pg=PA112 112]. Also see [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25064860 Silverman 2004], p.&nbsp;429.</ref>

In communities were infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive.<ref>Ellen Gruenbaum, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4005473 "Socio-Cultural Dynamics of Female Genital Cutting: Research Findings, Gaps, and Directions"], ''Culture, Health & Sexuality'', 7(5), September<U+2013>October 2005 (pp.&nbsp;429<U+2013>441), pp.&nbsp;435<U+2013>436.</ref> Men also seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/4005473 Gruenbaum 2005], p.&nbsp;437; Gruenbaum 2001, p.&nbsp;140; [[Janice Boddy]], ''Wombs and Alien Spirits: Women, Men, and the Zar Cult in Northern Sudan'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=TK6NIp5uVwsC&pg=PA52 52].</ref> There is also a belief, because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, that infibulation increases hygiene.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/4005473 Gruenbaum 2005], p.&nbsp;437.</ref> Women regularly introduce substances into the vagina to [[Dry sex|reduce lubrication]], including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and Vicks menthol rub, a practice the WHO includes within Type IV FGM; the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increased risk of infection.<ref>Bagnol and Mariano 2011, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&pg=PA277 277<U+2013>281]; for Type IV, [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], pp.&nbsp;27<U+2013>28.</ref>

Common reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;67.</ref> In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 558 (17.4 percent) of 3,210 women opposed FGM, and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy.<ref>Asma El Dareer, [http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/2/138.abstract "Attitudes of Sudanese People to the Practice of Female Circumcision"], ''International Journal of Epidemiology'', 12(2), 1983 (pp.&nbsp;138<U+2013>144), p.&nbsp;140. {{PMID|6874206}} {{doi|10.1093/ije/12.2.138}}</ref> Attitudes are slowly changing; 48 percent of women in Sudan in 2010 who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;90.</ref> In surveys in 2010<U+2013>2011, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq and Yemen most said it should end, though in several countries only by a narrow margin.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp.&nbsp;52<U+2013>54: "The highest levels of support can be found in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt, where more than half the female population think the practice should continue" (p.&nbsp;52).

===Social obligation===
[[File:Molly Melching, Tostan, 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=photograph|[[Molly Melching]] in 2007 on the 10th anniversary of the abandonment of FGM by [[Malicounda Bambara]], Senegal]]

Against the argument that women willingly choose FGM for their daughters, UNICEF calls the practice a "self-enforcing social convention" to which families feel they must conform to avoid uncut daughters facing social exclusion.<ref name=UNICEF20123p15>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;15.</ref>

[[Ellen Gruenbaum]] reports that, in the 1970s, cut girls from an Arab ethnic group in Sudan would mock uncut girls from the [[Zarma people|Zabarma people]], shouting at them ''Ya, Ghalfa!'' ("Hey, unclean!"). The Zabarma girls would respond with their own taunt, ''Ya, mutmura!'' (a ''mutmara'' was a storage pit for grain that was continually opened and closed, like an infibulated woman). But the Zabarma girls felt the pressure, asking their mothers, "What's the matter? Don't we have razor blades like the Arabs?"<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/4005473 Gruenbaum 2005], pp.&nbsp;432<U+2013>433.</ref>

Because of poor access to information, and because circumcisers downplay the causal connection, women may not associate the health consequences with the procedure. Lala Bald<U+00E9>, president of a women's association in Medina Cherif, a village in Senegal, told Mackie in 1998 that when girls fell ill or died, it was attributed to evil spirits. When informed of the causal relationship, Mackie writes, the women broke down and wept. He argues that surveys taken before and after this sharing of information would show very different levels of support for FGM.<ref>[http://polisci2.ucsd.edu/gmackie/documents/FGCHarmlessPractice.pdf Mackie 2003], pp.&nbsp;147<U+2013>148.</ref>

Mackie has worked with UNICEF to develop programmes in which whole villages pledge to leave their daughters uncut and allow their sons to marry uncut girls.<ref>[https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2013/UNICEF-UNFPA%20Joint%20Programme%20AR_final_v14.pdf UNFPA<U+2013>UNICEF 2012], p.&nbsp;18.<p>

Surveys have shown a widespread belief, particularly in Mali, Eritrea, Mauritania, Guinea and Egypt, that FGM is a religious requirement.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp.&nbsp;69<U+2013>70; Figure 6.12, p.&nbsp;71.</ref> Gerry Mackie and John LeJeune write that practitioners may not distinguish between religion, tradition and chastity, making it difficult to interpret the data.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131014151512/http://www.polisci.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/UNICEF.pdf Mackie and LeJeune 2008], p.&nbsp;8.</ref> As part of UNFPA<U+2013>UNICEF's joint programme, 20,941 religious and traditional leaders made public declarations between 2008 and 2013 delinking their religions from the practice, and religious leaders issued 2,898 edicts against it.<ref name=jointprogrammeevaluationp26>[https://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2014/Joint%20Programme%20on%20FGMC%20Summary%20Report.pdf ''UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change], Summary Report of Phase I, 2008<U+2013>2013'' (hereafter 2013 UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme evaluation), p.&nbsp;26.</ref>

Mackie writes that FGM is found "only in or adjacent to" Islamic groups. There is no mention of it in the [[Quran]]. It is praised in several ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings attributed to Muhammad) as noble but not required, along with advice that the milder forms are kinder to women. Although its origins are pre-Islamic, FGM became associated with Islam because of that religion's focus on female chastity and seclusion.<ref>[http://pages.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf Mackie 1996], pp.&nbsp;1004<U+2013>1005: "FGM is found only in or adjacent to Islamic groups (some neighboring Christians practice it to avoid damnation)&nbsp;... The Koran is silent on FGM, but several ''hadith'' (sayings attributed to Mohammed) recommend attenuating the practice for the woman's sake, praise it as noble but not commanded, or advise that female converts refrain from mutilation because even if pleasing to the husband it is painful to the wife."<p>
[http://pages.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf Mackie 1996], p.&nbsp;1008: "FGM is pre-Islamic but was exaggerated by its intersection with the Islamic modesty code of family honor, female purity, virginity, chastity, fidelity, and seclusion."<p>

It's prohibited, prohibited, prohibited," Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa said on the privately owned al-Mahwar network."</ref>

FGM is also practised by [[Animism|animist]] groups, particularly in Guinea and Mali, and by Christians.<ref>For animist groups, [http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&nbsp;175; for Christians, p.&nbsp;73.</ref> In Niger, for example, 55 percent of Christian women and girls have experienced FGM, compared with two percent of their Muslim counterparts.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], front page: "Niger. 55% of Christian girls and women have undergone FGM/C, compared to 2% of Muslim girls and women," and p.&nbsp;73.</ref> There is no mention of FGM in the [[Bible]], and Christian missionaries in Africa were [[#Colonial opposition in Kenya|among the first]] to object to it.<ref>Samuel Waje Kunhiyop, ''African Christian Ethics'', Zondervan, 2008, p.&nbsp;297: "Nowhere in all of Scripture or in any of recorded church history is there even a hint that women were to be circumcised."<p>

Historian Mary Knight writes that there may be a reference to an uncircumcised girl ('''m't''), written in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s, in what is known as Spell 1117 of the [[Coffin Texts]]:

The spell was found on the [[sarcophagus]] of Sit-hedjhotep, now in the [[Egyptian Museum]], and dates to Egypt's [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], c.&nbsp;1991<U+2013>1786&nbsp;BCE. (Paul F. O'Rourke argues that '''m't'' probably refers instead to a menstruating woman.)<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p.&nbsp;330. Knight adds that Egyptologists are uncomfortable with the translation to ''uncircumcised'', because there is no information about what constituted the circumcised state.<p>

Sometime after this, Nephoris [Tathemis's mother] defrauded me, being anxious that it was time for Tathemis to be circumcised, as is the custom among the Egyptians.

The examination of [[Mummy|mummies]] has shown no evidence of FGM. Citing the Australian pathologist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], who examined hundreds of mummies in the early 20th century, Knight writes that the genital area may resemble Type III, because during mummification the skin of the outer labia was pulled toward the anus to cover the [[pudendal cleft]], possibly to prevent sexual violation. It was similarly not possible to determine whether Types I or II had been performed, because soft tissues had been removed by the embalmers or had deteriorated.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p.&nbsp;331, citing G. Elliot Smith, ''A Contribution to the Study of Mummification in Egypt'', 1906, p.&nbsp;30.<p>
Knight quotes [[Marc Armand Ruffer]], ''Studies in the Paleopathology of Egypt'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1921, p.&nbsp;171: "[T]he bodies are in such a state that it would often be difficult to state with certainty whether such an operation had been done." Knight adds: "In light of the fact that only rarely have scientific researchers autopsying mummies specifically looked for the presence or absence of FGM, conclusive remarks about the prevalence of the practice must await a detailed study of a large cohort of female mummies."</ref>

Strabo, ''Geography of Strabo'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17B*.html#ref273 Book VII, chapter 2], 17.2.5, wrote: "One of the customs most zealously observed among the Aegyptians is this, that they rear every child that is born, and circumcise [<U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03AD><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>, ''peritemnein''] the males, and excise [''ektemnein''] the females, as is also customary among the Jews, who are also Aegyptians in origin, as I have already stated in my account of them" (Cohen 2005, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PmL-LogqJ-YC&pg=PA59 59ff], argues that Strabo conflated the Jews with the Egyptians).<p>
[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16D*.html Book XVI, chapter 4], 16.4.9: "And then to the Harbour of Antiphilus, and, above this, to the Creophagi [meat-eaters], of whom the males have their sexual glands mutilated [''kolobos''] and the women are excised [''ektemnein''] in the Jewish fashion."<p>
[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p.&nbsp;326, writes that there is one extant reference from antiquity, from [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus of Lydia]] in the fifth century BCE, that may allude to FGM outside Egypt. Xanthus wrote, in a history of [[Lydia]]: "The Lydians arrived at such a state of delicacy that they were even the first to 'castrate' their women." Knight argues that the "castration," which is not described, may have kept women youthful, in the sense of allowing the Lydian king to have intercourse with them without pregnancy. Knight concludes that it may have been a reference to sterilization, not FGM.</ref>}}

The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (c. 64 BCE <U+2013> c. 23 CE) wrote about FGM after visiting Egypt around 25 BCE ''(right)''.<ref name=Strabo/> The philosopher [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE <U+2013> 50 CE) also made reference to it: "the Egyptians by the custom of their country circumcise the marriageable youth and maid in the fourteenth (year) of their age, when the male begins to get seed, and the female to have a menstrual flow."<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p.&nbsp;333.</ref> It is mentioned briefly in a work attributed to the Greek physician [[Galen]] (129 <U+2013> c. 200 CE): "When [the clitoris] sticks out to a great extent in their young women, Egyptians consider it appropriate to cut it out."<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p.&nbsp;326 (Knight writes that the attribution to Galen is suspect).</ref>

Another Greek physician, [[A<U+00EB>tius of Amida]] (mid-5th to mid-6th century CE), offered more detail in book 16 of his ''Sixteen Books on Medicine'', citing the physician Philomenes. The procedure was performed in case the clitoris, or ''nymph<U+00EA>'', grew too large or triggered sexual desire when rubbing against clothing. "On this account, it seemed proper to the Egyptians to remove it before it became greatly enlarged," A<U+00EB>tius wrote, "especially at that time when the girls were about to be married":

<div style="background-color:none;margin-right:8em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 10px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify">
The surgery is performed in this way: Have the girl sit on a chair while a muscled young man standing behind her places his arms below the girl's thighs. Have him separate and steady her legs and whole body. Standing in front and taking hold of the clitoris with a broad-mouthed forceps in his left hand, the surgeon stretches it outward, while with the right hand, he cuts it off at the point next to the pincers of the forceps.

It is proper to let a length remain from that cut off, about the size of the membrane that's between the nostrils, so as to take away the excess material only; as I have said, the part to be removed is at that point just above the pincers of the forceps. Because the clitoris is a skinlike structure and stretches out excessively, do not cut off too much, as a urinary fistula may result from cutting such large growths too deeply.<ref name=Knight2001p327>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], pp.&nbsp;327<U+2013>328 (a paragraph break has been added for ease of reading).</ref></div>

The genital area was then cleaned with a sponge, [[frankincense]] powder and wine or cold water, and wrapped in linen bandages dipped in vinegar, until the seventh day when [[calamine]], rose petals, date pits or a "genital powder made from baked clay" might be applied.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3080631 Knight 2001], p.&nbsp;328.</ref>

Whatever the practice's origins, infibulation became linked to slavery. Mackie cites the Portuguese missionary [[Jo<U+00E3>o dos Santos]], who in 1609 wrote of a group inland from Mogadishu who had a "custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them." The English explorer [[William George Browne|William Browne]] wrote in 1799 that the Egyptians practised excision, and that slaves in that country were infibulated to prevent pregnancy.<ref>[http://pages.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf Mackie 1996], p.&nbsp;1003.</ref> Thus, Mackie argues, a "practice associated with shameful female slavery came to stand for honor."<ref>[http://pages.ucsd.edu/~gmackie/documents/MackieASR.pdf Mackie 1996], p.&nbsp;1009.</ref>

[[Isaac Baker Brown]], an English gynaecologist, president of the [[Medical Society of London]], and co-founder in 1845 of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St. Mary's Hospital]] in London, believed that masturbation, or "unnatural irritation" of the clitoris, caused peripheral excitement of the pubic nerve, which led to hysteria, spinal irritation, fits, idiocy, mania and death.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9326757 Elchalal, et al, 1997]; [[Peter Lewis Allen]], ''The Wages of Sin: Sex and Disease, Past and Present'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=SpQOUx5zoBEC&pg=PA106 106].</ref> He therefore "set to work to remove the clitoris whenever he had the opportunity of doing so," according to his obituary in the ''Medical Times and Gazette'' in 1873.<ref>J.

{{further|Female circumcision controversy (Kenya, 1929<U+2013>1932)}}
Protestant missionaries in [[East Africa Protectorate|British East Africa]] (present-day Kenya), began campaigning against FGM in the early 20th century when Dr. [[John Arthur]] joined the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) in Kikuyu. The practice was known by the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the country's main ethnic group, as ''irua'' for both girls and boys, and involved excision (Type II) for girls and removal of the foreskin for boys. It was an important ethnic marker, and unexcised Kikuyu women, known as ''irugu'', were outcasts.<ref>Lynn M. Thomas,{{" '}}Ngaitana (I will circumcise myself)': Lessons from Colonial Campaigns to Ban Excision in Meru, Kenya" in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund, 2000, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&pg=PA132 132].<p>

[[Jomo Kenyatta]], general secretary of the Kikuyu Central Association and Kenya's first prime minister from 1963, wrote in 1938 that, for the Kikuyu, the institution of FGM was the "''conditio sine qua non'' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality." No proper Kikuyu man or woman would marry or have sexual relations with someone who was not circumcised. A woman's responsibilities toward the tribe began with her initiation; her age and place within tribal history was traced to that day, and the group of girls with whom she was cut was named according to current events, an [[oral tradition]] that allowed the Kikuyu to track people and events going back hundreds of years.<ref>Kenyatta 1962 [1938], pp.&nbsp;127<U+2013>130.</ref>

From 1925, beginning with the CSM mission, several missionary churches declared that FGM was prohibited for African Christians. The CSM announced that Africans practising it would be excommunicated, resulting in hundreds leaving or being expelled.<ref>Klaus Fiedler, ''Christianity and African Culture'', Leiden: Brill, 1996, p.&nbsp;75.</ref> The stand-off turned FGM into a focal point of the Kenyan independence movement; the 1929<U+2013>1931 period is known in the country's historiography as the [[Female circumcision controversy (Kenya, 1929<U+2013>1932)|female circumcision controversy]].<ref>Boddy 2007, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&pg=PA241 241<U+2013>245].<p>

In 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council began referring to FGM as the "sexual mutilation of women," rather than circumcision, and a person's stance toward the practice became a test of loyalty, either to the Christian churches or the [[Kikuyu Central Association]].<ref>Thomas 2000, p.&nbsp;132; for the "sexual mutilation of women," Karanja 2009, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&pg=PA93 93], n.&nbsp;631.<p>

In 1956 the council of male elders (the ''Njuri Nchecke'') in Meru announced a ban on FGM. Over the next three years, as a symbol of defiance, thousands of girls cut each other's genitals with razor blades. The movement came to be known in [[Meru language|Meru]] as ''Ngaitana'' ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas describes the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.<ref>Thomas 2000, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&pg=PA129 129<U+2013>131] (p.&nbsp;131 for the girls as "central actors"); Lynn Thomas, ''Politics of the Womb: Women, Reproduction, and the State in Kenya'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003, pp.&nbsp;89<U+2013>91.<p>

FGM is still practised in Sudan; some states banned it in 2008<U+2013>2009, but as of 2013 there was no national legislation ([http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp.&nbsp;2, 9).</ref> The Egyptian government banned infibulation in state-run hospitals in 1959, but allowed partial clitoridectomy if parents requested it.<ref>Elizabeth Heger Boyle, ''Female Genital Cutting: Cultural Conflict in the Global Community'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002, pp.&nbsp;92, 103.</ref> The UN asked the WHO to investigate FGM that year, but the latter responded that it was not a medical issue.<ref>Boyle 2002, p.&nbsp;41.</ref>

{{FGM opposition timeline}}

In 1975 the American social scientist Rose Oldfield Hayes became the first female academic to publish a detailed account of FGM, aided by her ability to discuss the issues directly with women in Sudan. Her article in ''American Ethnologist'' called it "female genital mutilation," and brought it to wider academic attention.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/643328 Hayes 1975], p.&nbsp;618; Gruenbaum 2001, p.&nbsp;21.</ref> Four years later Austrian-American feminist [[Fran Hosken]] published ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females'' (1979), the first to estimate the global number of women cut. She wrote that 110,529,000 women in 20 African countries had experienced FGM.<ref>[http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/WP39/WP39.pdf Yoder and Khan 2008], p.&nbsp;2.</ref> The figures were speculative, but in several instances consistent with later surveys; Mackie writes that her work was "more informative than the silence that preceded her efforts."<ref>[http://polisci2.ucsd.edu/gmackie/documents/FGCHarmlessPractice.pdf Mackie 2003], p.&nbsp;139.</ref> Describing FGM as a "training ground for male violence," Hosken accused female practitioners of "participating in the destruction of their own kind."<ref>Hosken 1994 [1979], p.&nbsp;5.</ref> The language caused a rift between Western and African feminists; African women boycotted a session featuring Hosken during the UN's Mid-Decade Conference on Women in Copenhagen in July 1980.<ref>Boyle 2002, p.&nbsp;47; Bagnol and Mariano 2011, p.&nbsp;281.</ref>

The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, founded after a seminar in Dakar, Senegal, in 1984, called for an end to the practice, as did the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna in June 1993. The conference listed FGM as a form of violence against women, marking it as a human-rights violation, rather than a medical issue.<ref>[[Anika Rahman]] and [[Nahid Toubia]], ''Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Laws and Policies Worldwide'', New York: Zed Books, 2000, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=kEG6GaudxQEC&pg=PA110 10<U+2013>11]; for Vienna, also see [http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013] p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Throughout the 1990s and 2000s African governments banned or restricted it.

Egypt finally outlawed FGM in 2008 after at least two partial bans. Two incidents had attracted international attention. In 1994 CNN broadcast images of a child undergoing FGM in a barber's shop in Cairo, and in 2007 a child died during an FGM procedure. The death prompted the Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research, the country's highest religious authority, to rule that FGM had no basis in Islamic law, and the government banned it in July 2007 by ministerial decree. Conducting FGM was added as a criminal offence to the country's penal code in June 2008.<ref>For CNN, Salam 1999, p.&nbsp;322.<p>

==Criticism of opposition==
===Tolerance versus human rights===
Anthropologist [[Eric Silverman]] wrote in 2004 that FGM had "emerged as one of the central moral topics of contemporary anthropology." Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of cultural colonialism; in turn, the former have been criticized for their moral relativism and failure to defend the idea of universal human rights.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/25064860 Silverman 2004], pp.&nbsp;420 (for the quote), 427.</ref> According to the opposition's critics, the biological reductionism of the opposition, and the failure to appreciate the practice's cultural context, undermines the practitioners' agency and serves to "other" them&nbsp;<U+2013> in particular by calling African parents mutilators.<ref>Vicky Kirby, "Out of Africa: 'Our Bodies Ourselves?'" in Obioma Nnaemeka (ed.), ''Female Circumcision and the Politics of Knowledge: African Women in Imperialist Discourses'', Westport: Praeger, 2005, p.&nbsp;83.</ref> Yet Africans who object to the opposition risk appearing to defend FGM.<ref>Obioma Nnaemeka, "African Women, Colonial Discourses, and Imperialist Interventions: Female Circumcision as Impetus," in Nnaemeka 2005, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&pg=PA33 33].</ref> Feminist theorist Obioma Nnaemeka&nbsp;<U+2013> herself strongly opposed to FGM ("If one is circumcised, it is one too many")&nbsp;<U+2013> argues that the impact of renaming it ''female genital mutilation'' cannot be underestimated:

[[File:Obioma Nnaemeka (cropped) 2.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph|Obioma Nnaemeka: "Westerners are quick to appropriate the power to name, while remaining totally oblivious of and/or insensitive to the implications and consequences of the naming."<ref>Nnaemeka 2005, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&pg=PA34 34].</ref>]]

<div style="background-color:none;margin-right:8em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 10px #ccc;padding:1.5em;text-align:justify">
In this name game, although the discussion is about African women, a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging the barbarism marks another era where colonialism and missionary zeal determined what "civilization" was, and figured out how and when to force it on people who did not ask for it.<ref>Nnaemeka 2005, p.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&pg=PA34 34]; p.&nbsp;35 for "If one is circumcised, it is one too many."</ref></div>

Ugandan law professor [[Sylvia Tamale]] argues that early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices&nbsp;<U+2013> including [[dry sex]], [[polygyny]], [[bride price]] and [[levirate marriage]]&nbsp;<U+2013> were primitive and required correction.<ref name=Tamale2011pp19-20>Tamale 2011, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&pg=PA19 19<U+2013>20].</ref> African feminists "do not condone the negative aspects of the practice," writes Tamale, but "take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women."<ref name=Tamale2011pp19-20/>

The debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for all women. Anthropologist Christine Walley writes that a common trope within the anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of [[false consciousness]] participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by several feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, [[Mary Daly]] and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein. It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that "a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism."<ref>Christine J. Walley, "Searching for 'Voices': Feminism, Anthropology, and the Global Over Female Genital Operations" in James and Robertson 2002, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&pg=PA18 18], [http://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&pg=PA34 34] (for false consciousness), 43.<p>

As an example of the disrespect arguably shown toward women who have undergone FGM, commentators highlight the appropriation of the women's bodies as exhibits. Historian Chima Korieh cites the publication in 1996 of the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography|Pulitzer-prize-winning]] photographs ''([[#Pulitzer|above]])'' of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl undergoing FGM. The photographs were published by 12 American newspapers, but according to Korieh the girl had not given permission for the images to be taken, much less published.<ref>Chima Korieh, {{" '}}Other' Bodies: Western Feminism, Race and Representation in Female Circumcision Discourse," in Nnaemeka 2005, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&pg=PA121 121<U+2013>122].<p>

Whether FGM is invariably harmful is also disputed. Anthropologist [[Richard Shweder]] argues that the medical evidence does not support that it is; he cites reviews of the medical literature by epidemiologist [[Carla Obermeyer]], who suggested in 1999 and 2005 that serious complications were the exception.<ref>[[Richard Shweder]], [https://humdev.sites.uchicago.edu/sites/humdev.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shweder/When%20Cultures%20Collide.pdf "When Cultures Collide: Which Rights?

===Comparison with other procedures{{anchor|comparison}}===
Obioma Nnaemeka argues that the crucial question, broader than FGM, is why the female body is subjected to so much "abuse and indignity" around the world, including in the West.<ref>Nnaemeka 2005, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&pg=PA38 38<U+2013>39].</ref> Several authors have drawn a parallel between FGM and cosmetic procedures.<ref name=Johnsdotter2010p32>Sara Johnsdotter and Birgitta Ess<U+00E9>n, [http://www.iscgmedia.com/uploads/6/0/9/7/6097060/johnsdotter_cvs.pdf "Genitals and ethnicity: the politics of genital modifications"], ''Reproductive Health Matters'', 18(35), 2010 (pp.&nbsp;29<U+2013>37), p.&nbsp;32. {{PMID|20541081}} {{doi|10.1016/S0968-8080(10)35495-4}}<p>

[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|270px|alt=photograph|[[Martha Nussbaum]] argues that a key moral and legal issue with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force.]]

Carla Obermeyer maintains that FGM may be conducive to women's well-being within their communities in the same way that [[rhinoplasty]] and male circumcision may help people elsewhere.<ref>[http://csde.washington.edu/fogarty/casestudies/shellduncanmaterials/day%202/Obermeyer,%20C.%20%281999%29%20Female%20genital%20surgeries.pdf Obermeyer 1999], p.&nbsp;94.</ref> In Egypt, despite the 2008 ban, women wanting FGM for their daughters discuss the need for ''amalyet tajmeel'' (cosmetic surgery) to remove what is viewed as excess genital tissue for a more acceptable appearance.<ref>[http://timep.org/commentary/midwives-doctors-searching-safer-circumcisions-egypt# Rahim (Tahrir Institute) 2014].</ref>

The WHO does not cite procedures such as [[labiaplasty]] and [[clitoral hood reduction]] as examples of FGM, but its definition aims to avoid loopholes, so several elective practices do fall within its categories.<ref name=WHOelective>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596442_eng.pdf WHO 2008], p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Some of the laws banning FGM would seem to cover cosmetic procedures. Sweden, for example, has banned operations "on the external female genital organs which are designed to mutilate them or produce other permanent changes in them" regardless of consent.<ref>[http://www.iscgmedia.com/uploads/6/0/9/7/6097060/johnsdotter_cvs.pdf Johnsdotter and Ess<U+00E9>n 2010], p.&nbsp;32.</ref> Gynaecologist Birgitta Ess<U+00E9>n and anthropologist Sara Johnsdotter note that it seems the law distinguishes between Western and African genitals, and deems only African women (such as those seeking reinfibulation after childbirth) unfit to make their own decisions.<ref>[http://www.iscgmedia.com/uploads/6/0/9/7/6097060/johnsdotter_cvs.pdf Johnsdotter and Ess<U+00E9>n 2010], p.&nbsp;33; [http://web.archive.org/web/20130414232252/http://www.hmb.utoronto.ca/HMB303H/Case_Studies/Kenya-FGM/FGM_%26_Cosmetic_Surgery.pdf Ess<U+00E9>n and Johnsdotter 2004], p.&nbsp;613.</ref>

Arguing against suggested similarities between FGM and dieting or body shaping, philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] writes that a key difference is that FGM is mostly conducted on children using physical force. She argues that the distinction between social pressure and physical force is morally and legally salient, comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape. She argues further that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than in the Western world, and that this reduces their ability to make informed choices.<ref>Nussbaum 1999, pp.&nbsp;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oC&pg=PA123 123<U+2013>124].<p>

Several commentators maintain that children's rights are violated with the genital alteration of [[intersex]] children, who are born with anomalies that physicians choose to correct. Legal scholars Nancy Ehrenreich and Mark Barr write that thousands of these procedures take place every year in the United States, and say that they are medically unnecessary, more extensive than FGM, and have more serious physical and mental consequences. They attribute the silence of anti-FGM campaigners about intersex procedures to white privilege and a refusal to acknowledge that "similar unnecessary and harmful genital cutting occurs in their own backyards."<ref>Nancy Ehrenreich, Mark Barr, [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/crcl/vol40_1/ehrenreich.pdf "Intersex Surgery, Female Genital Cutting, and the Selective Condemnation of 'Cultural Practices{{' "}}], ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'', 40(1), 2005 (pp.&nbsp;71<U+2013>140), pp.&nbsp;74<U+2013>75.<p>
