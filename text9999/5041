==History of the Church==
St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church of Los Angeles was founded as the second Coptic parish in the United States, and was incorporated by 1970 with only 200 families at the time.<ref name="Data">[http://nacopts.com/viewChurch.php?id=42 Church Data]</ref> The Coptic families in Los Angeles started settling from around the late 60's when the late [[Bishoy Kamel|Father Bishoy Kamel]] was commissioned to serve the church in 1969,<ref>[http://www.stmark.toronto.on.coptorthodox.ca/copts.asp The History of Copts in North America] (Retrieved 08-06-2008)</ref> during [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI's]] papacy. Fr. Bishoy was a promiment Copt, being considered a modern-day saint within the Church. As a matter of fact, Fr. Bishoy Kamel helped found St. Mark's Church in LA, as well as several other parishes and buildings throughout Egypt, the United States, Europe and Australia.<ref>[http://www.stabanoub-dallas.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=94:fr-bishoy-kamel&catid=42:Cop_Saints_cat&Itemid=55 The life of Fr. Bishoy Kamel] (Retrieved 06-08-2008)</ref>

The congregation initially used a Syriac Orthodox building to accommodate for liturgies. Then, the congregation eventually purchased the current building which was previously used by the Russian Orthodox.<ref>[http://www.coptic.net/synexarion/FatherBishoyKamel.txt Fr. Bishoy Kamel] (Retrieved 06-08-2008)</ref> Several years later, in 1995, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States#Diocese of Los Angeles, Southern California and Hawaii|Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Los Angeles, Southern California and Hawaii]] was founded. [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|HH Pope Shenouda III]], the current [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]], enthroned [[Bishop Serapion|HG Serapion]] as Bishop for the diocese, which includes St. Mark's Church as well as several other [[List of Coptic Orthodox Churches in the United States#Diocese of LA|diocese churches]].
