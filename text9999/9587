'''Henry Ossawa Tanner''' (June 21, 1859 &ndash; May 25, 1937) was an African-American artist. He was the first [[African American art|African-American painter]] to gain international acclaim.<ref name =WhiteHouse>{{cite web | url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/hot-bio.html | title=Henry Ossawa Tanner | accessdate=August 5, 2006}}</ref> He moved to Paris in 1891 to study, and decided to stay there, being readily accepted in French artistic circles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: American Artist|author=Marcia M. Mathews|year= 1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-51006-9}}</ref> His painting entitled ''Daniel in the Lions Den'' was accepted into the 1896 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].<ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/>

After teaching himself some art, he had enrolled as a young man in 1879 at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia. He was the only black student and became a favorite of the painter [[Thomas Eakins]], who had recently started teaching there. He also made other connections among artists, including [[Robert Henri]]. In the late 1890s he was sponsored for a trip to Palestine by [[Rodman Wanamaker]], who was impressed by his paintings of Biblical themes.

==Early life==
Tanner was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father Benjamin Tucker Tanner was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the United States. In addition, he was an editor and political [[activist]]. His mother Sarah Tanner was born into [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] but had escaped to the North via the [[Underground Railroad]]. The family moved to Philadelphia when Tanner was young. There his father became a friend, sometime supporter, sometime critic of [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref name="eoaah" >{{Citation

==Education==

Although many artists refused to accept an African-American apprentice, in 1879 Tanner enrolled  at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia, becoming the only black student.<ref name="eoaah"/> His decision to attend the school came at an exciting time in the history of artistic institutional training.  Art academies had long relied on tired notions of study devoted almost entirely to plaster cast studies and anatomy lectures. This changed drastically with the addition of [[Thomas Eakins]] as <U+201C>Professor of Drawing and Painting<U+201D> to the Pennsylvania Academy. Eakins encouraged new methods such as study from live models, direct discussion of anatomy in male and female classes, and dissections of cadavers to further familiarity and understanding of the human body. Eakins<U+2019>s progressive views and ability to excite and inspire his students would have a profound effect on Tanner. The young artist proved to be one of Eakins<U+2019> favorite students; two decades after Tanner left the Academy  Eakins painted his portrait, making him one of a handful of students to be so honored.<ref name="Parry, Ellwood C. III">Parry, Ellwood C. III. ''Three Nineteenth Century Afro-American Artists.'' Cedar Rapids, IA: Cedar Rapids Art Center, 1980.</ref>

At the Academy Tanner befriended artists with whom he kept in contact throughout the rest of his life, most notably [[Robert Henri]], one of the founders of the [[Ashcan School]]. During a relatively short time at the Academy, Tanner developed a thorough knowledge of anatomy and the skill to express his understanding of the weight and structure of the human figure on the canvas.<ref name="Matthews, Marcia">Matthews, Marcia.''Henry Ossawa Tanner:American Artist''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1969.</ref>

==Issues of racism==
Although he gained confidence as an artist and began to sell his work, he had to deal with [[racism]] in Philadelphia. It had traditionally had strong ties to the South through numerous planter families and commercial ties; in addition, planters had sent their daughters to Philadelphia academies. After the Civil War, many African Americans left the rural South and settled in Northern urban centers, at times coming into conflict with the increasing population of immigrants from Ireland, southern and eastern Europe. Although painting became a therapeutic source of release for Tanner, the lack of acceptance in society was painful.  In his autobiography ''The Story of an Artist<U+2019>s Life'', Tanner describes the burden of racism:

<blockquote>I was extremely timid and to be made to feel that I was not wanted, although in a place where I had every right to be, even months afterwards caused me sometimes weeks of pain.  Every time any one of these disagreeable incidents came into my mind, my heart sank, and I was anew tortured by the thought of what I had endured, almost as much as the incident itself.<ref name="Bruce, Marcus C."/></blockquote>

In an attempt to gain artistic acceptance, Tanner left America for France in late 1891.  Except for occasional brief returns home, he spent the rest of his life there.

==Life abroad==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Arch - Henry Ossawa Tanner - overall.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Ossawa Tanner - ''The Arch'' - [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

After a photography studio in [[Atlanta]] was unsuccessful, Tanner taught drawing at [[Clark Atlanta University]] for a short period.<ref name =Springfield>{{cite web | url=http://www.spfld-museum-of-art.org/collection/tanner.html  | title=Henry Ossawa Tanner | publisher=Springfield Museum of Art |accessdate=August 5, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060110063014/http://www.spfld-museum-of-art.org/collection/tanner.html |archivedate = January 10, 2006}}</ref> In 1891 he traveled to [[Paris]], France to study at the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie Julian]]. He also joined the [[American Art Students Club]] of [[Paris]]. Paris was a welcome escape for Tanner; within French art circles the issue of race mattered little.  Tanner acclimated quickly to Parisian life.

In Paris, Tanner was introduced to many new artists whose works would affect the way in which he painted.  At the [[Louvre]], Tanner encountered and studied the works of [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-Baptiste Chardin]] and [[Louis Le Nain]].<ref name="Shaw, Thomas M.">Shaw, Thomas M. ''What Manner of Men? A Reconsideration across the Synapses of Art History of Three Paintings and their Images of Men of African Descent.''Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1997.</ref> These artists had painted scenes of ordinary people in their environment and the effect in Tanner<U+2019>s work is noticeable.  The influence of Courbet<U+2019>s ''The Stonebreakers'' (1850; Destroyed) can be seen in the similarities painted by Tanner in his ''The Young Sabot Maker'' (1895).  Both paintings explore the theme of apprenticeship and hand labor.<ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/>

He studied under renowned artists such as [[Jean Joseph Benjamin Constant]] and [[Jean-Paul Laurens]].<ref name="Bruce, Marcus C.">Bruce, Marcus C. ''Henry Ossawa Tanner.'' New York: The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2002.</ref> With their guidance, Tanner began to establish a reputation. He settled at the [[<U+00C9>taples art colony]] in Normandy. Earlier Tanner painted marine scenes that showed man<U+2019>s struggle with the sea, but by 1895 he was creating mostly religious works. A transitional work from this period is the recently rediscovered painting of a fishing boat tossed on the waves, which is held by the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].<ref>Details on the [http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=23651 museum site]</ref> This is based on the description of a miracle in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in which 'the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary' (14:24). The simple resources at <U+00C9>taples were well adapted to his subject matter, which in several cases featured Biblical figures in dark interiors.

His painting entitled ''Daniel in the Lions Den'', was accepted into the 1896 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].<ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/>  Later that year he painted ''The Resurrection of Lazarus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://negroartist.com/negro%20artist/Henry%20Ossawa%20Tanner/pages/Henry%20Ossawa%20Tanner%20Daniel%20In%20The%20Lions%20Den_jpg.htm |title=Negro Artist site |publisher=Negroartist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}</ref>  The critical praise for this piece solidified Tanner<U+2019>s position in the artistic elite and heralded the future direction of his paintings, which treated mostly biblical themes. Upon seeing ''The Resurrection of Lazarus'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://negroartist.com/negro%20artist/Henry%20Ossawa%20Tanner/pages/Henry%20Tanner%20The%20Resurrection%20of%20Lazarus%201896_jpg.htm |title=Negro Artist site |publisher=Negroartist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}</ref> art critic [[Rodman Wanamaker]] offered to cover an all expenses-paid trip for Tanner to the Middle East.<ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/>  Wanamaker felt that any serious painter of biblical scenes needed to see the environment firsthand and that a painter of Tanner's caliber was well worth the investment.

Tanner quickly accepted the offer.  Before the next Salon opened, Tanner set forth for Palestine.  Explorations of various mosques and biblical sites as well as character studies of the local population allowed Tanner to further his artistic training.  His paintings developed a powerful air of mystery and spirituality.  Tanner was not the first artist to study the Middle East in person.  Since the 1830s, a growing interest in [[Orientalism]] had been growing in Europe.  Artists such as [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], and later Henri [[Matisse]] made such tours to capitalize on this curiosity.<ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/>

==''The Banjo Lesson''==
[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner - The Banjo Lesson.jpg|thumb|Henry Ossawa Tanner, ''The Banjo Lesson'', 1893. Oil on canvas, 49" <U+00D7> 35<U+00BD>". [[Hampton University]] Museum.]]

In 1893 on a short return visit to the United States, Tanner painted his most famous work, ''The Banjo Lesson,'' while in Philadelphia.  The painting shows an elderly black man teaching a boy, assumed to be his grandson, how to play the banjo.  This deceptively simple-looking work explores several important themes.  Blacks had long been stereotyped as entertainers in American culture, and the image of a black man playing the banjo appears throughout American art of the late 19th century. Thomas Worth,<ref name="Woods, Naurice Frank, Jr., Ph.D.">Woods, Naurice Frank, Jr., Ph.D. ''Insuperable Obstacles: The Impact of the Creative and Personal Development of Four Nineteenth Century African American Artists.'' The Union Institute, 1993.</ref> Willy Miller, Walter M. Dunk, Eastman Johnson, and Tanner<U+2019>s teacher Thomas Eakins had tackled the subject in their artwork.<ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/>

These images are often reduced to a minstrel-type portrayal.  Tanner painted a sensitive reinterpretation. Instead of a generalization, the painting portrays a specific moment of human interaction. The two characters concentrate intently on the task before them. They seem to be oblivious to the rest of the world, which enlarges the sense of real contact and cooperation. The skillfully painted portraits of the individuals make it obvious that these are real people and not types.

In addition to being a meaningful exploration of human qualities, the piece is masterfully painted.  Tanner undertakes the difficult endeavor of portraying two separate and varying light sources.  A natural white, blue glow from outside enters from the left while the warm light from a fireplace is apparent on the right.  The figures are illuminated where the two light sources meet; some have hypothesized this as a manifestation of Tanner<U+2019>s situation in transition between two worlds, his American past and his newfound home in France.<ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/>

==Painting style==
Tanner is often regarded as a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] painter,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/tanner_henry_ossawa.html | title=Henry Ossawa Tanner Online | accessdate=August 5, 2006}}</ref> focusing on accurate depictions of subjects.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/realism.htm | title=Realism - Realism Art | accessdate=August 5, 2006}}</ref> While works such as ''The Banjo Lesson'' were concerned with everyday life as an African American, Tanner later painted themes based on religious subjects, for which he is now best known.<ref name =Springfield /> It is likely that Tanner's father, a minister in the [[African Methodist Episcopal]] Church, was a formative influence for him.<ref name="Matthews, Marcia"/>

[[File:Henry Ossawa Tanner - The Annunciation.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Ossawa Tanner, ''The Annunciation'', 1898. Oil on canvas, 57" <U+00D7> 71<U+00BD>". [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]
Tanner's body of work is not limited to one specific approach to painting.  His works vary from meticulous attention to detail in some paintings to loose, [[expressionism|expressive]] brushstrokes in others.  Often both methods are employed simultaneously.  The combination of these two techniques makes for a masterful balance of skillful precision and powerful expression.  Tanner was also interested in the effects that color could have in a painting.<ref name="Kettlewell, James K.">Kettlewell, James K. ''The Art of Henry Ossawa Tanner.'' Glen Falls, NY: The Hyde Collection, 1975.</ref>  Many of his paintings accentuate a specific area of the color spectrum.  Warmer compositions such as ''The Resurrection of Lazarus''(1896) and ''The Annunciation'' (1898) express the intensity and fire of religious moments, and the elation of transcendence between the divine and humanity.  Other paintings emphasize cooler, blue hues.  Works such as ''The Good Shepherd'' (1903) and ''Return of the Holy Women'' (1904) evoke a feeling of somber religiosity and introspection.  Tanner often experimented with light in a composition.  The source and intensity of light and shadow in his paintings create a physical, almost tangible space and atmosphere while adding emotion and mood to the environment.

==Marriage and family==
In 1899 he married Jessie, a white American woman. They had a son Jesse, who survived Tanner at this death.<ref name="Springfield"/>

==Later years==
During [[World War I]], Tanner worked for the [[Red Cross]] Public Information Department, at which time he also painted images from the front lines of the war.<ref name = esper>{{cite web | url = http://esperstamps.org/aa8.htm | title = Henry Ossawa Tanner | accessdate =August 9, 2006}}</ref> His works featuring African-American troops were rare during the war. In 1923 the French state made him a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] for his work as an artist.

Tanner met with fellow African-American artist [[Palmer Hayden]] in Paris circa 1927. They discussed artistic technique and he gave Hayden advice on interacting with French society.<ref>

Several of Tanner's paintings were purchased by Atlanta art collector [[J. J. Haverty]]. He had founded Haverty Furniture Co. and was instrumental in establishing the [[High Museum of Art]]. Tanner's ''[[:File:Etaples Fisher Folk by Henry Ossawa Tanner, 1923, High Museum of Art.jpg|<U+00C9>taples Fisher Folk]]'' is among several paintings from the Haverty collection now in the High Museum's permanent collection.<ref>http://www.high.org/collections/permanent/default.aspx</ref>

Tanner died peacefully in Paris, France on May 25, 1937.<ref name = esper/>

}}</ref> The early paintings of [[William Edouard Scott]], with whom Tanner studied in France, show the influence of Tanner<U+2019>s technique.<ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/>  In addition, some of [[Norman Rockwell]]<U+2019>s illustrations deal with the same themes and compositions that Tanner pursued.  Rockwell's proposed cover of the ''[[Literary Digest]]'' in 1922, for example, shows an older black man playing the banjo for his grandson.  The light sources are nearly identical to those in Tanner's ''Banjo Lesson.''  A fireplace illuminates the right side of the picture while natural light enters from the left.  Both use similar objects as well such as the clothing, chair, crumpled hat on the floor.<ref name="Shaw, Thomas M."/>

Tanner's ''Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City'' (c. 1885 oil on canvas) hangs in the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]] at the [[White House]]; it is the first painting by an African-American artist to be purchased for the permanent collection of the White House. The painting is a landscape with a "view across the cool gray of a shadowed beach to dunes made pink by the late afternoon sunlight. A low haze over the water partially hides the sun."  It was purchased for $100,000 by the White House Endowment Fund during the [[Bill Clinton]] administration from Dr. Rae Alexander-Minter, grandniece of the artist.<ref>"White House Acquires Tanner Painting" http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/102296.html</ref>
