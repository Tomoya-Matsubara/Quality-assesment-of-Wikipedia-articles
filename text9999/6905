'''Ham''' is a [[processed meat|processed]] [[pork]] foodstuff,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=World Cancer Research Fund|title=Red and processed meats and cancer prevention|url=http://www.wcrf-uk.org/cancer_prevention/recommendations/meat_and_cancer.php}}</ref> which undergoes preservation through [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], or salting.  Ham was traditionally made only from the hind leg of [[swine]], and referred to that specific [[Pork#Cuts|cut of pork]].<ref name=Chambers>"Bacon: Bacon and Ham Curing" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop<U+00E6>dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 2, p. 39.</ref> Ham is made around the world, including a number of regional specialties, although the term now has wider usage and can also be used to refer to meat which has been through a process of re-forming.

The precise nature of meat termed "ham" is controlled, often by statute, in a number of areas, including the United States and European Union, meaning that only products meeting a certain set of criteria can be called ham.  In addition, there are numerous ham products which have specific geographical naming protection, such as [[Prosciutto di Parma]] in Europe, and [[Smithfield ham]] in the US.

Ham is also often colloquially used to mean any sliced (or re-formed) preserved meat, regardless of the animal it is made from, although this is usually qualified with the species of animal as with [[turkey ham]].

==Definition==
Ham has a number of definitions, and its meaning has evolved over time.  Ham was originally the [[cut of pork]] deriving from the hind legs of [[swine]], which was then often preserved through processes such as [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], or [[salt-cured meat|salting]].  Cooked leg of pork is called [[gammon (meat)|gammon]].

Because of the preservation process, ham is a compound foodstuff or ingredient, being made up of the original meat, as well as the remnants of the preserving agent(s), such as salt, but it is still recognised as a food in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Food Standards Agency Scotland|page=31|title=Labelling and Composition of Meat Products: Guidance Notes|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/meatproductguidancescot.pdf}}</ref>

In many countries the term is now protected by statute, with a specific definition.  For instance, in the United States, the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) says that "the word 'ham', without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/9/317.8|title=9 CFR 317.8 - False or misleading labeling or practices generally; specific prohibitions and requirements for labels and containers|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

In addition to the main categories, some processing choices can affect legal labeling. For instance, in the United States, a "smoked" ham must have been smoked by hanging over burning wood chips in a [[smokehouse]] or an atomized spray of liquid smoke such that the product appearance is equivalent; a "[[hickory]]-smoked" ham must have been smoked using only hickory. However, injecting "smoke flavor" is not legal grounds for claiming the ham was "smoked"; these are labeled "smoke flavor added". Hams can only be labelled "honey-cured" if honey was at least 50% of the sweetener used, is at least 3% of the formula, and has a discernible effect on flavor. So-called "lean" and "extra lean" hams must adhere to maximum levels of fat and [[cholesterol]] per 100&nbsp;grams of product.

Ham re-formed from smaller pieces in to a larger block also has to be labelled in many jurisdictions.

== Etymology ==
The word "ham" is derived from the [[Old English]] ''ham'' or ''hom'' meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a Germanic base where it meant "crooked".  It gained the meaning of the leg of an animal around the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Brown, Lesley|publisher=Oxford University press|location=Oxford|year=2007|edition=Sixth|volume=II|page=3611}}</ref>

==History==
The preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with [[Cato the Elder]] writing about the "salting of hams" in his ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' tome around 160 BC.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|volume=1|issue=2-3|date=December 1947|pages=269<U+2013>274|title=The Action of Salts and other Substances Used in the Curing of Bacon and Ham|last=Callow|first=EH|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=766980}}</ref>

There are claims that the Chinese were the first people to mention the production of raw cured ham,<ref name=zeuthen>{{cite book|title=Meat Fermentation Worldwide: History and Principles|last=Zeuthen|first=Peter|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ie2IxsLTqfgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=ham+houghton+1982+chinese&ots=3HOGqfRSQO&sig=6wWgNqagfKZYnUaZhYg6G-0o2dE#v=onepage&q=ham%20houghton%201982%20chinese&f=false}}</ref> whilst [[Larousse Gastronomique]] claims an origin from [[Gaul]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Hamlyn|ISBN=978-0-600-62042-6}}</ref> but it was certainly well established by the Roman period, including an import trade from Gaul mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in his writings.<ref name=zeuthen/>

==Method==
There are several methods for producing ham from raw meat, and this is undertaken to preserve and flavour the meat.  Most ham is safe to eat following preservation, without the need for cooking.

===Dry curing===
Traditional dry cure hams may use only salt as the curative agent, such as with San Daniele or Parma hams, although this is comparatively rare.<ref name=meat>{{cite web|url=http://www.meatsandsausages.com/sausage-making/curing/methods|title=Curing Methods|publisher=Meat and Sausages.com}}</ref>  This process involves cleaning the raw meat, covering it in salt (for about two months for Parma ham) whilst it is gradually pressed <U+2013> draining all the blood.  It is then washed and hung in a dark, temperature-regulated place until dry.  It is then hung to air for another period of time.
[[File:ProsciuttoSeaSalt.JPG|thumb|left|Sea salt being added to raw pork leg as part of a dry cure process]]
The duration of the curing process varies by the type of ham, with Serrano ham curing in 9<U+2013>12 months, Parma hams taking more than 12 months, and Iberian ham taking up to 2 years to reach the desired flavour characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=European Food Research and Technology|year=2001|volume=213|issue=2|pages=83<U+2013>87|title=Dipeptidyl peptidase activities along the processing of Serrano dry-cured ham|first1=Miguel Angel|last1=Sentandreu|first2=Fidel|last2=Toldr<U+00E1>|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002170100355#page-1}}</ref> Dry cured hams, such as the Chinese [[Jinhua ham]] takes approximately 8 to 10 months to complete.<ref name=Zhou>{{Citation|first=G.H. |last=Zhou |first2=G.M. |last2=Zhao |title=Biochemical changes during processing of traditional Jinhua ham |journal=Meat Science |year=2007 |pages=114<U+2013>120|issue=77}}</ref>

Most modern dry cure hams also use [[nitrite]]s (either [[sodium nitrite|sodium]] or [[potassium nitrate|potassium]]), which are added along with the salt, although following a similar methodology.  The nitrites deliver a distinctive pink or red tinge to the meat, as well as imparting flavour.  The amount and mixture of salt and nitrites used has an effect on the shrinkage of the meat.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Food Science|title=Effect of salt, phosphates and other curing ingredients on shrinkage of lean pork meat and quality of smoked processed ham|first1=Eugen|last1=Wierbicki|first2=John J|last2=Howker|year=1976|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1116<U+2013>1121|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1976.tb14399.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1976.tb14399.x}}</ref>

[[Sodium nitrite]] is used because it prevents bacterial growth and, in a reaction with the meat's [[myoglobin]], gives the product a desirable dark red color. Because of the toxicity of nitrite (the lethal dose of nitrite for humans is about 22&nbsp;mg per kg body weight), some areas specify a maximum allowable content of nitrite in the final product.  Under certain conditions, especially during cooking, nitrites in meat can react with degradation products of [[amino acid]]s, forming [[nitrosamine]]s, which are known [[carcinogen]]s.<ref>{{cite PMID|16865769}}</ref>

The dry curing of ham involves a number of biochemical reactions caused by [[enzyme]]s.  The enzymes involved are [[proteinase]]s  ([[cathepsin]]s <U+2013> [[Cathepsin B|B]], [[Cathepsin D|D]], [[Cathepsin H|H]] & [[Cathepsin L1|L]], and [[calpain]]s) and [[exopeptidase]]s ([[peptidase]] and [[aminopeptidase]]).<ref name=toldra>{{cite journal|last1=Toldr<U+00E1>|first1=Fidel|last2=Flores|first2=M<U+00F3>nica|title=The Role of Muscle Proteases and Lipases in Flavor Development During the Processing of Dry-Cured Ham|journal=Critical Reviews in Food SCience and Nutrition|year=1998|volume=38|issue=4|pages=351<U+2013>352|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408699891274237#.UlauaVNr2BI|doi=10.1080/10408699891274237}}</ref>

The enzymes cause an intense [[proteolysis]] in the muscle tissue, which creates large numbers of small [[peptide]]s and free [[amino acid]]s, whilst the muscle and [[adipose]] tissue lipids undergo [[lipolysis]] and create free fatty acids.<ref name=toldra/>

The salt in the curing process acts as a strong inhibitor of [[proteolysis|proteolytic activity]], and phosphates also have an effect on reducing this activity.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Meat Science|title=Effect of curing salt and phosphate on the activity of porcine muscle proteases|year=1989|volume=24|issue=4|pages=241<U+2013>249|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0309174089900429|last1=S<U+00E1>rraga|first1=Carmen|last2=Gil|first2=Marta|first3=Jacint|last3=Arnau|first4=Josep M|last4=Monfort|doi=10.1016/0309-1740(89)90042-9}}</ref>

The properties of the raw meat influence the effect of the enzymes; with factors including age and weight of the pig as well as breeding affecting the process.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Carmen|last1=S<U+00E1>rraga|first2=Marta|last2=Gil|first3=Jos<U+00E9> Antonio|last3=Garc<U+00ED>a-Regueiro|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|title=Comparison of calpain and cathepsin (B,L and D) activities during dry-cured ham processing from heavy and large white pigs|volume=62|issue=1|pages=71<U+2013>75|date=Sep 2006}}</ref>  During the process itself, conditions such as temperature, time, water activity, [[redox potential]] and salt content all have an effect.<ref name=toldra/>

The salt content in dry-cured ham varies through the piece of meat, with gradients determinable through dissection and testing, or non-invasively through [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]].<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Meat Science|title=Salt distribution in dry-cured ham measured by computed tomography and image analysis|last1=Vestergaard|first1=Christian|first2=S<U+00F8>ren G|last2=Erbou|first3=Torunn|last3=Thauland|first4=Jens|last4=Adler-Nissen|first5=Per|last5=Berg|volume=69|issue=1|date=January 2005|pages=9<U+2013>15}}</ref>

===Wet curing===
Wet curing involves the immersion of the meat in a [[brine]], sometimes with other ingredients such as sugar also added for flavour.  Meat is submerged in the brine for around 3<U+2013>14 days, during which time the meat needs to be kept submerged, and the brine mixture agitated periodically to prevent separation of the ingredients.<ref name=meat/>

Wet curing also has the effect of increasing volume and weight of the finished product, by about 4%.

The wet curing process can also be replicated by using mechanical pumping using needles and curing solution.  This can be quicker, increase the weight of the finished product by more than immersion wet curing, and ensure a more even distribution of salt through the meat.  This process is quicker than traditional wet cure, normally being completed between a few days and a few weeks.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Applied Microbiology|date=September 1958|title=The occurrence and significance of a motile microorganism of the Genus Lactobacillus in ham curing brines|last1=Deibel|first1=RH|last2=Niven|first2=CF|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1057423/?page=1|volume=5|issue=5|pages=323<U+2013>327|pmc=1057423}}</ref>

=== Smoking ===
{{see also|Smoking (cooking)}}
Ham can also be preserved through the smoking method, where it is placed in a smokehouse (or equivalent) to be cured by the action of smoke.

The main flavor compounds of smoked ham are [[guaiacol]], and its 4-, 5-, and 6-methyl derivatives as well as 2,6-dimethylphenol. These compounds are produced by thermal breakdown (i.e., combustion) of lignin, a major constituent of  wood used in the smokehouse.<ref>Wittkowski, Reiner; Ruther, Joachim; Drinda, Heike; Rafiei-Taghanaki, Foroozan "Formation of smoke flavor compounds by thermal lignin degradation" ACS Symposium Series (Flavor Precursors), 1992, volume 490, pp 232<U+2013>243. ISBN 9780841222229</ref>

==Protected designations==

[[File:Jam<U+00F3>n de Guijuelo 003.JPG|thumb|right|Spanish Jam<U+00F3>n de Guijuelo, a protected designation ham]]
There are a wide number of hams worldwide which have some level of protection of their unique characteristics, usually relating to their method of preservation and/or location of production or processing.  Dependent on jurisdiction, rules may prevent any other product being sold with the particular appellation, such as through the [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|European protected geographical indication]].

== Uses ==
Ham is typically used in its sliced form, often as a filling for sandwiches and similar foods, such as in the [[ham sandwich]] and [[ham and cheese sandwich]].  Other variations include toasted sandwiches such as the [[croque-monsieur]].

It is also used chopped in a wide range of dishes, such as omelettes.

Preserved ham can be cooked (although there is no requirement), and usually requires washing in water to remove salt.  Whole fresh pork leg is also served cooked as [[gammon (meat)|gammon]], known as ham in the United States.

==Health effects==
As a processed meat, there has been concern over the health effects of ham consumption.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Processed meat 'early death' link|last=Gallagher|first=James|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21682779}}</ref>  A meta-analysis study has shown a statistically relevant correlation between processed meat consumption and the risk of [[pancreatic cancer]], with an increase in consumption of {{convert|50|g|oz}} per day leading to a 19% increase in risk.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Cancer|year=2012|volume=106|pages=603<U+2013>607|last1=Larsson|first1=SC|last2=Wolk|first2=A|title=Red and processed meat consumption and risk of pancreatic cancer: meta-analysis of prospective studies|url=http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v106/n3/full/bjc2011585a.html|issue=3|doi=10.1038/bjc.2011.585}}</ref>
