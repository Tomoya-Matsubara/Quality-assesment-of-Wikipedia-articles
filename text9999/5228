''' HDMS ''Lolland''''' (or ''Laaland'') was launched in March 1810. She served in at least four major engagements during the [[Gunboat War]] before she was transferred to the Norwegian navy after the [[Treaty of Kiel]] brought about the separation of Norway from Denmark in 1814. ''Lolland'' continued to serve with the Norwegian Navy until sold in 1847. 

==Dano-Norwegian navy==
For three months from 9 June 1810, ''Lolland'' served as a training ship for naval cadets at Copenhagen naval base. At the time she was under the command of Senior Lieutenant (later Captain) Holger Johan Bahnsen.<ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol 1, p.56.</ref> Also on board was Senior Lieutenant Georg Joachim Grodtschilling, a mathematics teacher at the naval academy.<ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol 1, pp.481-2.</ref><ref group=Note>Georg Grodtschilling was killed aboard [[HDMS Najaden (1811)| ''Najaden'']] at the [[Battle of Lyng<U+00F8>r]] in 1812.</ref> 
;1811
On 6 March 1811, ''Lolland'' sailed to her new station as part of the naval defences of southern Norway, where she was the command ship for a division of brigs. The year would be a tumultuous one for ''Lolland'' as she would engage in three actions against British warships under her new captain, [[Hans Peter Holm (1772 - 1812)|Hans Peter Holm]].<ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol. 1. pp. 598-601</ref>
<br />

By the 1 May 1811, ''Lolland'' had returned to the southern approaches to [[Egersund]] (SW Norway) with four other brigs,<ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol 1, p.599</ref><ref>Wandell (1915), p.368.</ref> unknown to the British.<ref>O'Bryne (1849), p.274.</ref> The British sent four boats from {{HMS|Belette|1806|6}}, {{HMS|Cherokee|1808|6}} and {{HMS|Clio|1806|6}},<ref>Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.14.</ref> into the western end of the sound, expecting to capture some shipping or do other mischief. The circumstances of locality and wind did not permit the Danish brigs to enter the sound from the further end, but Holm sent the Danish ships<U+2019> boats under Lieutenant Niels Gerhardt Langemach <ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol 2, p.68.</ref> to oppose the British. Some of the  Danes landed to set an ambush from the cliff tops, whilst the armed boats were hidden behind a [[skerry]]. As the British rowed boldly in, they met unexpected fire from howitzers and muskets; they immediately withdrew, with the Danish boats in pursuit. The Danes captured one of the British boats and her crew of an officer and 17 men, who had come from ''Belette'', and would have captured more but for the confusion that the explosion of a powder keg on one of the Danish boats caused. This enabled the remaining British boats to reach the protection of their squadron.

On 31 July 1811, ''Lolland'', in company with the brigs ''Lougen'' and ''Kiel'', encountered {{HMS|Brev Drageren|1807|6}} and {{HMS|Algerine|1810|6}} cruising together in Long Sound, Norway.{{#tag:ref|James reports that the three Danish vessels were the 20-gun [[HDMS Langeland (1808)|''Langeland'']], the 18-gun ''L<U+00FC>gum'', and the 16-gun ''Kiel''.<ref name=James/> However, there are no Danish records of any vessel with the name ''L<U+00FC>gum'', or anything like it, and one can infer from a biography of the captain of ''Langeland'' that she was not present at the action.|group=Note}} The Danes had 54 guns and 480 men, against the British 22 guns and 107 men.<ref group=Note>The ''Naval Chronicle'' gives the Danish strength as 60 guns (all long 18-pounders), and 550 men.</ref> Outnumbered and outgunned, the British vessels took flight.<ref name=NC26>''Naval Chronicle'' Vol. 26 (Jul-Dec 1811), pp.284-6.</ref> 

The next day ''Brev Drageren'' unsuccessfully re-engaged first one and then two of the brigs. In the inconclusive engagement each British vessel sustained one man killed, and ''Brev Drageren'' also had three wounded.<ref name=NC26/> In the second day<U+2019>s fight, ''Algerine'' sent a boat and sweeps to ''Brev Drageren'', which helped her escape the Danes, though not until after her crew had rowed for 30 hours.<ref name=NC26/><ref name=James>James (1837), Vol. 5, p.346.</ref> ''Lolland'' captured two cargo ships (galleases) that ''Brev Drageren'' had been escorting.<ref>Wandell (1915), p.369.</ref>

On 17 August 1811 {{HMS|Manly|1804|6}} sailed from [[Sheerness]] with a convoy for the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] under Lieutenant Richard William Simmonds. On 2 September 1811, off Rand<U+00F8>erne, some 30 miles SE of [[Arendal]] on the Norwegian coast in company with {{HMS| Chanticleer|1808|6}} they encountered three Danish 18-gun-brigs: ''Lolland'', ''Alsen'' (Senior Lieutenant M. L<U+00FC>tken), and ''Sams<U+00F8>'' (Senior Lieutenant Ridder F. Grodtschilling).

The Danish brigs were sailing westward along the coast when they sighted the two strange vessels, which by their night signals appeared to be enemy.<ref name=Danish>Danish source. [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~anders/books/Fra_Krigens_Tid/Allart.html]</ref> The Danes set out in pursuit, with ''Sams<U+00F8>'', which was closest, sailing for the nearer of the enemy vessels, ''Alsen'' and ''Lolland'' following. However, their quarry - the ''Chanticleer'' turned south-east, and ''Sams<U+00F8>'' and ''Alsen'' followed. ''Lolland'' then set off after the second ship, the ''Manly''. 

By 0340hrs ''Lolland'' had caught up with ''Manly''. Combat began at 0445hrs and at 0540hrs ''Lolland'' succeeded in crossing behind her quarry, which then [[striking the colours|struck]] at 0555hrs. ''Lolland'' sent a prize crew over that brought back Lieutenant Simmonds, of ''Manly''. In rough seas, neither Alsen nor Sams<U+00F8>e could catch HMS Chanticleer and so gave up the chase.

''Lolland'' had lost one man killed but had had no wounded; neither of the other two Danish vessels had sustained any casualties. ''Lolland'' had slight damage to her rigging and sails, but none to her hull; the other two Danish vessels reported negligible damage. The Danes took ''Manly'' into service, retaining her name and armament.<ref name=Orlogsmuseet>Orlogsmusset (Naval Museum)[http://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/M/pages/The%20Manly%281811%29.htm]</ref> Later that year, Captain Anthonius Krieger replaced Holm as captain of ''Lolland''.<ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol. 2, pp. 38-9.</ref>

;1812

In 1812, the Danish-Norwegian naval forces based in Norway were utilizing a sheltered but weakly defended anchorage at Sandoya. The Dano-Norwegian force consisted of the frigate ''[[HDMS Najaden (1811)|Najaden]]'', three brigs - ''Lolland'', ''Kiel'' (under the command of Otto Frederick Rasch),<ref>Translated from the Danish website [http://runeberg.org/dbl/13/0489.html].</ref> 'and ''Sams<U+00F8>e'' - as well as a number of gunboats. The British saw an opportunity to break the back of Dano-Norwegian seapower and sent the 64-gun [[Third-rate|Third Rate]] ship-of-the-line {{HMS|Dictator|1783|2}} and three brigs, the 18-gun [[Cruizer class brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Calypso|1805|2}}, 14-gun [[brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Podargus|1808|2}} and the 14-gun [[gun brig]] {{HMS|Flamer|1804|2}} to seek out the Danes.

The encounter took place on 6 July 1812 at [[Lyng<U+00F8>r]].

{{main|Battle of Lyng<U+00F8>r}}

The British sank ''Najaden'' and took ''Lolland'' and ''Kiel'' as prizes. However the British had to abandon their prizes after the two vessels grounded. The British did not set fire to either as they still had their crews and wounded aboard.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16623|date=14 July 1812|startpage=1361|endpage=1364}}</ref> The action cost the British nine men killed, 26 wounded, and two missing. Overall, the Danes acknowledged losing 300 men killed or wounded. 

;1813

In late December 1813 the three ships ''Lolland'', [[HMS Seagull (1805)|''The Seagull'']] and ''Sams<U+00F8>e'' sailed to [[Frederikshavn|Frederickshavn]], Jutland to escort a convoy of some 45 vessels carrying much-needed grain to Norway. They succeeded in their mission, although they lost one of the grain ships to a Swedish privateer. During the mission, a storm forced ''Sams<U+00F8>e'' to seek shelter in Danish waters; as a result, at the separation of Norway from Denmark, ''Sams<U+00F8>e'' remained with the Danish navy,<ref>The Norwegian Navy 1814</ref>until 1819<ref>Record Card for [http://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/S/pages/Sams%F8(1808).htm Sams<U+00F8>e]</ref>

==Norwegian Navy==
;1814
The separation from Denmark left Norway with a severely depleted cadre of naval officers and six active-duty brigs, of which ''Lolland'' was the largest:<ref group=Note>A seventh brig, [[HDMS Lougen (1805)|''Lougen'']] was by this time laid up.</ref> 
*''Lolland'' (Captain Ole Christopher Budde);<ref>Tops<U+00F8>e-Jensen, Vol. 1, pp.222-3.</ref>
*{{HMS|Seagull|1805|2}} (Senior Lieutenant J. Lund);
*''Allart'' (Senior Lieutenant S. Lous);
*''Langeland'' (Junior Lieutenant L<U+00F8>venskiold);
*''Alsen'' (Junior Lieutenant Bendz); and
*''Kiel'' (Junior Lieutenant Petersen). 

Budde took command of ''Lolland'' in May 1814. At this time ''Lolland'' became the command ship of the Norwegian navy<U+2019>s brig squadron.  The brigs Lolland, Seagull, Alsen og Kiel had sailed  to Frederickhavn to escort a large convoy of some 80 much-needed grain ships from Denmark to Norway. In the Skagerak two Swedish frigates, the ''Eurydice'' (44) and the ''af Chapman'' (36), tried to capture the convoy and its escorts but the ''Eurydice'' was too far way to be effective. The four Norwegian brigs, under orders not to fire unless first fired on, boxed in the ''af Chapman'' until the supply vessels successfully reached Norwegian waters.

Scandinavian politics of 1814 starting with the unsuccessful [[Treaty of Kiel]], the declaration of Norwegian independance, and the attempt by Sweden to recover its sovereignty by force, led to a truce at the [[Convention of Moss]] on 14 August 1814.  All units of the small Norwegian fleet remained on their respective stations until mid-October of that year, when they were ordered to be laid up.

==Fate==
''Lolland'' received a major refit in 1831. She was sold in 1847.
