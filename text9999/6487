It is the only large moon in the [[Solar System]] with a [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde orbit]], which is an orbit in the opposite direction to its planet's rotation. At 2,700&nbsp;km in diameter, it is the [[List of moons by diameter|seventh-largest moon]] in the Solar System. Triton comprises more than 99.5% of all the mass known to orbit Neptune, including the planet's rings and twelve other known moons.

Triton is named after the Greek sea god ''[[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]'' (<U+03A4><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD>), the son of [[Poseidon]] (the Greek god comparable to the Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]).

The third and fourth moons of [[Uranus]] ([[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] and [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]]), which Lassell discovered in 1851, were named by [[John Herschel]].<ref>{{cite web

==Orbit and rotation==
Triton is unique among all large moons in the Solar System for its [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde orbit]] around its planet (i.e., it orbits in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation).  Most of the outer [[irregular moon]]s of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] also have retrograde orbits, as do some of [[Uranus]]' outer moons. However, these moons are all quite small in comparison; the largest of them ([[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]]){{Ref_label|H|h|none}} has only 8% of the diameter (and 0.03% of the mass) of Triton.  

Triton's axis of rotation is also unusual, tilted 157 degrees with respect to Neptune's axis, which is in turn inclined 30 degrees from the plane of Neptune's orbit.<ref name=inclin /> The net result of these two axial tilts is that Triton's rotational axis points almost directly toward the Sun, much like Uranus'. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the sun, probably resulting in radical seasonal changes as one pole then the other moves into the sunlight. 
The close proximity of such a large moon to Neptune has resulted in [[Tidal deceleration#Tidal deceleration|tidal deceleration]], which has altered the moon's orbit and rotation through gravitational interaction.

Triton's revolution around Neptune has become a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. However, tides alone are not capable of circularizing Triton's orbit in such a short timescale, and [[Drag (physics)|gas drag]] from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role.<ref name=inclin /> Tidal interactions have also meant that Triton's already close orbit to Neptune is slowly decaying further, and predictions are that, some 3.6&nbsp;billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's [[Roche limit]].<ref name="Chyba">{{cite journal

==Capture==
[[Image:Outersolarsystem objectpositions labels comp.png|thumb|250 px|The [[Kuiper belt]], from which Triton is believed to have originated]]
Moons in retrograde orbits cannot have formed out of the same region of the [[solar nebula]] as the planets they orbit, but must have been captured from elsewhere. Triton is therefore suspected of being captured from the [[Kuiper belt]].<ref name="Agnor06"/> The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy objects extending outward from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 55&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun. Believed to be the point of origin for the majority of short-period [[comet]]s observed from Earth, it is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including [[Pluto]], which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the [[Plutino]]s) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.

The proposed capture of Triton may explain several features of the Neptunian system including the extremely eccentric orbit of Neptune's moon [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]] and the scarcity of moons as compared to the other gas giants.  Triton's initially [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbit would have intersected irregular moons and [[Perturbation (astronomy)|disrupted]] those of smaller natural moons, dispersing them through [[gravitation]]al interactions.<ref name=inclin /> 

The circularization of Triton's eccentric post-capture orbit would have resulted in heating of the moon by [[tidal force]]s. These would have kept Triton liquid for a billion years, which is supported by evidence of differentiation in the moon's interior.<ref name=solarsystemexploration/> Its similarity in size and composition to [[Pluto]] provides further confirmation of Triton's possible origin as a Pluto-like planetary body in the Kuiper belt.<ref name="Cruikshank2004">{{cite journal

There are two ways which Triton's capture may have occurred. In order to be gravitationally captured by a planet, a moon must be slowed down by losing energy. An early theory of how Triton may have been slowed was by collision with another object, either one that happened to be passing by Neptune (which is unlikely), or a moon or proto-moon in orbit around Neptune (which is more likely).<ref name= book /> Another hypothesis suggests that, before its capture, Triton may have had a massive companion similar to Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] with which it formed a binary. When the binary encountered Neptune, Triton's companion was expelled, providing the required mechanism to capture Triton in an orbit around the planet. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence, including binaries being very common among the large Kuiper belt objects.<ref name=binary>{{cite web

Because Triton's surface indicates a long history of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like [[Earth]], into a solid [[core (geology)|core]], a [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and a [[crust (geology)|crust]]. [[Water]], the most abundant [[Volatiles|volatile]] in the Solar System, comprises the moon's mantle, which lies over a core of rock and metal. There is enough rock in Triton's interior for solid-state [[convection]] to be occurring within its mantle, powered by [[radioactive decay]].

==Surface features==
All our detailed knowledge of the surface of Triton was acquired in a single encounter by the [[Voyager 2]] spacecraft in 1989. There are areas with rocky outcrops, and there are areas of canyons. Icy substances, mainly frozen [[methane]], cover part of the surface. Triton is relatively flat; its topography never varies beyond a kilometer.<ref name=book>{{cite book

Recent analysis of crater density and distribution has suggested that in geological terms, Triton's surface is extremely young, with regions varying from 50&nbsp;million years old to just 6&nbsp;million years old.<ref name="surface age"/>

===Cryovolcanism===
{{main|Cryovolcano}}
[[Image:Tritonfrost.gif|thumb|200 px|Bluish streaks across Triton's surface believed to have been left by eruptions from [[nitrogen]] geysers]]
Triton is geologically active; its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters. When the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe studied Triton, it observed numerous [[cryovolcano|icy volcanoes]] or [[geyser]]s erupting [[liquid nitrogen]], dust, or methane compounds from beneath the surface in plumes up to 8&nbsp;km high.<ref name=voyager/>  Though Triton is made of various ices, the subsurface processes that produce [[volcano]]es and [[rift valley]]s on Earth produce the same results on Triton, though with water and [[ammonia]] lavas as opposed to liquid rock.<ref name= book /> 

This volcanic activity is thought to be driven by seasonal heating from the Sun, unlike the [[tidal force|tidal]] heating responsible for the volcanoes of [[Io (moon)|Io]].<ref name=nature /> Heat from the Sun is trapped under surface nitrogen ice, which creates a form of "solid [[greenhouse effect]]", slowly heating the subsurface until nitrogen beneath evaporates and erupts through the crust.<ref name=book /> Between 1977 and the Voyager flyby in 1989, Triton shifted from a reddish coloration, like Pluto, to a far paler hue, suggesting that [[cryovolcanism]] in the intervening decade had covered older reddish material with lighter nitrogen frosts.<ref name= book />

Triton's entire surface is cut by complex valleys and ridges probably the result of tectonics and icy [[volcanism]]. The vast majority of surface features on Triton are endogenic<U+2014>the result of internal geological processes rather than external processes such as impacts. Most are volcanic and extrusive in nature, rather than tectonic.<ref name=book /> [[Hili (plume)|Hili]] and [[Mahilani (plume)|Mahilani]] are two candidate [[cryovolcano]]es that have been observed on Triton. They are named after a [[Zulu mythology|Zulu]] [[Tikoloshe|water sprite]] and a [[Tonga]]n sea spirit, respectively.<ref>[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/index.html ''USGS Astrogeology Research Program: Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature''], search for "Hili" and "Mahilani"</ref> Triton thus joins the Earth, [[Io (moon)|Io]], and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] as one of the few worlds of the Solar System with current volcanic activity.<ref> {{cite journal

===Polar cap, plains and ridges===
[[Image:Triton (moon).jpg|thumb|220px|Triton's bright red south polar cap]]
The southern polar region of Triton is covered by a highly reflective cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers. Little is known about the north pole of Triton because it was on the night side during the Voyager 2 encounter. However, it is thought that Triton must have a north polar cap.<ref name="Duxburyetal1993" />

The high plains found on Triton's eastern hemisphere cover over and blot out older features, and are therefore almost certainly the result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as [[Leviathan Patera]], which are probably the vents from which this lava emerged. The composition of this lava is unknown, though a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.<ref name= book />

Four roughly circular "walled plains" have been identified on Triton. They are the flattest regions so far discovered, with a variance in altitude of less than 200&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]. They are believed to have formed from eruption of icy lava.<ref name=book /> The plains near Triton's eastern limb are dotted with black points, the ''[[Macula (planetary geology)|maculae]]''.  Each of the maculae comprises a dark central patch surrounded by a white halo of material. The maculae all have similar diameters of between 20 and 30&nbsp;km. Some speculate the maculae are outliers of the southern polar cap, which is in retreat in summer.<ref name=book />

There are extensive ridges and valleys in complex patterns all over Triton's surface, probably the result of freezing<U+2013>thawing cycles.<ref>{{cite journal

===Cantaloupe terrain===
[[Image:PIA01537 modest.jpg|thumb|200px|The cantaloupe-skin terrain as seen from 130,000&nbsp;km by Voyager 2]]
Triton's western hemisphere consists of a strange series of fissures and depressions known as "cantaloupe terrain" because of its resemblance to the skin of a [[cantaloupe]] melon. Even though the terrain has few craters, it is believed that this is the oldest terrain on Triton.<ref name=cantaloupe/> This terrain probably covers much of the western half of Triton.<ref name= book /> 

This cantaloupe terrain, which is mostly dirty frozen water, is known to exist only on Triton. It contains depressions {{nowrap|30<U+2013>40 km}} in diameter.<ref name=cantaloupe/> The depressions (''cavi'') are probably not impact craters by meteorites because they are all of similar size and have smooth curves. The leading hypothesis as to their formation is [[diapir]]ism, the rising of "lumps" of less dense material through a stratum of denser material.<ref name= book /> Other hypotheses of the region's formation include that it formed by collapses, or by flooding caused by [[cryovolcanism]].<ref name=cantaloupe>{{cite journal

===Impact craters===
[[Image:PIA01538.jpg|thumb|180px|The few craters that exist on Triton reveal intense geologic activity]]
Due to constant erasure and modification by ongoing geological activity, [[impact crater]]s on Triton's surface are relatively rare. A census of Triton's craters imaged by [[Voyager 2]] found only 179 which were incontestably of impact origin, compared with 835 observed for [[Uranus|Uranus']] moon [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], which has only three percent of Triton's [[surface area]].<ref name=impact>{{cite journal

}}</ref> Because it orbits with one side permanently facing Neptune, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer impacts on its "trailing" hemisphere than on its "leading" hemisphere, as impacts on the leading hemisphere would be more frequent and more violent.<ref name=impact />  However, as Voyager only imaged 40% of Triton's surface, this remains uncertain.

==Observation and exploration==
[[Image:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|250px|Neptune and Triton three days after the flyby of Voyager 2]]

The orbital properties of Triton had been defined almost correctly in the 19th century but little was known about Triton itself until Voyager 2 arrived at the end of the 20th century. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930, when it was found to have a retrograde orbit around Neptune, and at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune's orbit.<ref name= book />

Before the arrival of Voyager 2, astronomers suspected that Triton might have [[liquid nitrogen]] seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density as much as 30% that of the Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, this was found to be completely false, but like Mars a denser early atmosphere is postulated.<ref>{{cite journal

The first attempt to measure the diameter of Triton was made by [[Gerard Kuiper]] in 1954. He obtained a value of 3,800&nbsp;km. Various subsequent attempts to measure the diameter of the satellite arrived at values ranging from 2,500 to 6,000&nbsp;km, or slightly smaller than our Moon, to nearly half the diameter of Earth.<ref>{{cite journal

In the 1990s, different observations from Earth were made of the limb of Triton using the occultation of stars by Triton. These observations indicated the presence of an atmosphere and an exotic surface. These observations suggest that the atmosphere is denser than was thought on the basis of the measurements made by Voyager 2.<ref name="Hubblesite" />
