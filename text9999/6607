===Education and religion===
Although she is a baptised [[Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church|Orthodox Christian]],<ref name="The National">{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080607/ART/126018472/-1/SPORT |title=Success on her own terms |accessdate=2008-06-08 |author=P Kennedy|date=2008-06-08 |work= [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|publisher=Abu Dhabi Media Company  }}</ref> whilst living in Belfast, Melua attended the [[Roman Catholic school]]s St Catherine's Primary School and [[Dominican College, Fortwilliam]], while her younger brother attended [[Protestant]] schools.<ref name="A"/> After completing her [[GCSE]]s at the all-girls' grammar school [[Nonsuch High School]] in [[Cheam]], [[Sutton]], Melua attended the [[BRIT School|BRIT School for the Performing Arts]] in the [[London Borough of Croydon]], undertaking a [[Business And Technology Education Council (BTEC)|BTEC]] with an A-level in music.

Melua didn't attend University, though she has often stated her desire to do so, saying that [[English literature]], [[history]] and [[physics]] would be her courses of choice should she get the chance to go to University.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= MELUA TAKES TIME OUT TO STUDY | work= contactmusic.com | date=2006-11-12|  url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/melua%20takes%20time%20out%20to%20study_1013428}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Melua met [[Luke Pritchard]], lead singer of [[The Kooks]], when they were both studying at the [[BRIT School]] where they began dating.

However, as Melua became more successful, the relationship came into difficulties and they split up in March 2005.<ref name="B"/><ref>{{cite web | author=Sharon Feinstein | title= I LOVE HIM BUT WE'VE SLOWLY BROKEN EACH OTHER'S HEARTS ...IT SUCKS | work=[[Sunday Mail]] | date=15 January 2006|  url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16585926&method=full&siteid=64736&headline=i-love-him-but-we-ve-slowly-broken-each-other-s-hearts----it-sucks-name_page.html }} </ref>

Melua is occasionally referred to as an '[[adrenaline junkie]]' because she enjoys [[roller coaster]]s and [[fun fair]]s and often [[paragliding|paraglides]] and [[Hang gliding|hang glides]].<ref>{{cite web| title=I'M THE CLOSEST THING TO CRAZY| work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]| author=Rick Fulton |date=24 September 2005| url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16167817&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=i-m-the-closest-thing-to-crazy--name_page.html}}</ref> She has [[Parachuting|skydived]] four times and taken several [[Aviator|flying lesson]]s, and in 2004 she was lowered from a 200 metre building in [[New Zealand]] at 60 [[mph]]. When asked about Melua being an 'adrenaline junkie', [[Mike Batt]] said, "she enjoys extremes, but in life her emotions are always in check."<ref name="The hitman and her"/>

===British nationality===
On 10 August 2005, Melua became a [[British nationality law|British citizen]] with her parents and brother. The citizenship ceremony took place in [[Weybridge, Surrey]].<ref name="D">{{cite web | author= | title= Singer Melua made British citizen | work=[[BBC News]] | date=11 August 2005|  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4140802.stm }}  </ref> On gaining British nationality, Melua was eligible for a British passport.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= Katie Melua, 'piecing' together global fame | work= Sound Generator | date=2006-08-06|  url=http://www.soundgenerator.com/news/showarticle.cfm?articleid=7837&page=2}}</ref> Becoming a British citizen meant that Melua had held three citizenships before she was 21; first [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], then [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] and finally [[United Kingdom|British]]. After the ceremony, Melua stated her pride at her newest nationality. "As a family, we have been very fortunate to find a happy lifestyle in this country and we feel we belong. We still consider ourselves to be Georgian, because that is where our roots are, and I return to Georgia every year to see my uncles and grandparents, but I am proud to now be a British citizen.

==Recording career==
===Mike Batt===
It was when performing at a [[Brit School]] showcase that Melua caught the eye of [[Mike Batt]], an English songwriter and producer who was originally looking for an acid-rock band, bass player<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Katie in Iceland | work= dagskra.ruv.is | year=2007|  url=http://dagskra.ruv.is/streaming/sjonvarpid/?file=4365539/2 }}</ref> and a singer capable of singing "jazz and blues in an interesting way".<ref>{{cite web | author=[[Mike Batt]] | title=Katie Melua | work= dramatico site | year=2003|  url=http://www.dramatico.com/artists.html }}</ref> After hearing Melua sing "Faraway Voice" (a song she wrote about the death of her idol [[Eva Cassidy]]) Batt signed the 18 year-old Melua to his small [[Dramatico]] recording and management company and sent her into the studio.<ref>{{cite web | author= Marcus Leroux | title= Fallen from Heaven | work=The Oxford Student | date=27 May 2004|  url=http://www.oxfordstudent.com/tt2004wk5/Features/fallen_from_heaven}}</ref>

===''Call off the Search''===
{{Main|Call off the Search}}
''Call off the Search'' featured two songs written by Melua: "Belfast (Penguins and Cats)", a song about Melua's experience of her time in the troubled capital of [[Northern Ireland]], and "Faraway Voice", a song about the death of [[Eva Cassidy]]. Melua also covered songs by [[Delores J. Silver]] ("Learnin' the Blues"), [[John Mayall]] ("[[Crawling up a Hill]]"), [[Randy Newman]] ("I Think it's Going to Rain Today") and [[James Shelton]] ("Lilac Wine").Originally a major U.K. hit for singer Elkie Brooks. A final six songs on the album were by [[Mike Batt]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Johnny Loftus | title= "Call off the Search" Review | work=allmusic | year=2003|  url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:a0o7gjer46ic~T1 }}</ref>

It was initially difficult for Melua and Batt to get airplay for the album's lead single, "[[The Closest Thing to Crazy]]". This changed when [[BBC Radio 2]] producer [[Paul Walters]] heard the single and played it on the popular [[Terry Wogan]] breakfast show.<ref>{{cite web | author=Andrew Purcell | title= Talk the talk | work= [[The Guardian]]| date=11 August 2006|  url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1841267,00.html }}</ref> Wogan played "The Closest Thing to Crazy" frequently in November and December 2003 in an attempt to make it that year's [[Christmas number-one]]. The single only reached number 10, but Wogan's support raised Melua's profile and when ''[[Call off the Search]]'' was released it became an immediate hit, reaching number one on the UK albums chart in January 2004. ''Call off the Search'' reached the top five in Ireland, top twenty in Norway, top thirty in a composite European chart and top fifty in Australia. In the UK, the album sold 1.2 million copies, making it four times [[platinum record|platinum]], and spent six weeks at the top of the charts. It sold three million copies worldwide. Subsequent singles did not reach the success of the first <U+2014> the second single and album title track, "[[Call off the Search (song)|Call off the Search]]", reached number 19, and the third single, "[[Crawling up a Hill]]", got to number 41.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= Melua Profile | work= purevolume | date=|  url=http://www.purevolume.com/katiemelua }}</ref>

===''Piece by Piece''===
{{Main|Piece by Piece (album)}}

Melua's second album, ''[[Piece by Piece (album)|Piece by Piece]]'', was released on 26 September 2005. Its [[lead single]] was "[[Nine Million Bicycles]]", which was released a week before the album on 19 September. The first UK airplay for the single was on the Terry Wogan show on 1 August. The album contains four more songs written by Melua herself, four more by Batt, one Batt/Melua collaboration and three more songs described as new versions of "great songs". The band line-up was the same as on the first album. The album debuted at the number-one spot on the [[UK Albums Chart]] on the week of 3 October 2005.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= Katie Melua makes mellow comeback | work= [[BBC News]] | date=26 September 2005|  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4268288.stm }}</ref>

On 30 September 2005, Melua came under criticism in ''[[The Guardian]]'' from writer and scientist [[Simon Singh]] for the lyrics of the track "Nine Million Bicycles". Melua's disputed lyrics were:
{{cquote|We are 12 billion light-years from the edge. That's a guess <U+2014> no-one can ever say it's true, but I know that I will always be with you.}}
They were interpreted by Singh as an assault on the accuracy of the work of cosmologists<ref>{{cite web | author=[[Simon Singh]] | title= Katie Melua's bad science | work= [[The Guardian]]| date=30 September 2005|  url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1581445,00.html }}</ref> which sparked a series of letters from other ''Guardian'' readers, agreeing or disagreeing.<ref>{{cite web | author= [[Mike Batt]]| title= A few million light years short of reality | work= [[The Guardian]]| date=6 October 2005|  url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1585880,00.html }}</ref> On 15 October, Melua and Singh appeared on the [[BBC]]'s [[Today programme|''Today'' programme]], and Melua unveiled a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JMFiBwcVyQ re-recording of the song]which included Singh's tongue-in-cheek amendments to the lyrics:
{{cquote|We are 13.7 billion light-years from the edge of the observable universe, That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars, And with the available information, I predict that I will always be with you.}}

Both sides amicably agreed that the new lyrics were less likely to achieve commercial success, amidst a discussion about [[Science|scientific accuracy]] versus [[artistic licence]]. Melua said that she "should have known better" because she used to be a member of the [[astronomy club]] at school.<ref>{{cite web | author=  | title= Today Program | work=[[BBC Radio 4]] | date=2005-10-15 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/ram/today1_melua_20051015.ram }}</ref>

===Charity work===
In November 2004 Melua was asked to take part in [[Band Aid 20]] in which she joined a chorus of British and Irish pop singers to create a rendition of "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" to raise money for famine relief in Africa. This was in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the original [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= Geldof hails new Band Aid single | work= [[BBC News]] | date= 15 November 2004| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4008039.stm }}

Melua is a [[goodwill ambassador]] to the charity [[Save the Children]], and in 2005 she went to [[Sri Lanka]] to see the work the charity was doing for children in the area after the [[Sri Lankan civil war|civil war]] and [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Indian Ocean tsunami]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Katie Melua | title= Katie's diary | work=[[Save the Children]] | date=15 June 2005 | url=http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/scuk/jsp/resources/details.jsp?id=2889&group=resources&section=news&subsection=details }}</ref> In 2006 Melua donated all the proceeds from her single "[[Spider's Web (song)|Spider's Web]]" to the charity.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= MELUA TO DONATE SINGLE PROCEEDS TO CHARITY | work=contact music | date=2006-04-11 | url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/melua%20to%20donate%20single%20proceeds%20to%20charity_11_04_2006}}</ref>

Melua is a supporter of the [[Oxfam]] charity shops, using them frequently to buy her clothing.<ref name="B"/> However, she has stated that this is related as much to her dislike of spending and glamour as it is to her support for the charity,<ref name="C"/> admitting that, when out in public, she looks "like a [[tramp]]" and that her hairdresser playfully calls her look "the [[Romania]]n window cleaner".<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= I Look like a tramp | work= contact music | date=2005-09-20| url=http://excite.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/melua%20i%20look%20like%20a%20tramp }}</ref>

On 7 July 2007 Melua performed at the [[Live Earth concert, Hamburg|German leg]] of [[Live Earth]] in [[Hamburg]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Maureen Coleman | title= Katie sings to save the planet | work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] | date=  2007-07-05| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/live-earth/article2737816.ece}}</ref>

In December 2007, Melua released a cover of the [[Louis Armstrong]] song ''"[[What A Wonderful World]]"'' in which she sang with a recording of the late [[Eva Cassidy]]. All profits from the single, which entered the UK singles chart at #1 on 16 December 2007, went to the [[Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Melua duet headed for number one | work=[[BBC News]] | date= 2007-12-12| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7140478.stm}}</ref>

===World record holder===
On 2 October 2006, Melua entered the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' for playing the deepest underwater concert 303 metres below sea level on [[Statoil]]'s [[Troll A platform]] in the [[North Sea]]. Melua and her band underwent extensive medical tests and survival training in Norway before flying by helicopter to the rig.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= Melua's deep sea gig sets record | work=[[BBC News]] | date=  2 October 2006| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5396970.stm }}</ref>
Melua later described achieving the record as "the most surreal gig I have ever done". Melua's concert is commemorated in the DVD release ''Concert Under the Sea'', released in June 2007.

Melua has said on numerous occasions how [[Queen (band)|Queen]] were a huge influence on her as a child/teenager, with one of her memories being buying Queen's ''[[Greatest Hits II (Queen)|Greatest Hits II]]'' and singing along to "[[Radio Ga Ga]]" in her home country Georgia.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title= The World According To... Katie Melua | work=[[The Independent]] | date=2004-07-20| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040720/ai_n12800275}}</ref>.
