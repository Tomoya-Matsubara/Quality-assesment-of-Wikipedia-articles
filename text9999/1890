'''WestJet Airlines Ltd.''' ({{TSX|WJA}}) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[low-cost carrier]] based in [[Calgary, Alberta]], that flies to most major cities in Canada and 11 cities in the [[United States]]. WestJet is the second-largest Canadian carrier behind [[Air Canada]] (or third-largest if you count [[Air Canada Jazz]]). WestJet is a rarity in the airline industry due to the fact that it is non-unionized.  [[Profit sharing|Profit-sharing]] is credited for this fact. WestJet plans to be one of the world's top 5 most profitable international airlines, by 2016.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/cp/business/070611/b0611157A.html</ref>. WestJet was rated the second-best low-cost airline in North America.<ref>http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards-2006/Lowcost.htm Accessed on May 14th, 2007.</ref>

==History==
Founded on [[February 29]], [[1996]] by [[Clive Beddoe]], [[Mark Hill]], [[Tim Morgan]], and [[Donald Bell]], WestJet tried to follow the same path as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Morris Air]], as a low-cost carrier. Originally meant to be a [[western Canada]] operation, WestJet soon became one of the fastest growing airlines in the world.

On [[February 29]], [[1996]], the first WestJet flight (a [[Boeing 737]]) departed. At that time, the airline served [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] (the airline's hub), [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Kelowna, British Columbia|Kelowna]], [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], and [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] with a fleet of three [[Boeing 737#737-200|Boeing 737-200]] aircraft and two-hundred twenty employees. By the end of that same year, they had included [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. In 1997, service to [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] was added. In addition, 1997 marked the one millionth passenger carried.

In 1999, a milestone was reached when WestJet was able to offer its first public sharing at 2.5 million shares. Also in 1999, the cities of [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]], [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], and [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] were added to WestJet's route map. In 2000, the airline expanded to Canada's [[Eastern Region|eastern region]], reaching [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Moncton]], and [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]], and choosing Hamilton as the airline's eastern region hub. That year, Beddoe, Hill, Morgan and Bell were given the ''Ernst & Young entrepreneur of the year'' award in Canada for their contribution to the Canadian [[Airline|airline industry]]. In 2001, expansion continued to include [[Fort McMurray, Alberta|Fort McMurray]] and [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]], and to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Thompson, Manitoba|Thompson]] and [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]], although service to some of these cities was subsequently withdrawn. The airline's four creators also received another entrepreneurship award. In 2002, the airline added two new eastern Canadian destinations: the cities of [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]]. In April 2003, WestJet added [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], and [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]]. 

In April 2004, WestJet moved its eastern hub from Hamilton to Toronto.  All of the flights between Ottawa and Hamilton and Montreal and Hamilton were moved to Toronto, a move that brought WestJet more fully into the lucrative Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal triangle.

In 2004, a number of [[United States|U.S.]] destinations were added or announced. These included [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[LaGuardia International Airport|New York City]]. 

WestJet's transborder flights fly non-stop from Calgary (WestJet's main hub), as well as Edmonton, Kelowna, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg.

[[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] was added in early 2005 to the company's list of destinations, as was [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], while New York-LaGuardia was dropped. In April 2005, they announced new seasonal service to [[Charlottetown]] but ceasing  service to Gander. In [[June 2005]], the airline announced it was ceasing service to Windsor, effective [[October 30]], [[2005]], shifting capacity to nearby London. In fall 2005, [[Fort Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] were added to the growing list of destinations. 

After rumours and speculation surrounding the implementation of [[ETOPS/LROPS|extended-range twin-engine operations]] (ETOPS), WestJet announced new service to the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian Islands]] from Vancouver on [[September 20]], [[2005]]. In [[December 2005]], the airline began flying from Vancouver to [[Honolulu]] and Vancouver to [[Maui]]. All flights returning from the Hawaiian Islands are overnight flights ([[Red-eye flight|red-eyes]]) allowing the carrier to reduce fleet downtime.

In 2006, WestJet announced they were dropping their service to San Francisco and San Diego. WestJet's first scheduled service outside Canada and the United States began in 2006 with service to [[Nassau, Bahamas]]. This was considered a huge milestone within the company's long-term destination strategy and was a vital goal for future international market presence.

In 2007, WestJet announced that they would begin flights from [[Deer Lake Airport (Newfoundland)|Deer Lake Regional Airport]] in Newfoundland, [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] in New Brunswick, and [[Kitchener-Waterloo]] in Ontario. There would be direct flights to [[Toronto]] from [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and [[Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador|Deer Lake]], and flights to [[Calgary]] from [[Kitchener]]-[[Waterloo]]. 

In June 2007, WestJet added three seasonal flights from Toronto to Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

On August 15, 2007, WestJet added seasonal scheduled service to [[Cabo San Lucas]] and [[Mazatlan]] in Mexico as well as [[Kona]], [[Hawaii]].

In late 2002 the Airline was accused by rival Air Canada of espionage for their role in accessing [[Trade secret|confidential information]] in order to gain a business advantage.<ref>[http://www.hanford.gov/oci/maindocs/ci_r_docs/Air_Canada_accuses_WestJet_of_espionage.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051209.wxraircan09/BNStory/Business/ Globe and Mail article] - Espionage accusation</ref><ref>[http://today.reuters.com/business/newsArticle.aspx?type=ousiv&storyID=2006-05-29T165939Z_01_WNA6649_RTRIDST_0_BUSINESSPRO-AIRLINES-CANADA-DC.XML Reuters] - WestJet settled with Air Canada</ref> On [[May 29]], [[2006]], WestJet issued a [[News release|press release]] <ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060529.waircanada0529/BNStory/Business/home/ WestJet press release] - Regarding spying on Air Canada</ref> admitting its involvement in the Air Canada espionage scandal, and agreeing to pay over 5 million dollars in legal and investigation fees to Air Canada, and to donate over $10 million to various children's charities in the name of Air Canada and WestJet.

==Current status==
During a second quarter [[conference call]] in 2004, [[Clive Beddoe]] announced that WestJet would serve the United States. On [[September 20]], [[2004]] WestJet commenced the first phase of its trans-border flights by flying from Calgary and Toronto to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] as well as Toronto to New York LaGuardia. However, WestJet ended service to [[New York]] ([[LaGuardia International Airport|LaGuardia]]) on  [[July 4]], [[2005]], citing an inability to secure gates at the airport. 

Soon after, the airline announced new service from Calgary to Fort Lauderdale; Edmonton to Las Vegas; Kelowna to Las Vegas; Toronto to Fort Myers and Phoenix; Montreal to Fort Lauderdale; Winnipeg to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Phoenix; and Vancouver to Las Vegas, Palm Springs, and Phoenix.  

[[Image:Westjet Boeing 737.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A departing WestJet Boeing 737-800]]
WestJet Airlines entered into a two-year agreement with [[Air Transat]] in August 2003 whereby WestJet 737 aircraft would be filled by Transat's two main tour operators, World of Vacations and Air Transat Holidays. The planes are operated by WestJet crews. Some of the destinations where WestJet planes can be found are the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Panama City, Panama|Panama City]], [[Canc<U+00FA>n]], [[Mazatl<U+00E1>n]], [[Varadero|Varadero, Cuba]] and [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]]. 

In 2005, WestJet implemented [[In-flight Entertainment|Personal TV (PTV)]] from [[LiveTV]] on board its 737-700 and -800 fleet. Channels include [[Global TV]], [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[CBS]], [[Citytv]], [[Treehouse TV]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and a WestJet Channel, which shows a regional map with the aircraft's location, [[GPS]] derived altitude, and [[groundspeed]]. WestJet plans to add Live TV onto their 737-600 aircraft beginning in the winter of 2007.

WestJet was to be the Boeing launch customer for the 737-600 winglets, but announced in their Q2 2006 results that they were not going to move ahead with those plans.  WestJet CEO Clive Beddoe cited the cost and time associated with their installation was not warranted as they are primarily used for short-haul routes.  As a result of the abandonment of the program to install winglets on these aircraft, WestJet incurred a one-time charge of approximately $609,000.

In [[August 2006]], in a [[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]] interview, Sean Durfy (then executive Vice-President of Marketing but since appointed to President of the company in [[September 2006]]) stated that WestJet was in talks with, and considering joining [[Oneworld]], a code and route sharing alliance that includes airlines such as [[American Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Qantas]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[LAN Airlines]] and [[Japan Airlines]].  If a deal with Oneworld was reached, it would allow WestJet to maintain its scheduling flexibility.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brent  |last=Jang |title=WestJet Looks to Fly Higher with Oneworld |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060831.wxrwestjet31/BNStory/Business/home |work=The Globe and Mail |date=[[August 31]], [[2006]] |accessdate=2006-10-31 }}</ref> It would increase passenger traffic for [[WestJet]], while filling in a Canadian void for the [[Oneworld]] alliance. Canadian travellers to [[South America]] would be serviced by the most comprehensive list of regional destinations of all three major aviation alliances.

On [[October 26]], [[2006]], WestJet announced that it had its best quarterly profit ever, reaching C$52.8 million.  WestJet gained [[market share]] and kept its costs under control, helping profits to surge.

The airline flies a fleet that consists exclusively of [[Boeing 737]]s, taking a cue from the successful single operating type model pioneered by [[Southwest Airlines]]. The first deliveries of 737-600 and 737-800 aircraft began in 2005, and by September 2006 the final 737-600 aircraft was delivered.  WestJet's future aircraft orders only consist of 737-700 and 737-800 models. WestJet plans to have a fleet of 111 aircraft by the end of 2013.

Boeing confirmed on [[August 2]], [[2007]] that WestJet had placed an order for 20 [[Boeing 737#737 Next Generation|Boeing 737NG]].<ref>[[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q3/070802c_nr.html</ref> The order is primarily for B737-700 but with conversion rights to B737-800s.

===Retired fleet===
* [[Boeing 737#737 Original|Boeing 737-200]] (1996-2006)

It was announced early in 2005 that the 737-200 fleet would be retired within the year, to be replaced by newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft. On [[July 12]], [[2005]], WestJet announced that it had completed the sale of its remaining [[Boeing 737#737 Original|Boeing 737-200]] to Miami-based Apollo Aviation Group (Apollo). 

On [[January 9]], [[2006]], the last Boeing 737-200 (Tail 748 C-FCWJ) was flown during a [[Flypast|fly-by]] ceremony at the WestJet hangar in Calgary. (See External Links). The aircraft was flown by Don Bell. The last commercial revenue flight by a -200 was a [[Charter airline|charter flight]], Las Vegas to Calgary, arriving at 0130 [[January 9]], [[2006]], flown by tail 741 (C-GWWJ). Currently, WestJet claims to operate the youngest fleet of aircraft by a major commercial airline in North America, with an average age of two years (as of [[31 December]] [[2005]]).<ref>[http://c3dsp.westjet.com/guest/about/fleetTemplate.jsp WestJet] - Fleet information</ref>

==Incidents and accidents==

* On [[September 6]], [[2007]] a WestJet Boeing 737-700 aircraft en route to Halifax from Calgary encountered sudden turbulence just north of Sudbury Ontario, causing a sharp drop which injured 9 passengers.  The plane carried on to Halifax and landed without incident.<ref>http://news.sympatico.msn.ctv.ca/TopStories/ContentPosting.aspx?feedname=CTV-TOPSTORIES_V2&newsitemid=CTVNews%2f20070906%2fplane_turbulence_070907&showbyline=True</ref>
* In [[August]], [[2007]], a WestJet Boeing 737-700 aircraft carrying 136 passengers, including crew, had a close call at [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. A WestJet plane arriving from Calgary nearly collided with a [[Northwest Airlines]] airplane that was taking off from a parallel runway. The plane took off without incident.
* In [[June]], [[2006]], a WestJet Boeing 737-700 aircraft carrying 103 passengers including crew, had to return to Vancouver, thirty five minutes after [[Takeoff|taking off]] due to the failure of one of the flight control systems. The plane landed without incident.
* In [[December, 2003]], a WestJet Boeing 737-700 aircraft carrying 57 passengers including crew, had to return to Calgary, seven minutes after [[Takeoff|taking off]] when one of its [[turbofan]] engines failed. The plane landed without incident.

==Livery==
The WestJet planes are mostly white, except for the lettering on the cabins, the tail, and the metallic wings and [[tailfins]]. 

The tail is divided into rough and slanted thirds, coloured (from back to front) navy blue, white, and teal. This pattern is used on the outside of the [[Wingtip device|blended winglets]] at the end of the wings, while on the inside, the winglets are painted white with the words '''WestJet.com''' in black lettering.
