'''Christ's College Chapel''' is part of [[Christ's College, Christchurch]].

==Description==
[[File:Christ's College Chapel 98.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of Christ's College Chapel]]
The chapel was designed by [[Robert Speechly]] and was built in 1867. Its simple style was in harmony with [[Christ's College Big School]], which is four years older. The chapel was extended in 1884 to a design by [[Benjamin Mountfort]], who added transepts and a chancel; an earlier design by [[William Armson]] was rejected. In 1888, a Mountfort-designed organ chamber was added.<ref name="NZHPT Chapel">{{NZHPT|3277|Christ's College Chapel|20 June 2012}}</ref>

The chapel more than doubled in size in 1955 based on a design by [[Paul Pascoe]], who did not interfere with the Gothic Revival appearance of the school's quadrangle.<ref name="NZHPT Chapel" />

The chapel was used for the funeral service for Christchurch architect [[Peter Beaven]] in June 2012.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sachdeva |first=Sam |title=Hundreds gather for Beaven's funeral |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7080237/Hundreds-gather-for-Beavens-funeral |accessdate=20 June 2012 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=11 June 2012}}</ref>

The chapel was registered as a heritage building by the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] on 27 June 1985 with registration number 3277 classified as A. With the change of the classification system, the building later became a Category I listing.<ref name="NZHPT Chapel" /><ref name="NZHPT Canterbury and South Canterbury">{{cite book |last=Cattell |first=John |title=Historic Buildings of Canterbury and South Canterbury |year=1988 |publisher=Government Printing Office Publishing |location=Wellington|isbn=0-477-01329-5|accessdate=20 June 2012 |page=23}}</ref>
