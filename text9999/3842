The participation of '''Puerto Ricans in World War II''' as members of the [[Military of the United States|United States armed forces]] included guarding U.S. military installations in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] and active combat participation in both the [[European theater of World War II|European]] and [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theatres]] of the war. [[Puerto Ricans]] and people of Puerto Rican descent have participated as members of the U.S. armed forces in every conflict in which the United States has been involved since [[World War I]].

Puerto Ricans had obtained [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizenship]] as a result of the 1917 [[Jones-Shafroth Act]] and were expected to serve in the military. When a [[Japanese Imperial Navy]] carrier fleet launched an unexpected [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on [[December 7]], [[1941]], Puerto Ricans were required to bear arms in defense of the United States. During [[World War II]], more than 53,000 Puerto Ricans served in the U.S. military.<ref name="neta_unit1">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-19

Those who resided in the mainland of the United States were assigned to regular units of the military. They were often subject to the racial discrimination that was widespread in the United States at the time.<ref name="neta_unit1"/>

Puerto Rican women who served had their options  restricted to nursing or administrative positions. In World War II some of the island's men played active roles as commanders in the military. The military did not keep statistics in regard to the total number of Hispanics who served in the regular units of the Armed Forces only of those who served in Puerto Rican units; therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact number of Puerto Ricans who served in World War II
==Lead-up to World War II==
[[Image:PRWWII .jpg|right|244px|thumb|Soldiers of the 65th Infantry training in Salinas, Puerto Rico, August 1941]]
The seeds of a full-scale World War were planted in [[Asia]] in 1937 when [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan invaded China]] and in [[1939#September|1939]] in [[Europe]] when [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] invaded [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. In October 1940, the 295th and 296th Infantry Regiments of the Puerto Rican National Guard, founded by Major General [[Luis R. Esteves]], were called into Federal Active Service and assigned to the Puerto Rican Department in accordance with the existing [[War Plan Orange]].<ref name="neta_marin">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18 | url= http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/marin.htm

During that period of time, Puerto Rico's economy was suffering from the consequences of the [[Great Depression]], and unemployment was widespread. Unemployment was one of the reasons that some Puerto Ricans choose to join the Armed Forces.

Most of these men were trained in Camp Las Casas in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]], Puerto Rico and were assigned to the [[65th Infantry Regiment]], a [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] unit made up mostly of Puerto Ricans. The rumors of war spread, and the involvement of the United States was believed to be a question of time. The 65th Infantry was ordered to intensify its [[military exercise|maneuvers]], many of which were carried out at Punta Salinas near the town of [[Salinas, Puerto Rico|Salinas]] in Puerto Rico.<ref name=Ruiz>{{cite web |accessdate=2007-03-18 |url= http://bellsouthpwp.net/r/u/ruiz_b/LuisRaulEsteves/Luis_Raul_Esteves.htm |title= Major General Luis Ra<U+00FA>l Esteves V<U+00F6>lckers| author= Bruce C.

==World War II==
After the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the US into the war, the Puerto Ricans living on the island and on the U.S. mainland began to fill the ranks of the four major branches of the Armed Forces. Some volunteered for patriotic reasons, some joined in need of employment, and others were [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]].

In 1943, there were approximately 17,000 Puerto Ricans under arms, including the 65th Infantry Regiment and the Puerto Rico National Guard. The Puerto Rican units were stationed either in Puerto Rico or in the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].

[[French colonial empires|France's possessions]] in the [[Caribbean]] began to protest against the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] in France, a government backed by the Germans who invaded France. The island of [[Martinique]] was on the verge of [[civil war]]. The United States organized a joint [[United States Army|Army]]-[[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] task force, which included the 295th Infantry (minus one battalion) and the 78th Engineer Battalion, both from Puerto Rico for the occupation of Martinique. The use of these infantry units were put on hold because Martinique's local government decided to turn over control of the colonies to the French Committee of National Liberation.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WH-Guard/USA-WH-Guard-16.html

In 1943, the 65th Infantry was sent to [[Panama]] to protect the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] sides of the [[Isthmus of Panama|isthmus]]. The 295th Infantry Regiment followed in 1944, departing from San Juan, Puerto Rico to the [[Panama Canal Zone]].

Puerto Ricans who were fluent in [[English language|English]] or who resided on the mainland were assigned to regular Army units. Such was the case of Sgt. First Class Louis Ramirez, who was assigned to the 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized, which landed at [[Normandy]] on [[D-Day]] ([[Battle of Normandy]]), [[June 6]], and advanced into France during the Battle of [[Saint-Malo]], where they were met by enemy tanks, bombs and soldiers. PFC Fernando Pagan was also a Puerto Rican who resided on the mainland; he was assigned to unit Company A, 293 Combat Engineering Battalion, which arrived in Normandy on [[June 10]]. Others, like Frank Bonilla, were assigned to the 290th Infantry Regiment, 75th Infantry Division, which later fought in the front lines at the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. Bonilla was the recipient of the Silver Star and Purple Heart medals for his actions in combat. One Puerto Rican who earned a [[Bronze Star Medal]] in the Battle of the Bulge was PFC [[Joseph A. Unanue]], whose father was the founder of [[Goya Foods]]. Unanue had trained for armored infantry, and went to the European Theater as a gunner in A company, 63rd Armored Infantry Battalion, 11th Armored Division.

Calero attacked the squad, killing ten of them and capturing 21 shortly before being wounded himself. Following these events, he was nicknamed "One-Man Army" by his comrades. A [[Silver Star]] was among the 22 decorations and medals which he was awarded from the US Army for his actions during World War II, thus becoming the second most decorated soldier (the most decorated US soldier was [[Audie Murphy]]) in the United States Military during that war.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2006-11-19 |url=http://www.prsoldier.com/17-aug2005.pdf

PFC. Santos Deliz was assigned to Battery D, 216 AAA, a gun battalion, and sent to Africa in 1943 to join General [[George S. Patton]]'s Third Army. According to Deliz, Patton demanded the best from all under him, including cooks and kitchen hands. Deliz, who earned a Bronze Star Medal, once recounted an experience which he had with General Patton: <blockquote>"Patton went in to inspect and he scolded me because I had rations over the amount I should've had. The rations were food the GIs didn't want, so instead of dumping it, I sometimes gave it to the people who were around there."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18 |url=http://utopia.utexas.edu/explore/latino/narratives/4delizsantos.html

Some also served in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]. Among them were Captain Mihiel "Mike" Gilormini and T/Sgt Clement Resto.

Captain [[Mihiel Gilormini|Mihiel "Mike" Gilormini]] served in the [[Royal Air Force]] and in the Army Air Corps during World War II. He was a flight commander whose last combat mission was attacking the airfield at [[Milan]]o, [[Italy]]. His last flight in Italy gave air cover for General [[George C. Marshall]]'s visit to [[Pisa]]. He was the recipient of the Silver Star Medal, the [[Air Medal]] with four clusters and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross]] 5 times.   Gilormini later became the Founder of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard and retired as Brigadier General. 

T/Sgt Clement Resto served with the 303rd Bomb Group and participated in numerous bombing raids over Germany. During a bombing mission over [[Duren]], Germany, Resto's plane, a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], was shot down . He was captured by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to [[Stalag|Stalag XVII-B]] where he spent the rest of the war as a [[prisoner of war]].

==Women in the military==
[[Image:Nurses in Tortugero.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Puerto Rican nurses in Camp Tortuguero]]
{{see also|Puerto Rican Women in the Military}}
When the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not have to deal with the language barriers. Among them was Second Lieutenant [[Carmen Dumler]], who became one of the first Puerto Rican female military officers. A total of 200 women from Puerto Rico served as nurses.

Not all the women served as nurses: some women served in administrative duties in the mainland or near combat zones. Such was the case of Tech4 [[Carmen Contreras-Bozak]] who belonged to the 149th Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. The 149th [[Women's Army Corps|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]] (WAAC) Post Headquarters Company was the first WAAC Company to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbor for Europe on January 1943. The unit arrived in Northern Africa on [[January 27]], [[1943]] and rendered overseas duties in [[Algiers]] within General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s theater headquarters. Tech4 [[Carmen Contreras-Bozak]], a member of this unit, was the first Hispanic to serve in the U.S. Women's Army Corps as an interpreter and in numerous administrative positions.<ref name=Women>{{cite web |url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/PRHistory.html |title=Puerto Rican Servicewomen in Defense of the Nation |accessmonthday=October 10 |accessyear=2006 |author=Judith Bellafaire |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Women In Military Service For America Memorial Foundation |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utopia.utexas.edu/explore/latino/narratives/07Bozak_Carmen.html |title=Young woman's life defined by service in Women's Army Corps |accessdate=2006-10-10 |author=Katie Kennon|work=US Latinos and Latinas & World War II}}</ref>
 
Another was Lieutenant Maria Rodriguez Denton, who was the first known woman of Puerto Rican descent who became an officer in the United States Navy as member of the [[WAVES]]. The Navy assigned LTJG Denton as a library assistant at the Cable and Censorship Office in New York City. It was Lt. Denton who forwarded the news (through channels) to President [[Harry S. Truman]] that the war had ended.

==Discrimination==
During World War II, the United States Army was segregated. Puerto Ricans who resided on the mainland and who were fluent in English served alongside their "[[White people|White]]" counterparts. "[[Black people|Black]]" Puerto Ricans were assigned to units made up mostly of African-Americans. The vast majority of the Puerto Ricans from the island served in Puerto Rico's segregated units, like the 65th Infantry and the Puerto Rico National Guard's 285th and 296th regiments. 
[[Racial discrimination]] practiced against [[Hispanic]] Americans, including Puerto Ricans on the United States' east coast and [[Mexican American]]s in California and the Southwest, was widespread. Some Puerto Ricans who served in regular Army units were witnesses to the racial discrimination of the day.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18

==Post World War II==
The American participation in the Second World War came to an end in Europe on [[May 8]], [[1945]] when the western Allies celebrated "[[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]]" (Victory in Europe Day) upon Germany's surrender, and in the Asian theater on [[August 14]], [[1945]] "[[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]" (Victory over Japan Day) when the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrendered]] by signing the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]].

On [[October 27]], [[1945]], the 65th Infantry, which had participated in the battles of [[Naples]]-Fogis, [[Rome]]-Arno, [[central Europe]] and of the [[Rhineland]], sailed home from France. Arriving at Puerto Rico on [[November 9]], [[1945]], they were received by the local population as national heroes and given a victorious reception at the Military Terminal of Camp Buchanan. The 295th Regiment returned on [[February 20]], [[1946]] from the Panama Canal Zone, and the 296th Regiment on [[March 6]]. Both regiments were awarded the American Theatre streamer (The 295th was also awarded the Pacific Theatre streamer) and were inactivated that same year.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18

Others, such as Major General Juan Cesar Cordero Davila, Colonel Carlos Betances Ramirez, Sergeant First Class Agustin Ramos Calero and [[Pedro Rodriguez (soldier)|Master Sergeant Pedro Rodriguez]], continued in the military as career soldiers and went on to serve in the [[Korean War]].

Some of the Puerto Ricans from the mainland who had not completed their full active duty in the military service were reassigned to the 65th Infantry in Puerto Rico. According to remarks made by Frank Bonilla in an interview, he discovered that there was a divide among the soldiers. The Puerto Ricans who had emigrated to the mainland were seen as <U+201C>American Joes.<U+201D> while Puerto Ricans from the island considered themselves <U+201C>pure<U+201D> Puerto Ricans. Bonilla is quoted as saying: <blockquote>"The Puerto Rican soldiers paid little, if any, attention to the playing of the '[[The Star-Spangled Banner|Star Spangled Banner]]"; Bonilla at first thought the soldiers were being disrespectful to the United States, especially since they stood at attention whenever <U+201C>[[La Borinque<U+00F1>a]],<U+201D> the Puerto Rican anthem, was played. <U+201C>The soldiers in the regiment, although proud to be U.S. citizens, felt that they were a Puerto Rican army, not a US army,<U+201D> Mr. Bonilla said. <U+201C>These men had a select unit pride because they had had more time overseas and in combat areas than the American units.<U+201D><ref name="Bonilla"/></blockquote>Bonilla eventually earned a Ph.D. from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and held faculty appointments at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[City University of New York]]. He became a major leader in Puerto Rican studies.<ref name="Bonilla">{{cite web |accessdate=2007-03-18 |url= http://utopia.utexas.edu/explore/latino/narratives/08bonilla_frank.html |title=Frank Bonilla became major figure in Puerto Rican studies |author=Anne Quach | publisher= Utopia: U.S. Latinos and Latinas & WWII Oral History Project}}</ref>

According to the 4th Report of the Director of Selective Service of 1948, a total of 51,438 Puerto Ricans served in the Armed Forces during World War II. These numbers only reflect those who served in Puerto Rican units. However, the total number of Puerto Ricans who served in World War II in other units cannot be determined because the military categorized Hispanics along with whites. The only racial groups for which separate statistic kept were Blacks and [[Asian American|Asians]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18|url=http://www.army.mil/cmh/documents/WWII/minst.htm
