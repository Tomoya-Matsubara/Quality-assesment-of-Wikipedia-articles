Electronic Arts often acquires new companies to expand or add to new product lines. For instance, EA [[Chairman]] and [[Chief Executive Officer]] [[Larry Probst]] said after the acquisition of [[JAMDAT Mobile]] that "we intend to build a leading global position in the [...] business of providing games on mobile phones".<ref name="jamdat"/> EA followed through with this later, making the company into [[EA Mobile]], and allowing people to purchase and download content produced by them directly onto their phones.<ref name="reuters"/> After the acquisition of [[Origin Systems]], some staff in that company claimed that Electronic Arts initially gave them more resources, but allowed little lattitude if employees made a mistake, and in some cases no longer trusted them, and even worked against them.<ref name="escapist2">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-03|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_14/87-The-Conquest-of-Origin.2|title=The Conquest of Origin pg. 2|publisher=Escapist|date=2005-10-11}}</ref><ref name="escapist">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-03|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_14/87-The-Conquest-of-Origin.3|title=The Conquest of Origin pg. 3|publisher=Escapist|date=2005-10-11}}</ref> EA has shut down studios of companies after acquiring them, including [[EA Digital Illusions CE|DICE Canada]] and [[Origin Systems]].<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-03|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6159448.html|title=EA shuts down DICE Canada|publisher=Gamespot|date=2006-10-06|author=Brendan Sinclair}}</ref><ref name="gamepro">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-03|url=http://www.gamepro.com.au/index.php/id;476539124;fp;4;fpid;4|title=EA to Shut Down Origin Systems|publisher=Gamepro|date=2004-02-25}}</ref> Gaming blogger [[Brian Crecente]] has said that fears that EA doesn't care about the quality of their products after they are acquired are debatable.<ref name="cnet">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-03|url=http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9796120-7.html|title=Electronic Arts pays $860 million for BioWare, Pandemic Studios|publisher=CNET|date=2007-10-11|author=Caroline McCarthy}}</ref>

As of April 2008, Electronic Arts' largest acquisition is the purchase of VG Holding Corp., the owner of [[video game developers]] [[Bioware]] and [[Pandemic Studios]], for $775&nbsp;million. Of the 26 companies acquired by EA, 15 are based in the U.S., three in the United Kingdom, five in [[Continental Europe]], and three elsewhere.

Each acquisition listed is for the entire company. The [[acquisition]] date listed is the date of the agreement between [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) and the subject of the acquisition. The value of each acquisition is listed in U.S. dollars, because EA is headquartered in the U.S. If the value of the acquisition is not listed, then it is undisclosed. If the EA service that is derived from the acquired company is known, then it is also listed.
