'''Nikita''' is the primary protagonist and eponymous character of ''[[Nikita (TV series)|Nikita]]'', an American action and drama television series, which debuted in September&nbsp;2010 on [[The CW Television Network]]. She is played by American actress [[Maggie Q]]. The series follows Nikita's efforts in bringing down Division, a secret agency that trained her into becoming an agent and assassin, and then betrayed her by killing a man she fell in love with, civilian Daniel Monroe. She recruits [[Alexandra Udinov]] ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]) into helping her destroy Division from within.

Q was in talks to appear on the series as the title character in February 2010, and it was her first time working on a television series. She was chosen for the role because series creator Craig Silverstein believed Q had qualities that would fit the character; "beautiful, who could fight," and be believable with a gun. The actress meanwhile was intrigued by the [[Nikita (film)|original ''Nikita'' film]] and [[Luc Besson]]'s creation of a flawed female character. Q performs her own stunts of the series. The series also deals with Nikita and [[Michael (Nikita)|Michael]]'s romantic tension, then relationship, described by the fans as "Mikita." The character and Q's portrayal garnered generally positive reactions from critics.

==Characterization==
===Creation and casting===
[[File:MaggieQSDCCJuly10.jpg|upright|thumb|Maggie Q plays the series' eponymous character. It was the actress' first role in television.]]
[[The CW Television Network|The CW]] was looking to create a female-driven action series. Creator Craig Silverstein discussed with [[Warner Bros.]] about the previous incarnations of Nikita ([[Nikita (film)|the original 1990 film]], and ''[[La Femme Nikita]]'') and wished to make the current television series look fresh. Silverstein wanted to follow Nikita after she left the agency, as that chapter was yet to be told in the previous incarnations. He also believed it would have done the original story justice. Also, he wanted to include a highlight of Nikita's original story in the pilot to earn the title, and then move on from there. Silverstein described Nikita's transition in a Collider interview; "It's a dark fairytale. This girl is taken from one life, her identity is erased, she's put in another life and she's transformed. It's like ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. She's told, "Eat this, drink that, steal this, kill that," and she's not told why. And, she begins to find her own identity through that. It's just a great story."<ref name=collider2/>

On February&nbsp;2010 it was announced that Maggie&nbsp;Q was in talks to play the title character of ''Nikita''. Q's casting would mark the highest-profile series role for an Asian actress on a broadcast drama series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/19/us-maggie-idUSTRE61I14O20100219 |title=Maggie Q to star as CW's "Nikita" remake |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |work=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]}}</ref> Q was drawn to the series because she was intrigued by the [[Nikita (film)|original film]] and [[Luc Besson]]'s creation of an incredibly flawed female. According to the actress the process of her casting took about four to five days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/09/18/nikita-maggie-q-interview/ |title='Nikita' star Maggie Q talks her new hit series, kicking butt, and being a Jackie Chan protege |first=Tim |last=Stack |date=September 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}</ref> In describing Q's casting, Silverstein stated;

{{cquote|Before we knew who Nikita was going to be, we all talked about how impossible it was going to be to cast this role. It had to be someone who was beautiful, who could fight, who you could believe holding a gun and who you believed was smart, in order to plan everything that she was doing. You'd think those things would be easy to find in an actor, and they're not. We had actors come in and these girls would be gorgeous and smart, but you'd put a gun in their hands and it didn't work. The second we heard Maggie's name, Danny Cannon, our director, and I looked at each other and were like, "Yes!" It was really early on in the process.|200|50|Craig Silverstein<ref name=collider2>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/executive-producer-craig-silverstein-interview-nikita/46240/ |title=Executive Producer Craig Silverstein Interview NIKITA |first=Christina |last=Radish |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |publisher=Collider}}</ref>}}

Appearing on Nikita would be Q's first television role. During an interview with [[IGN]], Q explained that she previously was not on television "not because I didn't want to. I just never thought about it," adding "When this came up, everything just felt right. I knew McG and when Wonderland came on he was like, 'This is you, we're not doing this without you.' and I went 'That's very sweet!' So it felt right."<ref name=ign>{{cite web |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/110/1101592p1.html |title=Nikita is Ready to Kill |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |work=''[[IGN]]'' |publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref>

===Development===
Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, there were times Nikita had to be dressed in a certain way to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, but at the same time wanted Nikita's dress sense to be "toned down a bit" because she is an assassin. In one scene in particular Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which "mortified" her. She added "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'"<ref name=collider/> However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.<ref name=collider/>

Q performs her own stunts in the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s126/nikita/news/a266170/maggie-q-performs-own-nikita-stunts.html |title=Maggie Q 'performs own Nikita stunts' |first=Morgan |last=Jeffrey |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=''[[Digital Spy]]'' |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias]]}}</ref> The actress liked to have her character "be able to do her own thing," as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to take a step back and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing."<ref name=ign/> At some point Q set up a three-week long training period for the rest of the cast to make their fight scenes on the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.<ref name=collider>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/maggie-q-interview-nikita/45906/ |title=Maggie Q Interview NIKITA |first=Christina |last=Radish |date=August 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |publisher=Collider}}</ref>

One of the more prominent aspects of Nikita's character development since the beginning of the series is her relationship with Michael,<ref name=eonline>{{cite web |url=http://eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b206817_can_romance_ever_really_blossom_on.html |title=Can Romance Ever Really Blossom on Nikita? |first=Breanne L. |last=Heldman |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=June 28, 2011 |work=''[[E!

==Reception==
{{Quote box
 | quote  = "Q gives the impression of trying to get things over in a businesslike fashion. In the action scenes, this is quite effective. In all other scenes, this is merely effective. It's as if she has made a choice to play the character with a pronounced detachment. Or perhaps, deciding to keep her bad acting low key, she has arrived at a decent approximation of bare competence, which is one way to do it, but what am I prattling about? As ubiquitous bus-shelter ads attest, Q looks confident holding a gun and is not averse to wearing either leather or lace, thus meeting the maximum requirements for the job."

Nikita and Maggie Q's portrayal of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Alessandra Stanley of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that Q was suited for the role, stating "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," adding "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by [[Jennifer Garner]] on ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', or the C.I.A. rookie that [[Piper Perabo]] plays on ''[[Covert Affairs]]''."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/arts/television/08nikita.html?_r=1 |title=Lethal Woman With Weapons Is Out for Covert Vengeance |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Troy Patterson of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' felt that "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman's]]'' [[Jaime Sommers (Bionic Woman)|Jaime Sommers]] or ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse's]]'' what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty."<ref name=slate>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2266739/ |title=The post-racial America of Hellcats; the posters of Nikita |first=Troy |last=Patterson |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]}}</ref> Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' believed Q's performance was "a fairly sizable incentive" to watch the show, adding she "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered at the hands of evil men, and she's not going to take it anymore."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2010-09-09-nikita09_ST_N.htm |title='Nikita' star Maggie Q brings killer looks to killer role |first=Robert |last=Bianco |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]}}</ref> Alan Sepinwall of [[HitFix]] believed that Q "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/review-nikita-on-the-cw |title=Review: 'Nikita' on the CW |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |publisher=[[HitFix]]}}</ref> Maureen Ryan of [[AOL TV]] said "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown.

Some other critics however, did not react so warmly towards Nikita. Chris Conaton of [[PopMatters]] felt that Q "seems to be a good choice for the title role," but noted that the pilot did not call attention to the character's background. That said Conaton stated "it's still something of a novelty to build a TV series around an Asian American lead<U+2014>though plenty of recent ensemble and reality TV shows have featured prominent cast members of Asian descent."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/130750-nikita/ |title='Nikita': Spies Like Them |first=Chris |last=Conaton |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |publisher=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' flet that Q was "too much of a sad sack," adding "Q doesn't seem able to layer any other emotions over her cold resolve," and compares the character to "a little bit like [''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' character] [[Debbie Downer]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.boston.com/2010-09-09/ae/29326475_1_nikita-jaden-lyndsy-fonseca |title=A mysterious assassin <U+2014> minus the mystery |first=Matthew |last=Gilbert |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Mary McNamara of The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' believed that while Nikita does "provides some sizzle," her emotions "run that famous distance from A to B, as do virtually [every other characters]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/08/entertainment/la-et-hellcatsnikita-20100908 |title=Television Review: 'Hellcats' and 'Nikita' on the CW |first=Mary |last=McNamara |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}</ref>

Before the show started airing, Q posed for several billboard posters. However, they were met with some controversy for being revealing, and several locations across the United States, including in areas of [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York]], refused to allow them to be put up, as they were located near churches and schools. Rick Haskins, the marketing executive for the CW stated "we've been down this road a few times with some of our campaigns."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s126/nikita/news/a264835/nikita-campaign-causes-controversy.html |title='Nikita' campaign causes controversy |first=Morgan |last=Jeffery |date=August 20, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |work=''[[Digital Spy]]'' |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias]]}}</ref>
