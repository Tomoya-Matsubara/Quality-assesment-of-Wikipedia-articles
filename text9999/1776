The '''Chapel Royal''' is an 18th-century place of worship in the centre of [[Brighton]], part of the [[England|English]] city of [[Brighton and Hove]]. Built as a [[chapel of ease]], it became one of Brighton's most important churches, gaining its own parish and becoming closely associated with the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] and fashionable [[British Regency|Regency-era]] society. It no longer has a parish of its own, but services are still held there.

==History==
In the 18th century, Brighton was a small town based on a declining fishing industry and still suffering the effects of damage caused by the [[Great Storm of 1703]]. Its population in the middle of the century was approximately 2,000.<ref name="EncycB-s17(e)">{{cite book|last=Carder|first=Timothy|year=1990|title=The Encyclopedia of Brighton|pages=s.17(e)|publisher=East Sussex County Libraries|id=ISBN 0-86147-315-9}}</ref> Its fortunes improved after a doctor from nearby [[Lewes]], [[Richard Russell (doctor)|Richard Russell]], wrote a treatise encouraging the use of seawater as a cure for illness, in particular [[gland]]ular swellings. He recommended bathing in the sea and drinking the water at Brighton. This form of medical therapy became popular, and helped make the town a fashionable place to visit.<ref name="ODNB-RR">John H.

Retrieved [[8 August]] [[2008]].</ref> Brighton became increasingly popular throughout the rest of the century, but received its next significant boost when the Prince Regent, son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], made his first visit in 1783.<ref name="Dale23">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p23 }}</ref> By 1786 he had a home in the town<U+2014>a rented farmhouse near the Old Steine, inland from the coast<U+2014>and he later commissioned the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] to build a palace, the [[Royal Pavilion]], for him on the site. The Prince was an infrequent churchgoer, and Brighton's only [[Church of England|Anglican]] church, [[St Nicholas' Church, Brighton|St Nicholas]], was a long way from his home and up a steep hill. Furthermore, the ever-increasing number of visitors and residents caused overcrowding in the church. In 1789 the new Vicar of Brighton, Revd Thomas Hudson, decided to resolve these problems by building a new chapel near the Prince's house. He hoped to encourage the Prince to attend, and thereby worship more often than he had in the past, and considered that a more central chapel would relieve the pressure on the parish church.<ref name="Dale23"/><ref name="IoEChapelRoyal">{{cite web|title=Images of England <U+2014> detailed record, The Chapel Royal, North Street (north side), Brighton|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=480948&mode=quick|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref>

The Prince was happy with the arrangement, agreeing to rent a [[pew]] and lay the [[cornerstone|foundation stone]]. A ceremony took place on [[25 November]] [[1793]]<ref name="Dale23"/><ref name="IoEChapelRoyal"/> at the corner of North Street and the newly built and named Prince's Place. Construction work, overseen by a builder named Bodle and to the design of London-based architect Thomas Saunders, lasted a year.<ref name="Dale23"/> The Prince and his wife of four months, [[Caroline of Brunswick]], attended the inaugural service on [[3 August]] [[1795]].<ref name="Dale23"/><ref name="IoEChapelRoyal"/>

Revd Hudson owned and ran the chapel himself at first, opening it only during the peak seasons when Brighton was at its busiest. In 1803 it became the official [[chapel of ease]] to St Nicholas' Church when he obtained a private [[Act of Parliament]] formalising this.<ref name="Dale25">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p25 }}</ref> Among other things, this Act allowed Hudson, in his position as Vicar of Brighton, and his successors in that role, to appoint a [[Curate|perpetual curate]] for the chapel, and to fund a [[stipend]] of <U+00A3>115 (at 1803 prices) by the rental of pews. Of the pew spaces in the church, only 224 had to be provided free<U+2014>the others could be "auctioned"<U+2014>and visitors with no pew of their own could be charged an admission fee of [[Shilling|1/-]]. In return, the curate's responsibilities included paying for a clerk and the sacramental bread and [[Sacramental wine|wine]] used at [[Eucharist|Communion]], and funding maintenance of the building. Many later chapels of ease in Brighton and Hove had similar Acts passed for them, imposing similar conditions.<ref name="Dale26">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p26 }}</ref>

[[Image:Former Holy Trinity Church, Brighton.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holy Trinity Church, Brighton|Holy Trinity Church]] came close on three occasions to being included within the Chapel Royal's parish; when it closed, its congregation transferred to the Chapel Royal.]]
Soon after becoming a formal chapel of ease, the Chapel Royal was consecrated by the [[Bishop of Chichester]], [[John Buckner]]. However, by that date ([[16 August]] [[1803]]), the Prince Regent was no longer worshipping there. His attendance became infrequent soon after the chapel was built, and he eventually stopped worshipping there when a sermon, said to have been on the topic of immorality, offended him.<ref name="IoEChapelRoyal"/><ref name="Dale26"/><ref name="Roughwood-ChapelRoyal">{{cite web|title=Chapel Royal, North Street, Brighton, Sussex|url=http://www.roughwood.net/ChurchAlbum/EastSussex/Brighton/BrightonChapelRoyal2005.htm|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=Mark Collins|date=2005-04-27|work=The Roughwood website}}</ref> (Sources differ on who preached the sermon,<ref name="Dale26"/><ref name="Roughwood-ChapelRoyal"/> thought to have been entitled "Thou art the man".)<ref name="Dale26"/> Other members of the Royal Family occasionally visited the chapel later, however; the last recorded attendance was by [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta Sophia]], the Prince Regent's sister, in 1840.<ref name="Dale26"/> Later in the 19th century, two future British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]] were regular worshippers at the chapel. [[William Gladstone]] attended whenever he visited Brighton, and [[Winston Churchill]] attended between 1883 and 1885 when he was a pupil at a local school.<ref name="IoEChapelRoyal"/>

The ownership of the chapel passed to various curates until Revd Thomas Trocke, formerly of St Nicholas' Church, became perpetual curate in 1834. He stayed until his retirement in 1875, seeing the chapel taking charge of its own district for the first time in 1873 when the parish structure in Brighton was reorganised. The building was closed for eight months in 1876 and 1877 for internal structural repairs and reordering. Architect [[Arthur Blomfield]] was responsible for the changes, which cost <U+00A3>2,700.<ref name="Dale27">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p27 }}</ref> Soon afterwards, in 1880, demolition of houses facing North Street revealed the southern face of the chapel for the first time: until then, only the east elevation (facing Prince's Place) could be seen. Blomfield produced a design for a completely new exterior, including a tower in the southeast corner at the junction of the two streets. The work was completed in two parts<U+2014>the new south face first, then the remodelled east elevation in 1896<U+2014>and cost <U+00A3>1,200.<ref name="Dale27"/>

The chapel gained its own full parish for the first time in 1896, at which point the ownership of the church was transferred to the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]]. By this time, however, the residential population of central Brighton was declining rapidly as the streets making up the parish became more commerce<U+2013> and retail<U+2013>focused. Three proposals had been made by 1930 to incorporate the unparished [[Holy Trinity Church, Brighton|Holy Trinity Church]] in nearby Ship Street into the Chapel Royal's parish, in order to expand it and make it more viable. These were all resisted, however, and by the mid-20th century the local population was so low that the parish was instead merged with that of [[St Peter's Church, Brighton|St Peter's Church]] at the top of Old Steine.<ref name="Dale29">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p29 }}</ref> Services became irregular, and one aisle of the chapel was converted into a Christian bookshop. However, the closure of the Holy Trinity church in 1984 resulted in additional services being provided for the displaced congregation,<ref name="Dale30">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p30 }}</ref> and a regular schedule of services is now in operation.<ref name="ACNY-CR">{{cite web|title=The Chapel Royal, Brighton|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/venue.php?V=4804|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=Oxford Diocesan Publications Ltd|year=2007|work=A Church Near You website}}</ref> Alterations and a reconfiguration of the church interior in the bicentennial year (1995) completed the transition from a parish church, focusing on the population of a specific locality, to a "city church" open to the whole community and meeting the spiritual needs of the permanent and transient population of Brighton.<ref name="CR-War">{{cite web|title=Chapel Royal: History<U+2014>War and Renewal|url=http://www.crbr.org/building/war.asp|accessdate=2008-08-08|year=2008|work=The Chapel Royal website}}</ref>

==Architecture==
The original chapel was a [[stucco]]ed building in a broadly [[Classical architecture|Classical style]], with rounded [[sash window]]s and a [[pediment]] with the Prince's [[coat of arms]]. A row of [[Doric order|Doric columns]] flanked the entrance.<ref name="Dale23"/> Inside there were galleries on each wall, supported by decorated columns. The gallery above the altar contained the [[organ (music)|organ]], and there was a tall, highly decorated [[pulpit]].<ref name="Dale24">{{cite book |last=Dale |first=Antony |title=Brighton Churches |origyear=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=London EC4 |isbn=0-415-00863-8 |pages=p24 }}</ref> The alterations of 1876<U+2013>1877 removed the gallery above the altar and added a [[chancel]], separated from the [[nave]] by an iron [[rood screen]], new pulpit and [[lectern]].<ref name="Dale27"/>

The rebuilding of the exterior in 1882<U+2013>1883 (south elevation) and 1896 (east elevation),<ref name="IoEChapelRoyal"/> prompted by the demolition of buildings adjacent to the south side of the chapel to allow North Street to be widened, involved replacing the stucco with red brick, enlarging the pediment and giving the new south elevation a similar appearance.<ref name="Dale27"/> It is neither as tall nor as long as the east side (facing Prince's Place), and has no pediment, but was otherwise very similar until the alterations of 1995 changed the entrance area and added more glass to make more of the interior visible from the street. The most significant feature of Arthur Blomfield's work on the exterior was the tall, red-brick clock tower.<ref name="Dale27"/> This has some [[flint]]work and a [[hip roof|hipped]] [[slate]] roof. The tower has four clock faces, each in a [[terracotta]] insert.<ref name="IoEChapelRoyal"/>
