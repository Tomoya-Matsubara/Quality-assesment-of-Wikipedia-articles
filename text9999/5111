'''George Washington Memorial Park''' is located at the center of [[Jackson, Wyoming]]. More generally known as "Town Square", the park is notable for its [[elk]]-[[antler]] arches at each corner of the park, collected from the nearby [[National Elk Refuge]] by [[Boy Scouts|boy scouts]] and periodically rebuilt. The park existed as an open space in the center of town that was made into a park in 1934. The park center also contains a stone memorial to [[John Colter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/NationalRegister/site.asp|date=2008-08-12|work=National Register of Historic Places|title=George Washington Memorial Park|publisher=Wyoming State Preservation Office}}</ref>
