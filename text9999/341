{{nihongo|'''''School Rumble'''''|<U+30B9><U+30AF><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+30E9><U+30F3><U+30D6><U+30EB>|Suk<U+016B>ru Ramburu}} is a Japanese [[Sh<U+014D>nen manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Jin Kobayashi]]. First serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh<U+014D>nen Magazine]]'' from October 22, 2002 to July 23, 2008, all 283 chapters were later collected in 22 ''[[tank<U+014D>bon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]]. ''Sh<U+014D>nen Magazine Special'' published a sequel, ''School Rumble Z'', monthly from August 20, 2008 to May 20, 2009. A [[romance comedy]] centering on relationships between [[Education in Japan#High school|Japanese high school]] students, ''School Rumble'' focuses on a [[love triangle]] involving the series' two [[protagonist]]s, [[List of School Rumble characters#Harima|Kenji Harima]] and [[List of School Rumble characters#Tenma|Tenma Tsukamoto]], and one of their classmates, [[List of School Rumble characters#Oji Karasuma|Oji Karasuma]]. The series often discards realism in favor of comedic effect.

''School Rumble''{{'}}s popularity has resulted in its adaption into multiple forms of media. [[TV Tokyo]] broadcast a 26-episode [[anime]] program between October 2004 and April 2005. In December 2005, a two-part [[original video animation]] (OVA) entitled ''School Rumble: Extra Class'' was released. A second season, ''School Rumble: 2nd Semester'', aired between April and September 2006. Finally, two more episodes, collectively entitled ''School Rumble: Third Semester'', were bundled with the Japanese manga volumes 21 and 22. Three [[video game]]s have been produced<U+2014>two for the {{nowrap|[[PlayStation 2]]}} in July 2005 and July 2006, and one for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2005. Two light novels written by Hiroko Tokita and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi were published in April 2004 and December 2007; four official guidebooks written and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi have also been released.

[[Del Rey Manga]] publishes the English translation of ''School Rumble''. In the translation, Del Rey Manga maintained the traditional Japanese name order<ref group=n>In Japan, [[family name]] is listed first followed by a [[given name]]. Japanese traditionally do not have [[middle name]]s.</ref> to preserve [[pun]]s based on the characters' names. [[Funimation Entertainment]] published the first and second anime seasons and the ''Extra Class'' OVAs in English. ''School Rumble'' has been translated into additional languages, although the final two episodes, the video games, and guidebooks have yet to be released outside Japan.

The manga was well received by Japanese-language readers; several volumes have appeared in the top manga sales charts. The North American English translations were less popular, but still ranked several times in the top 100 as well as ranking 145th for overall manga series sales in 2008. Critics of the English-language translation have been positive overall, praising Kobayashi for his art style and overall use of humor. However, the manga has received some criticism, mostly centered around some of the jokes and repetitive plot. The anime adaptation also sold well in Japan and was praised by Kobayashi and<U+2014>for the English-language translation<U+2014>critics. The decision by [[Media Factory]] to aggressively pursue its [[intellectual property rights]] for ''School Rumble'' is believed to have had a negative impact on the franchise's release and sales in the [[North America]]n market.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of School Rumble characters}}

''School Rumble'' is a romantic comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, as well as their friends and families. The main female [[protagonist]] is [[List of School Rumble characters#Tenma|Tenma Tsukamoto]], an unremarkable second-year high school student<ref>{{cite video|date=October 5, 2004|title=School Rumble: The New School Year!

He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in [[curry]]. The main male protagonist, [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] [[List of School Rumble characters#Harima|Kenji Harima]], similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her.<ref>{{cite video|people=Lisa Marie|title=Anime Today Interviews Astro Boy Director Fred Ladd!|url=http://media-alt.rightstuf.com/podcast/animetoday/05/animetoday052.mp3|accessdate=May 6, 2009|time=40:17 - 40:34}}</ref> Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.<ref>{{cite video|people=Lisa Marie|title=Anime Today Interviews Astro Boy Director Fred Ladd!|url=http://media-alt.rightstuf.com/podcast/animetoday/05/animetoday052.mp3|accessdate=May 6, 2009|time=40:47 - 40:53}}</ref>

Harima complicates the [[love triangle]] through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, [[List of School Rumble characters#Eri Sawachika|Eri Sawachika]], after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, [[List of School Rumble characters#Yakumo|Yakumo Tsukamoto]], who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, [[List of School Rumble characters#Haruki Hanai|Haruki Hanai]], who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared [[surname]] causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations.<ref group="n">Japanese often address each other by their surname unless they are in a close relationship, such as with a long time friend, relative, or spouse.</ref> Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.

Although ''School Rumble'' focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends [[List of School Rumble characters#Mikoto Suo|Mikoto Suo]], who runs a [[kenp<U+014D>]] [[dojo]] where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and [[List of School Rumble characters#Akira Takano|Akira Takano]], a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.

<!--The scene with Eri and Harima is an imaginary scene of what one of the characters would like to see in the future. Nothing more.-->The series ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, the status of his relationship with Yakumo is uncertain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kobayashi|first1=Jin|authorlink1=Jin Kobayashi|title=School Rumble Z|year=2009|month=June|publisher=Kodansha|location=Japan|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-06-384155-8}}</ref>

==Development and production==
[[Jin Kobayashi]] began writing ''School Rumble'', his debut work, in 2002.<ref group=n>In an interview with Kaori Shimizu, Jin Kobayashi notes he started writing ''School Rumble'' four years previously.

However, despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters, he stated that [[List of School Rumble characters#Ryuuhei Suga|Ryuuhei Suga]], a minor supporting character, is the most autobiographical.<ref name="ANN Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2005/6th-comic-exhibition@taipei-taiwan/5|title=Interview: Jin Kobayashi|work=News|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|first=Chih-Chieh|last=Chang|date=September 1, 2005|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|title=School Rumble: 2nd Semester - The Complete Box Set ~ Interview with the Creator|time=12:30-12:57, 13:38-14:04}}</ref> Most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates;<ref name="Yadao Interview">{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/08/13/features/story04.html|title=Manga spins unique yarn of love|page=1|work=DRAWN & QUARTERED|publisher=[[Star Bulletin]]|first=Jason S.|last=Yadao|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> Kobayashi recalled that he had no real idea of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until much later, when he heard the voice actors' (''[[seiy<U+016B>]]'') interpretations during the production of the anime series, that he knew how they should sound.<ref>{{cite video|title=School Rumble: 2nd Semester - The Complete Box Set ~ Interview with the Creator|time=7:19-7:41}}</ref> He acknowledged that some characters are more developed than others; in reply to a fan question about the mysterious Akira Takano, he admitted that, despite the closeness he feels for her, he did not put much emphasis on Takano and planned to develop her love-life slowly. Kobayashi intentionally centered his story arcs around misunderstandings which he then resolves, since he believes "if there's no misunderstanding then there's no funny story."<ref name="ANN Interview"/> He claims that none of his stories are based on real-life events, although when pressed admits the possibility of some resemblances but without divulging specific details.<ref>{{cite video|title=School Rumble: 2nd Semester - The Complete Box Set ~ Interview with the Creator|time=12:00-12:30, 14:05-14:48}}</ref>

Kobayashi and his editor collaborated on the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the basic illustrations for each chapter before passing his material to assistants to finish.<ref>{{cite video|title=School Rumble: 2nd Semester - The Complete Box Set ~ Interview with the Creator|time=24:08-24:58}}</ref> As the series' ''[[mangaka]]'', Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume's front cover was to feature Akira Takano,, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since much of its plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she should be on the cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima on the cover of volume six.<ref name="Yadao Interview P2">{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/08/13/features/story04b.html|title=Manga spins unique yarn of love|page=2|work=DRAWN & QUARTERED|publisher=[[Star Bulletin]]|first=Jason S.|last=Yadao|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of ''School Rumble Z''.<ref name="School Rumble Z Ends">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-05-20/school-rumble-z-manga-ends-in-japan |title=School Rumble Z Manga Ends |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref>

An anime adaption of the series was never envisaged by Kobayashi, and he was skeptical of the project when first approached. Negotiations and preparation took some time, but he claims to be happy with the end result.<ref>{{cite video|title=School Rumble: 2nd Semester - The Complete Box Set ~ Interview with the Creator|time=5:19-6:02}}</ref> On viewing the first anime footage, Kobayashi was astonished; he recalls in an interview his emotions at the time, stating "I was incredibly touched by it. Completely overcome."<ref>{{cite video|title=School Rumble: 2nd Semester - The Complete Box Set ~ Interview with the Creator|time=6:11-6:18}}</ref> Impressed with the adaptation of his work, he praises the anime staff for their achievement, although conceding that ''School Rumble'' probably lent itself to the anime format.<ref name="Yadao Interview"/><ref>{{cite video|title=School Rumble: 2nd Semester - The Complete Box Set ~ Interview with the Creator|time=6:23-6:59}}</ref> He cites the fishing episode, for which he supplied the voice acting for several minor parts, as his favorite.<ref group=n>The episode is 25 of ''School Rumble: First Semester''.

The anime's first season focuses on Harima, Karasuma, and Tenma, and Harima's relationships with other females including Sawachika and Yakumo. Its second season involves more of the secondary cast. The ''Extra Class'' OVAs are compiled from various first season storylines. Both the ''Third Semester'' synopses and episodes return to the main cast.

One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode&nbsp;2 of season one. She notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase's inherent humor, those familiar with ''[[Initial D]]'' will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference.

==Reception==
===Manga series===
Although generally well-received, the manga has also attracted some criticism. Eduardo M. Chavez, of Mania.com, recalls being initially put off by the title, which for him conjured images of battles more physical than emotional. After glancing through the first volume, he was surprised to find his assumption wrong, and concluded that it was appropriately named. While he gives a largely positive review, Chavez finds the series' artwork "simple" and unimpressive.<ref name="GN1R">{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-vol-01_article_82537.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #01|work=Anime/Manga Review|publisher=Mania.com|first=Eduardo M.|last=Chavez|date=March 7, 2006|accessdate=June 12, 2009}}</ref> He notes that the first volume becomes slightly repetitive, so praises the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second, bringing variety to the setting. Remarking on Kobayashi's ability to draw on numerous influences, Chavez applauds the ''mangaka'' for finding fresh ways of using old themes, preventing ''School Rumble'' from becoming derivative. He reserves his highest praise for the "flat" chapters dealing with Yakumo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-vol-02_article_82538.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #02|work=Anime/Manga Review|publisher=Mania.com|first=Eduardo M.|last=Chavez|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=June 12, 2009}}</ref> In the next two volumes Chavez approves of the mixture of comedy and romance and the way the characters "grow up", although acknowledging that while the manga's style suits his personal preferences it will not be not to everyone's taste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-vol-03_article_82719.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #03|work=Anime/Manga Review|publisher=Mania.com|first=Eduardo M.|last=Chavez|date=October 11, 2006|accessdate=June 12, 2009}}<p>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-vol-04_article_82918.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #04|work=Anime/Manga Review|publisher=Mania.com|first=Eduardo M.|last=Chavez|date=March 7, 2007|accessdate=June 12, 2009}}</ref>

Chavez praised Del Rey's translation for retaining the manga's original identity; the header, bumper artwork, character biographies, and front covers are all but identical to the Japanese.<ref name="GN1R"/> Eries also thanked Del Rey's translation notes for clearing up some misconceptions for her,<ref name="GN6R"/> although she later concluded that their quality has deteriorated as the series progresses.<ref name="GN11R"/><ref name="GN10R"/>

===Anime series===
Like the manga, the anime has been well received but does not avoid criticism; in particular the quality of the animation for both seasons, including the OVAs, has attracted mixed reviews. Some of the humor and romantic elements have been derided while the English dubbing and soundtrack have been universally praised. Most reviewers took the position that, even if they dislike certain elements, the series as a whole contains something that makes them want to see more; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, who writes:
<blockquote>
The stories are really quite simple as well as being things we've seen done dozens of times before. Yet it manages to infuse it with a great deal of fun and humor even if it is familiar. There's a certain energy here that works in the shows {{sic}} favor as well as bringing in some different elements in terms of the characters. It also doesn't hurt that several of the characters really are quite dim which is a nice contrast from the usual kind of leads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-vol-5_article_79946.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #5|work=Anime/Mange Reviews|publisher=Mania.com|first=Chris|last=Beveridge|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref>

Beveridge cautioned that because the anime was designed around the non-linear format of the manga, its transitions might at first be troublesome for the viewer,<ref name="Beveridge1"/> but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-vol-6_article_80082.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #6|work=Anime/Mange Reviews|publisher=Mania.com|first=Chris|last=Beveridge|date=March 31, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref>

While ''School Rumble'' is generally recognised as a [[sh<U+014D>nen manga|sh<U+014D>nen]] title targeting the young male market, Katherine Luther, staff reviewer for [[About.com]], refers to it as a [[sh<U+014D>jo manga|sh<U+014D>jo]] title aimed at girls and young women.<ref name="DVD1 Luther">{{cite web|url=http://anime.about.com/od/reviews/a/aa070107.htm|title=School Rumble: New Anime from FUNimation|first=Katherine|last=Luther|publisher=About.com|date=July 2, 2007|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref> Lisa Marie, reviewer for [[RightStuf]]'s ''Anime Today'' [[podcast]], agrees that others, notably males, might see the series as sh<U+014D>jo.<ref>{{cite video|people=Lisa Marie|title=ANIME TODAY Interviews Astro Boy Director Fred Ladd!|url=http://media-alt.rightstuf.com/podcast/animetoday/05/animetoday052.mp3|accessdate=May 6, 2009|time=45:19 <U+2013> 45:30}}</ref> Luther calls the first DVD "the perfect back-to-school accessory",<ref name="DVD1 Luther"/> while Marie characterizes ''School Rumble'' as "insane", asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like ''[[Excel Saga]]'' and ''[[Har<U+00E9> + Guu]]''.

Not all are of Japanese origin<U+2014>such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Star Wars: Return of the Jedi]]''<U+2014>giving the series broad appeal.<ref>{{cite video|people=Lisa Marie|title=ANIME TODAY Interviews Astro Boy Director Fred Ladd!|url=http://media-alt.rightstuf.com/podcast/animetoday/05/animetoday052.mp3|accessdate=May 6, 2009|time=41:55 <U+2013> 42:59}}</ref>

Anime News Network's reviewers found much to enjoy about the first series, although Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be "watched in small doses, as trying to tackle too much of it in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells".<ref name="Artbox Review"/> Carl Kimlinger comments that "from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... undiluted good times",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/school-rumble/dvd-3|title=School Rumble DVD 3 Review|last=Kimlinger|first=Carl|date=February 8, 2008|work=Review|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=June 4, 2009}}</ref> and that the title is "two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/school-rumble/dvd-4|title=School Rumble DVD 4 Review|last=Kimlinger|first=Carl|date=March 7, 2008|work=Review|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=March 9, 2008}}</ref> Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that "although this disc technically marks the end of [the first season of] ''School Rumble'', it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/school-rumble/dvd-6|title=School Rumble DVD 6 Review|last=Santos|first=Carlo|date=May 31, 2008|work=Review|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=March 9, 2008}}</ref> Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value,<ref name="Moure1"/> but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, foundhis early indifference fading as the story develops.<ref name="Moure2">{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-vol-2_article_80295.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #2|work=Anime/Mange Reviews|publisher=Mania.com|first=Dani|last=Moure|date=April 21, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}<p>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-season-1-box-set_article_80406.html|title=School Rumble Season 1 Box Set|work=Anime/Manga Revies|publisher=Mania.com|date=October 21, 2008|accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref> [[IGN]]'s Jeff Harris, N.S.

According to Theron Martin, the OVA series ''School Rumble: Extra Class'' was made mostly for devoted fans; claiming that familiarity with the series is almost a necessity before watching it, although he later came to the view that it may also be useful as a sampler of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/school-rumble-extra-class/dvd|title=School Rumble-Extra Class <U+2013> DVD|work=Review|publisher=Anime News Network|first=Theron|last=Martin|date=July 26, 2006|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review. He did not highlight a single specific reason, instead observing that although all elements that "make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here, they just feel weaker". However, it did make him want to watch more of the television series, thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/school-rumble-ova-extra-class_article_80318.html|title=School Rumble Vol. #3|work=Anime/Mange Reviews|publisher=Mania.com|first=Chris|last=Beveridge|date=June 13, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref> Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story, but reviewed the OVA positively. While she noted lulls in the action, she believes fans will be able to overlook this. Unlike Martin, Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to ''School Rumble'', due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anime.about.com/od/reviews/gr/srxtraclass.htm|title=School Rumble- Extra Class OVA|first=Katherine|last=Luther|publisher=About.com|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref>

Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network declined to post commentary on the preview announcement for the second season, claiming "we assume if you loved ''School Rumble'', you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2006-04-19|title=The Spring 2006 Anime Preview Guide|publisher=Anime News Network|first=Zac|last=Bertschy|date=April 19, 2006|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> David F.
