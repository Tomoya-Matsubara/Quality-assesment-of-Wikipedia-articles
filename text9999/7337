The '''Francisco Cabrera game''', played on October 14, 1992 at [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], was the last game of the [[1992 National League Championship Series]] between the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] and [[1992 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]].  Atlanta's dramatic three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth won the game and the [[National League]] pennant for the Braves.

==The season==
The Braves were attempting to return to the [[1991 World Series|World Series]] one year after their [[1991 World Series|dramatic]] seven-game loss to the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].  Atlanta featured largely the [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|same lineup]] that had won the 1991 pennant,<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/1991.shtml 1991 Braves stats]</ref><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/1992.shtml 1992 Braves stats]</ref>, but they still fell into a tie for last place, seven games behind the [[1992 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]], by the end of May.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=1992-05-27 Standings for May 27, 1992]</ref>  However, Atlanta went 19-6 in June and 16-9 in July and pulled away from the rest of the [[National League West|NL West]] by winning 15 of their first 18 games in August.  

The Pirates were in the [[1992 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] for the third year in a row after losing to the eventual World Series champion [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in [[1990 National League Championship Series|1990]] and the Braves in [[1991 National League Championship Series|1991]].  The Pirates lost slugging right fielder [[Bobby Bonilla]] to free agency after the 1991 season, replacing him with speedster [[Alex Cole]].  Ace pitcher [[John Smiley]] was traded to the [[1992 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].  Despite the departure of Smiley and Bonilla, Pittsburgh charged out to a seven-game lead by late June, suffered through an 11-15 July that allowed the [[1992 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] to tie them for the lead by the end of the month, then won eleven straight in early August before pulling away from the Expos in September to earn its third straight [[National League Eastern Division|NL East]] title.  Future home run champion [[Barry Bonds]] won his second [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]] and led the Pirates with 34 home runs and 103 RBI.

Pressure beyond the moment made it imperative for the Pirates to break through and win the pennant in 1992.  Financial demands had already resulted in losing Smiley and Bonilla, and the departure of pending free agents Bonds (left fielder) and [[Doug Drabek]] (starting pitcher) loomed.  1992 appeared to be the last chance for Pittsburgh to win with its current core of players.<ref name=fandn>[http://books.google.com/books?id=1VwOLIVOWvwC&pg=PA535&lpg=PA535&dq=francisco+cabrera+game&source=bl&ots=qi51wcgtpp&sig=t6NlctepaQMw7n2BkM1YVnl2WRk&hl=en&ei=dEcWTOrUJZn4MpGP4ZoL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=francisco%20cabrera%20game&f=false Finoli, David, and Bill Rainer.]  ''The Pittsburgh Pirates Encyclopedia''.  2003, Sports Publishing LLC, ISBN 9781582614168, pp. 534-535</ref>

==The series==
Smoltz dominated the Pirates in Game 1 and Atlanta won 5-1.  The Braves knocked [[Danny Jackson]] out of Game 2 in the second inning and went on to win 13-5.  Rookie [[Tim Wakefield]], who'd made his big league debut on July 31 and made thirteen starts for the Pirates,<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?n1=wakefti01&t=p&year=1992 Wakefield 1992 game log]</ref>, threw a complete game to win Game 3 for the Pirates by a 3-2 score.  In Game 4, the Braves chased Pirate ace [[Doug Drabek]] from the game in the fifth and won 6-4.  

Atlanta now led three games to one.  No team had lost a series that they led three games to once since the [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]] blew the [[1985 World Series]] against the [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]].  However, [[Steve Avery|Steve Avery's]] disastrous Game 5 start (1/3 of an inning pitched, 4 ER) led to a 7-1 Pittsburgh victory in Game 5, and the Pirates won Game 6 behind another complete game effort from Wakefield.

==The game==
Pittsburgh ace [[Doug Drabek]] faced off against [[John Smoltz]].  Cole led off the top of the first with a walk and scored on a sacrifice fly.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL199210140.shtml Box score and play-by-play.]  Source for all play-by-play information in this article.</ref>  In the second inning, 320-pound home plate umpire [[John McSherry]], feeling ill, called time and left the stadium.  [[Randy Marsh]] moved from first base to home plate.<ref name=si1992>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004373/1/index.htm "Unbelieveable"], [[Steve Rushin]], ''Sports Illustrated'', October 26, 1992</ref> Three and a half years later, seven pitches into [[1996 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]]'s 1996 [[Opening Day]] matchup against [[1996 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]], McSherry collapsed and died of a heart attack on the field.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007944/index.htm "Scorecard"], ''Sports Illustrated'', April 8, 1996</ref>

In the bottom of the third Atlanta catcher [[Damon Berryhill]] led off with a double but was stranded.  In the fifth [[Jose Lind]] of the Pirates doubled with one out but was stranded.  Pittsburgh struck for its second run in the sixth inning, when [[Jay Bell]] led off with a single and [[Andy Van Slyke]] doubled to bring him home.  In the bottom of that same inning the Braves wasted a golden opportunity.  [[Mark Lemke]] led off with a single, then [[Jeff Treadway]], pinch-hitting for Smoltz, followed with another single.  [[Otis Nixon|Otis Nixon's]] bunt single loaded the bases with nobody out.  However, [[Jeff Blauser|Jeff Blauser's]] line drive went straight to Pirate third baseman [[Jeff King (baseball)|Jeff King]], who caught it and doubled Lemke off of third base.  [[Terry Pendleton]] lined out to left to end the threat.

Both teams wasted further scoring chances in the seventh.  For the Pirates in the top of the inning, [[Mike LaValliere|Mike Lavalliere's]] leadoff single was followed by an intentional walk and an unintentional walk, bringing Van Slyke to the plate with the bases loaded and two out.  [[Steve Avery]] entered the game in relief and retired Van Slyke on a fly ball to center.  In the bottom of the seventh [[Sid Bream]] doubled with one out for Atlanta and [[Ron Gant]] walked, but Berryhill and [[Lonnie Smith]] each flied out and the inning was over.  Neither team scored in the eighth and the Pirates stranded [[Lloyd McClendon]] at second in the top of the ninth.  Atlanta came to bat in the bottom of the ninth three outs from defeat, and the Pirates were three outs away from their first National League championship since [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1979]].

===Bottom of the ninth===
Pendleton, who hit .311 in 1992, led off with a double in the right field corner.  It landed fair by two feet.<ref name=si1992/>  [[David Justice]] then hit a grounder to Jose Lind.  Lind, who won a [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] at second base in 1992 and committed only six errors during the season,<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lindjo01.shtml Jose Lind player page]</ref> booted the ball.  Justice was safe at first on the error and Pendleton advanced to third.  Drabek then walked Sid Bream to load the bases.  Pirate manager [[Jim Leyland]] then took Drabek out of the game after 129 pitches, and sent in reliever [[Stan Belinda]].  

The next batter, Gant, flied out to Bonds in deep left.  Pendleton tagged and came home to make the score 2-1, but Justice, the tying run, remained at second.  Catcher Berryhill was next.  On a 3-1 pitch that appeared to be a strike,<ref name=si1992/><ref name=fandn/><ref>[http://deadspin.com/5502736/pittsburgh-pirates-october-14-1992 Pittsburgh Pirates:Oct. 14, 1992], [[Will Leitch]], Deadspin.com</ref> Belinda walked Berryhill and the bases were again loaded.  Braves manager [[Bobby Cox]] sent up pinch-hitter [[Brian Hunter (baseball)|Brian Hunter]] for light-hitting second baseman [[Rafael Belliard]].  Hunter popped up for the second out.  With pitcher [[Jeff Reardon]] due up, Cox sent in another pinch-hitter, [[Francisco Cabrera]].

Cabrera, who played first base and catcher, had been called up from the minors on August 31<ref name=si1992/> and had batted only ten times for the Braves afterwards.<ref name=cabpage>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cabrefr01.shtml Francisco Cabrera player page]</ref>  He went to the plate wondering if he'd have to play second base in extra innings, Belliard having been just taken out of the game.<ref name=pittrib>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_136309.html "Q&A with Francisco Cabrera"], ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'', May 25, 2003</ref>  Pendleton told Cabrera to "Hit the ball over the shortstop".<ref name=si1992/>

Belinda threw a slider for ball 1.  The next pitch was a fastball for ball 2.  Belinda then threw a fastball over the plate that Cabrera hit very hard but foul into the left field seats.<ref name=si1992/>  Ron Gant, watching from the dugout, said later that after that pitch he "knew [Cabrera] was going to do it."<ref name=Game86>Wilkinson, Jack.  ''Game of My Life: Atlanta Braves''. 2007, Sports Publishing LLC, ISBN 978-1596700994, p. 86</ref>

Belinda threw another fastball, high, again over the plate.  Cabrera hit the ball over the shortstop, as Pendleton instructed, and to Bonds in left for a base hit.  Justice scored easily with the tying run, but Sid Bream was the winning run coming from second base, and Sid Bream was an unusually slow runner.<ref name=si1992/><ref name=pittrib/><ref name=Game86/>  The ball was hit to Bonds' left, forcing lefthanded Bonds to move left and throw across his body.<ref name=Game86/>  Bonds' throw was high and about six feet up the first base line, forcing Lavalliere to field the throw and sweep his glove back to the plate.  Bream beat the throw, just barely.  The Braves won the game 3-2, and the pennant.<ref name=si1992/>

====Sean McDonough's call====
The 1992 National League Championship Series was nationally televised on [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] with [[Sean McDonough]] and [[Tim McCarver]] on the call.  This is McDonough's description of the final moments of Game 7:
{{quote|And now the Braves<U+2019> season hangs in the balance as [[Francisco Cabrera]] comes to the plate to bat for the pitcher. He appeared in only twelve games this year for the Braves. He doesn't walk much, he walked only seventeen times in 300 at-bats in Triple-A this year. He hacked at the 2<U+2013>0 now the 2<U+2013>1. Line drive and a base hit! [[David Justice|Justice]] has scored the tying run. [[Sid Bream|Bream]] to the plate...and he is safe, safe at the plate! The Braves go to the [[1992 World Series|World Series]]! The unlikeliest of heroes wins the [[National League Championship Series]] for the Atlanta Braves. Francisco Cabrera, who had only ten at-bats in the major leagues during the regular season, singled through the left side, scoring [[Sid Bream]] from second base with the winning run. Bream, who's had five knee operations in his lifetime, just beat the tag from his ex-mate [[Mike LaValliere]], and Atlanta pulls out Game 7 with three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning. This place is bedlam. There will be no second nightmare for [[Bobby Cox]]. The final score in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series: the Braves 3 and the Pirates 2.}}

====Skip Caray's call====
On the [[Braves Radio Network]], this was how [[Skip Caray]] described the final moments of Game 7:
{{quote|Two balls, one strike. What tension! The runners lead. A lotta room in right-center, if he hits one there, we can dance in the streets. The two-one. Swung, line drive left field! One run is in! Here comes [[Sid Bream|Bream]]! Here's the throw to the plate! He is...SAFE! BRAVES WIN! BRAVES WIN! BRAVES WIN! BRAVES WIN! BRAVES WIN! They may have to hospitalize Sid Bream. He's down at the bottom of a huge pile at the plate. They help him to his feet. Frank Cabrera got the game-winner! The Atlanta Braves are National League champions again! This crowd has gone berserk, listen! Meanwhile, [[Barry Bonds]] is just now walking off the field. [[Andy Van Slyke]] is sitting on his glove in center field in shock. The Braves came from two runs down in the ninth, and with two outs Francisco Cabrera got the hit that won Atlanta the game, a two-run single to left! What a ballgame!}}

==Aftermath==
Andy Van Slyke sat motionless in centerfield for several minutes after the game ended, while the Braves celebrated at home plate.<ref name=kurk>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004374/1/index.htm "The Crulest Game"], [[Tim Kurkjian]], ''Sports Illustrated'', Oct. 26, 1992</ref>

The Braves lost the 1992 World Series to the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] in six games.  1992 was the second of five pennants for the Braves from [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|1991]] to [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|1999]], but only one of those pennants was followed by a World Series victory, in [[1995 World Series|1995]].  Francisco Cabrera went 0-1 in the 1992 Series.  He played only one more season in the big leagues, accruing 91 plate appearances for the [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|1993 Braves]].  He later managed the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]' [[Dominican Summer Cardinals|Dominican League]] affiliate.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1019802/index.htm "Tracking Them Down"], Bill Colson, ''Sports Illustrated'', July 31, 2000</ref>

The Pirates never recovered from their loss to the Braves.  Bonds and Drabek left via free agency, signing with the [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]] and [[1993 Houston Astros season|Astros]], respectively.  Bonds went on to set the all-time MLB [[home run]] record with 762.  The [[1993 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1993 Pirates]] went 75-87.  It was the first of 17 consecutive losing seasons (through [[2009 Pittsburgh Pirates season|2009]]), an all-time record for major North American professional sports.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09251/996247-63.stm "Pirates unmoved by record 17th losing season"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', Sept. 8, 2009</ref>

Game 7 of the 1992 NLCS marked the first time in MLB history that a team which was one out away from losing in a winner-take-all game of a playoff series instead won on the last pitch.<ref name=kurk/>  The March 1993 issue of ''Baseball Digest'' pronounced it the greatest baseball comeback ever,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=hysDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=francisco+cabrera+game&source=bl&ots=mtfTSugPu6&sig=O7Zp_uO2EGm_5UsDz1gcEIAexNs&hl=en&ei=FT8WTOKbLYOwMqeeycQL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDEQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&q=francisco%20cabrera%20game&f=false "Braves' Playoff Comeback in '92 Ranks with Classics], Jim Henneman, ''Baseball Digest'', March 1993</ref> as did John Smoltz immediately after the game.<ref name=si1992/>  A 2006 study by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pronounced Cabrera's game-winning single the eighth-"clutchest" hit in MLB history.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06275/726154-63.stm "Baseball's greatest hits"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', October 2, 2006</ref>  ESPN called the Pirates' defeat the eighth most painful in baseball history.<ref>[http://a.espncdn.com/page2/s/list/losses/031017.html Most painful losses in baseball history], Jeff Merron, ESPN.com</ref>
