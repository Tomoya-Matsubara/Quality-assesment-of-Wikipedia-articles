'''Panait Cerna''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: <U+041F><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0439><U+043E><U+0442> <U+0427><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430>, ''Panayot Cherna'', born '''Panayot Stanchov''' or '''Panait Staciov'''; [[August 26]] or [[September 25]], [[1881]]<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651. The second date is reported to have been once communicated by Cerna himself</ref>&ndash;[[March 26]], [[1913]]) was a [[Romania]]n poet, philosopher, literary critic and translator. A native speaker of Bulgarian, Cerna nonetheless wrote in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and developed a traditionalist style which was connected with [[Classicism]] and [[Neo-Classicism]]. Praised by the [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary society ''[[Junimea]]'', he was promoted by its leader [[Titu Maiorescu]], as well as by Maiorescu's disciples [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] and [[Simion Mehedin<U+0163>i]]. Cerna became the group's main representative during its decline, affiliating with both competing ''Junimist'' magazines, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]''.

A graduate of the [[University of Bucharest]], he completed his studies in the [[German Empire]]. There, he attended the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Leipzig]], befriending the self-exiled Romanian dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and the literary critic [[Paul Zarifopol]]. Cerna died in [[Leipzig]] at the age of thirty-one, after a long combat with [[tuberculosis]].

==Name==
Cerna's early name, rendered in Bulgarian as <U+041F><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0439><U+043E><U+0442> <U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0447><U+043E><U+0432>, was commonly [[Romanization of Bulgarian|transliterated]] into Romanian as ''Panait Stanciov'', ''Stancov'', ''Stanciof'' or ''Stancioff''. The poet's preferred name alluded to [[Cerna, Tulcea|Cerna]], his birthplace in [[Tulcea County]], [[Northern Dobruja]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref>

==Biography==
Panait Cerna's father was an [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarian]] schoolteacher, also named Panayot Stachov (Panait Stanciov), who settled in Cerna, where he married Maria, the daughter of local [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] peasants.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> Shortly before Maria Cerna gave birth to their son, Romanian administration began taking over in previously [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled Northern Dobruja. Stanchov, who was a Bulgarian [[Nationalism|nationalist]], refused to accept this change and left for the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], leaving his family behind.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> Reportedly, Panait Cerna never met his father.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref>

Although his links to [[Culture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian culture]] were weakened by the departure of his father, the future poet, who was baptized in the [[Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church]], became fluent in Bulgarian.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> According to literary critic [[George C<U+0103>linescu]], he always had some difficulties conversing in Romanian, but could write it with ease.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651, 652</ref> After completing primary school in his native village, he graduated from a high school in the [[Danube]] port of [[Br<U+0103>ila]], then enrolled at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in [[Bucharest]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> Soon after reaching the capital, he became involved in political debates and made his debut as a poet: these early activities are recorded in a 1904 series of articles in the student paper ''Tipuri <U+015F>i Ticuri'', where a ''P. Stanciov'' is the object of [[satire]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> By that time, he was discovered by ''Junimea'', and began collaborating with ''Convorbiri Literare'', a magazine led by [[Simion Mehedin<U+0163>i]].<ref>Ornea, p.78; Vianu, Vol.II, p.11</ref> 

Cerna graduated from university in 1906.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought a change in climate.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> He spent much of this period traveling through the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]], and several times visited regions of the [[Southern Carpathians]], in particular the area of [[Ruc<U+0103>r]], the [[Bucegi Mountains]], and the [[Jiu Valley]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> As C<U+0103>linescu notes, he had bought himself a horse from a Ruc<U+0103>r local, on credit and without delivering the sum promised on time.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> 

His love for the rural world, together with what C<U+0103>linescu describes as a "social preoccupation", made him an outspoken opponent of the way in which the authorities handled the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasant uprising of 1907]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> That year, as [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] parted with Mehedin<U+0163>i to establish ''Convorbiri Critice'', which advertised a ''Junimist'' agenda while standing against ''Convorbiri Literare'', Cerna became one of his main collaborators.<ref>Ornea, p.136-137</ref> The group of ''Convorbiri Critice'' writers also included [[D. Nanu]], [[Corneliu Moldovanu]], [[Emil G<U+00E2>rleanu]], [[Ion Dragoslav]] and [[Gheorghe V<U+00E2>lsan]].<ref>Ornea, p.137</ref>

In 1908, he decided to continue his studies in the [[German Empire]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.602, 651</ref> The decision was influenced and encouraged by ''Junimea'' and its leader [[Titu Maiorescu]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.602; Vianu, Vol.II, p.13</ref> C<U+0103>linescu describes this as a sign of late ''Junimist'' [[elitism]], a view which implied that all literary men should be academics.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.602</ref> This, he argues, was one of the few areas in which ''Junimea'' still differed from the traditionalist magazine ''[[S<U+0103>m<U+0103>n<U+0103>torul]]'', which was more open to less elitist environments.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.602</ref> 

Cerna visited the [[University of Heidelberg]], but, following the advice of Maiorescu, decided in favor of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], where he studied Philosophy, [[English literature|English]] and [[German language literature]] (1908-1910).<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> Around 1909, he first came into contact with the Caragiales, and, according to the dramatist's own testimony, tutored his son, the future poet [[Luca Caragiale]], providing his "scientific education".<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> Ion Luca Caragiale described Cerna as "a distinguished scientist and a great lover of music".<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> The two writers met a second time in [[Leipzig]], in 1910, when Cerna declared himself by Caragiale, whom he described as "one of the richest intelligent minds to have ever been produced by our nation."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> Two years later, Cerna enthusiastically welcomed the literary debut of Caragiale's other son, [[Mateiu Caragiale|Mateiu]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.898</ref> He was also acquainted with Zarifopol, with whom he discussed literary issues.

From late 1910 to early 1912, Cerna was at the [[University of Leipzig]], where he attended courses held by the philosophers and psychologists [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Eduard Spranger]] and [[Hans Volkelt]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651, 652</ref> Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of "decrepit" [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] members of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]], adding: "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure..."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> Volkelt guided his research in the scientific field, and coordinated his [[PhD]] thesis of 1913, ''Die Gedankenlyrik'' ([[German language|German]] for "Contemplative Poetry").<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> According to C<U+0103>linescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of "natural ideas" over [[reasoning]], and concluded that "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref> Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: ''In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding'' ("An idea is a damned thing when it comes to poetry").<ref name="zarifartisti">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Arti%C5%9Fti_%C5%9Fi_idei_literare_rom%C3%A2ne:Poezie_filozofic%C4%83 ''Arti<U+015F>ti <U+015F>i idei literare rom<U+00E2>ne: Poezie filozofic<U+0103>''] (wikisource)</ref>

Panait Cerna died in Leipzig, shortly after receiving his diploma.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref><ref name="zarifartisti"/> Zarifopol was present when Cerna succumbed, and recorded that Maiorescu's views on poetry where preoccupied his friend even on his his deathbed.<ref name="zarifartisti"/>

==Literary contribution==
Cerna was a traditionalist poet, listed by C<U+0103>linescu among the contributors to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] whose work "steers toward [[Classicism]]", as do those of Dragomirescu, Mehedin<U+0163>i, [[Henri Sanielevici]], [[D. Nanu]], [[Ion Trivale]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [[Corneliu Moldovanu]], [[Mihail Codreanu]], [[Alexandru Davila]] and [[George Murnu]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.641-660</ref> In this account, Cerna is one in a group of "conceptual" poets, all of whom were connected with Dragomirescu.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652, 657</ref> 

Literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] notes the influence exercised on Cerna and other traditionalists by [[Mihai Eminescu]], Romania's major mid-19th century Classicist and ''Junimist'' poet,<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.213; Vol.III, p.322</ref> while, according to Zarifopol, the poet considered himself an "improved follower" of Eminescu.<ref name="zarifgeniul">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Arti%C5%9Fti_%C5%9Fi_idei_literare_rom%C3%A2ne:Geniul_neprih%C4%83nit ''Arti<U+015F>ti <U+015F>i idei literare rom<U+00E2>ne: Geniul neprih<U+0103>nit''] (wikisource)</ref> The poet was a late admirer of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], a main figure of [[England|English]] [[Romanticism]], and translated from his ''[[Childe Harold]]''.<ref name="etetudes"><U+00C9>mile Turdeanu, ''<U+00C9>tudes de litt<U+00E9>rature roumaine et d'<U+00E9>crits slaves et grecs des principaut<U+00E9>s roumaines'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, New York & K<U+00F6>ln, 1985, p.397. ISBN:9004070982</ref> Zarifopol also stressed that Cerna sought to reconcile poetry and philosophy, and that he particularly treasured the Classicist poets [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Louise-Victorine Ackermann]] and [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], as well as the [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]] [[Sully Prudhomme]].<ref name="zarifartisti"/> The same commentator recounted their disagreement when it came to Caragiale, whom Cerna enjoyed only for his power of "observation", but whom he argued lacked "concepts".<ref name="zarifgeniul"/> For Zarifopol, this statement, made with "a fanatical and dogmatic pathos", evidenced a moment of "academic foolishness" in Cerna's career.<ref name="zarifgeniul"/> 

C<U+0103>linescu, who criticizes the poet for his difficulties with the language, describes him as "not accomplished".<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> Elaborating on this, he states: "[Cerna is] declamatory, banal and dry in his use of metaphors, although he displays a touch of the sublime here and there."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref>

Cerna's most characteristic subject was [[unrequited love]], which, C<U+0103>linescu argues, evoked his actual experience with women, and "the regret of not having lived through the great mystery of love."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> Such poems, the critic notes, point to the influence of Classicist authors such as Eminescu, [[Dante Aligheri]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]] (the latter poet had also been quoted in Cerna's ''Die Gedankenlyrik'').<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> One of the pieces, written from the perspective of a man who has once failed to gain the object of his affection, features the lyrics:

For George C<U+0103>linescu, Cerna's "euphoric thirst for life" recalled the work of Parnassian and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] author [[Alexandru Macedonski]], but was tempered by "the mellow [[anemia]] of the phthisic."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> One of his better-known pieces from the series of love poems read:

Cerna's protest over the violent repression of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 revolt]] was lyricized in several contexts. In one such indignant piece, Cerna called on Peace not to arrive until the social issue would be solved.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> In ''Zile de durere'' ("Days of Sorrow"), he appeals to the Sun to wash out the blood of peasant victims:

One of Cerna's poems was inspired by the [[Book of Genesis]], where [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] confronts God. Titled ''Pl<U+00E2>nsetul lui Adam'' ("Adam's Sobbing"), it builds on themes which recalled Byron's 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', and constituted an interrogation of [[divine law]]s.<ref name="etetudes"/>

==Legacy==
Panait Cerna's lifetime success and literary fame made him the target of adulation among his fellow traditionalists. According to C<U+0103>linescu, this group saw him as Romania's answer to Schiller and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> ''Junimea'' saw in him one of its most important members of the early 20th century, while several historians note that he was so only because, at that stage, the literary society was declining.<ref>Ornea, p.78; Vianu, Vol.II, p.11</ref> Mehedin<U+0163>i's 1914 account of the ''Junimist'' promotion of the "original manifestations of Romanian culture" listed Cerna alongside [[Alexandru G. Florescu]] and other minor writers.<ref>Ornea, p.78</ref> Literary historian [[Z. Ornea]] argues that this evidenced not just a decline in standards, but also Mehedin<U+0163>i's "tastelessness".<ref>Ornea, p.78</ref> Also according to Ornea, the association with Dragomirescu was also characteristic for the ''Junimist'' twilight, given that this circle had failed to impose "a new literary direction" and was tributary to the legacy of various traditionalist groups.<ref>Ornea, p.137</ref> Zarifopol deplores Cerna's submission to traditionalist and Classicist goals, arguing that it eventually ruined Cerna as a poet and made him unhappy.<ref name="zarifartisti"/> 

The poet's adoption of a mainstream approach to poetry also pleased his public, and, C<U+0103>linescu notes, schoolbooks of the day celebrated him as a Romanian classic while completely ignoring more controversial [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] such as [[Alexandru Macedonski]] and [[Dimitrie Anghel]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> [[Demostene Botez]], one of the authors to have been influenced by Cerna's style, dedicated him a poem which read:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top" 
|
<poem>
Un gigant ai fost pe-o lume plin<U+0103> numai cu pitici,

</poem>

<poem>
A giant you have been in a world filled only with dwarfs,
A lonely evening star among so many fire flies.
</poem>

In his essay ''Din registrul ideilor ginga<U+015F>e'' ("From the Register of Gentle Ideas"), where he satirizes the Romanian public's reception of literature, Zarifopol looks into the problems faced by Cerna in satisfying his readers. Using one of Cerna's own accounts as the basis for this analysis, he notes that a group of his young "female admirers" where unpleasantly surprised to find out out that their idol was "short, pudgy, wide-necked and ruddy-faced."<ref name="zarifneint">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Din_registrul_ideilor_ginga%C5%9Fe:Ne%C3%AEn%C5%A3elegeri_inocente_%C3%AEntre_public_%C5%9Fi_arti%C5%9Fti ''Din registrul ideilor ginga<U+015F>e: Ne<U+00EE>n<U+0163>elegeri inocente <U+00EE>ntre public <U+015F>i arti<U+015F>ti''] (wikisource)</ref> He notes: "the girls [...] were thus in full agreement with the philosophical tradition which, since the old days, has set as a supreme ideal a mosaic of perfections that is naive and unlikely."<ref name="zarifneint"/>

Cerna's work was disliked by the [[Modernism|modernists]], in particular by theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]]. Lovinescu considered many of the expressions Cerna used in his poetry to be "unacceptable", citing their supposed banality.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.805-806</ref> This assessment was itself contested by C<U+0103>linescu, who argued that the lyrics in questions are "actually the acceptable ones", and that the awkward wordings "are entirely lost in lyrical fluency."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.805-806</ref>

The poet's house in Cerna is presently a museum, dedicated in part to his memory, and also housing a permanent exhibit dedicated to the traditional arts and crafts of [[Tulcea County]].<ref name="pcicemt">{{ro icon}} [http://icem.romclub.ro/cerna.php ''Casa memorial<U+0103> Panait Cerna''], at the  [http://icem.romclub.ro/ Tulcea Institute for Environmental Studies and Museology]; retrieved [[April 17]], [[2008]]</ref> It also features a bust of the poet.<ref name="pcicemt"/>
