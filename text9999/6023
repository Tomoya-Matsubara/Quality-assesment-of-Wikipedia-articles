'''Zidovudine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''azidothymidine''' ('''AZT''') (also called ZDV) is an [[antiretroviral drug]], the first approved for treatment of [[HIV]]. It is also sold under the names '''Retrovir'''<U+00AE> and '''Retrovis'''<U+00AE>, and as an ingredient in [[Combivir]]<U+00AE> and [[Trizivir]]<U+00AE>. It is an [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[thymidine]].

==History== 
Zidovudine was the first drug approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection.  [[Jerome Horwitz]] of Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]] first synthesized AZT in [[1964]], under a [[United States|US]] [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) [[Federal grant|grant]]. It was originally intended to treat [[cancer]], but failed to show efficacy and had an unacceptably high [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]] profile. The drug then faded from view until February [[1985]], when [[Samuel Broder]], [[Hiroaki Mitsuya]], and [[Robert Yarchoan]], three scientists in the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), collaborating with Janet Rideout and several other scientists at Burroughs Wellcome (now [[GlaxoSmithKline]]), started working on it as an AIDS drug.  After showing that this drug was an effective agent against HIV ''[[in vitro]]'', the team conducted the initial [[clinical trial]] that provided evidence that it could increase [[CD4]] counts in AIDS patients.

A [[placebo]]-controlled [[randomized trial]] of AZT was subsequently conducted by Burroughs-Wellcome, in which it was shown that AZT could prolong the life of patients with AIDS. Burroughs Wellcome Co. filed for a patent on AZT in [[1985]]. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the drug (via the then-new FDA accelerated approval system) for use against HIV, AIDS, and ''AIDS Related Complex'' (ARC, a now-defunct medical term for pre-AIDS illness) on [[March 20]] [[1987]], and then as a preventive treatment in [[1990]]. It was initially administered in much higher dosages than today, typically 400 mg every four hours (even at night). However, the unavailability at that time of alternatives to treat AIDS affected the risk/benefit ratio, with the certain toxicity of HIV infection outweighing the risk of drug toxicity. One of AZT's side effects includes [[anemia]], a common complaint in early trials. 

Modern treatment regimens typically use lower dosages (e.g. 300 mg) two to three times a day. [[As of 1996]], AZT, like other [[antiretroviral drug]]s, is almost always used as part of ''[[highly active antiretroviral therapy]]'' (HAART). That is, it is combined with other drugs in order to prevent mutation of HIV into an AZT-resistant form.<!--

The crystal structure of AZT was reported by Alan Howie ([[Aberdeen University]]) in 1988.<!--

In the solid state AZT forms a [[hydrogen bond]] network. Note that AZT is based upon a sugar.

==Prophylaxis== 
[[Image:Azt crystal.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A crystal of AZT, viewed under polarized light]]
AZT may be used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to substantially reduce the risk of HIV infection following a significant exposure to the virus (such as a needle-stick injury involving blood or body fluids from an individual known to be infected with HIV).<!--
  --><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5409a1.htm | title = Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HIV | accessdate = 2006-03-29}}</ref>

AZT is also recommended as part of a regimen to prevent [[vertical transmission|mother-to-child transmission]] of HIV during pregnancy, labor and delivery.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite web | url = http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/ContentFiles/PerinatalGL.pdf | title = Recommendations for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women for Maternal Health | accessdate = 2006-03-29}}</ref>
With no treatment, approximately 25% of infants whose mothers are infected with HIV will become infected.  AZT has been shown to reduce this risk to approximately 8% when given in a three-part regimen during pregnancy, delivery and to the infant for 6 weeks after birth.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite journal | author=Connor E, Sperling R, Gelber R, Kiselev P, Scott G, O'Sullivan M, VanDyke R, Bey M, Shearer W, Jacobson R | title=Reduction of maternal-infant transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 with zidovudine treatment. Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076 Study Group. | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=331 | issue=18 | pages=1173-80 | year=1994 | id=PMID 7935654}}</ref>
Use of appropriate combinations of antiretroviral medications and [[cesarean section]] when necessary can further reduce mother-child transmission of HIV to 1-2%.

==Side effects==
Common side effects of AZT include nausea, headache, changes in body fat, and discoloration of fingernails and toenails.  More severe side effects include [[anaemia]] and [[bone marrow suppression]], which can be overcome using [[erythropoietin]] or [[darbepoetin]] treatments.<sup>23</sup>  These unwanted side effects might be caused by the sensitivity of the <U+03B3>-DNA polymerase in the cell [[mitochondria]].  AZT has been shown to work additively or synergistically with many anti-HIV agents; however, [[acyclovir]] and [[ribavirin]] decrease the antiviral effect of AZT. Drugs that inhibit [[liver|hepatic]] [[glucuronidation]], such as [[indomethacin]], [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (Aspirin) and [[trimethoprim]], decrease the elimination rate and increase the toxicity.<!--

==Viral resistance==
AZT does not destroy the HIV infection, but only delays the progression of the disease and the replication of virus, even at very high doses.  During prolonged AZT treatment HIV has the ability to gain an increased resistance to AZT by [[mutation]] of the [[reverse transcriptase]].  A study <!-- citation needed --> showed that AZT could not impede the resumption of virus production, and eventually cells treated with AZT produced viruses as much as the untreated cells. So as to slow the development of resistance, it is generally recommended that AZT be given in combination with another [[Reverse transcriptase inhibitor#Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs)|reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] and an antiretroviral from another group, such as a [[protease inhibitor]] or a [[Reverse transcriptase inhibitor#Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)|non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]].

==Mode of action==
[[Image:Azt pills.JPG|thumb|right|250px|AZT in oral and injectable form]]
Like other [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s, AZT works by inhibiting the action of [[reverse transcriptase]], the [[enzyme]] that HIV uses to make a [[DNA]] copy of its [[RNA]].  The viral double-stranded DNA is subsequently spliced into the [[DNA]] of a target [[cell (biology)|cell]], where it is called a [[provirus]].<!--

The azido group increases the [[lipophilic]] nature of AZT, allowing it to cross [[cell membrane]]s easily by [[diffusion]] and thereby also to cross the [[blood-brain barrier]].  Cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective 5'-triphosphate form. Studies have shown that the termination of the formed DNA chains is the specific factor in the inhibitory effect.

The triphosphate form also has some ability to inhibit cellular [[DNA polymerase]], which is used by normal cells as part of [[cell division]].<!--

==Controversy==
AZT has been the target of some controversy due to the nature of the patent process.<ref>''[[The Best Democracy Money Can Buy]]'' by [[Greg Palast]] ([[2002]])</ref> 

===Patent issues===

In [[1991]], [[Public Citizen]] filed a lawsuit claiming that the AZT/Zidovudine patent was invalid. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] ruled in [[1992]] in favour of [[Burroughs-Wellcome]], the licensee of the patent.<ref>People with Aids Health Group v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 578</ref>  The court ruled that the challenge of the citizen group was not the correct approach to evaluate the underlying validity of the patent which was already being litigated in another suit. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/law/FederalMaterials/FederalCases/BurroughsWellcomevBarrLaboratories.htm | accessdate=2007-02-28 | title=Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Laboratories, 40 F.3d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1994) | publisher=University of Houston -- Health Law and Policy Institute | author=US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit}}</ref>    In [[2002]], another lawsuit was filed over the patent by the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]].

However, the [[patent]] expired in 2005 (placing AZT in the [[public domain]]), allowing other drug companies to manufacture and market generic AZT without having to pay [[GlaxoSmithKline]] any royalties. The U.S. FDA has since approved four [[generic drug|generic]] forms of AZT for sale in the U.S.
