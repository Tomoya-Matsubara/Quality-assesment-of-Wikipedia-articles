{{for|the last [[bishop of Selsey]]|Stigand of Selsey}}
'''Stigand''' (died [[1072]]) was an [[Anglo-Saxon England|English]] churchman of pre-[[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]] England. He served as [[archbishop of Canterbury]], [[bishop of Winchester]] and was twice [[bishop of Elmham]]. Stigand acted as an adviser to several members of both the [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Norman]] lines of English royalty.  

Five successive popes, including [[Pope Nicholas II]] and [[Pope Alexander II]], all excommunicated Stigand for holding both the see of Winchester and the see of Canterbury at the same time. Stigand submitted to [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] and assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066. In [[1070]] he was deposed by the papal legate and was imprisoned at Winchester. At the time of the death of [[Edward the Confessor]], only the royal estates and the estates of Harold had been larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand.

==Early life==
Stigand first appears in the historical record in 1020 when, as a royal chaplain to [[Canute the Great|Canute]], he was appointed to the church that Canute built at [[Ashingdon]] to honor the souls of those killed in Canute's coming to power in 1016.<ref name=Hill61>Hill, Paul ''The Road to Hastings: The Politics of Power in Anglo-Saxon England'' Stroud: Tempus 2005 ISBN00-7524-3308-3 p. 61</ref><ref name=Emma123>O'Brien, Harriet ''Queen Emma and the Vikings: A History of Power, Love and Greed in Eleventh-Century England'' New York:Bloomsbury ISBN 1-58234-596-1 p. 123</ref> After Canute's death he served Canute's son, [[Harold Harefoot]]. His name was Norwegian and he was born in [[East Anglia]], possibly born a native of Norwich.<ref name=Barlow59>Barlow, Frank ''Edward the Confessor'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1970 ISBN 0-520-01671-8 p. 59</ref> He was definitely of mixed English and Scandanavian stock.<ref name=Hill61/> After the death of [[Harthacanute]], Stigand appears to have acted as the chief adviser of Canute's widow, [[Emma of Normandy]] mother of both Harthacanute and [[Edward the Confessor]].<ref name=Barlow59/>

==Bishop of Elmham and Winchester==

Shortly after Edward the Confessor's coronation, Stigand was appointed to the [[Bishop of Norwich|see of Elmham]], almost assuredly on Emma's advice.<ref name=Barlow76>Barlow, Frank ''Edward the Confessor'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1970 ISBN 0-520-01671-8 p. 76</ref> Elmham was the diocese that covered East Anglia. On [[April 3]] [[1043]]<ref name=Powicke210>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London: Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 210</ref> he was consecrated bishop.<ref name=Powicke223>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London: Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 223</ref> Edward, however, deposed Stigand in late 1043 and deprived him of his wealth. The deposition was short lived, as Edward returned Stigand to the episcopal chair by 1044.<ref name=Barlow77>Barlow, Frank ''Edward the Confessor'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1970 ISBN 0-520-01671-8 p. 77</ref> The reasons for the deposition are unknown, but it was probably connected to the similar fall from grace of the king's mother Emma that occurred at the same time. Rumors of the time included one that had Emma and Stigand having an affair, which led to both of them being deprived of the king's favor.<ref name=Hindley318>Hindley, Geoffrey ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons: The beginnings of the English nation'' New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers 2006 ISBN 978-0-78671738-5 p. 318</ref>

In 1047 he was translated to the [[Bishop of Winchester|see of Winchester]].<ref name=Powicke223/><ref name=Powicke258>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London: Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 258</ref> He retained at Elmham, however, until 1052.<ref name=Barlow87>Barlow, Frank ''Edward the Confessor'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1970 ISBN 0-520-01671-8 p. 87</ref> Some have held that he supported Earl [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwin of Wessex]] in his quarrel with [[Edward the Confessor]],<ref name=Barlow123>Barlow, Frank ''Edward the Confessor'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1970 ISBN 0-520-01671-8 p. 123</ref> others hold that he was neutral.<ref name=Walker49>Walker, Ian ''Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King'' Wrens Park Publishing 2000 ISBN 0-905-778-464 p. 49</ref> Whatever the case, in 1052 there was arranged a peace between the earl and the king.<ref name=Barlow123/>

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
In 1052 the archbishop of Canterbury, [[Robert of Jumieges]], was outlawed and driven from England. Stigand was then appointed to the archbishopric.<ref name=Powicke210/> This was either a reward from Godwin, for siding with Godwin's family in the crisis of 1051&ndash;1052, or one from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to the situation in 1052 when Godwin returned.<ref name=Walker49/> [[Pope Leo IX]] and his two successors refused to recognize him, regarding Robert as the rightful archbishop. Stigand released Elmham to his brother [[<U+00C6>thelmaer]], but retained the bishopric of Winchester at the same time he was archbishop.<ref name=Powicke258/> He was the first non-monk to be named to either the Archbishopric of Canterbury or of York since before the days of [[Dunstan]].<ref name=Monastic66>[[David Knowles|Knowles, Dom David]] ''The Monastic Order in England: From the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' Second Edition Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976 reprint ISBN 0-521-05479-6 p. 66</ref> He was later accused of [[simony]], or the buying of ecclesiastical office, but all such accusations date to after 1066, and are thus suspect due to the post-[[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]] desire to vilify Stigand and the English Church as corrupt and backward.<ref name=Huscroft46>Huscroft, Richard ''Ruling England 1042-1217'' London: Pearson Longman 2005 ISBN 0-582-84882-2 p. 46-47</ref> Stigand may have been behind the effort to locate [[Edward the Exile|Edward the Atheling]] and his brother Edmund after 1052, possibly to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward.<ref name=Walker75>Walker, Ian ''Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King'' Wrens Park Publishing 2000 ISBN 0-905-778-464 p. 75</ref>

==Excommunicated ==
[[Image:Papaalessandro.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Pope Alexander II was one pope who excommunicated the archbishop.]]
In 1058, however, [[Pope Benedict X|Benedict X]] gave him the [[pallium|pall]],<ref name=BHOArchCant>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33853 British History Online Archbishops of Canterbury] accessed on November 2, 2007</ref> but this pope was deposed in the following year. At this time, there was a growing movement in the church to reform itself and, being a [[benefice#Before the Reformation|pluralist]], or the holding of more than one [[benefice]] at the same time, came under scrutiny. Since Stigand retained Winchester, he was definitely a pluralist, which [[Pope Nicholas II]] had in 1061 declared to be uncannoical unless approved by the pope, when he declared the [[Aldred|Aldred of Worcester]] must give up [[see of Worcester|Worcester]] in order to be consecrated [[Archbishop of York]].<ref name=Huscroft52>Huscroft, Richard ''Ruling England 1042-1217'' London: Pearson Longman 2005 ISBN 0-582-84882-2 p. 62</ref> Five successive popes ([[Pope Leo IX]], [[Pope Victor II]], [[Pope Stephen IX]], [[Pope Nicholas II]] and [[Pope Alexander II]])<ref name=BHOArchCant/> excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. Not only did Stigand hold Winchester along with Canterbury, but he held the [[Gloucester Cathedral|abbey of Gloucester]] and the [[Ely Cathedral|abbey of Ely]] and perhaps others.<ref name=Knowles72>[[David Knowles|Knowles, Dom David]] ''The Monastic Order in England: From the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' Second Edition Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976 reprint ISBN 0-521-05479-6 p. 72</ref> His position was such that even bishops in England were leery of being consecrated by him.<ref name=Chibnall39>Chibnall, Marjorie ''Anglo-Norman England 1066-1166'' Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1986 ISBN 0-631-15439-6 p. 39</ref> Both [[Giso of Wells]] and [[Walter of Lorraine|Walter of Hereford]] travelled to Rome to be consecrated by the Pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand.<ref name=Huscroft51>Huscroft, Richard ''Ruling England 1042-1217'' London: Pearson Longman 2005 ISBN 0-582-84882-2 p. 51</ref> The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to good effect by the Normans in their propaganda before, during and after the Conquest.<ref name=Douglas170>Douglas, David C. ''William the Conqueror: The Norman Impact Upon England'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1964 p. 170</ref> During the brief period that he held a pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate [[<U+00C6>thelric II|Aethelric of Selsey]] and [[Siward, Bishop of Rochester|Siward of Rochester]].<ref name=Walker136>Walker, Ian ''Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King'' Wrens Park Publishing 2000 ISBN 0-905-778-464 p. 136-138</ref>

Due to Stigand's issues with the papacy, the [[Archbishop of York|diocese of York]] was able to encroach on the suffragan bishops normally subject to Canterbury. York had long been held in common with [[Bishop of Worcester|Worcester]], but during the period when Stigand was excommunicated, the see of York also claimed [[Bishop of Lichfield|Lichfield]] and [[Bishop of Lincoln|Dorcester]] as part of its archiepiscopal diocese.<ref name=Barlow27>Barlow, Frank ''The Feudal Kingdom of England: 1042-1216'' Fourth Edition New York: Longman 1988 ISBN 0-582-49504-0 p. 27</ref> In 1062, however, papal legates of [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] came to England. They did not depose Stigand, and even consulted with him and treated him as archbishop.<ref name=Walker127>Walker, Ian ''Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King'' Wrens Park Publishing 2000 ISBN 0-905-778-464 p. 127</ref> He was allowed to attend the council they held and was an active participant with the legates in the business of the council.<ref name=Walker148>Walker, Ian ''Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King'' Wrens Park Publishing 2000 ISBN 0-905-778-464 p. 148-149</ref>

==Final years and legacy==
[[Image:William1.jpg|thumb|220px|William I, shown here from the Bayeux Tapestry, eventually deposed Stigand.]]
Stigand is said by Norman writers to have crowned [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold II]] in January of 1066<ref name=Chibnall21>Chibnall, Marjorie ''Anglo-Norman England 1066-1166'' Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1986 ISBN 0-631-15439-6 p. 21</ref> and is depicted at that coronation in the [[Bayeux tapestry]], but current historical research has shown that this ceremony was performed by [[Aldred]], [[Archbishop of York]] due to the controversy about Stigand's position.<ref name=Chibnall39/><ref name=Huscroft48>Huscroft, Richard ''Ruling England 1042-1217'' London: Pearson Longman 2005 ISBN 0-582-84882-2 p. 48</ref><ref name=Walker136/> Stigand did support Harold and was present at Edward the Confessor's deathbed.<ref name=Barlow249>Barlow, Frank ''Edward the Confessor'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1970 ISBN 0-520-01671-8 p. 249-250</ref> The English sources claim that Aldred crowned Harold, while the Norman sources claim that Stigand did so, with the conflict between the various sources probably tracing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify Harold and depict his coronation as unlawful.<ref name=Walker136/>

After the death of Harold, Stigand worked with [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Earl Edwin]] and [[Morcar of Northumbria|Earl Morcar]], as well as [[Aldred|Archbishop Aldred of York]], to put [[Edgar <U+00C6>theling|Edgar Atheling]] on the throne.<ref name=Walker183>Walker, Ian ''Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King'' Wrens Park Publishing 2000 ISBN 0-905-778-464 p. 183-185</ref> This plan did not come to fruition, however, as the northern earls and some of the other bishops were against it.<ref name=Douglas204>Douglas, David C. ''William the Conqueror: The Norman Impact Upon England'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press 1964 p.203-206</ref> Stigand submitted to [[William I of England|William]] at [[Wallingford]] in early December of 1066,<ref name=Huscroft18>Huscroft, Richard ''Ruling England 1042-1217'' London: Pearson Longman 2005 ISBN 0-582-84882-2 p. 18-19</ref> and assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066.<ref name=Douglas204/> William took Stigand in his train to [[Normandy]] in 1067.<ref name=Knowles104>[[David Knowles|Knowles, Dom David]] ''The Monastic Order in England: From the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' Second Edition Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976 reprint ISBN 0-521-05479-6 p. 104</ref> After the first rebellions broke out, William adopted a policy of conciliating the church and gave Stigand a place at court, as well as giving administrative positions to Aldred of York and Aethelwig, abbot of [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].<ref name=Barlow57>Barlow, Frank ''The English Church 1066-1154'' New York: Longman 1979 ISBN 0-582-50236-5 p. 57</ref> Once the danger of rebellion was past, however, William had no further need of Stigand.<ref name=Barlow87>Barlow, Frank ''The Feudal Kingdom of England: 1042-1216'' Fourth Edition New York: Longman 1988 ISBN 0-582-49504-0 p. 87</ref> At a Council held at [[Winchester]] at Easter,<ref name=Huscroft60>Huscroft, Richard ''Ruling England 1042-1217'' London: Pearson Longman 2005 ISBN 0-582-84882-2 p. 60-61</ref> the bishops met with papal legates from [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]].<ref name=Powicke549>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London: Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 549</ref> On [[April 11]] [[1070]] he was deposed<ref name=Powicke210/> by the papal legate, Ermenfrid, bishop of Sion<ref name=BHOArchCant/> and was imprisoned at Winchester. Deposed along with him were his brother Aethelmaer bishop of Elmham, [[<U+00C6>thelric II|Aethelric]] [[Bishop of Chichester|bishop of Selsey]], [[Ethelwin]] [[bishop of Durham]] and [[Leofwin]]e [[bishop of Lichfield]], who was married.<ref name=Douglas324>Douglas, David C.
