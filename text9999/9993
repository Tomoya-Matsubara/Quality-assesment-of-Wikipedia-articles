'''Kathy Sanborn''' (born January 16) is an American [[jazz vocalist]], pianist, composer, and producer based in [[San Francisco, California]]. Sanborn's notable recordings include the albums ''Six Degrees of Cool'', ''Blues for Breakfast'', ''Small Galaxy'', and ''Peaceful Sounds''. Stylistically, Sanborn has been compared with 1950s [[cool jazz]] singers [[Anita O<U+2019>Day]], [[Chris Connor]], and [[June Christy]], due to her smooth, velvet vocals and clear diction. ''JazzTimes'' on Sanborn's work: "Romance is always in the air as far as Kathy Sanborn is concerned, and her songs are reflections of those emotions which take flight when overpowered by love." <ref>http://jazztimes.com/community/articles/27105-kathy-sanborn</ref>

Originally from [[Los Angeles]], Sanborn graduated magna cum laude from the [[California State University, Sacramento]]. A trained pianist, Sanborn creates both music and lyrics for her projects. Sanborn<U+2019>s albums include both jazz instrumental and vocal songs. Her 2011 project, ''Blues for Breakfast'', features a song dedicated to the jazz masters of old, such as innovative trumpeter [[Miles Davis]]. Adding musical contributions to ''Blues for Breakfast'' are renowned [[GRAMMY]]<U+00AE> nominee bassist Scott Petito, drummer Chris Carey, and trumpeter Wayne Ricci. 

Sanborn is a member of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] and [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]], and her biography is profiled in [[Who's Who in America]].

== Debut Album: ''Peaceful Sounds'' ==

Self-released in 2008, ''Peaceful Sounds'' is Sanborn<U+2019>s debut album. An organic blend of jazz and new age music, ''Peaceful Sounds'' is dedicated to those who take a stand for peace. The sometimes dark and philosophical project garnered almost immediate international radio attention. With the release of ''Peaceful Sounds'', Eric Cohen of New York radio station WAER proclaimed that Sanborn<U+2019>s voice <U+201C>truly is a gift from the heavens.<U+201D><ref>http://www.kathysanborn.com/press/</ref>

== ''Small Galaxy'' ==

Released in 2010 through the Pacific Coast Jazz label, ''Small Galaxy'' marks a major turnaround in style and emotion from Sanborn<U+2019>s first work. ''Small Galaxy'' includes upbeat songs and infectious energy, and is minus the heaviness that colored the debut album, ''Peaceful Sounds''.

Perhaps in large part due to its cheerful lyrics and bouncy songs, the ''Small Galaxy'' album climbed to No.&nbsp;4 on radio station WSCA's Top Chart, and garnered critical acclaim for its silky, sensual vocals.

== ''Blues for Breakfast'' ==

Sanborn<U+2019>s third album, ''Blues for Breakfast'', released March 2011. Besides Sanborn<U+2019>s smooth vocals and keyboard work, the album features GRAMMY<U+00AE> nominee Scott Petito<U+2019>s  bass, Chris Carey<U+2019>s drums, and Wayne Ricci<U+2019>s trumpet.

The title track, "Blues For Breakfast," showcases Sanborn<U+2019>s love of jazz history and her affection for the famed musicians of the 1930s-50s who performed on New York<U+2019>s 52nd Street. Sanborn says: <U+201C>I wrote the song, Blues for Breakfast, as a fond tribute to the jazz masters of days gone by. On New York<U+2019>s 52nd Street, the greats would <U+2018>walk the high wire<U+2019> and enthrall and inspire new generations of jazz players. As jazz continues to evolve in the modern era, I imagine the masters are looking down and nodding their approval.<U+201D><ref>http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=19426</ref>

== Classic Film Dedication ==
In 2011, Sanborn released her single, "Magnetized," a song dedicated to film historian and TCM movie host [[Robert Osborne]]. A fan of classic movies, Sanborn composed the jazz love song as an homage to the power of attraction exhibited by film stars whose screen presence can virtually electrify an audience.<ref>http://www.kathysanborn.com/news/</ref>

== ''Six Degrees of Cool'' ==
Released August 28, 2012, ''Six Degrees of Cool'' showcases Sanborn's cool jazz roots and influence. The album includes "Bitter Winter" and "Shanty Man," songs directly referring to societal effects of economic depressions, both past and present. "Drawing from renowned influences such as Cool Jazz giants Miles Davis, [[Chet Baker]], and Anita O<U+2019>Day, Sanborn<U+2019>s new album brings Cool Jazz into today<U+2019>s contemporary scene." <ref>http://news.allaboutjazz.com/news.php?id=99547</ref>

== Jazz in the Modern Era ==

A strong believer in the natural and unobstructed evolution of [[jazz music]], Sanborn strives to take her jazz songs into the modern era, appealing to all generations of jazz fans. She says, "The music needs to evolve, and this means letting new artists in on the airwaves<U+2014>and not excluding a hot new player simply because he or she is an independent artist." <ref>http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35542</ref>
