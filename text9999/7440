'''Ralph George Houk''' (born [[August 9]], [[1919]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]), nicknamed "The Major," is a former [[catcher]], [[coach (baseball)|coach]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], and front office executive in [[Major League Baseball]]. He is best known as the successor of [[Casey Stengel]] as the manager of the [[New York Yankees]] from 1961-63, when he won three consecutive [[American League]] pennants and the 1961-62 [[World Series]] championships.

==Playing career==
Houk was a catcher working his way through the Yankees' [[farm system]] when the U.S. entered [[World War II]]. He enlisted in the armed forces, became an [[Army Ranger]], and received a battlefield commission, rising from private to major. He was a combat veteran of [[Bastogne]] and the [[Battle of the Bulge]], and was awarded the [[Silver Star]], [[Purple Heart]] and [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. Returning to baseball after the war, Houk eventually reached the major leagues, serving as the Yankees' second- and third-string catcher behind [[Yogi Berra]]. A right-handed hitter, Houk appeared in only 91 games over eight seasons (1947-54), finishing with a [[batting average]] of .272. Although the Yankees participated in seven World Series during that period, Houk had only two Series at-bats (one in [[1947 World Series|1947]], the other in [[1952 World Series|1952]]), batting .500.

Houk's last two years as an active player, 1953-54, were actually spent as the Yankees' full-time bullpen coach, thus beginning his managerial apprenticeship. In 1955, he was named manager of the Yanks' AAA affiliate, the [[Denver Bears]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. Following three highly successful seasons at Denver, Houk returned to the Bronx as Stengel's first-base coach from 1958-60. From late May through early June [[1960 in baseball|1960]], Houk served as acting manager of the Yanks for 13 games while Stengel, 70, was sidelined by illness. (The team won 7 and lost 6.) Then, after the Yanks lost the [[1960 World Series]] to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] <U+2014> and with Houk one of the hottest managerial candidates in baseball <U+2014> the Yankees "discharged" Stengel (to use Stengel's own words) and promoted Houk.

==A player's manager==
Houk was known as a "player's manager" <U+2014> albeit one with a fearsome temper. [[Tommy Lasorda]], a [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] manager, briefly played for Houk at Denver (one of Lasorda's rare stints outside the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodger]] organization) and called Houk the best handler of men he ever played for, and modeled his managerial style on him. On the other hand, the [[Kansas Sports Hall of Fame]], of which Houk is a member, describes Houk as "rough, blunt and decisive" and his famous cap-throwing and -kicking tantrums in arguments with [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] earned him 45 ejections as a skipper in the majors. In [[2007 in baseball|2007]], Houk was tied with another former Yankee skipper, [[Billy Martin]], for fourteenth place on baseball's "most ejected" list. <ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=2903669</ref>

He was a breath of fresh air after the distant and sarcastic Stengel, and the early 1960s Yankees responded to his leadership. His [[1961 in baseball|1961]] team led by [[Roger Maris]] (61 [[home run]]s), [[Mickey Mantle]] (54 homers) and [[Whitey Ford]] (25 victories) won 109 games and thrashed the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in five games in the [[1961 World Series|World Series]]. His [[1962 in baseball|1962]] club won 96 games and the pennant and outlasted the [[San Francisco Giants]] in a thrilling [[1962 World Series|Fall Classic]]. In [[1963 in baseball|1963]], the Yanks won 104 games and rolled to the pennant, but were ignominiously swept in four games by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the [[1963 World Series|Series]].

==In the Yankees front office==
That winter, Houk moved into the Yankees' front office as [[General Manager (baseball)|general manager]], replacing [[Roy Hamey]], and Berra, at the end of his brilliant playing career, became the Yanks' new skipper. Yogi would win the [[1964 in baseball|1964]] pennant, but Houk and the Yankee ownership quickly became disenchanted with Berra's work and in mid-season they made up their mind to fire him. After Berra's seven-game loss to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[1964 World Series]], Houk sacked the Yankee legend and ironically hired the Cardinal manager, [[Johnny Keane]], as his successor. But the great postwar Yankee dynasty was aged and crumbling, the farm system had seriously deteriorated, the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City Athletics]] were no longer a reliable source for major league talent, and the inception of the player draft cut into Yankee recruiting. Keane, a longtime minor league skipper, was better suited by temperament for managing young players than established and aging superstars, and his hiring was a failure. The team fell to sixth in [[1965 in baseball|1965]] and had won only four of the first 20 games of [[1966 in baseball|1966]] when Keane was fired by Houk, who named himself manager.

==Back to the bench==
Houk came down from the front office (he was eventually succeeded as general manager by [[Lee MacPhail]]) to begin a second, and far less successful, term as Yankee skipper, finishing the 1966 season. Their talent depleted, the Yankees finished dead last<U+2014>the first time they had done so since [[1912 in baseball|1912]]. At season's end, the Yankees would start a long rebuilding process, which included [[Bobby Richardson]]'s retirement (longtime roommate [[Tony Kubek]] had retired with a bad back after the 1965 season) and the trading of both Maris and [[Clete Boyer]]. 

Houk would continue to manage the Yankees from 1967-73. His best season was [[1970 in baseball|1970]], when the Yanks won 93 games, but finished 15 games behind the eventual world champion [[Baltimore Orioles]]. He worked for [[George Steinbrenner]] for one season, in [[1973 in baseball|1973]], and was the Bombers' manager during their final game in 1973 at the "original" [[Yankee Stadium]] prior to its closure for two seasons for needed renovations.

He then left the Yankee organization to become the manager of the rebuilding [[Detroit Tigers]]. His [[1975 in baseball|1975]] team lost 102 games, but by [[1978 in baseball|1978]] Houk had restored Detroit  to respectability and brought to the majors future stars of the [[Sparky Anderson]] Tigers such as [[Lou Whitaker]], [[Alan Trammell]] and [[Jack Morris]]. After an 86-76 season in 1978, Houk retired.

===Boston Red Sox===
Since the late 1950s, Houk and the [[Boston Red Sox]], the Yankees' arch-rivals, had flirted over their manager's job. After two years of retirement, in the autumn of [[1980 in baseball|1980]], Houk (at 61) was ready to get back into baseball and when the Red Sox called about their open managerial post (they had fired [[Don Zimmer]]), he jumped at the chance. 

Although not as daunting as his Detroit assignment, Houk faced another rebuilding job: the powerful Boston team of the 1970s was about to lose marquee players such as [[Carlton Fisk]] and [[Fred Lynn]] and needed to retool its roster. But Houk rose to the challenge, and in four seasons produced three over-.500 teams. On his watch, Boston broke in young players such as [[Wade Boggs]], [[Roger Clemens]], [[Bruce Hurst]] and [[Marty Barrett]]. When Houk retired from managing permanently in October [[1984 in baseball|1984]], just after his 65th birthday, he bequeathed the core of another pennant winning ballclub (in this case, in [[1986 in baseball|1986]]) to his successor, [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]]. 

His final record, over 20 years with the Yankees (1961-63, 1966-73), Tigers (1974-78) and Red Sox (1981-84) was 1,619 wins and 1,531 losses (.514), plus eight wins and eight losses in the World Series. After his first three championship seasons, he never appeared in the postseason.

==Late career==
Houk served in the front office of the [[Minnesota Twins]] under [[Andy MacPhail]], Lee's son, from 1986-88 before quitting the game for good.

Colorful opinions about Houk can be found in [[Jim Bouton]]'s classic 1970 memoir, ''[[Ball Four]]''. Houk was Bouton's first major league manager and sparred with him over contracts when Houk was the Yankees' GM.
