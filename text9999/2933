'''Robert Were Fox''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (26 April 1789 &ndash; 25 July 1877) was a British [[geologist]], [[natural philosopher]] and inventor.  He is known mainly for his work on the temperature of the earth and his construction of a compass to measure magnetic dip at sea.<ref>The main source for this article is  [[ODNB]] entry: Denise Crook, <U+2018>Fox, Robert Were (1789<U+2013>1877)<U+2019>, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10042  accessed 13 June 2006]. Page 133 of the [http://books.google.com/books?id=EyoJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA94&dq=Robert+Were+Fox+biography#PPA133,M1 Dictionary of National Biography (1899)] also has information on Fox.</ref>

==Life and family==

Robert Were Fox the Younger was born on 26 April 1789 at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], [[United Kingdom]], the eldest son of [[Robert Were Fox the Elder|Robert Were Fox]] (1754 &ndash; 1818)<ref>Fox and his father (1754-1818) had the same name.  The father also merited an entry in [[ODNB]]: Philip Payton, <U+2018>Fox, Robert Were (1754 &ndash; 1818)<U+2019>, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/42083  accessed 13 June 2006].</ref> and his wife, Elizabeth Tregelles. He had nine siblings.  [[Fox family of Falmouth|The Fox family]] were members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), and were [[Fox_family_of_Falmouth#Genealogy|descended]] from members who had long settled in [[Cornwall]], although they were not related to [[George Fox]] who had introduced the community into the county.

In 1814, Fox the Younger married Maria Barclay (1785 &ndash; 1858), daughter of Robert and Rachel Barclay of Bury Hill, near Dorking, Surrey. Maria's sister, Lucy, married Fox's cousin, George Croker Fox (1784<U+2013>1850).  

Robert Were Fox the Younger and his wife had three children, [[Anna Maria Fox|Anna Maria]] (1816 &ndash; 1897), [[Barclay Fox|Barclay]] (1817 &ndash; 1855) and [[Caroline Fox|Caroline]] (1819 &ndash; 1871). Both Caroline and Barclay Fox's [[Fox_family_of_Falmouth#Caroline_and_Barclay.27s_Journals|journals]] have been published.

Robert Were Fox the Younger died on 25 July 1877 and was buried at the Quaker Burial Ground at [[Budock]].<ref>R. W. Fox was buried at the Quaker Burial Ground, Budock, along with his daughters, Anna Maria and Caroline, according to a Burial Plan at the Cornwall Record Office. However, no gravestones for them remain: the Burial Ground was vandalised in the 1970s and many gravestones broken.</ref>

== Business interests ==

Fox was involved in many aspects of his [[Fox_family_of_Falmouth#Business_interests_of_the_Fox_family|family's businesses]], along with several of his brothers.  He also served as Honorary [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of the U.S.A in Falmouth from 1819 to 1854.

Fox and Joel Lean were granted a patent in 1812 for their modifications of steam engines.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Specifications of the patent granted to Robert Were Fox and Joel Lean | journal = The Repertory of Arts and Manufactures, Arts, Manufactures and Agriculture | year = 1813 | volume = 23 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=plIEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA200&dq=robert+were+fox | accessdate = 2008-09-14 | pages = 200 &ndash; 204 | author1 = Arts, Repertory of | author2 = Agriculture, Manufactures and}}</ref>

== Horticultural interests ==
Fox's gardens at Rosehill<ref>[http://members.tripod.com/morrablectures/fox.htm Sandra & George Pritchard's Fox Rosehill Garden website (accessed 9 December 2007).] The Fox Rosehill Gardens and Penjerrick are now both open to the public.</ref> and [[Penjerrick Garden|Penjerrick]], near Falmouth, became noted for the number of exotic plants which he and his son, Barclay, had naturalized.

Fox's work was in what today would be referred to as [[geophysics]].  He was distinguished for his researches on the internal temperature of the earth, contributing papers to the [[Royal Geological Society of Cornwall]],<ref>Denise Crook, <U+2018>Fox, Robert Were (1789<U+2013>1877)<U+2019>, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10042  accessed 15 Nov 2007]</ref> and being the first to prove that temperature definitely increases with depth (the [[geothermal gradient]]), his observations being conducted in Cornish mines from 1815 for a period of forty years.<ref>[http://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/story/schools.htm Mining History Site places Fox in his context.]</ref>  In 1829 he began a set of experiments on the artificial production of miniature [[wikt:metalliferous|metalliferous]] veins by means of the long-continued influence of electric currents, and his main results were published in 1836.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fox, Robert Were | title = Observations on Mineral Veins | journal = Reports of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society | year = 1836 | volume =  | pages =  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=cwQ4AAAAMAAJ | accessdate = 2007-12-08 | publisher = Printed by J. Trathan }}</ref>

In 1834 Fox constructed an improved form of deflector dipping needle compass, or [[dip circle]], for polar navigation.<ref>'''Dipping Needle'''
In ''A New and Universal Dictionary of the Marine'' by William Falconer, improved and modernised by William Burney; T. Cadell & William Davey and John Murray, 1830: Pages 122, 123 and Plate IX, Figure 11, the dip of a needle is defined as <blockquote>"a certain property which all needles possess when rubbed with a lodestone of inclining the north end below the level of the horizon: this property found to increase in going northward."</blockquote></ref> One was used by Sir [[James Clark Ross]] on his Antarctic expedition and used to discover the position of the [[South magnetic pole]].<ref>[http://www.shnh.org/PUB_ANH_next_abs.html#McCONNELL Archives of Natural History]</ref>

He was a key person in the development of the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]] and its promotion of scientific research and training. He was an active member of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]].

Robert Were Fox, his cousin, George Croker Fox (1784<U+2013>1850) and brother, Alfred Fox, assembled excellent collections of minerals, which are now in the [[British Museum (Natural History)]], given by [[Sir Arthur Edward Ian Montagu Russell, 6th Baronet|Arthur Russell]].<ref>Mineralogy references: Embery, P.G. and Symes, R.F.
