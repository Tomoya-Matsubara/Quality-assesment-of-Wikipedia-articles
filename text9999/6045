'''Magdalen College''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>m<U+0254><U+02D0>dl<U+0268>n}} "maudlin") is one of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|constituent colleges]] of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]]. As of 2006 the college had an estimated [[financial endowment]] of <U+00A3>153 million.<ref>[http://www.btinternet.com/~akme/OXCpress.html Oxford College Endowment Incomes, 1973-2006] (updated July 2007)</ref>

Magdalen College was founded as Magdalen Hall in [[1448]] by [[William of Waynflete]], Bishop of [[Winchester, England|Winchester]]. It became Magdalen College in [[1458]]. The founder's statutes included provision for a choral foundation of men and boys (a tradition that has continued to the present day) and made reference to the pronunciation of the name of the College in English.

Regarded by some as one of the most beautiful of the [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] colleges, Magdalen is also one of the most visited. It stands next to the [[River Cherwell]] and has within its grounds a [[deer]] park and [[Addison's Walk]]. [[Magdalen College School]] also lies nearby. The large, square [[Magdalen Tower, Oxford|Magdalen Tower]] is a famous Oxford landmark, and it is a tradition that the college choir sings from the top of it early on [[May Morning]]. The college's current president, Professor [[David Clary]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], was earlier a [[Fellow]] and Senior Tutor at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].

== Grounds ==

The college has large grounds, close to the city centre. They stretch north and east from the college, and are most of the area bounded by [[Longwall Street]], the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] (where the [[porter's lodge]] is located), and [[St Clement's, Oxford|St Clement's]].[[Image:Magdalen Deer.jpg|thumb|right|The deer in the Grove]]

=== The Grove (Deer Park) ===
This large meadow occupies most of the north west of the college's grounds, from the New Buildings and the Grove Quad up to Holywell Ford. During the winter and spring, it is the home of a herd of [[deer]]. It is possible to view the meadow (and also the deer) from the path between New Buildings and Grove Quad, and also from the archway in New Buildings.

In the 16th century, long before the introduction of the deer, the grove consisted of gardens, orchards, and [[bowling green]]s. During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], it was used to house a regiment of soldiers. At one point in the C19th it was home to three traction engines belonging to the works department of the college.

[[Image:Magdalen Addison's Walk.jpg|thumb|left|Addison's Walk in Spring]]

=== The Meadow (bounded by Addison's Walk) ===
This triangular meadow lies to the east of the college, bounded on all sides by the [[River Cherwell]]. In the spring, it is filled with the flower Fritillaria Meleagris (commonly known as [[Snakeshead Fritillary]]), which gives it an attractive green-purple colour. These flowers grow in very few places, and have been recorded growing in the meadow since around 1785. Once the flowering has finished, the deer are moved in for the Summer and Autumn. In wet winters, some or all of the meadow may flood, as the meadow is lower lying than the surrounding path. All around the edge of the meadow is a tree-lined path, Addison's Walk. It is a beautiful and tranquil walk, favoured by students, dons, and visitors alike. In high summer, however, the walk can suffer from unpleasant smells due to the putrefaction of the river. It also links the college with Holywell Ford, and the Fellows' Garden.

=== The Fellows' Garden ===
Located to the north east of the Meadow, this long and (fairly) narrow garden follows the Cherwell to the edge of the [[University Parks]]. In spring, the ground is covered with flowers. In summer, there are some flowers, many different shrubs, and the varied trees provide dappled cover from the sun. It is linked to Addison's Walk by a bridge.

=== Buildings ===
The Great Tower was built between 1492 and 1509, and is an imposing landmark on the eastern approaches to the city centre. The hall and chapel were built at similar times, though both have undergone some changes in the intervening years.

[[Image:132909970 956c6a6510 o.jpg|thumb|right|The Cloisters]]

The Cloister or Great Quad was built in 1474-80 and has been altered several times since then. In 1822, the north side was in bad shape, and was knocked down while most of the fellows were away from college (only a small group of fellows were in favour of demolishing it). It was rebuilt shortly afterwards. In the early 1900s, renovations were performed, and it was returned to a more mediaeval character. Student rooms were installed in the (very large) roof space in the 1980s, and are some of the most sought after rooms in the college. 

The New Building was built across a large lawn to the north of the Great Quad in 1733. Its spacious setting is due to the builders' intentions to create an entirely new quad, but only one side was completed. [[C. S. Lewis]] had his rooms in this building.
[[Image:Magdalen St Swithun's.jpg|thumb|right|St Swithun's Quad and Grammar Hall]]
The college has four other quads. The irregularly shaped St John's Quad is the first on entering the college, and includes the Outdoor Pulpit and old Grammar Hall. It connects to the Great Quad via the Perpendicular Gothic Founder's Tower, which is richly decorated with carvings and pinnacles and has carved bosses in its vault.

The Chaplain's Quad runs along the side of the Chapel and Hall, to the foot of the [[Magdalen Tower|Great Tower]]. St Swithun's Quad and Longwall Quad (which contains the Library) date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and make up the southwest corner of the college. The Grove Buildings are the newest, built in the 1990s  in a traditional style.

== Chapel ==
The chapel is a place of worship for members of the college and others in the university community and beyond. Its tradition is influenced by the [[Catholic Revival]] in the Church of England. Said and sung services are held daily during term. The choir sings Choral [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] every day except Tuesday. On Sundays, Sung Mass is offered in the morning and [[Compline]] (Night Prayer) and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|Benediction]] is sung congregationally to [[plainsong]] at ten o'clock. Mass is also sung on major holy days.

== Choir ==
Magdalen is one of the three Choral Foundations in Oxford, meaning that the formation of the choir was part of the statutes of the college, the other two choral foundations being [[New College, Oxford|New College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. 

The choir consists of twelve Academical Clerks who are students at the College, and sixteen boys aged seven to fourteen, all of whom have scholarships at [[Magdalen College School]]. The school was originally founded for this express purpose but has long since become an independent public school. 

The choristers' day begins at 7:30, with an early morning practice before school. There is further practice immediately after school, followed by Choral Evensong six nights a week, in term; the Monday service is sung by the boys only, and the Friday service only by the Academical Clerks. On Saturdays there is an afternoon practice, while on Sundays there is a practice at 09:30 followed by Eucharist, then a further afternoon practice followed by Evensong which ends at 7pm. Most of the boys thus have a longer working day, and a busier weekend, than their parents.

The Choir has numerous College duties as well as a recording and touring schedule. Traditionally the Choir sings at College Gaudies and at other special events throughout the year, as well as performing on social occasions such as Carols by Candlelight before Christmas and the famous [[May Morning]]. On this occasion the Choir sings madrigals at 6am from the top of the college bell-tower to the assembled mass of students and townsfolk celebrating in the streets below. 

In its long history the choir has had many well known organists, such as [[Daniel Purcell]], [[Sir John Stainer]] and [[Bernard Rose (musician)|Bernard Rose]], while past Organ Scholars include [[Dudley Moore]], and past Academical Clerks include [[Harry Christophers]] (founder and director of The Sixteen) and [[Robin Blaze]].

The choir records regularly and In 2005 was nominated for a prestigious [[Grammy Award]] for its [[Compact disc|CD]], ''With a Merrie Noyse'', of music by [[Orlando Gibbons]]. Other recent works include the BBC's [[Blue Planet]] and Paul McCartney's classical piece [[Ecce Cor Meum]].

The current Informator Choristarum (the master and conductor of the choir) is the composer [[Grayston Ives|Dr Bill Ives]], possibly better known as a former King's Singer. A disc of his music, ''Listen Sweet Dove'', is amongst the choir's latest releases.

==Centre for the History of Childhood==

Centre for the History of Childhood, situated at Magdalen College, is the first institution within the United Kingdom that focuses on studying every interdisciplinary aspect of the history of children from the Greeks and Romans to the present day.<ref>[http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/research/clusters/history_childhood/index.htm History Faculty<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Sport ==
=== Rowing ===

Magdalen held '[[Head of the River]]' between 2004 and 2007. This means it has won the [[Eights Week|Summer Eights]] competition in each of these years. [[Eights Week|Summer Eights]] is the most prestigious university regatta held in Oxford. The Men's 1st Torpid became Head of the River in the 2008 [[Torpids]] having bumped [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel]] out of first place on the second day of racing.
