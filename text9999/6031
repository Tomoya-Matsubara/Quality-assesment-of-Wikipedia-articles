The 145th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 3 April 1999. Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Featuring the tallest rower in Boat Race history, Cambridge won the race in the second-fastest time ever.  It was their seventh consecutive victory in the event.

In the reserve race, Cambridge's [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] defeated Oxford's Isis in the fastest time ever, while Cambridge won the [[Women's Boat Race]].

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 17 July 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  First held in 1829, the race takes place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 17 July 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 14 July 2014}}</ref>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1998|1998 race]] by three lengths,<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/results| publisher =The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 17 July 2014}}</ref> with Cambridge leading overall with 75 victories to Oxford's 68 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatrace.org/men/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 14 July 2014}}</ref>

The first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history | title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 14 July 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.  It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.<ref name=results/>

[[Andrew Lindsay]] was confident that the Oxford crew would be more motivated than their opponents: "our advantage over Cambridge is that we are hungry for the victory.  Everyone in the Oxford boat is driven to go and win this damn thing".<ref name=hung/>  He was making his third and final appearance in the race having lost in both the [[The Boat Race 1997|1997]] and [[The Boat Race 1998|1998 race]].  His grandfather represented Cambridge in the 1930s, and his uncle, Alexander Lindsay, rowed for the losing Oxford crew in [[The Boat Race 1959|the 1959 race]] before triumphing [[The Boat Race 1960|the following year]].<ref name=hung>{{Cite news|title = Hunger the starter in university challenge | first = Rob |last = Hughes | date = 31 March 1999 | work = [[The Times]] | issue = 66475 | page=42}}</ref>   Cambridge boat club president and Canadian international rower Brad Crombie was also making his third Boat Race appearance, attempting to complete a hat-trick of victories.<ref name=hung/>  Sean Bowden was the head coach of Oxford. His Cambridge counterpart, [[Robin Williams (rowing coach)|Robin Williams]], suggested "it still feels like all or nothing to us.  The fear of defeat, the aim of trying to push the limits is motivation itself".<ref name=hung/>  Just as he had done in the [[The Boat Race 1993|1993 race]], umpire Mark Evans introduced modifications to the starting procedure, suggesting that he would be content to hold the crews for up to ten seconds between issuing the "set" and "go" commands.<ref name=ump>{{Cite news | title = Oxford are starting to impress | first = Mike | last = Rosewell | work = [[The Times]] | date = 2 April 1999 | page = 52 | issue = 66477}}</ref>  Cambridge's Williams remarked: "I'm happy as long as both crews abide by it", Bowden was nonplussed "Go is when you start races.  I'm happy."<ref name=ump/>

The race was sponsored for the first time by [[Aberdeen Asset Management]],<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rowing-new-sponsor-keeps-boat-race-afloat-1076436.html | title = Rowing: New sponsor keeps Boat Race afloat | date = 26 January 1999 |  first = Hugh |last = Matheson | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 17 July 2014}}</ref> and both crews were competing for the Aberdeen Asset Trophy. It was the fiftieth anniversary of the BBC's coverage of the event and over the preceding five years had secured an average audience in excess of six million.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Oxford prepare to pay back old rivals for past defeats | first = Mike | last = Rosewell | first2 = John | last2=Goodbody|work = [[The Times]] | page = 39 | date = 3 April 1999 | issue = 66478}}</ref>

Bookmakers could not initially separate the crews, offering [[Odds#Odds on|odds on]] for either boat to win.<ref name=weighs/>  However as the start of the race approached, Williams had suggested that he was worried by his crew's "inconsistency" and Oxford were declared favourites.<ref name=fail>{{Cite news | title = Oxford fail to live up to expectations | first = Mike | last = Rosewell | date = 5 April 1999 | page = 32 | issue= 66478 | work = [[The Times]]}}</ref>  Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.  Despite being warned by umpire Davis, Cambridge were soon half-a-length ahead, and a second clear by the Mile Post.<ref name=fail/>  The lead was extended to a length by [[Hammersmith Bridge]] and Sharif had steered her boat into a better angle of attack.  Pushing on, Cambridge were seven seconds up by Chiswick Steps and nine seconds at [[Barnes Railway Bridge]].  They passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead, with an eleven-second advantage over the Dark Blues.  The Light Blues finished in 16 minutes 41 seconds, a time only bettered once before, in 1998.<ref name=results/><ref name=fail/>  It was the first time since 1936 that Cambridge had secured seven consecutive victories.<ref name=fail/>

In the reserve race, Cambridge's [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] beat Oxford's Isis by one-and-a-half lengths, their ninth victory in ten years, and in a record time of 16 minutes 58 seconds which beat the fastest time recorded in 1996 and repeated in 1998.<ref name=results/>  Cambridge won the 51st Women's Boat Race by one length in a time of 6 minutes 1 second, their eighth consecutive victory.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/results | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| title = Women's Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 17 July 2014}}</ref>
