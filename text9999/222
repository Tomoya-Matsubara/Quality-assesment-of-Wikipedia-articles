The '''Grayrigg derailment''' was a fatal [[Train wreck|railway accident]] that occurred at 20:15 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on [[23 February]] [[2007]], just to the south of [[Grayrigg]], [[Cumbria]], in north-west [[England]]. The initial conclusion of the accident investigation is that the [[derailment]] was caused by a faulty set of [[Railroad switch|points]] (number 2B), controlled from Lambrigg [[ground frame]]. Whilst the scheduled inspection on [[18 February]] did not take place, enquiries are continuing to establish why the faults were undetected.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6398057.stm|title=Rail crash report blames points|publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=[[26 February]] [[2007]]}}</ref>

==Incident==
The 17:15 [[Virgin West Coast]] [[British Rail Class 390|Pendolino]] service from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] to [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]], a limited stop Pendolino Primo train, [[headcode]] 1S83, travelling on the [[West Coast Main Line]] was derailed by a defective set of points.<ref name="virgin">{{cite press release| url=http://www.virgintrainsmediaroom.com/index.cfm?articleid=1004 | title=Serious incident in Cumbria - Statement No. 3 - 24 February 2007 | publisher=Virgin Trains| date=[[2007-02-24]]| accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> The train was reported to have been travelling at up to 95 [[Miles per hour|mph]] (150 km/h) when it was derailed.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6391633.stm|title=One dead in Cumbria train crash |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=[[24 February]] [[2007]]}}</ref> The train, unit 390 033 "City of Glasgow",which was constructed at Washwood Heath, Birmingham in 2002,  had nine carriages and carried 111 [[passenger]]s and four members of staff.<ref name=raib>{{cite web|url=http://www.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources/070226_I012007_Grayrigg.pdf|title=RAIB interim report into a derailment at Grayrigg, Cumbria 23 February 2007|publisher=Rail Accident Investigation Branch}}</ref>

Passengers said that the [[Railroad car|carriages]] of the [[train]] began rocking and swaying very badly before the train crashed. The train was reported as being evacuated at around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with [[Thermographic camera|thermal imagery equipment]] to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, and at least twelve ambulances and at least five [[fire apparatus|fire engines]], three [[Royal Air Force]] [[Sea King]] [[helicopter]]s, two [[mountain rescue]] teams, and one [[Merseyside Police]] helicopter. The rescue operation was impeded by rain, darkness and access problems due to the fact that surrounding roads are narrow country lanes.<ref name=BBC/> Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud. 

[[North West Ambulance Service|Cumbria Ambulance Service]] initially reported that the train was six carriages long and that the second carriage had slipped down an embankment, with the carriage trapping up to eight people. Later, a BBC News reporter at the scene reported that all but one carriage had been upturned.

Live BBC TV coverage at 08:15 the following morning revealed that although the entire train had been derailed, the rear carriages were still standing nearly vertical on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, which was the front five carriages was the worst affected, whereas First Class with four rear carriages was least affected. The leading carriage (a driving motor coach) had headed down the embankment, and been turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side at the foot of the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the banking. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air after the centre portion of the train then toppled sideways down the embankment. All of the carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the [[crumple zone]]s at their ends. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver (who had remained at the controls) was trapped for around an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab.<ref name=BBC2/> The majority of the four train crew were in the rear First Class section of the train. 

Hospitals in the area, including some over the [[Scotland|Scottish]] border in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] were put on standby, but not all received patients. According to BBC News, five passengers were admitted to [[Royal Preston Hospital]] in critical condition. Police later released a statement revealing that one passenger, 84 year old Margaret Masson from [[Glasgow]], had died after being admitted to hospital from the crash site. Her [[funeral]] took place on [[31 March]] [[2007]] at [[Craigton]] [[crematorium]] in Glasgow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=483034|title=Rail Victim's Funeral|publisher=News & Star|date=2007-03-31}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
A family liaison centre was set up in Glasgow Central Station for worried relatives.

Within three hours of the crash the site had been sealed off with a five mile cordon. The line was expected to be closed for two weeks, with Virgin Trains saying that the line would not re-open to passenger services until [[March 12]] [[2007]].<ref name=BBC3/> The recovery operation was slowed by problems in getting heavy lifting gear to the site which required temporary roads to be constructed.

[[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]], [[Virgin Group]] chairman, visited the scene of the crash at 11 a.m. the following morning to comment on the incident and during his news conference at the site said that he regarded the driver, named as Iain Black from [[Dumbarton]],<ref name=BBC4>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6480567.stm|title=Hero train driver tells of ordeal|date=2007-03-22|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> as a hero, as he had remained in his seat to ensure the safety of passengers.<ref name=BBC2/> Mr Black left hospital in late March and stated that "I've got to be in the cab to help the train and it never crossed my mind to leave".<ref name=BBC4/>

As a result of the suspicion that faulty points were the cause of the crash, [[Network Rail]] checked over 700 sets of similar points across the country as a "precautionary measure"<ref name=BBC3>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6393867.stm | title=Crash sparks national rail checks | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=[[24 February]] [[2007]]}}</ref> saying later that "nothing of concern" had been found.<ref name=OtherPointsOK>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6394451.stm | title=Network safe, rail bosses insist | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=[[25 February]] [[2007]]}}</ref> 

The operation to remove the train from the site began on the evening of [[March 1]] [[2007]] with the first carriages moved from the embankment. This allowed passengers' property to be retrieved and gave investigators access to the train interior, which previously hadn't been possible because it would have been unsafe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/6410631.stm|title=First carriages moved from wreck|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=[[2 March]] [[2007]]}}</ref> The last of the carriages were removed on [[March 4]] [[2007]] and the [[A685 road]] was reopened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisthelakedistrict.co.uk/display.var.1235443.0.last_rails_cars_and_crane_shipped_out.php|title =Last rails cars and crane 'shipped out'|publisher=Westmorland Gazette|date=2007-03-05}}</ref>

Trains began running on the line again on [[March 12]] subject to a speed restriction of 50mph at the crash site. The first train was the 0510 Manchester to Glasgow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1255245,00.html|title=Trains Back On Crash Line|publisher=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

==Cause==
Lambrigg ground frame, which is located 600 metres south-west of the crash site, controls two crossovers (each one comprising two sets of [[railroad switch|points]]) to allow trains to be crossed from one running line to the other in emergencies or during track maintenance work. These points are only used occasionally, being locally operated after a release is obtained from Carlisle power [[signal box]]. They are normally locked in the main line 'running' position. Early statements by Chief Superintendent Martyn Ripley of [[British Transport Police]] suggested that investigations would focus on these points.

Investigations were launched by the [[Rail Accident Investigation Branch]] and [[HM Railway Inspectorate|Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate]].<ref name=BBC2>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6392197.stm|title=Crash inquiry to focus on points|publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=[[24 February]] [[2007]]}}</ref>  [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]] rail union leader [[Bob Crow]] said on [[BBC News]] that a points failure was responsible for the incident.  Experts compared the cause to that of the [[Potters Bar rail crash]] in 2002.<ref name=BBC3/>

On [[26 February]], an interim report published by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation.<ref name=raib/> The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was the condition of the stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover which resulted in the loss of [[rail gauge|gauge separation]] of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the Euston to Glasgow train. 

Following the RAIB report, Network Rail released a statement in which its Chief Executive, [[John Armitt]], described how the organisation was "devastated to conclude that the condition of the set of points at Grayrigg caused this terrible accident."  He apologised "to all the people affected by the failure of the infrastructure."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/4008.aspx|title=Network Rail responds to initial RAIB report|publisher=[[Network Rail]]}}</ref>

The RAIB report noted that the [[Network Rail New Measurement Train]] ran over the site on [[21 February]]. This train uses [[laser]]s and other instruments to make measurements of the track geometry and other features such as overhead line height and stagger, and the track gauge, twist and cant. It is not used to inspect points, but it also takes a video record of the track which can be reviewed later. The RAIB is currently in the process of reviewing these records.

Commenting on the possibility that the train's video might have been used to detect the points damage and thereby prevent the accident, a Network Rail spokesperson said: "The [inspection] train runs at speeds of up to 125&nbsp;mph, or 95&nbsp;mph on this stretch. There would be no point somebody watching it at that speed as they wouldn't be able to pick up any faults. It has to be run in super-slow motion to spot faults. The train runs for up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week. It would probably take someone most of the month to watch one day's worth of data. It's not what it's there for. It's a backwards reference tool". 

Network Rail has also admitted it failed to carry out a scheduled visual track inspection in the area on the Sunday before the crash. 

Bob Crowe of the RMT union said: "This is shutting the stable door after the horse has well and truly bolted. We argued this train should not replace visual inspections. Inspectors who walk the track are the eyes and ears of the railway. They don't just check the safety of the track, they look at the area surrounding it, check for signs of potential trouble such as gaps in the fence where vandals could get in". Labour MP [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] added: "The fact that Network Rail apparently had footage of a missing stretcher bar days before the fatal crash is very worrying".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=rail-chiefs-never-watched-broken-rail-vid%26method=full%26objectid=18684956%26siteid=89520-name_page.html| title=Rail Chiefs Never Watched Broken Rail Vid| publisher=Mirror.co.uk| date=[[2007-02-28]]}}</ref>

==The accident site==
The area near the accident, south of [[Tebay]] in Cumbria, is near the scene of a [[Tebay rail accident|fatal rail accident]] on [[15 February]] [[2004]], when four rail workers were killed by a runaway track maintenance trailer.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4816206.stm | title=Pair jailed for Tebay rail deaths | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=[[17 March]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> There was also [[List of rail accidents in the United Kingdom#1946 - 1969|a collision accident there]] on [[18 May]] [[1947]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://home.clara.net/gw0hqd/bumps/180547/180547.htm | title=Ministry of Transport Accident Report Between Grayrigg and Oxenholme, L.M.S.R., May 18, 1947 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette]] | accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref>

==Subsequent service disruption==
Immediately after the accident, all services were suspended and the First Scotrail Sleeper train - the [[Caledonian Sleeper]] - was curtailed and passengers transferred to overnight coaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6392055.stm|title=Crash leads to travel disruption|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-02-24|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>

The line closure that followed the initial service suspension saw most Virgin services terminate at [[Preston railway station|Preston]] or [[Lancaster railway station|Lancaster]] from the south, with rail replacement buses offered to [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]] and all stations along the route. There were also several non-stop trains that began at Preston and ran directly to [[London Euston]]. Local services all terminated short but many were able to make their journeys as their destinations were off branches. The [[Caledonian Sleeper]] was diverted via the [[East Coast Main Line]].

==City of Glasgow==
In an ironic twist of fate, the Grayrigg derailment is not the first British rail accident to feature a train or locomotive named "City of Glasgow". In the [[Harrow and Wealdstone railway accident]] on the 8th October, [[1952]], the locomotive at the head of the sleeper train from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] to [[Euston Station|London Euston]], whose crew were responsible for the incident, was [[LMS Princess Coronation Class|Class 8P]] No. 46242 ''City of Glasgow''.
