'''Francis Arthur Freeth''' (2 January 1884 <U+2013> 15 July 1970) {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]}} was a British [[industrial chemist]]. He spent much of his career at [[Brunner Mond]] and its successor [[Imperial Chemical Industries]], as chief chemist, research manager and in a recruiting capacity, with particular knowledge of [[phase rule]] chemistry, and developed many processes related to the manufacture of [[explosive]]s. He made a critical contribution to the British [[World War I]] effort by devising new ways to manufacture [[ammonium nitrate]], which was recognised with an honour, and a smaller contribution in [[World War II]] for the [[Special Operations Executive]]. Freeth created links between Brunner Mond and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] chemistry, particularly at the [[University of Leiden]] where he met [[Kammerlingh Onnes]] and was awarded a doctorate.

== Early life ==

Freeth was born on 2 January 1884 in Birkenhead. His father was a  [[master mariner]] and was an officer in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]; his great-grandfather, [[James Freeth]], was [[Quartermaster General]] between 1851 and 1854, and his grandfather was a major-general as well.{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=105}} He attended [[Audlem grammar school]] in [[Cheshire]] beginning in 1896; the next year, the [[Cheshire County Council|County Council]] built a laboratory at the school, sparking young Freeth's interest in the subject. He excelled at chemistry but had poor mathematical skills. On his second attempt, he passed the [[matriculation]] exam to study at [[Liverpool University]] from 1900, graduating with [[first-class honours]] in 1905 and then a [[master's degree]] in 1906.{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=106}} There, he studied under [[Frederick George Donnan]], a [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] who would be a great influence on Freeth, who was quickly gaining reputation as a chemist himself.{{r|New Scientist, 1958|Nature, 1938}}

== Brunner Mond  ==

After university, Freeth went to work at a factory belonging to [[Hitnetts Tobacco]],{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=106}} but did not enjoy the work;{{r|New Scientist, 1958}} he quit, and instead joined Brunner Mond on 25 September 1907. On his first day at Brunner Mond, he arrived with a cache of laboratory equipment that he had bought himself on credit.{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=106<U+2013>107}}

Freeth became the company's chief chemist in 1909, working at [[Winnington]] in [[Cheshire]].{{r|New Scientist, 1962|New Scientist, 1964}} In 1909, he was tasked with investigating the manufacture of [[ammonium nitrate]] for explosives; needing to read a paper by [[Franciscus Hubertus Schreinemakers]] in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he bought study materials for the language and quickly learned to read it. Freeth corresponded with Dutch chemists, joined the [[Dutch Chemical Society]] in 1911 and devoured the Dutch chemical literature in his areas of interest almost entirely by 1914.{{r|New Scientist, 1958|New Scientist, 1962}}{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=107}}

=== World War I ===

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Freeth was in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], having joined in 1912, and spent six weeks in the trenches in France with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] as a major{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=105, 107<U+2013>108}} in early 1915, but was then sent back to Britain to continue his armaments research at Brunner Mond at the direction of [[Lord Moulton]].{{r|New Scientist, 1958|Nature, 1938|New Scientist, 1964}} Germany, at the start of the war, had an advantage over Britain in their ability to manufacture explosives inexpensively: they had pioneered mixing ammonium nitrate and [[TNT]] to create [[amatol]], which was similar to pure TNT in effectiveness, and  understood the [[Haber-Bosch process]] and applied it in plants to produce the necessary nitrogen compounds.{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=108}}{{r|New Scientist, 1964}}

First, Freeth was charged with finding a way to purify TNT from hot alcoholic solution. Freeth invented a vacuum cooling process; it was, however, very risky, and led to the [[Silvertown explosion]] on 19 January 1917, which killed 73 people.{{r|New Scientist, 1958}}{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=108}} Writing in 1962, Freeth said that the process was "very dangerous"; a second, safer, process that he devised was implemented at [[Gadbrook]] and produced larger volumes of explosives.{{r|New Scientist, 1962}} The Gadbrook plant almost suffered a similar disaster, but two courageous Brunner Mond employees put out the fire before the plant exploded.{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=109}} Freeth wrote that he would, on a monthly basis, remind the Silvertown plant of the risk that the plant would explode, but that it was deemed "worth the risk".{{r|New Scientist, 1964}}

Second was the investigation of new ways to produce ammonium nitrate. Freeth built upon his pre-war work and implemented two processes he had devised in 1909 at an industrial scale in plants at [[Lostock Gralam]], [[Sandbach]] and a specialised factory in [[Swindon]].{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=108<U+2013>109}} For his work during the war, he was awarded an OBE in 1924.{{r|Nature, 1938|New Scientist, 1958}}

=== Dutch connections ===
Following his experience of the war, Freeth became convinced that the British chemical industry must conduct research itself, and he began on a project to recruit researchers, as well as cultivating closer links with academia, and arguing for theoretical underpinning for industrial research.{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=110<U+2013>111}}{{r|Travis, 1998}} He was also a proponent of a rigorous quantitative approach to chemistry, and used his excellent knowledge of [[phase rule]] chemistry to attract talent to Brunner Mond, particularly from prestigious instutitions like [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].{{sfn|Allen|1967|pp=14<U+2013>17}}{{r|Williams, 2009}}

In 1919, Freeth visited the [[Netherlands]] and visited [[Kammerlingh Onnes]]' laboratory in [[Leiden]], which was much more elaborate than his own. He maintained contact with Onnes, and also acquainted himself with [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Paul Ehrenfest]], [[Pieter Zeeman]], [[Albert Einstein]] and his original contact with the country, Schreinemakers.{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=111}}

Directed to investigate the [[fractionation]] of coke oven gas, Freeth was inspired by Onnes' low-temperature work; at his instigation, Brunner Mond set up a new low-temperature laboratory in Winnington in 1931 with a number of talented Dutch assistants, where [[polythene]] was later discovered. A number of Brunner Mond (and Imperial Chemical Industries) recruits went the other way, to the Netherlands to work with Onnes and increase the fruitful cross-pollination.{{r|New Scientist, 1958|Aftalion, 2001}}{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=111<U+2013>112}} Freeth was awarded a [[doctorate]] of the [[University of Leiden]] in 1924<U+2014>only possible thanks to a special decree of the Dutch Parliament<U+2014>and joined the [[Royal Society]] in 1926 on the recommendation of Donnan and Lord Moulton.{{r|Nature, 1938}}{{sfn|Allen|1976|p=112}}

== Imperial Chemical Industries and World War II ==

He stayed with the company after the merger that created Imperial Chemical Industries, despite being replaced as the research manager at Winnington by a non-chemist, [[Frank Bramwell]], in 1927; Freeth was given a higher post in [[London]], becoming Joint Research Manager with [[William Rintoul]], but the change stung and he did not relish the bureaucratic nature of his new role. He retired from his research post in 1938 after a breakdown in 1937, but still did work for the company as a consultant, in addition to secret work for the government.{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=113<U+2013>114}}

During [[World War II]], Freeth undertook secret research for the [[Special Operations Executive]], including developing materials for field use or for sabotage by commandos or resistance groups.{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=114<U+2013>116}} During this period of activity, he re-connected with friends within ICI and returned to the company as a University Liaison Officer on 1 February 1944, recruiting fresh talent for industrial chemical research. He retired again in 1952, this time to work lightly as a [[consultant]] and spend time with his family. Of the second spell at ICI, Freeth said, "These eight years were astonishingly happy and successful".{{r|New Scientist, 1958}}{{sfn|Allen|1976|pp=114<U+2013>116}}
