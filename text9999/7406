"'''Pilot'''" is the first episode of the television series ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]''; it premiered on [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] on September 13, 2005. It was written by series creator [[Eric Kripke]], and directed by [[David Nutter]]. The ''Supernatural'' [[Television pilot|pilot]] introduces the characters of [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] ([[Jared Padalecki]]) and [[Dean Winchester]] ([[Jensen Ackles]]), brothers who travel throughout the country hunting supernatural creatures, as they battle a ghostly [[La Llorona|Woman in White]] ([[Sarah Shahi]]) while searching for their missing father ([[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]).

Kripke had been developing the concept for ten years prior to it being greenlit as a television series. Before it could be filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. It was produced in [[Los Angeles]], though future episodes were filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], to save money. The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend [[Christopher Lennertz]]. The series premiere received mixed reviews, with critics praising the horror elements but having varying opinions of the lead actors' performances.

==Plot==
In Lawrence, Kansas, [[Mary Winchester]] ([[Samantha Smith (actress)|Samantha Smith]]) investigates a sound coming from her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure standing over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, [[John Winchester (Supernatural)|John]] (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She bursts into flames, and John is forced to evacuate the house with Sam and his older son, Dean.

Twenty-two years later, Sam (Padalecki) and his girlfriend [[Characters of Supernatural#Jessica Lee Moore|Jessica Moore]] ([[Adrianne Palicki]]) celebrate his high [[Law School Admission Test|LSAT]] score. Later that night, Dean shows up at Sam's home. Though the brothers have not spoken in years, Dean comes looking for help in finding their father, who disappeared while hunting a supernatural entity. After Sam hears a voicemail from his father that contains [[electronic voice phenomenon]] of a woman saying, "I can never go home," he agrees to help Dean in the search. The brothers head to John's last known whereabouts<U+2014>the town of Jericho<U+2014>where he had been investigating the disappearances of young men along a single stretch of road over ten years. Sam and Dean discover a local legend of a murdered girl who has returned as a homicidal, hitchhiking ghost. Research points to Constance Welch (Shahi), who jumped to her death off a nearby bridge after drowning her children. While they stakeout the bridge that night, Sam tells Dean he does not want to return to hunting supernatural creatures. He points out that finding whatever creature killed their mother<U+2014>a task their father has dedicated his life to<U+2014>will not bring her back. The two are interrupted by a ghostly woman jumping off the bridge. Sam and Dean later check into a local motel, and discover their father is also renting a room there. They break into it and discover his research scattered all over the room; all his findings point to Constance being a [[La Llorona|Woman in White]].

When Dean leaves the room to get food, he is arrested by the police, who believe he is connected to the disappearances. At the police station, they show him John's journal, and he notices the message "Dean 35-111" written inside it. As Dean is interrogated, Sam tracks down Constance's husband ([[Steve Railsback]]), and learns the locations of both her grave site and the house in which she drowned their children. Sam then fakes a 911 call so Dean can escape the station. However, Constance targets Sam in his car; she attempts to seduce him and requests he take her home. Sam acquiesces, and she attacks him once they arrive at her old house. Dean forces her to temporarily dissipate by shooting her with rock salt, and Sam uses the opportunity to crash the car into the house. Constance reappears and attacks them, but the spirits of her children confront her. They embrace their mother, and the family disappears.

Dean deduces John's message was coordinates to where he has headed. Sam still does not want to join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment. Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.

Series creator [[Eric Kripke]] had previously written for the [[The WB|WB]] series ''[[Tarzan (2003 TV series)|Tarzan]]'', and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for ''Supernatural'',<ref name="chills">{{cite web

===Cast and characters===
[[File:Jared and Jensen.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men wearing jeans and black shirts.|[[Jensen Ackles|Ackles]] (left) and [[Jared Padalecki|Padalecki]] (right) were the only actors to audition for the lead roles of Dean and Sam Winchester.]]
The pilot stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, whom Kripke likened to [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Han Solo]] of ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name="extra"/> Padalecki knew executive producers [[McG]] and Nutter,<ref name="newz">{{cite web|url=http://www.newzline.com/2007/02/07/supernatural-interview-with-jared-padalecki-sam-winchester/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080214205150/http://www.newzline.com/2007/02/07/supernatural-interview-with-jared-padalecki-sam-winchester/|archivedate=February 14, 2008|title=Supernatural interview with Jared Padalecki (Sam Winchester)|date=February 7, 2007|work=Newzline|accessdate=September 22, 2009}}</ref> the former convincing him to audition for the role.

To remedy the situation, [[Warner Bros.]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] suggested Ackles instead audition for Dean.<ref name="loreorder"/> Kripke agreed, believing Ackles' "smart-ass attitude" made him "born to play" the [[Harrison Ford]]-like character,<ref name="commentary">{{cite video|people=Various|date=September 5, 2006|title=Supernatural season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Pilot"|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Brothers Video}}</ref> and Ackles preferred the character of Dean after reading the script.<ref name="starc">{{cite web|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/12/tvnradio/1985443&sec=tvnradio|title=Jensen Ackles enjoys doing Supernatural|date=September 12, 2008|work=The Star Online|first=Mumtaj|last=Begum|accessdate=September 22, 2009}}</ref> Both actors were the only ones to audition, and network executives instantly noticed a brotherly chemistry between them.<ref name="p11">Knight, p.11</ref> ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]''-actor [[Bruce Campbell]] was Kripke's first choice to portray [[John Winchester (Supernatural)|John Winchester]], father of Sam and Dean.

With Morgan's scene taking place 22&nbsp;years before the series, he expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes, and was surprised when he was later asked to reprise the role.<ref name="p134">Knight, p.134</ref>

For the role of Constance Welch<U+2014>the Woman in White<U+2014>production set out to find the "perfect actress". Nutter, a fan of ''[[The L Word]]'', had watched an episode featuring actress [[Sarah Shahi]] one night during the casting process. He felt she was "really sharp" and a "fine actress", with a "seductive quality about her". Surprised when she came in to audition the following day, he knew she "had the job when she walked in the door".<ref name="commentary"/> Because the scene involving Constance's husband Joseph Welch merely discusses Constance's backstory, the scene hinged on the actors' performances. Seeking a "great actor", Nutter recalled his previous experience working with [[Steve Railsback]], and offered him the role.<ref name="commentary"/> Other guest stars include Adrianne Palicki as Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore, and Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. The latter felt she landed the part due to her joking around with Nutter during the audition.<ref name="p138">Knight, p.138</ref>

===Writing===
The episode was written by series creator Eric Kripke, who described its creation as a "very difficult, birthing process" due to the numerous rewrites required.<ref name="extra"/> The original version did not feature the Woman in White, and John Winchester died in the teaser.<ref name="extra"/> In the revised script, Sam and Dean Winchester were raised by their aunt and uncle instead of their father. Because of this, Sam is unaware that supernatural beings exist, and Dean must convince him of the truth when he asks for help. Kripke realized this made the backstory too complicated, and reworked it with co-executive producer Peter Johnson so that their father raised them to be hunters like him. This decision granted the brothers proficiency in both fighting and swindling people.<ref>Knight, pp.8<U+2013>10</ref> Other revised concepts included Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer who murdered their father,<ref name="p14">Knight, p.14</ref> and John dying instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica.<ref name="p11"/> The scene in which the brothers discuss their childhood and delve into their backstory was rewritten 20&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;times, and the final version was heavily trimmed.<ref name="commentary"/>

A gas-station scene within the episode was meant to establish what the brothers and the series are about<U+2014>bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared that it would be cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script.<ref name="commentary"/> For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the [[vanishing hitchhiker]], but combined it with the Mexican legend of [[La Llorona]] to give the spirit more motivation and characterization.<ref name="p26">Knight, p.26</ref> The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.<ref name="commentary"/>

Originally, the studio did not want Kripke to kill Jessica at the episode's end, but rather keep her as a recurring character in the series. Kripke felt this would not fit the series's format, and decided to have her revealed as a demon, with the revelation prompting Sam to join Dean in hunting. However, with only a short amount of screentime available to depict this, Kripke believed it would be a "tough aspect to sell".<ref name="p13"/> Because Luke Skywalker only begins his journey after the deaths of his aunt and uncle, Kripke found it more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be Jessica's death.<ref name="commentary"/> Thus, the character is killed in the same manner as Sam's mother, making the deaths the "right bookends".<ref name="p13">Knight, p.13</ref>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] for the pilot took place in [[Los Angeles]], though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]<ref name="p14"/> to save money.<ref name="mag">{{Cite news|first=Bryan|last=Cairns|title=Director's Cut: David Nutter|date=February, 2009|year=|periodical=Supernatural Magazine|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=8|pages=pp.40<U+2013>41|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The bridge sequences were shot at [[Lake Piru]],<ref name="commentary"/> near a ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' filming location,<ref name="mag"/> and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school.<ref name="commentary"/> Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production found it difficult to get them to cry on cue.

===Effects===
To depict the supernatural aspects of the show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Businesses, such as visual effects company Entity FX,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entityfx.com/credits.html|title=Credits|publisher=EntityFX|accessdate=September 28, 2009}}</ref> were contracted for production of the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes were filmed in Vancouver and required a new crew that works exclusively for the show.<ref name="effectsdvd">{{cite video|people=|title=Supernatural season 3 DVD featurette "From Legends to Reality"|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Home Video|date=2008}}</ref> Mary Winchester's death scene, which had the character pinned to the ceiling and burning to death, required actress Samantha Smith to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a fake body the crew named "Christina" was made out of wire and [[papier-m<U+00E2>ch<U+00E9>]], and was then ignited on a fake ceiling.<ref name="p138"/><ref name="p20">Knight, p.20</ref> However, the room quickly caught fire, forcing an evacuation.<ref name="p20"/> [[Chroma key|Green screen]] coincided with the visual effects for the ghostly Woman in White,<ref name="extra"/> and executive producer [[McG]] chose to make the imagery of her death sequence an homage to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s [[Aphex Twin]] video "[[Windowlicker#Music video|Windowlicker]]".<ref name="commentary"/> [[J-Horror|Japanese horror]] also influenced the scene, such as the school uniforms worn by the ghost children, the water cascading down the stairs, and the ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'' elements.<ref name="commentary"/>

===Music===
The episode's synthesized orchestral score was written by [[Christopher Lennertz]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Supernatural Music of Christopher Lennertz|publisher=Mania|url=http://www.mania.com/supernatural-music-christopher-lennertz_article_51827.html|accessdate=September 27, 2009|date=July 27, 2006|first=Randall D.|last=Larson}}</ref> Kripke's friend and next-door neighbor. The two attended [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] together, and worked together on various projects afterwards. Lennertz described ''Supernatural'' as "one of those dream situations where you get to work with someone who you admire, but also have a relationship with already", and noted he and Kripke "were already on the same page without even talking about [the series' music]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/Interviews/interview_christopher_lennertz_2006.htm|title=Christopher Lennertz Interview at Tracksounds: Moving in the Supernatural|publisher=Tracksounds!|date=|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

For the scenes involving Mary and Jessica's deaths at the hands of the demon [[Azazel (Supernatural)|Azazel]], Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations to create a "really nasty" sounding echo effect.<ref>Knight, p.21</ref> He would later reuse this theme in the season one episode "Nightmare".<ref>Knight, p.78</ref> The episode also included a number of rock songs,<ref name="p20"/> which would become a tradition for the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/hollywood-insider/5626/|title=Supernatural Creator Eric Kripke Answers Fan Questions <U+2013> Part I|publisher=Eclipse Magazine|date=April 23, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> Kripke wanted to feature the song "[[Enter Sandman]]", but [[Metallica]] would not grant permission.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Eric|last=Kripke|title=Ask Eric!|date=April, 2008|year=|periodical=Supernatural Magazine|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=3|page=96|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, the pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=092005_04|title=Weekly Program Rankings|date=September 20, 2005|publisher=ABC Medianet|accessdate=September 23, 2009}}</ref> The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Diana Steenbergen of [[IGN]], who was "hooked right away", gave the pilot episode a score of 8.5 out of 10. She felt it began "heartbreakingly", and the "genuinely scary" death scenes of Mary and Jess "will haunt...the viewers". Steenbergen praised both the writers and the lead actors for making the "[exposition scenes] still feel natural, for the most part", and noted Ackles and Padalecki were "instantly convincing as brothers". Also credited for this "well paced" episode was director David Nutter, who did an "excellent job of setting up the atmosphere and tone of the series".<ref>{{cite web|first=Diana|last=Steenbergen|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/861/861088p1.html|title=Supernatural: "Pilot" Review|publisher=IGN|date=March 20, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' deemed the series as possibly "the simplest and the scariest" of the season's new dark shows, and wrote, "It wants nothing more than to frighten you <U+2014> and tonight, it does." He noted the episode "[pulls] off a few surprises" and "works its way to an ending that lives up to Dean's 'no chick-flick moments'". However, Bianco criticized the "pauses for comic relief"; he felt Ackles' "comic touch" was "not yet as skillful as it needs to be", with Ackles' attempts at being "humorously annoying" leaving him "simply annoying".<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Bianco|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2005-09-12-supernatural_x.htm|title='Supernatural' frightens nicely|work=USA Today|date=September 12, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> Despite the episode having a somewhat unoriginal villain and a "relatively simple" solution, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' deemed the series' debut as "a promising plunge into the darkness". Lowry applauded Ackles, who "brings an easygoing charm and engaging wise-ass personality to the absurd notion of traveling the country with a trunk full of wooden stakes and holy water".<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Lowry|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117928111.html?categoryId=32&cs=1|title=Supernatural Review|work=Variety|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

Alessandra Stanley of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the first half of the episode "quite effective", with the "camera angles, spooky music and jumpy sequences...[being] as frightening as those found in any horror movie, with an added twist of suspense". However, she deemed the depiction of the ghostly villain as "pretty silly", and noted the second half "stops building suspense and turns predictable". Calling the series "Ghostbusters' Creek", Stanley felt the episode "reverts to a WB family drama about the bonds between two mismatched brothers and their father".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/13/arts/television/13stan.html?_r=1|title=Unexplained Phenomena Lurk Behind New Shows|work=The New York Times|date=September 13, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2010|first=Alessandra|last=Stanley}}</ref> Similarly, Matthew Gilbert of the ''Boston Globe'' called Ackles and Padalecki "generic cuties who hold their lips together tightly, except to utter the word {{'}}Dude{{'}}". Although Gilbert noted there are a couple "moderately creepy" twists, he found there to be "nothing about the central family story in ''Supernatural'' or its bland actors that makes it addictive".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2005/09/13/supernatural_goes_south_in_a_hurry/|title='Supernatural' goes south in a hurry|first=Matthew|last=Gilbert|work=The Boston Globe|date=September 13, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

Work on the pilot episode garnered two [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]] nominations in 2006. Lennertz was nominated in the category of "Outstanding Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore)",<ref name="emmy">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=&program=Supernatural&start_year=2006&end_year=2006&network=All&web_category=All&winner=All|title=Primetime Emmy Award Database|date=|publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|author=|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}</ref> and the sound editors<ref group="note">Michael Lawshe (Supervising Sound Editor), Timothy Cleveland (Sound Effects Editor), Paul Diller (Sound Effects Editor), Marc Meyer (Sound Effects Editor), David Lynch (Sound Effects Editor), Jessica Dickson (Dialog Editor), Karyn Foster (Dialog/ADR Editor), Chris McGeary (Music Editor), David Lee Fein (Foley Artist), and Jody Thomas (Foley Artist)</ref> for "Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series".<ref name="emmy"/>
