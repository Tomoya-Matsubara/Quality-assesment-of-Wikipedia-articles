==Plot==
A prohibitionist movement emerges in Springfield after [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] accidentally gets drunk during a [[St. Patrick's Day]] celebration. The municipal government discovers [[alcohol]] has actually been banned for two centuries, and moves to enforce the law, prompting [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] to [[Speakeasy|disguise his bar as a pet shop]]. With the town becoming impatient with the police's incompetence, [[Clancy Wiggum|Chief Wiggum]] is replaced by Rex Banner, an officer of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]].

In the meantime, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] figures out a way to keep Moe's bar operating, through [[rum-running|bootlegging]]. One night, he and Bart sneak out to the city dump to reclaim the beer that was disposed of when the Prohibition law began to be enforced. He then sets up shop in his basement pouring the beer into hollow [[bowling ball]]s. Using an intricate set of pipes under the Bowl-a-rama, he bowls the balls into [[Moe's Tavern|Moe's]]. Upon catching on, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] actually thinks it is a good idea (since Homer is actually using his intellectual faculties), though [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] refuses to believe that Homer is so actively violating Springfield law. The media realizes someone is allowing Springfield's underground alcohol trade to flourish, and they give the still-unknown Homer the nickname "Beer Baron". Rex Banner fails to catch the Baron and resorts to stopping people in the street to demand if they are the Beer Baron; he even arrests Ned Flanders who pleads guilty to drinking only root beer. 

When his supply of liquor runs out, Homer begins to [[moonshine|brew his own]]. However, his [[still]]s start to explode. He is then confronted by a desperate ex-Chief Wiggum. In an attempt to rekindle Wiggum's career, Homer allows the former Police Chief to turn him in. The punishment that awaits him is expulsion from the town (and presumably death) by an archaic [[catapult]], showing how anachronistic the law really was. Marge tells everyone that this law and punishment does not make sense and it is meaningless to punish Homer, especially for their freedom to drink. Rex Banner steps up to lecture the town on the reasons why the law must be upheld. While he lectures the assembled Springfield citizens, Wiggum has him catapulted and gets his job back. The town clerk then finds out that the Prohibition law was actually [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|repealed a year after it was put in place]], and so Homer is released. Within five minutes Fat Tony is only too happy to oblige when [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby]] asks him to flood the town with alcohol once more, and Springfield salutes its qualities as Homer announces, "To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0818.htm|title="Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment"|accessdate=2007-03-28|publisher= The Simpsons.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070314231733/http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0818.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-14}}</ref>

==Production==
The main plot of the episode is based on the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws of the 1920s, in which alcohol was banned in America.<ref name=Weinstein>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment"|medium=DVD|publisher= 20th Century Fox}}</ref> As ''The Simpsons'' has many episodes that have stories and jokes related to alcohol, the writers thought it was strange that they had never done an episode related to Prohibition, and that the idea seemed "perfect."<ref name=Weinstein/> The episode features a vast amount of [[Irish people|Irish]] stereotyping at the St. Patrick's Day celebration. This was a reference to when [[Conan O'Brien]] was a writer for the show, and his use of Irish stereotypes.<ref name=Weinstein/> Various writers were very concerned about Bart getting drunk. This was why he drank the beer through a horn, to show that it was only accidental.<ref name=Weinstein/> This was a toned down version of what was in John Swartzwelder's original script.<ref name=Groening>{{cite video|people=Groening, Matt|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Originally Chief Wiggum's first line was "They're either drunk or on the [[cocaine]]", but it was deemed too old-fashioned.<ref name=Silverman>{{cite video|people=Silverman, David|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The discovery of "more lines on the parchment" was a cheap way to get Homer freed and to end the episode.<ref name=Weinstein/>  

When Homer first enters Moe's "Pet Shop" the man that tips his hat to him outside was a resurrected character from the early seasons.<ref name=Silverman/> The riot at the beginning of the episode was taken from the end of "[[Lisa on Ice]]" and updated.<ref name=Anderson>{{cite video|people=Anderson, Bob|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The line "To alcohol! The cause of... and solution to... all of life's problems," was originally the act break line at the end of act two, but was moved to the very end of the episode.<ref name=Weinman>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh; Silverman, David|date=2006| title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment"|medium=DVD| publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>
