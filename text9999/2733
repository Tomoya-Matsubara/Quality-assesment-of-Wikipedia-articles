==History==
[[File:St Paul's Presbyterian Church, Christchurch, 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|left|St Paul's Presbyterian Church in 1885, with its high tower that was lowered in 1962]]
St Paul's was built in 1877 as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church on the corner of Cashel and Madras Streets in the [[Christchurch Central City]]. It replaced an earlier church on the corner of Lichfield and Madras Streets built by a breakaway congregation from St Andrew's Church. In 1969, St Paul's merged with the Trinity-Pacific church and since then was used by Pacific Islanders.<ref name="register St Paul's">{{NZHPT|305|St Paul's-Trinity-Pacific Church|6 August 2011}}</ref>

In August 2009, the church was the victim of an arson attack that caused considerable damage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Church fire deliberately lit|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2844157/Church-fire-deliberately-lit|accessdate=5 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=8 September 2009}}</ref> The building was restored, but suffered damage in the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]], and partially collapsed in the [[February 2011 Christchurch earthquake]].
