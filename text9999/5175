'''"Tallahassee"''' is the fifteenth episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 8)|eighth season]] of the American [[comedy]] [[television series]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' and the show's 167th episode overall. The episode aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on February 16, 2012. In this episode, Dwight returns to Tallahassee to meet with the president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram ([[Catherine Tate]]). Meanwhile, in Scranton, Andy fills in for reception and thoroughly enjoys himself.

"Tallahassee" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many reviewers noting that the "special projects" storyline helped to give the series a focus. The cold opening, in particular, received significant attention from critics, with many calling it the best of the show's eighth season. According to Nielsen Media Research, "Tallahassee" drew 4.38 million viewers and received a 2.3 rating/6% share in the 18-49 demographic, marking a twelve percent drop in ratings from the previous episode, "[[Special Project]]," and becoming the lowest rated episode of the series to air, beating the previous record holder, "[[Hot Girl (The Office)|Hot Girl]]." Despite this, it was the highest rated NBC series of the night.

==Plot==
[[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]), [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]), [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]), [[Cathy Simms|Cathy]] (Lindsey Broad), Ryan ([[B.J. Novak]]) and [[Erin Hannon|Erin]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) travel to Tallahassee as part of a [[Special Project|team picked for Sabre's new project]]. On the day of orientation, Dwight wakes everyone up at 5 o'clock in order to be ready. Jim, however, being used to two babies, has been up since 4 and decorates his room to look as if he had been murdered in order to prank Dwight, going as far as to writing "It was Dwight" on the wall in faux-blood. Dwight and Erin then walk in the room only to find it in ruins. Moments later, Jim lurches out of the closet as if he has been murdered.

At the orientation meeting, Dwight and Jim soon discover that [[Todd Packer]] ([[David Koechner]]) is still working at the company after [[Todd Packer (The Office)|the two of them attempted to get him fired]], which Packer has already realized. The president of Sabre's special projects, [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) begins to talk about the project, which encompasses creating a store to rival [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s chain of stores, and Dwight and Packer start to compete to see who will become her vice president. Dwight, however, develops an [[appendicitis]] and is rushed into surgery. However, three hours later, after getting his appendix removed, he returns in order to impress his new boss. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is "desire." Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day. Afterwards, [[Wally Amos]] of [[Famous Amos]] cookies (as himself) attempts to make a speech to the group, but is interrupted and ultimately eclipsed by the cookies he brought for the group.

Meanwhile in Scranton, the office is left without a receptionist. [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]) decides to fill in and pretends to thoroughly enjoy himself. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. [[Pam Halpert|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Darryl Philbin|Darryl]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) attempt to talk him out of his newfound "enjoyment," believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.

===Reviews===
"Tallahassee" received largely positive reviews from critics, with many noting that the Florida story-line gave the series a focus. ''TV Equals'' noted that the episode was "one of the best episodes of ''The Office'' this the season and [possibly] one of the better episodes from the last couple of seasons."<ref name=tvequals/> Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction -- and hope that maybe the series still has hope. [...] More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8."<ref>{{cite web|last=Marder|first=Brian|title='The Office' Recap: Tallahassee|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/The_Office_Recap_Tallahassee/17345619|publisher=Hollywood.com|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> Bret Davinger from the ''California Literary Review'' noted that "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about ''The Office'' spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?"<ref name=lit/> Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series.<ref name=lit/> In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent.<ref name=lit>{{cite news|last=Davinger|first=Bret|title=The Office Recap: Tallahassee (Season 8, Episode 15)|url=http://calitreview.com/23942|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=California Literary Review|date=17 February 2012}}</ref>  Jeffrey Hyatt from ''Screencrave'' awarded the album an 8 out of 10 and wrote that "between '[[Special Project]]' and 'Tallahassee' it<U+2019>s fair to say that ''The Office'' is on a nice little run.
