[[Bangladesh]] is [[Ethnic group|ethnically]] homogeneous, with 98% of the population being [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] (as are most in neighboring [[West Bengal]], [[India]]), though Bengalis are a heterogeneous and physically diverse ethnic group. They speak [[Bengali language|Bangla]], an eastern [[Indo-Aryan]] language. The remainder of the population is comprised mostly of [[Biharis]] and various tribal groups (concentrated in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]).

The [[religions]] practiced in the region have changed significantly through history. At various times in the distance past, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were each the dominant religions. The [[Partition of India | 1947 partition]] of Bengal along religious lines augmented the existing [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] majority in the region. The 1991 census provides the most recent estimate of the religious makeup, with 88.3% Muslim and 10.5% Hindu.<ref>The CIA World Factbook's figures are apparently in error. The 1990-1996 and 2001-2006 editions provide an estimate of 83% Muslim and 16% Hindu, but the 1997-2000 editions (as well as the 2005 Background Note from the US State Department) give the figures cited above.</ref> The balance is made up of Buddhists, [[Christians]] and [[animists]]. About [[Demographics of Islam | 5%]] of the Muslims (and most of the Biharis) are [[Shia]].

As in neighboring India, more than half of the population lives in [[agrarian]] rural villages. But urbanization is proceeding rapidly and the capitol [[Dhaka]] is one of the fastest growing and largest cities in the world. Other major urban centers include [[Chittagong]] and [[Khulna]].

The least densely populated areas are in the [[Sundarbans]] jungle and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Bangladesh had one of the highest rates of population growth in the world in the 1960's and 1970's. Since then however it has seen a marked reduction in its total [[fertility rate]], from 6.2 thirty years ago to 3.2 (2003 UNDP figures).

==Other Demographic Data==

Naturally there is some degree of uncertainty about the population, especially in a developing country such as Bangladesh with a high level of illiteracy and rural population. Thus the margin of error is such that it is unknown which of Bangladesh and [[Russia]] has the larger population. For example the UN's ESA ranks Russia 7th and Bangladesh 8th, whereas the CIA World Factbook ranks Bangladesh 7th and Russia 8th. At any rate, the population of Russia is in decline while that of Bangladesh is growing. The following table lists various recent estimates of the population.
