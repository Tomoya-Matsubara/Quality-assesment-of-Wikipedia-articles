== History ==

=== Department stores ===

From as early as the 1930s, the site was home to a [[Foy & Gibson]] department store, which was known by the locals as '''Foys'''.<ref name="Gervas"/> The store featured a popular cafeteria and extended all the way through from St Georges Terrace to [[Hay Street, Perth|Hay Street]].<ref name="Gervas"/>

{{cquote|It too had great areas of window display with island windows beyond the street frontage.|200|50|Stan Gervas|''Perth in the 1930's and "The Way We Were"''<ref name="Gervas">{{cite book |last=Gervas |first=Stan |title=Perth in the 1930's and "The Way We Were" |year=1994 |publisher=Stan Gervas Books |location=[[Maylands, Western Australia|Maylands]] |pages=5-6 }}</ref>}}

The store changed to a [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]] department store upon the purchase by that chain of Foy's Western Australian operations. By the late 1970s, David Jones had withdrawn from the Western Australian market, and the site stood vacant after decades as a landmark of St Georges Terrace.<ref name="Down">{{cite news |author=Staff writer |title=After eight years of standing idle: down, down she comes |curly=y |work=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] |page=11 |date=3 October 1986 |accessdaymonth=9 November |accessyear=2008 }}</ref>
The site was later acquired by Central Park Developments, a joint venture of the Superannuation Board of Western Australia, [[Bond Corporation]] and [[Laurie Connell|L. R. Connell and Partners]], and in 1986 had a value of [[Australian dollar|A$]]20 million.<ref name="Down"/>

=== Planning approval ===

A planned $150 million redevelopment of the {{convert|1.5|ha|acre|adj=on}} site<ref name="Down"/> was announced in October 1985.<ref name="Wainwright1985">{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Wainwright |title=$150m. tower for DJ site |curly=y |work=[[The West Australian]] |page=1 |date=26 October 1985 }}</ref> The plans included a 45-storey office tower, underground car parking, a landscaped park and the extension of the Hay Street Mall westwards to alongside the development.<ref name="Wainwright1985"/>
Demolition of the site had started by October 1986, by which time the planned tower had been expanded slightly to 47 floors.<ref name="Down"/>

The 1987 approval of the redevelopment by the [[City of Perth|Perth City Council]] was controversial. The Council's own Town Planning Scheme imposed a limit on the number of parking bays in the central business district to ensure that the city streets could handle increased traffic levels coming from extra parking.<ref name="Wainwright1987">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Wainwright |title=Tower bonuses worry councillor |curly=y |work=[[The West Australian]] |page=2 |date=9 October 1987 }}</ref>
Under the Scheme the site was only entitled to 300 car parking bays.<ref name="Bodeker">{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Bodeker |title=Tower Car Park Anger |curly=y |work=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] |page=13 |date=29 September 1987 }}</ref>
The developers sought approval for 1175 car parking bays, which Council planning experts had said would cause traffic to back up to [[King Street, Perth|King Street]] waiting for entry.<ref name="Wainwright1987-2">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Wainwright |title=PCC passes tower for old DJ's site |curly=y |work=[[The West Australian]] |page=3 |date=20 October 1987 }}</ref>
The Council wanted the developers to consider constructing a road tunnel from [[Mounts Bay Road, Perth|Mounts Bay Road]] to the underground parking to reduce traffic congestion around the tower, however the developers only agreed to consider building a pedestrian underpass beneath St Georges Terrace.<ref name="Bodeker"/>

The final planning approval for the redevelopment was ultimately passed by the Council in an 18&ndash;9 decision on 19 October 1987, after a discussion of over two hours.<ref name="Wainwright1987-2"/> The Council made various planning concessions to allow the development to have 1175 car parking bays and exceed the allowable [[Floor Area Ratio|plot ratio]]. The Council allowed the developers to transfer 15 storeys worth of plot ratio from the landscaped park at the corner of William and Hay streets, and gave bonuses of 10 storeys for actually building the park and 4 storeys for the public space and the quality of the development.<ref name="Wainwright1987"/> As a result, more than half of the tower's eventual 51 floors came from these planning concessions.<ref name="Wainwright1987"/> Councillors Peter Gallagher, Les Johnston and Michael Hale argued that the approval of the redevelopment set a "dangerous precedent",<ref name="Wainwright1987-2"/> and the State's Planning Minister Bob Pearce said that the building was "too big" and that the Council should not have granted the extra parking bays to the developers.<ref name="Wainwright1987"/> At the time of the planning approval, the site was owned by [[AMP Limited|AMP]], the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] and Central Park Developments (the Bond-Connell corporation).<ref name="Bodeker"/> The [[Government of Western Australia|State Government]] approved the plans in November 1987 and the construction contract was awarded to [[Multiplex (company)|Multiplex]].<ref name="Leading"/>

=== Construction: 1988 to 1992 ===

Construction on the tower started in 1988,<ref name="Leading">{{cite book |author=Roger and Barbara Andrew (eds.) |title=Western Australia &mdash; leading in the new millennium |year=2000 |publisher=Andrew Publishing House |location=[[Roleystone, Western Australia|Roleystone]] |isbn=095778421X |pages=201-202 |chapter=A city within a city }}</ref>
with South Perth firm Bruechle Gilchrist & Evans as the project engineers.<ref name="Writs">{{cite news |first=Neale |last=Prior |title=Multiplex Writs Fly Over Central Park |curly=y |work=[[The West Australian]] |page=46 |date=1 January 2000 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }} </ref>
The building was constructed in a [[Modular design|modular]] method, whereby floor slabs were [[precast concrete|pre-cast]] off-site and simply dropped into the steel frame of the tower as construction progressed.<ref name="Leading"/> Over {{convert|60000|m2|sqft|abbr=on|lk=on}} of pre-cast floor units, both rectangular and triangular, were supplied for use in Central Park, the largest such contract ever awarded to an Australian company.<ref name="CCD6">[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], p 6</ref>
The modular construction principle even extended to the [[washroom|restrooms]] of the tower: they arrived on the building site as completely enclosed modules, ready to be fixed into position on each floor and have external services connected.<ref name="CCD76">[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], p 76</ref>

Major structural work on Central Park concluded with the installation in 1992 of its communications mast.<ref name="Tops"/> The first tenants, accounting firm [[BDO Kendalls|BDO Nelson Parkhill]], moved in to their offices in May 1992, followed by further tenants including [[Ernst & Young]] in December 1992.<ref name="Tops"/> Following structural completion of the tower, the public park was landscaped in early 1993.<ref name="Tops"/>

Construction of Central Park cost $186.5 million, and upon completion the building overtook the [[R&I Tower]] (now the BankWest Tower) as the tallest skyscraper in Perth.<ref name="Tops"/> It was also the city's largest office tower by combined floor area,<ref name="Tops"/> a title which was taken by [[QV1 Tower|QV1]] when that building opened in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ruth |last=Callaghan |title=Tall Story Is Lost On US Liquidator |curly=y |work=[[The West Australian]] |page=58 |date=17 January 1998 |accessdate=10 November 2008 |quote=At 40,000sq m the building, the first Perth CBD office development since Central Park was completed in late 1992, would be bigger than Exchange Plaza and the same size as the BankWest tower. QV1 is the biggest. }} </ref>

=== Post-construction ===

Since its completion, Central Park has been regarded as one of Perth's leading premium office towers.<ref name="Leading"/> However, in the years following its opening Central Park faced a sluggish office rental market and experienced high vacancy rates for several years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ingrid |last=Mansell |title=Few Signs Of Big Cranes On The Horizon |curly=y |publisher=[[The West Australian]] |page=57 |date=28 August 1996 |accessdate=10 November 2008 |quote=As for another tower to add to Perth's skyline, Mr Ryan said he believed it would take at least seven years to rebuild investor confidence, which was rattled by the high vacancy rates that followed the construction of QV1 and Central Park. }} </ref>

In September 1999, during a heavy storm some domes in the canopy over the building's forecourt became dislodged, causing the closure of St Georges Terrace. This led to the building's then-owner, the Government Employees Superannuation Board, initiating legal action against builder Multiplex.<ref name="Writs"/>

The tower now has a stated {{convert|66500|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of office and retail space across 51 occupied floors.<ref name="Specs">{{cite web |url=http://www.central-park.com.au/Public/General/pub_execSummary.asp |title=Central Park: Building Specifications |accessdate=10 November 2008 |publisher=Central Park }}</ref> Major current tenants include miners [[Rio Tinto]] and [[BHP Billiton]], law firms [[Minter Ellison]] and [[Mallesons Stephen Jaques]], and accounting firm [[KPMG]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.central-park.com.au/Public/Contact/TenantContacts.asp?View=P |title=Central Park - Tenants |accessdate=10 November 2008 |publisher=Central Park }}</ref> [[St George Bank]] also occupies some space in the building and in 2007 the St George logo was installed at the top of the tower.

Since 2001, the tower has played host to an annual stair climb race up 53 flights of stairs to the roof.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stair climb inaugural year a success |curly=y |work=Central Park Times |publisher=Central Park |page=1 |date=September 2001 }} </ref>
In 2008 the event raised $103,719 for MS Australia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charity success stories at Central Park: MS Stair Climb |curly=y |url=http://www.central-park.com.au/Images/Newsletter/Central%20Park%20Times%20-%20Spring%202008.pdf |format=PDF |work=Central Park Times |publisher=Central Park |location=Perth |page=1 |date=Spring 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008 }}

== Design ==

Central Park was the fourth and largest stage in the plan by architects Forbes & Fitzhardinge for the surrounding commercial precinct, which included the AMP Building, the Commonwealth Bank building and the Wesley Centre.<ref name="CCD7">[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], p 7</ref>
The design of the tower changed several times as the prospect of different planning concessions changed.

[[Image:Central Park tower.jpg|thumb|right|Two of the triangular side wings of the tower, seen with the outriggers above them which provide added stability to the structure.]]
The tower as ultimately built has a composite steel and concrete frame featuring a pre-stressed, reinforced slip-form concrete core, which is stiffened by an outrigger [[truss]] at the top of the tower<ref name="CCD6"/> and at the various side setbacks.<ref name="Wind">{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Kermode |title=City Streets Go With The Wind |curly=y |work=[[The West Australian]] |page=57 |date=7 August 1996 |accessdate=10 November 2008 |quote=The big "Meccano set" out-riggers which bolt on to the sides of Central Park were an example of one method used to stiffen buildings. "It is still moving about a third of a metre but people don't tend to notice the vibrations," Dr Kavanagh said. }} </ref>
At the time of its completion, Central Park was the tallest core-stiffened building in Australia.<ref name="Leading"/> The core stiffening method minimises the sway of the building in winds, which even after the core stiffening is around {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the tower's top.<ref name="Wind"/>

The use of a service core structure for the building minimised the number of internal columns were needed, with only two on the largest floors,<ref name="CCD76"/> which maximised usable space.<ref name="CCD71">[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], p 71</ref> The {{convert|1200|mm|in|adj=on}} diameter columns for the tower are made of composite steel and concrete,<ref name="CCD6"/> encased within a permanent formwork of Spiroduct tubing.<ref name="CCD76"/> The pre-cast floor slabs are supported by fire-treated steel beams and provided with a composite action by in-situ topping.<ref name="CCD6"/>

The profile of the building has multiple [[setback (architecture)|setbacks]], to provide for variable floor areas to cater to the needs of different tenants.<ref>[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], pp 6-7</ref> The plan of the tower is based upon a square, with two triangular wings extending from opposite sides. The building was oriented to make best use of the relatively narrow frontage onto St Georges Terrace.<ref name="CCD11">[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], p 11</ref> The tower is clad with [[aluminium]] and glass curtain walls.<ref name="CCD7"/> The building has 5,000 sheets of glass, which get cleaned twice per year.<ref name="Confessions"/> Because of high winds, it can take up to 3 months to complete one window-washing circuit of the building.<ref name="Confessions">{{cite news |first=Monica |last=Videnieks |title=Confessions of a Window Cleaner |curly=y |work=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]], Sunday supplement |page=1-2 |date=23 February 1997 |accessdate=11 November 2008 }}</ref> To clean the exterior faces of the building, the window cleaners have to move vertically over {{convert|10|km|mi}}.<ref name="CCD76"/>

Central Park was noted upon its opening for being technologically advanced, with "fully computerised air conditioning", which uses data from 1,400 sensors on each floor to regulate temperatures in an energy-efficient way.<ref name="CCD71"/> From its uppermost floors, there are views out to [[Kings Park]]<ref name="Lungs"/> and the [[Indian Ocean]]. However, members of the public are not permitted to observe from the building except on designated charity days.

The [[podium]] of the building is clad with stone to complement the surrounding street frontages,<ref name="CCD7"/> and the foyer is decorated with [[mural]]s by artist Brian McKay<ref name="CCD7"/> on {{convert|223|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of aluminium wall panels.<ref name="CCD11"/><ref>{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Brian |title=Central Park Murals |series=The Architect (Western Australia) |volume=1991 No. 1 |date= |year=1991 |pages=8 }}</ref> In addition to the {{convert|64000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space, {{convert|3000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of retail space and 1030 basement car parking bays in the project at completion, the site also includes a {{convert|5000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} landscaped park,<ref>[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], p 5</ref> which leads towards the intended focal point of the precinct, the restored Wesley Church on the opposite side of Hay Street.<ref name="CCD7"/> The architects intended the park to act as a "breathing space in the hard linear nature of the Hay Street Mall".<ref>[[#CCD|Corporate Construction & Design]], p 8</ref> The park contains sunken seated areas and raised grassed areas, as well as a fountain as the centrepiece. There are also drink fountains and a large plaza area which provides a pedestrian thoroughfare to [[St Georges Terrace]]. It has been variously described as "magnificent", "one of the few green strips in the city outside the grassed area on the river foreshore",<ref name="Leading"/> the "green lungs of the city",<ref name="Lungs">{{cite news |first=Di |last=Therese |title=Soar points: All this and an average temperature in the low 30s |curly=y |work=[[Herald Sun|Sunday Herald Sun]] |page=20 |date=28 June 1998 |accessdate=10 November 2008 |quote=The park has been dubbed the green lungs of the city and the building described as "an office block, but a fancy one at that".

and "a backyard-sized patch of grass".<ref>{{cite news |first=Joan |last=Kerr |title=City as artform |curly=y |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |page=42 |date=11 July 1992 |accessdate=10 November 2008 |quote=Perth's Central Park, for instance, was marketed as a "New Heart for Perth", with trees, parks, birds and water interacting with decorative panels, sculptures and murals, but it finally became just a 51-storey tower (the highest in the city) with a solitary mural and a backyard-sized patch of grass. }} </ref>
