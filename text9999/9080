'''Ogof y Daren Cilau''' is one of several [[cave|cave system]]s in the [[Llangattock (Crickhowell)|Llangattock]] [[escarpment]] near [[Crickhowell]] in south [[Powys]], [[Wales]].

Its awkward 517m entrance crawl is a natural barrier to any casual visitor and precludes the need for a locked gate to protect it from vandals.  

Highlights of Daren Cilau include the ''Time Machine'', the largest cave passage in Britain; the ''White Company'', a set of pure white [[stalactite]]s; and the ''Bonsai Tree'', a branching [[helictite]].

Due to the extent of the passages several kilometres from the entrance which would require trips of up to 20 hours to explore, two permanent underground camps have been established: the ''Hard Rock Cafe'', and the ''Restaurant at the End of the Universe''.

The major breakthrough into the system beyond the entrance series occurred in 1984, before which the cave consisted of little more than the entrance series and several uninspiring passages.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}  

In 1986 [[Martyn Farr]] connected the Terminal Sump to Elm Hole in the next valley by [[cave diving]].[http://www.darencilau.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1&Itemid=36]

After decades of work and numerous [[cave digging]] projects, a connection to the nearby cave [[Ogof Agen Allwedd]] is yet to be found.
