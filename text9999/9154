'''John Day Fossil Beds National Monument''' is a {{convert|13,944|acre|adj=on}} park in eastern [[Oregon]]. Located within the [[John Day River]] Basin, this [[U.S. National Monument]] is world renowned for its well preserved, remarkably complete record of [[fossil]] plants and animals, a record that spans more than 40 of the 65 million years of the [[Cenozoic Era]] (also known as the Age of [[Mammal]]s and [[Angiosperm|Flowering Plants]]). The monument is divided into three units: [[Painted Hills]] (named for the delicately colored [[Stratigraphy|stratifications]]) northwest of [[Mitchell, Oregon|Mitchell]], Sheep Rock which is northwest of [[Dayville, Oregon|Dayville]], and Clarno which is {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of [[Fossil, Oregon|Fossil]]. Blue Basin is a [[volcanic ash]] bowl transformed into claystone by eons of [[erosion]], colored pastel blue by [[mineral]]s.

Visitors can follow trails into the [[badland]]s and examine fossils displayed at the visitor center while [[scientist]]s continue field investigations and the painstaking analysis of the monument's vast fossil record.  The Sheep Rock unit includes the '''Thomas Condon Paleontology Center''' with exhibits of fossils, and the [[James Cant Ranch Historic District|Cant Ranch Museum]] which serves as the monument's headquarters and includes exhibits about human settlements on the ranch and in the area.  The museums are located 2 miles (3.2 km) miles north of Picture Gorge along Route 19 near [[Dayville, Oregon|Dayville]].

Exploration and study of the John Day fossil beds continues today. In many of the beds, the fossils are widely scattered, and their occurrence cannot be predicted. Many types of fossils deteriorate rapidly once erosion exposes them to the elements. Thus the fossil beds are continually canvassed by paleontologists. Visitors often take rocks as souvenirs, which is a federal crime.<ref>

The fossil beds contain vestiges of the actual soils, rivers, ponds, watering holes, mudslides, ashfalls, [[floodplain]]s, [[midden]]s, [[fossil trackway|trackway]]s, [[prairie]]s, and forests, in an unbroken sequence that is one of the longest continuous geological records. The rocks are rich with the evidence of ancient habitats and the dynamic processes that shaped them; they tell of sweeping changes in the John Day Basin. Great changes, too, have taken place in this area's landscape, climate, and in the kinds of plants and animals that have inhabited it.

== History ==

[[File:Clarno palisades 2.jpg|thumb|left|Palisades at the Clarno Unit of the monument]]
People have lived in Oregon for more than 10,000 years. Evidence suggests that [[Sahaptin people|Sahaptin]] groups such as the [[Warm Springs tribes|Warm Springs]], [[Umatilla tribe|Umatilla]] and [[Wasco-Wishram|Wasco]] inhabited the north-central part of the state. Surveys have found 36 sites of archeological interest, including rock shelters and [[cairn]]s, in or adjacent to the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. Most significant among the prehistoric sites are the Picture Gorge [[pictogram|pictograph]]s, consisting of six panels of rock art in the canyon at the south end of the Sheep Rock Unit. By the 18th&nbsp;century, [[Paiute people|Northern Paiutes]] had also moved into the region from further south and lived in the upper John Day basin. All of these peoples were hunter-gatherers subsisting on local resources such as as [[salmon]], deer, [[elk]], [[Camassia quamash|camas]], and [[huckleberry|huckleberries]].<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 1">Beckham and Lentz, Ch. 1: "Indigenous Peoples and Cultures", pages not numbered.</ref>  

The John Day basin remained largely unexplored by non-natives until the mid-19th&nbsp;century. [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]], who noted the John Day River while traveling along the Columbia River in 1805, did not ascend it. [[John Day (trapper)|John Day]], for whom the river is named, apparently visited only its confluence with the Columbia in 1812. In 1829, [[Peter Skene Ogden]], working for the [[Hudson Bay Company]] (HBC), led a company of explorers and fur trappers along the river through what would later become the Sheep Rock Unit. [[John Work]] of the HBC also visited this part of the river in 1831.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 2">Beckham and Lentz, Ch. 2, "Early Explorations and Expeditions", pages not numbered.</ref>   

In the 1840s, thousands of settlers began emigrating west over the [[Oregon Trail]]. Subsequent clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to [[Indian reservation|reservation]]s, including three in north-central Oregon: [[Warm Springs Indian Reservation|Warm Springs]], [[Burns Paiute Tribe|Burns Paiute]], and [[Umatilla Indian Reservation|Umatilla]].<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 4">Beckham and Lentz, Ch. 4, "Settlement", pages not numbered.</ref> After passage of the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, more non-natives moved to the region, established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 4"/>  Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] on the Columbia River to mines at [[Canyon City, Oregon|Canyon City]] in the upper John Day valley.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 5"/> By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as the The Dalles<U+2013>Boise Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 5">Beckham and Lentz, Ch. 5, "Transportation", pages not numbered.</ref>

[[File:Thomas condon of oregon.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Thomas Condon]]]]
In 1864, a company of soldiers sent to protect mining camps from raids by Northern Paiutes discovered fossils in the [[Crooked River (Oregon)|Crooked River]] region, south of the John Day basin. One of their leaders, Captain [[John M. Drake]], collected some of these fossils for [[Thomas Condon]], a missionary pastor and amateur geologist who lived in The Dalles.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 4"/> Recognizing the scientific importance of the fossils, Condon accompanied soldiers traveling through the region, where he discovered rich fossil beds along Bridge Creek and near Sheep Rock in 1865. Condon's subsequent trips to the area and his public lectures and reports about his finds led to wide interest in the fossil beds among scientists such as [[Edward Drinker Cope]] of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] and paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Othneil C. Marsh]] of [[Yale University|Yale]], who accompanied Condon on a trip to the region in 1871. Condon's work led to his appointment in 1872 as Oregon's first State Geologist and to international fame for the fossil beds. Specimens from the beds were sent to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and other museums worldwide, and by 1900 more than 100 articles and books had been published about the John Day Fossil Beds. During the first half of the 20th&nbsp;century, scientists such as [[John C. Merriam]], Ralph Chaney, Frank H. Knowlton, and Alonzo W. Hancock continued work in the fossil beds, including those discovered near Clarno in about 1890.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 7">Beckham and Lentz, Ch. 7, "Paleontological Exploration", pages not numbered.</ref> 

Remote and arid, the John Day basin near the fossil beds slowly attracted homesteaders.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 4"/> The first settler in what became the Sheep Rock Unit is thought to have been Frank Butler, who built a cabin along the river in 1877.<ref>McArthur, p. 131</ref> In 1881, Eli Casey Officer began grazing sheep on a homestead claim in same general area.<ref>{{cite web|title=History & Culture|url=http://www.nps.gov/joda/historyculture/index.htm|publisher = National Park Service|accessdate=July 14, 2011}}</ref> His son Floyd later lived there with his family and sometimes accompanied Condon on his fossil hunts.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 4"/> In 1910, James and Elizabeth Cant bought {{convert|700|acre|ha}} from the Officers<ref name="Places">{{cite web|title=Places|url=http://www.nps.gov/joda/historyculture/places.htm|publisher = National Park Service|accessdate=July 14, 2011}}</ref> and converted it to a sheep ranch, which was eventually expanded to a sheep-and-cattle ranch of about {{convert|6000|acre|ha}}.<ref name="Hard Places, Ch. 4"/>

===Park creation===

==Geology==

[[File:Joda geologic timeline.png|thumb|right|Timeline for major rock formations in the monument]] The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument lies within the Blue Mountains [[physiographic province]], which originated during the late [[Jurassic]] and early [[Cretaceous]], about 118 to 93&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>Bishop, p. 65</ref> Northeastern Oregon was assembled in large blocks (exotic [[terrane]]s) of [[Permian]], [[Triassic]], and [[Jurassic]] rock shifted by [[Tectonics|tectonic]] forces and [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] to what was then the western edge of the North American continent, near the Idaho border.<ref>Orr, p. 21</ref> By the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] era, 65&nbsp;million years ago, the Blue Mountains province was uplifting and eroding, and the Pacific Ocean shoreline, formerly near [[Idaho]], lay west of the new province.<ref>Orr, p. 29</ref>

Volcanic eruptions about 44 million years ago during the [[Eocene]] deposited lavas accompanied by mud flows ([[lahar]]s) atop the older rocks in the western part of the province. The mudflows of shales, [[siltstone]]s, conglomerates, and [[breccia]]s entombed plants and animals caught in their paths and later eroded into rock formations such as those exposed in the Clarno Unit.<ref>Orr, pp. 30, 46</ref> Preserved in the nut beds, palisades, and other formations of the unit are fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts, fruits, roots, branches, and seeds.<ref name="geology fieldnotes">{{cite web|title=Geology Fieldnotes|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/joda/#geology|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref> Large animals inhabiting this region between 50 and 35 million years ago included [[Browsing (herbivory)|browser]]s such as [[brontothere]]s and [[amynodont]]s, scavengers like the [[Hyaenodontidae|hyaenodont]]s, as well as [[Patriofelis]] and other predators.<ref name="geology fieldnotes"/> Eroded remnants of the Clarno [[stratovolcano]]es, once the size of [[Mount Hood]], are still visible near the monument, for example Black Butte, White Butte, and other [[butte]]s near [[Mitchell, Oregon|Mitchell]].<ref>Bishop, 86<U+2013>92</ref> 

The Clarno volcanics subsided by the early [[Oligocene]] but were replaced about 36 million years ago by eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of what much later became the [[Cascade Range]].<ref name="Orr 30-31"/> The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno mudflows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many eruptions extending into the early [[Miocene]] (about 20&nbsp;million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color.<ref name="Orr 30-31"/> Laid down on top of the Clarno Formation (from the Clarno volcanics), the John Day Formation (from the John Day volcanics) consists of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost, the Big Basin member, consists of highly oxidized and deep red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit and the nearby Bridge Creek Flora site, with its ''[[Metasequoia]]'' (dawn redwood) fossils.<ref>Orr, pp. 30<U+2013>31, 46</ref> The Turtle Cove member above it is mainly pea-green clay. Resting atop the Turtle Cove member are the buff-colored Kimberly and Haystack members.<ref name="Orr 30-31">Orr, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref> Fossils found in the John Day Formation include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 kinds of mammals, including dogs, cats, swine, [[oreodont]]s, horses, camels, and rodents.<ref name="geology fieldnotes"/>  

After another period of erosion, a series of lava eruptions from fissures across northeastern Oregon, southeastern Washington, and western Idaho inundated much of the Blue Mountain province with liquid [[basalt]]. Extruded in the middle Miocene between 17 and 12&nbsp;million years ago, more than 40 separate flows contributing to the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]] have been identified, the largest of which involved up to {{convert|400|mi3|km3}} of lava. The most prominent of these formations within the monument is the Picture Gorge Basalt, which rests above the John Day Formation.<ref>Orr, p. 32</ref>

Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in the late Miocene contributed to the Mascall Formation, a layer of stream-deposited volcanic [[tuff]]s laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt.<ref name="Orr 33">Orr, p. 33</ref> Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of horses, antelope, camels, bears, broadleaf plants, and other life forms that thrived in the monument's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="geology fieldnotes"/><ref name="Orr 33"/> The last major eruption in the late Miocene deposited the Rattlesnake Formation, capped by an [[ignimbrite]], on top of the Mascall.<ref name="Orr 34">Orr, p. 34</ref> The Rattlesnake has fossils of [[mastodon]]s, camels, rhinoceroses, and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time.<ref name="geology fieldnotes"/><ref name="Orr 34"/>
