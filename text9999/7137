==History==

The Fabric Workshop and Museum was founded in 1977 by Marion Boulton Stroud.  Stroud<U+2019>s goal was to create a non-profit workshop that combined team-work and innovation. The Artists in Residency program provided space, tools and assistance for the artists to make functional objects through screen printing on fabric. When FWM saw that artists ideas, especially the installation based, were being stifled in the process of translating their ideas into a functional objects, they dropped that principle and allowed the work to be non-functional as well.  The rules bent more and more as years went on, allowing artists to expand on the word <U+201C>fabric<U+201D>. The team of FWM staff and artists have now created work using everything from wire mesh, horse hair and fiberglass. They have exhibited outside of their own space, from [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] to New York, Venice, London, Dakar and Los Angelous.The FWM has and will always strive to push artists in new directions, opening their eyes to see anything  they think up can be done. The FWM has said <U+201C>we can do anything, and we have the talent, knowledge and resources to accomplish what we set out to do."<ref>Boulton, Marion. New Material as New Media: The Fabric Workshop and Museum. Philadelphia, The Fabric Workshop and Museum, 2002.</ref><br />In 1996, when the collection of documentation and work created by Artists in Residence grew, it became apparent that this work was historically important and needed to be displayed to the public as well as cared for.  The Fabric Workshop became <U+201C>The Fabric Workshop and Museum<U+201D>, and now has a permanent collection of over 5,500 objects created by more than 400 artists.<br />Due to the expansion of their neighbor, The Philadelphia Convention Center, The Fabric Workshop and Museum has changed its location three times. Its current location is 1214 Arch Street.<ref>www.fabricworkshop.org</ref><ref>Boulton,Marion.New Material as New Media:The Fabric Workshop and Museum.Philadelphia: The Fabric Workshop and Museum, 2002.</ref>

==Workshop==
The Fabric Workshop and Museums Artist in Residency program consists of national and internationally known contemporary artists. The artists, who may be emerging or established, experiment and explore varies materials and techniques.  The Artistic Director invites artists to participate in Artist in Residence Program after consulting with the Fabric Workshop and Museum Artist Advisory Committee.  The Committee meets 1-2 times a year to select candidates for residency.<br />This program brings together conceptual painters, sculptors, architects, and designers, and also includes installation art, performance and video. FWM supplies all the funding and materials to the artists. Artists work with an FWM staff of printers and technicians. If a project requires additional staff, FWM may hire desired professionals. Artists may also bring their own assistants for their projects. Artists are exposed to new techniques, materials and recourses not accessible to them previously. This creative collaboration opens possibilities for the artist<U+2019>s own work as well as it introduces innovations to expand the limits of contemporary art. In the previous location of FWM it was possible to visit the facilities where the artists work. The new location does not continue this tradition, but there is an option to schedule a special tour.<ref>www.fabricworkshop.org/</ref>
