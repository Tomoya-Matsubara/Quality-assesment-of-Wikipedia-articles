'''[[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]]''' was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team tour of England in 1948]], which went undefeated in their 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a touring side earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''. 

==Early matches==
Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].<ref name=haigh/> Johnson had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since the [[Second World War]], so he was a natural selection.

Johnson took 3/52 from 23 overs, the most of any bowler, cleaning up the lower order as Australia removed the hosts for 233.<Ref name=worcs>{{cite web

|title = Worcestershire v Australians
|publisher = [[CricketArchive]]
|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}</ref> When Australia batted, Johnson came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten 12 as Australia declared at 8/462. The hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete victory by an innings and 17 runs. Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/75 from 13.3 overs, although he was the most uneconomical bowler among those who sent down more than three overs.<ref name=worcs/>

Johnson played a key part in the next match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. He made six at No. 8 as Australia made 448. Johnson came on with the hosts at 3/74 and took two quick wickets in the space of five runs, beginning a collapse that led to Leicestershire being all out for 130. He ended with 2/50 from 23 overs. Australia enforced the [[follow on]], and Johnson broke through their top and middle order. The hosts reached 0/45 before Johnson took the first five wickets to fall to reduce them to 5/88. They then progressed to 5/113 before Johnson took two more wickets in the space of four balls. Johnson ended with 7/42 from 21 overs, his best first-class innings figures, as Leicestershire were out for 147, handing Australia victory by an innings and 171 runs.<Ref name=sched/><ref name=leics>{{cite web

Johnson then returned in the next match against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]] in [[London]], where Australia won the toss and batted first.<Ref name=o/><Ref name=sched/> Batting at No. 6, Johnson came in at 4/444 and put on 99 runs with vice-captain and fellow [[South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbournian]] [[Lindsay Hassett]], before falling for 46. Australia were eventually bowled out for 632. Johnson then took five wickets in helping to cut down Surrey's first innings. The hosts reached 2/40 before Johnson took three middle order wickets to reduce them to 6/66. He then took the final two wickets to end with 5/53 from 18.2 overs. Surrey were bowled out for 141 and forced to follow on and Johnson took 3/40 in the second innings as they made
195 to cede victory to Australia by an innings. He had removed captain [[Errol Holmes]] and [[Stuart Surridge]] in both matches.<Ref name=surrey>{{cite web

Bradman enforced the follow on and Johnson had more success on the second attempt. The hosts had reached 3/128 when Johnson caused a middle-order collapse. He had [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] Test batsman [[Martin Donnelly]] stumped by [[Don Tallon]], before trapping leading English Test batsman [[Len Hutton]] five runs later. He then removed [[Ken Cranston]] to leave the MCC at 6/159. Johnson ended with 3/37 as Australia bowled out the home side for 205 to win by an innings, also catching [[Denis Compton]] from the pace bowling of [[Ray Lindwall]].<Ref name=o/><Ref name=mcc/> 

The MCC match was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]].<ref name=sched/><Ref name=o/> Johnson had little to do.

On the third day, Australia had reached 5/305 when Johnson came to the bat. He made 21 with three fours, including an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by [[Jim Laker]]. Johnson hit the ball onto his foot and it rolled back into his stumps.<ref name=f94>Fingleton, p. 94.</ref> This left Australia at 6/338 but the lower order continued to score and pushed the total to 509, giving the tourists a 344-run lead.<Ref name=sco1/>

Late in the day, after scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from Johnson. He did not read the [[arm ball]] that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England 2/39.<Ref name="sco1"/><Ref name="report1"/><Ref name=f97>Fingleton, p. 97.</ref> [[Denis Compton]] came in and he ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly block the ball on the run.

Compton appeared resigned to his fate ready to walk, but umpire Chester declined the appeal.<Ref name=f97/> England closed the day at 2/121.<ref name=sco1/>
 
On the fourth day the light was again poor, but England did not appeal against the light. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility so that he could erase the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a [[sticky wicket]], Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface.<Ref name=f101/> Bradman thought that rain might come so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively with [[leg theory]] so that England would not have a lead should a sticky wicket arise.<Ref name=f101>Fingleton, p. 101.</ref>

Soon after reaching his century, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but was dropped by Johnson.<ref name=f102>Fingleton, p. 102.</ref> Compton went on to make 184 and England were eventually out for 441 on the final day. Johnson had sent down 42 overs for a return of 1/66.

Between Tests, Johnson played the match against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]], which started the day after the Test.

On the fourth day, Johnson came in at 6/445, with Australia already leading by 580.

Johnson returned for the following match against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] before the Third Test.<Ref name=sched/><ref name=o/> Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour,<Ref name=sched/> underpinning a victory by an innings and 363 runs. Johnson made 27, after coming in at 6/669 and playing a supporting role in a 105-run partnership with [[Sam Loxton]], who made 159 not out. Hassett declared without further addition to the score after Johnson fell.<Ref name=gloucs/> Johnson then played a leading role with the ball, taking his only ten-wicket match haul for the tour.<Ref name=o/> After the openers had put on 74, Johnson removed both in quick succession to leave the hosts at 2/79. He then took the last three wickets as Gloucestershire fell from 6/257 to be all out for 269. Johnson had totalled 6/68 from 31.4 overs and Hassett elected to enforce the follow on. The home side reached 2/72 when Johnson took five of the last eight wickets to bowl them out for 132.

==Third Test==
{{main|Third Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
The teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]], their reserve opener who had batted out of position in the middle order and scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings.<Ref name="sco1"/><Ref name="sco2"/> Brown was replaced by the all rounder [[Sam Loxton]].<Ref name="sco3"/> Brown's omission was to unexpectedly alter Johnson's playing role.

Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and consolidated their innings after falling to 2/28.<Ref name=sco3/> When Johnson was bowling after the pacemen had taken the ball, [[Jack Crapp]] hit three driven boundaries from Johnson in quick succession, which prompted Bradman to take the new ball at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to be 5/119.<ref name="report3">{{Cite web|title= Third Test Match ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152896.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref><ref name=f132>Fingleton, p. 132.</ref> Soon after, Yardley lofted [[Ernie Toshack]] into the on-side into the hands of Johnson to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141.<ref name=f171>Fingleton, p. 171.</ref><Ref name=sco3/> 

On the second morning, English tailender [[Dick Pollard]] came to the crease and pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes stood closer than most in that position in support of the spinner, almost on the edge of the cut strip and was unable to evade the ball.<ref name=f136/> Barnes "dropped like a fallen tree",<ref name=f136>Fingleton, p. 136.</ref> and had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.<Ref name="report3"/> England eventually reached 363, with Johnson sending down 38 overs without success and conceding 77 runs.<Ref name="sco3"/>

England came out for the their second innings and Johnson bowled only seven overs on the third afternoon as England closed at 3/174 from 69 overs, with Bradman relying on his seamers.<Ref name=sco3/> Late in the day, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack when he was on 80,<Ref name="report3"/><Ref name=f144>Fingleton, p. 144.</ref> and he reached dstumps unbeaten on 85.<Ref name=sco3/> Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting as rain delayed the start on the final day.<Ref name=report3/> Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.<ref name=sco3/>

Play began after the tea break, with Australia needing score 317 in the last session or England needing to take ten wickets. The pitch played very slowly with the excess moisture. With Australia not looking to chase the runs, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions.<ref name=f146>Fingleton, p. 146.</ref> In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and had scored only six runs. [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]] replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp to fall for six to leave Australia 1/10.<Ref name=f146/><ref name=sco3/> Australia then batted for another two hours without further loss to reach 1/92 from 61 overs when the match was finally put out of its misery by a series of periodic rain interruptions.<Ref name=f146/> Johnson had an unhappy game, scoring seven runs in two innings, dropping a catch and taking match figures of 0/93.<ref name=sco3/><ref name=f144/>

After the Test, Johnson was rested for the victory over [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] by ten wickets in Australia's only county match between Tests.<Ref name=sched/><Ref name=o/>

==Fourth Test==
{{main|Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
The teams then headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two changes for the Test.<ref name="sco4"/><ref name="sco3"/> Harvey came in for Barnes,<ref>Perry (2002), p. 101.</ref> while Saggers replaced Tallon, who had a finger injury, behind the stumps. Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Thus Australia jettisoned the experiment of opening the batting with Johnson, who had managed one and six in the previous match.<Ref name=sco3/><Ref name=sco4/> 

England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch,<Ref name="report4"/><Ref name="sco4"/> that was seen as being unhelpful to [[fast bowling]].<Ref name=f154>Fingleton, p. 154.</ref> England brought up 150 without loss, 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief interruptions due to rain. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.<Ref name=f152>Fingleton, p. 152.</ref> Bradman brought on Johnson, who had delivered only three overs to this point, the rest of the proceedings having been through fast bowlers.<Ref name=f153>Fingleton, p. 153.</ref> Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman set a defensive ring field for Johnson, with no slip. While Johnson bowled two consecutive maidens, but Washbrook was scoring freely at the other end, so Bradman then called for the new ball and brought back the fast bowlers.<ref name=f152/> Johnson was still wicketless as England closed the day at 2/268.<Ref name=sco4/> [[Jack Fingleton]] said that Australia's day went "progressively downhill" and was its worst day of bowling since the [[Second World War]], citing the proliferation of full tosses.<ref name=f154/> The next morning, England progressed strongly. Nightwatchman hit three consecutive fours from Toshack, prompting Bradman to replaced him with Johnson. Bedser surveyed Johnson's wares for one over before Johnson into the leg side in the next over three times, yielding a [[six (cricket)|six]] and two fours. Johnson was then removed from the attack. When he came back, Edrich hit him for another six to reach 96. However, Johnson soon had his revenge. England reached 2/423 when Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson, patting the ball back when he could have hit it decisively. This ended a 155-run third-wicket partnership. Edrich then attempted to pull Johnson to the on side but only hit it in the air to Morris,<Ref name=f157>Fingleton, p. 157.</ref> who completed the catch. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 4/426.<Ref name=sco4/> Johnson's two wickets precipitated a collapse and England were all out for 496.<Ref name=sco4/> He ended with 2/89 from 33 overs, but he was the most uneconomical of the frontline bowlers except for Toshack, who broke down with a knee injury.<Ref>Cashman, pp. 299&ndash;300.</ref>

Johnson came in at 5/294 in Australia's innings when Harvey departed for 112, but he made only 10 before falling at 6/329. Lindwall replaced him and made 77 as Australia's tail pushed the score to 458 on the fourth morning, reducing the deficit to 38.<Ref name=sco4/> In the second innings, Johnson continued to be punished, with both Washbrook and Hutton lofting him for sixes in quick succession, and Bradman pulled him out of the attack.<Ref name=f169>Fingleton, p. 169.</ref> When Johnson returned, Hutton hit him in the air again, but this time the batsman was by Bradman on the run for 57, leaving England at 2/129.<Ref name="sco4"/><Ref name=f170/> Edrich and Compton came in and were pinned down, but after 45 minutes, Compton charged Johnson and heaved him to the leg side for a boundary.<Ref name=f170>Fingleton, p. 170.</ref> Bradman promptly took the new ball as England reached 2/209 at tea. After the break, Johnson continued to be targeted by England. Edrich hit three consecutive fours before lofting a fourth into the crowd for six.<Ref name=f171/> England reached 2/232 before collapsing to be 8/362 at the end of the day, but Johnson was unable to take any more wickets.<Ref name=sco4/>

England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley [[Declaration and forfeiture|declared]] at 8/365.<Ref name="report4"/><ref name="sco4"/> Johnson had taken 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the bowlers. He conceded 4.04 runs per over while the others averaged 3.26.<Ref name="sco4"/> Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.<Ref name="report4">">{{Cite web|title= Fourth Test Match ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref>

This left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, but they reached it with 15 minutes to spare and seven wickets in hand to seal the series 3&ndash;0.<ref name="b ashes">Perry (2001), pp. 84&ndash;89.</ref><Ref name=sco4/><ref name=report4/>

Johnson was the most economical Australian in the first innings against  [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]. He took 3/29 from 22.3 overs as the hosts fell for 138.

Johnson was given a light bowling load in the first innings, sending down only five overs, but he removed three of the last four wickets to end with 3/5 as the hosts fell for 130.

==Post-Test matches==
Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.<Ref name=sched/> Johnson returned and made 15 of 361 as Australia batted against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by an innings. Johnson was not asked to bowl as the first four bowlers used cut down the hosts' first innings for 51 in just 23 overs. It was a similar tale in the second innings, with the pacemen doing the early damage. Johnson bowled briefly, sending down 4.5 overs and removing the last two batsmen to end with 2/15 as the hosts fell for 124 in 32.5 overs.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only a limited number of Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,<ref>Perry (2005), pp. 253&ndash;254.</ref> with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, with Johnson taking 3/45, his victims being Donnelly, Yardley and former Test batsman [[Laurie Fishlock]]. He also caught [[Freddie Brown]] and [[Jim Laker]] from the bowling of Lindwall.<ref name=lg/> Johnson then made 38 as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. Johnson took both wickets of Hutton and Fishlock, ending with 2/12.<Ref name=sco5/><Ref name=lg>{{cite web

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. Johnson made a duck in Australia's 236 in the first match. He then bowled a total of 17 overs and took 3/26 as Australia won by an innings. In the second match, Johnson took 3/26 from 20.2 overs as Scotland made 178. He was then promoted to No. 5 and came in at 3/96 and hit 95 as Australia reached 6/407 declared. In the second innings, Johnson was unable to add a wicket in his final opportunity for the tour, taking 0/6 from three overs. However, when it became obvious that Australia was in an unassailable position, Bradman allowed wicket-keeper [[Don Tallon]] to bowl, and he took 2/15. In the meantime, Johnson stepped in with the gloves and he completed a stumping from the leg spin of [[Doug Ring]] as Australia finished the tour with another innings victory.<Ref name=sched/><Ref name=o/><Ref name=scot1>{{cite web

==Post-tour assessment==
''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' noted that while Johnson had started the tour well, he was not as effective in English conditions as Australian.<ref name="Wisden1948">{{cite web| year = 1949| url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155254.html?from=login| title = England 0 Australia 4: Australians in England, 1948| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher = John Wisden & Co| accessdate = 2008-05-28}}</ref> {{quote|[Johnson] was not so troublesome to batsmen in Tests as when at home, principally because of the difference in pace of the pitches and his inability to bowl round the wicket, an almost essential part in the make-up of an off-spinner in England.
