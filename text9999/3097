'''Buffalo River State Park''' is a [[state park]] of [[Minnesota]], United States, conserving a [[prairie]] bisected by the wooded banks of the [[Buffalo River (Minnesota)|Buffalo River]].  Together with the adjacent '''Bluestem Prairie Scientific and Natural Area''' owned by [[The Nature Conservancy]], it protects one of the largest and highest-quality prairie remnants in Minnesota.<ref name=Website />  With the closest swimming lake to the [[Fargo<U+2013>Moorhead]] metropolitan area, however, it is most popular for swimming and picnicking.<ref name=Plan />  The {{convert|1068|acre|ha|adj=on}} park is located just off [[U.S. Route 10]] in [[Clay County, Minnesota|Clay County]], {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} east of [[Glyndon, Minnesota|Glyndon]] and {{convert|14|mi|km}} east of the [[Moorhead, Minnesota|Moorhead]].<ref name=Brochure />

Buffalo River State Park was established in 1937 and developed by the [[Works Progress Administration]].  Three buildings and three structures built in the [[National Park Service rustic]] style were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989.  The park was originally focused on providing outdoor recreation amenities like the swimming pool, since there were few other opportunities in the area.<ref name=MHS />  It was expanded beginning in the 1960s as the quality and rarity of the surrounding prairie were recognized.<ref name=Meyer />

The {{convert|6078|acre|ha|adj=on}} Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) section is used for [[environmental education]] by local schools and regional colleges and universities.  It is also a destination for viewing the spring courtship ritual of the [[Greater Prairie Chicken|greater prairie chicken]].<ref name=TNC />

==Natural history==
===Geology===
The topography of Buffalo River/Bluestem Prairie largely formed beneath a [[proglacial lake]] at the end of the [[last glacial period]].  The region had previously been covered and exposed many times by successive glaciations.  As the ice of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] melted, the [[Red River Valley]] was covered by [[Glacial Lake Agassiz]] 10,000<U+2013>8,000 years ago.<ref name=Plan />  Fine sediments formed a distinctly level lakebed.  However [[beach ridge]]s of sand and gravel formed in various places as the shorelines shifted.<ref name=Brochure />  There is a beach ridge on the east edge of the state park called Campbell Ridge, and another to the southeast in the SNA called Norcross Ridge.  The [[bedrock]]<U+2014>a thin layer of [[shale]] over [[granite]], [[slate]], and [[schist]]<U+2014>lies beneath {{convert|250|-|500|ft|m}} of silt deposited by Lake Agassiz.  The lake finally drained away to the north, leaving behind a distinctly flat plain with very rich soil.<ref name=Plan />

Today the park slopes slightly westward, dropping {{convert|100|ft|m}} in elevation from its eastern border to its western border.  The fairly flat prairie is interrupted by the two sandy beach ridges and associated rolling hills.  Where it crosses the ridges the Buffalo River has formed steep and unstable [[cut bank]]s up to {{convert|30|ft|m}} high.  A few [[glacial erratic]]s stud the prairie.<ref name=Plan />

===Flora===
The Buffalo River and Bluestem prairies preserve one of the largest remnants of [[northern tall grasslands]], an ecoregion largely confined to the Red River Valley.  The prairie is of high quality, much of it never having been cultivated.<ref name=TNC />  It is characterized by [[Andropogon gerardii|big bluestem]] and [[Schizachyrium scoparium|little bluestem]] interspersed with [[forb]]s like [[Rudbeckia|coneflowers]], [[Liatris|blazing star]], and [[Dalea|prairie clover]].<ref name=Plan />  Some 250 species of wildflowers and grasses have been cataloged in the park.<ref name=Brochure />  Rare plants include [[Tofieldia glutinosa|sticky false-asphodel]], [[Cypripedium candidum|small white lady's slipper]], [[Gentianella amarella|northern gentian]], [[Calamagrostis montanensis|plains reedgrass]], [[Gaillardia|blanket flower]], and the endangered [[Platanthera praeclara|western prairie fringed orchid]].<ref name=TNC />  [[Yucca]]s and [[cactus|cacti]] can be found at the south end of the property.<ref name=Plan />

A [[gallery forest]] extends across the prairie on either side of the Buffalo River.  It is characterized by [[elm]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]], [[oak]], and [[Tilia americana|basswood]].<ref name=Website />  The [[understory]] comprises young basswood, ash, and elm along with [[Acer negundo|boxelder]], [[hazel]], and [[gooseberry]].  The drier soil along the lip of the riverbank supports [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur oak]].  Patches of [[willow]], [[aspen]], and boxelder occur on the prairie in spots with poor drainage.<ref name=Plan />

===Fauna===
200 species of bird and 40 species of mammal have been documented in Buffalo River State Park.  Mammals include [[moose]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[coyote]]s, [[red fox]]es, [[American badger|badgers]], [[white-tailed jackrabbit]]s, [[North American beaver|beavers]], [[plains pocket mouse|plains pocket mice]], and [[Onychomys leucogaster|northern grasshopper mice]].<ref name=Website />  Several uncommon prairie birds find refuge in the park, including [[Greater Prairie Chicken|greater prairie chickens]], [[Marbled Godwit|marbled godwits]], and [[Upland Sandpiper|upland sandpipers]].<ref name=Website />  Also present are [[Sandhill Crane|sandhill cranes]], [[Loggerhead Shrike|loggerhead shrikes]], and [[Henslow's Sparrow|Henslow's sparrows]].<ref name=TNC />  Other vertebrates include the [[Great Plains toad]] and [[Heterodon nasicus|western hognose snake]].<ref name=Plan /><ref name=TNC />  Three rare butterflies have been documented in the prairie: the [[Regal Fritillary]], [[Oarisma poweshiek|Powesheik skipper]], and [[Dakota skipper]].<ref name=TNC />

==Cultural history==
===Native American history===
[[American bison]] reliably wintered on the site of the future park, prompting [[Ojibwe people]] to call a stream ''Pijijiwizbi'', meaning "Buffalo River."  Although this originally referred only to a [[tributary]] of the modern Buffalo River, settlers misapplied the name to the larger waterway.<ref name=Brochure />  Far back into prehistory, Native Americans commonly used the river and beach ridges as travel corridors.  The [[Minnesota Historical Society]] has postulated that the park is likely to contain archaeological resources, but little research has been done.<ref name=Plan />

===Settlement===
Euro-Americans arrived in the 1820s and recognized the fertile prairie soil as ideal farmland.  A leg of the [[Red River Trails]] followed the ancient route along Campbell Ridge in the vicinity of the park.  Bowing to mounting pressures against their traditional lifestyle, the local Ojibwe ceded the region to the United States in their [[Treaty of Washington (1855)#Treaty with the Chippewa|1855 Treaty of Washington]].<ref name=Brochure />

In 1864 work began on the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] across the northern United States.  Rail access brought [[homesteaders]] to the area in the 1870s.  In 1875 J.H Smyser, who'd served as a captain in the Union Army during the [[American Civil War]], purchased much of the future park property for a horse and cattle ranch.  His impressive 1875 manor stood on the grounds for many years but burned down in 1959.<ref name=Brochure />  Most of the land was used for pasture and hayfields rather than crop farming, which had the effect of preserving more of the native species.<ref name=Plan />

To reduce a taxing gradient for their trains, Northern Pacific in 1906 began building the massive [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]] that still marks the park's northern border.<ref name=Brochure />  

===Park creation and development===
Buffalo River State Park was created in the late 1930s, taking advantage of federal [[job creation program]]s during the [[Great Depression]].  The Moorhead Rod and Gun Club championed the site and the [[Minnesota Legislature]] officially added it to the state park system in 1937.<ref name=Meyer />  At the time it was the only state-owned recreational facility in the region.<ref name=MHS />  The [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) established a camp and began developing the park's original {{convert|122|acre|ha}}.  WPA workmen established infrastructure like the swimming area, entrance road, parking area, water supply, and toilets.<ref name=Meyer />  They also built a bath house, a latrine, and a diversion dam in the [[National Park Service rustic]] style using split stone and logs.<ref name=MHS />

The original boundaries of the park were drawn with an emphasis on recreation.<ref name=MHS />  As recognition grew of the size and quality of the surrounding prairie, the park was expanded in the 1960s.  [[The Nature Conservancy]] purchased additional land south of the park beginning in 1975.<ref name=TNC />  The Nature Conservancy's property lies partly within the state park's official boundaries and partly without.<ref name=Plan />

==Recreation==
[[Image:Buffalo River State Park swimming pool.JPG|right|thumb|Buffalo River State Park's swimming pool and bath house]]
Buffalo River State Park sees high local use, particularly for its swimming pool.  Overnight visitors, conversely, are often far from home and using the park as a stopover on the way to a farther destination.  Many campers come from [[Canada]] or [[the Dakotas]].<ref name=Plan />  The campground has 44 sites<U+2014>35 with electric hookups<U+2014>plus showers, flush toilets, and a [[holding tank dump station|dump station]].  A separate group camp accommodates up to 50 people.<ref name=Website />  The campground, picnic area, and swimming pool are located in the shade of the forest.<ref name=Brochure />  

The swimming pool features a sand bottom, filtered water, lifeguards, accessible features, and is surrounded by an artificial beach.  The Buffalo River provides fishing opportunities.<ref name=Website />

There are {{convert|12|mi|km}} of hiking trails, {{convert|6|mi|km}} of which are [[snow grooming|groomed]] for [[cross-country skiing]] in winter.  The rest of the park is open to [[snowshoe]]rs.<ref name=Website />  In March and April The Nature Conservancy operates two viewing blinds from which visitors can observe the dramatic [[lek mating]] ritual of the greater prairie chicken.<ref name=Checklist />
