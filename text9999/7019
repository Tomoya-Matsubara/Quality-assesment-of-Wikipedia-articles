'''Scouting in Ontario''' has a long history, from the [[1900s]] to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. In [[1955]], the [[8th World Scout Jamboree]] was held at [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], [[Ontario]]. This was the first World Jamboree to be held in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The setting was a rolling parkland, and 11,000 Scouts attended this gathering, which was notable for the number of Scout contingents that crossed the Atlantic by air to attend-1,000 from [[Great Britain]] alone.

Canada has several associations which trace their roots to the [[Baden-Powell Scouts]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. They form the [[Canadian Federation of Independent Scouting]], which is a member of the [[World Federation of Independent Scouts]]. Members of the federation include the [http://www.traditionalexplorers.on.ca/ Traditional Explorers Association Council of Ontario].

===Haliburton Scout Reserve===

'''Haliburton Scout Reserve''' (HSR) is a 20 square [[kilometre]] (5000 [[acre]]) [[Scouting|Scout]] camp located east of [[Haliburton, Ontario]] and just south of [[Algonquin Park]]. The camp opened in 1947 and is operated by [[Scouts Canada]], [[Scouting in Ontario|Greater Toronto Council]]. HSR is located in a part of the [[Canadian Shield]] with 13 lakes and a multitude of birds, fish, and animals. Centred around Kennabi Lake are 22 campsites accessible by water. Scout troops normally come to the camp for week-long summer camps. HSR staff provide numerous programs for troops.

====History====
Following [[World War II]], Toronto Scout District (now Greater Toronto Council) wanted a rugged site for Scout camping. Their camping committee eventually located a 4150 acre (16.8 km<U+00B2>) site owned by the [[Mill Valley Lumber Company]], which was completing cutting in that area. The property was purchased in the fall of 1946 and opened the following summer as Camp Kennabi. Many of the original lumber camp buildings are still in use. The first [[Camp Chief]] was Field [[Commissioner]] [[James C. Moore]], after whom Moore Lake and the J. C. Trail are now named.

Starting in 1953, a composite camp, called Camp Kennaway, was run on the site. Camp Kennaway and Camp Kennabi merged in 1960 to form Haliburton Scout Reserve. Over the years, various plots of land were added to the original purchase. Over the years, thousands of Scouts from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries have visited the camp.

====Program====
=====Staffed programs=====
HSR's trained staff run a variety of programs during the week. Programs include:

* [[Sailing]] lessons
* [[Kayak]] lessons
* [[Shooting sports|Riflery]] with [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 calibre rifles]] on a 22 [[metre|m]] (25 [[yard]]) range
* [[Archery]]
* Trapper's Cabin <U+2014> Scouts visit a reconstructed cabin from the fur trapping era and learn about [[Trapping (Animal)|trapping]] and [[logging]], both of which were practiced on the land that is now HSR.
* Survival Island <U+2014> Scouts learn about building shelters, purifying water, and how to become found if one is lost in the woods.
* [[Rappelling]]
* [[Climbing wall|Climbing Wall]]
* Snorkel Island <U+2014> Scouts don mask, [[snorkel]], and flippers and search for treasures in the water near the island.
* Star Hike <U+2014> Troops travel to the middle of Kennabi Lake to look at the stars and hear stories about the constellations, if they stay awake.
* Badge Trading <U+2014> Scouts gather at the Hub on Tuesday evening to trade badges.

=====HSR Regatta=====
Thursday afternoon is the HSR [[Regatta]]. Troops gather at the Hub to compete in a variety of water-based activities. The events normally include:

* Queen Boat Race <U+2014> teams of eight Scouts and one Scouter paddle [[lifeboat]]s in a race
* PFD Swim <U+2014> Swimming while wearing a PFD (Personal Flotation Device)
* Match Swim <U+2014> Contestants must swim from one dock to another carrying a match. The winner is the first to light their match. Matches are normally carried in the mouth to keep them dry.
* Medly Swim <U+2014> Four Scouts swim in a relay, each using a different stroke.
* In and Out Canoe Race <U+2014> Scouts race canoes. When a whistle is blown, Scouts must jump out then climb back in before continuing.
* Canoe Sculling Race <U+2014> Scouts race three to a canoe without paddles using their hands for propulsion.
* Skipper's Taxi <U+2014> Two Scouts race in [[rowboat]]s, one Scout on each [[oar]]. A Scouter sits at the back and directs the steering.
* Canoe-Over-Canoe Race <U+2014> Four Scouts with two canoes from each site race. When a whistle is blown, one canoe must swamp and be rescued by the other using [[canoe-over-canoe rescue]].

=====Program resources=====
Scouts can use canoes, [[kayaks]], sailboats, [[rowboat]]s, and lifeboats. Kennabi Lake offers excellent [[fishing]]. There are many day trips available including visiting the logging museum in Algonquin Park, seeing undomesticated [[wolves]] at the [[Haliburton Wildlife Forest and Wildlife Reserve]], watching logs being processed at the [[Wilberforce Lumber and Veneer Company]], and visiting the abandoned [[Richardson Mine]].

=====Hiking=====
HSR has an extensive network of marked hiking trails and outpost campsites, ideal for overnight hikes. Hiking trails wind their way through forests and over rock formations typical of the Canadian Shield. One can often see wildlife, such as deer on these hikes. Popular hiking destinations include High Falls, where one can have a shower under the waterfall; Pike's Peak, the highest point in HSR offering a fantastic view; and Hurst Lake, where there is a large shelter and a supply of canoes.

====Facilities====
The central facility at HSR is called the Hub. Here is the Trading Post with souvenirs, snacks, and a small amount of camping equipment. Nearby is the Dobson Centre, where the Country Store is located. The Country Store stocks a full line of food and can make special orders. A pay phone is available nearby. The camp clinic is staffed by a doctor and nurse.

Around Kennabi Lake and on its many islands are 22 troop campsites. Each of these includes a dock, swimming area, picnic tables, ground cooler for food, internal telephone, outdoor [[kybo]]s, rowboats, campfire circle, and several patrol sites. There are also nine family/guest campsites with road access, drinking water, picnic tables, and fire pits. Some are suitable for trailers.

====Typical week====
Scout troops arrive at camp every Saturday in July and August. After checking in at the office, the troop gets [[Personal flotation device|PFDs]] from the Ab Shack, and loads themselves and their gear on to a [[pontoon]] barge which takes them into Kennabi Lake to their campsite. The rest of the day is spent setting up camp.

On Sunday morning, one [[Scouter]] from each site attends the Skippers' Meeting at the Hub. Scouts come to the Hub later by barge in the morning. They get [[canoe]]s, [[paddle]]s, and a brief lesson from HSR staff before paddling back to their campsite. The Scouts will use the canoes to get around for the remainder of the week. Troops often take Sunday afternoon to learn more about canoeing and water safety, and to complete setting up their campsites.

Regular programs run Monday to Friday. Troops build their own program from the staff-run activities and programs they run themselves.

On Friday, troops often have a closing banquet on their site. In the evening, they bring their canoes back to the Hub and attend the closing campfire. After the campfire, they return to their campsite by barge. 

On Saturday, each campsite is inspected by HSR staff. Once inspection is complete, troops load their gear onto the barge, return to the loading docks, and head for home.

===Tinnerman Canoe Base===
'''Tinnerman Wilderness Canoe Base''', more commonly known as Tinnerman Canoe Base, is a "high-adventure base" located on the banks of the [[French River]] in Ontario. Since [[1963]] the base has been owned and opperated by the Greater Cleveland Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].

Tinnerman is nicknamed the ''Land of the Joli Voyageur''.

====History====
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the French River area was a major trade route used to exchange furs trapped in the West with various goods made in the East and in Europe.
The Land that the Tinnerman base is located on was owned by [[Albert H. Tinnerman]], inventor of the [[speed nut]].

====Boy Scout ownership====
After Mr. Tinnerman's passing in 1961, his grandson tried to obtain a commercial license for the camp. The Ontario government said that any one area would support only so many camps and they felt the lower French had enough camps at that time. Though appealed, a license was not possible for the camp. 

It was at this time the family decided to donate the camp to the Cleveland, Ohio Area Boy Scout Council. Interestingly enough, two weeks after the formal donation, Mr. Buttriss received a letter from the Ontario government stating that since one of the Camps in the area had closed its doors (Rainbow Lodge on Bass Creek), the license would now be available. 

===129th Toronto Scouting Group===
[[image:129logo.png|right]]
The '''129th Toronto Scouting Group''' (also known as the '''Queer Toronto Scouting Group''') was believed to be the first group worldwide exclusively for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth and adults. The group was founded by gay activist [[Bonte Minnema]] and chartered by [[Scouts Canada]] in [[1999 in Canada|1999]]. Consistent with Scouts Canada policy, the group was [[co-ed]]. It made world [[headlines]], including the [[BBC World News]], when a story by [[Reuters]] first brought attention to the group's existence.

In [[October 1999]], [[United States|American]] [[Pastor]] [[Fred Phelps]] and his congregation at the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] planned to protest outside the [[Ontario]] offices of Scouts Canada. However, [[Canada Border Services Agency|Canada Customs]] denied them entry into the country. This prevented Phelps and his church members from appearing, and left supporters of the group to rally outside the offices without opposition.

The group folded in [[2001 in Canada|2001]] due to a lack of interest.

===National issues===
Scouts Canada conducted a [[Scouts Canada Property Review|property review]] in [[Ontario]] which concluded that dozens of camps should be sold. This has resulted in legal action between the [[Scouts Canada Ontario Incorporated Body]] and local Scouters. Action was underway in November [[2005]]<ref>http://www.stthomastimesjournal.com/story.php?id=199066</ref> and is ongoing.

==<font color=blue>Francophone Scouting in Ontario</font>==
==<font color=green>Girl Guiding in Ontario</font>==

[[Mary Malcolmson]] organized the first Canadian Girl Guide Company to be officially registered in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]]; their registration is dated January 1910. A park in St. Catharines was later named for Mary Malcolmson. Other Guide Companies were registered later in 1910, in [[Toronto]]. The First Toronto Company held the first-recorded Girl Guide Camp in Canada on the banks of the [[Credit River]] in June of [[1911]]. By [[1912]], the movement had spread to all parts of Canada, and had become so popular that on [[July 24]] [[1912]] [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] created Lady [[Mary Pellatt]] "[[Chief Commissioner]] of the Dominion of Canada Girl Guides". Many Guide events were held at her home, [[Casa Loma]], in [[Toronto]]. It is now a tourist attraction with a special Girl Guide display.

Guiding is now served by the '''Guiding in Canada - Ontario Council''', with 44,000 girl members, 11,000 adults, 13 Areas and 37 camps throughout Ontario.
