The term '''flag of convenience''' describes the business practice of [[Ship registration|registering]] a [[merchant ship]] in a [[sovereign state]] different from that of the ship's owners, and flying that state's [[civil ensign]] on the ship.  Ships are registered under flags of convenience to reduce operating costs or avoid the regulations of the owner's country.<!--cited below--><!-- <nowiki>which encourage safety and discourage the exploitation of [[mariner]]s.<ref name="kemp">Kemp, 1976.</ref></nowiki>-->  The closely-related term '''open registry''' is used to describe an organization that will register ships owned by foreign entities.

<!-- Background -->The term "flag of convenience" has been in use since the 1950s<!--cited below --> and refers to the civil ensign a ship flies to indicate its country of registration or [[flag state]].  A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case.<!--cited below-->

<!-- History -->The modern practice of flagging ships in foreign countries began in the 1920s in the [[United States]], when shipowners frustrated by increased regulations and rising labor costs began to register their ships to [[Panama]].  The use of flags of convenience steadily increased, and in 1968, [[Liberia]] grew to surpass the [[United Kingdom]] as the world's largest shipping register.  <!-- Extent of use -->{{as of|2009}}, more than half of the world<U+2019>s merchant ships are registered under flags of convenience, and the Panamanian, Liberian, and Marshallese flags of convenience account for almost 40% of the entire world fleet, in terms of [[deadweight tonnage]].<!--cited in main text -->

<!-- Criticism -->Flag-of-convenience registries are often criticized.  <!-- Ratification of maritime conventions -->{{as of|2009}}, thirteen flag states have been found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations.  A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions.  Ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime and terrorism, frequently offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  <!-- Port state targeting -->{{as of|2009}}, ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit.  <!--  Support -->Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.

==Background==
International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country.<ref name="icftu7">ICFTU et al., 2002, p. 7.</ref>  This country in which a ship is registered is called its [[flag state]],<ref>Bernaert, 2006, p. 104.</ref> and the flag state gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign.<ref name="unclos91">That the flag state gives the right to fly its flag, see United Nations, 1982, Article 91.  That this flag is called a civil ensign, see De Kleer, 2007, p. 37.</ref>  A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents.  A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case.<ref name="ham04">Hamzah, 2004, p.4.</ref>  The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry.  Registries may be governmental or private agencies.  In some cases, such as the United States' Alternative Compliance Program, the registry can assign a third party to administer inspections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/acp/ |title=U.S. Coast Guard Alternative Compliance Program |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>

The reasons for choosing an open register are varied and include [[tax avoidance]],<ref name="working99"/> the ability to avoid national labor and environmental regulations,<ref name="working99"/><ref name="dh1980">Dempsey and Helling, 1980.</ref> and the ability to hire crews from lower-wage countries.<ref name="working99">Working, 1999.</ref><ref>From the American Heritage dictionary definition available on-line at {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flag+of+convenience |title=Flag of convenience |first= |last= |author=Houghton Mifflin Company |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition |publisher=Farlex Inc. |location=Huntingdon Valley, PA |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2010-08-25 }} or {{cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/flag-of-convenience |title=Flag of convenience |first= |last= |author=Houghton Mifflin Company |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition |publisher=LoveToKnow Corp |location=Burlingame, CA |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2010-08-25  }}</ref>  National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens.  Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked.<ref name="richardson">Richardson, 2003.</ref><ref name="neff07">Neff, 2007.</ref>  The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs.  The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group|Sea-Land]]'s fleet of 63 ships were foreign flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.<ref name="working99"/>

In addition to shipboard living and working conditions, these inspections cover items concerning the safety of life at sea and the prevention of pollution by ships.<ref name="paris-about"/>  In cases when a port state inspection uncovers problems with a ship, the port state may take actions including [[Port state control#Detention of ship under Port State Control|detaining the ship]].<ref>Secretariat of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, 2009.</ref>  In 2008, member states of the Paris MOU conducted 14,322 inspections with deficiencies, which resulted in vessels being detained 1,220 times that year.<ref>Secretariat of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, 2009, p 27.</ref>  Member states of the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding conducted 13,298 ship inspections in 2009, recording 86,820 deficiencies which resulted in 1,336 detentions.<ref>Secretariat of the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding, 2009, p 22.</ref>

The principle that there be a "genuine link" between a ship's owners and its flag state dates back to 1958, when Article 5(1) of the [[Geneva Convention on the High Seas]] also required that "the state must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag."<ref name="dandrea2">D'Andrea 2006, p.2.</ref>  The principle was repeated in Article 91 of the 1982 treaty called the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and often referred to as UNCLOS.<ref name="icftu7"/>  In 1986, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] attempted to solidify the genuine link concept in the [[United Nations Convention for Registration of Ships]].<ref name="dandrea6">D'Andrea 2006, p.6.</ref>  The Convention for Registration of Ships would require that a flag state be linked to its ships either by having an economic stake in the ownership of its ships or by providing mariners to crew the ships.<ref name="dandrea6"/>  To come into force, the 1986 treaty requires 40 signatories whose combined tonnage exceeds 25% of the world total.<ref name="dandrea6"/>  {{as of|2006}}, only 14 countries have signed the treaty.<ref name="dandrea6"/>

==History==
Merchant ships have used [[false flag]]s as a tactic to evade enemy warships since antiquity, and examples can be found from as early as the [[Roman era]] through the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="wis113">Wiswall 1996, p. 113.</ref>  More recently, this technique was used by the British during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the United States during the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="kemp">Kemp, 1976.</ref>  However, the modern practice of registering ships in foreign countries to gain economic advantage originated in the United States in the era of [[World War I]], and the term flag of convenience came into use in the 1950s.<ref>Merriam-Webster Incorporated, 2003, p.474.</ref>

Roosevelt]]'s [[Secretary of State]] during World War II.<ref name="des74">DeSombre 2006, p. 74.</ref>  Stettinius created a corporate structure that included [[The Liberia Corporation]], a joint-venture with the government of Liberia.<ref name="des74"/>  The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation.<ref name="des74"/>  The Liberian registry was created at a time when the Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U. S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.<ref name="des74"/>

On 11 March 1949, Greek shipping magnate [[Stavros Niarchos]] registered the first ship under the Liberian flag of convenience, the ''World Peace''.  When Stettinius died in 1950, ownership of the registry passed to the [[International Bank of Washington]], led by General [[George Olmsted]].<ref name="gs">Pike, 2008.</ref>  Within 18 years, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world's largest register.<ref name="gs"/>

Due to Liberia's [[Liberia#1989 and 1999 civil wars|1989 and 1999 civil wars]], its registry eventually fell second to Panama's flag of convenience, but maritime funds continued to supply 70% of its total government revenue.<ref name="gs"/>  After the civil war of 1990, Liberia joined with the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]] to develop a new maritime and corporate program.<ref name="gs"/> The resulting company, [[International Registries]],  was formed as a parent company, and in 1993 was bought out by its management.<ref name="gs"/> After taking over the Liberian government, Americo-Liberian warlord [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] signed a new registry contract with the [[Liberian International Ship and Corporate Registry]], commonly known as LISCR.

{{as of|2009}}, Panama, Liberia and the Marshall Islands are the worlds three largest registries in terms of deadweight tonnage (DWT).<ref name="review"/>  These three organizations registered 11,636 ships of {{DWT|1,000}} and above, for a total of {{DWT|468,405,000}}: more than 39% of the world's shipbourne carrying capacity.<ref name="review"/>  Panama dominates the scene with over 8,065 ships accounting for almost 23% of the world's DWT.<ref name="review"/>  Of the three, the Marshall Islands (with 1,265 registered ships) had the greatest rate of DWT increase in 2009, increasing its tonnage by almost 15%.<ref name="review"/>

==Criticism==
[[File:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|thumb|The [[drilling rig]] ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' flew a [[Marshall Islands|Marshallese]] flag of convenience.<ref>{{ABS name|0139290|''Deepwater Horizon''|accessdate=2010-06-12 |year=2010 }}</ref>]]There are a number of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of convenience system.  One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced.  Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions.  As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.

===Concealed ownership===
Shipowners often establish shell corporations to be the legal owners of their ships.<ref name="danger20">Gianni 2008, p. 20.</ref>  To distinguish between the actual shipowner and the shell corporations, the terms ''beneficial owner'' or ''ultimate owner'' are often used.  Webster's defines a beneficial owner as "one who enjoys the benefit of a property of which another is the legal owner."<ref name="mw2">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/results.pl?co=dictionary.lp.findlaw.com&topic=b9/b937a76fa541981941f5f389cd3fba2e |title=Beneficial Owner |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |work=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law |publisher=Merriam-Webster's Inc. |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}</ref>  A ship's beneficial owner is legally and financially responsible for the ship and its activities.<ref name="oecd4">OECD 2003, p. 4.</ref>

The 2004 Report of the UN Secretary General<U+2019>s Consultative Group on Flag State Implementation reported that "It is very easy, and comparatively inexpensive, to establish a complex web of corporate entities to provide very effective cover to the identities of beneficial owners who do not want to be known."<ref name="danger19">Gianni 2008, p. 19.</ref>  According to a 2003 report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] report entitled "Ownership and Control of Ships", these corporate structures are often multi-layered, spread across numerous jurisdictions, and make the beneficial owner "almost impenetrable" to law enforcement officials and taxation.<ref name="danger20"/>  The report concludes that "regardless of the reasons why the cloak of anonymity is made available, if it is provided it will also assist those who may wish to remain hidden because they engage in illegal or criminal activities, including terrorists."<ref name="danger20"/>

The OECD report concludes that the use of [[bearer share]]s is "perhaps the single most important (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism" to protect the anonymity of a ship's beneficial owner.<ref name="oecd8">OECD 2003, p. 8.</ref>  Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation.<ref name="oecd8"/>  There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded.<ref name="oecd8"/> 

Two similar techniques to provide anonymity for a ship's beneficial owner are "nominee shareholders" and "nominee directors."  In some jurisdictions that require shareholder identities to be reported, a loophole is created where the beneficial owner may appoint a nominee to be the shareholder, and that nominee cannot legally be compelled to reveal the identity of the beneficial owner.<ref name="oecd8-9">OECD 2003, pp. 8<U+2013>9.</ref>  All corporations are required to have at least one director, however many jurisdictions allow this to be a nominee director.<ref name="oecd9">OECD 2009, p. 9.</ref>  A nominee director's name would appear on all corporate paperwork in place of the beneficial owners, and like nominee shareholders, few jurisdictions can compel a nominee director to divulge the identity of beneficial owners.<ref name="oecd9"/>  To further complicate matters, some jurisdictions allow a corporation to fulfill the duties of a nominee director.<ref name="oecd9"/>

}}Flag of convenience ships have long been linked to crime on the high seas.  For example, in 1982, Honduras shut down its open registry operations because it had enabled "illegal traffic of all kinds and had given Honduras a bad name."<ref name="reuters1982">Reuters, 1982.</ref>  

Ships registered by the Cambodia Shipping Corporation (CSC) were found smuggling drugs and cigarettes in Europe, breaking the Iraq oil embargo, and engaging in human trafficking and prostitution in Europe and Asia.<ref name="neff07"/>  In response to these activities, in 2000, Ahamd Yahya of the Cambodian Ministry of Public Works and Transport told industry publication ''Fairplay'' "We don't know or care who owns the ships or whether they're doing 'white' or 'black' business ... it is not our concern."<ref name="neff07"/>  Less than two years later, French forces seized the Cambodian-flagged, Greek-owned MV ''Winner'' for cocaine smuggling.<ref name="neff07"/>  Shortly after the seizure, Cambodian Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] closed the registry to foreign ships,<ref name="neff07"/> and Cambodia canceled its contract with CSC shortly thereafter.<ref name="brooke04">Brooke, 2004.</ref> 

The North Korean flag of convenience has also garnered significant scrutiny.  In 2003, the North Korean freighter ''Pong-su'' reflagged to Tuvulu in the middle of a voyage shortly before being seized by Australian authorities for smuggling heroin into that country.<ref name="neff07"/>  That year thirteen nations began monitoring vessels under the North Korean flag for "illicit cargos, like drugs, missiles or nuclear weapon fuel."<ref name="brooke04"/>  In 2006, ships owned by Egyptian and Syrian interests, flagged by North Korea, and based in the United States were discovered to be engaged in smuggling migrants in Europe.<ref name="neff07"/>

===Terrorism===
The OECD report states that the possibility of terrorists using ships is "obvious" and "potentially devastating" and goes on to list ways in which ships could be used.<ref name="oecd5">OECD 2003, p.5.</ref>  One clear use would be to move personnel, equipment, and weapons around the world.<ref name="oecd5"/>  Another would be to transport bombs, such as a "[[intermodal container|container]] set to explode near a city."<ref name="oecd5"/>  Also, ships could be used as a weapon in their own right, for example an oil tanker or [[liquefied natural gas carrier]] rigged as a floating bomb.<ref name="oecd5"/>  Finally, the OECD discussed the possibility of criminal and terrorist organizations using ships engaging in legal or illegal trade as a source of revenue to fund criminal activities.<ref name="oecd6">OECD 2003, pp. 6.</ref>

These critics of the flag of convenience system argue that many of the FOC flag states lack the resources or the will to properly monitor and control those vessels. The [[Environmental Justice Foundation]] (EJF) contends that [[illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing]] (IUU) vessels use flags of convenience to avoid fisheries regulations and controls. Flags of convenience help reduce the operating costs associated with illegal fishing methods, and help illegal operators avoid prosecution and hide beneficial ownership.<ref>Gianni & Simpson, 2005.</ref> As a result, flags of convenience perpetuate IUU fishing which has extensive environmental, social and economic impacts, particularly in developing countries.<ref>Environmental Justice Foundation, 2009.</ref> The EJF is campaigning to end the granting of flags of convenience to fishing vessels as an effective measure to combat IUU fishing.

International regulations for the maritime industry are promulgated by agencies of the [[United Nations]], particularly the [[International Maritime Organization]] and [[International Labour Organization]].  Flag states adopt these regulations for their ships by ratifying individual treaties.  One common criticism against flag of convenience countries is that they allow shipowners to avoid these regulations by not ratifying important treaties or by failing to enforce them.  

Maritime International Secretariat Services (MARISEC) issues a yearly report entitled the ''Flag State Performance Table'' in association with industry groups the [[Baltic and International Maritime Council]], the [[International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners]], the [[International Chamber of Shipping]], the [[International Shipping Federation]], and the [[International Association of Independent Tanker Owners]].<ref name="marisec1">MARISEC 2009, p.1.</ref>  The 2009 report identified the six "core" conventions representing a minimum level of maritime regulation, from the viewpoint of shipowners, as SOLAS, MARPOL, LL 66, STCW, ILO 147, and CLC/FUND92.<ref name="marisec1"/>  Five of these six core conventions are not ratified by several flag of convenience countries.

The SOLAS and LL 66 conventions focus on shipboard safety issues.  [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]] is an acronym for Safety of Life at Sea, or formally "International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 as amended, including the 1988 Protocol, the [[International Safety Management Code]] (ISM) and the [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code]] (ISPS)".  Originally ratified in response to the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], SOLAS sets regulations on [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, emergency equipment and safety procedures, including continuous radio watches.  It has been updated to include regulations on ship construction, fire protection systems, life-saving appliances, radio communications, safety of navigation, management for the safe operation of ships,  and other safety and security concerns.<ref name="solas">{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=257&doc_id=647 |title=International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea |publisher=International Maritime Organization |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>  {{as of|2009}}, the Bolivian, Honduran, Lebanese, and Sri Lankan flags of convenience have not ratified the SOLAS treaty.<ref name="marisec"/>  [[LL 66]] is an industry designation for the "International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, including the 1988 Protocol".<ref name="marisec"/>  This convention sets standards for minimum buoyancy, hull stress, and ship's fittings, as well as establishing navigational zones where extra precautions must be taken.<ref name="ll66">{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=254 |title=International Convention on Load Lines, 1966 |publisher=International Maritime Organization |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>  {{as of|2009}}, the Bahamanian, Bolivian, Georgian, Honduran, and Sri Lankan flags of convenience have not ratified the LL 66 treaty.<ref name="marisec"/>

[[Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1976|ILO147]] is shorthand for the "International Labour Organization Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards) Convention 1976, including the 1996 Protocol".  This convention sets safety and competency standards, regulates work hours, manning, conditions of employment as well as shipboard living arrangements.<ref name="ilo147">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C147 |title=Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1976 |publisher=International Labour Organization |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>  {{as of|2009}}, the Antigua/Barbudan, Bolivian, Cambodian, North Korean, Georgian, Honduran, Jamaican, Mongolian, Vincentian, and Sri Lankan flags of convenience have not ratified the ILO147 treaty.<ref name="marisec"/>

MARPOL, CLC, and FUND are treaties related to pollution.  [[MARPOL]] refers to the "International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978, including Annexes I <U+2013> VI".  This treaty regulates pollution by ships, including oil and air pollution, shipboard sewage and garbage.<ref name="marpol">{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=258&doc_id=678 |title=International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78) |publisher=International Maritime Organization |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>  {{as of|2009}}, the Bahamanian, Bolivian, Cambodian, North Korean, Georgian, Honduran, Lebanese, Maltese, and Sri Lankan flags of convenience have not ratified the MARPOL treaty.<ref name="marisec"/>  [[International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage|CLC]] and [[International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage|FUND92]] refer to the "International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992" and the "International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992".  These two related conventions provide mechanisms to ensure remuneration for victims of oil spills.<ref name="clc">{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/conventions/contents.asp?doc_id=660&topic_id=256#4 |title=International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC), 1969 |publisher=International Maritime Organization |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref><ref name="fund">{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?doc_id=661&topic_id=256 |title=International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (FUND), 1971 |publisher=International Maritime Organization |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref>    {{as of|2009}}, the Bolivian, North Korean, Honduran, Lebanese, and, Mongolian flags of convenience have not ratified the CLC and FUND treaties.<ref name="marisec"/>

|}In 1978, a number of European countries agreed in [[The Hague]] to audit labour conditions on board vessels ''vis-a-vis'' the rules of the [[International Labour Organization]]. To this end, in 1982 the "[[Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control]]" (Paris MOU) was established, setting port state control standards for what is now twenty-six European countries and Canada. 

Several other regional Memoranda Of Understanding have been established based on the Paris model, including the "[[Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control in the Asia-Pacific Region]]", typically referred to as the "Tokyo MOU", and organizations for the Black Sea, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and Latin America.<ref name="TokyoMOU">Tokyo MOU Secretariat, 2008.</ref>  The Tokyo and Paris organizations generate, based on deficiencies and detentions, black-, white-, and grey-lists of flag states.  The [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]], which handles port state control inspections in the US, maintains a similar target list for underperforming flag states.  {{as of|2009}}, fourteen of the thirty-one flags of convenience listed by the ITF are targeted for special enforcement by the countries of the Paris and Tokyo MOUs or U.S. Coast Guard: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Cayman Islands, North Korea, Georgia, Honduras, Lebanon, Malta, Mongolia, Lebanon, Malta, Mongolia, Panama, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.<ref name="marisec"/>

The seafaring industry is often broken down in two employment groups: licensed mariners including [[deck officer]]s and [[marine engineers]], and mariners that are not required to have licenses, such as [[able seamen]] and [[chief cook|cooks]].  The latter group is collectively known as [[unlicensed mariner]]s or ratings.  Differences in wages can be seen in both groups, between "high cost" crewing sources such as the United States, and "low cost" sources such as China and The Philippines.  

For unlicensed mariners, 2009 statistics from the American [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] give median earnings for [[able seaman|able]] and [[ordinary seaman|ordinary seamen]] as US$35,810, varying from $21,640 (at the 10th percentile) to $55,360 (at the 90th percentile).<ref name="bls-seaman">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/2009/may/oes535011.htm |title=Sailors and Marine Oilers |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref>  This can be compared with 2006 statistics from the International Labour Organization, giving average yearly earnings for Filipino and Chinese able seamen around $2,000 to $3,000 per year ([[Philippine peso|PHP]]9,900 per month and [[Chinese yuan|CNY]]3,071 per year).<ref name="laborsta-china">From {{cite web |url=http://laborsta.ilo.org/ |title=LABORSTA |author=Department of Statistics |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year=2006 |work= |publisher=International Labour Office |location=Geneva |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2010-07-01 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}.
