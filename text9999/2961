'''Tiridates I''' ({{Lang-hy| <U+054F><U+0580><U+0564><U+0561><U+057F> <U+0531>}}, [[Eastern Armenian|EA]]: Trdat I, [[Western Armenian|WA]]: Drtad I) was king of [[Armenia]] beginning in 53 AD and the founder of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia|Arshakuni Dynasty]], the Armenian line of the [[Arsacid Dynasty]].  His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63.  In an agreement to resolve the [[Roman relations with the Parthians and Sassanians#Relations during the Julio-Claudian dynasty|Roman-Parthian conflict]] in and over Armenia, Tiridates (who was the brother of [[Vologases I of Parthia]]) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor [[Nero]] in 66 AD; in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans.  Even though this made Armenia a [[Satellite state|client kingdom]], various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had [[de facto]] ceded Armenia to [[Parthia]].<ref name="Redgate"> {{cite book | last = Redgate | first = Anne Elizabeth| title = The Armenians | edition = First | year = 2000 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers Inc.  | location = Massachusetts | pages = p.88<U+2013>91 |id = ISBN 0-631-22037-2}}</ref>

In addition to being a king, Tiridates was also a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priest and was accompanied by other magi with him on his journey to Rome in 66 AD.  This is about the same time that the [[Gospel of Matthew]] recorded a journey of wise men from the east to the infant [[Jesus]] in [[Bethlehem]]. This may lay behind the later Christian legend of the [[Three Magi]].<ref name="Redgate"> {{cite book | last = Redgate | first = Anne Elizabeth| title = The Armenians | edition = First | year = 2000 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers Inc. | location = Massachusetts | pages = p.88<U+2013>91 |id = ISBN 0-631-22037-2}}</ref> In the early 20th century, [[Franz Cumont]] speculated that Tiridates was instrumental in the development of [[Mithraism]],<ref>LES RELIGIONS ORIENTALES DANS LE PAGANISME ROMAINE (Conf<U+00E9>rences faites au Coll<U+00E9>ge de France en 1905) by [[Franz Cumont]]</ref> which<U+2014>in Cumont's view<U+2014>was simply Romanized Zoroastrianism. This "continuity" theory has since been collectively refuted.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Beck|first=Roger|title=Mithraism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|year=2002|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/sup/Mithraism.html}}</ref>

The dates of his birth and death are unknown.  

==Ascension==
Tiridates was the son of [[Vonones II of Parthia]] and a [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[concubine]].<ref>Assuming that the mother of Vologases, Pacorus and Tiridates was the same woman. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075687/Vologeses-I Britannica]</ref> Virtually nothing is known about his minority and youth, which he spent in Media, where his father was governor under the reign of his brother [[Gotarzes II]].

Vologases considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of [[spahbod]] Moneses a well-disciplined force of [[cataphracts]] along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia.<ref name="Lindsay">{{cite book |first = John | last = Lindsay | title = A View of the History and Coinage of the Parthians |publisher = Adamant Media Corporation  | pages = p. 83<U+2013>84 | id = ISBN 1402160801 }}</ref> Corbulo having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of Verulanus Severus and Vettius Bolanus to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatches a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the [[Euphrates]] and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them.<ref name="Lindsay">{{cite book |first = John | last = Lindsay | title = A View of the History and Coinage of the Parthians |publisher = Adamant Media Corporation  | pages = p. 83<U+2013>84 | id = ISBN 1402160801 }}</ref> Moneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation. He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases in Nisibis located {{convert|37|mi|km}} from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace.<ref name="Lindsay">{{cite book |first = John | last = Lindsay | title = A View of the History and Coinage of the Parthians |publisher = Adamant Media Corporation  | pages = p. 83<U+2013>84 | id = ISBN 1402160801 }}</ref> Vologases demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates be recognized.

The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into [[Melitene]] and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Penny Cyclop<U+00E6>dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge  |publisher = Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge  | pages = p. 496| year = 1842 |location = Great Britain}}</ref> Tiridates was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed.

==Visiting Rome==
Prior to embarking for Rome, Tiridates visited his mother and two brothers in [[Media Atropatene]] and Parthia. On his long trek he was accompanied by his family and an imposing retinue, comprised of many feudal lords and 3,000 horsemen. His route lay across [[Thrace]], through [[Illyria]], on the eastern shores of the [[Adriatic]] and [[Picenum]], in northeastern [[Italy]]. The journey took nine months, and Tiridates rode on horseback, with his children and queen at his side.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]], 63.1.2</ref> The children of Vologases, Monobazes and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates.<ref name="Dio1">{{cite book |first = Dio | last = Cassius | title = Dio's Rome Vol. 5 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 34 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1-4191-1613-4 }}</ref> 

[[Dio Cassius]], a second-century Roman historian, described Tiridates favorably at the time of his arrival: "Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life, a notable figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence."<ref name="Dio1">{{cite book |first = Dio | last = Cassius | title = Dio's Rome Vol. 5 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 34 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1-4191-1613-4 }}</ref> Nero greeted Tiridates at Neapolis ([[Naples]]) in October, sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles. No one was allowed to approach the emperor armed, but Tiridates maintained his dignity by refusing to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire (though as a compromise, he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath, so that it could not be drawn). At Puteolis (modern [[Pozzuoli]], near Naples) Nero ordered athletic games to be staged in honor of his guest. The Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes. The event at Puteolis also marked the first attested appearance of [[female gladiator]]s:

{{cquote|''Nero admired him for this action [(Tiridates' refusal to remove his sword)] and entertained him in many ways, especially by giving a gladiatorial exhibition at Puteoli. It was under the direction of Patrobius, one of his freedmen, who managed to make it a most brilliant and costly affair, as may be seen from the fact that on one of the days not a person but Ethiopians<U+2014>men, women, and children<U+2014>appeared in the theatre.''<ref>Dio Cassius, 62.3.1</ref>}}

The climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital. Rome was profusely decorated with flags, torches, garlands and bunting, and was gorgeously illuminated at night with great crowds of people seen everywhere.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite book |first = Naphtali | last = Lewis | title = Roman Civilization: Selected Readings : The Empire | publisher = Columbia University Press  | pages = p. 33 | year = 1990 | id = ISBN 0231071337 }}</ref> 
[[Image:Trdatrome.gif|thumb|150px|Marble statue of Tiridates erected in Rome in honor of his visit. [[Louvre Museum]].]]
On the day after Tiridates' arrival, Nero came to the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers, all resplendent in expensive attire and glittering armor. While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the [[dais]], Tiridates knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates addressed the emperor: 

{{cquote|My Lord, I am a descendant of [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsakes]] and the brother of the Kings [Vologases] and Pacorus. I have come to you who are my god; I have worshipped you as the [sun];<ref>
<div class="small">[[Edward Champlin]] notes: "When Nero entered with the senators and the guard, he ascended the Rostra and sat in his chair of state, looking back down the Forum in an east-southeasterly direction. That is, as Tiridates approached him through the ranks of soldiers, the rising sun would have hit Nero full on the face, in all his triumphal splendor. The prince then addressed the emperor from the ground, looking up to him on the Rostra: "I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do Mithra." The important point<U+2014>something Nero would know as an initiate, whether others did or not<U+2014>is that for Zoroastrians the sun was the eye of Mithra, and Mithra was often so closely associated with the sun as to be identified with it: "the Sun whom they call Mithres," as Strabo puts it. Moreover, when Zoroastrians prayed in the open air, they turned toward the sun, since their religion bound them to pray facing fire. Thus, when Tiridates stood in the open Roman Forum facing the sunlit emperor, and worshipping him as he did Mithra, he was in essence worshipping the sun. An ex-praetor translated his words and proclaimed them to the crowd. At this stage in Rome's history, very few of those present would have known who Mithra was, but there is a good likelihood that the interpreter relayed Tiridates' words as "I have come to you, my god, worshipping you as I do the Sun." For Nero, the marriage of Roman triumph and Parthian ceremony culminated in a splendid theatrical affirmation of his role as the new god of the Sun."</div>

To which Nero replied: 

{{cquote|You have done well by coming here to enjoy my presence in person. What your father has not left to you and what your brothers did not preserve for you, I do accord to you, and I make you King of Armenia, so that you, as well as they, may know that I have the power to take away and to grant kingdoms.<ref>Dio Cassius, 63.5.2</ref>}}

Tiridates then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt, while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head. As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers. A [[Praetor]], speaking to the audience, interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates, who spoke in Greek.<ref>{{cite book |first = Gaius | last = Suetonius Tranquillus |coauthors =Robert Graves, Michael Grant| title = The Twelve Caesars | publisher = Penguin Classics  | pages = p. 220 | year = 2003 | id = ISBN 0140449213 }}</ref> According to [[Pliny the Elder]], Tiridates then introduced Nero to magian feasts (''magicis cenis'').<ref>Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 30.6.17</ref> [[Tacitus]] claimed that Tiridates was also interested in all things Roman.

Public festivities continued for some time after the coronation ceremony. The interior of the [[Theatre of Pompey]] and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as "the Golden Day." Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver's headdress, took part in a [[chariot race]]. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with [[zither]] accompaniment. Tiridates was amazed and disgusted by Nero's extravagance, but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his surprise at his serving such a master.<ref name="Dio">{{cite book |first = Dio | last = Cassius | title = Dio's Rome Vol. 5 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 36 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1-4191-1613-4 }}</ref>  He made no concealment of his views to Nero's face and said to him sarcastically: "Sire, you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo."<ref name="Dio">{{cite book |first = Dio | last = Cassius | title = Dio's Rome Vol. 5 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 36 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1-4191-1613-4 }}</ref> 

In memory of these events, the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of [[Imperator]], or commander-in-chief of the armies. No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome. Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities, the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates and his retinue, both from and to their homeland. Nero also made a gift to Tiridates of fifty million [[sesterces]].<ref>{{cite book

On his journey back to Armenia, Tiridates viewed an exhibition of [[pancratium]].

Later, Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: "It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other."<ref name="Dio">{{cite book |first = Dio | last = Cassius | title = Dio's Rome Vol. 5 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | pages = p. 36 | year = 2004 | id = ISBN 1-4191-1613-4 }}</ref>

==Fragile peace==
[[Image:Trdatgreek.gif|thumb|150px|Greek inscription attributed to Tiridates I on basalt rock from Garni.]]Peace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire.

==War with Alans and aftermath==
In 72 the [[Alans]], a warlike nomadic [[Sarmatian]] tribe, made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia. Tiridates and his brother [[Pacorus II of Parthia|Pacorus]], King of Media Atropatene, faced them at a number of battles, during one of which Tiridates was briefly captured, narrowly escaping being taken alive. He was lassoed from a distance and caught, but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time. The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Jewish Wars]]'' 7.8.4</ref> The king of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from [[Vespasian]], who helped reconstruct the fortress of [[Harmozica]] around the Iberian capital [[Mtskheta]], near modern [[Tbilisi]]. An [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates also warred with Iberia during his final years. The exact date of the end of Tiridates' reign is unknown; various sources name Sanatruces as his successor.<ref>Both Classical Greco-Roman and Armenian sources from the [[Late Antiquity]] mention Sanatruces (Sanatruk in Armenian), in Armenian sources he is identified with the martyrdom of [[Saint Jude|Thaddeus]]. Professor Nina Garsoian, Emerita of Columbia University, states that there is no explicit evidence naming Sanatruces as Tiridates' successor. {{cite book
