A '''Bacon Explosion''' is a [[pork]] dish that consists of [[bacon]] wrapped around a filling of spiced [[sausage]] and crumbled bacon. The American-[[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|football]]-sized dish is [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]] or [[baking|baked]]. It caused an Internet sensation after being posted on the BBQ Addicts blog,<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=Telegraph/> and quickly spread to the mainstream press with numerous stories discussing the dish.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/dining/28bacon.html |title=Take Bacon.

Blog |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Damon |last=Darlin |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090130125138/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/dining/28bacon.html |archivedate=30 January 2009 |deadurl=no}}</ref>  In time, the articles began to discuss the Internet "buzz" itself.<ref name=NYTimes/> The phenomenon is international, with popularity in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Bacon Explosion is made of bacon, sausage, barbeque sauce and barbeque seasoning or rub. The bacon is assembled in a weave to hold the sausage, sauce and crumbled bacon. Once rolled, the Bacon Explosion is cooked, basted, cut and served. The Bacon Explosion's creators produced a cookbook featuring the recipes which ultimately won the 2010 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards for "Best Barbecue Book in the World". The Bacon Explosion also won at the 2013 Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival.

==History and origin==
Jason Day and Aaron Chronister posted the dish in December 2008 on their "BBQ Addicts" blog.<ref name="bbqaddicts">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbqaddicts.com/blog/recipes/bacon-explosion/ |title=Bacon Explosion: The BBQ Sausage Recipe of all Recipes |work=BBQ Addicts |first=Jason |last=Day |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate=28 January 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090201015007/http://www.bbqaddicts.com/blog/recipes/bacon-explosion/ |archivedate=1 February 2009 |deadurl=no}}</ref> It quickly became an [[Internet phenomenon]], generating more than 500,000 hits and 16,000 links to the blog, and was even included on political blogs because "[[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] like meat."<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/4399224/Bacon-Explosion-recipe-is-most-popular-on-the-web.html |title=Bacon Explosion recipe is most popular on the web |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Anita |last=Singh |date=30 January 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090131160112/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/4399224/Bacon-Explosion-recipe-is-most-popular-on-the-web.html |archivedate=31 January 2009 |deadurl=no}}</ref> There are fan clubs and follow-up videos of various attempts to create the dish.<ref name=Telegraph/>

The inventors are experienced barbecue competition participants from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and compete in cook-offs as the Burnt Finger BBQ team.<ref name=Telegraph/> According to the ''Telegraph'', "They came up with the delicacy after being challenged on [[Twitter]] to create the ultimate bacon recipe."<ref name=Telegraph/> They christened their innovation the "Bacon Explosion: The BBQ Sausage Recipe of all Recipes."<ref name=Telegraph/> The Bacon Explosion is similar to a number of previously published recipes. Day and Chronister do not claim to have invented the concept,<ref name=NYTimes/> but assert the term "Bacon Explosion" as a trademark.<ref name="bbqaddicts"/>

==Preparation==
Preparing a Bacon Explosion "requires the minimum of culinary talent" and the ingredient list is short.<ref name=Telegraph/> It is made from {{convert|2|lb|g}} of thick cut bacon, 2&nbsp;pounds of [[Italian sausage]], one jar of [[barbecue sauce]], and one jar of barbecue rub/seasoning.<ref name=Telegraph/> The Bacon Explosion is constructed by weaving the bacon together to serve as a base. The base is seasoned and followed by the layering of sausage meat and crumbled bacon. Barbecue sauce is added and more seasoning is added, before rolling it into a giant "sausage-shaped monster."<ref name=Telegraph/> It takes about an hour per inch of thickness to cook and is then basted with more barbecue sauce, sliced into rounds, and served.<ref name=Telegraph/> A prepared Bacon Explosion contains at least {{convert|5000|cal|J|lk=on}} and 500&nbsp;grams of fat,<ref name=NYTimes/> though a smaller 8-ounce portion contains 878&nbsp;calories and 60&nbsp;grams of fat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.headsupeating.com/nutrition-facts/+Bacon+Explosion/18385/ |title=Bacon Explosion by Weight |work=Stay Cut |first=Greg |last=Taylor |date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>
