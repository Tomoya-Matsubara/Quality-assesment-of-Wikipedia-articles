He was part of the West Ham side elected to the [[Football League]] in 1919 and became a regular in their league side. Tresadern made his [[England national football team|England]] debut in April 1923, in the 2-2 [[British Home Championship|Home International]] draw with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. His only other appearance for England came the following month against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in [[Stockholm]]. The same year, he was part of the West Ham side that lost to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the first ever [[FA Cup]] [[FA Cup Final 1923|final]] to be held at [[Wembley stadium|Wembley]].
