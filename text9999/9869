'''Kenneth Vincent John Wheeler''' (born 14th January 1930, Toronto, Canada)  is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[composer]] and [[trumpet]] and [[flugelhorn]] player, based in the U.K. since the 1950s. 

Most of his output is rooted in [[jazz]], but he has also been active in [[free improvisation]] and has occasionally contributed to [[rock music]] recordings. Highly respected among his peers for his beautiful tone and extensive range on the trumpet and flugelhorn, Wheeler has written over one hundred compositions and is a skilled arranger for small groups and larger ensembles. His compositions blend lyrical melodies with a distinctive and ever changing harmonic palette.  

He has recorded some twenty albums as a leader, and has recorded or performed with [[Dave Holland]], [[John Taylor (jazz)|John Taylor]] and [[Norma Winstone]] (as [[Azimuth]]), [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Lee Konitz]], [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Theo J<U+00F6>rgensmann Quartet]], [[David Sylvian]], [[Steve Coleman]], [[Spiritualized]] and the [[Spontaneous Music Ensemble]], among others.

==Biography==
Growing up in Toronto, Wheeler began playing cornet at age 12, and became interested in jazz in his mid-teens. Wheeler spent a year studying composition at the [[Royal Conservatory of Music (Toronto)|Royal Conservatory in Toronto]] in 1950. In 1952, Wheeler moved to Britain. He found his way into the London jazz scene of the time, playing in groups led by [[Tommy Whittle]], [[Tubby Hayes]] and [[Ronnie Scott]]. Throughout the Sixties, he worked with [[John Dankworth]], and also formed part of ([[Eric Burdon]] and) [[The Animals]] Big Band that made its one-and-only public appearance at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival|5th Annual British Jazz & Blues Festival]] in Richmond (1965) with tenors [[Stan Robinson (jazz musician) |Stan Robinson]], [[Dick Morrissey]] and [[Al Gay]], baritone sax [[Paul Carroll]], and fellow trumpets [[Ian Carr]] and Greg Brown. 
In 1968, Wheeler appeared on guitarist [[Terry Smith (British jazz guitarist)|Terry Smith]]'s first solo album, ''Fall Out''. Kenny Wheeler still lives in Britain today. 

===Writing for large ensembles===
Kenny Wheeler has performed and recorded his own compositions with large jazz ensembles throughout his career, starting with his first album ''Windmill Tilter'', (1969), recorded with the [[John Dankworth]] band.  The ''Windmill Tilter'' LP today is a collector's item, since the original master tapes have been lost, though there are plans to remaster it from vinyl and reissue it on CD in 2007 on John Dankworth's Qnote label.  The [[big band]] album ''Song for Someone'', (1973, Incus10) fused Wheeler's characteristic orchestral writing with passages of free improvisation provided by musicians such as [[Evan Parker]] and [[Derek Bailey]], and was also named Album of the Year by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine in 1975. This has subsequently been reissued on CD by Evan Parker's Psi label (psi 04.01)

===Improvised music===
In the mid-1960s, Wheeler became a close participant in the nascent [[free improvisation]] movement in London, playing with [[John Stevens (drummer)|John Stevens]], [[Evan Parker]], the [[Spontaneous Music Ensemble]] and the [[Globe Unity Orchestra]].  His involvement in this genre continues to this day.  

===Small group jazz===
Despite the above-noted accomplishments, much of Wheeler's reputation rests on his work with smaller jazz groups. Wheeler's first small group recordings to gain significant critical attention were ''Gnu High'' (1975) and ''Deer Wan'' (1977), both for the ECM label. 

Wheeler was the trumpet player in the [[Anthony Braxton]] Quartet from 1971 to 1976; and from 1977 he was also a member of chamber jazz group [[Azimuth (group)|Azimuth]] (with [[John Taylor (jazz)|John Taylor]] and [[Norma Winstone]]).

More recently, Wheeler received widespread critical praise for his 1997 album ''Angel Song'', which featured an unusual "drummerless" quartet of [[Bill Frisell]] (guitar), [[Dave Holland]] (bass) and [[Lee Konitz]] (alto sax).

===Critical reaction===

''"The Wheeler sound is one of the most distinctive in the history of the jazz trumpet. A thin, overblown note is followed by a florid flurry, the high squeal by a long low note he rolls around his mouth like a chewy mint. Although his phrases are bordered, like blotting paper in ink, with romanticism, the comforting phrase is superseded by the querulous, a moment of tenderness by a scream of panic. He has his trademark tics, but is incapable of producing a hackneyed phrase. Like words from a prophet, every note counts."''

- Sholto Byrnes in ''[[The Independent]]'', 20th August 2002 (quoted on guitarist [[John Parriccelli]]'s website [http://members.aol.com/parricelli/parricelli4.htm]
