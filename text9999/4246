'''Adrian Mihai Cioroianu''' (born [[January 5]], [[1967]]) is a [[Romania]]n historian, politician, journalist, and essayist. A lecturer for the History Department at the [[University of Bucharest]], he is the author of several books dealing with [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] (and specifically with the history of [[Communist Romania]]). He is also noted for his contribution as co-author of a high school textbook.

A member of the [[Group for Social Dialogue]], he joined the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and was elected to the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]] for [[Timi<U+015F> County]] in 2004. Following the [[accession of Romania to the European Union]] ([[January 1]], [[2007]]), he served as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] in the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) and a vice president of the ALDE group in the [[European Parliament]]. On [[April 5]], [[2007]], Cioroianu became [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Affairs Minister]] in the second [[C<U+0103>lin Popescu T<U+0103>riceanu]] cabinet. On [[April 11]] [[2008]] he announced his resignation, following a scandal involving the death of a Romanian citizen on hunger strike in Poland.

A contributor to numerous newspapers and magazines (including ''[[Cotidianul]]'', ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', ''Lettre International'', and ''Dosarele Istoriei''), he has been a member of the editorial staff for ''[[Dilema Veche]]'' since 1998, and an editor for ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]'' since 2003. Between 2000 and 2004, Cioroianu has hosted several [[talk show]]s on television (for [[Senso TV|Pax TV]], [[TVR 1]], and [[Realitatea TV]]).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in [[Craiova]] to Iulian and Valeria, Cioroianu graduated from the University of Bucharest's Faculty of History in 1993, taking a [[Master's degree]] from [[Universit<U+00E9> Laval]] in [[Quebec]] (1997), and a [[PhD]] from the same institution (with the thesis ''The Myth, the Images and the Cult of the Leader in Communist Romania'', 2002). 

In 1993 he married Lumini<U+0163>a, a university classmate who became an English-language translator.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.infonews.ro/article61218.html Florin Ghioca, "Divor<U+0163>at de so<U+0163>ie <U+015F>i 'cuplat' de pres<U+0103> cu Andreea Marin" ("Divorced by His Wife and 'Coupled' by the Press with Andreea Marin")], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', February 20, 2007</ref> They had a son, Mihai, in 1999 before divorcing in November 2003. His wife cited an extramarital affair and a disinterest in family obligations as motives for the divorce.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://news.zp.ro/module-Pagesetter-printpub-tid-3-pid-12582.phtml Eduard Neagu, "Acuzat c<U+0103> <U+015F>i-a p<U+0103>r<U+0103>sit copilul pentru amant<U+0103>" ("Accused of Abandoning His Child for a Lover")], in ''[[Libertatea]]'', December 1, 2007</ref>

===Textbook controversy===
One of his first noted public appearances took place in 1999, when several textbooks received endorsement from the [[Ministry of Education and Research of Romania|Ministry of Education]], as multiple alternatives to the older ones (which had been authored by the Ministry itself). New methods and subjects proposed in the study of Romanian history became the center of controversy, which involved, among others, the textbook authored by Cioroianu and other University staff ([[Stelian Brezeanu]], Florin M<U+00FC>ller, Mihai Sorin R<U+0103>dulescu, and [[Mihai Retegan]]) for [[Editura RAO]]; the book itself was criticized for not allocating a larger segment to the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], and Cioroianu later explained that the editorial choice had been imposed by the level of trustworthy sources available at the time.<ref name="Tutuianu">[http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_42973/revolutia_alternativa.html Radu Tutuianu, "Revolu<U+0163>ia alternativ<U+0103>" ("The Aternative Revolution")], in ''[[Jurnalul Na<U+0163>ional]]'', December 27, 2005</ref> 

Cioroianu was also highly critical of the methods used by adversaries of the textbooks during the overall debate, and publicly sided with the authors of arguably the most innovative manual, the one published by [[Editura Sigma]].<ref name="Cernat">{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=2003&print=true Paul Cernat, "Cioroianu trece ecranul" ("Cioroianu Moves beyond the Screen")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]''</ref><ref name="P<U+00E2>r<U+00E2>ianu">{{ro icon}} [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2005-12-01-paraianu-ro.html R<U+0103>zvan P<U+00E2>r<U+00E2>ianu, "Politica <U+015F>i predarea istoriei" ("Politics and the Teaching of History"), in ''Eurozine'']</ref> He repeatedly argued in favor of the authors ([[Sorin Mitu]], [[Ovidiu Pecican]], Lucia Copoeru, Virgiliu <U+0162><U+00E2>r<U+0103>u, and Liviu <U+0162><U+00EE>r<U+0103>u), debating the issue with [[Marius Tuc<U+0103>]] and [[Octavian Paler]] during television appearances of that year.<ref name="Cernat"/>

Throughout the [[Adrian N<U+0103>stase]] [[Prime Minister of Romania|premiership]] (2000-2004), Cioroianu remained critical of the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]]'s policies on education, and questioned the decision taken by the Minister of Education, [[Ecaterina Andronescu]], regarding restrictions on the number of textbooks receiving official approval.<ref name="Manuale22">{{ro icon}} [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2002-05-27&art=105 "Manualele alternative la cheremul MEC" ("Alternative Textbooks Left to the Whims of the Education Ministry")], in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', May 2002</ref>

===Political career===
[[Image:Cioroianu-and-rice-washington-20070613.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Adrian Cioroianu meets [[Condoleezza Rice]] in [[Washington, DC]], [[June 13]], [[2007]]]]

Cioroianu entered politics as a PNL member in 2002, when he became an adviser on [[Theodor Stolojan]]'s staff. 

In 2004, he was elected to the Senate for [[Timi<U+015F> County]], a member of the [[Justice and Truth]] group inside the [[Parliament of Romania]]. He was Vice President of the Senate Committee on Culture, Arts and Media, and stood on the Committee of Inquiry into the activities of the [[Romanian Television Company]]. 

With fellow National Liberal parliamentarians [[Mona Musc<U+0103>]], [[Viorel Oancea]], and [[Mih<U+0103>i<U+0163><U+0103> Calimente]], Cioroianu initiated the legislative project on [[lustration]] (aimed at preventing former [[Romanian Communist Party]] and [[Union of Communist Youth]] active cadres from holding public office over a period of ten years).<ref name="gheopat">[http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=45&art=10351&cHash=8dc298478a Lucian Gheorghiu, Cristian P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>coniu, "Rom<U+00E2>nia refuz<U+0103> s<U+0103> i<U+015F>i vad<U+0103> chipul in oglinda lustra<U+0163>iei" ("Romanian Refuses to Gaze upon Its Image in the Mirror of Lustration")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', March 13, 2006</ref><ref name="hotnews">{{ro icon}} [http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_46347-Legea-lustratiei-a-trecut-de-Senat.htm "Legea lustra<U+0163>iei a trecut de Senat" ("The Lustration Law Was Passed by the Senate"), April 10, 2006, at HotNews.ro]</ref> Proposed at the same time as a more radical one drafted by [[National Initiative Party]] politicians,<ref name="gheopat"/> it reflected the legacy of the ''[[Proclamation of Timi<U+015F>oara|Timi<U+015F>oara Proclamation]]''<ref name="gheopat"/> and was passed by the Senate in April 2006.<ref name="hotnews"/>

He became an observer to the [[European Parliament]] in 2005, and was subsequently selected MEP in 2007. On [[February 19]], [[2007]], he was nominated as foreign minister by [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[C<U+0103>lin Popescu T<U+0103>riceanu]], following the resignation of [[Mihai R<U+0103>zvan Ungureanu]].<ref name="ap12007">[[Associated Press]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/19/europe/EU-POL-Romania-Foreign-Minister.php "Romanian Prime Minister Proposes Cioroianu as New Foreign Minister"], in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' European edition, [[February 19]], [[2007]]</ref> [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian B<U+0103>sescu]] refused to approve the nomination, saying that Cioroianu lacked the necessary experience.<ref name="ap22007">[[Associated Press]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/13/europe/EU-POL-Romania-Foreign-Minister.php "Romanian Prime Minister Asks Court to Order President to Appoint New Foreign Minister"], in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' European edition, [[March 13]], [[2007]]</ref> In March, T<U+0103>riceanu asked the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]] to resolve the dispute.<ref name="ap22007"/>

Following the creation of the second Popescu T<U+0103>riceanu cabinet, Cioroianu was confirmed as foreign minister by President B<U+0103>sescu and sworn in on [[April 5]], [[2007]]. He resigned on [[April 11]], [[2008]] following a scandal involving an alleged Romanian thief who died following a [[hunger strike]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], [[Poland]], where he had been arrested. Romania's consular services were faulted for not intervening in his defense.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.ziua.net/news.php?data=2008-04-12&id=5583 "Ministrul de Externe Adrian Ciorioianu <U+015F>i-a dat demisia" ("Minister of Foreign Affairs Adrian Cioroianu Has Resigned")], in ''[[Ziua]]'', April 11, 2008</ref>

==="Greatest Romanians" controversy===
In autumn 2006, he was selected by [[TVR 1]] to take part in the [[100 greatest Romanians|televised poll to determine the greatest Romanian]], during which he was to showcase the career of ''[[Conduc<U+0103>tor]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]], Romania's [[World War II]] dictator; the public had already selected Antonescu as one of the top 10 entries. Like other [[intellectual]]s chosen to take part in the campaign, each supporting a particular entry, Cioroianu narrated a short documentary film, and was subsequently involved in debates on the TVR 1 set (during two separate rounds of voting). 

Unlike all other participants, he chose to base his account of Antonescu on criticism, exposing, among others, [[war crimes]] against the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] and [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] communities during the [[Holocaust]] (in [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] and elsewhere),<ref name="g<U+00E2>rne<U+0163>">{{ro icon}} [http://www.contrafort.md/2006/144/1096.html Vasile G<U+00E2>rne<U+0163>, "<U+00AB>Mari Rom<U+00E2>ni<U+00BB>. Concursul s-a terminat, discu<U+0163>iile continu<U+0103>" ("<U+00AB>Greatest Romanians<U+00BB>. The Competition Is Over, Debates Carry On"), in ''Contrafort'', October 2006]</ref> as well as Antonescu's unquestioned support for [[Adolf Hitler]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), while arguing that  Antonescu was a mediocre politician.<ref name="g<U+00E2>ndul">[http://www.gandul.info/articol_18884/programul__quot_mari_romani_quot___acuzat_de_denigrarea_maresalului_antonescu__.html "Programul <U+00AB>Mari Rom<U+00E2>ni<U+00BB>, acuzat de denigrarea mare<U+015F>alului Antonescu" ("The <U+00AB>Greatest Romanians<U+00BB> Program, Accessed of Denigrating Marshal Antonescu")], in ''[[G<U+00E2>ndul]]'', [[October 31]], [[2006]]</ref> 

The [[Romanian Academy]]'s National Institute for the Study of [[Totalitarianism]] reacted to the program, accusing TVR 1 of mounting an overt campaign to denigrate Antonescu.<ref name="g<U+00E2>ndul"/> It also questioned the fact that Cioroianu, a member of the Senate Committee on Culture, had accepted payment with public funds for his presence on the show.<ref name="g<U+00E2>ndul"/> Criticism was also voiced by ''[[Ziua]]'' newspaper, which asked why the Television had not handed the office to a public person with more positive views of the former Romanian leader, and argued that Cioroianu had used his position to shame those who had voted for Antonescu.<ref name="mmunteanu">{{ro icon}} [http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-10-24&id=209648&ziua=2ffb7a923d4bffa1054aabed030bb481 Miruna Munteanu, "Antonescu executat din nou, la TVR" ("Antonescu Executed a Second Time, on TVR")], in ''[[Ziua]]'', October 24, 2006</ref> 

In response, Cioroianu indicated that he had been invited on set as a history professor, not as an Antonescu defender or a Senator,<ref name="g<U+00E2>rne<U+0163>"/> and argued that his was a version determined by research (arguing that the latter is "the best cure against all sorts of mythologies and clich<U+00E9>s").<ref name="g<U+00E2>rne<U+0163>"/>
