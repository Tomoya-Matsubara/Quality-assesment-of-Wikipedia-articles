"'''Kill The Alligator and Run'''" is the nineteenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on April 30, 2000. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] has a nervous breakdown when it is revealed on a quiz that he only has three years left to live. To calm him down, the family goes to Florida for vacation. There, they end up in the middle of a raucous [[spring break]], where Homer joins in on the party and ends up getting himself and his family in trouble for killing the county's beloved mascot: an alligator named Captain Jack. [[Diedrich Bader]], [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]], [[Charlie Rose]], [[Joe C.]], and [[Kid Rock]] guest starred in the episode. 

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] gets a magazine loaded with [[personality test]]s and quizzes his friends and family with them. Later on, he takes his own test and reveals that he will only live until 42, which is only three years away. [[Necrophobia#Thanatophobia|Terrified]] of his supposedly impending death, he develops [[insomnia]] and goes [[insane]]. Homer visits the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|power plant]]'s [[psychiatrist]], who suggests that he go on a long vacation. The Simpsons go on a trip to [[Florida]], which Homer calls "America's [[Penis|Wang]]". When the family arrives there, they find themselves in the middle of a raucous [[spring break]]. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] wants Homer to stay in his hotel room, but he escapes to party and attend a [[Kid Rock]] concert. Homer becomes the life of the Spring Break party &mdash; until spring break ends and the wild college kids return to catch up on their studies.

Homer, who still wants to party, rents an airboat and forces the family to come with him. He races through the [[swamp]], killing the town's most famous resident and reptile, an [[alligator]] named Captain Jack, whom Marge, [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] had seen on a tour while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. Despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator, but they flee from the sheriff and are hit by an [[Amtrak]] train. They escape to a restaurant and nearby trailer, where they become [[hillbilly|hillbillies]] and work until the sheriff tracks them down and kidnaps them while sleeping. For their crime (and the fact that Homer addressed the jury at their trial as "drunken hicks"), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working, the family encounters the alligator, who is not dead but was rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, but they are banned from returning to Florida. For their next trip (which is planned out on a map of the United States with nearly all of the continental states crossed out), the family plans to go to [[North Dakota]], the only state other than [[Arizona]] (which Homer complains "smells funny") in which they are allowed to vacation.

The episode seems to suffer from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]] as it can<U+2019>t focus on any topic for very long. It flits from one gag to another with abandon and rarely makes much sense <U+2013> or produces many laughs. Yeah, it has a few amusing moments, but it<U+2019>s too scattershot to succeed." <ref name=Jacobson/>
