Note: Asked to comment on the political impact of his 1995 admission, Obama stated in an October 2006 interview: "Oh, look, you know, when I was a kid, I inhaled. Frequently. That was the point. You know, it<U+2019>s, it<U+2019>s not something I make light of. It's something that I wrote actually about in my first book, and it was reflective of the struggles and confusion of a teen-age boy.

<blockquote>No, people don't expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice.</blockquote>

Questioning the [[George W. Bush's first term as President of the United States|Bush administration's]] management of the [[Iraq War]], Obama spoke of an enlisted [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], Corporal Seamus Ahern from [[East Moline, Illinois]], asking, "Are we serving Seamus as well as he is serving us?" He continued:
<blockquote>When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never, ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.</blockquote>

Finally, he spoke for national unity: 
<blockquote>The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into [[Red state vs. blue state divide|Red States and Blue States]]; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States. We coach [[Little League]] in the Blue States and yes, we got some gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.<ref>{{cite news | first=Barack | last=Obama | coauthors= | title=Keynote Address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention | date=[[July 27]] [[2004]] | publisher= | url =http://www.barackobama.com/2004/07/27/keynote_address_at_the_2004_de.php | work =BarackObama.com | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-18 | language = }}</ref></blockquote>

He was an early opponent of Bush administration policies on Iraq. In the fall of 2002, during an anti-war rally at Chicago's Federal Plaza, Obama said:

I am not opposed to all wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars. You want a fight, President Bush?

Obama has authored two bestselling books. The first, ''[[Dreams from My Father|Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance]]'', was published after his graduation from law school and before entering politics.

The book's last chapters describe his first visit to Kenya, a journey to connect with his [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]] family and heritage.  In his preface to the 2004 revised edition, Obama explains that he had hoped the story of his family "might speak in some way to the fissures of race that have characterized the American experience, as well as the fluid state of identity<U+2014>the leaps through time, the collision of cultures<U+2014>that mark our modern life."<ref>Obama (1995), p. vii.</ref> ''Time'' magazine's [[Joe Klein]] wrote that the book "may be the best-written memoir ever produced by an American politician."<ref>{{cite news | last=Klein | first=Joe | title=The Fresh Face | date=[[October 23]] [[2006]] | work=Time | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1546362,00.html |accessdate=2007-06-24 }} ([http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20061023,00.html cover image])</ref>

Obama's rapid rise from Illinois state legislator to U.S. presidential candidate has attracted conflicting analyses among commentators challenged to align him with traditional social categories. In her January 2007 ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' article asserting that Obama "isn't black," columnist [[Debra Dickerson]] writes: "lumping us all together [with Obama] erases the significance of [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] and continuing [[Racism in the United States|racism]] while giving the appearance of progress."<ref>{{cite news | first=Debra J | last=Dickerson | coauthors= | title=Colorblind | date= [[January 22]] [[2007]] | publisher= | url =http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/01/22/obama/index_np.html | work =Salon | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-27 | language = }}</ref> Expressing a similar view, ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist [[Stanley Crouch]] wrote: "When [[African American|black Americans]] refer to Obama as 'one of us,' I do not know what they are talking about."<ref>Crouch continues: "Obama makes it clear that, while he has experienced some light versions of typical [[racial stereotype]]s, he cannot claim those problems as his own <U+2014> nor has he lived the life of a black American." {{cite news | first=Stanley | last=Crouch | title=What Obama Isn't: Black Like Me | date=[[November 2]] [[2006]] | publisher= Alexa (cached copy) | url =http://vista.alexa.com/cgi-bin/docache?OCID=K0gsybDVz0st0U8sSjY3NdA31je2jDeINzIwMDcwMjI1NDYwMDKOTy5KLM8xMtMDKtJLr1LLT0srTi2xNTIxtTQzsjQCAA | work =New York Daily News | accessdate = 2007-03-27 | language = }}  See also: {{cite news | first=Clarence | last=Page | coauthors= | title=Is Barack Black Enough?
