'''Joe Colbeck''' (born 29 November 1986) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]] for [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]].

Born in [[Bradford]], England, he joined his hometown club, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], as a youth team player in 2002, making his debut two years later. He played more than 100&nbsp;league games for Bradford during five years in the first team. Colbeck nearly left Bradford in 2007 when he was made available for transfer and played six games on loan for [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. However, he returned following his loan spell and went on to win Bradford City's player of the season award during the [[Bradford City A.F.C. season 2007-08|2007&ndash;08]] campaign. He turned down a new deal a year later and joined [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on transfer deadline day in September 2009 to rejoin manager [[Dave Penney]], for whom he played at Darlington. When Penney was sacked after less than a year in charge, Colbeck also soon left and joined Hereford United.

==Playing style==
Colbeck is a pacy midfielder who normally plays on the [[midfielder#Winger|right wing]].<ref name="league two bullies">{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/1598433.league_two_bullies_dont_scare_colbeck/ |title=League Two bullies don't scare Colbeck |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2010-09-19 |publisher=''Telegraph & Argus'' |first=Simon |last=Parker}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/3660513.Daley__I_m_happy_where_I_am/ |title=Daley: I'm happy where I am |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2010-09-19 |publisher=''Telegraph & Argus'' |first=Simon |last=Parker}}</ref> Talking about his game, Colbeck says: "I love taking players on, I think that's my best attribute."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~1177035,00.html |title=Colbeck extends Quakers stay |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2010-10-08 |publisher=Darlington F.C.}}</ref> At Bradford, his manager [[Stuart McCall]] praised his hard work and commitment, but said he became frustrated about his lack of end product.

Before the season, he admitted he needed to score more goals<ref name="league two bullies"/> and went on to score six goals during the campaign, although it remains a career high.<ref name="soccerbase"/>
