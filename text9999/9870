'''Fort Dansborg'''{{Ref|a| '''a'''}}, locally called '''Danish Fort''', is a Danish fort located in the shores of [[Bay of Bengal]] in [[Tharangambadi]] in the [[South Indian]] [[states of India|state of Tamil Nadu]]. Fort Dansborg was built in the land ceded by Thanjavur king Ragunatha Nayak in an agreement with Danish Admiral [[Ove Gjedde]] in 1620 and acted as the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. The fort is the second largest Danish fort after [[Kronborg]]. The fort was sold to the British in 1845 and along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not an active trading post for the British. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum where the major artifacts of the fort and the Danish empire are displayed.

The fort was renovated twice in modern times, once by Tranquebar Association with the help of the Danish royal family and the State Archaeology Department in 2001 and secondly by a project named Destination Development of Tranquebar by the Department of Tourism of the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2011. The fort is one of the prominent tourist destinations in the region.

[[Coramandel coast|Coramandel]] was an active international trading coast from the 3rd century BCE. The [[European colonial empires]] like [[British Raj|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] established maritime trade with India during the early 17th century. The [[Danish East India Company]] was established in the capital of [[Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]] in 1616 and a mission was sent with Admiral Ove Gjedde (1594<U+2013>1660 CE).<ref name="Hamilton4578">[[#Hamilton|Hamilton 1820]], pp. 457<U+2013>8</ref><ref name="Arch">{{cite web|title=Danish Fort|url=http://www.tnarch.gov.in/cons/forts/fort6.htm|publisher=Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu|accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> Ove Gjedde signed a deal with the [[Thanjavur Nayak kingdom|Thanjavur]] ruler king [[Raghunatha Nayak]] (1600<U+2013>34) in 1620 in spite of resistance from the Portuguese. The rent was fixed as {{INR}}3111 per annum and a total of {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} by {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} area was ceded to the Danish mission. The treaty signed during November 1620 also allowed the Danes to collect taxes from the neighbouring villages of Tranquebar.

During the mid of 18th century, the commercial importance of the town declined and the centre of textile production moved to Serampore in the state of [[Bengal]]. But Tranquebar still remained the headquarters of the Colony. The fort and the town was sold to the [[British Raj|British]] in 1845 and, along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not a trading post anymore.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures:  Continental Europe and Its Empires|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ghah5S3usnsC&pg=PA98&dq=tranquebar+fort&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jcwOUqC_AYSs2wXj_4DwBg&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=tranquebar%20fort&f=false|page=98|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2008|last1=Poddar|first1=Prem|last2=Patke|first2= Rajeev Shridhar |last3=Jensen|first3=Lars|isbn=9780748623945}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Der d<U+00E4>nische Gesamtstaat: ein untersch<U+00E4>tztes Weltreich?|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FZQcjsSitEcC&pg=PA76&dq=fort+Dansborg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zxYDUqm3MoHJygHa24GYCw&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=fort%20Dansborg&f=false|pages=76<U+2013>77|last=Gobel|first=Eric|isbn=9783937719016|publisher=www.verlag-ludwig.de|year=2006}}</ref><ref name="G6869">[[#Gronseth|Gronseth 2007]], pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref><ref name="BBC">{{cite news|title=India's piece of Denmark|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2133655.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|last=Haviland |first=Charles |location=Tamil Nadu|accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref><ref name="Arch"/><ref name="front">{{cite journal|title=Danish flavour|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2622/stories/20091106262211800.htm|work=The Frontline|volume=26|series=22|date=October 24 <U+2013> November 06 2009|accessdate=2013-07-07|last=P.V.|first=Srividya}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: From Twelfth to the Mid-Eighteenth Century|last1=Ahmed|first1=Farooqui Salma|last2=Farooqui|first2=Salma Ahmed|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sxhAtCflwOMC&pg=PA361&dq=fort+Dansborg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zrwBUqy9K4e-9QSp2YBY&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=fort%20Dansborg&f=false|page=361|isbn=9788131732021|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Navies and State Formation: The Schumpeter Hypothesis Revisited and Reflected|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CDLwfJ2JYBcC&pg=PA97&dq=fort+Dansborg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zxYDUqm3MoHJygHa24GYCw&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=fort%20Dansborg&f=false|page=97|last=Backhaus|first=J<U+00FC>rgen G.|publisher=LIT Verlag M<U+00FC>nster|year=2012|isbn=9783643902122}}</ref>

Fort Dansborg is located in the southern part of [[Tharangambadi]], located {{convert|283|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Chennai]]. It is built in Danish style, characterized by large halls, columned structures, high ceilings and projecting drapery.<ref name="front"/> The length of the fort in the side facing the sea is {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the width is about {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The fort is trapezoidal in shape with three rooms in the left wing, originally used as the governor's residence, a kitchen with an open fireplace and chimney in the top left hand corner, and a church room, now a museum, located in the centre of the building. The original rectory and the northern part of it, which are now the store rooms, are located in the right wing. The corner room on the right side was the residence of the commercial director. In modern times, it is used as a store room. The core of the building is made of brick. The main door of the fort faces north, while an additional door faces the east.<ref name="Vol">{{cite book|title=Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia: Reflections on Cross-cultural Exchange Volume 2 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ni9AlOLTFZYC&pg=PA226&dq=tranquebar+fort&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NtAPUo39B-SF2QXUu4GoDQ&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=tranquebar%20fort&f=false|page=226|last1=Manguin|first1=Pierre-Yves|last2=A.|first2=Mani|last3=Wade|first3=Geoff|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian|year=2011|isbn=9789814345101}}</ref><ref name="arch28">[[#arch|Archaeological Survey of India 1903]], p. 28</ref><ref name="nic"/><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Cauvery, a living museum:

The citadel encloses a set of buildings, the notable ones being the fort built in 1620, the Masilamaninathar Temple built in the 13th century, the Zion Church built in 1701, the Town Gateway built in 1792, the Danish Governor Bungalow built in 1784 and a series of tomb stones built during the 17th and 18th century.

==Renovation in modern times==
The Tranquebar Association, formed in 2001, with the help of the Tamil Nadu State Archaeological Department and the Danish Royal family, restored the South end of the fort with the same kind of material like brick and black stone, used during the original construction. The renovation was completed in 2005, with contributions from local artisans, Danish volunteers, Danish and Indian experts.<ref name="G6869"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Capturing the lost magic|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2009/04/10/stories/2009041050840100.htm|work=The Hindu|last=Chari|first=Pushpa|date=10 April 2009|accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> In 2001, chemists from the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) restored the portrait of Raja Ragunatha Naik, Tranquebar site map, pottery, portrait of Christian IV, the Danish King.<ref name="nic">{{cite web|title=Tharangambadi|url=http://www.nagapattinam.tn.nic.in/tara.html|publisher=Nagapattinam District Administration|accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> Metal Halide lamps, which provide a uniform green-coloured lighting, were used for illuminating the exteriors.

There was a project planned by the Government of Tamil Nadu to lay stones along the shores to protect the fort and the Masilamaninathar Temple in Tharangambadi from erosion. While the project was planned much before the [[Indian Ocean Tsunami]] in 2005, it was implemented only in 2007. Before the tsunami, there was stiff resistance from the local villages citing impact to fishery in the region. Post tsunami, the resistance from the locals receded and the project was extended to accommodate additional areas of the shore.<ref name="Hastrup">{{cite book|title=Weathering the World: Recovery in the Wake of the Tsunami in a Tamil Fishing Village|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fTc7BFVYpl0C&pg=PA24&dq=fort+Dansborg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zxYDUqm3MoHJygHa24GYCw&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=fort%20Dansborg&f=false|last=Hatsrup|first=Frida|page=24|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857452009}}</ref>

The Department of Tourism Development of Tamil Nadu initiated a project named "Destination Development of Tranquebar". The project was started in 2011, with an estimated budget of {{INRConvert|3730800}} and planned a phased re-creation of the fort and the environs around it. As a part of the first phase of the project, cobble-stoned pathways were laid and ornamental cast iron street lamps were installed in the path around the fort. The cobble-stone pathways were laid for a total of {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} around the facade and for {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} on Goldsmith street. The first phase was completed at an expense of {{INRConvert|2430000}}. The second phase of the project involved the laying of cobble-stone pathways from the Tranquebar Arch to the river promenade. The second phase was completed at an expense of {{INRConvert|1300000}}. Environmental protection measures, like restraining movement of heavy vehicles around the fort to maintain the highest atmospheric ozone concentration, were also implemented.<ref name="project">{{cite news|title=Dansborg Fort set to get a facelift|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-editorialfeatures/dansborg-fort-set-to-get-a-facelift/article2231696.ece|date=16 July 2011|accessdate=2013-07-07|work=[[The Hindu]]|last=P.V.|first=Srividya|location=Nagapattinam}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Auroville Today|url=http://www.auroville.org/journals&media/avtoday/archive/2010-2011/AVToday-269-dec_2011.pdf|format=PDF|pages=1<U+2013>3|date=December 2011|publisher=Carel Thieme, Auroville Foundation|issue=260|accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref>

A factory was established soon after the fort was constructed and it minted coins that bore the initials TB or DB, indicating Dansborg.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Madras Presidency with Mysore, Coorg and the Associated States|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=O4VLY1KcltcC&pg=PA169&dq=fort+Dansborg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zxYDUqm3MoHJygHa24GYCw&ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=fort%20Dansborg&f=false|page=169|last=Thurston|first=Edgar |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781107600683}}</ref> The fort acted as the important gateway in the trade route from Europe to Coramandel. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Fredric IV]], who was also the head of [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran Church of Denmark]]. Two of them, namely, Bartholomaus Zeigenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, learnt [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in a few years and were the first to translate and print ''The New Testament'' of the ''Bible'' in Tamil in the printing press inside the fort.
