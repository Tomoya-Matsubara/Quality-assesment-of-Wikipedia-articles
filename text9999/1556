'''Lewis Archer''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the British soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. The character was created and introduced as a love interest for [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]). Executive producer Kim Crowther revealed the team wanted an actor who was slightly younger than Audrey and who was very charming. Various actors were considered for the part, but the casting director suggested Havers as she knew he was a big fan of the show. The actor said could not turn down a chance to appear in ''Coronation Street'' as his character had an interesting story arc. Havers was was contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut as Lewis in the episode broadcast on 18 December 2009.

Lewis is a gentleman escort, who is described as being suave, charming and charismatic. He is first seen accompanying [[Claudia Colby]] ([[Rula Lenska]]) to a Christmas ball. He is introduced to Audrey, who falls for his charm and she later hires him to be her companion to another event. In March 2010, Lewis was seen advertising his services in ''[[The Lady (magazine)|The Lady]]'', as part of a crossover between the society magazine and ''Coronation Street''. [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) sees the advert and books Lewis for a date, forming a love triangle storyline between them and Audrey. Lewis eventually declares his feelings for Audrey and they plan to leave [[Weatherfield]] together.

As their plans to emigrate step up a gear, Lewis forges a plan to steal money from [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]'s ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) [[Bookmaker|bookies]] by cashing in fraudulently franked betting slips. He sucessfully pulls off his scam and cheats on Audrey when he kisses [[Deirdre Barlow]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]). Lewis flees the country and he made his last appearance on 13 August 2010. Just over a year later, it was announced Havers would reprise his role as Lewis and return to ''Coronation Street'' in February 2012. The actor believed Lewis would be a changed man and said he just wants to apologise to those he hurt. The character and Havers' first turn in the show was well received by television critics.
