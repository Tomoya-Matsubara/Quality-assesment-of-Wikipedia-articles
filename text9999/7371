'''Body piercing''', a form of [[body modification]], is the practice of puncturing or cutting a part of the human body, creating an opening in which jewellery may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. While the history of body piercing is obscured by a lack of scholarly reference and popular misinformation, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.

Ear piercing and [[nose piercing]] have been particularly widespread and are well represented in historical records and among [[grave goods]]. The oldest [[mummy|mummified]] remains ever discovered were sporting [[earring]]s, attesting to the existence of the practice more than 5,000 years ago. Nose piercing is documented as far back as 1500 [[B.C.E]]. Piercings of these types have been documented globally, while [[Lip piercing|lip]] and [[tongue piercing]]s were historically found in African and American tribal cultures. [[Nipple piercing|Nipple]] and [[genital piercing]] have also been practiced by various cultures, with nipple piercing dating back at least to [[Ancient Rome]] while genital piercing is described in [[Ancient India]] ca. 320 to 550 [[Common Era|C.E.]] The practice of body piercing has waxed and waned in [[Western culture]], but it has experienced an increase of popularity since [[World War II]], with sites other than the ears gaining subcultural popularity in the 70s and spreading to mainstream in the 1990s.

The reasons for piercing or not piercing are varied. Some people pierce for religious or spiritual reasons, while others pierce for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for sexual pleasure, to conform to their culture or to rebel against it. Some forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to youth. The display or placement of piercings have been restricted by schools, employers and religious groups. In spite of the controversy, some people have practiced extreme forms of body piercing, with [[Guinness]] bestowing [[World Record]]s on individuals with hundreds and even thousands of permanent and temporary piercings.

Contemporary body piercing practices emphasize the use of safe [[body piercing materials]], frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, [[infection]], excessive [[scar]]ring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from as little as a month for some genital piercings to as much as two full years for the navel.

By the early part of the twentieth century, piercing of any body part had become uncommon in the West.<ref name=Porterfield/> After World War II, it began gathering steam among the [[homosexuality|gay male]] [[subculture]].<ref name=Porterfield/> Even ear piercing for a time was culturally unacceptable for women, but that relatively common form of piercing began growing in popularity from the 1960s.<ref name=Porterfield/> In the 1970s, piercing began to expand, as the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement embraced it, featuring nontraditional adornment such as [[safety pin]]s, and [[Fakir Musafar]] began popularizing it as a form of [[Modern Primitivism]], which incorporated piercing elements from other cultures, such as [[Stretching (body piercing)|stretching]].<ref name=Porterfield/>

Body piercing was also heavily popularized in the United States by a group of Californians including Malloy and [[Jim Ward (body piercer)|Jim Ward]], "the founding father of modern body piercing".<ref name=Angel5>Angel 2009, p. 15.</ref> In 1975, Ward opened a home-based piercing business in [[West Hollywood]], which was followed in 1978 by the opening of [[Gauntlet (body piercing studio)|Gauntlet Enterprises]], "the first professional body piercing specialty studio in America."<ref name=Angel5/> From it, Ward distributed the pamphlet which Malloy had written and Ward illustrated, disseminating much misinformation but stimulating interest in more exotic piercings.<ref name=Angel6>Angel 2009, p. 16.</ref> As word of body piercing spread to the wider community, Ward, Malloy and Musafar collaborated on launching the first publication dedicated to the subject, ''[[PFIQ]]''.<ref name=Angel5/>

A significant development in body piercing in England occurred in 1987, when during [[Operation Spanner]], a group of homosexuals<U+2014>including well known body piercer [[Alan Oversby]]<U+2014>were convicted of [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm|assault]] for their involvement in [[consent (criminal law)|consensual]] [[sadomasochism]] over a 10 year period, including acts of body piercing.<ref name=Angel5/> The courts declared that decorative body piercing was not illegal, but that erotic body piercing ''was''.<ref name=Pitts>{{cite book |title=In the Flesh: the Cultural Politics of Body Modification |last=Pitts |first=Victoria |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003 |isbn=0312293119 |page=95 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jGU30ca2s7wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0312293119&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate = 6 December 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, the group Countdown on Spanner formed in 1992 in protest.

Body modification in general became more popular in the United States in the 1990s, as piercing also became more widespread, with growing availability and access to piercings of the navel, nose, eyebrows, lips, tongue, nipples and genitals.<ref name=Porterfield/> In 1993, a navel piercing was depicted in [[MTV Video Music Awards]]' "Music Video of the Year", "[[Cryin'#Music video|Cryin']]," which inspired a plethora of young female fans to follow suit.<ref name=Angel6/> According to 2009's ''The Piercing Bible'', it was this consumer drive that "essentially inspired the creation of body-piercing as a full-fledged industry."<ref>Angel 2009, pp. 15<U+2013>16.</ref> Body piercing was given another media-related boost in 2004, when during a [[Half-time]] performance at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] singer [[Janet Jackson]] experienced a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]" that left exposed Jackson's pierced nipple.<ref name=CM11>{{cite book |title=Tattoos and Body Piercing |last=Currie-McGhee |first=Leanne K. |series=Lucent Overview Series |publisher=Lucent Books |year=2006 |page=11 |isbn=1590187490}}</ref> Some professional body piercers reported considerable increases in business following [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|the heavily publicized event]].<ref name=CM11/>

[[File:Piercing1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Hindu]] man in a religious procession with a trident piercing his cheeks]]
Reasons for piercing vary greatly. A 2001 survey in ''Clinical Nursing Research'', an international publication, found that 62% of people who pierced had done so in an effort "to express their individuality."<ref name=CM29>Currie-McGhee 2006, p. 29.</ref> People also pierce to commemorate landmark events or to overcome traumatic ones.<ref>Currie-McGhee 2006, pp. 30, 34.</ref> According to the assistant director of the Frankfurt University Teaching Hospital for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, some sexual abuse survivors choose body piercing as a means of "reclaiming body parts from memories of abuse".<ref name=CM34>Currie-McGhee 2006, p. 34.</ref> Piercing can also be chosen for simple aesthetic value, to highlight particular areas of the body, as a navel piercing may reflect a woman's satisfaction with the shape and condition of her stomach.<ref>Currie-McGhee 2006, p. 28.</ref> Some people pierce, permanently or temporarily, to enhance sexual pleasure. Genital and nipple piercings may increase sexual satisfaction.<ref name=CM29/><ref name=AFP>{{cite journal |title=Complications of Body Piercing |journal=American Family Physicians |last=Meltzer |first=Donna I. |date=15 November 2005 |volume=72 |issue=10 |pages=2029<U+2013>2034 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1115/p2029.html |accessdate=14 December 2009 }}</ref> Some people participate in a form of body play known as [[play piercing]], in which piercings may be done temporarily on the genitals or elsewhere on the body for sexual gratification.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Body Art Book |last=Miller |first=Jean-Chris |isbn=0425197263 |publisher=Penguin |year=2004 |page=121 }}</ref>

Piercing combined with [[Suspension (body modification)|suspension]] was historically important in the religious ceremonies of some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s, featuring in many variants of the [[Sun Dance]] ceremony,<ref name=Porterfield>{{cite book |title=Religion and American Cultures: an Encyclopedia of Traditions, Diversity, and Popular Expressions |volume=2 |editors=Gary Laderman and Luis D.

Some contemporary Southeast Asian rituals also practice body piercing, as a form of spiritual [[self-mortification]].  Generally, the subject attempts to enter an analgesic [[trance]] prior to the piercing.<ref>{{cite book |title=Southeast Asia: a Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor |volume=1 |last=Ooi |first=Keat Gin |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2004 |isbn=1576077705 |page=1139 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1576077705&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate = 5 December 2009}}</ref>

Bridging the gap between self-expressive piercing and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing and other forms of body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as a culturally binding ritual.<ref name=CM34/> But at the same time that piercing can be culturally binding, it may also be a means of rebellion, particularly for adolescents in Western cultures.<ref>Currie-McGhee 2006, p. 36.</ref>

==Piercing prohibitions and taboos==
While body piercing has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. In 2004, controversy erupted in [[Crothersville, Indiana]] when a local high school featured a spread on "Body Decorations" in its [[yearbook]] that featured tattoos and body piercings of teachers and students.<ref>Miller 2004, pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref> That same year, in [[Henry County, Georgia]], a 15-year-old boy remained in [[in-school suspension]] for a full month for violating school policy by wearing eyebrow, nose, labret and tongue piercings to school before his mother decided to [[Homeschooling|homeschool]] him.<ref>Miller 2004, p. 19.</ref> According to 2006's ''Tattoos and Body Piercing'', corporate [[dress code]]s can also strictly limit piercing displays. At that time, [[Starbucks]] limited piercings to two per ear and jewellery to small, matched earrings.<ref>Currie-McGhee 2006, pp. 76<U+2013>77.</ref> Employees of [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] were not permitted to display piercings at all.<ref name=CM77>Currie-McGhee 2006, p. 77.</ref>

Body piercing in some religions is held to be destructive to the body. Some passages of the [[Bible]], including [[Leviticus]] 19:28,<ref name=CM77/> have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God.<ref name=Angel3>Angel 2009, p. 13.</ref> [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women as long as there is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=810739b439c98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ |title=Body Piercing |publisher=The Church of Jesus Chris of Latter-day Saints |accessdate=14 December 2009 }}</ref> Wearing of nose rings on the [[Sabbath]] is forbidden by the [[Talmud]].<ref name=Hastings/>

==Contemporary piercing practises==
===Contemporary body piercing jewellery===
[[Body piercing jewellery]] should be [[hypoallergenic]].<ref>Miller 2004, p. 21.</ref> A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical [[stainless steel]], [[niobium]] and [[titanium]] are commonly used metals, with titanium the least likely to cause allergic reaction of the three.<ref name=M25>Miller 2004, p. 25.</ref> [[Platinum]] and [[palladium]] are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings.<ref name="Miller, 26">Miller 2004, p. 26.</ref> Initial piercings should never be done with [[gold]] of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and [[sterling silver]] is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will [[tarnish]] in piercings of any age.<ref name=M25/> An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.<ref name=AFP/>

Body piercing jewellery is measured by thickness and diameter/length. The thickness of the metal is measured on different charts, such as the U.S. [[Brown & Sharpe]] AWG gauging system, which assigns higher numbers to thicker middles.<ref name="Miller, 26"/> 00 gauge is {{mm to in |9.246|abbr=MOS|spell=commonwealth|precision=3|wiki=yes}}, while 20 gauge is {{mm to in |0.813|abbr=MOS|spell=commonwealth|precision=3}}.<ref>Miller 2004, p. 27.</ref>

===Piercing tools===
Permanent body piercings are performed by creating an opening in the body using a sharp object through the area to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually a hollow medical needle) or [[scalpel]] or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through [[scalpelling]].

Tools used in body piercing include:
;The piercing needle: The standard method in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, which is available in different lengths, gauges and even shapes.<ref name=A57>Angel 2009, p. 57.</ref> While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes with the aid of a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. In this method, the needle is the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with [[cartilage]] piercings) than the initial jewellery to be worn. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.<ref>Miller 2004, p. 103.</ref>
;The indwelling cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use a needle containing a [[cannula]] (or [[catheter]]), a hollow plastic tube placed at the end of the needle.<ref name=A58>Angel 2009, p. 58.</ref> In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers.<ref name=A58/> The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.
;The dermal punch: A dermal punch is used to remove a circular area of tissue, into which jewellery is placed, and may be useful for larger cartilage piercings.<ref name=A241>Angel 2009, p. 241.</ref> They are popular for use in ears, though not legal for use by nonmedical personnel in some parts of the United States.<ref name=A241/>
[[File:Ear Piercing Gun.jpg|thumb|Piercing guns, like this one with its plastic, non-autoclavable handle, are not professionally favored or recommended, even for ears.<ref name=A21/><ref name=M92/><ref name=CM56/>]]
;The piercing gun: Piercing guns, which were originally developed for [[Ear tag|tagging]] [[livestock]], are typically used for ear piercing, but may be used for other body parts as well.<ref name=A21>Angel 2009, p. 21.</ref> They cause more trauma to tissue than piercing needles and are generally not favoured by professional body piercers as well for hygienic reasons.<ref name=A21/><ref name=M92>Miller 2004, p. 92.</ref> Piercing with a piercing gun causes microsprays of plasma and blood; the guns frequently contain plastic components which are unable to be cleaned in an [[autoclave]] system, while surface cleansers do not kill all bacteria.<ref name=A21/><ref name=M92/> Piercing guns are frequently encountered in retail outlets, where those wielding them may be inadequately trained.<ref name=A21/> The [[Association of Professional Piercers]] recommends that piercing guns not be used for any piercing, including ears.<ref name=CM56>Currie-McGhee 2006, p. 56.</ref>
;Cork: Cork may be placed on the opposite side of the body part being pierced to receive the needle.<ref name=A58/>
;Forceps: [[Forceps]], or clamps, may be used to hold and stabilize the tissue to be pierced.<ref name=A58/> Most piercings that are stabilized with forceps use the triangular-headed "Pennington" forcep, while tongues are usually stabilized with an oval-headed forcep. Most forceps have large enough openings in their jaws to permit the needle and jewellery to pass directly through, though some slotted forceps are designed with a removable segment instead for removal after the piercing.<ref>Angel 2009, pp. 58<U+2013>59.</ref> Forceps are not used in the freehand method, in which the piercer supports the tissue by hand.<ref name=A60>Angel 2009, p. 60.</ref>
;Needle receiving tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant glass or plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, are used to support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings.<ref name=A59>Angel 2009, p. 59.</ref> Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.<ref name=A60/>
;Anaethesia: [[Anesthesia|Anaesthesia]] is supplied by some piercers, particularly in the United Kingdom and Europe.<ref>Angel 2009, p. 61.</ref> The anaesthesia may be [[Topical anesthetic|topical]] or injected. Piercers and other non-medical personnel are not legally permitted to administer anaesthetics in the United States.

===Risks associated with body piercing===
Body piercing is an invasive procedure with risks. In a 2005 survey of 10,503 persons over the age of 16 in England, complications were reported in 31% of piercings, with professional help being necessary in 15.2%.<ref name=BMJ/> 0.9% had complications serious enough to require hospitalization.<ref name=BMJ/>

Contemporary body piercing studios generally take numerous precautions to protect the health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law).<ref name=A56>Angel 2009, p. 56.</ref> Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area with the gloves he/she used to clean it. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves,<ref>Angel 2009, p. 37</ref> and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.

In addition, the Association of Professional Piercers recommends a class in [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne pathogens]] as part of professional training.<ref name=CM56/>

===The healing process and body piercing aftercare===
[[File:Plasma on body ring.jpg|thumb|right|Dried sebum deposit on body jewellery]]
The aftercare process for body piercing has evolved gradually through practise, and many myths and harmful recommendations persist.<ref>Angel 2009, pp. 180<U+2013>181.</ref> A reputable piercing studio should provide clients with written and verbal aftercare instructions, as is in some areas mandated by law.<ref>Angel 2009, p. 181.</ref>

The healing process of piercings is broken down into three stages:<ref>Angel 2009, pp. 181<U+2013>182.</ref>
*''The inflammatory phase'', during which the wound is open and bleeding, inflammation and tenderness are all to be expected;
*''The growth or proliferative phase'', during which the body produces cells and protein to heal the puncture and the edges contract around the piercing, forming a tunnel of scar tissue called a [[fistula]]. This phase may last weeks, months, or longer than a year.
*''The maturation or remodeling phase'', as the cells lining the piercing strengthen and stabilize. This stage takes months or years to complete.

It is normal for a white or slightly yellow [[exudate|discharge]] to be noticeable on the jewellery, as the [[Sebaceous gland]]s produce an oily substance meant to protect and moisturize the wound.<ref name=A182>Angel 2009, p. 182.</ref> While these [[Sebum#Sebum|sebum]] deposits may be expected for some time, only a small amount of [[pus]], which is a sign of inflammation or infection, should be expected, and only within the initial phase.<ref name=A182/> While sometimes difficult to distinguish, sebum is "more solid and cheeselike and has a distinctive rotten odor", according to ''The Piercing Bible''.<ref name=A182/>

The amount of time it typically takes a piercing to heal varies widely according to the placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the [[clitoral hood]] and Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may take longer.<ref name=M106>Miller 2004, p. 106.</ref> Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years.<ref name=M106/> The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.<ref name=AFP/>
