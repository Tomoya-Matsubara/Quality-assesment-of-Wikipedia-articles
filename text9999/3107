==Atomics== <!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Atomics (Dune)]] and [[Stoneburner]] -->
[[Image:Stoneburner.jpg|right|thumb|230px|A '''stone burner''' detonation, from the [[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|''Children of Dune'' miniseries]] (2003)]]
'''Atomics''' is the term used to refer to [[nuclear weapon]]s in the [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]].<ref name="Dune">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |date=1965 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= |quote=}}</ref> Like real-world nuclear weapons, atomics presumably derive their destructive force from [[nuclear reaction]]s of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]], and Herbert notes that "Radiation lingers" after their use.<ref name="Dune"/> However, the author never delves into the specifics of the technology or explores in detail how it may have evolved by the time of ''Dune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s far-future setting.

In the initial ''Dune'' novels, the Great Houses of the [[Landsraad]] own "family atomics" as heirlooms, keeping a secure, hidden cache as weapons of last resort in their wars.<ref name="Dune"/> Though such possession is necessary to secure power, the use of atomics against humans violates the chief prohibition of the [[List of Dune terminology#G|Great Convention]], the "universal truce enforced under the power balance maintained by the [[Spacing Guild|Guild]], the [[List of Family Houses in Dune|Great Houses]], and the Imperium."<ref name="Convention">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank  |title=Dune |chapter=Terminology of the Imperium: GREAT CONVENTION |date=1965 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= |quote=}}</ref> [[Paul Atreides]] notes in ''Dune'' that "The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: ''Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration''."<ref name="Dune"/> The atomics themselves act as a [[Deterrence theory|military deterrent]] &mdash; any House which violates the Great Convention flagrantly (such as using atomics openly in warfare) faces the possibility of massive retaliation from any number of the other Houses.<ref name="Dune"/> As Paul notes via [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969), "any Family in my Empire could so deploy its atomics as to destroy the planetary bases of fifty or more other Families."<ref name="Messiah">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Dune Messiah]] |date=1969 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= |quote=}}</ref>

One type of atomic weapon is the '''stone burner''', the explosion and radiation of which can be precisely adjusted depending on the desired effect.<ref name="Messiah"/> Stone burners emit "J-Rays", a form of radiation that has a tendency to destroy the eye tissue of anyone surviving the initial radiation blast.<ref name="Messiah"/> If of sufficient power, a stone burner can burn its way into the core of a planet, destroying it:
<blockquote>Paul remained silent, thinking what this weapon implied. Too much fuel in it and it'd cut its way into the planet's core. Dune's molten level lay deep, but the more dangerous for that. Such pressures released and out of control might split a planet, scattering lifeless bits and pieces through space.<ref name="Messiah"/></blockquote>

===The original series===
In ''Dune'', Paul uses an atomic device on the surface of [[Arrakis]] to blast a pass through a wild desert mountain range called the Shield Wall. He considers this act to be in accordance with the Great Convention because the atomics are not used against humans, but rather against "a natural feature of the desert."<ref name="Dune"/> A stone burner is used in an attempt to assassinate Paul in ''Dune Messiah''; he survives but is blinded for the rest of his life.<ref name="Messiah"/> In ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981), the [[Leto Atreides II|God Emperor Leto II]] notes that since his 3,500-year reign began he has "searched out all of the Family atomics and removed them to a safe place."<ref name="God Emperor">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[God Emperor of Dune]] |date=1981 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= |quote=}}</ref>

In the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] (1999-2001) it is revealed that a renegade House of the Landsraad had devastated the capital of the [[Padishah Emperor|Corrino Padishah Empire]], [[Salusa Secundus]], with atomics and rendered the planet essentially uninhabitable.<ref name="Prelude">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Herbert |coauthors=[[Kevin J.

The ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' prequel series (2002-2004) establishes that the first human victory of the [[Butlerian Jihad]] (the crusade against the [[thinking machines (Dune)|thinking machines]]) is the 200 B.G. destruction of Earth and the Earth [[Omnius]] using atomics.<ref name="Legends">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |coauthors=Kevin J.

==Axlotl tank== <!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Axlotl tank]] and [[Axolotl tank]] -->
{{For|the non-fictional animal|Axolotl}}
'''Axlotl tanks''' are a fictional technology in the [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. Axlotl technology is also mentioned in Herbert's novels ''[[Destination: Void]]'' and the ''[[The Jesus Incident]]'' but not elaborated upon. The name is presumably derived from the [[axolotl]], an aquatic salamander native to [[Mexico]] known for its regenerative abilities.

A [[trade secret]] of the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]], an axlotl tank is a "device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver,"<ref name="Heretics">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Heretics of Dune]] |date=1984 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= }}</ref> a type of [[cloning|clone]] called a [[ghola]].<ref name="Messiah"/> Later in the series, the axlotl tanks are engineered to be capable of producing the spice [[melange]], previously only available on the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]].<ref name="Heretics"/>

===The original series===
The tanks are briefly mentioned in ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969) as the source of the [[Duncan Idaho]] ghola.<ref name="Messiah"/><ref>It should be noted that both mentions of the tanks are spelled "axolotl" in ''Dune Messiah'', but Herbert spells the term "axlotl" in all later novels in the series. The non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]] (but approved by Herbert) ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia|Dune Encyclopedia]]'', compiled and published in 1984 between ''God Emperor of Dune'' and ''Heretics of Dune'', also uses the spelling "axolotl."</ref> Their nature is a well-guarded Tleilaxu secret. During his 3500-year reign which ends in ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981), [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] purchases countless Idaho gholas produced for him in the tanks.<ref name="God Emperor"/>

Within the 1500 years between the events of ''God Emperor of Dune'' and ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' (1984), the Tleilaxu discover an artificial method of producing the spice melange in their axlotl tanks as well.<ref name="Heretics"/>

In ''Heretics of Dune'', the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Janet Roxbrough|Lady Janet]] notes to her son [[Miles Teg]] that "No one outside of [the Tleilaxu] planets has ever reported seeing a Tleilaxu female." Wondering whether the Tleilaxu breed or simply rely on the tanks to reproduce, Miles asks, "Do they exist or is it just the tanks?"  Janet confirms that females do indeed exist.  Later in ''Heretics'', Teg's own daughter, [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Darwi Odrade]], theorizes that the axlotl tanks may be, in fact, "surrogate mothers" &mdash; Tleilaxu females somehow transformed.<ref name="Heretics"/> Soon, the current Duncan ghola recalls his repeated "births" from the tanks:
<blockquote>The axlotl tanks! He remembered emerging time after time:  bright lights and padded mechanical hands.  The hands rotated him and, in the unfocused blurs of the newborn, he saw a great mound of female flesh &mdash; monstrous in her almost immobile grossness ... a maze of dark tubes linked her body to giant metal containers.<ref name="Heretics"/></blockquote> 

In ''[[Chapterhouse Dune]]'', the last remaining Tleilaxu Master [[Scytale (Dune)|Scytale]] is coerced into revealing the means of creating the tanks to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood.<ref name="Chapterhouse">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Chapterhouse Dune]] |date=1985 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= }}</ref>

===''Prelude to Dune''===
In the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (1999-2001) by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] (which occurs before the events of 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''), the Tleilaxu attempt to create artificial melange using axlotl technology; the best results are gained by using a Bene Gesserit sister to create an axlotl tank. However, the project ultimately fails.<ref name="Prelude"/>

==Cymek== <!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Cymek]] -->
A '''cymek''' is a type of [[cyborg]], or machine-human [[hybrid]], in the fictional [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. They appear in the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (2002-2004) by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. The only organic part of a cymek is its brain; in the series, living humans willingly have their brains transplanted into large mechanized bodies with the intent of extending life indefinitely.<ref name="Legends"/>

===Prequels===
Over 11,000 years before the events of Frank Hertbert's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965), a group of 20 ambitious humans see the stagnation of the [[Old Empire (Dune)|Old Empire]] and realize that their small band can take control of it with the aid of [[thinking machines (Dune)|thinking machines]]. Calling themselves the [[Titan (Dune)|Titans]], they rule humanity for a hundred years and rename themselves after famous historical and mythological figures, most notably [[Titan (Dune)#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]], [[Titan (Dune)#Ajax|Ajax]], [[Titan (Dune)#Barbarossa|Barbarossa]], [[Titan (Dune)#Dante|Dante]], [[Titan (Dune)#Hecate|Hecate]], [[Titan (Dune)#Juno|Juno]], [[Titan (Dune)#Tlaloc|Tlaloc]] and [[Titan (Dune)#Xerxes|Xerxes]].<ref name="Legends"/>

Ten years into their reign, their leader Tlaloc is killed in a freak accident. Realizing their mortality and limited lifespans, they seek a way to extend their lives. Juno is inspired by the [[cogitor]]s, ancient philosophers whose brains had been installed in fluid-filled canisters so that they might analyze the universe indefinitely; they are living and retain awareness and consciousness, and the ability to communicate should they choose. The Titan Agamemnon is the first to become a cymek, his brain transplanted into a canister which, through special interfaces, is installed into a large, fearsome, and weaponized body. In cymek form, the remaining 19 Titans are virtually unstoppable, and continue their tyrnannical rule of the universe for another 90 years. Growing complacent, the Titans are themselves overthrown and enslaved by [[Omnius]], a [[Strong AI|sentient]] computer network given too much autonomy; Omnius controls the universe for the next 900 years. The Titans recruit humans from the enslaved, Omnius-controlled "[[Legends of Dune#Synchronized Worlds|Synchronized Worlds]]" to become '''neo-cymeks''', footsoldiers who could more fully understand human strategy and thought processes than machines.<ref name="Legends"/>

A small group of worlds, united as the [[League of Nobles]], resist the initial Titan rebellion and remain free from machine rule. With the thinking machines ever-persistent in their intent to enslave or destroy all humans, the League initiates the  [[Butlerian Jihad]], mankind's century-long crusade against the machines. The humans are ultimately victorious, destroying Omnius, the Titans, the neo-cymeks and all thinking machine forces. With all thinking machine technology henceforth banned, new organizations arise, composed of humans who had developed specialized skills during the Jihad to replace and exceed technology, including the [[Spacing Guild]], [[Mentat]]s, and the [[Bene Gesserit]].<ref name="Legends"/>

==Ghola==
{{main|Ghola}}
A '''ghola''' is a form of [[cloning|clone]] grown in an [[axlotl tank]] from genetic material retrieved from the cells of a deceased subject, using a technological process developed and [[monopoly|monopolized]] by the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]].<ref name="Messiah"/>

==Heighliner==  <!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Heighliner]] -->
[[Image:Heighliner.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Spacing Guild]] '''heighliner''' from the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|''Dune'' miniseries]] (2000)]]
A '''heighliner''' is a type of fictional [[starship]] used for [[interstellar travel]] in the [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. These enormous spaceships are the "major cargo carrier of the [[Spacing Guild]]'s transportation system."<ref name="Dune Term">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank  |title=Dune |chapter=Terminology of the Imperium |date=1965 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= |quote=}}</ref>

[[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] says of them in ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965):
<blockquote>A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner &mdash; we'll be just a small part of the ship's manifest.<ref name="Dune"/></blockquote>

Heighliner operation requires both a [[Holtzman effect#Holtzman drive|Holtzman drive]] and a [[Guild Navigator]]. The drive uses the [[Holtzman effect]] to "fold space" and allow virtually instantaneous interstellar travel. The Navigator uses a limited form of [[prescience]] to find a safe path through folded space and guide the ship, which is made possible through the use of [[melange]].<ref name="Appendix III">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank  |title=Dune |chapter=Appendix III: Report on Bene Gesserit Motives and Purposes |date=1965 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= |quote=}}</ref> Navigators are confined to giant tanks, completely immersed in highly-concentrated orange spice gas.<ref name="Messiah"/>

Unable to land, heighliners jump from point to point, parking in planetary orbits. Orbital ferries or interplanetary spacecraft load and unload the heighliner. Special laws govern travel aboard a heighliner; heighliners are considered [[neutral territory]] and all acts of war aboard heighliners carry stiff penalties.

According to the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (2002-2004), heighliners are invented by [[Norma Cenva]] during the [[Butlerian Jihad]].<ref name="Legends"/> The ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' prequel trilogy (1999-2001) establishes that in subsequent millennia, the ships are manufactured on the planet [[Ix (Dune)|Ix]].<ref name="Prelude"/> During the events described in the 2001 prequel ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'', a heighliner is expertly spacefolded into a cavern under the surface of Ix, incapacitating an occupying army during the Atreides-led liberation of the planet.<ref name="House Corrino">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |coauthors=Kevin J.

The '''Holtzman effect''' is a scientific phenomenon which makes defensive force shields and instantaneous space travel (among other things) possible through its application in [[Holtzman shield]]s, [[foldspace]] or [[Holtzman drive]]s, [[suspensor (Dune)|suspensor]]s and [[glowglobe]]s.<ref name="Dune Term"/>

==Ixian Probe== <!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Ixian Probe]] -->

As described in ''Heretics of Dune'', the probe is an [[interrogation]] device of [[Ix (Dune)|Ix]]ian manufacture which "can raid the mind even of a dead person." <ref name="Heretics"/> However, the substance [[List of Dune terminology#S|shere]] blocks the effects of the probe, and will protect a person who has taken it even in death.<ref name="Heretics"/> The probe itself or how it works are not described, but when [[Miles Teg]] sees a [[T-Probe]] for the first time, he believes it is an Ixian Probe.<ref name="Heretics"/> The T-Probe consists of a hood with a series of [[electrode]]s attached to the skull, controlled by an operator; the notable difference is that shere has no effect against a  T-Probe.<ref name="Heretics"/>

==No-chamber/No-ship==  <!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[No-chamber]], [[No-room]], [[No-globe]], [[No-ship]] and [[Ithaca (Dune)]]-->
[[Image:FrankHerbert ChapterhouseDune 1st-No-ship.jpg|right|thumb|230px|A '''no-ship''', from the cover of ''[[Chapterhouse Dune]]'' (1985)]]
A '''no-chamber''' is a fictional technology in the [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. Originally called a '''no-room''' in Herbert's ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981),<ref name="God Emperor"/> it is a construct that hides anything inside from [[prescience|prescient]] vision, as well as more conventional means of detection.<ref name="Heretics"/> A '''no-globe''' is a larger construction of no-chambers, and a '''no-ship''' is a no-chamber in [[starship]] form, with enough limited prescience to be capable of [[interstellar travel]] without the use of a [[Guild Navigator]].<ref name="Heretics"/>

===The original series===
In ''God Emperor of Dune'', [[Leto Atreides II|Leto II]] deduces that the new [[Ix (Dune)|Ix]]ian Ambassador [[Hwi Noree]] had been "born" in what would come to be known as a no-room to shield her creation and upbringing from him.<ref name="God Emperor"/> Hwi had been created by the Ixians from the cells of Leto's friend/nemesis [[Malky (Dune)|Malky]] but as Malky's direct opposite &mdash; using [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[ghola]] technology &mdash; designed to be irresistible to Leto.<ref name="God Emperor"/> The no-room is an improvement upon a device the Ixians had previously created for Leto to record his thoughts into a written journal and hide them from prescient vision.<ref name="God Emperor"/>

In ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' (1984), [[Miles Teg]], the [[Bene Gesserit]] [[Lucilla (Dune)|Lucilla]] and the [[Duncan Idaho]] ghola hide in a no-globe on [[Gammu (Dune)|Gammu]], created by the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]] millennia before when the planet had been called [[Giedi Prime]].<ref name="Heretics"/> It is a sizeable complex, noted to be "Very ancient but the chambers are still intact and functioning."<ref name="Heretics"/> The exact era of its creation is not specified, but it is written that "Gammu was Giedi Prime, a Harkonnen place ... They were rich ... Rich enough to accomplish the secret installation of a no-room ... even of a large no-globe ... Bribes, third-party purchases, many transshipments ... The [[Famine Times]] were very disruptive and before that there were all those millennia of the [[Leto Atreides II|Tyrant]] ... When the Harkonnens kept their heads down or lost them."<ref name="Heretics"/>

No-ships are in use at the time of ''Heretics of Dune''; like no-chambers, anything inside a no-ship is hidden from prescient vision and other means of detection.<ref name="Heretics"/> However, a no-ship has much greater technological capability than a no-chamber, as it can perform the functions of a Guild Navigator.<ref name="Heretics"/> Specifically, a no-ship's [[computer]] is capable of enough limited prescience to successfully navigate its way through [[foldspace]]. Teg steals a massive no-ship from the fierce [[Honored Matres]] on Gammu in ''Heretics of Dune'', and its Great Hold alone is noted to be one kilometer in length, large enough to transport an adult [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]].<ref name="Heretics"/> In ''[[Chapterhouse Dune]]'' (1985), the Bene Gesserit initially confine Duncan and [[Murbella]] to this no-ship on [[Chapterhouse (Dune)|Chapterhouse]] for their own protection from prescient spying. As Murbella becomes the leader of a [[New Sisterhood]] comprised of both the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, Duncan and Teg flee Chapterhouse with [[Sheeana]] and other passengers on the no-ship.<ref name="Chapterhouse"/>

In ''Heretics of Dune'' and ''Chapterhouse Dune'' it is suggested that certain characters with [[House Atreides|Atreides]] ancestry are capable of using their prescient powers to "see" no-ships.<ref name="Heretics"/><ref name="Chapterhouse"/> The ability to nullify no-field invisibility is unleashed in Miles Teg after he is interrogated with to a device called a [[T-Probe]].<ref name="Chapterhouse"/> Teg's subsequent ghola duplicate also retains that unique ability after his memories are re-awakened.<ref name="Chapterhouse"/>

===Sequels===
In ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007), the novels by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] which complete Frank Herbert's original series, the fleeing no-ship is named the '''''Ithaca''''' by its passengers in homage to the long journey of the [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek]] hero [[Odysseus]] to his home of [[Ithaca]]. Accompanying Duncan, Teg and Sheeana are some 150 refugees, including the (apparent) last Tleilaxu Master [[Scytale (Dune)|Scytale]], some Bene Gesserit Sisters and a group of secret [[Jew]]s. They seek a new world onto which to introduce the captive [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]] on board, as well as a new home for the Jews, but are in constant pursuit by the [[Daniel and Marty|Unknown Enemy]] who seek to ensnare the ship in an inescapable [[tachyon net]]. With the help of genetic material possessed by Scytale, the  passengers of the ''Ithaca'' begin growing gholas of historical heroes such as [[Paul Atreides]] and [[Lady Jessica]] to assist them in the [[kralizec|final battle]] they know is coming against the Unknown Enemy.<ref name="Hunters">{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |coauthors=Kevin J.

[[Image:Fremen-1984.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Fremen]] wearing [[stillsuit]]s, from ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984)]]
A '''stillsuit''' is a fictional body suit in [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]], first introduced in the 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''<ref name="Dune"/> and appearing in every subsequent novel in the series. Stillsuits are worn by the native [[Fremen]] of the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]] to maintain their body moisture in the harsh environment.<ref name="Dune"/> ''[[The Science of Dune]]'' (2008) analyzes Herbert's stillsuit and its feasibility in the [[Real life (reality)|real world]] as described.<ref name="Science of Dune"/><ref name="SmartPopBooks"/><ref name="DailyCamera"/>

===Description===
As described in  ''Dune'', a stillsuit is a "body-enclosing garment" of Fremen design which performs the "functions of heat dissipation and filtering bodily wastes," as well as retaining and reclaiming moisture.<ref name="Dune Term"/> As the planetologist [[Liet-Kynes]] is assisting [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] with the fitting of his stillsuit, he explains it in this manner:
<blockquote>It's basically a micro-sandwich &mdash; a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system. The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body ... near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers . . . include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt's reclaimed. Motions of the body, especially breathing and some osmotic action provide the pumping force. Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck... Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to ensure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day..."<ref name="Dune"/></blockquote>

===Analysis===
In his essay "Stillsuit" in ''The Science of Dune'', John C. Smith suggests that "Stillsuits designed using strict literal interpretations from the ''Dune'' books probably would not work and most likely would cook the wearer like a [[Crock-Pot]] ... However, engineering solutions can be envisioned for all the suit's shortcomings."<ref name="DailyCamera"/>

As described in ''Heretics of Dune'', the probe is a non-[[Ix (Dune)|Ix]]ian [[interrogation]] device brought by the [[Honored Matres]] from [[The Scattering]]. It is attached to the body through a series of "medusa contacts" placed around the skull and on major nerve centers. An operator can increase or decrease the power supplied to the probe to maximize its efficacy while at the same time not overloading the nervous system of the subject. While being subjected to the probe, [[Miles Teg]]'s [[Mentat]] thinking deduces that not only can it "command his body as though he had no thinking part in his own behavior,"  but also "The whole spectrum of his senses could be copied into this T-probe and identified ... The machine could trace those out as though it made a duplicate of him."<ref name="Dreamer"/> The probe builds a 'digital framework' of the person which can be subjected to stimuli, and will respond as the person would. The T-Probe also causes massive, virtually unendurable pain in a living subject. Unlike [[Ixian Probe]]s, a T-Probe's function cannot be blocked by the substance [[List of Dune terminology#S|shere]]. The T-Probe is what causes [[Miles Teg]]'s brain to change its structure, giving him the blinding speed and amazing abilities seen in end of ''Heretics of Dune''.  This mental alteration continues in Teg even after being 'reborn' as a [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] [[ghola]] in ''Chapterhouse Dune''.<ref name="Chapterhouse"/>
