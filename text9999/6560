Bookham was originally called Bogolong and inspired [[Banjo Paterson]]'s poem ''Old Pardon the Son of Reprieve'', based on  his childhood memories of races on the Bogalong Racetrack.  There are two churches: the Uniting Church (c1926) and the Catholic Church, St Columbas (c1910). <ref>[http://bookham.visitnsw.com/HolidayLocation/TNSW600967CT.htm Tourism NSW ''Bookham''] </ref>
