While primarily built to serve the [[Expo 2005]] fair site, the line is still operating to serve the local community.

Linimo is owned and operated by {{nihongo|'''Aichi Rapid Transit Co., Ltd.'''|<U+611B><U+77E5><U+9AD8><U+901F><U+4EA4><U+901A><U+682A><U+5F0F><U+4F1A><U+793E>|Aichi K<U+014D>soku K<U+014D>ts<U+016B> Kabushiki Gaisha}}. Linimo claims<ref name="first">{{cite web|title=Magnetbahnforum &#124; Linimo Urban Maglev|accessdate=September 20, 2013|url=http://magnetbahnforum.de/index.php?en_faf_linimo}}</ref> to be the world's first commercial automated "Urban Maglev", although it was predated by the [[Birmingham Maglev]] (1984-1995), the [[M-Bahn|Berlin M-Bahn]] (1989-1991) and the [[Shanghai Maglev Train|Shanghai Maglev]] (2004-).

==Specifications==
The [[linear motor]] magnetic-levitated train has a top speed of {{convert|100|km/h}}, floating {{convert|8|mm}} above the track when in motion, and is intended as an alternative to conventional [[rapid transit|metro]] systems, not [[high-speed rail|high-speed operation]].  The line has nine stations and is {{convert|8.9|km}} long, with a minimum operating radius of {{convert|75|m}} and a maximum gradient of 6%. The trains were designed by the [[Chubu HSST Development Corporation]], which also operates a test track in Nagoya.  Construction of the track cost <U+00A5>60 billion (US$575 million) while the Linimo trains themselves, built by [[Nippon Sharyo]], cost <U+00A5>40.5 billion (US$380 million).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_5_44/ai_n6054072 |title = Nagoya builds Maglev Metro |publisher =  International Railway Journal |date =  May 2004}}</ref>  The overall construction cost thus came to roughly $100 million per km.

==Technical and financial difficulties==
Being the first commercial implementation of a new type of transport system, the line suffered a number of highly publicized technical breakdowns during the Expo, with far higher demand during peak hours than the line's carrying capacity of 4,000 [[pphpd|passengers per direction per hour]]. On March 19, 2005 and again on March 24, the number of people inside the trains exceeded the design capacity of 244 passengers and the train was unable to levitate.  The line also has to be shut down for safety reasons when wind speed exceeds 25&nbsp;m/s, a relatively common occurrence in the area.

During the Expo, the line carried an average of 31,000 passengers per day, but ridership dropped to only 12,000 in the first six months after the Expo, and the line lost over <U+00A5>3 billion in 2006.  While ridership gradually increased to 16,500 passengers per day in 2008,<ref>http://www.linimo.jp/kaisya/riyousyasu/riyousyasu.pdf</ref> the line still made a financial loss of <U+00A5>2.1 billion in fiscal year 2009.<ref>http://www.linimo.jp/kaisya/kessann/21_kessann_koukoku.pdf</ref>

==Construction History==
* October 3, 2001 &mdash; Permission to build the line granted
* March 6, 2005 &mdash; Line opened to the public
* July 3, 2005 &mdash; Ten millionth passenger
* April 1, 2006 &mdash; Stations L07 and L09 renamed

==Cancelled plan in Taiwan==
In 2006, there was a plan to use the system for Xinyi LRT ([[:zh:<U+4FE1><U+7FA9><U+5340><U+8F15><U+8ECC><U+6377><U+904B><U+7CFB><U+7D71>|<U+4FE1><U+7FA9><U+8F15><U+8ECC>]]), a proposed line in [[Xinyi, Taipei|Xinyi]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.iot.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=148969&ctNode=1066 <U+78C1><U+6D6E><U+6377><U+904B> <U+958B><U+9032><U+4FE1><U+7FA9><U+5546><U+5708>?] (Will manglev metro expand the commercial zone of Xinyi?), a report on [[China Times]], June 23, 2006.
