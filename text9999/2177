The '''[[Boeing]] B-17 Flying Fortress''' is an [[United States|American]] four-engine heavy [[bomber]] [[aircraft]] developed for the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] (USAAC). Competing against [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] for a contract to build 200 planes, the airplane outperformed both the other entries and the Air Corps' expectations. Although losing the contract due to an accident, the Air Corps was so in favor of the B-17 that they ordered 13 B-17s regardless. Evolving through numerous [[B-17 Flying Fortress variants|design stages]], from B-17A to G, the Flying Fortress is considered the first truly mass-produced large aircraft.

The B-17 was primarily involved in the daylight precision [[strategic bombing]] campaign of [[World War II]] against [[Germany|German]] industrial targets. The [[United States]] [[Eighth Air Force]] based in [[England]] and the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] based in [[Italy]] complemented the [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s night-time area bombing in [[Operation Pointblank]], which helped secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for [[Battle of Normandy|Operation Overlord]].<ref name="Carey Pointblank">{{cite journal | last =Carey | first =Brian Todd | title =Operation Pointblank: Evolution of Allied Air Doctrine During World War II | journal =World War II  | volume = | issue =November | pages = p. 4 | publisher = | date =1998 | url =http://www.historynet.com/air_sea/airborne_operations/3026416.html?page=4&c=y | id = | accessdate =2007-01-15 }}</ref> The B-17 also participated, to a lesser extent, in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|War in the Pacific]].

From its pre-war inception, the USAAC touted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a high-flying, long-ranging potent bomber capable of defending itself. With the ability to return home despite extensive battle damage, its durability, especially in belly-landings and ditchings<!--might need some links-->, quickly took on mythical proportions.<ref>{{cite book |title= B-17 Pilot Training Manual |origdate= |url= http://www.stelzriede.com/ms/html/mshwpmn1.htm |accessdate= 2007-01-16 |edition= |date= |publisher= Headquarters, AAF, Office of Flying Safety |location= |isbn= |chapter= The Story of the B-17 |chapterurl= http://www.stelzriede.com/ms/html/mshwpmn1.htm#sty |quote= The B-17's incredible capacity to take it <U+2014> to come flying home on three, two, even one engine, sieve-like with flak and bullet holes, with large sections of wing or tail surfaces shot away <U+2014> has been so widely publicized that U.

Of the 1.5 million tonnes of bombs dropped on Germany, 500,000 tonnes were dropped from B-17s.

==Design and development==
On [[8 August]] [[1934]], the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) tendered a proposal for a multi-engined bomber to replace the [[Martin B-10]]. Requirements were that it would carry a "useful bombload" at an altitude of 10,000 feet for 10 hours with a top speed of at least 200 mph.<ref name="Northstar">{{cite web |url= http://northstargallery.com/Aircraft/B17/about.htm |title= Aviation Photography:B-17 Flying Fortress |accessdate=2007-01-16 |format= |work= Northstar Gallery}}</ref><ref name="299 Development">{{cite web |last = Goebel

Boeing competed with the [[B-18 Bolo|Douglas DB-1]] and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] Model 146 for the Air Corps contract.

[[Image:Boeing Model 299 crash.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Crashed Model 299]]
The prototype B-17, designated '''Model 299''', was designed by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and [[Edward Curtis Wells]] and built at [[Boeing]]'s own expense.<ref name="299 Development"/>  It combined features of the experimental [[Boeing XB-15]] bomber with the [[Boeing 247]] transport airplane.<ref name="Northstar"/> The first Boeing aircraft with a flight-deck instead of an open cockpit, the B-17 was armed with both bombs (up to 4,800 pounds, on two racks in the bomb bay behind the cockpit) and five .30 caliber [[machine gun]]s, and was powered by Pratt & Whitney R-1690 radial engines each producing 750 Horsepower at 7,000 feet.<ref name="299 Development"/>

The first flight of the Model 229 was on [[28 July]] [[1935]], with Boeing chief test-pilot Les Tower at the controls.<ref>{{cite book | last =Salecker | first =Gene Eric | title =Fortress Against the Sun: The B-17 Flying Fortress in the Pacific | publisher = Combined Publishing  | date =2001 | location =Conshohocken, Pennsylvania | pages =p. 46 | url = | doi = | isbn =1-58097-049-4 | quote= | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="first flight"/> Richard Williams, a reporter for the [[The Seattle Times|''Seattle Times'']] coined the name "Flying Fortress" when the Model 299 was rolled out, bristling with multiple machine gun installations.<ref>{{cite book | last =Yenne | first =Bill | title =B-17 at War | publisher =Zenith Imprint  | date =2006 | location =St Paul, Minnesota | pages =p. 12| url = | doi = | isbn =0-7603-2522-7 | accessdate = 2006-12-18 }}</ref> Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use. On [[20 August]] the prototype flew from [[Seattle]] to Wright Field in nine hours and three minutes at an average speed of 235 mph, much faster than the competition.<ref name="299 Development"/>

At the fly-off, the four-engine Boeing design displayed superior performance over the twin-engine DB-1 and Model 146, and Admiral [[Frank Maxwell Andrews]] of the [[United_States_Army_Air_Corps#GHQ_Air_Force|GHQ Air Force]] believed that the long-range capabilities of four-engine large aircraft were more efficient than shorter-ranged twin-engined airplanes. His opinions were shared by the Air Corps procurement officers and, even before the competition was finished, they suggested buying 65 B-17s.<ref name="Tate 165">{{cite book |last= Tate |first= Dr. James P. |title= The Army and Its Air Corps: Army Policy toward Aviation 1919-1941 |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= http://books.google.ca/books?vid=ISBN1428912576&id=pZyLTfJFaEgC&dq=The+Army+and+Its+Air+Corps+Army+Policy+toward+Aviation |accessdate= 2006-01-16 |edition= |year= 1998 |month= June |publisher= Air University Press |location= Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama  |isbn= 1428912576 |pages= 165 |quote= }}</ref>

Development continued on the Boeing Model 299, and on [[30 October]] [[1935]], the Army Air Corps test-pilots Ployer, Hill, and Tower, took the Model 299 on a second evaluation flight.  The crew forgot to disengage the airplane's "gust lock", a device that held the bomber's movable control surfaces in place while the plane was parked on the ground, and having taken off, the aircraft entered a steep climb, stalled, nosed over and crashed, killing the crew.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2478 |title= Model 299 Crash, 15 November 1935 |accessdate=2007-01-16 |format= |work= National Museum of the USAF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.atctraining.faa.gov/afss/history/checklst.htm |title= How the Pilot's Checklist Came About | last = Schamel | first = John | quote = On board the plane were pilots Major Ployer P.

The crashed Model 299 could not finish the evaluation, and while the Air Corps was still enthusiastic about the aircraft's potential,  Army officials were daunted by the much greater expense per aircraft.<ref>{{cite book | last =Salecker | first =Gene Eric | title =Fortress Against the Sun: The B-17 Flying Fortress in the Pacific | publisher = Combined Publishing  | date =2001 | location =Conshohocken, Pennsylvania | pages =p. 48 | url = | doi = | isbn =1-58097-049-4 | quote= | accessdate = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Goebel | first =Greg |url= http://www.vectorsite.net/avb17_1.html#m2 |title= Model 299 Flying Fortress |year =2005 |accessdate=2007-01-09 |format= |work= The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|quote=The Model 299 cost almost $200,000, more than twice as much as either of its two competitors.}}</ref> Army Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] cancelled the order for 67 B-17s, and ordered 133 of the twin-engine Douglas B-18 Bolo instead.<ref name="Tate 165"/><ref name="299 Development"/>

==Operational service==
[[Image:B-17 Flying Fortress.jpg|thumb|right|250px|B-17 Flying Fortresses over Eastern Europe during World War II]]
The B-17 entered [[World War II]] with the RAF in 1941, was joined by USAAF [[Eighth Air Force]] and [[Fifteenth Air Force]] units in 1942, and was primarily involved in the daylight precision [[strategic bombing]] campaign against [[Germany|German]] industrial targets. [[Operation Pointblank]] guided attacks in preparation for a ground assault.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Carey | first =Brian Todd | title =Operation Pointblank: Evolution of Allied Air Doctrine During World War II | journal =World War II  | volume = | issue =November | pages = p. 4 | publisher = | date =1998 | url =http://www.historynet.com/air_sea/airborne_operations/3026416.html?page=4&c=y | id = | accessdate =2007-01-15 }}</ref>

===The RAF===
The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) entered World War II with no heavy bomber of its own and while by 1941, the [[Short Stirling]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]] had become its primary bombers, in early 1940, the RAF entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army Air Corps to be provided with 20 B-17Cs, redesignated  '''Fortress I'''. Their first operation was against [[Wilhelmshaven]] on [[8 July]] [[1941]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Yenne | first =Bill | title =B-17 at War | publisher =Zenith Imprint  | date =2006 | location =St Paul, Minnesota | pages =p. 23| url = | doi = | isbn =0-7603-2522-7 | accessdate = 2006-12-18 }}</ref><ref name="B-17B-D"/><ref>{{cite book | last =Chant | first =Christopher | title =Warplanes of the 20th Century | publisher =Tiger Books International  | date =1996 | location =London | pages =p.61-62| url = | isbn =1-85501-807-1 | accessdate = }}</ref> At the time, the Air Corps considered high-altitude flight to be 20,000 feet but, to avoid being intercepted by fighter planes, the RAF bombed the naval barracks from 30,000 feet.<ref name="Fortress I In Combat">{{cite web |last = Goebel |first =Greg |url= http://www.vectorsite.net/avb17_1.html#m5 |title= RAF Fortress I In Combat |year =2005  |accessdate=2007-01-09 |format= |work= The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|quote=}}</ref> They were unable to hit their targets and temperatures were so low that the machine guns froze up.<ref name="Fortress I for RAF">{{cite web |last = Baugher |first =Joe |url= http://home.att.net/~jbaugher2/b17_6.html |title= Fortress I for RAF |accessdate=2007-01-15 |format= |work= Encyclopedia of American Aircraft}}</ref> On [[July 24]] they tried another target, [[Brest, France|Brest]] in [[France]], but again missed completely.

By September, the RAF had lost eight B-17Cs in combat or to accidents, and [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber command]] had abandoned daylight bombing raids due to the Fortress I's poor performance. The remaining aircraft were transferred to different commands and used for various duties.<ref name="Fortress I for RAF"/> The experience had showed both the RAF and USAAF that the B-17C was not ready for combat, and that improved defenses, larger bombloads and more accurate bombing methods were required, which would be incorporated in later variations.  Moreover, even with these improvements, it was the USAAF and not the RAF that was willing to remain faithful to using the B-17 as a "day" bomber.<ref name="Fortress I In Combat"/>

===The USAAF===
For the Air Corps (renamed [[United States Army Air Force]] or USAAF in 1941), the B-17 and other bombers were able to accurately bomb from high altitudes by the use of the then-secret [[Norden Bombsight]], which was an optical electro-mechanical gyro-stabilized computer.  During daylight bombing missions and sorties, the device was able to determine, from variables input by the bombardier, the point in space at which the bomber's [[ordnance]] type should be released to hit the target.  The bombardier essentially took over flight control of the aircraft during the bomb run, maintaining a level attitude during the final moments.<ref name="Baugher B-17B">{{cite web |last = Baugher |first =Joe |url= http://home.att.net/~jbaugher2/b17_4.html |title= Boeing B-17B Fortress |accessdate=2007-01-15 |format= |work= Encyclopedia of American Aircraft}}</ref>

The USAAF began building up its air forces in Europe using B-17Es soon after entering the war.  The first [[Eighth Air Force]] units arrived in [[High Wycombe, England]] on [[12 May]] [[1942]], to form the 97th Bomb Group.<ref name="Northstar"/> On [[17 August]] [[1942]], 18 B-17Es of the 97th, including ''Yankee Doodle'', flown by Brigadier General Ira Eaker, were escorted by RAF [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] on the first USAAF raid over Europe, against railroad [[Classification yard|marshalling yards]] at [[Rouen]]-Sotteville in France.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aviation-history.com/boeing/b17.html | title = Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress <U+2013> USA | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | last = | first = | date = | work = The Aviation History Online Museum | quote = }}</ref><ref name="Northstar"/> The operation was a success, with only minor damage to two aircraft.

===Combined offensive===
The two different strategies of the American and British Bomber commands were organized at the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943. The resulting [[Operation Pointblank]] described a "Combined Bomber Offensive" that would weaken the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Wehrmacht]] and establish air superiority in preparation of a ground offensive.<ref name="Carey Pointblank"/>

Operation Pointblank opened with attacks on targets in Western Europe. General [[Ira C. Eaker]] and the Eighth Air Force placed highest priority on attacks on the German aircraft industry, especially fighter assembly plants, engine factories and ball-bearing manufacturers.<ref name="Carey Pointblank"/>

On [[17 April]] [[1943]], an attack on the [[Focke-Wulf]] plant at [[Bremen]] by 115 Fortresses met with little success. Sixteen aircraft were shot down, and 48 others were damaged.<ref name="Fortress over Europe">{{cite web |last = Goebel |first =Greg |url= http://www.vectorsite.net/avb17_2.html |title= Fortress Over Europe |year =2005  |accessdate=2007-01-09 |format= |work= The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|quote=}}</ref> The attacks did succeed, however, in diverting about half the Luftwaffe's fighter force to anti-bomber operations.

Pilot Lt. Kendrick R. Bragg brought the plane safely back to the desert base at Biskra Oasis, where it was repaired and flew missions until it was salvaged 6 March 1945]]
Since the airfield bombings were not appreciably reducing German fighter strength, as additional B-17 groups were formed, Eaker ordered major missions deeper into Germany against important industrial targets. The 8th Air Force then targeted the ball-bearing factories in [[Schweinfurt]], hoping to cripple the war effort there. The [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission|first attack]], on [[17 August]] [[1943]] by 230 B-17s, was met by 300 Luftwaffe fighters. Thirty-six aircraft were downed, with the loss of 200 men, but the attack did not critically damage the factories. 

A second attempt on [[14 October]] [[1943]] would later come to be known as "[[Second Raid on Schweinfurt|Black Thursday]]". <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thirdreichruins.com/schweinfurt.htm | title = Third Reich in Ruins:Schweinfurt | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | last = Walden | first = Geoff | year = 2007 | month = January | work = www.thirdreichruins.com | quote = }}</ref> Of the 291 attacking Fortresses, 59 were shot down over Germany, one ditched in the English Channel, five crashed in England, and 12 more were scrapped due to battle damage or crash-landings (more by AA guns than the Luftwaffe), a total loss of 77 B-17s. One-hundred and twenty-two bombers were damaged to some degree and needed repairs before their next flight. Out of 2900 men in the crews, about 650 men did not return, although some survived as [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s. Five were killed and 43 wounded in the damaged aircraft that made it home, and 594 were listed as Missing in Action. Only 33 bombers landed without damage. These losses could not be sustained, and the USAAF, recognizing the vulnerability of heavy bombers against interceptors, suspended daylight bomber raids deep into Germany until the development of an escort fighter that could protect the bombers all the way from the United Kingdom to Germany and back.

A third raid on Schweinfurt was attempted on [[24 February]] [[1944]] during what came to be known as "[[Big Week]]". With [[P-51 Mustang]] fighters escorting the American heavies all the way to and from the targets, only 11 of 231 B-17s were lost.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usaaf.net/chron/44/feb44.htm | title = Combat Chronology of the US Army Air Forces: February 1944 | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | last = McKillop | first = Jack | date = | work = www.usaaf.net | quote = }}</ref>  The P-51 escort reduced the loss rate to below seven percent, with only 244 of the 3,500 B-17s lost whilst taking part in the Big Week raids.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/b17_flying_fortress.htm | title = B-17 Flying Fortress | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | last = Trueman | first = Chris | date = | work = www.historylearningsite.co.uk | quote = }}</ref>

By [[27 April]] [[1945]], the rate of aircraft loss was so low that replacement aircraft were no longer arriving and the number of planes per bomb group was reduced. The Combined Bomber Offensive was effectively complete.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/apr45.htm | title = Combat Chronology of the US Army Air Forces: April 1945 | accessdate = 2007-01-17

===Pacific Theater===
Only five B-17 groups operated in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific theater]], with a peak of 168 bombers in September, 1942, and all groups converting to other types by mid-1943. While there, the [[Fifth Air Force]] B-17s were tasked with disrupting the Japanese sea lines. Air Corps doctrine dictated bombing runs from high altitude, but it was soon discovered that only one percent of their bombs hit targets. The 5th's commander, Lt. Gen. [[George Kenney]], was enthusiastic about the new technique of [[Stone skipping|skip]]-bombing<U+2014>a process in which the bombs were released at a very low altitude, causing them to strike the water's surface at a sufficiently shallow angle for them to be deflected off<U+2014>, and on [[23 October]] [[1942]], six B-17s of the 64th Squadron bombed conventionally from 10,000 feet while six 63rd Squadron bombers came in at 100 feet to skip their bombs into the sides of Japanese ships.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Frisbee | first =John L. | title =Valor:Skip-Bombing Pioneer | journal =Air Force Magazine  | volume =73 | issue =12 | pages = | publisher = | date =December 1990 | url =http://www.afa.org/magazine/valor/1290valor.asp | id = | accessdate = 2007-01-09  }}</ref>

During WWII the B-17 equipped 32 overseas combat groups, inventory peaking in August 1944 at 4,574 USAAF planes worldwide,<ref name="Baugher Squads">{{cite web |last = Baugher |first =Joe |url= http://home.att.net/~jbaugher2/b17_squad.html |title= B-17 Squadron Assignments |accessdate=2007-01-15 |format= |work= Encyclopedia of American Aircraft}}</ref> and dropped 640,036 tons of bombs on European targets (compared to 452,508 tons dropped by the Liberator and 463,544 tons dropped by all other U.S. aircraft). Approximately 4750, or one third, of B-17s built were lost in combat.<ref name="Baugher 299"/>

===Bomber defense===
[[Image:B-17formation.jpg|thumb|250px|right|B-17s of the 381st Bomb Group in [[combat box]] formation to concentrate defensive machine gun fire.]]
Before the advent of long-range [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] escorts, B-17s had only their [[.50 BMG|.50 caliber]] [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s to rely on for defense during the bombing runs over Europe. As the war intensified, Boeing used feedback from aircrews to improve each new variant with increased armament and armor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/b17.html
| title = History:B-17 Flying Fortress | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | author = | date = | work = Boeing.com | quote = }}</ref> The number of defensive guns increased from four 0.50 inch machine guns and one 0.30 inch nose machine gun in the B-17C, to 13 0.50 inch machine guns in the B-17G. But because the bombers could not [[dogfight]] with attacking fighters, and during their final bomb run they needed to be flown straight and level, individual aircraft struggled to fend off a direct attack.

A 1943 survey by the Air Corps found that over half the bombers shot down by the Germans, had left the protection of the main formation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.b17flyingfortress.de/english/index.php?id=htm/details/formation.htm | title = Formation
| accessdate = 2007-01-09 | author = | date = | work = www.b17flyingfortress.de | quote = }}</ref> To address this problem, the United States developed the bomb-group formation, which evolved into the staggered [[combat box]] formation where all the B-17s could safely cover any others in their formation with their machine guns, making a formation of the bombers a dangerous target to engage by enemy fighters.<ref>{{cite book |title= B-17 Pilot Training Manual |origdate= |url= http://www.stelzriede.com/ms/html/mshwpmn1.htm#contents |accessdate= 2007-01-16 |edition= |date= |publisher= Headquarters, AAF, Office of Flying Safety |location= |isbn= |chapter= Formation |chapterurl= http://www.stelzriede.com/ms/html/mshwpmn2.htm#form |quote= }}</ref><ref name="Fortress over Europe"/> However, the use of this rigid formation meant that individual planes could not engage in evasive manoeuvres: they had to always fly in a straight line, which made them vulnerable to the German [[88 mm gun|88 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun.  Additionally, German fighter planes later used the tactic of high-speed strafing passes rather than engaging with individual aircraft to inflict maximum damage with minimum risk.  As a result, the B-17s' loss rate was up to 25% on some early missions (60 of 291 B-17s were lost in combat on the fourth [[Raid on Schweinfurt]]<ref>{{cite book | last =Caidin | first =Martin | title =Black Thursday | publisher =E.P. Dutton & Co. Inc. | date =1960 | location =New York | pages =| url = | doi = | isbn =0-553-26729-9 | accessdate = }}</ref>), and it was not until the advent of an effective long-range fighter escort<U+2014>the [[P-51 Mustang]]<U+2014>that the B-17 became strategically potent.

The B-17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage, still reach its target and bring its crew home safely. Wally Hoffman, a B-17 Pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War II, said, "The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.storyhouse.org/wally6.html | title = We Get Our Feet Wet | accessdate = 2006-07-18 | last = Hoffman | first = Wally | date = 2006 | work = Magweb.com | quote = }}</ref>  Its toughness more than compensated for its shorter range and lighter bomb load when compared to the Consolidated [[B-24 Liberator]] or the British [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers.  Stories abound of B-17s returning to base with tails having been destroyed, with only a single engine functioning or even with large portions of wings having been damaged by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.daveswarbirds.com/b-17/| title = Battle-damaged B-17s| accessdate = 2007-01-16| date = | format = | work = | publisher = www.daveswarbirds.com | pages =}}</ref> This durability, together with the large operational numbers in the [[Eighth Air Force]] and the fame achieved by the "[[Memphis Belle (B-17)|Memphis Belle]]", made the B-17 a significant bomber aircraft of the war.
[[Image:B-17 Schweinfurt.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Formation flying through dense flak over Merseberg, Germany]]

The B-17 design went through eight major changes over the course of its production, culminating in the B-17G, differing from its immediate predecessor by the addition of a chin [[gun turret|turret]] with two [[.50 BMG|.50 caliber]] [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s under the nose. This eliminated the B-17's main defensive weakness in head-on attacks.

===The Luftwaffe===
After examining wrecked B-17s and B-24s, [[Luftwaffe]] officers discovered that at least 20 hits with [[MG 151 cannon|20 mm]] shells fired from the rear could bring them down. Pilots of average ability hit the bombers with only about two percent of the rounds they fired, so to obtain 20 hits, the average pilot had to aim one thousand 20 mm rounds at the bomber. Early versions of the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]], one of the best German interceptor fighters, were equipped with two 20 mm cannons and carried only 500 rounds. The fighter's firing-range, 400 meters, was also shorter than the B-17's 1,000 meters, and so was vulnerable while closing in through that distance. The German fighters found that when attacking from the front, where fewer defensive guns were pointed, it only took four or five hits to bring a bomber down.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Price | first =Alfred | title =Against Regensburg and Schweinfurt | journal =Air Force Magazine  | volume = 76 | issue = 9 | pages = | publisher = | date =September 1993 | url= http://www.afa.org/magazine/1993/0993against.asp | id = | accessdate =2007-01-10 }}</ref> To address the Fw 190's shortcomings, the number of cannons fitted was doubled to four with a corresponding increase in the amount of ammunition carried, and in 1944, a further upgrade to 30 mm [[MK 108 cannon|MK 108]] cannons was made, which could bring a bomber down in just a few hits. The [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] had moderate success against the B-17 late in the war. Equipped with the [[R4M rocket]], it could fire from outside the range of the bombers' .50 caliber defensive guns and bring a plane down with one hit.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBO/is_3_27/ai_111852898| title = German wonder weapons: degraded production and effectiveness| accessdate = 2007-01-16| last = Schollars| first = Todd J. | date = Fall 2003| format = | work = Air Force Journal of Logistics| publisher = }}</ref>

During World War II, after crash-landing or being forced down, approximately 40 B-17s were repaired and put back into the air by the Luftwaffe. Given German markings and codenamed "[[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] Do 200", the captured B-17s were used for clandestine spy and reconnaissance missions by the Luftwaffe<U+2014>most often used by the Luftwaffe unit known as [[KG 200]].<ref name="Do 200">{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/pentagon/2833/luftwaffe/transport/do200/do200.html | title = Dornier Do 200 | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | last = Law | first = Ricky | date = 1997 | work = Arsenal of Dictatorship | quote = }}</ref> Some B-17s kept their Allied markings and were used to infiltrate B-17 formations and report on their position and altitude. The practice was initially successful, but the Army Air Force combat aircrews quickly developed and established standard procedures to first warn off, and then fire upon  any "stranger" trying to join a group's formation.<ref name="Northstar"/>
Still other B-17s were used to determine the airplane's vulnerabilities and to train German interceptor pilots in tactics.<ref name="Goebel Oddballs">{{cite web |last = Goebel |first =Greg |url= http://www.vectorsite.net/avb17_2.html#m4 |title= Fortress Oddballs |year =2005  |accessdate=2007-01-09 |format= |work= The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|quote=}}</ref>

===Post-war history===
Following World War II, the B-17 was declared obsolete and the Army Air Force retired most of its fleet. Flight crews ferried the bombers back across the Atlantic to the United States, where the majority were melted down and sold for scrap. The [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Strategic Air Command]] had B-17 Flying Fortresses (called '''F-9'''s: for ''Fotorecon'', at first, later '''RB-17'''s) in service from 1946 through 1951. A number of B-17s still survive in museums and at airports, of which about a dozen still fly, visiting airports or performing in [[airshow]]s.  Most of these surviving examples are surplus or training aircraft, which stayed in the U.S. during World War II. However, there are a few exceptions.

Several B-17s along with other World War II bombers were converted into [[airliner]]s.  Other B-17s saw extended and valiant service as converted aerial tankers used for fighting forest fires in the western United States.<ref name="Commercial Transports">{{cite web |last = Baugher |first =Joe |url= http://home.att.net/~jbaugher2/b17_26.html |title= B-17 Commercial Transports |accessdate=2007-01-15 |format= |work= Encyclopedia of American Aircraft}}</ref>

==Operators==
{{main|List of units using the B-17 Flying Fortress}}
[[image:Living_Legends.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Over Germany, B-17 Flying Fortresses from the [[398th Bombardment Group]] fly a bombing run to [[Neumunster]], [[Germany]], on [[April 13]], [[1945]].]]

The B-17 was a versatile aircraft, serving in dozens of USAAF units in theaters of combat throughout World War II, and in non-bomber roles for the RAF. Its main use was in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], where its shorter range and smaller bombload relative to other aircraft available did not hamper it as much as in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]]. Peak USAAF inventory (in August, 1944) was 4,574 worldwide.<ref name="Baugher Squads"/>

During World War II, after crash-landing or being forced down, approximately 40 B-17s were repaired and put back into the air by the [[Luftwaffe]]. These captured aircraft were codenamed "Dornier Do 200", given German markings and used for clandestine spy and reconnaissance missions by the Luftwaffe-most often used by the Luftwaffe unit known as [[KG 200]], hence a likely possibility as a source for the "Do 200" codename.<ref name="Do 200"/>

Late in World War II, RAF and USAAF bombers that had been damaged in raids over the Reich would put down in Soviet-controlled territory rather than try to make it back to Western bases, and in April 1945 the [[Soviet Air Force]] issued a directive to its units in the field to report the location of any aircraft of its Western Allies that were in Soviet hands; among the aircraft salvaged were a total of 73 B-17s. The Fortresses that were in the best condition were returned to the USAAF, but a number were retained as interim heavy bombers. Although Russian aircrews and maintenance crews had no experience with such aircraft, the Soviets proved ingenious at keeping them flying, and in fact were delighted with the B-17's handling, comparing it to a "swallow" and the nimble [[Po-2]] biplane trainer. On the other hand, Soviet officials tended to order the "filthy pictures" applied to the aircraft removed or painted out. The B-17s remained in service until 1948, when the [[Tupolev Tu-4]] began to arrive at operational squadrons. <ref name="Goebel Oddballs"/>

When [[Israel]] achieved statehood in 1948, the [[Israeli Air Force]] had to be assembled quickly to defend the new nation from the war it found itself almost immediately embroiled in.  Among the first aircraft acquired by the Israeli Air Force were three surplus American B-17s, smuggled via [[South America]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] to avoid an arms trading ban imposed by the United States. A fourth plane was abandoned due to malfunctions and confiscated by American officials. On their delivery flight from Europe, in retaliation for [[Egypt]]ian bombing raids on [[Tel-Aviv]], the aircraft were ordered to bomb [[King Farouk]]'s Royal Palace in [[Cairo]] before continuing to Israel. They performed the mission (despite some of the crew fainting due to defective oxygen equipment), but caused little damage. The B-17s were generally unsuitable for the needs of the Israeli Air Force, and the nature of the conflict in which long-range bombing raids on large area targets were relatively unimportant<U+2014>although the psychological impact of the raids was not lost on the enemy.  The aircraft were mainly used in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], flown by [[69 Squadron IAF]]; they were withdrawn in [[1958]] after seeing minor action in the [[1956]] [[Suez Crisis]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2848/bomber1.htm#Fort | title = Israeli Air Force Bombers:Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress | accessdate = 2006-12-24 | last = Rozen | first = Owen | date = | work = The Israeli Air Force - IDF/AF | quote = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Aloni |first=Shlomo |authorlink= |year= 2006 |month= October |title= The Israeli View |journal= Aeroplane |volume= 34 |issue= 10 |pages= pp. 70-74 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

The B-17 went through several alterations in each of its design stages and variants. Of the 13 '''YB-17'''s ordered for service testing, 12 were used by the 2nd Bomb Group of Langley Field, Virginia to develop heavy bombing techniques, and the 13th was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio.<ref name="Y1B-17"/> Experiments on this plane led to the use of a turbo-supercharger, which would become standard on the B-17 line. A 14th plane, the '''Y1B-17A''', originally destined for ground testing only, was upgraded with the turbocharger. When this aircraft had finished testing, it was re-designated the '''B-17A''', and in April 1938 was the first plane to enter service under the B-17 designation.<ref name="Y1B-17"/><ref name="YB-17A"/>

As the production line developed, Boeing engineers continued to improve upon the basic design. To enhance performance at slower speeds, the '''B-17B''' was altered to include larger [[rudder]] and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]].<ref name="Baugher B-17B"/> The '''B-17C''' changed from gun blisters to flush, oval-shaped windows.<ref name="Baugher B-17C"/> Most significantly, with the '''B-17E''' version, the fuselage was extended by 10 feet, a much larger vertical fin and rudder were incorporated into the original design, a gunner's position in the tail and an improved nose were added. The engines were upgraded to more powerful versions several times, and similarly, the gun stations were altered on numerous occasions to enhance their effectiveness.<ref name="Baugher B-17E"/>
[[Image:Boeing SB-17G.jpg|250px|thumb|left|SB-17G Flying Fortress, also designated B-17H, used as a Search and Rescue aircraft. This airframe was subsequently used as a target during atomic tests at Yucca Flats in the 1950s and 1960s. The remnants are being used in the restoration of 44-85813 in Urbana, Ohio.]]

By the time the definitive '''B-17G''' appeared, the number of guns had been increased from seven to 13, the designs of the gun stations were finalized, and other adjustments were complete.

Two versions of the B-17 were flown under different designations. These were the [[XB-38 Flying Fortress|XB-38]] and the [[YB-40 Flying Fortress|YB-40]]. The '''XB-38''' was an engine test-bed for [[Allison V-1710]] liquid-cooled engines, should the Wright engines normally used on the B-17 become unavailable. The '''YB-40''' was a heavily armed modification of the standard B-17 used before the [[P-51 Mustang]], an effective long-range fighter, became available to act as escort. Additional armament included a power turret in the radio-room, a chin turret (which went on to become standard with the B-17G) and twin .50 caliber (12.7 mm) guns in the waist positions. The ammunition load was over 11,000 rounds, making the YB-40 well over 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) heavier than a fully loaded B-17F. Unfortunately, the YB-40s with their numerous heavy modifications had trouble keeping up with empty bombers, and so, together with the advent of the P-51 Mustang, the project was abandoned and finally phased out in July 1943.<ref>{{cite web |last = Baugher |first =Joe |url= http://home.att.net/~jbaugher2/b17_9.html |title= Vega XB-38 |accessdate=2007-01-15 |format= |work= Encyclopedia of American Aircraft}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Baugher |first =Joe |url= http://home.att.net/~jbaugher2/b17_12.html |title= Boeing YB-40 |accessdate=2007-01-15 |format= |work= Encyclopedia of American Aircraft}}</ref>

Late in World War II, at least 25 B-17s were fitted with radio controls, loaded with 20,000 pounds (9,000 kg) of high-explosives, dubbed "'''BQ-7''' [[Operation Aphrodite|Aphrodite]] missiles", and used against [[U-boat]] pens and bomb-resistant [[fortification]]s. Because few (if any) BQ-7s hit their target, the Aphrodite project was scrapped in early 1945.<ref>{{cite web |last = Baugher |first =Joe |url= http://home.att.net/~jbaugher2/b17_14.html |title= History of the BQ-7 |accessdate=2007-01-15 |format= |work= Encyclopedia of American Aircraft}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app1/bq-7.html | title = Boeing BQ-7 Aphrodite | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | last = Parsch

Some of these weapons included "razons" (radio-guided) glide bombs, and JB-2 Thunderbugs<U+2014>the equivalent of the German [[V-1]] Buzz Bomb. In the late 1950s, the last B-17s in United States Air Force service were '''QB-17''' drones and '''DB-17P''' drone controllers, plus a few polished '''VB-17''' squadron "hacks".

==The Fortress as a symbol==
The B-17 Flying Fortress has become, for many reasons, deserved or not, an icon of American power and a symbol of its Air Force. It  achieved a lasting fame in the general public, which has eluded most other bomber aircraft.<ref name="Johnson 2006">{{cite journal | quotes = | last = Johnson | first = Frederick A. | date = 2006 | title = The Making of an Iconic Bomber | journal = Air Force Magazine | volume = 89 | issue = 10 | pages =  | url = http://www.afa.org/magazine/Oct2006/1006bomber.asp | accessdate = 2007-01-15 |quote =  }}</ref>

During the 1930s, the USAAC, under Gen. [[Frank Maxwell Andrews]] and the Air Corps Tactical School, touted the bomber as a strategic weapon. <ref>{{cite book |last= Tate |first= Dr. James P. |title= The Army and Its Air Corps: Army Policy toward Aviation 1919-1941 |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= http://books.google.ca/books?vid=ISBN1428912576&id=pZyLTfJFaEgC&dq=The+Army+and+Its+Air+Corps+Army+Policy+toward+Aviation |accessdate= 2006-01-16 |edition= |year= 1998 |month= June |publisher= Air University Press |location= Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama  |isbn= 1428912576 |pages= 149<U+2013>150 |quote=The Howell Commission's report<U+2026>stated "<U+2026>an adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army<U+2026> }}</ref> Gen [[Henry H.

When the Model 299 was rolled out on [[28 July]] [[1935]], bristling with multiple [[machine gun]] installations, Richard Williams, a reporter for the [[The Seattle Times|''Seattle Times'']] coined the name "Flying Fortress" with his comment "Why, it's a flying fortress!".<ref name="Baugher 299"/> Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use.

After the initial B-17s were delivered to the Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group, they began sending them on promotional flights emphasizing its great range and navigational precision. In early 1938, Group commander Colonel Robert C. Olds flew a Y1B-17 from the  east to west coast. Setting a transcontinental record of 12 hours 50 minutes. He also broke the west-to-east coast record on the return trip, averaging 245 mph in 10 hours 46 minutes. Six planes of the 2nd Bombardment group took off from Langley AFB on February 15, 1938 as part of a good will flight to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]. Covering 12,000 miles they returned on February 27.<ref name="Baugher Y1B-17"/> In a well publicized mission, three B-17s, "intercepted" and took photographs of the Italian ocean liner ''[[SS Rex|Rex]]'' 800 miles off the Atlantic coast.<ref name="USAF Rex"/>

The Flying Fortress found a place in the public mind as well. In 1943, [[Consolidated Aircraft]] commissioned a poll to see <U+201C>to what degree the public is familiar with the names of the Liberator and the Flying Fortress.<U+201D> Of 2,500 men in cities where Consolidated ads had been run in newspapers, only 73 percent had heard of the Liberator, while 90 percent knew of the B-17.<ref name="Johnson 2006"/>

[[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] featured the airplane in its movies, such as ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'', with [[Gregory Peck]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041996/ |title= Twelve O'Clock High (1949)|accessdate=2007-01-16 |format= |work= Internet Movie Database.}}</ref> This film was made with the full cooperation of the [[United States Air Force]] and made use of actual combat footage. In 1964 the movie was made into a television show of the [[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|same name]], and ran for three years. The B-17 also appeared in the 1938 movie ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Spencer Tracy]].

During the war, the largest offensive bombing force, the [[Eighth Air Force]], was run by officers who openly preferred the B-17.  Lt. Gen. [[Jimmy Doolittle]] wrote about his preference for equipping the Eighth with B-17s. Citing the logistical advantage in keeping fielded forces down to a minimum number of aircraft types with their unique servicing and spares, he wanted B-17 bombers and P-51 fighters for the Eighth. His views were supported by Eighth Air Force statisticians, whose studies purportedly showed that Fortresses had utility and survivability much greater than that of the B-24.<ref name="Johnson 2006"/>

The most famous B-17, the [[Memphis Belle (B-17)|Memphis Belle]], toured the U.S. with its crew to reinforce national morale (and to sell [[War Bonds]]), and starred in a USAAF documentary, ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036152/ |title= The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944)|accessdate=2007-01-16 |format= |work= Internet Movie Database.}}</ref>

After the war ended, most B-17s were scrapped, but the U.S. Air Force did keep some B-17s for VIP transports and drone directors. The Navy and Coast Guard obtained a few B-17s for over-water patrols well into the postwar years. These surviving planes, and the status of the Flying Fortress prompted many people and organizations around the world to protect or rebuild planes, some of which are still flying.<ref name="Johnson 2006"/>

The "[[Memphis Belle (B-17)|Memphis Belle]]", which flew 25 missions over Europe before touring the United States to advertise [[war bonds]], was preserved in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] from 1948 to 2003, and then transported to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in October 2005 for restoration and eventual display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] located there.  The restoration is expected to take eight to ten years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/questions/topic.asp?id=510 | title = FAQ Memphis Belle | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | work = www.nationalmuseum.af.mil | quote = }}</ref>

"The Swoose", the only surviving example of the narrow-tailed B-17s of the A, B, C and D series, flew combat missions in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] before being converted to an unarmed transport/flying command-post used in Australia by Lt. Gen. [[George Brett (military)|George Brett]], commander of Allied air forces in the [[South West Pacific Area]].  It returned to the United States with Brett in 1943, and is the oldest surviving B-17 in the world. "The Swoose" is presently in storage at the Smithsonian Institution's Silver Hill ("Paul E. Garber" Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland) where, as of 2000, plans have been made to restore her.  Col. [[Frank Kurtz]], commanding officer of the 463rd Bombardment Group at the Celone Airbase near Foggia,Italy, and the father of actress [[Swoosie Kurtz]] (b. [[6 September]] [[1944]]), carried the Swoose name forward from the original Swoose (which he flew in the Pacific prior to being named [[Officer (armed forces)|CO]] of the 463rd), naming the B-17G he flew with the 463rd "Swoose II".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.463rd.com/swoose.htm | title = The Swoose | accessdate = 2006-12-18 | last = | first = | date = | work = 463rd Bombardment Group Historical Society | quote = }}</ref>  The 463rd BG was thereafter known as the "The Swoose Group".

"Shoo Shoo Baby" (later "Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby") flew 24 combat missions from England with the [[91st Bomb Group]] from March 1944 until  being forced to land in Sweden in May 1944. Being neutral, Sweden interned the crew, and about the same time a deal was made between the Swedish and U.S. governments to allow around 300 American crewmen to return in exchange for nine B-17Fs and Gs that had landed intact in Sweden.  Seven of these were converted by [[Saab]] Aircraft into airliners that could carry 14 passengers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2481 | title = Boeing B-17G <U+201C>Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby<U+201D> | accessdate = 2007-01-09 | date = | work = National Museum of the USAF | quote = }}</ref> "Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby" flew for SILA (now [[Scandinavian Airlines]]). In December 1945, it was one of two B-17s sold to the Danish Air Lines (DDL), until June 1947. The B-17 was subsequently transferred in March 1948 to the Danish Army Air Corps, her nickname was "Store Bj<U+00F8>rn", and in December 1949, to the [[Danish Navy]].  Then, from October 1952, to the Royal [[Danish Air Force]] as ESK-721; finally retiring a year later. [[Image:ShooShoo.jpg|thumb|250px|left|"Shoo Shoo Shoo Baby" at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.]] After two years in storage, she was sold as F-BGSP to the [[Institut G<U+00E9>ographique National]], a French [[aerial mapping]] company based in [[Creil]] outside Paris.  Last flown in July 1961, the remains of the plane were donated to the [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1972.  A restoration was undertaken between 1978<U+2013>1988 at [[Dover Air Force Base]], [[Delaware]] and the aircraft can be seen today at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton]], [[Ohio]]. The name was restored to "Shoo Shoo Baby" and, due to the amount of skin work required to restore its wartime appearance, it is finished in olive drab and grey, instead of bare-metal as it was in operations. When the "Memphis Belle" restoration is complete, it will replace "Shoo Shoo Baby" as the museum's B-17 exhibit.

As part of [[Operation Bolero]], on [[15 July]] [[1942]], two B-17s navigating and acting as mother ships, along with six [[P-38 Lightning]]s, were forced to land on a glacier in [[Greenland]] during a ferry flight to the [[United Kingdom]].  None of the crews were lost, but by the 1990s, these eight aircraft had been buried under more than 250 feet of ice.  Although the recovery effort located the lead B-17 to find it crushed, one of the P-38s was subsequently recovered and restored as "Glacier Girl".<ref>{{cite book |last= Hayes |first= David |title= The Lost Squadron |url= http://www.thelostsquadron.com/p-38-pages/p-38-lightning-history.htm  |accessdate= 2007-01-16 |year= 1994 |month= November |publisher= Hyperion Books |location= |isbn= 0786860480 |quote= }}</ref>

The "Nine-O-Nine" (42-31909), of the 91st Bomb Group, 323rd Bomb Squadron, completed 140 missions without an abort or loss of a crewman.

She had 21 engine changes, four wing panel changes, 15 main gas tank changes, and 18 Tokyo tank changes (long-range fuel tanks). M/Sgt. Rollin L.
