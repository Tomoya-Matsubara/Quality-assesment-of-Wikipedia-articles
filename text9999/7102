'''Toorak Gardens''' is an inner eastern [[List of Adelaide suburbs|suburb]] of [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. It is located 2&nbsp;km east of the [[Adelaide city centre]]. Toorak Gardens is a leafy, tree-lined and wealthy inner suburb containing a number of historical and contemporary attractions. First Creek, part of the [[River Torrens|Torrens catchment]], runs through the north-east corner of the suburb. Toorak Gardens is in the [[Local Government Areas in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Burnside]], and is bounded to the north by [[Kensington Road, Adelaide|Kensington Road]], to the east by [[Portrush Road, Adelaide|Portrush Road]], to the south by [[Greenhill Road, Adelaide|Greenhill Road]] and to the west by Prescott Terrace and Warwick Avenue.<ref>[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=toorak+gardens+SA,+Australia&ie=UTF8&ll=-34.929712,138.638449&spn=0.030892,0.054417&z=14&om=1 Toorak Gardens] on Google Maps, Accessed 7/6/7</ref>

Originally farmland owned by the Fergusson and Prescott families in the 19th century, it was subdivided and gained popularity in 1920s. It contains the [[Burnside War Memorial Hospital]]; converted from a grand mansion in 1949, it remains Burnside's only local community hospital.

==History==
Possibilities for derivation of the name ''Toorak'' are ''Torrak'', an aboriginal word meaning ''tea-tree springs'', ''toora'' an Aboriginal word for ''[[coot]]'' or ''[[malleefowl]]''{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and other aboriginal words of similar pronunciation meaning reedy swamp and black crow.<ref>[http://localhero.biz/article/permatitle/history_of_toorak,_victoria/ History of Toorak, Victoria], localhero.biz</ref>  Today's suburb of Toorak Gardens is composed of parts of the Adelaide sections of 275 (Toorak) and 274 (Monreith Farm). Section 274 was bounded by (in clockwise order) Swaine Avenue, Portrush Road, Greenhill Road and Fullarton Road. Section 275 was bounded by Kensington Road, Portrush Road, Swaine Avenue and Prescott Terrace. The suburb of Toorak was first developed in 1912, largely on land that had previously been the eastern half of the Prescott Farm. Before its development into a village, it had been farmland up until that point with little settlement apart from the Prescott's home and worksheds as well as two large and extravagant houses. [[Image:Prescott home.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Prescott Family Home]]Julia Hallett owned a spectacular mansion on Portrush Road (now located at No. 15) while Benjamin Burford had a grand mansion on Kensington Road that he named Attunga. When the suburb was first planned, laid-out and named there were many objections, primarily because of the association with the elite Melbourne suburb of [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]] (which remains wealthy and upper-class to this day). The real-estate agents assigned to the suburb received many complaints due to this association, including one signed 'No Snobbery'. Extensive building restrictions were placed on development in the early suburb. After the first houses had been built, the Adelaide Mail reported on 18 May 1912:

{{quote|"...only one house is allowed on each block, to cost not less than <U+00A3>600. Wood was naturally tabooed, the materials being set down as either brick, stone or reinforced concrete, with slate, iron or tile roofs. Nearly all the houses are being roofed with Marseilles tiles, giving a pleasant appearance to the suburb which is springing up there... where superior homes can be built of bought without fear of getting undesirable surroundings."}}

Toorak received considerable attention from real-estate businesses, the press and the community at large. The Adelaide papers paid particular notice to the suburb's developments, announcing council work on the suburb's paths and gardens. In 1912 when trees were planted on Grant and Alexandra avenues, in 1914 when flower strips were developed on the kerbs, in 1916 when a reserve was created on Giles Street; they were all quickly reported. The Toorak Bowling club was also developed in this era, it stands to this day.

[[Image:Attunga.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Attunga property being inspected by the Burnside Council in 1944]]
Section 274 was bought by a Scotish family, the Fergussons. It was purchased along with property at Knoxville (today's suburbs of [[Glenunga, South Australia|Glenunga]] and [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]]) and named by the family. They had come from the village of Monreith in Wigtown County, [[Scotland]] and gave that name to their new farm. The Monreith farm was steadily developed by the family, but with the death of Alexander Fergusson in 1869, the property passed into the hands of his widow, Agnes. She sold off parts of the farm in 1883 for <U+00A3>15,000, and the remainder in 1917 for <U+00A3>20,000. Before the farm was sold, the Fergussons had established a [[flour mill]], horse stabling and were engaging in business ventures in various parts of the state. It was in 1917<ref>[http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/manning/pn/t/t4.htm The Manning Index of South Australian History], www.slsa.sa.gov.au</ref> that Monreith was given its modern name of Toorak Gardens. [[Real estate developer|Developer]]s started subdividing the new suburb on much the same lines as Toorak had been, with similar building restrictions and much media attention. The original Fergusson family home was demolished in 1923 and the family settled in separate houses on Cudmore Avenue. Miss Ivy Laver, a successful local businesswoman, was responsible for building the main park of Toorak Gardens, Fergusson Square. It remains as a monument to those who first settled the area.

Benjamin Burford's Attunga property contained the largest and most extravagant mansion built in the suburb, and with his passing it was bought in 1905 by an investor from Broken Hill, Otto George Ludwig von Rieben. While maintaining and paying particular attention to the property, von Rieben eventually settled on a property in the [[Adelaide Hills]]. Attunga however, almost forty years after he gained it, was offered to the Burnside Council free of charge in 1944 for use as a hospital. The Council had first suggested building a community hospital in August 1943, as part of its Post-War Reconstruction and Development Plan; it was to cost <U+00A3>100,000, and was to remain as a memorial to honour Burnside's war dead. In April 1949 the first conversion of von Rieben's home was complete, and the hospital was caring for 21 patients. The hospital closed for a month in 1956; when it reopened it was given its present name: The [[Burnside War Memorial Hospital]]. By then it had cared for over 1,400 patients.

==Geography==
[[Image:Toorak Gardens Street.jpg|left|240px|thumb|Tree lined street in Toorak Gardens]]
Toorak Gardens has an area of 1.11&nbsp;km<U+00B2> with a population density of 2,332/km<U+00B2>.<ref>[http://www.id.com.au/burnside/commprofile/default.asp?id=139&gid=220&pg=1 City of Burnside: Community Profile] ''Introduction and Summary'', Accessed 13/6/7</ref> Situated on the [[Adelaide Plains]] at an average elevation of 80 metres above sea level and a kilometre east of the [[Adelaide Parklands|parklands]], the suburb is rectangular shaped and wholly urbanised. There is only one notable park, Fergusson Square; the only other open space is provided by the Toorak Bowling Club.

Prior to European settlement, the area was heavily forested. Blue Gum and River Gum trees grew on the floodplains around First and Second creeks. Grey box woodlands, known to early settlers as the 'black forest', grew around and south of Greenhill Road. Native Australia flora and fauna inhabited the plains.

With the advent of colonisation, much of the forest was cleared and replaced by farmland, on which wheat and barley were grown.<ref>[http://www.burnside.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=796 City of Burnside: Native Vegetation] Accessed 13/6/7</ref> First Creek provided a reliable source of water, and crops flourished. In the late 19th century, the area that today comprises Toorak Gardens was almost completely free of native vegetation. When the land was sold and subdivided, with streets beginning to run through it, lush gardens were grown. The new wealthy white inhabitants, both of their own preference, and under duty from the land deed, put much effort into the suburb's greenery.

==Residents==
[[Image:Toorak foreign.GIF|right|240px|thumb|Percentages of the fifth of the population born abroad]]
According to the 2001 Census, the population of the Toorak Gardens census area was 2,595 and  stable, with only a minor decrease in population between the 1996 and 2001 censuses. 55.0% of the population was [[female]], 80.3% were Australian born and over 92% of residents were Australian [[citizens]].<ref>[http://www.id.com.au/burnside/commprofile/default.asp?id=139&gid=220&pg=1 City of Burnside: Community Profile] ''Toorak Gardens'', Accessed 7/6/7</ref>

The suburb contains a relatively large stable family population, mainly composed of older parents with their either teenage or young adult children. There is also a relatively large number of 'empty nesters' (older parents in their fifties whose children have left home) and [[retirees]] over 70.<ref>[http://www.id.com.au/burnside/commprofile/default.asp?id=139&gid=220&pg=2 City of Burnside: Community Profile] ''How old are we?'' 13/6/7</ref> Toorak Gardens contains a relatively high proportion of residents who live in flats or apartments (28.4%), but the majority still live in separate houses (64.7%).<ref>[http://www.id.com.au/burnside/commprofile/default.asp?id=139&gid=220&pg=20 City of Burnside: Community Profile] ''What type of dwelling do we live in?'' Accessed 13/6/7</ref>

Residents have a slightly higher than average [[religious]] affiliation (72%), with the vast majority of these being [[Christian]] (70.3%). The top ten religions (in descending order) were: [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Uniting Church|Uniting]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], [[Lutheran]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Baptist]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Salvation Army]].<ref>[http://www.id.com.au/burnside/commprofile/default.asp?id=139&gid=220&pg=6 City of Burnside: Community Profile] ''What is our religion?'' Accessed 13/6/7</ref>

Toorak Gardens has an exceptionally educated population, with over 40% holding a degree or diploma.<ref>[http://www.id.com.au/burnside/commprofile/default.asp?id=139&gid=220&pg=8 City of Burnside: Community Profile] ''What are our qualifications?'' Accessed 13/6/7</ref> This level of education attainment is reflected in the suburb's employment patterns: the most popular industries for employment were: education, health and community services (27.9%); and finance, insurance and business services (25.2%).<ref>[http://www.id.com.au/burnside/commprofile/default.asp?id=139&gid=220&pg=12 City of Burnside: Community Profile] ''What industries do we work in?''

==Attractions==
[[Image:Burnside war memorial hospi.jpg|left|thumb|240px|The Burnside War Memorial Hospital from [[Kensington Road, Adelaide|Kensington Road]].]]While Toorak Gardens is a small mainly residential suburb, there are several attractions of note. The only shopping inside the suburb is at the Greenhill Rd / Portrush Rd corner, where there is a small precinct of shops. This is popular because of its close proximity to [[Burnside Village]] (i.e. Burnide village is in the other side of Greenhill Road). One of the more interesting places is the Trak Cinema - this is a small cinema which is well known for its [[Art film|arthouse]] screenings, but it also shows popular releases. A restaurant, Grimaldi's, is situated in the same group of shops and is popular with locals and visitors.

The only park in the suburb is Fergusson Square (named after the Fergusson family), which was developed by Mrs Ivy Laver shortly after World War I.<ref>[http://www.burnside.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/fnames.doc ''City of Burnside - Street Names and Origins''], Accessed 2006-02-20.</ref>

The [[Anglican Church of St Theodore]] is located on the corner of Prescott Terrace and Swaine Avenue.  It was originally established in what is now the [[Rose Park Primary School]], and then moved to the current site. The Toorak Burnside Bowling Club Inc, surrounded on three sides by Grant Ave, Alexandra Ave and Giles St, has two greens and up to four weekly competitions.<ref>[http://www.toorakburnsidebowls.com.au/index.html Toorak Burnside Bowling Club], Accessed 14/1/07</ref> The not-for-profit [[Burnside War Memorial Hospital]] is located in the north-east of the suburb and is the only community hospital in the [[City of Burnside]]. This hospital started operation in 1949 with 21 patients, in a local house offered for the purpose by Otto George Ludwig von Rieben.
