'''Zhao Hongyin''' (<U+8D99><U+5F18><U+6BB7>) (d. 956) was a military general in [[history of China|imperial China]]'s [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].

After his death, his son [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Zhao Kuangyin]] founded the [[Song Dynasty]] in 960. Another son [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Zhao Kuangyi]] would also become a Song [[emperor of China|emperor]]. For this reason Zhao Hongyin is posthumously honored as Emperor Xuanzu (<U+5BA3><U+7956>) of Song.

==Early life==
The young Zhao Hongyin was a skilled [[horse archery|horse archer]]. He originally served the warlord [[Wang Rong]] for the [[de facto]] independent [[Zhao (Five Dynasties)|Zhao]] State, and was once ordered by Wang to lead 500 cavalries to assist their ally [[Li Cunxu]] in battles, presumably against the [[Later Liang Dynasty]]. Impressed by his bravery, Li kept Zhao as part of his imperial army after the fall of Zhao in 921.<ref name=ss1>{{harvnb|''Song Shi''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%AE%8B%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B7001 vol. 1]}}</ref>

It was also around this period that he married Lady Du, 3 years his junior.<ref>{{harvnb|''Song Shi''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%AE%8B%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B7242 vol. 242]}} mentions that the marriage took place when Lady Du, born around 902, was just entering adulthood.</ref> According to rumors popular a few decades after his death, when Zhao Hongyin first came to the area by himself, he encountered a snowstorm and had to beg for food from servants in official Du Shuang's (<U+675C><U+723D>) house. After a few days, the servants noticed him hardworking and persuaded Du in keeping him in the house. A few months later, the family arranged for him to marry their eldest daughter.<ref name=dqjs1>{{harvnb|''Dong Qi Jishi''|loc=[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%9D%B1%E9%BD%8B%E8%A8%98%E4%BA%8B/%E5%8D%B7%E4%B8%80 vol. 1]}}</ref>
