The '''Brothers Grimm''' were [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], [[Germany|German]] [[professor]]s who were best known for publishing collections of [[folk tale]]s and [[fairy tale]]s,<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World,'' New York, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1988; Palgrave MacMillan, 2002.</ref> and for their work in linguistics, relating to how the sounds in words shift over time ([[Grimm's Law]]).	 
	 
==Biography==	 
Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm and Wilhelm Karl Grimm were born in [[1785]] and [[1786]], respectively, in [[Hanau]] near Frankfurt in [[Hesse]]. They were among the six children of a senior clerk (Amtmann);  their early childhood was spent in the countryside, in what has been described as an "idyllic" state. When the eldest brother Jacob was eleven years old, however, their father died, and the family moved into a cramped urban residence. Two years later, the children's grandfather also died, leaving the children and their mother to struggle in reduced circumstances. (Modern psychologists have argued that this harsh family background influenced the ways the Brothers Grimm would interpret and present their tales. The Brothers tended to idealize and excuse fathers, leaving a predominance of female villains in the tales&mdash;the infamous evil stepmothers.) <ref>Ian Alister and Christopher Hauke, eds., ''Contemporary Jungian Analysis,'' London, Routledge, 1998</font color>; pp. 216-19.</ref> Another influence is perhaps shown in the Grimms' fondness for stories such as ''[[The Twelve Brothers]]'', which show ''one'' sister and ''several'' brothers (their own family structure) overcoming opposition.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 37 ISBN 0-393-05848-4</ref>

The two brothers were educated at the Friedrichs-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Kassel]] and later both read law at the [[University of Marburg]]. They were in their early twenties when they began the linguistic and philological studies that would culminate in both [[Grimm's Law]] and their collected editions of fairy and folk tales. Though their collections of tales became immensely popular, they were essentially a byproduct of the linguistic research which was the Brothers' primary goal. 

In 1830, they formed a household in [[G<U+00F6>ttingen]] where they were to become professors.

In 1837, the Brothers Grimm joined five of their colleague professors at the [[University of G<U+00F6>ttingen]] to protest against the abolition of the liberal [[constitution]] of the state of [[Hanover]] by King [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover]] a reactionary son of [[George III of England]]. This group came to be known in the [[Germany|German]] states as ''Die G<U+00F6>ttinger Sieben'' (''The G<U+00F6>ttingen Seven''). The two, along with the five others, protested against the abrogation. For this, the professors were fired from their university posts and some even deported--including Jakob. Jakob settled in Kassel, outside Ernst's realm, and Wilhelm joined him there, both staying with their brother Ludwig.  However, the next year, the two were invited to Berlin by the King of Prussia, and both settled there.<ref>[http://www.diebruedergrimm.de/texte/seiten/ebiogrimm.htm Die Brueder Grimm Timeline] at DieBruederGrimm.de, retrieved [[February 4]], [[2007]]</ref>

Wilhelm died in 1859; his elder brother Jacob died in 1863. They are buried in the St. Matth<U+00E4>us Kirchhof Cemetery in [[Sch<U+00F6>neberg]], [[Berlin]]. The Grimms helped foment a nationwide democratic public opinion in [[Germany]] and are cherished as the progenitors of the German democratic movement, whose [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]]/1849 was crushed brutally by the Kingdom of [[Prussia]], where there was established a [[constitutional monarchy]].

==The ''Tales''==
{{mainarticle|Grimm's Fairy Tales}}
The Brothers Grimm began collecting folk tales<ref>James M. McGlathery, ed., ''The Brothers Grimm and Folktale,'' Champaigne, University of Illinois Press, 1988.</ref> around 1807, in response to a wave of awakened interest in German folklore that followed the publication of [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]]'s folksong collection ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' ("The Boy's Magic Horn"), 1805-8. By 1810 the Grimms produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, which they had recorded by inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard.  Although it is often believed that they took their tales from peasants, many of their informants were middle-class or aristocratic, recounting tales they had heard from their servants, and several of the informants were of [[Huguenot]] ancestry and told tales French in origin.<ref>[[Jack Zipes]], ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p 69-70 ISBN 0-415-92151-1</ref>

In 1812, the Brothers published a collection of 86 German fairy tales in a volume titled ''Kinder- und Hausm<U+00E4>rchen'' ([[Grimm's Fairy Tales|"Children's and Household Tales"]]). They published a second volume of 70 stories in 1814 ("1815" on the title page), which together make up the first edition of the collection, containing 156 stories. A second edition followed in 1819-22, expanded to 170 tales. Five more editions were issued during the Grimms' lifetimes,<ref>Two volumes of the second edition were published in 1819, with a third volume in 1822. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. All were of two volumes, except for the three-volume second edition. Donald R. Hettinga, ''The Brothers Grimm: Two Lives, One Legacy,'' New York, Clarion Books, 2001; p. 154.</ref> in which stories were added or subtracted, until the seventh edition of 1857 contained 211 tales.  Many of the changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly those that objected that not all the tales were suitable for children, despite the title.<ref>[[Maria Tatar]], ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 15-17, ISBN 0-691-06722-8</ref>  They were also criticized for being insufficiently ''German''; this not only affected the tales they included, but their language as they changed "Fee" (fairy) to an enchantress or wise woman, every prince to a king's son, every princess to a king's daughter.<ref>[[Maria Tatar]], ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31, ISBN 0-691-06722-8</ref> (It has long been recognized that some of these later-added stories were derived from printed rather than oral sources.) <ref>Kathleen Kuiper, ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature,'' Springfield, MA, Merriam-Webster, 1995, p. 494; Valerie Paradiz, ''Clever Maids: The Secret History of the Grimm Fairy Tales,'' New York, Basic Books, 2005, p. xii. One example: the tale "All Fur," ''Allerleirauh,'' in the 1857 collection derives from Carl Nehrlich's 1798 novel ''Schilly.'' Laura Gonzenbach, ''Beautiful Angiola: The Great Treasury of Sicilian Folk and Fairy Tales,'' London, Routledge, 2003; p. 345.</ref> 

These editions, equipped with scholarly notes, were intended as serious works of folklore. The Brothers also published the ''Kleine Ausgabe'' or "small edition," containing a selection of 50 stories expressly designed for children (as opposed to the more formal ''Gro<U+00DF>e Ausgabe'' or "large edition"). Ten printings of the "small edition" were issued between 1825 and 1858.

The Grimms were not the first to publish collections of folktales. The 1697 French collection by [[Charles Perrault]] is the most famous, though there were various others, including a German collection by Johann Karl August Mus<U+00E4>us published in 1782-7. The earlier collections, however, made little pretense to strict fidelity to sources. The Brothers Grimm were the first workers in this genre to present their stories as faithful renditions of the kind of direct folkloric materials that underlay the sophistications of an adapter like Perrault. In so doing, the Grimms took a basic and essential step toward modern [[folklore]] studies, leading to the work of [[folklorists]] like [[Peter and Iona Opie]]<ref>Peter and Iona Opie, ''The Classic Fairy Tales,'' London, Oxford University Press, 1974, is the most famous of their many works in the field.</ref> and others.

A century and a half after the Grimms began publishing, however, a sweeping, skeptical, and highly critical re-assessment disproved the Grimms' basic claims about their work.<ref>John M. Ellis, ''One Fairy Story Too Many: The Brothers Grimm and Their Tales,'' Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1983.</ref> The Brothers did not in fact use exclusively German sources for their collection; far from maintaining fidelity to those sources, they rewrote and revised and adapted their stories, just as Perrault and their other predecessors had done. The different printed versions of the tales display the latter fact; the 1810 manuscripts, published in 1924, 1927, and 1974, accentuate the Brothers' consistent habit of changing and adapting their original materials. The irony is that the Brothers Grimm helped create a serious scholarly discipline that they themselves never practiced.

It should be noted that the Grimms' method was common in their historical era. Arnim and Brentano edited and adapted the folksongs of ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn;'' in the early 1800s Brentano collected folktales in much the same way as the Grimms.<ref>Ellis, ''One Fairy Story too Many,'' pp. 2-7.</ref> The good academic practices violated by these early researchers had not yet been codified in the period in which they worked. The Grimms have been criticized for a basic dishonesty, for making false claims about their fidelity&mdash;for saying one thing and doing another;<ref>Ellis, pp. 37 ff.</ref> whether and to what degree they were deceitful, or self-deluding, is perhaps an open question.

==Linguistics==
In the very early 19th century, the time in which the Brothers Grimm lived, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] had just met its fate, and [[Germany]] as we know it today did not yet exist; it was basically an [[German Confederacy|area of hundreds of principalities and small or mid-sized countries]].  The major unifying factor for the German people of the time was a common language.  So part of what motivated the Brothers in their writings and in their lives was the desire to help create a German identity. 

Less well known to the general public outside Germany is the Brothers' work on a German dictionary, the ''[[Deutsches W<U+00F6>rterbuch]]''. Indeed, the ''Deutsches W<U+00F6>rterbuch'' was the first major step in creating a standardized "modern" German language since [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther's translation of the Bible]] to German; being very extensive (33 volumes, weighing 84 kg) it is still considered the standard reference for German [[etymology]].  

The brother Jacob is recognized for enunciating [[Grimm's law]], Germanic Sound Shift, that was first observed by the Danish philologist [[Rasmus Christian Rask]]. Grimm's law was the first non-trivial systematic [[sound change]] ever to be discovered.

==Miscellaneous==
[[Image:1000-DEM-OBV-178x83.jpg|150px|thumb|The Brothers Grimm on a 1000 [[German Mark|DM]] banknote.]]

Between 1990 and the 2002 introduction of the [[euro]] currency in Germany, the Grimms were depicted on the 1000 [[Deutsche Mark]] note<U+2014>the largest available denomination.

The 1962 film [[The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm]] shows a fictionalized account of the conflict in the brothers' lives between their tale collecting and their philological work, as well as dramatizing three tales.

2005 found the brothers portrayed in the [[Terry Gilliam]] movie [[The Brothers Grimm]] starring [[Matt Damon]] and [[Heath Ledger]].
