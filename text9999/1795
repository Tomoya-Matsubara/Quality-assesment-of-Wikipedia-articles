==Biography==
Molv<U+00E6>r was born and raised on the island of [[Sula, M<U+00F8>re og Romsdal]], [[Norway]], and left at age nineteen to study on the Jazz program at [[Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet|Trondheim Musikkonservatorium]] (1980-82).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnu.no/jazzlinja25/studentene.htm |title=Jazzlinja NRNU.no |publisher=NTNU.no |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> He joined the bands [[Jazzpunkensemblet]] with [[Jon Eberson]] and [[Masqualero]], alongside [[Arild Andersen]], [[Jon Christensen]] and [[Tore Brunborg]]. [[Masqualero]] (named after a [[Wayne Shorter]] composition originally recorded by [[Miles Davis]]) recorded several albums for [[ECM Records]], and Molv<U+00E6>r recorded with other ECM artists before his 1997 debut solo album, ''Khmer''. The record was a fusion of [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]], electronic soundscapes, and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop beats]] <U+2013> and quite unlike the delicate "chamber jazz" typically associated with ECM.<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/10bestcds/story/0,12102,1261055,00.html Geoff Dyer in The Observer]</ref>  Molv<U+00E6>r's muted trumpet sound, sometimes electronically processed, had an obvious debt to Miles Davis's work of the 1970s and 1980s, but without being a slavish copy.  For the first time, [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] released singles - "Song of Sand", backed with three remixes, and "Ligotage". In 2000, a second album followed, ''Solid Ether'', after which Molv<U+00E6>r left [[ECM (record label)|ECM]]. He has recorded several albums since, and has also produced film and theater music.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=mic1/>

He often works with guitarist [[Eivind Aarset]]. He has also played with Tabla Beat Science created by [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]] and [[Bill Laswell]].<ref name=mic2/>
