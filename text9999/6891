'''Dur-Sharrukin''' ("Fortress of Sargon"), present day '''Khorsabad''', was the [[Assyria]]n capital in the time of [[Sargon II of Assyria]]. Khorsabad is a village in northern [[Iraq]], 15&nbsp;km northeast of [[Mosul]], which is still today inhabited by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The great city was entirely built in the decade preceding 706 BC. After the unexpected death of Sargon, the capital was shifted 20&nbsp;km south to [[Nineveh]]. 


==History==
Sargon II ruled from 722-705 BCE. In 717, Sargon ordered the construction of a new palace-city at the foot of the [[Gebel Musri]], just at the confluence of the [[Tigris]] and the [[Great Zab|Greater Zab]] rivers. The demands for timber and other materials and craftsmen, who came from as far as coastal [[Phoenicia]], are documented in contemporary Assyrian letters. The debts of construction workers were nullified in order to attract a sufficient labour force. The land in the environs of the town was taken under cultivation, and [[olive]] groves were planted to increase Assyria's deficient oil-production.  The great city was entirely built in the decade preceding 706 BC; after the unexpected death of Sargon, the capital was shifted 20&nbsp;km south to [[Nineveh]]. 

The court moved to Dur-Sharrukin in [[706 BC]], although it was not completely finished yet. Sargon was killed during a battle in 705. His son and successor [[Sennacherib]] abandoned the project, and relocated the capital with its administration to the city of [[Nineveh]]. The city was never completed and was finally abandoned a century later when the Assyrian empire fell. <ref> ''Mesopotamia: The Mighty Kings''.</ref>

The town was of rectangular layout and measured 1760 * 1635 m. The enclosed area comprised 3 square kilometres, or 700 acres. The length of the walls was 16280 Assyrian units, which corresponded to the numerical value of Sargon's name. The city walls were massive and 157 towers protected its sides. Seven gates entered the city from all directions. A walled terrace contained temples and the royal palace. The main temples were dedicated to the gods [[Nabu]], [[Shamash]] and [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], while [[Adad]], [[Ningal]] and [[Ninurta]] had smaller shrines. A temple tower, [[ziqqurat]], was also constructed. The palace was adorned with sculptures and wall reliefs, and the gates were flanked with winged bulls [[shedu]] statues weighing up to 40 tons. Sargon supposedly lost at least one of these winged bulls in the river.

In addition to the great city, there was a royal hunting park and a garden that included "all the aromatic plants of Hatti<ref>''Hatti'': in this context, all the areas to the west of the Euphrates controlled by [[Neo-Hittite]] kingdoms.</ref> and the fruit-trees of every mountain", a "record of power and conquest", as [[Robin Lane Fox]] has observed.<ref>D.D. Luckenbill, ''Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia'', vol II:242, quoted in Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'' 2008, pp26f.</ref> Surviving correspondence mentions the moving of thousands of young fruit trees, [[quince]]s, [[almond]]s, [[apple]]s and [[medlar]]s.<ref>Lane Fox 2008:27; texts are in Luckenbill 1927:II.</ref> 
<blockquote>"On the central canal of Sargon's garden stood a pillared pleasure-pavilion which looked up to a great topographic creation: a man-made Garden Mound. This Mound was planted with [[cedar]]s and [[cypress]]es and was modelled after a foreign landscape, the [[Nur Mountains|Amanus mountains]] in north Syria, which had so amazed the Assyrian kings. In their flat palace-gardens they built a replica of what they had encountered."<ref>Lane Fox 2008:27, noting D. Stronach, "The Garden as a political statement: some case-studies from the Near East in the first millennium BC", ''Bulletin of the Asia Institute'' '''4''' (1990:171-80). The garden mount first documented at Dur-Sharrukin was to have a long career in the [[history of gardening]].</ref></blockquote>

==Archaeology ==
The site was first noticed by the French consul at [[Mosul]], [[Paul-<U+00C9>mile Botta]] in 1843; Botta believed however that Khorsabad was the site of biblical [[Nineveh]]. The site was excavated in 1842-44 as well as in 1852-55, and artifacts from these excavations were brought to the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] after the discovery.

The site of Khorsabad was excavated 1928-1935 by American archaeologists from the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] in [[Chicago]]. The primary discoveries from Khorsabad are within the study of Assyrian art and architecture. Few other objects from the short-lived city were discovered.

=== Relocation of the Bulls ===

Paul Emile Botta and Victor Place attempted to move two 30-ton colossi to Paris from Khorsabad in 1853. In order to facilitate their shipment to Paris they were sawn in pieces, and the team still ran into problems. One of them fell into the Tigris, never to be retrieved. The other made it to Paris. A plaster replica was made to replace the lost one in 1957. <ref> ''Mesopotamia: The Mighty Kings'' pp 112-113, 120-121.</ref>

In 1928 Eward Chiera unearthed a colossal bull estimated to weigh 40 tons in Khorsabad. This was found split into three large fragments. The torso alone weighed about 20 tons. This was shipped to Chicago. It was too big to fit through some railroad tunnels and had to be rerouted from New York to Chicago via New Orleans. <ref>''Mesopotamia: The Mighty Kings'' pp 118-119 </ref>

Descriptions of how these bulls were constructed and moved were found at the palace of Senacherib in [[Nineveh]]. <ref>''Mesopotamia: The Mighty Kings'' pp 114-115 </ref>
