'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Glenda''' (JTWC designation: '''''20S''''', also known as simply '''Cyclone Glenda''') was among the strongest [[tropical cyclone]]s to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[Western Australia]], though it moved ashore in a lightly populated region. It began as a tropical low on [[March 15]] in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. The precursor disturbance drifted over [[Top End]] and later across the northeastern portion of Western Australia, and after emerging into the [[Indian Ocean]] it strengthened into a tropical storm. Aided by favourable environmental conditions, Glenda rapidly intensified to reach Category&nbsp;5 status on the [[tropical cyclone scales|Australian cyclone scale]], and with a peak intensity of 910&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] it was among the strongest cyclones on record within the Australia region. On [[March 30]] it moved ashore near [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]] as a Category&nbsp;3 cyclone, and the next day it degenerated into a remnant tropical low over land.

The precursor disturbance produced heavy rainfall in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of Western Australia, causing record flooding and some road damage. Minor damage was reported at the final landfall of Glenda. Due to the sparse population and preparations made, the cyclone was not responsible for any deaths or injuries. However, its name was later retired from the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names|list of tropical cyclone names]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Glenda 2006 track.png}}
On [[March 15]], a tropical disturbance developed in the southwestern [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. It moved westward, drifting across [[Top End]], and it exited into the [[Joseph Bonaparte Gulf]] on [[March 22]].<ref name="sigw">{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2006|title=Significant Weather - March 2006|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=2008-04-13|format=PDF|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/public/sigwxsum/pdf/sigw0306.pdf}}</ref> The [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM) office in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], which is the local [[Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre]], began issuing advisories on the system late on [[March 23]] while it was located about 85&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (50&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) east-southeast of [[Wyndham, Western Australia]]. Environmental conditions favored intensification as an [[anticyclone]] developed over the storm, which provided good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] and low vertical [[wind shear]]. Initially, the primary inhibiting factor was land interaction.<ref name="gp">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2006|title=March 2006 Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Summary|accessdate=2008-04-13|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2006/summ0603.htm}}</ref> After executing a small loop over water, the disturbance continued westward, crossing over the northern portion of [[Western Australia]] before emerging into the [[Indian Ocean]] on [[March 26]].<ref name="bom">{{cite web|author=Western Australian Regional Office|year=2006|title=Severe Tropical Cyclone Glenda|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=2008-04-13|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/sevwx/wa/watc20060315.shtml}}</ref> It began tracking west-southwestward just offshore of the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] coastline, and its [[convection]] quickly concentrated. At 0000&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on [[March 27]], the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Cyclone 20S. Three hours later, the BoM office in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Glenda about 260&nbsp;km (160&nbsp;mi) north of [[Derby, Western Australia]].<ref name="gp"/>

Upon reaching open waters, Glenda quickly intensified, and midday on [[March 27]] the BoM upgraded it to [[tropical cyclone scales|tropical cyclone status]], or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane.<ref name="gp"/> Shortly thereafter, the JTWC followed suit by upgrading it to cyclone status just 12&nbsp;hours after first warning on the storm.<ref name="warnings">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2006|title=Warnings on Cyclone Glenda|accessdate=2008-04-13|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2006/tropical_cyclone_glenda.htm}}</ref> A wind gust of 113&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph) was reported on [[List of islands of Western Australia, 0-9, A-C|Adele Island]] as the cyclone passed nearby.<ref name="sigw"/> The track turned southwestward around a steering [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over Australia, aided by a mid-latitude [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. By [[March 27]], Glenda had developed a [[eye (cyclone)|banding eye]], and subsequently began [[rapid deepening]], with warm water temperatures of over 30<U+00BA>&nbsp;[[Celsius|C]] (86<U+00BA>&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|F]]) and a very favorable upper-level environment. At 1200&nbsp;UTC on [[March 28]], the JTWC classified Glenda with peak winds of 260&nbsp;km/h (160&nbsp;mph) about 235&nbsp;km (145&nbsp;mi) west-northwest of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], or about 455&nbsp;km (280&nbsp;mi) north-northeast of [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]].<ref name="warnings"/> At the same time the BoM estimated the cyclone attained peak winds of 215&nbsp;km/h (135&nbsp;mph) with gusts to 300&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph), or a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Tropical cyclone scales#South Pacific|Australian cyclone scale]].<ref name="bom"/> Its peak intensity of 910&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] was tied for the fifth [[list of most intense tropical cyclones|most intense tropical cyclone on record]] in the Australian basin.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2006|title=Australian Region Best Track 1907-2006|accessdate=2007-11-04|format=Zip|url=ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon2/home/ncc/cyclone/cyclones_newformat.zip}}</ref>

Initially, Cyclone Glenda was forecasted to intensify further. However, a gradual increase in vertical shear caused the eye to become disorganized,<ref name="warnings"/> with land interaction contributing to further weakening. The BoM maintained Glenda as a Category&nbsp;5 cyclone until [[March 29]],<ref name="bom"/> and initially it was forecasted to turn southward to move ashore near the populated region of [[Karratha, Western Australia|Karratha]] at high tide.<ref name="0506sum">{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2006|title=WA Tropical Cyclone Season Summary 2005-06|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=2008-04-14|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/seasonsummary200506.shtml}}</ref> It retained its southwest track and passed over several weather stations, one of which recorded sustained winds of 176&nbsp;km/h (109&nbsp;mph).<ref name="sigw"/> Glenda made [[landfall (meteorology)|meteorology)]] near the less populated city of [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]] at around 1200&nbsp;UTC on [[March 30]].<ref name="gp"/> Sustained winds were estimated at Category&nbsp;3 status on the Australian cyclone scale at landfall, or between 118&ndash;159&nbsp;km/h (73&ndash;98&nbsp;mph);<ref name="bom"/> this ranked Glenda as one of the strongest tropical cyclones to make landfall in Western Australia.<ref>{{cite news|author=David Braithwaite|date=2006-03-30|title=Cyclone Glenda 'as strong as Larry'|publisher=Sidney Morning Herald|accessdate=2008-04-15|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/cyclone-glenda-as-strong-as-larry/2006/03/30/1143441261449.html}}</ref> The JTWC issued its final warning on Glenda shortly after it moved ashore. The cyclone turned south and south-southeastward and rapidly weakened over land in an area of increasing wind shear, and early on [[March 31]] the BoM downgraded Glenda to a tropical low.<ref name="gp"/>

==Preparations and impact==

The precursor system dropped heavy rainfall on [[March 23]] in eastern [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] in the state of [[Western Australia]]. The rainfall led to record flooding in the area; the flooding washed out several roads near [[Kununurra, Western Australia|Kununurra]], including a portion of the [[Great Northern Highway]]. Six people were evacuated due to the flooding.<ref name="cyclone4">{{cite web|author=Fire and Emergency Services Authority|year=2007|title=2005-06 Cyclones in Western Australia|format=PDF|url=http://www.fesa.wa.gov.au/internet/upload/353351307/docs/cyclone4.pdf|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref>

Offshore, the threat of Glenda prompted officials to close oil, representing a lack of production of 154,000&nbsp;barrels of oil. Additionally, natural gas fields were closed, and several ports along the coastline were shut down during the passage of the storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bloomberg|date=2006-03-29|title=Cyclone Glenda Shuts Ports, Oil Fields in Australia|accessdate=2008-04-15|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000081&sid=abwzkrF1MJ0E&refer=australia}}</ref> Prior to it making landfall, officials issued a Red Alert for several communities in the path of the cyclone. Storm shelters were opened in [[Karratha, Western Australia|Karratha]] and [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]].<ref name="cyclone4"/> A few hundred people evacuated along the coastline.<ref name="ca2006">{{cite web|author=Impact Forecasting|year=2006|title=Annual Global Climate and Catastrophe Report: 2006|accessdate=2008-04-15|format=PDF|url=http://www.aon.com/about/publications/pdf/issues/global_climate_catastrophe_report_2006.pdf}}</ref> 

Glenda made landfall near [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]], where sustained winds reached 117&nbsp;km/h (72&nbsp;mph). There, the storm produced a 24&nbsp;hour rainfall total of 206&nbsp;mm (8.11&nbsp;in), which is the sixth greatest daily precipitation on record in the city. Several other locations reported over 200&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;in), though overall precipitation was less than a usual landfalling tropical cyclone.<ref name="sigw"/> The rainfall flooded several roads.<ref name="cyclone4"/> The winds downed several trees and power lines,<ref name="theage">{{cite web|author=Australian Associated Press|date=2006-03-31|title=Pilbara unscathed by cyclone Glenda|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Glenda-unleashes-fury-on-Onslow/2006/03/31/1143441300330.html|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref> which left about 2,000&nbsp;people in Karratha without electricity;<ref name="ca2006"/> the power outage was quickly repaired.<ref name="theage"/> Several windows at the hospital in Onslow were broken, resulting in some minor water damage.<ref name="theage"/> Overall damage was minor,<ref name="bom"/> and no deaths or injuries were reported,<ref name="theage"/> which was credited to the storm's weakening and preparations in the landfall area.<ref name="bom"/>

The Bureau of Meteorology retired the name ''Glenda'' following its usage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2008|title=Tropical Cyclone Names|accessdate=2008-04-15|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/cyclone/about/cyclone-names.shtml}}</ref>
