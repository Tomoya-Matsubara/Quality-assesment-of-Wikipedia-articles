'''William Thad Cochran''' (born December 7, 1937 in [[Pontotoc, Mississippi]]) is the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Mississippi]], and is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].
==Early life==
He was born in [[Pontotoc, Mississippi]], to William Holmes Cochran and Emma Grace ([[Married and maiden names|nee]] Berry), a [[school principal]] and a [[teacher]], respectively.  His family settled in [[Hinds County, Mississippi]], home of the state capital, [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], in [[1946]] after a few moves around the northern part of the state. Cochran still lives in Jackson today.Cochran earned [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] as a youth and was awarded the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] as an adult. He graduated from Byram High School near Jackson and received a B.A. degree from the [[University of Mississippi]] with a major in [[psychology]] and a minor in [[political science]] in 1959. There he joined the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] Fraternity and was on the [[cheerleading]] squad with fellow senator [[Trent Lott]]. After a time in the [[United States Navy]] (1959<U+2013>1961), he attended the [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law, was elected to the [[Phi Kappa Phi]] honor society and graduated in 1965. He then practiced law for seven years. He married Rose Clayton on June 6, 1964; the couple has two children.

Cochran grew up as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], but became a Republican sometime in the mid-to-late 1960s. He served as head of [[Richard Nixon]]'s Mississippi campaign in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]]. 

==United States Congress==
In 1972, [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Charles H. Griffin]] of {{ushr|Mississippi|3}} decided not to run for a third full term. Cochran won the Republican nomination for the Jackson-based district, which was renumbered as {{ushr|Mississippi|4}} after redistricting.He defeated Democratic state senator Ellis Bodron by just under four points. A factor in Cochran's victory was the strong Republican showing in [[United States presidential election, 1972|that year's presidential election]], in which Nixon won 49 of 50 states, and 78&nbsp;percent of Mississippi's popular vote. That year, Cochran and [[Trent Lott]] (who later served alongside him in the U.S. Senate) became the second and third Republicans to represent Mississippi in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Cochran quickly became very popular in this district, even though almost none of its living residents had been represented by a Republican before.  He was handily reelected in 1974, a year in which anger over the [[Watergate scandal]] caused several Republicans to lose their seats. He was reelected by an even larger margin in 1976.

In 1978, Cochran, running for the U.S. Senate in the wake of [[James Eastland]]'s decision not not to run for re-election, then defeated Democrat Maurice Dantin and [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidate [[Charles Evers]]. This made him the first Republican to win a statewide election in Mississippi since Reconstruction. Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader [[Medgar Evers]], may have siphoned off many black votes that would have otherwise gone to Dantin.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

When Eastland resigned two days after Christmas, Cochran was appointed to the seat by governor [[Cliff Finch]] and started his Senate career a week early. He handily defeated [[governor of Mississippi|Governor]] [[William Winter (politician)|William Winter]] in 1984, was unopposed in 1990, reelected with over 70 percent of the vote in 1996 and faced no major-party opposition in 2002.  He won reelection in 2008 by a wide margin over [[Erik Fleming]];  assuming Cochran completes his current term, he will pass Eastland as the second-longest serving Senator in Mississippi's history.  Until 1989, Cochran served alongside longtime Democrat [[John Stennis]], the longest-serving Senator in Mississippi's history.  He is currently the eighth-longest serving Senator, and the third longest-serving Republican.

Cochran's voting record is considered fairly moderate by Southern conservative standards.  He has a lifetime rating of 80 from the [[American Conservative Union]].  In 2008, he garnered a rating of 68 from the ACU; the only Republican Senators from a Southern state to score lower were [[Mel Martinez]] of [[Florida]] and [[John Warner]] of [[Virginia]]. He has maintained a lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest for a six-term Senator.  This stands in marked contrast to Eastland, Stennis and Lott.

However, Cochran has considerable influence behind the scenes, especially in Mississippi. This is not surprising given his status as the "elder statesman" of the state Republican Party. In April 2006, Cochran was selected by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of "America's 10 Best Senators"; the magazine quoted an unnamed "senior GOP Senator" who said "He doesn't get a whole lot of play in terms of coverage, but he is effectively stubborn doing what needs to be done."  For example, in December 2005 he bluntly said a defense spending bill wouldn't pass unless it included funding for the Gulf Coast, which had been ravaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]].  <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1183976,00.html Thad Cochran: The Quiet Persuader], an April 2006 ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine article</ref>

Cochran served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference (caucus) from 1991 to 1996, and is its only former chair currently in the Senate; he chaired the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry|Senate Agriculture Committee]] from 2003 to 2005. In 2005, he was appointed as chairman of the powerful [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]], making him the first Republican from a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] to chair the committee.  He is currently that committee's [[ranking member|ranking]] Republican.
 
It appears that recognition from his colleagues was quick in coming: In 2005, an agricultural appropriations bill proposed by the Committee Cochran chaired contained a provision (sec. 782) that said:
{{cquote|The Federal facility located at the South Mississippi Branch Experiment Station in [[Poplarville, Mississippi]], and known as the "Southern Horticultural Laboratory", shall be known and designated as the "Thad Cochran Southern Horticultural Laboratory"<ref>[http://www.rules.house.gov/109/text/hr2744/109hr2744cr_congrecord.htm Committee On Rules - Announcements<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}

In April 2006, he was selected by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of "America's 10 Best Senators."<ref>http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1183976,00.html</ref>

On July 18, 2006, Cochran voted, along with 19 Republican Senators, for the [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]] to lift restrictions on federal funding for the research.

In 2005 he was one of nine senators who voted against the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]], which prohibited "inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]]". The others, all Republicans, were [[Wayne Allard]], [[Kit Bond]], [[Tom Coburn]], [[Jeff Sessions]], [[Jim Inhofe]], [[Pat Roberts]], [[John Cornyn]] and [[Ted Stevens]].

In March 2009 his former aide, [[Ann Copland]], pleaded guilty to swapping legislative favors for event tickets and other gifts from lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]]. Copland worked for Cochran for 29 years.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/03/10/washington/AP-Abramoff-Senate-Aide.html</ref>
Cochran has not been indicted for any charges in connection to [[Jack Abramoff]].

==2008 re-election campaign==

Then, later in the campaign [[Erik R. Fleming]] (a former Mississippi state senator) won the Democratic nomination and went on against Cochran. On November 5, 2008, Cochran won by a landslide with over 61% of the vote against Fleming (D) with only 38% of the vote.

Cochran originally endorsed [[Fred Thompson]] for President; however, in light of Thompson's withdrawal, he endorsed former [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]] for president.  When Romney dropped out of the race, Cochran endorsed Senator [[John McCain]], who lost the general election campaign to Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]].
