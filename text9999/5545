'''Murasaki Shikibu''' ([[wikt:<U+7D2B>|<U+7D2B>]][[wikt:<U+5F0F>|<U+5F0F>]][[wikt:<U+90E8>|<U+90E8>]]; c. 973&ndash;c. 1014 or 1025), or '''Lady Murasaki''' as she is often known in English, was a [[Japan]]ese [[novelist]], [[poet]], and a maid of honor of the [[Emperor of Japan|imperial court]] during the [[Heian Period|Heian period]]. She is best known as the author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] between about 1000 and 1008, one of the earliest [[novels]] in human history.  

"Murasaki Shikibu" was not her real name, which is unknown. Some scholars have postulated that her given name might have been '''Fujiwara Takako''', recorded as a name of a lady-in-waiting ranked ''sh<U+014D>ji'' on the 29th day of the 1st month, [[Kank<U+014D>]] 4 (February 19, 1007) according to ''Mid<U+014D> Kampaku Ki'', a diary written by [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]], although this theory has not been supported by many others.<ref>(a) [[:jp:<U+89D2><U+7530><U+6587><U+885E>|Bunei Tsunoda]] "Real name of Murasahiki Shikibu" ''Kodai Bunka (Cultura antiqua)'' 1963, no.7. (b) [[:jp:<U+4ECA><U+4E95><U+6E90><U+885B>|Gen-e Imai]] "Questions on the theory of the real name of Murasaki Shikibu as Takako" ''Kokugo Kokubun (Japanese Language and Literature)'' Vol. 34 (no. 1) (1965). Both articles in Japanese.</ref>  Her own diary, ''[[The Murasaki Shikibu Diary]]'', states that she was nicknamed "Murasaki" ("Violet") at court, after a character in ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. "Shikibu" refers to her father's position in the Bureau of Ceremony (''[[shikibu-sh<U+014D>]]'').

==Biography==
Lady Murasaki Shikibu was born about 973 in Kyoto, Japan. She was born in a family of minor nobility and a member of the northern branch of the [[Fujiwara family|Fujiwara clan]].

Murasaki's mother died while she was a child, so Murasaki was raised, contrary to customs of the time, by her father [[Fujiwara no Tametoki]], a scholar and officer of the imperial court. During [[Heian period|Heian]]-era Japan, couples lived separately and children were raised by the mother and her family. Also contrary to customs of the time, her father gave her a male education. Men were taught [[kanji]] and [[classical Chinese]] literature as the requisite culture, while women were taught [[kana]] and [[poetry]]. Her father praised her intelligence and ability, but lamented that she was "born a woman". She was married in her early 20s and had one child, [[Daini no Sanmi]], who was a poet in her own right.<ref>Kenneth Rexroth and Ikuko Atsumi, ''Women Poets of Japan'', New Directions Press (1982) at 143.</ref>

At the royal court, she was the lady-in-waiting for Empress Shoshi (Akiko) and may have been hired by [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] to serve the Empress.

Murasaki died either in 1014, when records show that her father suddenly returned to [[Kyoto]] from his governor's mansion, or between 1025 and 1031, when she would have been in her mid-50s, fairly old by Heian standards.

Three works are attributed to Murasaki, the most important being ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. ''[[The Murasaki Shikibu Diary]]'' and ''The Murasaki Shikibu Collection'' were arranged and published posthumously. The collection is a compilation of 128 poems written by Murasaki.

== Legacy and influence ==

Murasaki is considered one of the greatest writers of Japanese literature. Statues in her honour have been erected throughout Japan, her works are a staple part of the education curriculum in Japan. The [[Banknotes of the Japanese yen#Commemorative series D (2000, the current issue)|2000 yen]] note was issued in commemoration to her and her greatest epic work, ''The Tale of Genji''. She was a lady-in-waiting for Emperor Ichijo at the time. After his death, she became the lady-in-waiting for the Empress Akiko.

A fictionalized biography of Murasaki called ''The Tale of Murasaki: A Novel'' was written by [[Liza Dalby]]. Another fictionalized biography of Murasaki Shikibu is an Italian novel by
Gabriella Magrini: ''Mille Autunni, vita di Murasaki Dama di Corte'', Edizione Frassinelli 1985; translated into French under the title ''La dame de Kyoto'', Editions Belfond, 1987, ISBN 2 7144 1973 9. A fictitious descendant of Lady Murasaki is a major character in the Thomas Harris novel and subsequent horror film ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]''.

<!--The above note seems to be wrong. While the name is a pseudonym, Shikibu appears from the text to be the "family" name here. This author is probably more commonly known by her first name, however.-->
