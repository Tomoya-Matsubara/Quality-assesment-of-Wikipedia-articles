The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T1''''' was a [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]], T-group sea-going [[torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as '''''76 T''''' in 1914. She was armed with two [[<U+0160>koda Works|<U+0160>koda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30 guns, four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10<U+2013>12 [[naval mine]]s. She saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. She was part of the escort force during the action that resulted in the sinking of Austro-Hungarian [[dreadnought]] [[SMS Szent Istv<U+00E1>n|SMS ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'']] by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] torpedo boats. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, ''76 T'' was allocated to the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], which subsequently became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T1''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by the Italians and served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was captured by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and handed over to the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]] who renamed her '''''Gole<U+0161>nica'''''. She was transferred to the [[Yugoslav Navy]] after [[World War II]], and after a refit which included replacement of her armament, continued to serve as ''Gole<U+0161>nica'' until 1959.

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und k<U+00F6>nigliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at [[Kotor|Cattaro]] to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The T-group designation signified the builder, STT.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]] T-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|262|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|320|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by a [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] steam turbine driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. They carried {{convert|18|t|LT}} of coal and {{convert|24|t|LT}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|980|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The T-group had one [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] rather than the two funnels of the later groups of the class. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} 

The boats were originally to be armed with three [[<U+0160>koda Works|<U+0160>koda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}}L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and three {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed,{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} in order to standardise the armament with the following F-group. They could also carry 10<U+2013>12 [[naval mine]]s. ''76 T'' was the third of its class to be completed, and was laid down on 24 June 1913, launched on 15 December 1913, and completed on 20 July 1914. Eight T-group boats were completed between February and December 1914, designated ''74 T'' <U+2013> ''81 T''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1914, one {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]] was added.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

==Career==
===World War I===
The 250t-class, T-group were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with the boats.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''76 T'' was part of the 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla.{{sfn|Greger|1976|pp=11<U+2013>12}} During World War I, ''76 T'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''76 T'' and the rest of the 250t-class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26<U+2013>27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

By 1918, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the [[Imperial German Navy|German]] and Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]]s to get through the strait and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In response to these new measures at blockading the straits, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Horthy]] decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with [[battleship]]s, [[scout cruiser]]s, and [[destroyer]]s.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=133<U+2013>134}}

During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of [[Pula|Pola]] in the upper Adriatic with {{ship|SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen||2}}. After some difficulties getting the harbour defense barrage opened, about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, {{ship|SMS|Szent Istv<U+00E1>n||2}} and {{ship|SMS|Tegetthoff||2}},{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}} escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including ''76 T'', also departed Pola. They were en route to the harbour at [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] to rendezvous with ''Viribus Unitis'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', for a coordinated attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]]. About 03:15 on 10 June,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sources differ on what the exact time was when the attack took place. Sieche states that the time was 3:15 am when the ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' was hit,{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}} while Sokol claims that the time was 3:30 am.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=134}}}} two [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthoff'', but her torpedoes missed.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=135}}

Under the command of [[Luigi Rizzo]], ''MAS 15'' fired two torpedoes at 03:25, and both hit ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n''. Both boats evaded pursuit although Rizzo had to discourage ''76 T'' by dropping [[depth charge]]s in her wake. The torpedo hits on ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' were abreast her boiler rooms, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed.{{sfn|Sieche|1991|pp=127, 131}}

===Interwar period===
''76 T'' survived the war intact,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] concluded in September 1919, she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia) in 1920, along with three other 250t-class, T-group boats, ''77 T'' <U+2013> ''79 T'', which all served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; <U+041A>pa<U+0459>e<U+0432>c<U+043A>a <U+0408><U+0443><U+0433><U+043E><U+0441><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> P<U+0430><U+0442><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430>). In KJRM service, ''76 T'' was re-named ''T1''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===World War II and post-war service===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T1'' was assigned to the Southern Sector of the KJRM's Coastal Defence Command based at the [[Bay of Kotor]], along with her [[sister ship]] [[Yugoslav torpedo boat T3|''T3'']] and a number of [[minesweeper]]s and other craft.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013}} ''T1'' was captured by the Italian Navy and was operated by them under her Yugoslav designation. When the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, the Germans seized her and transferred her to the [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Mornarica Nezavisne Dr<U+017E>ave Hrvatske}}). She was renamed ''Gole<U+0161>nica'' and continued in Croatian service until the end of the war. She was transferred to the [[Yugoslav Navy]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|Jugoslavenska Ratna Mornarica|links=no}}, <U+0408><U+0443><U+0433><U+043E><U+0441><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> P<U+0430><U+0442><U+043D><U+0430> M<U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430>) after the war. Her post-war fitout included replacing her original guns with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on single mounts and four {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, and removing her torpedo tubes. She continued in Yugoslav service under that name until October 1959, when she was stricken.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}
