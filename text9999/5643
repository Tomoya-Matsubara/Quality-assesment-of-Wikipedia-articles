'''<U+00C9>amon de Valera'''<ref>His name is frequently misspelled ''Eamonn De Valera'' but in fact he never used the second 'n' in his first name (the standard Irish spelling) and always a small 'd' in 'de Valera', which is proper in Spanish names (de meaning 'of').</ref><ref>"<U+00C9>amon(n)" actually translates into English as Edmond or Edmund.

His political career spanned over half a century, from 1917 to 1973; he served multiple terms as head of government and head of state, and is credited with a leading role in the authorship of the present-day [[Constitution of Ireland]].<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=13&MemberID=301&ConstID=26|title=Mr. <U+00C9>amon de Valera|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>

De Valera was a leader of Ireland's struggle for independence from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|anti-Treaty]] opposition in the ensuing [[Irish Civil War]] (1922<U+2013>1923), in which he opposed  [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], but was defeated. In 1926, he founded [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]], and became prime minister (1932<U+2013>48, 1951<U+2013>54, and 1957<U+2013>58). His political creed evolved from militant [[Irish republican|republicanism]] to social and cultural conservatism.<ref>Ferriter, ''Judging Dev: A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of Eamon De Valera''. (2007)</ref>

De Valera used military tribunals and the newly created Army Volunteer Reserve to thwart efforts of both the [[Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Army Comrades Association]] during the 1930s.<ref>J. Lee, "The Impact of de Valera", pp. 180-181.</ref>

Assessments of De Valera's career have varied; he has often been characterized as a stern, unbending, devious, and divisive Irish politician. Biographer [[Tim Pat Coogan]] sees his time in power as being characterised by economic and cultural stagnation, while [[Diarmaid Ferriter]] argues that the stereotype of De Valera as an austere, cold and even backward figure was largely manufactured in the 1960s and is misguided.<ref>Ferriter, ''Judging Dev: a reassessment of the life and legacy of Eamon de Valera'' (2007)</ref>

==His family==
De Valera was born in [[New York City]] in 1882 to an Irish mother; his parents, [[Catherine Coll]] (subsequently Mrs Wheelwright), an immigrant from [[Bruree]], [[County Limerick]], and Juan Vivion de Valera, a [[Cuba]]n settler and sculptor of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent, were reportedly married on 18 September 1881 at St. Patrick's Church in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], however, archivists have not located any such marriage certificate or any birth, baptismal, or death certificate information for anyone called Juan Vivion de Valera or de Valeros, an alternative spelling. On De Valera's original birth certificate, his name is given as George De Valero and his father is listed as Vivion De Valero. The first name was changed in 1910 to Edward and the surname corrected to de Valera.<ref name="homepage">[http://homepage.eircom.net/%7Eseanjmurphy/irhismys/devalera.html "Eamon de Valera's father" 2006]</ref>

There were a number of occasions when de Valera seriously contemplated the religious life like his half-brother, Fr. Thomas Wheelwright, but ultimately did not pursue a vocation. De Valera was throughout his life portrayed as a deeply religious man, who in death asked to be buried in a religious habit. While his biographer, [[Tim Pat Coogan]], speculated that questions surrounding de Valera's legitimacy may have been a deciding factor in his not entering religious life, being illegitimate would have been a bar to receiving orders only as a secular or diocesan cleric, not as a member of a [[religious order]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Defect of Birth|author=James H. Driscoll|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02579b.htm|publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia|year= 1907|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref>

Juan Vivion died in 1885 leaving his widow and child in poor circumstances.<ref>[[Proinsias Mac Aonghusa]] ''Quotations from <U+00C9>amon de Valera'' page 89 (1983) ISBN 0-85342-684-8.</ref> <U+00C9>amon was taken to Ireland by his Uncle Ned at the age of two<!--or3?-->. Even when his mother married a new husband in the mid-1880s, he was not brought back to live with her but reared instead by his grandmother Elizabeth Coll, her son Patrick and her daughter Hannie, in County Limerick. He was educated locally at Bruree National School, County Limerick and [[Charleville, County Cork|Charleville]] [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers School]], County Cork. Aged sixteen, he won a scholarship to [[Blackrock College]], [[County Dublin]], where he began playing rugby. Later during his tenure at [[Rockwell College]], he joined the school's rugby team where he played fullback on the first team, which reached the final of the Munster Senior Cup. De Valera went on to play for the [[Munster rugby]] team in the mid 1900s in the fullback position and remained a lifelong devotee of rugby, attending numerous international matches up to and towards the end of his life despite near blindness. He also developed an intensely close relationship with the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Holy Ghost Order]] and its Blackrock College school from this time. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Always a diligent student, at the end of his first year in [[Blackrock College]] he was Student of the Year. He also won further scholarships and exhibitions and in 1903 was appointed teacher of mathematics at [[Rockwell College]], [[County Tipperary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/de_valera_eamon.shtml|title=<U+00C9>amon de Valera (1882<U+2013>1975)|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref> It was here that de Valera was first given the nickname "Dev" by a teaching colleague, Tom O'Donnell. In 1904, he graduated in mathematics from the [[Royal University of Ireland]].  He then studied for a year at [[Trinity College Dublin]] but owing to the necessity of earning a living did not proceed further and returned to [[Dublin]] to teach at [[Blackrock College]].<ref>[http://www.rhs.ac.uk/bibl/wwwopac.exe?&database=dcatalo&rf=700037617&SUCCESS=false&SRT2=ti&SEQ2=ascending RHS Bibliography <U+2013> Farragher, Sean.

His applications for professorships in colleges of the [[National University of Ireland]] were unsuccessful, but he obtained a part-time appointment at [[Maynooth]] and also taught mathematics at various Dublin schools, including [[Castleknock College]] (1910<U+2013>1911; under the name Edward de Valera) and [[Belvedere College]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/amon_de_Valera|title=<U+00C9>amon de Valera|work=UCC <U+2013> Multitext Project in Irish History|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref> where he taught [[Kevin Barry]], an Irish republican executed in 1920 for his part in an ambush of British soldiers  during the [[Irish War of Independence]], which claimed the lives of three soldiers. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

De Valera's children were five sons: Vivion, <U+00C9>amon, Brian, Ruairi and Terence (Terry), and two daughters: M<U+00E1>ir<U+00ED>n and Emer. Brian de Valera predeceased his parents.

==Early political activity==
As a young ''Gaeilgeoir'' (Irish speaker), he became an activist for the language. In 1908 he joined the <U+00C1>rdchraobh of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] (the Gaelic League), where he met [[Sin<U+00E9>ad de Valera|Sin<U+00E9>ad Flanagan]], a teacher by profession, and four years his senior. They were married on 8 January 1910 at St Paul's Church, Arran Quay, [[Dublin]].

While he was already involved in the [[Gaelic Revival]], de Valera's involvement in the political revolution began on 25 November 1913 when he joined the [[Irish Volunteers]] formed to oppose the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and ensure the enactment of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]'s [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Act]] won by its leader [[John Redmond]]. After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, de Valera rose through the ranks and it was not long before he was elected captain of the [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]] company. Preparations were pushed ahead for an armed revolt, and he was made commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade. He took part in the [[Howth gun-running]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dwane|first=David T.|title=Early Life of Eamonn De Valera|publisher=The Talbott Press Limited|year=1922|location=Dublin|pages=43|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/earlylifeofeamon00dwan/earlylifeofeamon00dwan_djvu.txt}}</ref>  He was sworn by [[Thomas MacDonagh]] into the oath-bound [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], which secretly controlled the central executive of the Volunteers.

==Easter Rising==
On 24 April 1916 the rising began. De Valera occupied [[Boland's Mill]], Grand Canal Street in [[Dublin]], his chief task being to cover the south-eastern approaches to the city. After a week of fighting the order came from [[Patrick Pearse]] to surrender. De Valera was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to [[penal servitude]] for life. It has been argued that he was saved by four facts. First, he was one of the last to surrender and he was held in a different prison from other leaders, thus his execution was delayed by practicalities; had he been held with [[Patrick Pearse]] and others, he probably would have been one of the first executed. Second, the American Consulate in Dublin made representations before his trial while the full legal situation (i.e., ''was'' he actually a United States citizen and if so, how would the United States react to the execution of one of its citizens?) was clarified. The fact that [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|U.K.]] was trying to bring the USA into the war in Europe at the time made the situation even more delicate, though this did not prevent the execution of [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] who had been an American citizen since 1882.<ref>Brian Barton. ''From Behind a Closed Door: Secret Court Martial Records of the Easter Rising'', Blackstaff Press Ltd, 2005, p. 147</ref> Third, when Lt-Gen [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Sir John Maxwell]] reviewed his case he said "Who is he? I haven't heard of him before. I wonder would he be likely to make trouble in the future?" on being told that de Valera was unimportant he commuted the court-martial's death sentence to life imprisonment.<ref>Barton, ibid., p. 93</ref> De Valera had no [[Fenian]] family or personal background and his [[MI5]] file in 1916 was very slim, only detailing his open membership of the [[Irish Volunteers]].<ref>Barton, ibid., p. 92</ref> Fourth, by the time of de Valera was court-martialled on 8 May political pressure being brought to bear on Maxwell to halt the executions except and he had already told the [[Prime Minister]] [[Herbert Asquith]] that only two more were to be executed; [[Se<U+00E1>n Mac Diarmada]] and [[James Connolly]], who were court-martialled the day ''after'' de Valera. His late trial, representations made by the American Consulate, his lack of [[Fenian]] background and political pressure all combined to save his life, though had he been tried a week earlier he would probably have been shot.<ref>Barton, ibid., pp. 91-94</ref>

De Valera's supporters and detractors argue about de Valera's bravery during the [[Easter Rising]]. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and a meticulous ability for planning. His detractors claim he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916 de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to sit beside him and wake him if he was needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes "wild", screaming, "Set fire to the railway! Set fire to the railway!" Later in the Ballykinlar [[internment]] Camp, one de Valera loyalist approached another internee, a medical doctor, recounted the story and asked for a medical opinion as to de Valera's condition. He also threatened to sue the doctor, future [[Fine Gael]] TD and minister, Dr. Tom O'Higgins, if he ever repeated the story.<ref>Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993) hardback. pp. 69-72. ISBN 0-09-175030-X</ref>

After imprisonment in [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor]], [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone]] and [[Lewes (HM Prison)|Lewes]] prisons, de Valera and his comrades were released under an amnesty in June 1917. On 10 July 1917 he was elected member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for [[East Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|East Clare]] (the constituency which he represented until 1959) in a by-election caused by the death of the previous incumbent [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|Willie Redmond]], brother of the Irish Party Leader John Redmond who had died fighting in [[World War I]]. In the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]] he was elected both for that seat and [[East Mayo (UK Parliament constituency)|Mayo East]].<ref name=elecs_irl>
{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=921|title=<U+00C9>amon de Valera|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref> In 1917 he was elected president of [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], the party which had been blamed incorrectly for provoking the Easter Rising. This party became the political vehicle through which the survivors of the Easter Rising chanelled their republican ethos and objectives. The previous president of Sinn F<U+00E9>in, [[Arthur Griffith]], had championed an Anglo-Irish dual-monarchy based on the Austro-Hungarian model, with independent legislatures for both Ireland and Britain. This solution would, mutatis mutandis, emulate the situation following the [[Constitution of 1782]] under [[Henry Grattan]], until Ireland was legislatively subsumed into [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801.

==President of D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann==
{{PriomhAire}}
Sinn F<U+00E9>in won a huge majority in the [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|1918 general election]], largely thanks to the [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|British executions]] of the 1916 leaders, the threat of conscription with the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]] and the first past the post ballot. They won 73 out of 105 Irish seats, with about 47% of votes cast. 25 seats were uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 Sinn F<U+00E9>in MPs (the rest were imprisoned or impaired), calling themselves [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la|Teachta<U+00ED> D<U+00E1>la]] (TDs), assembled in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in Dublin and formed an Irish parliament, known as [[First D<U+00E1>il|D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]] (translatable into English as the ''Assembly of Ireland''). A ministry or [[Aireacht]] was formed, under the leadership of the [[President of D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann|Pr<U+00ED>omh Aire]] ''(also called [[President of D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]])'' [[Cathal Brugha]]. De Valera had been re-arrested in May 1918 and imprisoned and so could not attend the January session of the D<U+00E1>il. He escaped from [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] Gaol in February 1919. As a result he replaced Brugha as Pr<U+00ED>omh Aire in the April session of D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann. However, the [[D<U+00E1>il Constitution]] passed by the D<U+00E1>il in 1919 made clear that the Pr<U+00ED>omh Aire (or President of D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann as it came to be called) was merely [[prime minister]] - the literal translation of Pr<U+00ED>omh Aire - not a full [[head of state]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In the hope of securing international recognition, [[Se<U+00E1>n T. O'Kelly]] was sent as envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] convened by the great powers at the end of the [[World War I]]. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the [[Irish Republic]], to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the [[Irish Republican Army]]), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success. He met the young Harvard-educated leader from [[Puerto Rico]], [[Pedro Albizu Campos]], and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

De Valera managed to raise a sum of $5,500,000 from American supporters, an amount that far exceeded the hopes of the D<U+00E1>il.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.S.192108170006.html|title=D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann - Volume 2 - Vote of thanks to the people of America|date=17 August 1921|work=Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref> Of this, $500,000 was devoted to the American presidential campaign in 1920 which helped him gain wider public support there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.F.C.192006290062.html|title=D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann - Volume 1 - Ministerial Motions. - Presidential election campaign in USA|date=29 June 1920|work=Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref> In 1921 it was said that $1,466,000 had already been spent, and it is unclear when the net balance arrived in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.F.C.192105100047.html|title=D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann - Volume 1 - Debates on Reports. - Finance|date=10 May 1921|work=Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref> Recognition was not forthcoming in the international sphere. He also had difficulties with various [[Irish-American]] leaders, such as [[John Devoy]] and Judge [[Daniel F. Cohalan]], who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States.

Meanwhile in Ireland, conflict between the [[British government|British authorities]] and the D<U+00E1>il (which they declared illegal in September 1919) escalated into the [[Irish War of Independence]] (also called the 'Anglo-Irish War'). ''The Long Fellow'' (or ''An t-Amad<U+00E1>n Fada'', another of de Valera's nicknames, given to him because of his great height, meaning the ''Long Fool'') left day to day government, during his eighteen month absence in America, to [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] (''The Big Fellow''), his twenty-nine year old [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] and rival. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==President of the Republic==
In January 1921, at his first D<U+00E1>il meeting after his return to a country gripped by the War of Independence, de Valera introduced a motion calling on the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] to desist from ambushes and other tactics that were allowing the British to successfully portray it as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group,<ref>D. G. Boyce, ''Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy, 1918-1922'' (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1972), pp. 92-93</ref> and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. This they strongly opposed, and de Valera relented, issuing a statement expressing support for the IRA, and claimed it was fully under the control of the D<U+00E1>il. He then, along with Cathal Brugha and [[Austin Stack]], brought pressure to bear on Michael Collins to undertake a journey to the U.S. himself, on the pretext that only he could take up where de Valera had left off. Collins successfully resisted this move, and stayed in Ireland. In the [[Irish elections, 1921|elections of May 1921]], all candidates in [[Southern Ireland]] were returned unopposed, and Sinn F<U+00E9>in secured some seats in [[Northern Ireland]]. Following the [[Irish War of Independence#Truce, July 1921 <U+2013> December 1921|Truce of July, 1921]] that ended the war, de Valera went to see [[David Lloyd George]] in London on 14 July. No agreement was reached, and by then the parliament of [[Northern Ireland]] had met. In August 1921, de Valera secured D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann approval to change the 1919 D<U+00E1>il [[Constitution]] to upgrade his office from prime minister or chairman of the cabinet to a full [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]]. Declaring himself now the Irish equivalent of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], he argued that as Irish head of state, in the absence of the British head of state from the negotiations, he ''too'' should not attend the peace conference called the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty Negotiations]] (October<U+2013>December 1921) at which British and Irish government leaders agreed to the effective independence of twenty-six of Ireland's [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] as the [[Irish Free State]], with Northern Ireland choosing to remain under British sovereignty. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} 

Having done so, a [[Irish Boundary Commission|boundary commission]] came into place to redraw the Irish border. [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] expected its report to recommend that largely nationalist areas become part of the Free State, and many hoped this would make Northern Ireland so small it would not be economically viable. A [[Council of Ireland]] was also provided in the Treaty as a model for an eventual all-Irish parliament. Hence neither the pro- nor anti-Treaty sides made much complaint about [[Partition of Ireland|partition]] in the [[Treaty Debates (Ireland)|Treaty debates]]. They all expected it would prove short-lived. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Anglo-Irish Treaty==
The Republic's delegates to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty Negotiations]] were accredited by President de Valera and his cabinet as [[plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] (that is, negotiators with the legal authority to sign a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty.<ref>P. S. O'Hegarty, ''A History of Ireland Under the Union: 1801 to 1922'' (New York: Kraus Reprint Co., 1969), 751.</ref> However, the Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a [[dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] with the King represented by a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]]. The Irish Treaty delegates [[Arthur Griffith]], [[Robert Barton]], and Michael Collins supported by [[Robert Erskine Childers]] as Secretary General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]]. It was there, at 11.15am on 5 December 1921, that the decision was made to recommend the Treaty to the [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]]; the Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:20 on 6 December 1921.

De Valera baulked at the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the negotiations because he knew what the outcome would be and did not wish to receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over the fact that they had not consulted with ''him'', their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the D<U+00E1>il during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises but they included dominion status, the ''Treaty Ports'', the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt was to be paid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.P.A.170001.html|title=De Valera's Treaty proposals|work=Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref>

After the Treaty was narrowly ratified by 64 to 57, de Valera and a large minority of Sinn F<U+00E9>in TDs left D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann. He then resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected [[President of D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]] in his place, though respectfully still calling him 'The President'. On a speaking tour of the more republican province of [[Munster]], starting on 17 March 1922, de Valera made controversial speeches at [[Carrick on Suir]], [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], [[Dungarvan]] and [[Waterford]], saying that: "''If the Treaty were accepted,'' [by the electorate] ''the fight for freedom would still go on, and the Irish people, instead of fighting foreign soldiers, will have to fight the Irish soldiers of an Irish government set up by Irishmen.''" At [[Thurles]], several days later, he repeated this imagery and added that the IRA: "''...would have to wade through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish Government, and perhaps through that of some members of the Irish Government to get their freedom.''" In a letter to the [[Irish Independent]] on 23 March de Valera accepted the accuracy of their report of his comment about "wading" through blood, but deplored that the newspaper had published it.<ref>J.J. O'Kelly ([[Sceilg]]) ''A Trinity of Martyrs'', Irish Book Bureau, Dublin; pp. 66-68. "Sceilg" was a supporter of de Valera in 1922.</ref> 

De Valera objected to the statement of fidelity that the treaty required Irish parliamentarians to take to the King. He also was concerned that Ireland could not have an independent foreign policy as part of the British Commonwealth when the British retained several naval ports (see [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]]) around Ireland's coast. As a compromise, de Valera proposed "external association" with the British Empire, which would leave Ireland's foreign policy in her own hands and a republican constitution with no mention of the British monarch (he proposed this as early as April, well before the negotiations began, under the title "Document No. 2"). Michael Collins was prepared to accept this formula and the two wings (pro- and anti-Treaty) of [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] formed a pact to fight the [[Irish general election, 1922]] together and form a coalition government afterwards. Collins later called off the pact on the eve of the election. De Valera's opponents won the election and civil war broke out shortly afterwards in late June 1922. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Civil War==
{{Main|Irish Civil War}}
Relations between the new Irish government, which was backed by most of the D<U+00E1>il and the electorate, and the anti-Treatyites under the nominal leadership of de Valera, now descended into the [[Irish Civil War]] (June 1922 to May 1923), in which the pro-treaty Free State forces defeated the anti-Treaty IRA. Both sides had wanted to avoid civil war, but fighting broke out over the takeover of the [[Four Courts]] building in Dublin by anti-Treaty members of the IRA. These men were not loyal to de Valera and initially were not even supported by the executive of the anti-Treaty IRA. However, Michael Collins was forced to act against them when [[Winston Churchill]] threatened to re-occupy the country with British troops unless action was taken. When fighting broke out in Dublin between the Four Courts garrison and the new Free State army, republicans backed the IRA men in the Four Courts and civil war broke out. De Valera, though he held no military position, backed the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|anti-Treaty IRA]] or "Irregulars" and said that he was re-enlisting in the IRA as an ordinary volunteer. On 8 September 1922, he met in secret with [[Richard Mulcahy]] in Dublin, to try to halt the fighting. However, according to de Valera, they "could not find a basis" for agreement.
{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Though nominally head of the anti-Treatyites, de Valera had little influence. He does not seem to have been involved in any fighting and had little or no influence with the military republican leadership - headed by IRA Chief of Staff, [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]]. De Valera and the anti-Treaty [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la|TDs]] formed a "[[Irish republican legitimatism|republican government]]" on 25 October 1922 from anti-Treaty TDs to "be temporarily the Supreme Executive of the Republic and the State, until such time as the elected Parliament of the Republic can freely assemble, or the people being rid of external aggression are at liberty to decide freely how they are to be governed". However it had no real authority and was a pale shadow of the republican D<U+00E1>il government of 1919<U+2013>21, which had provided an alternative government to the British administration. In March 1923, de Valera attended the meeting of the IRA Army Executive to decide on the future of the war. He was known to be in favour of a truce but he had no voting rights and it was narrowly decided to continue hostilities.

On 30 May 1923, the IRA's new Chief of Staff [[Frank Aiken]] (Lynch had been killed) called a ceasefire and ordered volunteers to "dump arms". De Valera, who had wanted an end to the internecine fighting for some time, backed the ceasefire order in a famous speech in which he called the anti-Treaty fighters "the Legion of the Rearguard", saying that "the republic can no longer be successfully defended by your arms [[...]] Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic". {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} After this point many of the republicans were arrested in Free state "round ups" when they had come out of hiding and returned home. De Valera was arrested in [[County Clare]] and [[internment|interned]] until 1924.

==Founding of Fianna F<U+00E1>il and entry into Free State D<U+00E1>il==
After the IRA dumped their arms rather than surrender them or continue a now fruitless war, de Valera returned to political methods. In 1924 he was arrested in [[Newry]] for "illegally entering Northern Ireland" and held in [[solitary confinement]] for a month in [[Crumlin Road Gaol]], [[Belfast]]. After narrowly losing a vote of the [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] party to accept the Free State Constitution (contingent on the abolition of the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]]), de Valera resigned from the presidency of the party and in March 1926, with [[Se<U+00E1>n Lemass]], [[Constance Markiewicz]] and others, formed a new party, [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]] (''The Warriors of Destiny''), a party that was to dominate twentieth century Irish politics. The party made swift electoral gains but refused to take the Oath of Allegiance (spun by opponents as an 'Oath of Allegiance to the Crown' but actually an ''Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Free State'' with a secondary ''promise of fidelity to the King in his role in the Treaty settlement''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The oath was actually largely the work of Michael Collins and based on three sources: British oaths in the dominions, the oath of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and a draft oath prepared by de Valera in his proposed Treaty alternative, [[Document No.2]]). The party began a legal case to challenge the requirement that it take the Oath, but the assassination of the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Vice-President of the Executive Council]] (deputy prime minister) [[Kevin O'Higgins]] led the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] under [[W. T. Cosgrave]] to introduce a Bill requiring all D<U+00E1>il candidates to promise on oath that if they were elected they would take the Oath of Allegiance. Forced into a corner, and faced with the option of staying outside politics forever or taking the oath and entering, de Valera and his TDs took the Oath of Allegiance in 1927. De Valera never organised Fianna F<U+00E1>il in [[Northern Ireland]] and it was not until 7 December 2007 that Fianna F<U+00E1>il was registered in [[Northern Ireland]] by the [[UK Electoral Commission]].<ref name="rte-ukelcomm">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/1207/fiannafail.html|title=FF officially recognised in Northern Ireland|work=[[RT<U+00C9> News]]|date=7 December 2007|accessdate=8 December 2007}}</ref>

==President of the Executive Council==
In the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 general election]] [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]] secured 72 seats and became the largest party in the D<U+00E1>il, although without a majority. Some of its members arrived at the first sitting of the new D<U+00E1>il carrying arms. However the transition was peaceful. De Valera was appointed [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] ''(Prime Minister)'' by Governor-General [[James McNeill]] on 9 March. He at once initiated steps to fulfil his election promises of abolishing the oath and withholding land annuities owed to Britain for loans provided under the [[Irish Land Acts]] and agreed as part of the 1921 Treaty. This launched the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]] when Britain in retaliation imposed economic sanctions against Irish exports. De Valera responded in kind with levies on British imports. The ensuing "Economic War" lasted until 1938. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

On his advice the appointment of [[James McNeill]] as Governor-General was terminated by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] on 1 November 1932 and a 1916 veteran, [[Domhnall Ua Buachalla]], was appointed Governor-General in his place. Thus another symbol of monarchical authority was virtually removed. To strengthen his position against the opposition in the D<U+00E1>il and Seanad, de Valera called a [[Irish general election, 1933|general election in January 1933]] and won 77 seats, giving him an overall majority. Under his leadership, Fianna F<U+00E1>il won further general elections in [[Irish general election, 1937|1937]], [[Irish general election, 1938|1938]], [[Irish general election, 1943|1943]] and [[Irish general election, 1944|1944]].

De Valera took charge of Ireland's foreign policy as well by acting as his own Minister for External Affairs. In that capacity he attended meetings of the [[League of Nations]]. He was president of the Council of the League on his first appearance at [[Geneva]] in 1932 and, in a speech that made a worldwide impression, appealed for genuine adherence by its members to the principles of the Covenant of the league. In 1934, he supported the admission of the [[Soviet Union]] into the League. In September 1938 he was elected nineteenth president of the Assembly of the League, a tribute to the international recognition he had won by his independent stance on world questions. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

De Valera's government followed the policy of unilaterally dismantling the Treaty of 1921. In this way he would be pursuing republican policies and lessening the popularity of republican violence and the IRA. De Valera encouraged IRA members to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] and the Garda<U+00ED>. He also refused to dismiss from office those [[Cumann na nGaedhael]], Cosgrave supporters, who had previously opposed him during the Civil War. He did, however, dismiss [[Eoin O'Duffy]] from his position as Garda Commissioner after a year. Eoin O'Duffy was then invited to be head of the [[Army Comrades Association]] (ACA) formed to protect and promote the welfare of its members, previously led by J.F O'Higgins, Kevin O'Higgins brother. This organisation was an obstacle to de Valera's power as it supported Cumann na nGaedhael and provided stewards for their meetings. Cumann na nGaedhael meetings were frequently disrupted by Fianna F<U+00E1>il supporters following the publication of the article: ''No Free Speech for Traitors'' by [[Peadar O'Donnell]], an IRA member.

The ACA changed its name to the "National Guard" under O'Duffy. They adopted the uniform of black berets and blue shirts, used the straight armed salute and were nicknamed '[[The Blueshirts]]'. They were outwardly fascist and planned a march in 1933 through Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Kevin O'Higgins and Arthur Griffith. This march struck parallels with Mussolini's March on Rome (1922), in which he had created the image of having toppled the democratic government in Rome by staging a march. O'Duffy backed down when de Valera issued the threat that all members of the National Guard would be arrested by the specially employed troops, Broy's Harriers, named after Garda Commissioner [[Eamon Broy]]. Smaller local marches were scheduled for the following week. De Valera then banned the ACA/"National Guard" permanently in 1933. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==De Valera's new constitution==
During the 1930s, de Valera had systematically stripped down the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish Free State constitution]] that had been drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, Michael Collins. In reality, de Valera had been able to do that only due to three reasons. First, though the 1922 constitution originally  required public [[plebiscite]] for any [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] beyond eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a ''Constitutional Amendment Act'' through the [[Oireachtas]]. Secondly, while in theory the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could ''reserve'' or ''deny'' the [[Royal Assent]] to any legislation, in practice the power to advise the Governor-General so to do as and from 1927 no longer rested with the British Government in London but with ''His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State'', which meant that in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the Governor-General to block the enactment of one of its own bills. Thirdly, in theory the Constitution ''had'' to be in keeping with the provisions of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the fundamental law of the state. However, that requirement had been removed only a short time before de Valera gained power. Thus, with all the checks and balances that had been provided to ''preserve'' the Treaty settlement neutralised, de Valera had a free hand to change the 1922 constitution at will. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The Oath of Allegiance was abolished, as were appeals to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The opposition-controlled [[Seanad <U+00C9>ireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]], when it protested and slowed down these measures, was also abolished. And finally in December 1936, de Valera used the sudden abdication of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] as king of his various realms including ''King of Ireland'' to pass two Bills; one amended the constitution to remove all mention of the King and Governor-General, while the second brought the King back, this time through statute law, for use in representing the Irish Free State at diplomatic level. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1931, the British parliament had passed the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]'', which established the legislative equal status of the self-governing dominions of the British Empire, including the Irish Free State, and the United Kingdom. Though many constitutional links between the Dominions and the United Kingdom remained, this is often seen as the moment at which the Dominions became fully sovereign states. In July 1936, de Valera as constitutionally the King's Irish Prime Minister, wrote to King Edward in London indicating that he planned to introduce a new constitution, the central part of which was to be the creation of an office de Valera provisionally intended to call ''President of Saorst<U+00E1>t <U+00C9>ireann'', which would replace the governor-generalship. The title ultimately changed from ''President of Saorst<U+00E1>t <U+00C9>ireann'' (Uachtar<U+00E1>n Shaorst<U+00E1>t <U+00C9>ireann) to ''President of Ireland'' (Uachtar<U+00E1>n na h<U+00C9>ireann), but it still remained the central feature of his new constitution, to which he gave the new [[Irish language]] name ''Bunreacht na h<U+00C9>ireann'' (meaning literally the [[Constitution of Ireland]]). The text of the 1937 ''[[Constitution of Ireland]]'' is available<ref>[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Constitution%20of%20IrelandNov2004.pdf ''Constitution of Ireland'']</ref> as amended to 2004.

The constitution contained a number of reforms and symbols intended to assert Irish sovereignty. These included:
* a new name for the state, ''"[[<U+00C9>ire]]"'' (in Irish) and ''"Ireland"'' (in English);
* a claim that the national territory was the entire island of Ireland, thereby challenging Britain's [[Partition of Ireland|partition settlement]] of 1921;
* a new, popularly elected "[[President of Ireland]]" to replace the King of Ireland and his representative, the Governor-General;
* recognition of the "special position" of Roman Catholicism;
* a recognition of the Roman Catholic concept of marriage which excluded civil divorce;
* the declaration that the Irish language was the "national language" and the first official language of the nation although English was also included as "a" second official language;
* the use of Irish language terms to stress Irish cultural and historical identity (e.g., Uachtar<U+00E1>n, Taoiseach, T<U+00E1>naiste, Rialtas, D<U+00E1>il, Seanad, etc.); and

Criticisms of some of the above constitutional reforms include that:
* the anti-partition articles needlessly antagonised Unionists in [[Northern Ireland]], while simultaneously attracting criticism from hardline republicans by recognising the ''de facto'' situation.
* similarly, the recognition of the "special position" of the Catholic Church was inconsistent with the identity and aspirations of northern Protestants (leading to its [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|repeal in the 1970s]]),<!-- though the religious articles were praised by some Protestants and Irish Jews at the time  NOTE: NO PROOF OF THIS STATEMENT --> while simultaneously falling short of the demands of hardline Catholics and the Church for Catholicism to be explicitly made the state religion.
* the affirmation of Irish as the national and primary official language neither reflected contemporary realities nor led to the language's revival
* though the King was removed from the text of the constitution, he retained a leading role in the state's foreign affairs, and the legal position of the President of Ireland was accordingly [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|uncertain]]; there was also concern that the presidency would evolve into a [[dictator]]ial position
* elements of Catholic social teaching incorporated into the text, such as the articles on the role of women, the family and divorce, were inconsistent both with the practice of the Protestant minority and with contemporary liberal opinion

As Bew (2007) concludes, in the Constitution of 1937 he was "trying to placate left-wing Republicans with national phrases and pious people with expressly Catholic bits" and "patriarchal Catholicism."<ref>Paul Bew, ''Ireland: the politics of enmity, 1789-2006'' (2007), p. 455.</ref>

Ireland was [[Republic of Ireland Act|declared a Republic]] on 18 April 1949 by [[Taoiseach]], [[John A. Costello]]. The  state adopted an official description, the ''Republic of Ireland'' while keeping its name, ''Ireland''.<ref>From 1922 the name of the state was the [[Irish Free State]], which changed to Ireland in the 1937 Constitution.  See [[Names of the Irish state]].</ref> In doing so Ireland left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The last constitutional link to the [[Commonwealth realms|British Commonwealth]]{{mdash}} the Statute of Westminster's requirement that all countries in that organisation maintain the same individual as their respective monarch{{mdash}} had finally been cut, albeit not by de Valera's party.

==Catholic social policy==
He led his party Fianna F<U+00E1>il to adopt conservative social policies, since he believed devoutly that the Catholic church and the family were central to Irish identity. He added clauses to the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] (1937) to "guard with special care the institution of marriage" and prohibit divorce. His constitution also recognised "the special position" of the Catholic Church and recognised other denominations including the [[Church of Ireland]] and [[Jewish]] congregations, whilst guaranteeing the religious freedom of all citizens. He resisted an attempt to make [[Roman Catholicism]] the [[state religion]] and his constitution forbids the establishment of a [[state religion]]. His policies were welcomed by a largely devout, conservative and rural electorate.<ref name="ReferenceA">Bill Kissane, "Eamon De Valera and the Survival of Democracy in Inter-war Ireland", ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 2007 42(2): 213-226</ref> The unenforcable articles in the constitution which reinforced the traditional view that a woman's place was in the home further illustrate the direction in which Ireland was moving. An act of 1935 prohibited the importation or sale of contraceptives. The most rigorous censorship laws in western Europe complete the picture.<ref>Louise  Ryan, "Constructing 'Irishwoman': Modern Girls and Comely Maidens", ''Irish Studies Review'' 1998 6(3): 263-272</ref>

The specific recognition of Roman Catholicism was deleted by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] (1973) and the prohibition of divorce was removed by the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] (1996). The [[Irish Supreme Court]] declared in 1973 that [[Contraception in the Republic of Ireland|the contraception legislation]] was repugnant to the Constitution and therefore invalid.<ref>BAILII: [http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/1973/2.html McGee v.

==Neutrality in World War II==
{{Main|Irish neutrality during World War II|The Emergency (Ireland)}}
By September 1939, a general European war was imminent. On 2 September, de Valera advised [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]] that neutrality was the best policy for the country. This policy had overwhelming political and popular support, though some advocated Irish participation in the War on the Allied side, while others, seeing "England's difficulty as Ireland's Opportunity", were pro-German. Strong objections to conscription in the North were voiced by de Valera.<ref>{{Cite web | title = IRELAND: Too Much Trouble | work = TIME | publisher = Time Inc. | date = 9 Jun 1941 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,795330,00.html | accessdate = 6 Sep 2010}}</ref>  The government secured wide powers for the duration of the Emergency, such as internment, censorship of the press and correspondence, and the government control of the economy.

However, de Valera did respond to a request from Northern Ireland for fire tenders to assist in fighting fires following the [[Belfast Blitz]].

De Valera sent a personal note of congratulations to [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] upon his declaration of the [[Azad Hind]] government in 1943,<ref>{{cite book|last=Chakravart|first= S.

This did some damage to Ireland, particularly in the United States - and soon afterwards de Valera had a [[The Emergency (Ireland)#The Emergency after the end of World War II|bitter exchange of words]] with [[Winston Churchill]] in two famous radio addresses after the end of the war in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Irish Public Service Broadcasting - 1940s: De Valera and Broadcasting|work=History of RT<U+00C9>|publisher=RT<U+00C9>|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1940s_a.html|accessdate=30 October 2008}}</ref>

==Post<U+2013>war period==
Having spent sixteen years in power, Fianna F<U+00E1>il was replaced in 1948 by the first [[First Inter-Party Government]] with compromise candidate [[John A. Costello]] as [[Taoiseach]] and the Declaration of Ireland as a republic, which left only partition. De Valera, as leader of the opposition, embarked on a world campaign to raise the issue of partition. At no time prior to or during World War II or afterwards did De Valera ever send the [[Irish Army]] over the border into [[Northern Ireland]] to end partition and bring about a ''de facto'' 32 county Republic. He visited the United States, Australia, New Zealand and India, and in the latter country, was the last guest of the Viceroy [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] before the handover of Indian independence.<ref>Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'', London: Arrow, 1993, p.639.</ref> In [[Melbourne]], Australia, he was feted by the powerful Catholic Archbishop [[Daniel Mannix]], at the centenary celebrations of the diocese of Melbourne.

In 1966, the Dublin Jewish community arranged the planting and dedication of the <U+00C9>amon de Valera Forest in Israel, near [[Nazareth]], in recognition of his consistent support for Ireland's Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_3_48/ai_64507455/pg_7/?tag=content;col1|title=The Jews of Ireland|last=Tracy|first=Robert|year=1999|publisher=bNet.com|pages=7|accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref>

Returning to Ireland, during the [[Mother and Child Scheme]] crisis that racked the First Inter Party Government, de Valera kept a dignified silence as Leader of the Opposition, preferring to stay aloof from the controversy. In 1951 de Valera was returned to power but without an overall majority. It was during this period that de Valera's eyesight began to deteriorate and he was forced to spend several months in the Netherlands where he had six operations. Fianna F<U+00E1>il was defeated again in the [[Irish general election, 1954|1954 general election]]. However, like the first coalition government, the second lasted only three years. At the general election of 1957, de Valera, then in his seventy-fifth year, won an absolute majority of nine seats, the greatest number he had ever secured. This was the beginning of another sixteen year period in office for Fianna F<U+00E1>il. A new economic policy emerged with the First Programme for Economic Expansion. In July 1957, in response to the [[Border Campaign (IRA)]], he ordered the [[internment]] without trial of Republican suspects, an action which did much to end the IRA's campaign. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

De Valera remained as Taoiseach until 1959, handing over power to [[Se<U+00E1>n Lemass]]. In the same year, he was elected [[President of Ireland]], as which he served until 1973. He was re-elected president in 1966 aged 84, still a world record for the oldest elected head of state.

In 1969, seventy three countries sent [[Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages|goodwill messages]] to [[NASA]] for the historic first lunar landing. These messages still rest on the lunar surface and de Valera's message on behalf of Ireland stated, "May God grant that the skill and courage which have enabled man to alight upon the Moon will enable him, also, to secure peace and happiness upon the Earth and avoid the danger of self-destruction."<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages|work=Press release|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=13 July 1969|url=http://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=28 December 2007}}</ref>

<U+00C9>amon de Valera died in Linden Convalescent Home, [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[County Dublin]] on 29 August 1975 aged 92. His wife, [[Sin<U+00E9>ad de Valera]], four years his senior, had died the previous January, on the eve of their 65th wedding anniversary. He is buried in Dublin's [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].

==Overview==
Ireland's dominant political personality for many decades, de Valera received numerous honours. He was elected Chancellor of the [[National University of Ireland]] in 1921, holding the post until his death. [[Pope John XXIII]] bestowed on him the [[Order of Christ (papacy)|Order of Christ]]. He received [[honorary degrees]] from universities in Ireland and abroad. In 1968 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS), a recognition of his lifelong interest in mathematics. He also served as a member of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] (for [[Down (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Down]] from 1921 to 1929 and for [[South Down (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|South Down]] from 1933 to 1937), although he held to the Republican policy of [[abstentionism]] and did not take his seat in [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]]. He retired from the Presidency in June 1973, having served for fourteen years, the longest period allowed under the Constitution. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

De Valera was criticised for ending up as co-owner of one of Ireland's most influential group of newspapers, [[The Irish Press|Irish Press Newspapers]], funded by numerous small investors who received no dividend for decades.<ref>Sunday Times, 31 October 2004 p3; RT<U+00C9> broadcast on 2 November 2004.</ref> De Valera is alleged by critics to have helped keep Ireland under the influence of Catholic conservatism,<ref>Tom Garvin ''Preventing the future; why Ireland was so poor for so long.'' (Dublin 2004) passim; ISBN 0-7171-3771-6</ref> though that is explained by the large role Catholicism has played in Irish history. De Valera rejected, however, fundamentalist Catholic demands by organisations like [[Maria Duce]] that Roman Catholicism be made the state religion of Ireland, just as he rejected demands by the Irish Christian Front that the [[Irish Free State]] support [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

<blockquote>De Valera<U+2019>s preoccupation with his part in history, and his need to explain and justify it, are reflected in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify what he saw as the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.<ref>[http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/ProcCI/2001/PC01/PDF/101C02.pdf "Obsessive Historian: <U+00C9>amon de Valera and the policing of his reputation" Murray, Patrick. December 2001]</ref></blockquote>

In recent decades his role in Irish history has no longer been unequivocally seen by historians as a positive one, and a biography by [[Tim Pat Coogan]] alleges<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat ''de Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' ISBN 0-09-995860-0 ISBN 978-0-09-995860-4</ref> that his failures outweigh his achievements, with de Valera's reputation declining while that of his great rival in the 1920s, Michael Collins, is rising. The most recent work on de Valera by historian [[Diarmaid Ferriter]] presents a more positive picture of de Valera's legacy.<ref>
{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/new-book-tries-to-reclaim-devs-legacy-1166836.html|title=New book tries to reclaim Dev's legacy|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=15 October 2007}}</ref>
[[Bertie Ahern]] described in a book launch,<ref>Ferriter, Diarmaid  Judging Dev: A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of <U+00C9>amon De Valera ISBN 1-904890-28-8</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=558&docID=3552|title=Speech by the Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, TD, at the Launch of ''Judging Dev, A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of <U+00C9>amon De Valera'' by Diarmaid Ferriter|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach|date=14 October 2007}}</ref> the achievements of de Valera's political leadership during the formative years of the state:
<blockquote>One of de Valera<U+2019>s finest hours was his regrouping of the Republican side after defeat in the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service of those who had served his predecessors, but made best use of the talent available.</blockquote>

A notable failure was his attempt to reverse the provision of the 1937 Constitution in relation to the electoral system. On retiring as Taoiseach in 1959, he proposed that the [[Proportional Representation]] system enshrined in that constitution should be replaced. De Valera argued that Proportional Representation had been responsible for the instability that had characterised much of the post war period. A constitutional referendum to ratify this was defeated by the people. One aspect of de Valera's legacy is that since the foundation of the state, a de Valera has nearly always served in D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann. <U+00C9>amon de Valera served until 1959, his son, [[Vivion de Valera]], was also a Teachta D<U+00E1>la (TD). [[<U+00C9>amon <U+00D3> Cu<U+00ED>v]], his grandson, is currently a member of the D<U+00E1>il while his granddaughter, [[S<U+00ED>le de Valera]] is a former TD. Both have served in ministries in the Irish Government. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In recent years historians have focused more on his failures, comparing him unfavorable to his great rival Michael Collins. Critics complain that de Valera's duplicity and betrayal of the Treaty process, and his rejection of agreed upon democratic procedures led to civil war and nearly destroyed Ireland at birth, Liberals decry his conservative social policies and his close relationship with the Catholic bishops. He was morally certain to the point of arrogance with a keen eye for his own political self-preservation. Yet for all that, he remained a deeply committed republican, consistent in his dream of creating a truly Irish Ireland that the Gaelic revivalists of the early twentieth century would have approved. That he failed in this task remained perhaps his greatest disappointment. In his devout Catholicism, his rejection of material ostentation, his determination to revive the Irish language, and his inability to comprehend Protestant Ulster's fears of Catholic domination, historians portray de Valera as representative of his generation in southern Ireland.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Popular culture==
* De Valera was portrayed by [[Alan Rickman]] in the 1996 film ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'', which depicted the events surrounding Ireland's struggle for independence from Britain.
* In the 1990s [[RT<U+00C9>]] television show ''[[Nighthawks (TV show)|Nighthawks]]'', de Valera would sometimes emerge from a fridge at the back of the set and attempt to stop the interviews that were taking place. This deep-chilled portrayal was intended to symbolise his reputation as an austere figure at odds with modern Ireland. At one point, the de Valera character attempted to order a "Mick Collins" from a barman character - "one shot, then hit the road".
