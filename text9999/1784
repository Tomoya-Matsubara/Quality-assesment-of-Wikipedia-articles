'''"The Ones"''' is the [[List of 30 Rock episodes|nineteenth episode]] of the [[30 Rock (season 3)|third season]] of the American television comedy series ''[[30 Rock]]''.

The episode aired in the United States on April 23, 2009, on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC). Guest stars in this episode include [[Josh Casaubon]], [[Salma Hayek]], and [[Brian Williams]]. "The Ones" was Hayek's final appearance as Elisa.

In the episode, [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) goes shopping with [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) for an engagement ring for Elisa (Hayek). Jack grows worried about whether he and Elisa's potential marriage could survive in the real world, but [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) councils him on married life. Meanwhile, Elisa tells Liz that she is keeping a secret from Jack. A prank results in an injury back at ''TGS'' and [[Jenna Maroney]] ([[Jane Krakowski]]) falls in love with an attractive emergency medical technician (Casaubon) who comes to help.

"The Ones" received generally mixed reception. According to the [[Nielsen ratings]] system, it was watched by 6.3&nbsp;million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.9 rating/6 share among viewers in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic. For her performance in this episode, Krakowski received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination in the category for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress <U+2013> Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]].

==Plot==
[[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) is planning to marry his girlfriend Elisa ([[Salma Hayek]]) as he believes she is "[[wiktionary:the one|the one]]", but Elisa tells [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) she has a secret. She confesses to Jack and Liz that she killed her last husband in a [[crime of passion]] after he cheated on her, and did not go to prison because she could not get an impartial jury due to her consequent notoriety. Jack considers marrying her anyway, saying that love requires one to overlook another's flaws, but worries about what would happen if he would ever be unfaithful. [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) tells Jack that he has never cheated on his wife, [[Characters of 30 Rock#Angie Jordan|Angie]] ([[Sherri Shepherd]]), which makes Jack think that he too can be faithful. However, when Elisa grows too suspicious of Jack's relationship with Liz, he calls off the engagement.

Meanwhile, at the 30 Rock studios, [[Frank Rossitano]] ([[Judah Friedlander]]) and [[Toofer Spurlock|James "Toofer" Spurlock]] ([[Keith Powell]]) decide to play a prank on [[J. D. Lutz]] ([[John Lutz]]), which results in Lutz getting hurt, after a flat-screen monitor falls on top of him. [[Jenna Maroney]] ([[Jane Krakowski]]) becomes romantically interested in one of the paramedics ([[Josh Casaubon]]), but unsure of how to contact him, tries to bring him to the studio by giving the show's page, [[Kenneth Parcell]] ([[Jack McBrayer]]), strawberries, which triggers his allergies. Kenneth willingly consumes some, after Jenna tells him that the paramedic might be "the one", only for Jenna to decide against having a relationship with the paramedic because he has a son.

Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. [[IGN]] contributor Robert Canning rated the episode an 8 out of 10, saying it "gave all the main characters an opportunity to shine" and that the episode "delivered some great laughs and elevated some standard sit-com plots to a much funnier level." He argued that Liz helped make the episode good. Though, Canning found Elisa's secret disappointing and felt that Salma Hayek's exit from the show too much like a conventional [[sitcom]].<ref name="canning ign">{{cite news|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/976/976141p1.html|title=''30 Rock'': "The Ones" Review|accessdate=2009-07-07|last=Canning|first=Robert|date=2009-04-24|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Aly Semigran wrote that the episode gave good character revelations about Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth, but that episode did not exceed expectations from the previous week's episode, "[[Jackie Jormp-Jomp]]".<ref name="ew semigran" /> Writing for ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' Alan Sepinwall reported that despite the episode not being a ''30 Rock'' classic it "had more than enough funny things in it to keep me satisfied."<ref name="no classic" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nathan Rabin wrote that "The Ones" felt "a little stock" but that it was "just pretty good." He further added that "[[wiktionary:the one|the one]]" gag featured in this episode "was mildly amusing but a little obvious." He felt that Elisa's secret felt more like a [[Soap opera]] secret than a ''30 Rock'' one. Nonetheless, Rabin gave "The Ones" a B-.<ref name="obvious">{{cite news|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-ones,27099/|title= "The Ones"|accessdate=2010-03-17|date=2009-04-23|work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref> David Bauder of the ''[[Guelph Mercury]]'', however, was complimentary towards Hayek's guest appearances throughout season 3, noting, that they are "the best this absurdist comedy has to offer. Hayek throws herself into her role with gusto, matching Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin step for silly step".<ref>{{cite journal|first=David|last=Bauder|title=Hayek rocks right along with Fey and Baldwin|date=2009-04-25|work=[[Guelph Mercury]]|page=C2}}</ref>

Jenna's storyline in the episode received mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical,<ref name="canning ign" /> while Sepinwall reported it did not work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with [[Scott Adsit]]'s ''30 Rock'' character, [[Pete Hornberger]], as in this episode, "as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character.<ref name="no classic">{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Sepinwall|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/04/30_rock_the_ones_salma_hayek_r.html|title=30 Rock, "The Ones": Salma Hayek returns|accessdate=2010-03-16|date=2009-04-30|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]}}</ref> As with Sepinwall, [[Bob Sassone]] of [[AOL]]'s [[TV Squad]] believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but "it just went on too long and got tedious and silly." He believed it would be a good idea to have Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined "The Ones" did not choose that path.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/04/24/30-rock-the-ones/|title=''30 Rock'': "The Ones"|accessdate=2009-07-07|last=Sassone|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob Sassone|date=2009-04-24|publisher=[[TV Squad]]}}</ref> [[Tom O'Neil]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in an August 2009 article, was thrilled for Krakowski receiving an Emmy nomination for her work on ''30 Rock'', but felt that "The Ones" would not be the episode she win the Outstanding Best Actress award.<ref name="o'neil" />
