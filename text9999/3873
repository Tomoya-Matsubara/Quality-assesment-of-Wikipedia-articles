[[File:Bungar candi 120608-0343 krw.jpg|thumb|left|180px|From Karawang, West [[Java]] ]]
The Malayan krait may attain a total length of 108&nbsp;cm (about 3.5 ft), with a tail 16&nbsp;cm (6.3 in) long.

Dorsally, it has a pattern of 27-34 dark-brown, black, or bluish-black crossbands on the body and tail, which are narrowed and rounded on the sides. The first crossband is continuous with the dark color of the head. The dark crossbands are separated by broad, yellowish-white interspaces, which may be spotted with black. Ventrally, it is uniformly white.

The smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 15 rows, with the vertebral row much enlarged. The ventrals number 195-237; the anal plate is entire; and the single (undivided) subcaudals are 37-56 in number.<ref>[[George Albert Boulenger|Boulenger, G.A.]] 1896.
