'''Cameron Gordon''' is a [[Professor]] and Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair<ref>[http://www.ma.utexas.edu/people/faculty/#G Mathematics Faculty], Department of Mathematics, [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Accessed January 22, 2010. </ref> in the Department of mathematics at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], known for his work in [[knot theory]].  Among his notable results is his work with [[Marc Culler]], [[John Luecke (mathematician)|John Luecke]], and [[Peter Shalen]] on the [[cyclic surgery theorem]].  This was an important ingredient in his work with Luecke showing that [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]s were determined by their [[knot complement|complement]].  Gordon was also involved in the resolution of the [[Smith conjecture]].

[[Andrew Casson]]  and Gordon defined and proved basic theorems regarding strongly irreducible [[Heegaard splitting]]s, an important concept in the modernization of Heegaard splitting theory. They also worked on the [[slice knot|slice]]-[[ribbon knot|ribbon]] conjecture, inventing the Casson-Gordon invariants in the process.

Gordon was a 1999 [[Guggenheim Fellow]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/notices/199906/people.pdf  Guggenheim Fellowships Awarded.] [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], vol. 46 (1999), no. 6, p. 685  </ref>
In 2005 Gordon was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].<ref>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=194763&sectioncode=26 RSE fellows.] [[Times Higher Education]], March 18, 2005. Accessed January 22, 2010. </ref>
