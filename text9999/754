===Politics===
* Grammer is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and has expressed an interest in someday running for [[United States Congress]].<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,98169,00.html Transcript: Twenty Years of 'Frasier' from Fox News]</ref> 

* He was a celebrity guest at President [[George W. Bush]]'s first inauguration, along with [[The Rock (entertainer)|Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]] and [[Fred Thompson]].

* He endorsed [[Rudy Giuliani]] for president in 2008, before the candidate pulled out of the election and currently campaigns with Giuliani for [[John McCain]].

* Kelsey will star in the upcoming movie ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]'', a film whose plot is based in part on the recent tight races for President of the United States, in which the vote is so tight that it comes down to one man's vote to determine the winner.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=March 2008}}
* In addition to his other voice-over work, Kelsey's relaxed voice has also been featured in commercials.  He was the voice of the original [[GEICO]] gecko, a talking reptile created by [[The Martin Agency]] in 1999.  In the commercial, the gecko pleads for people to stop calling him in error, mistaking gecko for GEICO.  Since 2006, Grammer has provided the voice for television commercials advertising the [[Hyundai Sonata]], [[Hyundai Veracruz]], and the [[Hyundai Azera]].  He was chosen because his "refined and luxurious voice" would help build the up-and-coming car maker's new image as an affordable luxury automobile.

* Kelsey's name is parodied in the award-winning British comedy show "[[Little Britain]]" as "Kelsey Grammar School", a boys secondary school.

* Kelsey received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2001.
