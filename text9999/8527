'''Panamax''' and '''New Panamax''' are popular terms for the size limits for ships traveling through the [[Panama Canal]]. Formally, the limits and requirements are published by the [[Panama Canal Authority|Panama Canal Authority (ACP)]] titled "Vessel Requirements"<ref name="Vessel Requirements">[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/maritime/notices/n01-05.pdf by the [[Panama Canal Authority]]: ''Vessel Requirements''</ref>. These vessel requirements also describes topics like exceptional dry seasonal limits, propulsion, communications and detailed ships design.

The allowable size is limited by the width and length of the available [[canal lock|lock]] chambers, by the depth of the water in the canal and by the height of the Bridge of the Americas. Consequently, ships that do not fall within the Panamax-sizes are called '''Post Panamax'''. The limits have influenced those constructing cargo ships, giving clear parameters for ships destined to traverse the [[Panama Canal]]. 

"Panamax" is in effect since the opening of the canal in 1914. In 2009 the Canal management published the "New Panamax"<ref name="New Panamax publication">{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/common/maritime/advisories/2009/a-02-2009.pdf|title=Dimensions for Future Lock Chambers and <U+201C>New Panamax<U+201D> Vessels|author=Manuel E. Ben<U+00ED>tez, (ACP)|dateretrieved=02-05-2010|date=19-01-2009|publisher=ACP}}</ref>, that will be in effect when the [[Panama Canal expansion project|third lane of locks]], larger than the current two, are operational from 2014.

The increasing prevalence of vessels of the maximum size is a problem for the canal as a Panamax ship is a tight fit that requires precise control of the vessel in the locks, possibly resulting in longer lock time, and requiring that these ships transit in daylight. Because the largest ships traveling in opposite directions cannot pass safely within the [[Gaillard Cut]], the canal effectively operates an alternating one-way system for these ships.

==Panamax Dimensions==

Panamax is determined principally by the dimensions of the [[Panama Canal Locks|canal's lock chambers]], each of which is {{convert|110|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|1050|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|85|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} deep. The usable length of each lock chamber is {{convert|1000|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}. The available water depth in the lock chambers varies, but the shallowest depth is at the south sill of the [[Pedro Miguel Locks]] and is {{convert|41.2|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} at a Miraflores Lake level of {{convert|54|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}}. The height of the [[Bridge of the Americas]] at [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] is the limiting factor on a vessel's overall height.

The maximum dimensions allowed for a ship transiting the canal are:<ref name="Vessel Requirements"/>
;Length 
Over all (including protrusions): {{convert|950|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} 
Exceptions: 
* Container ship and passenger ship: {{convert|965|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} 
* Tug-barge combination, rigidly connected: {{convert|900|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} over all
* Other non-self-propelled vessels-tug combination: {{convert|850|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} over all
;Width ([[Beam (nautical)|beam]]): 
Width over outer surface of the shell plating: {{convert|106|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}
General exeption: {{convert|107|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}, when draft is less than  {{convert|37|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} Tropical freshwater.
;Depth ([[draft (hull)|draft]]): 
In tropical fresh water {{convert|39.5|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}. ACP uses the freshwater Gatun Lake as a reference. The salinity and temperature of water affect its density, and hence how deep a ship will float in the water. 
When the water level in [[Lake Gat<U+00FA>n]] is low during an exceptionally dry season the maximum permitted draft may be reduced.
;Air draft: 
{{convert|190|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} measured from the waterline to the vessel's highest point; limit also pertains to Balboa harbor.
Exception: {{convert|205|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} with passage at low water (MLWS) at Balboa is possible

All exceptions are typically allowed only after specific request, an investigation and on a one- or two-time only basis.

A Panamax cargo ship would typically have a [[deadweight_tonnage|DWT]] of 65,000-80,000 [[tonne]]s and a maximum cargo intake of 52,500 tonnes.<ref>[http://www.lr.org/Images/30%20ship%20sizes_tcm155-173543.pdf ''Modern ship size definitions''], from Lloyd's register</ref>

The longest ship ever to transit was the ''San Juan Prospector'', now ''Marcona Prospector'', an [[ore-bulk-oil carrier]] that is {{convert|973|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long, with a beam of {{convert|106|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://rainforest.montclair.edu/pwebrf/rainforest/Region/panama.html ''Background of the Panama Canal''], Montclair State University</ref> The widest ships to transit are the two [[North Carolina class battleship]]s, {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55}} and {{USS|Washington|BB-56}}, which have beams of {{convert|108|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}.<ref>''Battleships, United States Battleships in World War II'', by Robert O. Dulin, Jr. and William H. Garzke, Jr.; pages 62 and 145. Naval Institute Press, 1976. ISBN 0-87021-099-8</ref>

==Post-Panamax ships==
''Post-Panamax'' or ''over-Panamax'' denote ships larger than Panamax that do not fit in the canal, such as [[supertanker]]s and the largest modern [[container ships]]. The 'largest oil tanker in the world' - whichever ship held the title at the time - has not been able to transit the Panama Canal at least since the 'Idemitsu Maru' was launched in the 1960s; she was about 150,000 deadweight tons.  [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[supercarrier]]s are also in the post-Panamax class; the [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'' class aircraft carrier]]s are {{convert|1092|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}  long overall with a beam of {{convert|134|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}, while the flight deck is {{convert|252|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide.

==2006 Expansion plan and the New Panamax==
[[Image:Missouri panama canal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']], one of the {{Sclass|Iowa|battleship}}s, makes a very tight fit as she passes through the Miraflores Locks of the [[Panama Canal]] in October 1945.]]
[[Image:Panamax ship 1.JPG|left|thumb|Panamax car-carrier ship transiting the Panama canal. The hull construction, meant to maximize cargo capacity, also allows the ship to narrowly pass through the canal.]]
{{Main|Panama Canal expansion project}}
As early as the 1930s, [[History of the Panama Canal#The Third Locks Scheme|new locks were proposed for the Panama Canal]] to ease congestion and to allow larger ships to pass. The project was abandoned in 1942.

On October 22, 2006, the [[Panama Canal Authority]] (with the support of the Electoral Tribunal) held a [[referendum]] for Panamanian citizens to vote on the [[Panama Canal expansion project]]. The expansion was approved by a [[Panama Canal expansion referendum, 2006|wide margin]], with support from about 78% of the electorate. It is estimated that the project will be completed by 2014 and will cost $5.3 billion; this sum is expected to be recovered within 11 years.

===New Panamax===
The plans to build bigger locks have led to the creation of "'''New Panamax'''", based on new lock dimensions of {{convert|1400|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, beam {{convert|180|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and depth {{convert|60|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="New Panamax publication"/> [[Naval architect]]s and [[civil engineer]]s are already taking into account these dimensions for container ships.<ref>[http://www.manbw.com/files/news/filesof4672/Propulsion_trends_in_container_vessels.pdf Propulsion Trends in Container Vessels MAN B&W Two-stroke Engines]</ref> The world's largest cruise ship [[MS Oasis of the Seas|Oasis of the Seas]] has almost New Panamax dimensions with height difficult to pass under the [[Bridge of the Americas]] even at low tide.

After this expansion, the Panama Canal will be able to handle vessels of cargo capacity up to {{TEU|13,000|first=yes}}<ref>[http://www.rickmers-maritime.com/fleet/MAERSK%20EDINBURGH_RM.pdf "Maersk Edinburgh" 13,000 TEU container ship (Rickmers Maritime)]</ref>; currently, it can only handle vessels up to about {{TEU|5,000}}.<ref>[http://www.rickmers-maritime.com/fleet/MAERSK%20DJIBOUTI_RM.pdf "Maersk Djibouti" 5,000 TEU container ship (Rickmers Maritime)]</ref> A third set of locks <U+2013> {{convert|1400|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|180|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide, with a draft of {{convert|60|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} <U+2013> will supplement the two existing sets.

However, even before the revised dimensions were announced, the Maersk E-class - like the [[Emma Maersk]]; as well as many large tankers - [[Ultra Large Crude Carrier|ULCCs]]; and some bulk carriers, VLOCs - will not be able to pass through even the new, much larger locks.
