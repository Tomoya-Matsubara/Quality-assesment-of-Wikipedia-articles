'''''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised''''', also known as '''''Ch<U+00E1>vez: Inside the Coup''''' and '''''La revoluci<U+00F3>n no ser<U+00E1> transmitida''''' (Spanish title), is a 2003 documentary focusing on events in [[Venezuela]] leading up to and during the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|April 2002 coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt]], which saw President [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]] removed from office for several days. With particular emphasis on the role played by Venezuela's private media, the film examines several key incidents: the protest march and subsequent violence that provided the impetus for Ch<U+00E1>vez's ousting; the opposition's formation of an interim government headed by business leader [[Pedro Carmona]]; and the Carmona administration's collapse, which paved the way for Ch<U+00E1>vez's return. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' was directed by Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain. Given direct access to Ch<U+00E1>vez, the filmmakers intended to make a [[Reality television#Documentary-style|fly-on-the-wall]] biography of the president; they spent seven months filming in Venezuela, following Ch<U+00E1>vez and his staff and interviewing ordinary citizens. As the coup unfolded on 11&nbsp;April, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain filmed on the streets of the capital, [[Caracas]], capturing footage of protesters and the erupting violence. Later, they filmed many of the political upheavals inside [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]], the presidential palace.

Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain conceived of the film after Bartley returned from documenting the aftermath of the [[1999 Vargas mudslides]] for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, [[Bord Scann<U+00E1>n na h<U+00C9>ireann|Bord Scann<U+00E1>n na h<U+00C9>ireann]] (BS<U+00C9>), for a development grant. At BS<U+00C9>'s request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the <U+20AC>200,000 production was provided by BS<U+00C9> and several European broadcasters. Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain shot more than 200&nbsp;hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.

The film was positively received by mainstream film critics and won several awards. Reviewers cited the filmmakers' unprecedented proximity to key events and praised the film for its "riveting narrative";<ref name="schiller 488">Schiller (2009), p. 488.</ref> criticism focused on its lack of context and pro-Ch<U+00E1>vez bias. First shown on television in Europe and Venezuela in 2003, ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' later appeared at film festivals and secured a limited theatrical release on the art house circuit. Independent activists held unofficial screenings, and Venezuelan government officials encouraged its circulation to build support for Ch<U+00E1>vez's administration. The film is regularly shown on Venezuelan television, and in the capital it is often broadcast during "contentious political conjunctures".<ref>Schiller (2009), p. 494.</ref> ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' paints Ch<U+00E1>vez in a favorable light, which has led to disputes over its neutrality and accuracy; particular attention is paid to its framing of the violence of 11<U+2013>13&nbsp;April, the filmmakers' editing of the timeline, and the alleged omission of incidents and personnel. The film is alternately cited as an accurate portrayal or a misrepresentation of the events of April 2002.

==Background==
{{further|[[History of Venezuela]], [[Media representation of Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez#Coverage of the 2002 coup|Media representation of Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]]}}
Throughout much of the twentieth century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and military unrest. After [[Juan Vicente G<U+00F3>mez]]'s long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with [[Marcos P<U+00E9>rez Jim<U+00E9>nez]]'s overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes.<ref name="stoneman 5">Stoneman (2008), p. 5.</ref> Until 1998, the dominant political parties were [[Acci<U+00F3>n Democr<U+00E1>tica]] and [[COPEI]], who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during the second term in office for Acci<U+00F3>n Democr<U+00E1>tica's [[Carlos Andr<U+00E9>s P<U+00E9>rez]], Venezuela was hit by a severe economic crisis. A wave of protests known as the ''[[Caracazo]]'' engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.<ref name="stoneman 6">Stoneman (2008), p. 6.</ref>

[[File:Hugo Chavez in Brazil-1861.jpeg|right|240px|thumb|alt=tbc|Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez in 2003]]
[[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]], then a [[Military career of Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez|Lieutenant Colonel in the army]], had formed a secret revolutionary group ([[MBR-200]]) in the early 1980s and was planning a "rebellious intervention".<ref name="stoneman 6" /> He later felt the ''Caracazo'' was a missed opportunity for his movement.<ref name="stoneman 6" /> Three years later, Ch<U+00E1>vez saw another chance; in February 1992, he led an [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempts|unsuccessful military coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] and was imprisoned. A second coup attempt, without his involvement, also failed. Ch<U+00E1>vez enjoyed some popular support for his actions. Released from prison in 1994, he recast his revolutionary group as a legitimate [[socialism|socialist]] political party, the [[Fifth Republic Movement]].<ref name="stoneman 7">Stoneman (2008), p. 7.</ref> The movement adopted former Venezuelan leader [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] as its "iconic hero" and "reference point"; Bol<U+00ED>var had played a key role in Latin America's successful [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence from Spain]] in the 1820s.<ref name="stoneman 5" /> In the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1998|1998 presidential election]], Ch<U+00E1>vez won 56.2% of the vote, on a promise to "end the corruption of several decades" and institute a new [[Bolivarian Revolution]] that he felt would secure Latin America's true independence from the outside world.<ref name="stoneman 7" />

Ch<U+00E1>vez strengthened his support among the poor with a series of social initiatives known as the [[Bolivarian Missions]], and created a network of grass-roots workers' councils, the [[Bolivarian Circles]].<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 8.</ref> Nevertheless, by early 2002, Venezuela was "embroiled&nbsp;... in a severe political crisis" as Ch<U+00E1>vez sought to bring more of the country's vast oil wealth under state control.<ref name="gunson" /> Although the state-owned radio and television stations remained staunch advocates of Ch<U+00E1>vez's stated policies<U+2014>to redistribute the nation's wealth to the poorest<U+2014>the private media was more hostile.{{#tag:ref|According to Phil Gunson in ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', in Venezuela, "It is hard, if not impossible, to find an impartial observer. Most of the country's private news media have openly joined the opposition. State radio and TV are crude cheerleaders for the government."<ref name="gunson" />|group="nb"}} The crisis reached a head when Ch<U+00E1>vez attempted to remove the management of the state oil company, [[Petr<U+00F3>leos de Venezuela]] (PDVSA), provoking a showdown. "Oil managers, business leaders, and large segments of organized labor" called a general strike.<ref name="gunson" /> The strike was backed by a large segment of the population, "particularly the country's increasingly impoverished middle class" and army officers upset at the increasing politicization of the military.<ref name="gunson" />

On 11&nbsp;April 2002, hundreds of thousands of people marched in protest against the government. Abandoning their planned route, the marchers advanced towards the palace, a path that took them close to government supporters who had come out in opposition to the protest. Journalist Phil Gunson wrote, "Shooting broke out on all sides.  A score of civilians died and more than 150 suffered gunshot wounds. The military high command called for Ch<U+00E1>vez to resign, and at 3:20 the next morning they announced he had agreed to do so. The presidency was assumed by a business leader, [[Pedro Carmona]], but his government collapsed in less than forty-eight hours and Ch<U+00E1>vez returned to power."<ref name="gunson" />

==Production==
===Development===
In December 1999, independent Irish filmmaker Kim Bartley visited Venezuela as part of [[Concern Worldwide]]'s emergency response team, to document the aftermath of the [[1999 Vargas mudslides]] that had devastated much of [[Vargas State]] in the north of the country. Bartley become fascinated with how those affected by the tragedy perceived Ch<U+00E1>vez, and in late 2000,<ref name="stoneman 11">Stoneman (2008), p. 11.</ref> she and Donnacha <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain<U+2014>a filmmaker and former colleague who shared her "interest in Latin American politics and issues around globalization"<ref name="king">King, Michael (7 March 2003).

''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''.</ref><U+2014>spent two weeks in Caracas to determine the feasibility of a film project.<ref name="stoneman 11" /> The pair formed a production company, Runway Films, and in January 2001 applied to Ireland's film board, [[Irish Film Board|Bord Scann<U+00E1>n na h<U+00C9>ireann]] (BS<U+00C9>), for a development grant.<ref name="stoneman 12">Stoneman (2008), p. 12.</ref> Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain proposed a fly-on-the-wall documentary,<ref name="king" /> a "personal profile and intimate portrait" of Ch<U+00E1>vez<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 1.</ref> that would be "broadly supportive" of him.<ref name="stoneman 13">Stoneman (2008), p. 13.</ref> During their 2000 visit, the filmmakers had sensed that "something genuinely was happening" in Caracas,<ref name="stoneman 11" /> and felt an urgency to get the project underway; even so, it wasn't until April 2001 that BS<U+00C9> approved the <U+00A3>6000 (<U+20AC>9500) grant.<ref name="stoneman 12" />

The project was at this point named ''Al<U+00F3> Presidente'', a working title taken from Ch<U+00E1>vez's weekly television and radio program.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 4.</ref> BS<U+00C9> set about exploring avenues of funding;<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 14.</ref> the organization persuaded Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain to make a short pilot to show to potential investors,<ref name="stoneman 15">Stoneman (2008), p. 15.</ref> but refused the filmmakers' application for a <U+20AC>60,000 grant towards their <U+20AC>131,000 production budget. BS<U+00C9> felt the pair needed to partner with a production company that had experience in the field, and which could help raise the remaining funds. Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain approached Power Pictures and, with the addition of David Power as a producer, reapplied for the grant.<ref name="stoneman 15" /> Even as filming began, the full budget<U+2014>now at <U+20AC>200,000<ref name="stoneman 15" /><U+2014>had not been secured. David Power pitched the project at several documentary festivals and markets. At Dublin's Stranger Than Fiction festival in September 2001, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], [[S4C]] and [[Channel 4]] declined to invest. [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]] (RT<U+00C9>) expressed interest in providing development funds; no such deal was made, but RT<U+00C9> did offer <U+20AC>10,000 (subsequently <U+20AC>20,000) for the Irish broadcast rights. In October, the Dutch broadcaster [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting]] also committed <U+20AC>10,000. At a November market in Amsterdam, Power once again approached the BBC and was turned down, as the organization believed the film's subject was "too far away to be relevant to [its viewers'] lives".<ref name="stoneman 16" /> However, RT<U+00C9>'s Kevin Dawson pushed the film at a [[European Broadcasting Union]] pitching session, securing the interest of German television channel [[ZDF]], which subsequently provided funds.<ref name="stoneman 16">Stoneman (2008), p. 16.</ref> In late 2001, BS<U+00C9> finally approved a production grant of <U+20AC>63,000.<ref name="stoneman 17">Stoneman (2008), p. 17.</ref>

===Filming===
[[File:Entrada Miraflores.JPG|240px|thumb|alt=tbc|Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain captured much of their footage outside and inside the ''Palacio de Miraflores'' in Caracas.<ref name="king" /><ref name="chapter 8" />]]
In 2000, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain had been promised "exclusive access" to Ch<U+00E1>vez by the government's Minister of Communications.<ref name="stoneman 17" /> They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001.<ref name="gunson" /> While filming the pilot they met the president,<ref name="stoneman 17" /> after which they reconsidered their approach.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 18.</ref> Bartley explained, "We had&nbsp;... this notion of investigating Ch<U+00E1>vez<U+2014>was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here is a guy who is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began to see him as more transparent<U+2014>what you see is what you get."<ref name="stoneman 13" /> Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain began by attempting to build a relationship with Ch<U+00E1>vez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain finally got through to Ch<U+00E1>vez. They calculated that they needed to "press the right buttons" to gain his support, so they presented  him with an old edition of the memoirs of [[Daniel Florence O'Leary]], who had fought alongside Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 19.</ref> Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright [[Se<U+00E1>n O'Casey]].{{#tag:ref|"You cannot put a rope around the neck of an idea; you cannot put an idea up against the barrack-square wall and riddle it with bullets; you cannot confine it in the strongest prison cell your slaves could ever build."<ref name="stoneman 20" />|group="nb"}} Slowly, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain gained their subjects' trust, "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".<ref name="stoneman 20">Stoneman (2008), p. 20.</ref>

Although ensconced with Ch<U+00E1>vez and his entourage, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain felt a disconnect from the events of the outside world. During a "chaotic" road-trip with Ch<U+00E1>vez, they "knew something was coming", and divined that Ch<U+00E1>vez's trip was intended to bolster his support and "get people used to being on the streets".<ref name="stoneman 20" /> Ch<U+00E1>vez had recently "upped the ante" with the introduction of the Land Law.{{#tag:ref|Introduced in November 2001 as one of [[Enabling Act#In Venezuela|49 presidential decrees]], the Land Law aimed to increase the country's food production by breaking up and redistributing unused or underused land.|group="nb"}}<ref name="stoneman 20" /> Increasing tensions further, in February 2002, Ch<U+00E1>vez took control of PDVSA;<ref name="stoneman 30" /> the private media stepped up its criticism of Ch<U+00E1>vez, which for Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain "marked the beginning of an exciting phase".<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 21.</ref> By April 2002, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain were in Caracas and spent much of their time filming at [[Miraflores Palace|the presidential palace]], following Ch<U+00E1>vez and his staff.<ref name="king" /> As the 11&nbsp;April crisis unfolded, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain filmed outside the palace, first capturing footage of the demonstrations and subsequent violence,<ref name="chapter 8" /> then events inside the palace during the afternoon, evening and early hours of 12&nbsp;April. Through their previous contacts at the palace, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain were able to continue filming without interference: "no one paid any attention to us<U+2014>we just blended in."<ref name="king" /> Later that day, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety. Unable to leave the country<U+2014>the [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var International Airport (Venezuela)|international airport]] was closed<U+2014>the filmmakers instead took to the streets, "to document the repression [they] were witnessing".<ref name="king" /> At the same time, a press office cameraman was in the palace, "reluctant to lose his job despite the change in government".<ref name="king" /> He filmed the formation of the interim government. When Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain returned to the palace on 13&nbsp;April, the cameraman let them have his footage.<ref name="king" /> They remained filming in Venezuela until July 2002, interviewing residents<ref name="stoneman 22">Stoneman (2008), p. 22.</ref> and recording "witness" accounts from those who had been present during the coup<U+2014>ministers, security guards and journalists.<ref name="stoneman 26">Stoneman (2008), p. 26.</ref>

When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, ''El juego de Cuba'', so they hired its editor, <U+00C1>ngel Hern<U+00E1>ndez Zoido. Zoido approached the film as if it were entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored.<ref name="stoneman 23">Stoneman (2008), p. 23.</ref> He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the [[Dailies|rushes]] with Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain, Zoido asked them, "What do we want to tell in this scene?"<ref name="stoneman 24" /> He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core? Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.<ref name="stoneman 24">Stoneman (2008), p. 24.</ref>

The large amount of footage, and the fact that the filmmakers were "in a sense&nbsp;... looking at it for the first time", meant that the film's concept only became clear during editing.<ref name="stoneman 23" /> The events of 11<U+2013>13&nbsp;April gave it "a new dramatic centre",<ref name="stoneman 24" /> although Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain were keen that the film did not concentrate entirely on the coup. They had intended to include more historical and political context;<ref name="stoneman 24" /> it wasn't until late in post-production that the focus narrowed<ref name="stoneman 25" /> to include more emphasis on the media's role in Venezuelan politics.<ref name="stoneman 26" /> In October 2002, a two-hour "rough cut" was shown to Stoneman and Brendan McCarthy, BS<U+00C9>'s head of Production and Development.<ref name="stoneman 25" /> This version included the "witness" accounts that Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain had captured after April 2002. Stoneman felt that these sequences reinforced the film's claims, but "diluted its originality".<ref name="stoneman 26" /> He argued that they be cut, and that to compensate, Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain should record a voice-over and place themselves more in the frame as witness-protagonists, ideas that the filmmakers initially resisted.<ref name="stoneman 26" />

As editing progressed, budget shortfalls prevented BS<U+00C9> from finalizing contracts. The organization also restricted post-production funds to "limit [its] exposure" in the event the project was not completed.<ref name="stoneman 26" /> Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC, Nick Fraser,<ref name="stoneman 27">Stoneman (2008), p. 27.</ref> who had declined to help finance the film in 2001.<ref name="stoneman 16" /> Fraser was commissioning editor for the BBC's ''Storyville'' documentaries series. According to Stoneman, Fraser was "still undecided", having been told by the head of [[BBC Two]] that "we've done Ch<U+00E1>vez".<ref name="stoneman 27" /> Nevertheless, the BBC pre-purchased the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut.<ref name="stoneman 27" /> At the BBC's behest, the opening of the television version was made more dramatic. Fraser was unsure about the voice-over; he asked for a more "opinionated" narration that, according to Bartley, would "get the boot in".<ref name="stoneman 27" /> Although the BBC did not ask outright, Bartley's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be "against Ch<U+00E1>vez".<ref name="stoneman 27" /> Fraser later said he had asked for the filmmakers to "include [an interview] with someone not a Ch<U+00E1>vez supporter".<ref name="product" /> He also suggested that a more experienced director be employed to help edit the film. The filmmakers "made a few minor concessions", but resisted major edits.<ref name="stoneman 27" /> <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain's voice-over in the final cut was "polished up but not significantly changed".<ref name="stoneman 27" />

The filmmakers created two versions of the film. ''Ch<U+00E1>vez: Inside the Coup'', intended for television broadcast, lasts 52&nbsp;minutes. The feature-length ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' is 74&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="stoneman 29">Stoneman (2008), p. 29.</ref>

Among the viewers was the president of Vitagraph Films, David Schultz, who bought the rights for theatrical distribution and paid for the film to be converted from video. Schultz initially struggled to secure the support of exhibitors; they were skeptical of the film's commercial prospects, and believed "the environment was not hospitable" for a film critical of the US so close to the start of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref name="schiller 486-487" /> They only became receptive a few months later, when political perceptions shifted and the public became more aware of Venezuela because of its oil wealth.<ref name="schiller 486-487">Schiller (2009), pp. 486<U+2013>487.</ref> One such exhibitor was the [[Film Forum]] in New York City.

==Analysis==
===Disputed accuracy===
In Venezuela, debate about ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' is "often acrimonious".<ref>Schiller (2009), p. 480.</ref> The film has become key to framing people's understanding of the events of April 2002.<ref>Schiller (2009), p. 499.</ref> The previously accepted international view was that Ch<U+00E1>vez's ousting came from a "spontaneous popular response" to the repression of his regime; the film "directly contradicts" this position,<ref name="king" /> and since its release it has rapidly become "the prevailing interpretation of [the crisis]".<ref name="gunson">Gunson, Phil (May<U+2013>June 2004). "Director's cut: did an acclaimed documentary about the 2002 coup in Venezuela tell the whole story?". ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' '''43''' (1): 59<U+2013>61.</ref> The film's critics charge that it omits or misrepresents important events. Much of the criticism is centered on the filmmakers' "use of stock [documentary] devices", such as compositing clips from several events to present them as one incident.<ref name="schiller 485-486" /> Parallel editing also depicts sequences as if they occurred at the same time, when some of the footage was captured on different days.

Soon after the film's October 2003 broadcast on BBC Two, Venezuelan filmmaker Wolfgang Schalk began a campaign against ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'', representing ''El Gusano de Luz'' ("The Worm of Light"), an organization affiliated with the Venezuelan opposition. In July, Schalk had complained to RT<U+00C9> about its broadcast of the film.<ref name="stoneman 37" /> On 21&nbsp;October, ''El Gusano de Luz'' published a "detailed critique" as part of an internet petition<ref name="stoneman 47">Stoneman (2008), p. 47.</ref> that attracted 11,000 signatories, 85% of whom self-identified as Venezuelan.<ref name="stoneman 39-40">Stoneman (2008), pp. 39<U+2013>40.</ref> Directed at the European broadcasters that financed and aired the film,<ref name="disassemble" /> the petition said in part, "''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' is being presented as an author's film, as an objective journalistic research film, while it is really a very well plotted and accomplished propaganda operation, supported logistically by the Venezuelan government, with the aim of misleading unprepared spectators of countries who do not know the totality of events."<ref name="stoneman 39-40" /> The petition submitted 18 specific points of contention with the film.<ref name="stoneman 39-40" /> Venezuelan private television soon aired two programs "dissecting and denouncing" the film, and similar newspaper articles followed.<ref name="stoneman 38">Stoneman (2008), p. 38.</ref>

Much of the anger about the film stemmed from its high profile internationally;<ref name="stoneman 38" /> that it had been "blessed with the imprimatur of the BBC&nbsp;... with its connotations of fair and authoritative reporting" only made matters worse.<ref name="stoneman 39">Stoneman (2008), p. 39.</ref> John Burns, writing in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', restated many of Gunson's arguments,<ref name="stoneman 43-44">Stoneman (2008), pp. 43<U+2013>44.</ref> and the BBC received 4,000 e-mails demanding that ''Storyville''{{'}}s commissioning editor, Nick Fraser, be sacked.<ref name="product" /> Toward the end of 2003, the weight of criticism forced the BBC to act.<ref name="stoneman 43-44" /> The corporation's complaints unit opened an investigation, and Fraser said the BBC would not show the film again until it had concluded. He wrote to David Power expressing particular concern over an error with the end titles and the use of out-of-chronology footage, saying the latter was "a real problem<U+2014>particularly&nbsp;... since it has been used in a film dedicated to exposing the frauds of Venezuelan TV".<ref name="stoneman 43-44" /> The furore came at a difficult time for the corporation, which was under the spotlight of the [[Hutton Inquiry]], the official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]]; the BBC had been criticized for reporting that intelligence dossiers had been "sexed up" by the UK government to justify the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref name="product" />

The petition's claims were also taken up by the UK's independent telecommunications regulator, [[Ofcom]].<ref name="stoneman 47" /> The body investigated official protests made by several Caracas residents. The concerns largely focused on footage of the residents' attending a neighborhood meeting in June 2002, which was positioned in the film as a prelude to the April coup attempt. The residents said that the filmmakers had used footage of them without consent and that the film had misrepresented their views.<ref name="ofcom" /> In September 2005, Ofcom provisionally ruled that it had not upheld the complaints, citing the BBC's internal review and rebuttal as grounds.<ref name="stoneman 67">Stoneman (2008), p. 67.</ref> A subsequent appeal by the residents was unsuccessful.<ref name="ofcom" /> Two weeks after Ofcom's initial ruling, the BBC announced it had closed the complaint and that no further investigations would take place.<ref name="stoneman 67" /> Stoneman believed the BBC had overreacted, saying its guardedness was merely a product of being a frequent victim of press attacks on its ethos. Fraser said, "The film was very good in many respects, but also misleading."<ref name="product" /> He believed the filmmakers considered Ch<U+00E1>vez honorable, but having written a book on [[Peronism]] was more skeptical himself. Fraser concluded, "I still think it<U+2019>s a good film, because of the coup sequence. It should be seen as a Venezuelan ''[[The West Wing|West Wing]]''<U+2014>biased, of course, but highly entertaining."<ref name="product" />

===Responsibility for violence===
One of the film's key contentions is that the private media aired footage selectively to make it look like the violence of 11&nbsp;April was caused by Ch<U+00E1>vez's supporters, portraying them as an "irrational and uncivilized mob".<ref name="schiller 479">Schiller (2009), p. 479.</ref> Private television repeatedly showed Ch<U+00E1>vez's supporters on Puente Llaguno bridge as they shot at Baralt Avenue below, an area purportedly full of opposition marchers.<ref name="gunson" /> The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but not the people near them who were ducking to avoid being shot. It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue, claiming that "the opposition march had never taken that route" and that Ch<U+00E1>vez's supporters were only returning fire.<ref name="chapter 8" /> Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation, pointing out that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon, and taking issue with the implication that "coup plotters" were the shooters.<ref name="gunson" /> In response, the filmmakers say, "Nowhere in the film did we say that only [Ch<U+00E1>vez's supporters] were shot&nbsp;... Nobody can say with certainty who orchestrated the shootings."<ref name="respond" /> Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day, citing an "analysis of the shadows" by Schalk,<ref name="gunson" /> who created a counter-documentary, ''[[X-Ray of a Lie]]'', to examine ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' "scene by scene to uncover [its] narrative strategies and use of artifice".<ref name="schiller 485" /> Brian A. Nelson, in his book  ''The Silence and the Scorpion'', agreed with the analysis, claiming that Baralt Avenue was not as empty as the film portrays and that the filmmakers "put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there".<ref name="nelson">Nelson, Brian A.. ''The Silence and the Scorpion: The Coup Against Chavez and the Making of Modern Venezuela''. [[Nation Books]]. p.&nbsp;265. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/978-1568584188|978-1568584188]].</ref> Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge, citing eyewitness statements<U+2014>including one from ''[[Le Monde|Le Monde Diplomatique]]''{{'}}s deputy editor<U+2014>and an Australian documentary, ''Anatomy of a Coup'', that "came to conclusions similar to our own".<ref name="respond" /> A Venezuelan documentary, ''[[Puente Llaguno: Claves de una Masacre]]'', also supported Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain's view.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 55.</ref>

===Timeline and media depictions===
Other issues of contention include the lack of historical context; the film does not cover some of the events leading up to Ch<U+00E1>vez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered "how to defend themselves against possible&nbsp;... attacks" from Ch<U+00E1>vez's supporters.<ref name="gunson" /> In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held "long before" the events of April 2002.<ref name="respond" /> Responding to the critique, the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 51.</ref> Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor [[Freddy Bernal]] as he sings to a happy group of Ch<U+00E1>vez supporters in front of the palace. Later images of a "differently dressed Bernal" reveal that the footage was from another day.<ref name="gunson" /> Similarly, Gunson says that until shot at, "The opposition march was entirely peaceful."<ref name="gunson" /> The film presents footage of its "violent finale"<U+2014>including an image from another day<U+2014>as if it occurred during the protest's approach to the palace, accompanied by the narrated claim that "some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight".<ref name="gunson" /> Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain admit that they included a "limited" amount of archive footage,<ref name="respond" /> but say it was a "legitimate reconstruction"<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 48.</ref> to build context "before the core narrative of the coup [took] off" as they "could not be everywhere filming at all times".<ref name="respond" /> 

''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' claims that state television was "the only channel to which [Ch<U+00E1>vez] had access", but does not mention that during the violence he requisitioned "all radio and TV frequencies" to broadcast his two-hour address.<ref name="gunson" /> Private television circumvented the rules allowing this action by splitting the screen, showing Ch<U+00E1>vez's address on one side and footage of the violence on the other.<ref name="gunson" /> Ch<U+00E1>vez subsequently took television stations [[RCTV]] and [[Venevisi<U+00F3>n]] off the air.<ref name="estrenan">{{es icon}} Linzalata, Ernesto (31 July 2004).

''El Universal''.</ref> The film's assertion that VTV was taken over by opposition "plotters" is also disputed; according to ''X-Ray of a Lie'' and Gunson, staff left willingly.<ref name="gunson" /><ref name="estrenan" /> Gunson further alleges that footage of VTV's signal being cut<U+2014>mid-interview with a government legislator<U+2014>was fabricated.<ref name="gunson" /> Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain say they witnessed ministers' being unable to broadcast and that the [[International Federation of Journalists]] corroborated their claim that opposition forces took over VTV.<ref name="respond" /> The film also presents footage of armored vehicles around the palace, which Gunson says were there at the request of the president, not the opposition. He also challenges the film for presenting Ch<U+00E1>vez's supporters as "invariably poor, brown-skinned, and cheerful" and the opposition as "rich, white, racist, and violent".<ref name="gunson" /> He says that the opposition protests were multiracial and that armed government supporters "made the center of Caracas a no-go area".<ref name="gunson" /> Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain cite several commentators who uphold the claim that Ch<U+00E1>vez's supporters "were broadly poor and dark-skinned and the opposition broadly white and middle class", including Gunson himself in an April 2002 article in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.<ref name="respond" /> Gunson does agree that the film was right to point out that the private media "behaved disgracefully" by "systematically [excluding the pro-Ch<U+00E1>vez] viewpoint from print, radio, and TV" during the period of the coup.<ref name="gunson" />

Of greater concern, Gunson says, is the "deliberate blurring of responsibility for the coup".<ref name="gunson" /> The film presents the idea that the military commanders dispersed, "leaving a total power vacuum".<ref name="gunson" /> However, the high command's senior figure, General [[Lucas Rinc<U+00F3>n Romero|Lucas Rinc<U+00F3>n]] (who announced Ch<U+00E1>vez's resignation on television), was not part of the coup and remained in the government after April 2002.<ref name="gunson" /> The petition draws the conclusion, "(1) either General Rinc<U+00F3>n stated a truth that was accepted throughout the whole country&nbsp;... or (2) General Rinc<U+00F3>n lied, because he was an accomplice&nbsp;... that seems not to be the truth because he [remained in Ch<U+00E1>vez's administration]."<ref name="stoneman 56">Stoneman (2008), p. 56.</ref> Only one of the high command joined Carmona's interim administration before contributing to its downfall by withdrawing his support. The military leaders shown withdrawing their support for Ch<U+00E1>vez were not the high command, and Vice-Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez was not the head of the navy, as the film claims. Gunson says, "With one solitary exception, these generals and admirals had not 'fled abroad' after the Carmona government collapsed."<ref name="gunson" /> Although Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain accept that Rinc<U+00F3>n said Ch<U+00E1>vez "had agreed to resign",<ref name="stoneman 56" /> they reiterate that "elements in the military [threatened] force in the effort to make Ch<U+00E1>vez resign"; the filmmakers say it is "irrelevant" that the whole military did not join the coup, as this "is the case with most coups".<ref name="respond" /> General Rinc<U+00F3>n's announcement was omitted because they felt it was "supplementary to the main, key fact of the story",<ref name="gunson" /> that no documentary evidence of the resignation exists.<ref name="stoneman 56" />

===''X-Ray of a Lie''===
Schalk investigated ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' for five months.<ref name="atrisk" /> The Federation of Venezuelan Movie Directors commissioned Schalk and producer Thaelman Urguelles to "produce a response",<ref name=Clark>Clark, AC (2009). ''The Revolutionary Has No Clothes: Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian Farce''. Encounter Books. p.&nbsp;91. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/9781594032592|9781594032592]].</ref> and in 2004 they created the documentary ''[[X-Ray of a Lie]]'', which set out to expose its "manipulation".<ref name=VenezuelanNets>De La Fuente, Anna Marie (15 June 2007). [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967029.html "Venezuelan networks tread lightly"]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.</ref> Schalk said the film "presented a distorted version of events&nbsp;... to fit a story that appeals to audiences".<ref name="atrisk" /> Schalk is affiliated with the Venezuelan opposition;<ref name="atrisk" /> Bartley and <U+00D3>&nbsp;Briain say that it is "not insignificant that Schalk has led the well-resourced campaign, linked to [the opposition], to discredit and suppress [the film]".<ref name="respond" />

===''Chavez: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised''===
In 2008, Stoneman published ''Chavez: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised <U+2013> A Case Study of Politics and the Media''. A book "of film studies rather than politics", it nevertheless looks in detail at the petition's arguments.<ref name="product" /> Stoneman "broadly absolves" the filmmakers; he concludes, "There were some relatively small examples of slippage in the grammar of the piece, but overall the film was made with honesty and integrity. Of the 18 objections made, 15, if not 17, were wrong. The filmmakers spent a long time assembling evidence to show why they<U+2019>d done what they<U+2019>d done in the film and mostly it<U+2019>s true."<ref name="product" /> Stoneman conceded that the filmmakers' ''[[cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]]'' approach meant that for wider historical and political context, viewers should look elsewhere. Stoneman received an "Executive Producer" credit on the film, which he explains as an unasked-for gratuity that came by virtue of his position as head of BS<U+00C9>.<ref name="product" />

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Among mainstream critics in the US and UK, the film received almost exclusively positive reviews.<ref name="meta">[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/revolutionwillnotbetelevised "Revolution Will Not Be Televised, The"].

Frank Scheck, writing in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', said the film presented an enthralling story that "resembles a taut&nbsp;... political thriller",<ref name="shenk">Shenk, Frank (1 April 2003). "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised". ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.</ref> and [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it a "remarkable documentary" full of "astonishing shots".<ref name="ebert">[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] (31 October 2003).

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.</ref> Both critics said the film was made so through the filmmakers' unique inside access to the events at the palace.<ref name="shenk" /><ref name="ebert" /> Ebert reserved criticism for the film's partiality, particularly the selective way in which Ch<U+00E1>vez's opponents were framed,<ref name="ebert" /> while Shenk faulted the lack of historical context; however, he said this was balanced by the film's "brevity and succinctness".<ref name="shenk" /> In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Scott Foundas wrote that the film was a "superior example of fearless filmmakers in exactly the right place at the right time", and likely the best of a string of documentaries that have shone the light on US involvement in South America.<ref name="foundas" /> He had praise for the camera work and editing, and said the film was a "startling record" that reached "another level" when events shifted to the presidential palace.<ref name="foundas" /> He cited these scenes<U+2014>along with those of the protesters' clashing<U+2014>as ones that "spark with a vibrant tension and uncertainty".<ref name="foundas">Foundas, Scott (10 July 2003).

[[J. Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said the film was a "gripping" account that did "an excellent job" of taking apart and presenting the footage of events, and said it was "nearly a textbook on media manipulation".<ref>[[J. Hoberman|Hoberman, J.]] (4 November 2003). [http://www1.villagevoice.com/film/0345,hoberman2,48373,20.html "Recall Sequel in Venezuela? Hugo Your Way, We'll Go Ours"]. ''[[The Village Voice]]''.</ref> Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Stephen Holden]] said the film was "a riveting documentary" that delivered "the suspense of a smaller-scale ''[[Seven Days in May]]''", citing the way in which it examined how television can be used to "deceive and manipulate the public".<ref name="holden" /> He reproached the film's uncritical depiction of Ch<U+00E1>vez, and how it hinted at CIA involvement without presenting any proof.<ref name="holden">[[Stephen Holden|Holden, Stephen]] (5 November 2003).

''The New York Times''.</ref> [[Ty Burr]] in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' called the film "our best chance" to find out what really happened on 11<U+2013>13&nbsp;April, but cautioned that the filmmakers' "pro-Ch<U+00E1>vez stance" meant that for wider context audiences should look elsewhere, as it left out too much of Ch<U+00E1>vez's record.<ref name="burr" /> Burr also said the film's attempt to make the US into a villain was ineffective. He said, "because [the filmmakers] view the chasm that divides Venezuela purely in the context of the Cold War and Latin American political instability, they downplay the class warfare that's exploding right in front of them."<ref name="burr" /> Nevertheless, Burr concluded that the film's narrow focus remained engrossing.<ref name="burr">[[Ty Burr|Burr, Ty]] (6 February 2004).

Desson Thomson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that the film successfully reproduced the "panic and fear" at the palace as events unfolded, saying it came across like a "raw, [[Costa-Gavras]]-style thriller" that was "worth watching down to the last thrilling minute".<ref name="thomson" /> He said that knowing how uncertain Venezuela's future was made the film even more powerful. Thomson believed the handheld video was put to good use, calling its "news-breaking immediacy&nbsp;... intoxicating".<ref name="thomson" /> He concluded, "''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' is an extraordinary piece of electronic history. And a riveting movie."<ref name="thomson">Thomson, Desson (12 December 2003).
