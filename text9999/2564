'''Russell Jay "Rusty" Kuntz''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|u<U+02D0>|n|t|s}}; born February 4, 1955) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) designated hitter and [[outfielder]]. He played for the [[Chicago White Sox]], [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Detroit Tigers]] between 1979 and 1985. He never appeared in more than 84 games in any season during his playing career. In the final game of the [[1984 World Series]], Kuntz hit a [[pop fly]] to the second baseman that became the deciding [[run batted in]] (RBI).

Kuntz grew up in Kansas and California, playing three sports in high school and community college. He went to the Division III World Series twice with [[California State University, Stanislaus]] before being selected by the White Sox in the 11th round of the [[1977 MLB Draft]]. After the 1984 season, Kuntz was unable to return to form the next year. He was demoted to the minor leagues early in the 1985 season and was out of professional baseball as a player shortly thereafter.

Since his playing career ended, Kuntz has worked with several MLB organizations, including the [[Houston Astros]], [[Seattle Mariners]], [[Florida Marlins]], [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. He has worked as an assistant to the general manager, minor league coach, roving instructor and major league base coach. Since 2012, he has served as the [[Coach (baseball)|first base coach]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]]. Rusty's name has attracted the attention of sportswriters because of its similarity to a [[cunt|vulgar phrase]].

==Early life==
Kuntz was born on February 4, 1955 in [[Orange, California]].<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Rusty Kuntz Statistics and History|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kuntzru01.shtml|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> He was born to Chet and Willie Kuntz. His father was a bricklayer who later became an auto mechanic. The family moved from Orange to [[Wichita, Kansas]] when Rusty was young, then moved to [[Paso Robles, California]] a few years later. He attended [[Paso Robles High School]] in California, where he played baseball, basketball, and football. He said that baseball was his least favorite of the three sports at the time and that he was drawn to basketball because of the game's pace.<ref name=SABR/>

Continuing his education, Kuntz attended [[Cuesta College]] and [[California State University, Stanislaus]]. At Cuesta College, Kuntz played center field on the baseball team, quarterbacked the football team and was the center on the basketball team. After hitting for .402 and .442 [[batting average]]s in two seasons at Cuesta, Kuntz's father encouraged him to focus on baseball.<ref name=SABR>{{cite web|last=McClary|first=Mike|title=SABR Baseball Biography Project: Rusty Kuntz|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/fd53f47c|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> At CSU Stanislaus, Kuntz played on two teams that went to the Division III World Series.<ref name=Royals>{{cite web|title=Rusty Kuntz #18|url=http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/team/coach_staff_bio.jsp?c_id=kc&coachorstaffid=117366|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref> He was later inducted into the university's Warrior Athletics Hall of Fame.<ref name=Warrior>{{cite web|title=Warrior Athletics Hall of Fame|url=http://www.warriorathletics.com/hof.aspx?type=class_induction&tab=halloffame|publisher=[[California State University, Stanislaus]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> Kuntz was drafted by the [[Chicago White Sox]] as the first pick in the 11th round of the [[1977 MLB Draft]].<ref name=Cube>{{cite web|title=1977 Baseball Draft - Round #11 [June-Reg]|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/draft/research.asp?Y=1977&R=11&P=June-Reg&PID=13995|publisher=The Baseball Cube|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref>

Kuntz played 51 games for the rookie-level [[Gulf Coast League White Sox]] in the 1977 season. He hit for .287 as the team finished first in the [[Gulf Coast League]] standings.<ref name=Minors>{{cite web|title=Rusty Kuntz Minor League Statistics & History|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=kuntz-001rus|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=GCL>{{cite web|title=1977 GCL White Sox|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=3936b82e|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> The next season, Kuntz was promoted to the [[Class AA]] team, the [[Knoxville Sox]]. He bypassed the Class A affiliate because the Knoxville center fielder was suffering from migraine headaches, and he won the starting center field position.<ref name=SABR/> He hit .263 for Knoxvile with 10 home runs in 113 games; the team was managed by [[Tony LaRussa]] for part of the season and won first place in the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]. Starting the 1979 season with Chicago's [[Class AAA]] affiliate, the [[Iowa Oaks]], Kuntz played 122 games, batted .294 and hit 15 home runs in 394 [[at bat]]s.<ref name=Minors/><ref name=Southern>{{cite web|title=1978 Southern League|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=85334f4d|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> 

==MLB playing career==

===Early career===
Kuntz stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m}} and weighed {{convert|190|lb|kg}} during his playing career. He batted and threw right-handed. Kuntz made his MLB debut with the White Sox on September 1, 1979. He spent all of the 1980 and 1981 seasons with the White Sox, but he was used sparingly, registering less than 120 [[plate appearance]]s in the two seasons combined.<ref name=BR/> He started 1982 in the minor leagues with the [[Edmonton Trappers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], hitting .269 with 7 home runs and 34 RBI in 193 at bats. He [[base on balls|walked]] 50 times in 249 plate appearances for Edmonton. He was called back up to the major league team near the end of that season.<ref name=SABR/>

He was traded to the [[Minnesota Twins]] in June 1983, with the White Sox receiving minor leaguer Mike Sodders in exchange. He was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for pitcher [[Larry Pashnick]] after the 1983 season.<ref name=Trades>{{cite web|title=Rusty Kuntz Trades and Transactions|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=kuntzru01|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> The Pashnick-Kuntz traded was prompted because future [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] outfielder [[Kirby Puckett]] was playing in the minor leagues for Minnesota's Class AA affiliate and was expected to quickly join the Twins as an impact player.<ref name=SABR/> In 1984 with Detroit, Kuntz had the best numbers of his career: a .286 average and a .393 [[on-base percentage]]. He appeared in a career-high 84 major league games that season, mostly as a pinch-hitter and outfielder.<ref name=BR/>

===1984 World Series===
In the fifth and deciding game of the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[San Diego Padres]], Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter [[Johnny Grubb]] with the bases loaded and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that [[Tony Gwynn]] was unable to see. Second baseman [[Alan Wiggins]] made the catch, but was unable to prevent [[Kirk Gibson]] from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely [[game-winning RBI]].<ref name=SABR/>

The [[1984 American League Championship Series]] and the ensuing World Series represented Kuntz's only career postseason appearances.<ref name=BR/> In a 2010 [[Baseball Prospectus]] article, Steven Goldman wrote that the 1984 Tigers were "a great team that relied on a lot of fluke elements... The club had no regular first baseman, no regular third baseman, and the primary left fielder hit .239/.302/.342 against right-handers. The club made up for this in part by getting terrific production out of role players like Ruppert Jones, Johnny Grubb, and Rusty Kuntz, players who wouldn't synch up again..."<ref name=BP>{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Steven|title=You Could Look It Up|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=10090|publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Later career===
Kuntz returned to the Tigers in 1985 but appeared in just five games (last on April 24, 1985) before being sent back to the minor leagues. After batting .222 for Detroit's AAA affiliate, the [[Nashville Sounds]], he was released by the Detroit organization. He signed with the [[Oakland Athletics]] a couple of months later, but he did not play any games with them.<ref name=SABR/> Kuntz retired as a player with 277 games played, a .236 career batting average, 5 home runs and 38 RBI.<ref name=BR/>

==Post-playing career==
Kuntz was out of baseball in 1986, working for the [[United Parcel Service]].<ref name=SABR/> He worked as a coach in the [[Houston Astros]] organization during the 1987 and 1988 seasons, then moved to the [[Seattle Mariners]]. With Seattle, he served as a first-base coach between 1989 and 1992.<ref name=Royals>{{cite web|title=Rusty Kuntz #18|url=http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/team/coach_staff_bio.jsp?c_id=kc&coachorstaffid=117366|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> Kuntz joined the [[Florida Marlins]] organization in 1993 as a minor league baserunning and outfield coach.<ref name=Royals/> He became the team's first-base coach after the 1994 season.<ref name=Calkins>{{cite news|last=Calkins|first=Geoff|title=Roving pitching instructor Williams new bullpen coach|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-10-15/sports/9410140599_1_marlins-hitters-bullpen-coach-job|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 15, 1994}}</ref> In 1997, Kuntz moved into a role as roving instructor with the Marlins organization. In August of that year he worked on defensive skills with [[Gary Sheffield]] when the major league slugger was struggling with injuries.<ref name=Sheff>{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=David|title=They're Watching Sheff Field|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-08-19/sports/9708190079_1_marlins-rusty-kuntz-dennis-cook|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=August 19, 1997}}</ref>

In late 2000, Kuntz decided not to return to his role as first-base coach and outfield instructor. Instead, he went back to his position as a roving instructor with the team, which allowed for more time to be spent with his family. At that time, Marlins players including [[Cliff Floyd]] and [[Mark Kotsay]] praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the [[stolen base]]s he had accrued. Floyd said, ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything. He tells me about every pitcher we're facing. He keeps me going when I'm down. You don't get that too often in this game. You're expected just to be strong, handle everything. But it ain't that easy sometimes. He's a players' man. He loves us."<ref name=SS>{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=David|title=Kuntz's Contributions Will Be Missed|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-09-06/sports/0009060101_1_rusty-kuntz-third-base-coach-triple-a-manager|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=September 6, 2000}}</ref>

Kuntz was dismissed from his position with the Marlins before spring training in 2002. The move was part of a mass firing of Marlins personnel in player development and scouting after the team's change in ownership. Kuntz, who was paid for the 2002 season in any case due to the terms of his contract, kept a job working on the grounds crew at the team's spring training site. He had performed ground crew duties at the site for several years in the offseasons.<ref name=cutup>{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=David|title=Kuntz a cut-up in new spring job|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-02-20/sports/0202200102_1_three-coaching-job-two-years-marlins|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=February 20, 2002}}</ref> Late in the 2002 season, the [[Atlanta Braves]] hired Kuntz as a roving instructor. After the season, he was hired by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] as a first-base coach.<ref name=PPG>{{cite news|last=Dvorchak|first=Robert|title=Pirates hire coach; Jewett back in AAA|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pirates/20021025bucs5.asp|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=October 25, 2002}}</ref> In October 2005, the Pirates offered minor league positions to Kuntz and fellow coaches [[Gerald Perry]] and [[Alvaro Espinoza]].<ref name=Hartford>{{cite news|title=Transactions|url=http://articles.courant.com/2005-10-04/sports/0510040139_1_announced-jeff-newman-bullpen-coach-base-coach|accessdate=February 16, 2014|newspaper=[[The Hartford Courant]]|date=October 4, 2005}}</ref> He spent the next two seasons coaching between the Class AAA [[Indianapolis Indians]] and the major league club.<ref name=Royals/>

==Personal==
Kuntz's son Kevin was drafted by the Royals in the [[2009 MLB Draft]] but he chose to play baseball at the [[University of Kansas]]. He  was selected again by the Royals in the 28th round of the [[2013 MLB Draft]].<ref name=Gier>{{cite web|last=Gier|first=Kathleen|title=Kuntz's son selected by KC in 28th round|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130607&content_id=50019602&notebook_id=50035298&vkey=notebook_kc&c_id=kc|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref> Kevin spent the 2013 season in the minor leagues at the team's rookie-level affiliate, the [[Burlington Royals]].<ref name=Kevin>{{cite web|title=Kevin Kuntz Minor League Statistics & History|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=kuntz-001kev|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref>

The coach's name has been the subject of some media coverage. A 2010 [[Bleacher Report]] article said that his name was "hands down the best name ever.
