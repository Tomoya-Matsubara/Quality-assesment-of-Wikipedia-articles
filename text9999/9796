'''Stasanor''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] '''<U+03A3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03C1>'''; lived [[4th century BC]]) was a native of [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]] in [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]] who held a distinguished position among the officers of [[Alexander the Great]].{{rf|1|strab_14}} 

==Stasanor, officer of Alexander==
He probably entered the service of that monarch after the conquest of [[Cyprus]] in [[333 BC]], but the first occasion on which his name is mentioned is during the campaign in [[Bactria]], when he was detached by Alexander with a strong force to reduce Arsames, the revolted [[satrap]] of [[Aria (region)|Aria]]. This service, in conjunction with [[Phrataphernes]], he successfully accomplished, and rejoined Alexander at [[Zariaspa]] in the autumn of [[328 BC]], bringing with him Arsames himself as a captive, as well as Barzanes, who had been appointed by [[Bessus]] satrap of [[Parthia]].{{rf|2|arr_3.29_4.7}} 

==Stasanor the Satrap==
As a reward for this exploit he obtained the satrapy of Aria, which was, however, soon after changed for that of [[Drangiana]], in the command of which he remained during the whole of Alexander's campaign in [[History of India|India]]. On the king's return, Stasanor was one of those who met him in [[Kerman Province|Carmania]] with a very opportune supply of camels and other beasts of burthen, but returned to resume the charge of his province when Alexander continued his march towards [[Fars|Persis]].{{rf|3|arr_4.18_6.27_29_curt_8.3}} In the first partition of the provinces after the death of Alexander ([[323 BC]]), Stasanor retained his former satrapy of Drangiana, but in the subsequent division at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]] ([[321 BC]]), he exchanged it for the more important government of Bactria and [[Sogdiana]].{{rf|4|diod_18.3_39_phot_82_92_just_13.4}} 

Here he appears to have remained in quiet for some years, taking no open part, so far as we are informed in the contest between [[Eumenes]] and [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]], though apparently inclined in favour of the former: but he secured the attachment of the native population by the justice and moderation of his rule, and thus established his power so firmly that Antigonus found it prudent to pardon his favourable disposition towards his rival, and left him in the undisturbed possession of his satrapy, [[316 BC]].{{rf|5|diod_19.48}} 

==Fate==
From this time his name does not appear again in history. [[Justin]] however explains that around 305 BCE [[Seleucus]] attacked and conquered Bactria, probably in a conflict with Stasanor or possibly his successor:

:"Seleucos made many wars in the Orient after the division of the Macedonian kingdom between allies. At the beginning, he took Babylon; from there, his strengths increased by victory, he took over the Bactrians. He then went to India, which, after the death of Alexander, had assassinated his prefects, as if shaking the burden of servitude" Justin XV.4 <ref>"Multa in Oriente post diuisionem inter socios regni Macedonici bella gessit. 11 Principio Babyloniam cepit ; inde auctis ex uictoria uiribus Bactrianos expugnauit. 12 Transitum deinde in Indiam fecit, quae post mortem Alexandri, ueluti ceruicibus iugo seruitutis excusso, praefectos eius occiderat." [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte15.html Justin XV.4]</ref>

==Connections==
He was a contemporary and compatriot of [[Clearchos of Soloi]] (born in the same city of Soli, in Cyprus), a [[Peripatetic|peripatetician]] philosopher who was seemingly involved in the foundation of the Bactrian city of [[Alexandria on the Oxus]].
