A '''galaxy''' is a massive, [[gravitation|gravitationally bound]] system that consists of [[star]]s, an [[interstellar medium]] of gas and dust, and [[dark matter]]. Typical galaxies range from [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarfs]] with as few as ten million<ref>{{cite web |date= [[May 3]], [[2000]] | url = http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-12-00.html | title = Unveiling the Secret of a Virgo Dwarf Galaxy | publisher = ESO | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}</ref> (10<sup>7</sup>) stars up to giants with one trillion<ref name="M101">{{cite web |date= [[February 28]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/hst_spiral_m10.html | title = Hubble's Largest Galaxy Portrait Offers a New High-Definition View | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}</ref> (10<sup>12</sup>) stars, all orbiting a common [[center of gravity]]. Galaxies can also contain a large number of [[Star system#Multiple star systems|multiple star systems]] and [[star cluster]]s as well as various types of [[interstellar cloud]]s.

Historically, galaxies have been categorized according to their apparent shape (usually referred to as their visual morphology). A common form is the [[elliptical galaxy]],<ref>{{cite news | first=Aaron | last=Hoover | title=UF Astronomers: Universe Slightly Simpler Than Expected | publisher=Hubble News Desk | date=June 16, 2003 | url=http://www.napa.ufl.edu/2003news/galaxies.htm | accessdate=2007-02-05 }}</ref> which has an [[ellipse]]-shaped light profile. [[Spiral galaxy|Spiral galaxies]] are disk-shaped assemblages with curving dusty arms. Galaxies with irregular or unusual shapes are known as [[Peculiar galaxy|peculiar galaxies]], and typically result from disruption by the gravitational pull of neighbouring galaxies. Such interactions between nearby galaxies, which may ultimately result in a galaxy merger, may induce episodes of significantly increased star formation, producing what is called a [[starburst galaxy]]. Small galaxies which lack a coherent structure may also be referred to as [[Irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]].<ref name="IRatlas">{{cite web | last = Jarrett | first = T.H. | url = http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/galmorph/ | title = Near-Infrared Galaxy Morphology Atlas | publisher = California Institute of Technology | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}</ref>

Although theoretical, dark matter appears to account for around 90% of the mass of most galaxies. But the nature of these unseen components is not well understood. There is also some evidence that [[supermassive black hole]]s may exist at the center of many, if not all, galaxies. These massive objects are believed to be the primary cause of [[active galactic nuclei]] found at the core of some galaxies. The [[Milky Way]] galaxy appears to harbor at least one such object within its nucleus.<ref name="smbh">{{cite web | author = D. Finley, D.

==Etymology==
The word ''galaxy'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term for our own galaxy, '''galaxias''' (''<U+03B3><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BE><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C2>'') or ''kyklos galaktikos'' meaning "milky circle" for the system's appearance in the sky. In [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] placed his son by a mortal woman, the infant [[Hercules]], on [[Hera]]'s breast as she was asleep, so that the baby would drink her divine milk and thus become immortal. Hera woke up while breastfeeding, and realized that she was nursing an unknown baby: she pushed the baby away and a jet of her milk sprayed the night sky, producing the faint band of light known as the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kone<U+00E3>n<U+02D8> | first = Lubom<U+00ED>r | url = http://www.udu.cas.cz/collegium/tintoretto.pdf | format=PDF | title = Emblematics, Agriculture, and Mythography in The Origin of the Milky Way | publisher = Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref>

The terms ''galaxy'' and ''Milky Way'' first appeared in the English language in a poem by [[Geoffrey_Chaucer|Chaucer]].
{{Quote|"See yonder, lo, the Galaxy<U+00EB><br />&nbsp;Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,<br />&nbsp;For hit is whyt."|Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''c.'' 1380.<ref>{{cite web

When [[William Herschel]] constructed his catalog of deep sky objects, he used the name "spiral nebula" for certain objects such as [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]]. These would later be recognized as immense conglomerations of stars, once the true distance to these objects was appreciated, and they would be termed "Island universes". However the word ''universe'' was understood to mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the
objects instead became known as galaxies.<ref>{{cite web | last = Rao | first = Joe |date= [[September 2]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050902_teapot.html | title = Explore the Archer's Realm | publisher = space.com | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}</ref>

==Observation history==
In 1610, [[Galileo Galilei]] used a telescope to study the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way and discovered that it was composed of a huge number of faint stars.<ref>{{cite web | author=J.

The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the [[nebula]]e visible in the night sky might be separate galaxies.<ref name="our_galaxy">{{cite web | last = Evans | first = J.

[[Image:M51Sketch.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Sketch of the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845]]
Towards the end of the 18th century, [[Charles Messier]] compiled a [[Messier object|catalog]] containing the 109 brightest [[nebula]]e (celestial objects with a nebulous appearance), later followed by a larger catalog of five thousand nebulae assembled by [[William Herschel]].<ref name="our_galaxy" /> In 1845, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] constructed a new [[telescope]] and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.<ref>{{cite web | last = Abbey | first = Lenny | url = http://labbey.com/Telescopes/Parsontown.html | title = The Earl of Rosse and the Leviathan of Parsontown | publisher = The Compleat Amateur Astronomer | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>

In 1917, [[Heber Curtis]] had observed the nova [[S Andromedae]] within the Messier object [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]]. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred within our galaxy. As a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the so-called "island universes" hypothesis that held the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Heber D.

In 1920 the so-called [[Great Debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the [[universe]]. To support his claim that M31 was an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in our own galaxies, as well as the significant [[Doppler shift]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Harold F. | last=Weaver | url = http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/rtrumpler.html | title = Robert Julius Trumpler | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref>

[[Image:Hubble Edwin1.gif|left|thumb|280px|Edwin Hubble at the 48-inch telescope on Palomar Mountain.]]
The matter was conclusively settled by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the early 1920s using a new telescope. He was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some [[Cepheid variable]]s, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite journal | author=E.

The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the [[Sun]] within it was carried out by William Herschel in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. Using a refined approach, [[Jacobus Kapteyn|Kapteyn]] in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15&nbsp;kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloging of [[globular cluster]]s led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70&nbsp;kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the center.<ref name="our_galaxy" /> Both analyses failed to take into account the [[extinction (astronomy)|absorption of light]] by interstellar dust present in the [[galactic plane]], but after [[Robert Julius Trumpler]] quantified this effect in 1930 by studying [[open cluster]]s, the present picture of our galaxy emerged.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Trimble | first = V. | title=Robert Trumpler and the (Non)transparency of Space | journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society | year=[[1999]] | issue=31 | pages=1479 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AAS...195.7409T | accessdate = 2007-01-08 }}</ref>

In the 1970s it was discovered in [[Vera Rubin]]'s study of the [[rotation curve|rotation speed]] of gas in galaxies that the total visible mass (from stars and gas) does not properly account for the speed of the rotating gas.

==Types and morphology==
{{Main|Galaxy morphological classification}}
[[Image:Hubble_sequence_photo.png|thumb|360px|Types of galaxies according to the Hubble classification scheme. An ''E'' indicates a type of elliptical galaxy; an ''S'' is a spiral, and ''SB'' is a barred-spiral galaxy.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}]]

Galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the [[Galaxy morphological classification|Hubble sequence]]. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type, it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as [[star formation]] rate (in starburst galaxies) or activity in the core (in [[active galaxy|active galaxies]]).<ref name="IRatlas" />

===Ellipticals===
{{main|Elliptical galaxy}}
The Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an [[ellipsoid]]al profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little [[interstellar matter]]. Consequently these galaxies also have a low portion of [[open cluster]]s and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead the galaxy is dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller [[globular cluster]]s.<ref name="elliptical">{{cite web | name = M.A. Barstow | year = 2005 | url = http://www.star.le.ac.uk/edu/Elliptical.shtml | title = Elliptical Galaxies | publisher = Leicester University Physics Department | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }}</ref>

The largest galaxies are giant ellipticals. Many elliptical galaxies are believed to form due to the [[Interacting galaxy|interaction of galaxies]], resulting in a collision and merger. They can grow to enormous sizes (compared to spiral galaxies, for example) and giant elliptical galaxies are often found near the core of large galaxy clusters.<ref>{{cite web |date= [[October 20]] [[2005]] | url = http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/galaxies.php | title = Galaxies | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref> Starburst galaxies are the result of such a galactic collision that can result in the formation of an elliptical galaxy.<ref name="elliptical" />

===Spirals===
{{main|Spiral galaxy|Barred spiral galaxy}}

Spiral galaxies consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type ''S'', followed by a letter (''a'', ''b'', or ''c'') that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms and the size of the central bulge. An ''Sa'' galaxy has tightly wound, poorly-defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an ''Sc'' galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region.<ref>{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Gene |date= [[March 6]], [[2000]] | url = http://casswww.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/Galaxies.html | title = Galaxies - The Spiral Nebulae

}}</ref>

In spiral galaxies, the spiral arms have the shape of approximate [[logarithmic spiral]]s, a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars. Like the stars, the spiral arms also rotate around the center, but they do so with constant [[angular velocity]]. That means that stars pass in and out of spiral arms. The spiral arms are thought to be areas of high density  or density waves. As stars move into an arm, they slow down, thus creating a higher density; this is akin to a "wave" of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars. The arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation and they therefore harbor many bright and young stars.

A majority of spiral galaxies have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure.<ref>{{cite journal | author=P. B.

===Other morphologies===
Peculiar galaxies are galactic formations that develop unusual properties due to tidal interactions with other galaxies. An example of this is the [[ring galaxy]], which possesses a ring-like structure of stars and interstellar medium surrounding a bare core. A ring galaxy is thought to occur when a smaller galaxy passes through the core of a spiral galaxy.<ref>{{cite journal | author=R. A. Gerber, S. A. Lamb, D. S. Balsara | title=Ring Galaxy Evolution as a Function of "Intruder" Mass | journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society | year=[[1994]] | volume=26 | pages=911 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994AAS...184.3204G }}</ref> Such an event may have affected the [[Andromeda galaxy]], and as a result it displays a multi-ring-like structure when viewed in [[infrared]] radiation.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher=Esa Science News |date=[[October 14]], [[1998]] | title=ISO unveils the hidden rings of Andromeda | url=http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/outreach/esa_pr/andromed.htm | accessdate=2006-05-24 }}</ref>

A [[lenticular galaxy]] is an intermediate form that has properties of both elliptical and spiral galaxies. These are categorized as Hubble type S0, and they possess ill-defined spiral arms with an elliptical halo of stars.<ref>{{cite web |date= [[May 31]], [[2004]] | url = http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/pr0419.html | title = Spitzer Reveals What Edwin Hubble Missed | publisher = Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics | accessdate = 2006-12-06 }}</ref> ([[Barred lenticular galaxy|Barred lenticular galaxies]] receive Hubble classification SB0.)

In addition to the classifications mentioned above, there are a number of galaxies that can not be readily classified into an elliptical or spiral morphology. These are categorized as irregular galaxies. An Irr-I galaxy has some structure but does not align cleanly with the Hubble classification scheme. Irr-II galaxies does not possess any structure that resembles a Hubble classification, and may have been disrupted.<ref>{{cite web | last = Barstow | first = M.A. | year = 2005 | url = http://www.star.le.ac.uk/edu/Irregular.shtml | title = Irregular Galaxies | publisher = University of Leicester | accessdate = 2006-12-05 }}</ref> Nearby examples of (dwarf) irregular galaxies include the [[Magellanic clouds]].

===Dwarf===
{{main|Dwarf galaxy}}
Despite the prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies in the universe appear to be dwarf galaxies. These tiny galaxies are about one hundred times smaller than the Milky Way, containing only a few billion stars. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only 100&nbsp;parsecs across.<ref>{{cite journal | author=S. Phillipps, M. J. Drinkwater, M. D. Gregg, J. B. Jones | title=Ultracompact Dwarf Galaxies in the Fornax Cluster | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | year=[[2001]] | volume=560 | issue=1 | pages=201<U+2013>206 | url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?id=doi:10.1086/322517 }}</ref>

Many dwarf galaxies may orbit a single larger galaxy; the Milky Way has at least a dozen such satellites, with an estimated 3&ndash;500 yet to be discovered.<ref>{{cite news | first=Kimm | last=Groshong | title=Strange satellite galaxies revealed around Milky Way | publisher=NewScientist | date=[[April 24]], [[2006]] | url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn9043 | accessdate=2007-01-10 }}</ref> Dwarf galaxies may also be classified as [[dwarf elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], [[dwarf spiral galaxy|spiral]] or [[dwarf irregular galaxy|irregular]]. Since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to large ellipticals, they are often called [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy|dwarf spheroidal galaxies]] instead.

==Unusual dynamics and activities==
===Interacting===
{{main|Interacting galaxy}}
The average separation between galaxies within a cluster is a little over an order of magnitude larger than their diameter. Hence interactions between these galaxies are relatively frequent, and play an important role in their evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange of gas and dust.<ref name="umda">{{cite web | url = http://www.astro.umd.edu/education/astro/gal/interact.html | title = Galaxy Interactions | publisher = University of Maryland Department of Astronomy | accessdate = 2006-12-19 }}</ref><ref name="suia">{{cite web | url = http://cosmos.swin.edu.au/entries/interactinggalaxies/interactinggalaxies.html?e=1 | title = Interacting Galaxies | publisher = Swinburne University | accessdate = 2006-12-19 }}</ref>
[[Image:Antennae galaxies xl.jpg|left|280px|thumb|The [[Antennae Galaxies]] are undergoing a collision that will result in their eventual merger (NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image)]]

Collisions occur when two galaxies pass directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars within these interacting galaxies will typically pass straight through without colliding. However the gas and dust within the two forms will interact. This can trigger bursts of star formation as the interstellar medium becomes disrupted and compressed. A collision can severely distort the shape of one or both galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.<ref name="umda" /><ref name="suia" />

At the extreme of interactions are galactic mergers. In this case the relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead they gradually merge together to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, as compared to the original galaxies. In the case where one of the galaxies is much more massive, however, the result is known as [[Galactic cannibalism|cannibalism]]. In this case the larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the [[Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]] and the [[Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy]].<ref name="umda" /><ref name="suia" />

===Starburst===

Stars are created within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant [[molecular cloud]]s. Some galaxies have been observed to form stars at an exceptional rate, known as a starburst. Should they continue to do so, however, they would consume their reserve of gas in a time frame lower than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years; a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the universe,<ref name="chandra">{{cite web |date= [[August 29]], [[2006]]  | url = http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/starburst.html | title = Starburst Galaxies | publisher = Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref> and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.<ref>{{cite conference | author=R.

Starburst galaxies are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and the appearance of newly-formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create [[H II region]]s.<ref>{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Gene |date= 2006-07-13 | url = http://casswww.ucsd.edu/public/tutorial/Starbursts.html | title = Starbursts & Colliding Galaxies | publisher = University of California, San Diego Center for Astrophysics & Space Sciences | accessdate = 2006-08-10
}}</ref> These massive stars also produce [[supernova]] explosions, resulting in expanding [[supernova remnant|remnants]] that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity come to an end.<ref name="chandra" />

Starbursts are often associated with merging or interacting galaxies. The prototype example of such a starburst-forming interaction
is [[Messier 82|M82]], which experienced a close encounter with the larger [[Messier 81|M81]]. Irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity.<ref>{{cite web | last = Keel | first = Bill |date= September, [[2006]] | url = http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/starburst.html | title = Starburst Galaxies | publisher = University of Alabama | accessdate = 2006-12-11

===Active nucleus===
{{main|Active galactic nucleus}}

A portion of the galaxies we can observe are classified as active. That is, a significant portion of the total energy output from the galaxy is emitted by a source other than the stars, dust and [[interstellar medium]].

The standard model for an [[active galactic nucleus]] is based upon an [[accretion disk]] that forms around supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core region. The radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the [[gravitational energy]] of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disk.<ref name="keel">{{cite web | last = Keel | first = William C. | year = 2000 | url = http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/agnintro.html | title = Introducing Active Galactic Nuclei | publisher = The University of Alabama | accessdate = 2006-12-06 }}</ref> In about 10% of these objects, a diametrically opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the core at velocities close to the speed of light.

[[Image:M87 jet.jpg|left|thumb|280px|A jet of particles is being emitted from the core of the elliptical radio galaxy [[Messier 87|M87]] (NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image)]]

Active galaxies that emit high-energy radiation in the form of [[x-ray]]s are classified as [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]] or [[quasars]], depending on the luminosity. [[Blazar]]s are believed to be an active galaxy with a [[relativistic jet]] that is pointed in the direction of the Earth. A [[radio galaxy]] emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets. A unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on the viewing angle of the observer.<ref name="monster" />

Possibly related to active galactic nuclei (as well as [[Starburst (astronomy)|starburst]] regions) are low-ionization nuclear-emission regions, or [[low ionization nuclear emission region|LINER]]s. The emission from LINER-type galaxies is dominated by weakly-[[ion]]ized elements.<ref name="heckman1980">{{cite journal | author= T. M.

==Formation and evolution==
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution}}
The study of galactic formation and evolution attempts to answer questions regarding how galaxies formed and their evolutionary path over the history of the universe. Some theories on this field have now become widely accepted, but it is still an active area of study in astrophysics.

===Formation===
Current cosmological models of the early Universe are based upon the [[Big Bang]] theory. About 300,000 years after this event, atoms of hydrogen and helium began to form, an event termed [[recombination]]. Nearly all the hydrogen was neutral (non-ionized), and readily absorbed light, and no stars had yet formed. As a result this period has been called the "[[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark ages|Dark Ages]]". It was from density fluctuations (or [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] irregularities) in this primordial matter that [[structure formation| larger structures]] began to appear. As a result, masses of [[baryon]]ic matter started to condense within cold dark matter halos.<ref>{{cite web | date = November 18, 1999 | url = http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~aas/tenmeter/proto.htm | title = Search for Submillimeter Protogalaxies | publisher = Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref>. These primordial structures would eventually become the galaxies we see today. 

Evidence for the early appearance of galaxies was found in 2006, when it was discovered that the galaxy [[IOK-1]] has an unusually high [[redshift]] of 6.96, making it the most distant galaxy yet seen.<ref>{{cite journal | last = McMahon | first = R. | title=Journey to the birth of the Universe | journal=Nature | year=[[2006]] | volume=443 }}</ref> While some scientists have claimed other objects (such as Abell 1835 IR1916) have higher redshifts (and therefore are seen in an earlier stage of the Universe's evolution), IOK-1's age and composition have been more reliably established. The existence of such early protogalaxies suggests that they must have grown in the so-called "Dark Ages".<ref>{{cite web | date = November 18, 1999 | url = http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~aas/tenmeter/proto.htm | title = Search for Submillimeter Protogalaxies | publisher = Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}</ref> 

The detailed process by which such early galaxy formation occured is a major open question in astronomy. Theories may be divided into two categories: top-down and bottom-up. In top-down theories (such as the Eggen<U+2013>Lynden-Bell<U+2013>Sandage [ELS] model), [[protogalaxy|protogalaxies]] form in a large-scale simultaneous collapse lasting about one hundred million years.<ref>{{cite journal | author=O. J. Eggen, D. Lynden-Bell, A. R. Sandage | title=Evidence from the motions of old stars that the Galaxy collapsed | journal=Reports on Progress in Physics | year=[[1962]] | volume=136 | pages=748 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962ApJ...136..748E }}</ref> In bottom-up theories (such as the Searle-Zinn [SZ] model), small structures such as [[globular cluster]]s form first, and then a number of such bodies accrete to form a larger galaxy.<ref>{{cite journal | author=L.

Once protogalaxies began to form and contract, the first [[halo star]]s (called [[Population III stars]]) appeared within them. These were composed almost entirely of Hydrogen and Helium, and may have been massive. If so, these huge stars would have quickly consumed their supply of fuel and became [[supernova]]e, releasing heavy elements into the [[interstellar medium]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=A. Heger, S.

===Evolution===
Within a billion years of a galaxy's formation, key structures begin to appear. [[Globular cluster]]s, the central supermassive black hole, and a [[galactic bulge]] of metal-poor [[Population II stars]] form. The creation of a supermassive black hole appears to play a key role in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added.<ref>{{cite news | title=Simulations Show How Growing Black Holes Regulate Galaxy Formation | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |date=[[February 9]], [[2005]] | url=http://www.cmu.edu/PR/releases05/050209_blackhole.html | accessdate=2007-01-07 }}</ref>

The evolution of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common during the early epoch, and the majority of galaxies were peculiar in morphology.<ref name="sa296">{{cite journal | first=Christopher J. | last=Conselice | title=The Universe's Invisible Hand | journal=Scientific American | pages=35-41 | date=February, [[2007]] | volume=296 | issue=2 }}</ref> Given the distances between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the [[interstellar gas]] and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars, similar to that seen in NGC 250<ref>{{cite journal | author=A. W.

Tanvir | title=The tidal trail of NGC 205? | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | year=[[2004]] | volume=351 | issue=4 | pages=L94-L98 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004astro.ph..6055M }}</ref> or the [[Antennae Galaxies]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Struck | first = Curtis | title=Galaxy Collisions | journal=Galaxy Collisions | year=[[1999]] | volume=321 | url=http://xxx.lanl.gov/html/astro-ph/9908269/homepage.html }}</ref>

As an example of such an interaction, the Milky Way galaxy and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130&nbsp;km/s, and, depending upon the lateral movements, the two may collide in about five to six billion years. Although the Milky Way has never collided with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of the Milky Way with smaller [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] is increasing.<ref>{{cite news | first=Janet | last=Wong | title=Astrophysicist maps out our own galaxy's end | publisher=University of Toronto | date=[[April 14]], [[2000]] | url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin/000414b.asp | accessdate=2007-01-11 }}</ref>

Such large scale interactions are unlikely. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged for the last few billion years, and the net rate of star formation also peaked approximately five billion years ago<ref>{{cite journal | author=Heavens, Panter,Jimenez and Dunlop|title=The star-formation history of the Universe from the stellar populations of nearby galaxies|journal=Nature|year=[[2004]]|volume=428|Issue=6983|pages=625-627|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403293}}</ref>.

===Future trends===
At present, most star formation occurs in smaller galaxies where cool gas is not so depleted.<ref name="sa296" /> Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, only produce new generations of stars as long as they have dense [[molecular cloud]]s of interstellar [[hydrogen]] in their spiral arms.<ref>{{cite journal | author=R.

The current era of star formation is expected to continue for up to one hundred billion years, and then the "stellar age" will wind down after about ten trillion to one hundred trillion years (10<sup>13</sup><U+2013>10<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;years), as the smallest, longest-lived stars in our astrosphere, tiny [[red dwarf]]s, begin to fade. At the end of the stellar age galaxies will be composed of [[compact object]]s: [[brown dwarf]]s, [[black dwarf]]s, cooling [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Eventually, as a result of [[relaxation time|gravitational relaxation]], all stars will either fall into central supermassive black holes or be flung into intergalactic space as a result of collisions.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pobojewski | first = Sally | date = January 21, 1997 | url = http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/9697/Jan21_97/artcl17.htm | title = Physics offers glimpse into the dark side of the universe | publisher = University of Michigan | accessdate = 2007-01-13 }}</ref><ref name="cosmic_battle" />

==Larger scale structures==
{{main|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Groups and clusters of galaxies}}
Deep sky surveys show that galaxies are often found in relatively close association with other galaxies. Solitary galaxies which have not significantly interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed have been found to be truly isolated. However, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and can still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other, nearby galaxies.<ref>{{cite web | last = McKee | first = Maggie | date = June 7, 2005 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7478 | title = Galactic loners produce more stars | publisher = New Scientist | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}</ref>

On the largest scale the universe is continually expanding, resulting in an average increase in the separation between individual galaxies. (See [[Hubble's law]].) Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the universe as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30&ndash;100 million K.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/galaxy_clusters.html | title = Groups & Clusters of Galaxies | publisher = NASA Chandra | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}</ref> About 70&ndash;80% of the mass in a cluster is in the form of dark matter, with 10&ndash;30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ricker | first = Paul | url = http://www.npaci.edu/enVision/v15.2/ricker.html | title = When Galaxy Clusters Collide | publisher = National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}</ref>

[[Image:Seyfert Sextet full.jpg|left|thumb|280px|[[Seyfert's Sextet]] is an example of a compact galaxy group. ''NASA Hubble Space Telescope image.'']]
Most galaxies in the universe are gravitationally bound to a number of other galaxies. These form a [[fractal]]-like hierarchy of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is the most common type of galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well as most of the [[baryon]]ic mass) in the universe.<ref>{{cite web | first=Michael | last=Dahlem | date=[[November 24]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mdahlem/sci/SCGs.html | title = Optical and radio survey of Southern Compact Groups of galaxies | publisher = University of Birmingham Astrophysics and Space Research Group | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Trevor | last=Ponman | date=[[February 25]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/research/groups.html | title = Galaxy Systems: Groups | publisher = University of Birmingham Astrophysics and Space Research Group | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}</ref> To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping. (See [[Virial theorem]].) If there is insufficient [[kinetic energy]], however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.<ref>{{cite journal | author=M. Girardi, G.

Larger structures containing many thousands of galaxies packed into an area a few megaparsecs across are called clusters. Clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy, known as the [[brightest cluster galaxy]], which, over time, tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass to its own.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Dubinski | first = John | title=The Origin of the Brightest Cluster Galaxies | journal=Astrophysical Journal | year=[[1998]] | volume=502 | issue=2 | pages=141-149 | url=http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~dubinski/bcg/ }}</ref>

[[Supercluster]]s are giant collections containing tens of thousands of galaxies, found in clusters, groups and sometimes individually.  At the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|supercluster scale]], galaxies are arranged into sheets and filaments surrounding vast empty voids.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bahcall | first = Neta A. | title=Large-scale structure in the universe indicated by galaxy clusters | journal=Annual review of astronomy and astrophysics | year=[[1988]] | volume=26 | pages=631-686 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988ARA&A..26..631B }}</ref> Above this scale, the universe appears to be [[isotropy|isotropic]] and [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneous]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=N.

The Milky Way galaxy is a member of an association named the [[Local Group]], a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately [[1 E22 m|one&nbsp;megaparsec]]. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group. Many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies.<ref>{{cite journal | last=van den Bergh | first=Sidney | title=Updated Information on the Local Group | journal=The Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | year=[[2000]] | volume=112 | issue=770 | pages=529-536 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000astro.ph..1040V }}</ref> The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the [[Virgo Supercluster]], a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered around the [[Virgo Cluster]].<ref name="tully1982">{{cite journal | author= R.

==Multi-wavelength observation==
After galaxies external to the Milky Way were found to exist, initial observations were made mostly using visible light. The peak radiation of most stars lies here, so the observation of the stars that form galaxies has been a major component of [[optical astronomy]]. It is also a favorable portion of the spectrum for observing ionized [[HII region]]s, and for examining the distribution of dusty arms.

The dust present in the interstellar medium is opaque to visual light.  It is more transparent to [[Far infrared astronomy|far-infrared]], which can be used to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html | title = Near, Mid & Far Infrared | publisher = IPAC/NASA | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref> Infrared is also used to observe distant, [[Redshift|red-shifted]] galaxies that were formed much earlier in the history of the universe.  Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for [[infrared astronomy]].
