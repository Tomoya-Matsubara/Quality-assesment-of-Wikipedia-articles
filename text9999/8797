'''''Night Mail''''' is a [[1936 in film|1936]] [[documentary film]] about a [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] [[England|Anglo]]-[[Scotland|Scottish]] mail train, produced by the [[GPO Film Unit]].  A poem by [[English people|English]] [[poet]] [[W. H. Auden]] was specially written for it, as was music by [[Benjamin Britten]].  The film was directed by [[Harry Watt]] and [[Basil Wright]], and narrated by [[John Grierson]] and [[Stuart Legg]].  It starred [[LMS Royal Scot Class|Royal Scot]] [[LMS Royal Scot Class 6115 Scots Guardsman|6115 ''Scots Guardsman'']].

As recited in the film, the poem's rhythm imitates that of the train's wheels as they clatter over the track sections, beginning slowly but picking up speed so that by the time the narration reaches the penultimate verse the narrator is speaking at a breathless pace. As the train slows toward its destination the final verse is taken at a more sedate pace.  The famous opening lines of the poem are "This is the Night Mail crossing the border / Bringing the cheque and the postal order".
