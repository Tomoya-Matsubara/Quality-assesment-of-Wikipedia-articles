'''HMS ''Astraea''''' (frequently spelled '''HMS ''Astrea''''') was a [[Royal Navy]] 36-gun [[Fifth rate]] [[Apollo class frigate|''Apollo'' Class]] [[frigate]], launched in 1810 at [[Northam]]. She participated in the [[Battle of Tamatave]] and in an inconclusive single-ship action with the French frigate [[French frigate Etoile|''Etoile'']]. ''Astrea'' was broken up in 1851.

==Indian Ocean==

''Astraea''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first deployment was to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] under Captain [[Charles Marsh Schomberg]]. Shortly after arrival, Schomberg was ordered to join the squadron of Captain [[Philip Beaver]] on the newly captured [[Mauritius]]. when Beaver sailed for the [[Seychelles]] in March 1811, Schomberg took command of the naval forces on the island. On 6 May 1811, a French squadron attempted to land at [[Grand Port]] and were chased off by a squadron under [[James Hillyar]]. Schomberg took command of Hillyar's squadron and pursued the French to [[Tamatave]] on [[Madagascar]]. During the [[Battle of Tamatave]] on 20 May, ''Astraea'' was heavily engaged and the British captured two French frigates: [[HMS Java (1811)|''Renomm<U+00E9>e'']]  and [[HMS Madagascar (1811)|''N<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>ide'']].

Beaver died in April 1813, and Schomberg moved to his flagship [[HMS Nisus (1810)|HMS ''Nisus'']]. Command of ''Astraea'' transferred to [[John Eveleigh]]. 

==''Astrea'' vs. ''Etoile''==

Returning to Europe in 1814, Eveleigh in ''Astraea'' sailed from Spithead with ''Volontaire'' and convoyed the latter to Lisbon. She was in the company of [[HMS Creole (1813)|''Creole'']] under the command of Captain Mackenzie, who was also the senior to Eveleigh. The two frigates then cruised off Palma for three or four days before making for Teneriffe and circumnavigated the Canary islands. They reached the coast of Africa at Senegal, watered at [[Gor<U+00E9>e]] then steered for the Cape Verde Islands, making the island of [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]] on the morning of 23 January 1814.

Off the [[Cape Verde Islands]] they encountered two frigates at anchor with some other vessels, one a large transport.           ''Creole'' fired about three broadsides and then ''Astraea'' ran between ''Creole'' and her opponent, lay alongside and poured in three broadsides that silenced the French frigate for a time. ''Astraea'' then made for the commodore's ship, crossed his bow and raked him. Unfortunately at this moment ''Astraea''{{'}}s wheel was shot away, both quarter masters were killed, and she fell off. With the muzzles of the enemy guns nearly touching the taffrail it was ''Astraea''{{'}}s turn to receive broadsides which took away her lower rigging, ripped up the deck and burst one of the carronades. With no damage forward she managed to get starboard to starboard exchanging broadsides at very close range when Eveleigh received a pistol shot below the heart. Two hours later her opponent put her helm up and sailed off. That evening the two British ships anchored in [[Porto Praya]] on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St. Jago]]. After repairs they searched in vain for the enemy before sailing to Sierra Leone. 

The French vessel turned out to be ''Etoile''. The close and bitter engagement badly damaged both ships and Eveleigh was among the nine dead on ''Astrea''. [[HMS Hebrus (1813)|HMS ''Hebrus'']] later captured ''Etoile''. Command of ''Astraea'' passed to Captain William Black.

==Fate==

Following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], ''Astraea'' spent seven years in reserve. In 1823 she was converted to be a [[hospital ship]], in which state she remained until she was broken up in 1851.
