'''Kenneth Royal "Kenny" Williams''' (born [[April 6]], [[1964]] in [[Berkeley, California]]) is a former [[outfielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] and the current [[General Manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]].

Williams graduated from [[Mount Pleasant High School (San Jose, California)|Mount Pleasant High School]] in [[East San Jose]], [[California]] in [[1982]]; while in high school, he excelled in [[American football|football]]. He also played football at [[Stanford University]] before leaving to become a professional [[baseball]] player. He played in the game featuring [[The Play]]

==Playing career==
Selected by the White Sox in the 3rd round of the [[1982 in baseball|1982]] amateur draft, Williams made his debut in [[1986 in baseball|1986]] and spent three years in Chicago, primarily as a [[center fielder]], before being traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] in [[1989 in baseball|1989]]. The Tigers waived him during the [[1990 in baseball|1990]] season, and he was claimed by the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. The Blue Jays then put him on waivers during the [[1991 in baseball|1991]] season, with Canada's other major league team, the [[Montreal Expos]], picking him up. Williams decided to quit playing baseball after being released by Montreal following the 1991 season. 

==Administrative career==
In November [[1992 in baseball|1992]], Williams rejoined the White Sox organization as a scout. Named special assistant to Sox chairman [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] in [[1994 in baseball|1994]], he spent some time as a studio analyst for Sox games on [[FSN (Fox Sports Net)|SportsChannel Chicago]] before becoming the team's director of minor league operations in [[1995 in baseball|1995]]. In [[1997 in baseball|1997]], he was named vice-president of player development, a position in which he remained until [[2000 in baseball|2000]].

In November 2000, Williams replaced [[Ron Schueler]] as the general manager of the White Sox; he hired popular former Chicago shortstop [[Ozzie Guillen]] as the team's manager in [[2003 in baseball|2003]]. Since becoming the White Sox GM, Williams has become known for his aggressive moves to bolster the Sox lineup. This reputation was strengthened following the [[2004 in baseball|2004]] season, when Williams completely made over the White Sox team by switching its on-field focus from home runs to pitching, defense, and speed. Accordingly, he acquired players which excelled in these areas, through free agent signings ([[Orlando Hernandez]], [[Dustin Hermanson]], [[Jermaine Dye]], [[A.J. Pierzynski]], [[Tadahito Iguchi]]), trades ([[Scott Podsednik]], [[Jose Contreras]], [[Freddy Garcia]]) and the farm system ([[Joe Crede]], [[Aaron Rowand]]). Williams' off-season maneuvers were reflected in an extremely successful [[2005 in baseball|2005]] campaign for the South Siders, one in which they held the best record in all of baseball for most of the year, finished with the best record in the AL to clinch their first AL Central Division title since [[2000 American League Division Series|2000]], their first [[American League]] pennant since [[1959 World Series|1959]], and their first [[2005 World Series|World Series]] since 1917.

On February 27, 2006, Williams lashed out at former [[White Sox]] first base man [[Frank Thomas (AL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]] in an interview with a [[Chicago]] television media outlet, in response to statements Thomas made about the [[White Sox]] organization. He referred to Thomas as "an idiot" and "selfish" and said no one in the White Sox organization would miss him.

In the offseason prior to the 2006 season, Williams set out to improve his world championship team further by acquiring pitcher [[Javier Vazquez]] from the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and slugger [[Jim Thome]] from the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. In addition, Williams was cognizant of the large role that the bench played under Ozzie Guillen and solidified it by trading for [[Rob Mackowiak]] and [[Alex Cintron]]. Despite these aggressive maneuvers, the White Sox were once again favored to win the 2006 World Series. However, they fell well short and finished in third place in the AL Central Division behind the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Minnesota Twins]], thereby not making the playoffs.

In the offseason before the [[2007]] season, Williams traded away [[Freddy Garcia]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and acquired prospects, [[Gavin Floyd]] and [[Gio Gonzalez]], in return.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2689303</ref> He  also signed vetran free agent [[Darin Erstad]] to a one year 1 million dollar contract<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2742793</ref>. Williams has also stated that the [[Chicago White Sox|team]] needs to get younger and improve their scouting.<ref>http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/cs-070126sox,1,6213557.story?coll=cs-home-headlines</ref><ref>http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/cs-070127soxbits,1,6165294.story?coll=cs-home-headlines</ref>
