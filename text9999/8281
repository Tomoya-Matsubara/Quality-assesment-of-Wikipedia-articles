{{about|the German World War II fighter pilot||Emil Lang}}
'''Emil "Bully" Lang''' (14 January 1909 <U+2013> 3 September 1944) was a [[Luftwaffe]] ''[[Flying ace]]'' during [[World War II]]. A flying ace or fighter ace is a [[military aviation|military aviator]] credited with shooting down five or more enemy [[aircraft]] during aerial combat.<ref>Spick 1996, pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> Lang was credited with 173 aerial victories<U+2014>144 on the Eastern Front, 29 on the Western Front<U+2014>and one Soviet [[torpedo boat]] sunk in 403 combat missions.<ref>Schaulen 2004, p. 68.</ref>

Posted to a fighter wing on the Eastern front, Lang claimed his first aerial victories in March 1943. He was credited with 72 victories in a three-week period, among them an unsurpassed total of 18 on 3 November 1943. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') on 22 November 1943 for his 119 victories to that time. By March 1944, his claims totaled 144, for which he received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') on 11 April 1944. Transferred to the Western front, he claimed his 150th victim during the [[Normandy Invasion]] on 14 June 1944. He scored his last three victories on 26 August 1944; on 3 September 1944, he was [[killed in action]] over Belgium.

==Early life==

Emil Lang was born on 14 January 1909 at [[Talheim, Heilbronn|Talheim]] in the [[Neckar]] region near [[Sontheim]] of [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]], Germany. He was a well-known [[track-and-field]] athlete who ran the [[Middle distance track event|middle distances]]. Prior to World War II, he qualified as a civil pilot and flew with [[Lufthansa]].<ref name="MacLean p203">MacLean 2004, p. 203</ref><ref name="Obermaier p64">Obermaier 1989, p. 64.</ref> Lang earned the [[nickname]] "Bully" from his 'bulldog-like' looks, characterized by his barrel-chested physique.<ref>Toliver and Constable 1998, pp. 295<U+2013>296.</ref>

==Career in the Luftwaffe==
Having served as a transport pilot since 26 August 1939 with the ''Fliegerhorst Kompanie'' (Airfield Company) at [[Gablingen]], Lang was 33 years old when he was accepted for fighter pilot training in 1942. He undertook courses at the ''Jagdflieger Vorschule 1'' (1st Fighter Pilot Preparation School) (3 July 1942 <U+2013> 14 August 1942) and ''Jagdfliegerschule 5'' (5th Fighter Pilot School) (15 August 1942<U+2013>5 January 1943).<ref name="MacLean p205">MacLean 2007, p. 205.</ref> He was then assigned to [[Jagdgruppe Ost]] (Fighter Group East) on 6 January 1943 and then to [[Jagdgeschwader 54]] (JG 54<U+2014>54th Fighter Wing) on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] on 11 February 1943.<ref name="MacLean p205"/><ref name="Toliver&Constable p247">Toliver and Constable 1996, p. 247.</ref><ref group="Notes">For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see [[Luftwaffe Organization]]</ref> Serving with 1./JG 54 (1st Squadron of the 54th Fighter Wing), ''[[Leutnant]]'' (Second Lieutenant) Lang was 34 and considered exceptionally old for a novice fighter pilot. His first three aerial victories were claimed in March 1943, and within a month he was transferred to 5./JG 54 (5th Squadron of the 54th Fighter Wing) of which he became ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' (Squadron Leader) on 20 August 1943.<ref name="Obermaier p64"/>

Before the year's end, Lang's kill tally stood at over 100 victories, with a remarkable 72 scored around [[Kiev]] in just three weeks during October and November 1943. This series of multiple victories included ten on 13 October 1943 and 12 (victories 61<U+2013>72) in three combat missions on 21 October 1943 ,which earned Lang his first of two references in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'', an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', the name of the unified [[armed forces]] of Germany from 1935 to 1945.<ref>Weal 2001, pp. 103<U+2013>104.</ref> Lang set an all-time world record of 18 aerial victories claimed from four combat missions in one day on 3 November 1943, making him [[aviation history]]'s leading [[ace in a day]].<ref name="Toliver&Constable p247"/> This achievement led to him appearing on the cover of the 13 January 1944 ''Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung'' (Berlin's Illustrated Magazine).<ref>Weal 1998, p. 72.</ref> Lang was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') after 119 aerial victories on 22 November 1943, followed three days later by the [[German Cross]] in Gold (''Deutsches Kreuz in Gold'').<ref name="Obermaier p64"/>

On 9 April 1944, ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (First Lieutenant) Lang was appointed ''Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n'' of the 9./JG 54 (9th Squadron of the 54th Fighter Wing) engaged in [[Defense of the Reich]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. He became the 448th recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') on 11 April 1944 after 144 aerial victories, all claimed on the Eastern Front.<ref name="Obermaier p64"/>

In June, Lang claimed 15 aerial victories, including his 150th&mdash;a [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] on 14 June 1944&mdash;and four [[P-51 Mustang]] fighters shot down in four minutes on 20 June 1944, plus another four P-51s on 24 June.<ref name="MacLean p203"/> ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) Lang was then made ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (Group Commander) of the II./[[Jagdgeschwader 26]] "Schlageter" (JG 26<U+2014>2nd Group of the 26th Fighter Wing) on 28 June 1944.<ref name="MacLean p203"/> On 9 July, he claimed three [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s (victories 160<U+2013>162), on 15 August 1944 two P-47s, and on 25 August 1944 three [[P-38 Lightning]] fighters in five minutes. He claimed three Spitfires in two missions for his final victories (victories 171<U+2013>173) on 26 August.<ref name="MacLean p203"/><ref name="Obermaier p64"/> Between 24 May and 28 August 1944, Lang had claimed 29 aerial victories on the Western Front, including nine P-51 Mustangs.<ref>Bowman 2007, p. 75.</ref> On 6 June 1944, his group was the first to reach 100 aerial victories over Normandy, earning him and his group a second and final reference in the ''Wehrmachtbericht'' on 30 August.<ref name="MacLean p204">MacLean 2007, p. 204.</ref>

==Death==
On 3 September 1944, Emil Lang was [[killed in action]] when his [[Focke Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190 A-8]] (''Werknummer'' 171 240<U+2014>factory number) "Green 1" hit the ground and exploded north of [[Saint-Trond]]. He had experienced mechanical trouble on the runway when he and the other aircraft of his flight took off at [[Melsbroek]] at 1.20 pm. Ten minutes later, Lang was still having difficulties raising his landing gear. Flying at an altitude of {{convert|200|m|ft}}, his [[wingman]], ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' Hans-Joachim Borreck, called out [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s to their rear. Lang broke upward, to the left. ''[[Leutnant]]'' Alfred Gro<U+00DF> saw Lang's Fw 190 diving in flames, its gear extended, but he lost sight of Lang when his own craft was hit and he had to bail out. Examination of both German and American records suggests that Borreck and Gro<U+00DF> misidentified their opponents. The P-51 Mustangs of the [[55th Fighter Group]]'s 338th Squadron intercepted a flight of three to six Focke Wulfs. [[Lieutenant]] Darrell Cramer took a high [[Deflection (military)|deflection shot]] at the Focke Wulf on the left, which fell upside down in a steep dive and crashed hard into the ground; this undoubtedly was Emil Lang.<ref>Caldwell 1998, pp. 343, 344.</ref>{{#tag:ref|According to Andrew Thomas, however, Emil Lang was shot down by [[Flight Lieutenant]] Terry Spencer of [[No. 41 Squadron RAF]] flying a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire XII]] from [[Lympne]].<ref>Thomas and Davey 2008, p. 28.</ref>|group="Notes"}}

On 28 September 1944, Lang's commanding officer, ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (Wing Commander) [[Josef Priller]], submitted a request for posthumous promotion to ''[[Major]]''. In describing Lang's character, Priller said:<ref name="MacLean p204"/>
<blockquote>Captain Lang is a fully matured character, serious and calm in his demeanor, yet definite and energetic when strength was needed. Very good attitude as an officer. Demands of himself first. He understands how to reach the men under his command correctly. Captain Lang possesses an exemplary concept of service, has initiative and talent for improvisation to a large degree, well rooted in the National Socialist ideas.<ref name="MacLean p204"/></blockquote>
The commander of the [[2nd Fighter Corps (Germany)|''II. Jagdkorps'']] (2nd Fighter Corps), ''[[Generalmajor]]'' (Major General) [[Alfred B<U+00FC>lowius]], concurred with the assessment. Despite these recommendations, Emil Lang did not receive a posthumous promotion to ''Major''.<ref name="MacLean p204"/>
