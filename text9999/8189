'''Season one''' of '''''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''''', an [[United States|American]] [[television series]] developed by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], began airing on [[October 16]],[[2001]] on [[The WB Television Network|The WB Television Network (The WB)]]. The first season recounts the early adventures of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] [[Clark Kent]] as he adjusts to life in the fictional town of [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]], during his teenage years before he becomes [[Superman]]. It comprises 21 episodes and concluded its initial airing on [[May 21]],[[2002]].<ref name="tvg">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=100398&more=ucepisodelist|title=Smallville Episodes <nowiki>|</nowiki> TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Season one regular cast members include [[Tom Welling]], [[Michael Rosenbaum]], [[Kristin Kreuk]], [[Annette O'Toole]], [[John Schneider (television actor)|John Schneider]], [[Sam Jones III]], [[Allison Mack]], and [[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]].

The season's stories focus on Martha and Jonathan Kent's (O'Toole and Schneider) attempts to help their adopted son Clark (Welling) cope with his [[Fictional extraterrestrials|alien]] origin and control his developing [[superhuman]] abilities. Clark must deal with the meteor-infected individuals that begin appearing in Smallville, his love for [[Lana Lang]] (Kreuk), and not being able to tell his two best friends, [[Pete Ross]] (Jones III) and [[Chloe Sullivan]] (Mack), about his alien nature. Clark also befriends [[Lex Luthor]] (Rosenbaum).

The episodes were filmed primarily in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], and [[post-production]] work took place in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Gough and Millar assisted the writing staff with week-to-week story development. "[[Villain of the week]]" storylines were predominant during the first season; physical effects, make-up effects, and [[computer generated imagery]] became important components as well. Limited filming schedules sometimes forced guest actors to perform physical stunts, and the series regulars were more than willing to do stunt work. Episode budgets ultimately became strictly regulated, as the show frequently ran over budget during the first half of the season. The [[Television pilot|pilot]] broke The WB viewership record for a debut series,<ref name="record" /> and was nominated for various awards. Although the villain of the week storylines became a concern for producers, critical reception was generally favorable and the series was noted as having a promising start.<ref name="Post" /><ref name="Conrad1" /><ref name="Morris" /><!--"having" a positive start as in the first few episodes, or should this read "being a promising start" to mean the entire season?-->

==Production==
===Writing===
Ground rules for story development were established at the outset. Part of the marketing pitch, "no flights, no tights" dictated that Clark would not wear the Superman costume, nor would he fly. After initial discussion of possible storylines, a second rule decreed that Clark could never directly kill anyone. This created a dilemma since Clark must be able to defeat the "bad guys" from week to week. A solution developed in later episodes with the introduction of the [[Belle Reve#Smallville|Belle Reve]] sanitarium (Belle Reve is a Federal [[prison]] for [[metahuman]]s and other supervillains in the comics).<ref name="Cool">{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|date=September 2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=36<U+2013>39|isbn=1840237955}}</ref>

After setting the ground rules, Gough and Millar conceived ideas that facilitated week-to-week story development. For example, kryptonite's role was expanded to include enhancement of the sins of the antagonist: instead of creating physical monsters, exposure to kryptonite would amplify their personal demons.<ref name="pilcom">{{cite video|title="Pilot" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|date=2002}}</ref> This was not treated as literally in the pilot and "Metamorphosis" as it was in later episodes.<ref name="Meta"/> In "Cool", it was "the 'cool' kid literally [becoming] cool, needing human body heat to stay alive".<ref name="Cool"/> After several episodes, the writers developed a story that would help establish the show as more than a "villain of the week" series.<ref name="Rogue">Simpson, Paul, pp.52<U+2013>55</ref> The ninth episode ("Rogue"), which took longer than usual to develop due to its divergence from the standard formula, became their first "true crime story" and demonstrated that ''Smallville'' could include more than kryptonite-powered villains.<ref name="Rogue"/>

"What if" episodes were another Millar-Gough concept used to generate first season storylines. These episodes posed underlying questions about Clark. Episodes would evolve from basic questions such as: "what if someone had a crush on Lana, and acted on that obsession"; "what if someone found out Clark's secret"; "what if someone else had Clark's powers?" These three questions developed into the episodes "Metamorphosis", "Rogue", and "Leech", respectively.<ref name="Leech">Simpson, Paul, pp.64<U+2013>67</ref> "Stray", episode 16, answered the question, "what if Clark had been adopted by the wrong parents and his powers were exploited?"<ref name="Stray"/> "X-Ray" director Mark Verheiden and the rest of the crew realized divergent, unrelated storylines were not the best way to create episodes for ''Smallville''. Verheiden believes "X-Ray" was the first episode that managed to bring all the side-stories together so that they affected characters other than Clark and Lana.<ref name="X">Simpson, Paul, pp.32<U+2013>35</ref>

"Hourglass" was one of the stories included in Millar and Gough's initial pitch to the network (at the time it was referred to as "Cassandra").<ref name="Hour">Simpson, Paul, pp.40<U+2013>43</ref> "Hourglass" was the first episode to present two, distinct stories: the vengeful [[serial killer]] and the [[second sight]]ed Cassandra. Two significant storylines in the same episode forced the writers to spend more time developing the episode.<ref name="Hour" /> Cassandra's "visceral vision" (as it was referred to in the script) of Lex's future was developed into color [[storyboard]]s to better illustrate to the filmmakers the "blood rain" described in the text.<ref name="Hour" />

When the filmmakers were dissatisfied with the initial drafts of episodes, specifically with the evolution of characters, they would rewrite events, or add scenes to re-establish the original vision. The character of Earl Jenkins ([[Tony Todd]]), intended to be a sympathetic villain, came across as "completely unlikable" in the original draft of "Jitters". The character suffers from over-exposure to kryptonite, causing massive [[seizure]]s; if Jenkins happened to grab someone, they could be shaken to death. Originally, the character is first seen banging on the door of LuthorCorp and killing a security guard during one of his seizures. To present a more favorable aspect to the audience, a scene in which Earl visits his infant child was added to show that he was not a "raving maniac".<ref name="Jit" /> Similar rewrites occurred with the characters Ryan James ([[Ryan Kelley]]) in "Stray" and Tyler Randall ([[Reynaldo Rosales]]) in "Reaper". In the original draft of "Stray", Ryan developed his telepathic abilities from exposure to kryptonite.<ref name="Stray">Simpson, Paul, pp.80<U+2013>83</ref>; to emphasize the show was not always about kryptonite-infected villains, the story was revised so that Ryan had his ability from birth. The network also expressed dissatisfaction with Ryan as a murderer, so the character was rewritten to be the "nice kid".<ref name="Stray" /> The character of Tyler Randall shared Earl Jenkins's issue: he was not sympathetic enough in the filmmakers' eyes; intended to be an escaped prisoner, he was rewritten to be "the world's deadliest nice guy".<ref name="Reap">Simpson, Paul, pp.84<U+2013>86</ref>

===Filming===
Production was set up in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], because the creators were looking for a "Middle America landscape", and Vancouver was a good substitute for Kansas.<ref name="genesis">Simpson, Paul, pp.8<U+2013>17</ref> David Nutter, the director of the pilot, was given 16 days for main unit filming, twice that of the normal timeframe.<ref name="metcom">{{cite video|title="Metamorphosis" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=Warner Bros. Television|date=2002}}</ref> Despite the extended schedule, it was still a short amount of time, and he shot the pilot primarily from storyboards created by Adrien Van Viersen.<ref name="pilot">Simpson, Paul, pp.20<U+2013>23</ref>

Millar developed most of the look for ''Smallville'' with the idea that Smallville should be the epitome of "Smalltown, USA".<ref name="pilot"/> Millar's design required existing buildings to be painted, built, and remodeled. The Kent farm is the home of the Andalini family, and their barn was used for the pilot before a new barn was built.<ref name="metcom"/> The new barn was one of the major additions to the sets of the episode "Metamorphosis". Production designer Doug Higgins and his crew built a fully functioning, three-story barn for the Kent farm on a converted [[soundstage]] in [[Burnaby, British Columbia|Burnaby]].<ref name="am cin">{{cite journal|author=Jean Oppenheimer|title=Young Man of Steel|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=88|issue=55|pages=54<U+2013>58|date=May 2007|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> For the pilot, the crew built only a loft, with a set of stairs leading up to it, inside the existing barn on the Andalinis's property.<ref name="Meta">Simpson, Paul, pp.24<U+2013>27</ref> To resemble the Andalinis's barn as closely as possible, Higgins had his crew locate 100&nbsp;year-old wood to match the look of the Andalinis' barn.<ref name="Meta"/> The episode "Hourglass" called for several scenes to take place at the [[White House]]. Instead of building their own set, the ''Smallville'' producers called [[John Wells (TV producer)|John Wells]], producer of the political drama television series ''[[The West Wing]]'', and obtained permission to use ''The West Wing'' set to film the vision of Lex's future.<ref name="Hour"/>
[[Image:Swangard stadium Burnaby.jpg|thumb|Swangard stadium was the location of the opening football sequence for "Hothead". The production crew brought in water towers for the sequence, which called for the game to be played at night in the rain.<ref name="Hot"/>]]
When the ''Smallville'' crew was not filming on one of the constructed sets, or on a [[sound stage]], they were shooting [[Filming location|on location]] at the surrounding Vancouver sites. During the filming of "Metamorphosis", Vancouver was holding a [[Farmers' market]], which proved beneficial to the ''Smallville'' crew, as "Metamorphosis" called for a similar event to take place in the episode. The market was on the verge of ending, so the filmmakers shot what wide-angle scenes they could at the time, and filmed a close up conversation between Whitney and Clark at the Andalinis' farm, weeks after the initial market shooting.<ref name="metcom"/> Other filming locations include Vancouver's [[Pacific National Exhibition]] and [[Burnaby, British Columbia|Burnaby's]] [[Swangard Stadium]]. The Pacific National Exhibit provided a storage silo for a scene in "Hourglass", which involved Harry Bollston ([[Eric Christian Olsen]]) attacking Martha Kent (O'Toole) in the Kents' corn silo.<ref name="Hour"/> "Hothead" director Greg Beeman, who had previously worked with Gough and Millar on ''[[The Strip (TV series)|The Strip]]'' and ''[[Martial Law (TV series)|Martial Law]]'', used Swangard Stadium, as a substitution for Smallville High Stadium, for the opening football scene that took place at night.<ref name="Hot">Simpson, Paul, pp.28<U+2013>31</ref>

When filming fell behind schedule, another director came in to assist the main unit director in finishing the episode. Greg Beeman assisted director Chris Long for the two "visceral visions of the future" that appeared in the episode "Hourglass".<ref name="Hour"/> "Jitters" was an episode with so many changes that its initial scheduling as the second episode of the season was pushed back to the eighth spot. By the time filming for "Jitters" was completed, three directors had worked on the project: Greg Beeman, Phil Sgriccia, and Michael Watkins; however, Watkins was given sole directing credit for the episode.<ref name="Jit">Simpson, Paul, pp.48<U+2013>51</ref>

===Effects===
A big part of the ''Smallville'' series relies on the effects they deliver, whether [[Computer-generated imagery|digital]], [[Stunt#Practical effects|physical]], or special [[Make-up artist|make-up]] [[Special effect|effects]]. The effects shots, part of the [[post-production]] work, are developed and added in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="an mag">{{cite journal|author=Evelyn Sheinkopf|title=Smallville: Visual Effects Fit for a Superhero|journal=[[Animation Magazine]]|volume=17|issue=3|pages=17|date=April 2003|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> David Nutter hired Thomas Special Effects to create digital cornfields for the pilot episode. After attempting to grow ten thousand stalks of corn in a greenhouse, which only grew two feet tall, Nutter was forced to rely primarily on digital corn. Faux corn was also flown in from [[Arizona]].<ref name="pilot"/> CGI supervisor Bill Millar created digital butterflies for a scene in Lana's bedroom, and all the insects Greg Arkin ([[Chad Donella]]) collected in the episode "Metamorphosis". Greg's insects had to be created digitally, because a green hue was needed to illustrate the kryptonite radiation in the insects.<ref name="metcom"/> After the opening credits, the a [[first-person narrative|first person]] view of someone, later revealed to be Clark, flying through Lana's open window and into her bedroom was created digitally. The effect was accomplished with stock footage, a sound stage and computer generated imagery. Stock footage shot from a helicopter, as it flew over several farms during the day, was used for the first person point of view. It was altered from day to night, and a CGI house was created in an empty field. Lana's bedroom as built on a soundstage, and CGI was used to create the illusion of someone traveling through her open window and stopping above her bed.<ref name="metcom"/>
[[Image:Small krypto poison.jpg|thumb|left|A green hue and raised veins in Clark's hand, created digitally, were used to help illustrate the effects of kryptonite poisoning]]
It was decided the effects of kryptonite poisoning on Clark, "Clark time", and the appearance of kryptonite when in the proximity of Clark would need to be illustrated in a way the audience could understand if they were not familiar with the character. Gough and Millar, after doing some research, learned the female audience was not aware of what was happening when Clark was exposed to kryptonite. Beginning with "Metamorphosis", whenever Clark was exposed to kryptonite, his veins would rise up and develop a green hue to illustrate the effect it was having. Close-up shots of Clark's hand were used for these scenes, and it was all created with digital animation.<ref name="metcom"/> Gough and Millar developed the idea that kryptonite would only glow when it was around Clark, as it was meant to demonstrate the draining of his powers.<ref name="metcom"/> "Clark time", the same idea behind [[bullet time]], was created because previous incarnations had not explained the idea of what the world appears like to Clark when he is using his powers. The first instance of "Clark time" was used in the "Metamorphosis" scene where Greg Arkin attacks Clark and Jonathan in their barn. Jonathan is pushed over a banister and falls in the direction of some dangerous farm equipment. The effect involved slowing time down for everything except Clark, who would be moving at normal pace.<ref name="metcom"/> When tackling Clark's emerging power of [[X-ray vision]], Gough and Millar wanted to be able to see skeletons and bones, as opposed to previous incarnations that treated the ability like "see-through" vision. The recent advances in computer imagery helped them complete that task.<ref name="X"/>

The digital effects costs for each episode could stretch the budget thin. In "Shimmer", Bill Millar, special effects supervisor, planned to create an artificial sunset for the closing scene involving Clark and Lana. The effects shot was supposed to last only a couple of seconds. James Marshall, the [[second unit director]] for the episode, decided to shoot the entire scene over the shoulders of Clark and Lana, looking at the sunset. The scene called for two [[Bluescreen|greenscreen]] shots, but when Marshall was finished he had created seventeen greenscreen shots. The seventeen shots, which produced the artificial sunset, cost $50,000 to produce.<ref name="Shim">Simpson, Paul, pp.56<U+2013>59</ref>  By comparison, the entire effects budget costs between $65,000 and $100,000.<ref name="an mag"/>

Over-spending of that nature became a regular occurrence on the ''Smallville'' set. The regularity of over-spending came to an end with "Kinetic", as the studio decided to be stricter with the spending.<ref name="Kinetic">Simpson, Paul, pp.68<U+2013>71</ref> With the budget on a stiffer guideline, the filmmakers were forced to cut scenes from "Kinetic", which was caught in the transition to writing more budget friendly scripts. One of the scenes to be cut involved one of the thieves phasing through a safe wall, and acting as a portal for the merchandise to be passed through.<ref name="Kinetic"/> When digital effects are not an option, Mike Walls, the physical effects supervisor who began his ''Smallville'' career with "Leech", still tries to provide big effects.<ref name="Cool"/> Walls used 75 cars for the final action scene of "Kinetic", which were cabled off to protect the actors. [[Stunt coordinator]] Lauro Chartrand attempts to make sure the actors are used as much as possible when performing fight scenes, unless the scenes are particularly dangerous. The fast shooting schedule forces Chartrand to rely on guest stars who can perform their own stunts, because of the limited time to find a "good double" for the actor.<ref name="Cool"/>

Physical effects were not an issue for the series regulars. Allison Mack performed her own stunts for the scene in "Hothead" where her character is set on fire,<ref name="Hot"/> and again in "Kinetic", when she was cabled off and dangled {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ground.<ref name="Kinetic"/> For "Nicodemus", the stunt coordinator received twice the help. Kristin Kreuk was expected to go to the tenth rung of a [[water tower]], in a scene which involved her character climbing to the top and falling off. As filming progressed, Kreuk climbed to the top, so the crew cabled her off and dropped her {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} to the bottom.<ref name="Nico">Simpson, Paul, pp.76<U+2013>79</ref> John Schneider's experience from ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' lent to him performing the [[Stunt#Vehicular stunts|stunt driving]] for his character. The scene required Schneider to [[Drifting (motorsport)|slide]] his truck around a corner, while yelling at some pedestrians on the sidewalk. The previous scene had established the driver side window as closed, so Schneider improvised and opened the driver's door as he slid 90<U+00B0> around a corner.<ref name="Nico"/>

The season received mostly favorable reviews. [[IGN]]'s Jeremy Conrad, who was initially against the idea of "reimagining" the Superman mythology, gave the first season a 7/10 rating. After reviewing the entire season, Conrad stated the first season of ''Smallville'' was "a solid start to what will be a great Superman TV series".<ref name="Conrad1">{{cite news|author=Jeremy Conrad|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/516/516863p1.html|title=Smallville&nbsp;<U+2014> The Complete First Season: The Man of Steel's early years look and sound great on DVD|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2004-05-19]]|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> [[Entertainment Weekly]]'s Bruce Fretts believes the series might appear "corny" on the surface, but actually shows "subversively witty spin on the comic-book myths".<ref name="Fretts">{{cite news|author=Bruce Fretts|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,252858,00.html|title=A Second Opinion|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=[[2001-10-21]]|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> [[Clint Morris]], founder of Moviehole.net, stated the series was "still finding its feet in season one"; although, he commended the acting, citing specifically Michael Rosenbaum's "uncontrollably likeable Lex Luthor".<ref name="Morris">{{cite news|author=[[Clint Morris]]|url=http://www.moviehole.net/reviews/20031226_965.html|title=Smallville: The Complete First Season (DVD)|publisher=Moviehole|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> ''The Free-Lance Star'''s Rob Hedelt commended the casting as well, comparing Welling's portrayal of a teenage Clark Kent to that of [[Christopher Reeve]]'s portrayal in the films. Hedelt considered John Schneider and Annette O'Toole to be ideal picks for Jonathan and Martha Kent, but felt Allison Mack and Sam Jones III, important characters, were the weakest part of the ensemble.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rob Hedelt|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2001/102001/10282001/427249|title=Superman's in high school in WB's fun 'Smallville'| publisher=Fredericksburg.com|date=[[2001-10-28]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

Other critics were less enthusiastic about the season. Peter Bowes of [[BBC News]] felt the season was simply a "[[soap opera]]" with "pretty young people". Bowes believes the season suffered from the "sentimental boy-girl storyline", but that die-hard Superman fans would still be taken in by this incarnation of the character's early years.<ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Bowes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1517326.stm|title=Smallville: Add Your Views|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2001-08-30]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> A common criticism for the first season was the use of "[[villain of the week]]" storylines. By the time the first seven episodes aired, at least one journalist had had enough of the villain of the week format. [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'s [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] stated the series works best with its "character interaction and a nice performance by John Schneider as Pa Kent", but that the show needs more than the "'monster of the week' stories seen so far".<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011129owen1129p3.asp|title=Tuned In: It's time to revisit the season's new shows|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|Post-Gazette]]|date=[[2001-11-29]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Jordan Levin, president of The WB's Entertainment division, recognized the concerns that the show had become a villain of the week series. Levin announced that season two would see more "smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes, to get away from some of the formulaic storytelling structure" the series has fallen into.<ref name="Post">{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20020116owen0116p3.asp|title=Tuned In: UPN got 'Buffy,' but WB gets ratings|publisher=Post-Gazette|date=[[2002-01-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>
