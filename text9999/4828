'''Psychedelic rock''' is a style of [[rock music]] that is inspired or influenced by [[psychedelic]] culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of [[psychedelic drug]]s. It often uses new recording techniques and effects and draws on non-Western sources such the [[raga]]s and drones of [[Music of India|Indian music]].

It was pioneered by musicians including [[The Beatles]], [[The Byrds]] and [[The Yardbirds]], emerging as a genre during the mid 1960s among [[folk rock]] and [[blues rock]] bands in [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], such as [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Pink Floyd]]. It reached a peak in between 1967 and 1969 with the [[Summer of Love]] and [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock rock festival]], becoming an international musical movement and associated with a widespread [[counter-culture]], before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas.

Psychedelic rock influenced the creation of [[psychedelic pop]] and [[psychedelic soul]]. It also bridged the transition from early [[blues]]- and [[folk music]]-based rock to [[progressive rock]], [[glam rock]], [[hard rock]] and as a result influenced the development of sub-genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of [[neo-psychedelia]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Sitar full.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[sitar]], much used on early records of the genre.]]
As a musical style psychedelic rock attempted to replicate the effects and enhance the mind-altering experiences of hallucinogenic drugs, incorporating new electronic and record effects, extended solo's and improvisation and was particularly influenced by eastern mysticism, reflected in use of exotic instrumentation, particularly from Indian music or the incorporation of elements of eastern music. Major features include:

==Etymology==
The term psychedelic was first coined in 1957 by [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] [[Humphry Osmond]] as an alternative descriptor for [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]]s in the context of [[psychedelic psychotherapy]].<ref>N. Murray, ''Aldous Huxley: A Biography''
(Hachette, 2009), ISBN 0748112316, p. 419.</ref> The first musical use of the term psychedelic is thought to have been by the New York-based folk group [[The Holy Modal Rounders]] on their version of [[Lead Belly]]'s "[[Hesitation Blues]]" in 1964.<ref>M. Hicks, ''Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions'' (University of Illinois Press, 2000), ISBN 978-0-252-06915-4, pp 59<U+2013>60.</ref> The first group to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock were the [[13th Floor Elevators]] from Texas, at the end of 1965. The term was first used in print in the ''Austin American Statesman'' in an article about the band titled "Unique Elevators shine with psychedelic rock", dated 10 February 1966, and theirs was the first album to use the term as part of its title, in ''[[The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators]]'', released in August that year.<ref name=Hicks2000/> As the counter-cultural scene developed in San Francisco the terms [[acid rock]] and psychedelic rock were used in 1966 to describe the new drug-influenced music<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=21UEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&dq=%22psychedelic+rock%22+%22acid+rock%22&hl=en&ei=hy1dT9-kIYSs0QXEz9y5DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22psychedelic%20rock%22%20%22acid%20rock%22&f=false "Logical Outcome of fifty years of art"], ''LIFE'', 9 September 1966, p. 68.</ref> and were being widely used by 1967.<ref name=DeRogatispp8-9>J. DeRogatis, ''Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock'' (Milwaukie, Michigan: Hal Leonard, 2003), ISBN 0-6340-5548-8, pp. 8-9.</ref> The terms psychedelic rock and acid rock are often used interchangeably,<ref name=Browne&Browne2001p8/> but some commentators have distinguished the former, which generally evoked the effects of psychedelic drugs, and acid rock, which can be seen as a more extreme sub-genre that focused more directly on LSD, was often louder, made greater use of distortion and often consisted of long, improvised [[Jam session|jams]].<ref name=AllmusicAcidRock>[http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2690 "Acid rock"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 20 March 2012.</ref><ref>Eric V. d.

[[File:Ginsberg-dylan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] in 1975]]

Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Media, Industry and Society'' (New York, NY: Continuum, 2003), ISBN 0-8264-6321-5, p. 211.</ref>

Two of the most successful and influential acts of the era, Bob Dylan and the Beatles, were among the first to experiment with such references. Dylan's song "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]" (1965), which may have taken its title from a Kerouac novel,<ref>M. Gray, ''Song & Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan'' (New York, NY: Continuum, 1999, 2000), ISBN 0-8264-5150-0, p. 83.</ref> included the line, "Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine" and his "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" (1965) requested, "take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship". Whether this was intended as a drug reference was unclear, but the line would enter rock music when it was covered by the Byrds later in the year.<ref name=DeRogatispp8-9/> Dylan indicated that he had taken cannabis, but has denied using hard drugs. Nevertheless, his lyrics would continue to contain apparent drug references.<ref name=Mann2009p87/> After being introduced to cannabis by Dylan, members of [[The Beatles]] began experimenting with LSD from 1965 and the group introduced many of the major elements of the psychedelic sound to audiences in this period, with "[[I Feel Fine]]" (1964) using guitar feedback; "[[Norwegian Wood]]" from their 1965 ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album using a [[sitar]], and the employment of backwards spooling on their 1966 single B-side "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]".<ref name=AllmusicPsych>V.

The lyric of ''Day Tripper'', he later explained, was an attack on "weekend hippies" - those who donned floral shirts and headbands to listen to "acid rock" between 9-to-5 office-jobs", in I.

[[File:Janis Joplin Big Brother and the Holding Company.jpg|thumb|right|[[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], c. 1966-67: [[Janis Joplin]] is seated in the foreground.]]
The psychedelic life style had already developed in California, particularly in San Francisco, by the mid-1960s, with the first major underground LSD factory established by [[Owsley Stanley]].<ref name=DeRogatispp8-9/> There was also an emerging music scene of folk clubs, coffee houses and independent radio stations, that catered for the population of students at nearby [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and free thinkers that had gravitated to the city.<ref name=Unterberger2003pp11-13>R.

[[The Byrds]], emerging from the Californian folk scene, and the [[Yardbirds]] from the [[British blues]] scene, have been seen as particularly influential on the development of the genre.<ref name=AllmusicPsych/> Drug use and attempts at psychedelic music moved out of acoustic folk-based music towards rock soon after The Byrds "plugged in" to produce a chart topping version of Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man" in the summer of 1965, which became a [[folk rock]] standard.<ref>R.

The [[San Francisco]] music scene continued to develop as [[The Fillmore]], the [[Avalon Ballroom]], and [[The Matrix (club)|The Matrix]] began booking local rock bands on a nightly basis. The first Trips Festival, sponsored by the Merry Pranksters and held at the Longshoremen's Hall in January 1966, saw The Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company play to an audience of 10,000, giving many their first encounter with both acid rock, with its long instrumentals and unstructured jams, and LSD.<ref>B.

He produced shows attracting most of the major psychedelic rock bands and operated The Fillmore. When this proved too small he took over [[Winterland]] and then the [[Fillmore West]] (in San Francisco) and the [[Fillmore East]] (in New York City), where the major rock artists, from both the US and the UK, came to play.<ref>N.
