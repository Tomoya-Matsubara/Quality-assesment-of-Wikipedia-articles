[[Lindsay Hassett]] was the vice-captain and one of three on-tour selectors<ref>Hassett was not among the three selectors who chose the touring squad. However, during the tour, Bradman, Hassett and [[Arthur Morris]] chose the teams for the respective matches.</ref> for [[Don Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]]. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a touring side earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles'', and resulted in them being regarded as one of the greatest teams of all time. A right-handed batsman, Hassett played in all five Tests; he was a [[batting order (cricket)|middle-order batsman]] in all but the Fourth Test, when he stood in as an opener due to an injury to [[Sid Barnes]].

As the matches were often played consecutively without a day between fixtures, Australia employed a rotation policy, and as a result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures in which more than half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters, both on [[sticky wicket|damp pitches]] before the First Test. Against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]], Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after [[Sam Loxton]] succumbed to injury. In a later match against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], Australia ceded a first innings lead for the first time on tour, but recovered to win by eight wickets.

Hassett ended the first-class matches with 1,563 runs at a [[batting average]] of 74.22 including seven centuries. Among the Australians, he had the third highest aggregate behind Bradman and [[Arthur Morris]] and the second highest average. His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the [[History_of_English_amateur_cricket#Amateurism_in_cricket|Gentlemen of England]]. Hassett was less successful in the Tests, scoring 310 runs at 44.28 with one [[century (cricket)|century]]. This placed him fourth in the Australian aggregates, but only seventh in the averages. His biggest contribution was his 137 in the first innings of the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]]. It was a patient innings as England attempted to stop Australia's scoring with defensive [[leg theory]]; Hassett helped the tourists set up a first innings lead of 344, which laid the foundation for the eventual victory. He had three scores between 35 and 50 during the Tests, but was unable to convert his starts into large innings. Hassett took 23 catches on the tour, the most by an Australia excluding [[wicket-keeper]]s.

Hassett was named as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] for 1949. ''[[Wisden]]'' remarked that "in addition to his playing ability Hassett's cheerfulness and leadership, which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme, combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman's busy shoulders".<Ref name=wisden/>

== Early tour ==
The 1948 tour was Hassett's second Test campaign in England. A diminutive right-handed batsman, he toured England under Bradman in 1938, making his Test debut during the series and playing in all four matches. Following the interruption of [[World War II]], Hassett led the [[Australian Services cricket team|Australian Services]]&mdash;a military team&mdash;in the [[Victory Tests]]. He became a regular member of the Test team and was the vice-captain under Bradman for the series against [[England cricket team|England]] and [[Indian cricket team|India]] in Australia during 1946&ndash;47 and 1947&ndash;48 respectively. In the latter Test series, he averaged 110.66 with the bat, and he was duly selected for the tour of England, continuing in his role as Bradman's deputy.<ref name=wisden/>

Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].<ref name=haigh>{{cite news|title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon |last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=2007-05-26| accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> Hassett thus played as vice-captain of Bradman's first-choice team and took a catch as Australia dismissed the hosts for 233. However, when Australia batted, Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett came in at No. 7 with Australia<U+2019>s score at 5/320 after losing 4/55 in a middle-order collapse. Hassett made 25 in 66 minutes with three fours as Australia [[declaration and forfeiture|declared]] at 8/462; the hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete an Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs.<Ref name=worcs>{{cite web

The Australians then proceeded to play [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] at [[Bradford]], on a [[sticky wicket|damp pitch]] that suited slower bowling; rain delayed the start of the match until midway through the first afternoon.<Ref name=o>{{cite web

Australia replied with 101 without Loxton, who was unable to bat. Hassett came in at 1/24 and was immediately out for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]]. Australia then bowled out the hosts in the second innings for 89. Chasing 60 for victory,<ref name=york/> Hassett elected to not ask for the pitch to be [[road roller|rolled]].

Without further addition to the score, Hassett attempted a [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|pull shot]] and top edged it so high that five players had the time to converge and any of these could have caught the ball. The catch was eventually taken directly in front of Hassett, leaving Australia at 5/20.<ref name=fy/> To make matters worse, Loxton was still too injured to bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912.<Ref name=f55>Fingleton, p. 55.</ref> [[Neil Harvey]] had scored a solitary run when he was dropped at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|short leg]].

== First Test ==
{{main|First Test, 1948 Ashes series}}

Australia headed into the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]] with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, including eight innings victories.<ref name=sched/> England captain [[Norman Yardley]] won the toss and elected to bat.<Ref name="sco1"/> Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]] in the first hour.<Ref name=f82>Fingleton, p. 82.</ref> The surface had greened up following overnight rain.<ref name=f82/> Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day.<Ref name=sco1/> The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon.<Ref name=sco1/>

Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would throughout the day.<Ref name="report1"/><Ref name=f91>Fingleton, p. 91.</ref> Hassett almost holed out early when he knocked a ball from [[Alec Bedser]] up in the air and it just evaded the grasp of wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]].<Ref name=f91/> Yardley continued to employ [[leg theory]], as he and [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]] bowled outside leg stump; this tactic stifled the Australian scoring but also limited wicket-taking opportunites. During one [[over (cricket)|over]], Bradman did not attempt to hit a single ball and put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England<U+2019>s tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian skipper did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. In the last session, Bradman brought up one of his slowest ever centuries,<Ref name=f92>Fingleton, p. 92.</ref> as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking Australian wickets.<Ref name="report1">{{Cite web|title= First Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152894.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref> Bradman reached stumps on 130.

Hassett added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. Australia were unhurried and remained patient in the face of Yardley<U+2019>s defensive tactics because they had bowled England out on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result.<Ref name=f94/> After the break, Hassett reached his first Test century on English soil. from 305 minutes.

== Third Test ==
{{main|Third Test, 1948 Ashes series}}

The teams reassembled at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] for the Third Test. Australia replaced Brown&mdash;who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings&mdash;<Ref name="sco1"/><Ref name="sco2"/> with the all rounder Loxton,<Ref name="sco3"/> who had made an unbeaten 47 against Surrey and 159 not out against Gloucestershire.<Ref name=surrey2/><ref name=gloucs/> England made 363 after electing to bat.<Ref name="sco3"/> On the second day, Australia were in trouble when Hassett came in at 2/13.<Ref name=sco3/> Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter was beaten in [[flight (cricket)|flight]] by [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]]. Attempting to break Young's restrictive [[leg side]] bowling, Hassett attempted to loft him over [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|cover]], but mishit the ball and was caught by [[Cyril Washbrook]].<Ref name=f139>Fingleton, p. 139.</ref> This left Australia at 3/82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs.<ref name=sco3/>

In England's second innings, Lindwall [[bouncer (cricket)|bounced]] Washbrook and the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew in the air straight towards [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|fine leg]], where Hassett dropped the ball on the third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21.<ref name=f142>Fingleton, p. 142.</ref> The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|long leg]] and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman before humourously gesturing to indicate that he was ready for the next catch, much to the amusement of the crowd.<ref name=f144/> On 80, Washbrook was dropped in the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|slips cordon]] by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack.<Ref name=f144>Fingleton, p. 144.</ref><Ref name="report3"/> After the day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position at 3/174, with an overall lead of 316.<Ref name=f144/> Luckily for Australia, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition to their score midway through the last day; the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to reach 1/92 and ensure that the match ended in a draw.<Ref name=sco3/><Ref name="report3">{{Cite web|title= Third Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152896.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref>

With Barnes injured, Hassett moved from the middle-order to open the innings with Morris.<Ref name=sco3/><Ref name=sco4/> Bedser removed Morris for six to leave Australia at 1/13, bringing Bradman to the crease.<ref name=sco4/><Ref>Fingleton, pp. 158&ndash;159.</ref> 
Hassett batted in a restrained manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63.<Ref name="sco4"/> Bradman did the majority of the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50.<Ref name="sco4"/> On the third morning, play resumed in hot and humid conditions.<ref name=f159>Fingleton, p. 159.</ref><ref name=f160>Fingleton, p. 160.</ref> In the second over delivered by [[Dick Pollard]], the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable to get out of the way and edged the ball to [[Jack Crapp]] for 13. Bradman was out in the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day.<Ref name=sco4/><ref name=report4/> Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.<ref name=sco4/>

England declared at 8/365 after two overs on the last day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a [[road roller|heavy roller]], which would help to break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin.<Ref name="report4"/> Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.<ref name=f173>Fingleton, p. 173.</ref>

Yardely<U+2019>s declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting team. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target; the local press wrote them off and predicted that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket that was expected to favour the spin bowlers.<ref name="b ashes">Perry (2001), pp. 84&ndash;89.</ref> Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six [[over (cricket)|overs]] on a surface that offered spin and bounce.<Ref name="report4"/> Only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that 360 runs were still needed in 285 minutes.<ref name="b ashes"/><Ref name=p15>Pollard, p. 15.</ref> Evans then missed a leg-side [[stump (cricket)|stumping]] opportunity against Hassett as Bedser beat both openers with extra bounce.<ref name=f174>Fingleton, p. 174.</ref> Hassett was dismissed by Compton's [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] for 17 with the score at 57. The Englishman<U+2019>s delivery had caught Hassett's leading edge and he dived forward in his [[List of cricket terms#F|follow through]] to take a one-handed catch just above the ground.<ref name=f175>Fingleton, p. 175.</ref> Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes.<ref name="b ashes"/><ref name=f175/> The English spinners created a number of chances against both batsmen, but multiple catches and stumping opportunities were fumbled. Aside from the missed wicket-taking opportunities, the spinners were erratic in line and length and Bradman and Morris plundered many boundaries.<ref>Fingleton, pp. 175&ndash;184.</ref> Australia went on to complete the world record chase with seven wickets and 15 minutes in hand, ensuring an unassailable 3&ndash;0 series lead.<ref name=sco4/><ref name=report4/>

Hassett was rested as Australia amassed 456 and defeated [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test.<Ref name=o/><ref>{{cite web

In response to the home side's 138, Hassett top-scored with 68 in Australia's first innings of 254 before being trapped [[leg before wicket]] by [[Eric Hollies]] as the tourists defeated [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] by nine wickets.<ref name=o/><Ref name=sched/><ref name=warwick>{{cite web

Edrich failed to get the ball in the middle of the bat and it looped up and travelled around 10&nbsp;m. Hassett caught the ball just [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|behind square leg]], diving sideways to get two hands to the ball.<Ref name="f184">Fingleton, p. 184.</ref> Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|third man]], who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out.<Ref name="f185">Fingleton, p. 185.</ref> However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.<Ref name=sco5/>

In contrast, Australia batted with apparent ease,<ref name="report5"/> as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out late on the first afternoon.<ref name="f186">Fingleton, p. 186.</ref> The opening partnership had reached 117 before Hollies removed Barnes for 61.<ref name="sco5"/> This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00.<Ref name="report5"/> As Bradman had announced that the tour would be his last at international level,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/bradman/bio-page.htm#14|title=Biographical essay by Michael Page|publisher=State Library South Australia|accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref> the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once.

Hassett came in with the score at 2/117 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the [[H. D. G. Leveson-Gower]]'s XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate.

In recognition of his performances, Hassett was named as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in 1949. ''[[Wisden]]'' opined that "in addition to his playing ability Hassett's cheerfulness and leadership, which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme, combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman's busy shoulders".<Ref name=wisden>{{cite web |year=1949 |title=Lindsay Hassett |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154629.html| publisher=[[Wisden]] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref>
