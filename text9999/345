A controversy exists over the [[national identity]] and name of the [[native language]] of the main ethnic group in the Republic of [[Moldova]]. The issue more frequently disputed is whether [[Moldovans]] constitute a subgroup of [[Romanians]] or a separate ethnic group. While there is wide agreement{{Fact|date=June 2014}} about the existence of a common language, the controversy persists about the use of the term "[[Moldovan language]]" in certain political contexts.

The [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova]] from 1991 calls the official language "[[Romanian language|Romanian]]",<ref name="dec-ro">{{ro}}[http://old.parlament.md/img/pdf/declaratia.pdf Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moldova.org/page/declaration-of-independence-of-the-republic-of-moldova-487-eng.html |title=Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova |publisher=Moldova Foundation}}</ref> and the first anthem adopted by the independent Moldova was "[[De<U+015F>teapt<U+0103>-te, rom<U+00E2>ne]]" ("Awaken, Romanian!"), the same as the anthem of [[Romania]]. Mirroring political evolutions in the country, the [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)]] calls the official language "Moldovan",<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Constitution of the Republic of Moldova. Article 13, Chapter 1 |date=1994-06-29 |quote= The official language of the Republic of Moldova is Moldovan, written in Latin script.}}</ref> and establishes as anthem "[[Limba noastr<U+0103>]]" (''Our language'', without any explicit reference to its name). Moreover, in 2003, a non-judicial political document<ref>[http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view=doc&lang=1&id=349655 Decizia Curtii Constitutionale nr.10/25.07.2013] {{Ro icon}}</ref> called "The Concept of National Policy of the Republic of Moldova",<ref>{{cite web |title=L E G E privind aprobarea Conceptiei politicii nationale de stat a Republicii Moldova |trans_title=Law on the Concept of National Policy of the Republic of Moldova |url=http://www.bri.gov.md/oDepartamentru/ArhiveNews/Conceptia/CNPSrom.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100124141709/http://www.bri.gov.md/oDepartamentru/ArhiveNews/Conceptia/CNPSrom.htm |archivedate=2010-01-24 |publisher=Departamentul Relatii Interetnice}}</ref> adopted by the then [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communist]]-dominated Parliament, explicitly designates the [[Romanians]] as an ethnic minority in [[Moldova]].

The officially sanctioned distinction between [[Moldovans]] and [[Romanians]] has been criticized by some members of the scientific community within Moldova.<ref>{{cite news

== Self-identification and popular perceptions ==
A survey published in 2002 by a Norwegian academic group led by P<U+00E5>l Kolst<U+00F8> found that ethnic self-identification as exclusively Romanian was very low in Moldova; only 12 of 762 people identified as exclusively Romanian. (The group did not interview any inhabitants of [[Transnistria]].) On the question whether ethnic Moldovans differ from ethnic Romanians, 26% of the self-proclaimed Moldovans said "very different", 55% "somewhat different", and only 5% saw no difference. In contrast, on the question about the difference between the Moldovan and Romanian language, 53.5% saw no difference, 33.3% considered them "somewhat different", and 11% did not know. Kolst<U+00F8> et al. concluded that "Whatever the Romanian-speaking population of Moldavia used to regard themselves in the interwar period, the vast majority of them have now internalized a Moldovan ethnic identity." They noted however that this identity is only "weakly related" to language.<ref name="Kolst<U+00F8>2002">{{cite book|author=P<U+00E5>l Kolst<U+00F8>|title=The National Integration and Violent Conflict in Post-Soviet Societies: The Cases of Estonia and Moldova|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1888-9|page=34 (see p. 32 for note about Transnistria).}}</ref>

A poll conducted in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed picture of the perception of identity inside the country. The participants were asked to rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18<U+2013>29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital [[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]], for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), people are more likely to perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interlic.md/download/988/ |title=Barometrul Socio-Politic |author=Institutul de Marketing <U+015F>i Sondaje: IMAS-INC Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u |date=October 2009}}</ref>

== Linguistic dispute ==

There is essentially no disagreement that the standard form of the official language in [[Moldova]] is identical to standard Romanian. The spoken language of Moldova, in spite of small regional differences, is completely understandable to speakers from Romania and viceversa.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The slight differences are in pronunciation and the choice of vocabulary. For example, [[cabbage]], [[drill]] and [[water melon]] are respectively "curechi", "sfredel" and "harbuz" in both the Republic of Moldova and the part of Moldavia in Romania, but their synonyms "varz<U+0103>", "burghiu" and "pepene" are preferred in Wallachia. However, [[Daco-Romanian]] speakers might know and understand both forms of each term.

Those who want to avoid the linguistic controversy sometimes use the clause ''"limba de stat" (state language)''.

== Dual citizenship ==
{{see also|Citizenship in Romania}}
In 2001, the [[European Union|EU]] pressured Romania to require an [[international passport]] for all Moldovan travelers.
Immediately thereafter, a substantial number of Moldovans began to apply for Romanian citizenship. Unofficial data from 2001 suggested that about 200,000 Moldovans also held a Romanian citizenship, despite the fact that dual citizenship was officially illegal in Moldova at the time. Due to the overwhelming number of applications, the Romanian embassy imposed a moratorium in 2002. Dual citizenship became an election issue during the [[Moldovan local election, 2003|2003 local elections in Moldova]]. In November that year, the Moldovan parliament passed a law which allowed dual citizenship; this applied to other countries besides Romania, particularly Russia and Ukraine.<ref>Roper, S. D. (2005). The politicization of education: Identity formation in Moldova and Transnistria. Communist and Post-Communist Studies, 38(4), 501-514 (507). {{doi|10.1016/j.postcomstud.2005.09.003}}</ref>

In September 2007, Romania resumed its policy of grating (or [[Restitution|restoring]] as it says) Romanian citizenship to Moldovans who requested it. In response, the Communist-led Moldovan parliament passed a law (in October 2007<ref>DUAL CITIZENSHIP RESTRICTIONS: CONCERN WITH PUBLIC INTERESTS OR FEAR OVER OWN CITIZENS pdc.ceu.hu/archive/00003691/01/Legal_Commentaries_2007-03.pdf</ref>) prohibiting anyone holding dual citizenship or residing abroad from holding [[public office]].<ref name="Baub<U+00F6>ckPerchinig2009">{{cite book|editor1=Rainer Baub<U+00F6>ck|editor2=Bernhard Perchinig|editor3=Wiebke Sievers|title=Citizenship Policies in the New Europe|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-8964-108-3|page=203|author=Constantin Iordachi|chapter=Politics of Citizenship in Postcommunist Romania}}</ref> Until 2007, some 120 000 Moldovan citizens received Romanian citizenship.

== Political positions ==
The major Moldovan political forces have diverging opinions regarding the identity of Moldovans. This contradiction is reflected in their stance toward the national history that should be taught in schools. Forces such as the Liberal Party (PL), Liberal Democratic Party (PLDM) and Our Moldova Alliance (AMN) support the teaching of the history of Romanians. Others, such as the Democratic Party (PD) and the Party of Communists (PCRM) support the history of Republic of Moldova.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adevarul.ro/international/europa/istoria-romanilor-scolile-moldovene-vlad-filat-vrea-marian-lupu-nu-1_50ad27ce7c42d5a6638fb911/index.html |title=Istoria rom<U+00E2>nilor <U+00EE>n <U+015F>colile moldovene: Vlad Filat vrea, Marian Lupu nu |work=[[Adev<U+0103>rul]] |date=2009-10-05 |quote=Vlad Filat, president of PLDM: "Vom <U+00EE>nv<U+0103><U+0163>a istoria noastr<U+0103>  - cea a rom<U+00E2>nilor, a<U+015F>a cum este <U+015F>i firesc"/"We will teach our history - that of Romanians, as it is natural" Marian Lupu, president PD: "Dup<U+0103> p<U+0103>rerea noastr<U+0103>, cea mai bun<U+0103> variant<U+0103> [...] ar fi istoria statului nostru <U+2013> istoria Republicii Moldova.

===Moldovenism===
{{main|Moldovenism}}
The Soviet attempts, which started after 1924 and were fully implemented after 1940, to strongly emphasize the local Moldovan identity and transform it into a separate ethnicity, as well as its reiteration in the [[post-independence Moldovan politics]], especially during the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Communist government]] (2001<U+2013>2009), is often referred to as Moldovanism. The Moldovanist position refutes the purported Romanian-Moldovan ethnic identity, and also at times the existence of a common language.<ref>[[Gheorghe E. Cojocaru]], ''The Comintern and the Origins of Moldovanism'' (Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u: Civitas, 2009)</ref> US historian [[James Stuart Olson]], in his book - ''An Ethnohistorical dictionary of the Russian and Soviet empires'' - considers that Moldovans and Romanians are so closely related to the Romanian language, ethnicity and historical development that they can be considered one and the same people.<ref>[[James Stuart Olson]], ''An Ethnohistorical dictionary of the Russian and Soviet empires'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1994, pg. 477</ref>

Since "Moldovan" is widely considered merely a political term used to designate the Romanian language,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communicaid.com/language-courses/moldovan/index.php |title=Moldovan Language Courses |publisher=Communicaid |quote=It is widely accepted among linguists that Moldovan is the same language as Romanian}}</ref> the supporters of a distinct language are often regarded as anti-scientific or politicianist. A typical example is the [[Moldovan-Romanian dictionary]].

=== Moldovan presidents on the language and identity of Moldovans ===

====Moldavian identity in medieval chronicles ====
The chronicles of medieval [[Moldavia]] attested the names used by the inhabitants of Moldavia to refer to themselves as well as the common language and origin of Moldavians, Wallachians and Transylvanians. The first important chronicler of Moldavia, [[Grigore Ureche]] (1590<U+2013>1647), states that the Romanians of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]] and Moldavians have the same origin, since both "come from Rome".<ref>''Rum<U+00E2>nii, c<U+00E2><U+021B>i s<U+0103> afl<U+0103> l<U+0103>cuitori la <U+021A>ara Ungureasc<U+0103> <U+0219>i la Ardeal <U+0219>i la Maramoro<U+0219>u, de la un loc suntu cu moldov<U+00E9>nii <U+0219>i to<U+021B>i de la R<U+00E2>m s<U+0103> trag.''</ref> The same author refers to the language of his work as "our Moldavian language". Later, chronicler [[Miron Costin]] (1633<U+2013>1691) wrote in his ''On the Moldavian nation'' that  the "oldest and more righteous" name of the people inhabiting Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania is ''Rum<U+00E2>n'' (Romanian), "that is [[Roman Empire|Roman]]", and that this name was kept from Emperor [[Trajan]]'s colonizations till to that day, albeit more commonly among the Wallachians and the Romanians of Transylvania. He also mentioned that, while the people of Moldavia identify as "Moldavian", they call their language "Romanian".{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} His son, chronicler [[Nicolae Costin]] (1660<U+2013>1712), expressed similar opinions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}The Wallachian chronicler [[:ro:Constantin Cantacuzino, stolnicul|Constantin Cantacuzino]] (1655<U+2013>1716) explains that by Romanians he means Romanians from Wallachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia, as they all speak essentially the same language and have a common origin. Nevertheless he also states that, unlike the Wallachians and the Romanians from Transylvania, which identify as "Romanians", the population of Moldavia identifies as "Moldavian".{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}  [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] (1673<U+2013>1723), Prince of Moldavia and member of the [[Royal Academy of Berlin]], wrote a history book called ''Hronicul vechimei a Romano-Moldo-Vlahilor'' (Chronicle of the Ancientness of the Romanian-Moldavian-Vlachs). In the introductory part, he calls it "a chronicle of the entire Romanian land" (''Hronicon a toat<U+0103> <U+0162>ara Rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>'') that "later was divided into Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania" (''care apoi s-au <U+00EE>mp<U+0103>r<U+0163>it <U+00EE>n Moldova, Munteneasc<U+0103> <U+015F>i Ardealul'') and mentions that the book was first written in Latin and then translated into Romanian (''pre limba rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>''). While attesting that the people of Moldavia call themselves "Moldavians", he also states that "Romanian" is to be used when referring commonly to Transylvanians, Moldavians and Wallachians(''carii cu to<U+0163>ii cu un nume de ob<U+015F>te rom<U+00E2>ni s<U+0103> chiam<U+0103>'').{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

====Diplomats' opinion====
[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], Ruler of the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], Empress of Russia between 1762<U+2013>1796, were willing to unite Moldavia and Wallachia, then under Ottoman sovereignty, in order to create an independent buffer state between Russia and Austria. The proposed independent state, named [[Dacia]], would have contained Moldavia, Bessarabia and Wallachia, but Catherine wished it under Russian influence as it was presented in the so-called "Greek Project".<ref>Keith Hitchins, ''The Romanians: 1774-1866'', Clarendon Press Oxford, 1996, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LUR3qXStHvAC&pg=PA47&dq=Catherine++dacia+russia&hl=ro&ei=lHOwTIXoJ43MswaYxojJDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q&f=false pg44, pg.47]</ref> During the British Parliament debates of 1793, Mr. Whitebread, speaking about the initiative of France to erect an independent Belgium from Austro-Hungaria, mentions [[Edmund Burke| Edmund Burke's]] initiative to form an independent state from the Ottoman Empire, named Circle of the Danube comprising Wallachia, Moldavia and Bessarabia.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=i3VHAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=ro#v=onepage&q&f=false The parliamentary register, Vol. 34, London, Burlington House, 1793, pg. 405]</ref>

=== Bessarabia in the Russian Empire (1812&ndash;1918) ===
In 1812, the eastern part of the Principality of [[Moldavia]], called [[Bessarabia]], which includes the current territory of Republic of Moldova (except for [[Transnistria]]) was ceded by the Ottomans to the Russian empire.

The idea of a unified state including all Romanian speakers from Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia did not emerge before the 18th century, as it was "foreign to the spirit of the age" <ref name="LucianBoia">Lucian Boia, History and Myth in the Romanian consciousness, p 129</ref> Starting with the 18th century, a pan-Romanian national idea appeared, inspired by the German and French [[romantic nationalism]]. The young [[boyar]]s from Moldavia and Wallachia educated in western universities returned home with ambitious political goals to modernize their countries, and sought to accomplish the ideal of a unified Romanian [[nation state]]. One important step was achieved in 1859, in a favorable international context, with the election of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as a common ruler of the autonomous principalities of Wallachia and (western) Moldavia. The newly formed Romanian state set among its primary tasks to inculcate the sentiment of belonging to a common Romanian nation to the illiterate rural majority through state-funded universal elementary school. The Romantic historical discourse reinterpreted history as a march towards the unified state. The creation of a standardized Romanian language and orthography, the adoption of the Roman alphabet to replace the older [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] were also important elements of the national project.<ref name="LucianBoia" /><ref>Goina, C<U+0103>lin.

Such developments were not reflected in the Russian controlled Bessarabia. The Russification policy of the regime, more successful among the higher strata of the society, did not have an important effect on the majority of rural Moldavians. As Romanian politician [[Take Ionescu]] noted at the time, "the Romanian landlords were Russified through a policy of cooptation, the government allowing them to maintain leading positions in the administration of the province, whereas the peasantry was indifferent to the national problem: there were no schools for de-nationalization, and, although the church service was held in Russian, this was actually of little significance" <ref name="PetrescuCristina">Petrescu, Cristina.

In 1849, [[George Long (scholar)|George Long]] writes that Wallachia and [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavia]] are separated only by a political boundary and that their history is closely connected. About the latter he says that it is inhabited mainly by ''Wallachians'' who call themselves ''Roomoon'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]).<ref>[[George Long (scholar)|George Long]], ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'', volume XV, London, 1849, published by [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], pg. 304</ref> Ethnologist [[Robert Gordon Latham]], writes in 1854, that the name by which a Wallachian, Moldavian or a Bessarabian designates himself is ''Roman'' or ''Rumanyo'' (Romanian), a name the author also applies to the Romance speakers of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].<ref>[[Robert Gordon Latham]], ''The native races of the Russian Empire'', London, 1854, pg.268</ref> Similarly, in 1845, German brothers Arthur Schott and Albert Schott (historian) write in the beginning of their book - ''Walachische M<U+00E4>hrchen'' (Wallachian Fairy Tales) - that [[Vlachs|Wallachians]] live in Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, Hungary, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thessaly]].<ref>[http://books.google.ro/books?id=E2UAAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Arthur Schott, Albert Schott, ''Walachische M<U+00E4>hrchen'', Cotta, Stuttgart and T<U+00FC>bingen, 1845, pg. 3]</ref> The authors also mentions that Wallachians respond ''Eo sum Romanu'' (I am [[Romanians|Romanian]]) when asked what they are.<ref>[http://books.google.ro/books?id=E2UAAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Arthur Schott, Albert Schott, ''Walachische M<U+00E4>hrchen'', Cotta, Stuttgart and T<U+00FC>bingen, 1845, pg. 44]</ref>

=== Bessarabia within Greater Romania (1918&ndash;1940) ===
In 1918, [[Sfatul <U+0162><U+0103>rii]] voted for the [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union]] of Bessarabia with the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. At the time, the Romanian army was already present in Bessarabia. US historian [[Charles Upson Clark]] notes that several Bessarabian ministers, Codreanu, Pelivan and Secara, and the Russian commander-in-chief Shcherbachev had asked for its intervention to maintain order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_19.shtml |title=Electronic Text Archive |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> He also mentions that after the arrival of Romanian army "all classes in Bessarabia, except the Russian revolutionaries, breathed a sigh of relief".<ref name="depts.washington.edu">{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_20.shtml#bc_20 |title=Electronic Text Archive |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> However, he adds that, at the beginning, the intervention had "roused great resentment among those who still clung to the hope of a Bessarabian state within the Russian Federated Republic" such as [[Ion Inculet]], president of [[Sfatul Tarii]] and prime-minister [[Pantelimon Erhan]] who initially demanded the prompt withdrawal of the Romanian troops to avoid a civil war.<ref>[[Charles Upson Clark]], [http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_19.shtml ''Anarchy in Bessarabia''] in  Bessarabia: Russia and Roumania on the Black Sea. Dodd, Mead & Co., N.Y., 1927</ref> However, Inculet later welcomed Romanian general Brosteanu, who was in charge with the intervention, to a formal reception at [[Sfatul Tarii]].<ref name="depts.washington.edu"/>

Given the complex circumstances, some scholars such as Cristina Petrescu and US historian [[Charles King (author)|Charles King]] considered controversial the Bessarabian vote in favor of the union with Romania.<ref>Petrescu, Cristina. ''Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans'' in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian & Hungarian Case Studies''. Editura [[Polirom]]. 2001. p. 156</ref><ref>King, Charles. ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture''. [[Hoover Press]]. 2000. p. 34</ref> On the contrary, historian [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] thinks that the presence of the Romanian army "did not cause the unification, [...] but only consolidated it".
.<ref>Sorin Alexandrescu, Paradoxul roman, page 48. "Prezenta militara romaneasca in Basarabia nu a cauzat deci unirea - vointa politica pentru aceasta exista oricum - ci doar a consolidat-o</ref> Similarly, [[Bernard Newman (author)|Bernard Newman]], who traveled by bike in the whole of [[Greater Romania]], claimed there is little doubt that the vote represented the prevailing wish in Bessarabia and that the events leading to the unification indicate there was no question of a "seizure", but a voluntary act on the part of its people.<ref>Bernard Newman, "The new Europe", p. 245</ref>

Quoting [[Emmanuel de Martonne]], historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] mentions that, around the time of the union, Bessarabian peasants "still called thesemlves Moldovans". She adds [[Ion Nistor]]'s explanation from 1915 of a similar earlier phenomenon in the Austrian-ruled [[Bukovina]], where peasants had called themselves Moldovans but "under the influence of the [Romanian] literary language, the term 'Moldovan' was then replaced by 'Romanian'", while "in Bessarabia this influence has not penetrated yet"<ref>Livezeanu, Irina. ''Cultura si Nationalism in Romania Mare 1918-1930''. 1998 p.115</ref>

After the unification, a few French and Romanian military reports from the period mentioned the reticence or hostility of the Bessarabian ethnic minorities, at times together with Moldovans, towards the new Romanian administration.<ref>Livezeanu, Irina. ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle, 1918-1930''. [[Cornell University Press]], 2000. pp. 98-99</ref> Livezeanu also notes that, at the beginning, the Moldovan urban elite educated under Russian rule spoke predominantly Russian, and despised Romania as "uncivilized" and the culture of its elite, of which it knew very little.<ref>Livezeanu, Irina. ''Cultura si Nationalism in Romania Mare''. [[Humanitas 1998]], p.123 "rusa era considerata adevarata limba publica a elitei urbane si a birocratiei. Moldovenii ce devenisera parte a acestei elite sub carmuirea ruseasca, desi nu-si uitasera neaparat limba materna, n-o mai foloseau in afara relatiilor de familie. Faptul ca moldovenii aveau un precar al identitatii culturale romanesti se reflecta in dispretul lor fata de Romania, tara pe care multi dintre ei o priveau ca <necivilizata>. De asemenea dispretuiau cultura elitelor din Romania, desi o cunosteau foarte putin, sau poate tocmai de aceea"</ref>

Owing partly to its relative underdevelopment compared to other regions of [[Greater Romania]], as well as to the low competence and corruption of some of the new Romanian administration in this province, the process of "turning Bessarabian peasants into Romanians" was less successful than in other regions and was soon to be disrupted by the Soviet occupation.<ref name="CharlesKing">Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000</ref><ref name="PetrescuCristina_a">Petrescu, Cristina. ''Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans'' in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian & Hungarian Case Studies''. Editura [[Polirom]]. 2001. p. 154</ref> Cristina Petrescu thinks that the transition between the Tsarist-type of local administration to the centralized Romanian administration alienated many Moldovans, and many of them felt they were rather occupied than united with "their alleged brothers".<ref>Petrescu, Cristina. ''Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans'' in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian & Hungarian Case Studies''. Editura [[Polirom]]. 2001. p. 157</ref> Based on the stories told by a group of Bessarabians from the villages of the Balti county, who, notably, chose to move to Romania rather than live under the Soviet regime, Cristina Petrescu suggests that Bessarabia seems to be only region of the Greater Romania where the central authorities did not succeed "in integrating their own coethnics", most of whom "did not even begin to consider themselves part of the Romanian nation, going beyond their allegiance to regional and local ties" .<ref name="PetrescuCristina_a" />

===Bessarabia within the Soviet Union (1940<U+2013>1992)===
In 1940, Bessarabia, along with northern [[Bukovina]], was [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|incorporated]] into the [[USSR]] following an ultimatum sent to the Romanian government. The Soviet authorities took several steps to emphasize the distinction between the Moldovans and the Romanians, at times using the physical elimination of pan-Romanian supporters, deemed as "[[enemies of the people]]".<ref>Bugai, Nikolai F.: Deportatsiya narodov iz Ukainyi, Belorussii i Moldavii - Deportation of the peoples from Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. Druzhba Narodov, Moscow 1998, Dittmar Dahlmann & Gerhard Hirschfeld. - Essen 1999, pp. 567-581</ref> They were repressed by the [[NKVD]] and [[KGB]] for their "bourgeois nationalism".<ref>John Barron, The KGB, Reader's Digest inc., 1974, ISBN 0-88349-009-9</ref> The [[Soviet propaganda]] also sought to secure a separate status for the varieties of the Romanian language spoken in the USSR. Thus, it imposed the use of a [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]] derived from the Russian alphabet, and promoted the exclusive use of the name "Moldovan language", forbidding the use of the name "Romanian language". The harsh anti-Romanian Soviet policy left a trace on the identity of Moldovans.<ref name="CharlesKing" />

In most such cases, the tension seems to be between a stronger local identity and a weaker but wider identity.
