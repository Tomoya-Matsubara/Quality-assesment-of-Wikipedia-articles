'''Umbriel''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8><U+028C>mbri<U+0259>l}})<ref name=trans group=note/> is a [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Uranus]] discovered on October 24, 1851, by [[William Lassell]].  It was discovered at the same time as [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] and named after a character in [[Alexander Pope]]'s poem ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of [[rock (geology)|rock]], and may be differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] and an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early [[Endogenic and exogenic|endogenic]] processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface. 

Covered by numerous [[impact crater]]s reaching {{convert|210|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, Umbriel is the second most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]]. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]] crater. This moon, like all moons of Uranus, probably formed from an [[accretion disk]] that surrounded the planet just after its formation. The Uranian system has been studied up close only once: by the spacecraft ''[[Voyager 2]]'' in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon<U+2019>s surface.

==Discovery and name==
Umbriel, along with another Uranian satellite [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], was discovered by [[William Lassell]] on October 24, 1851.<ref name=Lassell1851/><ref name=Lassell1851b/> Although [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], claimed at the end of the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus,<ref name=Herschel3/> his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.<ref name=Struve1848/>  

All Uranus's moons are named after characters created by [[William Shakespeare]] or [[Alexander Pope]]. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by [[John Herschel]] in 1852 at the request of Lassell.<ref name=Lassell5/> Umbriel is the 'dusky melancholy sprite' in Alexander Pope's ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'',<ref name=Kuiper1949/> and the name suggests the [[Latin]] ''[[umbra]]'', meaning ''shadow''. <!--The adjectival form of the name is ''Umbrielian''.--> The moon is also designated '''Uranus&nbsp;II'''.<ref name=Lassell1851b/>

==Orbit==
Umbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about {{convert|266000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, being the third farthest from the planet among its [[moons of Uranus|five major moons]].{{#tag:ref|The five major moons are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], Umbriel, Titania and Oberon.|group=note}} Umbriel's orbit has a small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] very little relative to the [[equator]] of Uranus.<ref name=orbit/> Its [[orbital period]] is around 4.1&nbsp;Earth days, coincident with its [[rotational period]]. In other words, Umbriel is a [[synchronous orbit|synchronous]] or [[tidally locked]] satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.<ref name=Smith1986/> Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the [[Magnetosphere of Uranus|Uranian magnetosphere]].<ref name=Grundy2006/> This is important, because the trailing [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispheres]] of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel ) are struck by magnetospheric [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which co-rotates with the planet.<ref name=Ness1986/> This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).<ref name=Grundy2006/> Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.<ref name=Krimigis1986/> 

Because Uranus orbits the [[Sun]] almost on its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's equatorial plane, they (including Umbriel) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Geographic poles|poles]] spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the [[zenith]] over one of the poles at each [[solstice]].<ref name=Grundy2006/> The ''Voyager 2'' flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was unilluminated. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an [[equinox]] and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual [[occultation]]s of Uranus's moons become possible. In 2007&ndash;2008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of Titania by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8, 2007 as well as of Ariel by Umbriel on August 19, 2007.<ref name=occultations/>

Currently Umbriel is not involved in any [[orbital resonance]] with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in the 3:1 resonance with [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], which was partially responsible for the heating of that moon.<ref name=Tittemore1990/>

==Composition and internal structure==
Umbriel is the third largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons.{{#tag:ref|Due to the current [[observational error]], it is not yet known for certain whether [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]] is more massive than Umbriel.<ref name=JPLSSD/>|group=note}} The moon's density is 1.39&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>,<ref name=Jacobson1992/> which indicates that it mainly consists of [[Ice|water ice]], while a dense non-ice component constitutes around 40% of its mass.<ref name=Hassmann2006/> The latter could be made of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[carbonaceous]] material including heavy [[organic compound]]s known as [[tholin]]s.<ref name=Smith1986/> The presence of water ice is supported by [[infrared]] [[spectroscopic]] observations, which have revealed [[crystalline]] water ice on the surface of the moon.<ref name=Grundy2006/> Water ice [[absorption band]]s are stronger on Umbriel's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere.<ref name=Grundy2006/> The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the [[magnetosphere of Uranus]], which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).<ref name=Grundy2006/> The energetic particles tend to [[sputtering|sputter]] water ice, decompose [[methane]] trapped in ice as [[clathrate hydrate]] and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] behind.<ref name=Grundy2006/>

Except for water, the only other compound identified on the surface of Umbriel by the infrared spectroscopy is [[carbon dioxide]], which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere.<ref name=Grundy2006/> The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from [[carbonate]]s or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus or the solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the [[outgassing]] of the [[Primordial element|primordial]] CO<sub>2</sub> trapped by water ice in Umbriel's interior. The escape of CO<sub>2</sub> from the interior may be related to the past geological activity on this moon.<ref name=Grundy2006/>

Umbriel may be differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] surrounded by an icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name=Hassmann2006/> If this is the case, the radius of the core (317&nbsp;km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon<U+2019>s mass&mdash;the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure in the center of Umbriel is about 0.24&nbsp;[[GPa]] (2.4&nbsp;[[kbar]]).<ref name=Hassmann2006/> The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.<ref name=Hassmann2006/>

==Surface features==
[[File:Umbriel usgs.jpg|thumb|right|The map of Umbriel showing polygons|alt=A spherical blueish body with its surface covered by craters and polygons. The lower right part is smooth.]]

Umbriel's surface is the darkest of the Uranian moons, and reflects less than half as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size.<ref name=JPLSSD/> Umbriel has a very low [[Bond albedo]] of only about 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel.<ref name=Karkoschka2001a/> The reflectivity of the moon's surface  decreases from 26% at a phase angle of 0<U+00B0> ([[albedo|geometrical albedo]]) to 19% at an angle of about 1<U+00B0>. This phenomenon is called [[opposition surge]]. Opposite to what is observed for another dark Uranian moon, Oberon, the surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color,<ref name=Bell1991/> while fresh bright impact deposits (in [[Wunda (crater)|Wunda]] crater, for instance)<ref name=Plescia1987/> are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter.<ref name=Buratti1991/> The reddening of the surfaces probably results from [[space weathering]] from bombardment by charged particles and [[Micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]] over the age of the [[Solar System]].<ref name=Bell1991/> However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from [[irregular satellite]]s, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.<ref name=Buratti1991/> The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous<U+2014>it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color.<ref name=Bell1991/> 

Scientists have so far recognized only one class of geological feature on Umbriel<U+2014>[[Impact crater|craters]].<ref name=usgs/> The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and is also the least geologically active.<ref name=Plescia1987/> In fact only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters range from a few kilometers at the low end to 210&nbsp;kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo.<ref name=Plescia1987/><ref name=usgs/> All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks,<ref name=Plescia1987/> but no crater has [[Ray system|rays]].<ref name=Smith1986/>

Near Umbriel's equator lies the most prominent surface feature: Wunda crater, which has a diameter of about 131&nbsp;km.<ref name=usgsWunda/><ref name="hunt"/> Wunda has a large ring of bright material on its floor, which appears to be an impact deposit.<ref name=Plescia1987/> Nearby, seen along the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], are the craters [[Vuver (crater)|Vuver]] and [[Skynd (crater)|Skynd]], which lack bright rims but possess bright central peaks.<ref name=Smith1986/><ref name="hunt"/> Study of limb profiles of Umbriel revealed a possible very large impact feature having the diameter of about 400&nbsp;km and depth of approximately 5&nbsp;km.<ref name=Moore2004/>

Much like other moons of Uranus, the surface of Umbriel is cut by a system of canyons trending northeast<U+2013>southwest.<ref name=Croft1989/> They are not, however, officially recognized due to the poor resolution of images and generally bland appearance of this moon, which hinders [[Geologic map|geological mapping]].<ref name=Plescia1987/>

Umbriel's heavily cratered surface has probably been stable since the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].<ref name=Plescia1987/> The only signs of the ancient internal activity are canyons and dark polygons<U+2014>dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds kilometers across.<ref name=Helfenstein1989/> The polygons were identified from the precise photometry of Voyager's images and are distributed more or less uniformly on the surface of Umbriel trending northeast<U+2013>southwest. Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of tectonic activity.<ref name=Helfenstein1989/> Currently there is no explanation of why Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance. Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material (so called ''[[umbra]]l material'') excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption.{{#tag:ref|While a co-orbiting population of dust particles is another possible source of the dark material, this is considered less likely because other satellites were not affected.<ref name=Smith1986/>|group=note}}<ref name=Buratti1991/> Alternatively, Umbriel's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material, which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays. However, the presence of the bright Wunda feature seems to contradict this hypothesis.<ref name=Smith1986/>

==Origin and evolution==
Umbriel is thought to have formed from an [[accretion disc]] or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large [[Axial tilt|obliquity]].<ref name=Mousis2004/> The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the [[moons of Saturn]] indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor.{{#tag:ref|For instance, [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], a Saturnian moon, has the density of 0.97&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which means that it contains more than 90% of water.<ref name=Grundy2006/>|group=note}}<ref name=Smith1986/> Significant amounts of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] may have been present in the form of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[nitrogen|molecular nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) instead of [[ammonia]] and methane.<ref name=Mousis2004/> The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N<sub>2</sub> trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.<ref name=Smith1986/>

Umbriel's accretion probably lasted for several thousand years.<ref name=Mousis2004/> The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer.<ref name=Squyres1988/> The maximum temperature of around 180&nbsp;K was reached at the depth of about 3&nbsp;km.<ref name=Squyres1988/> After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Umbriel heated due to decay of [[radioactivity|radioactive elements]] present in its rocks.<ref name=Smith1986/> The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong [[Stress (mechanics)|extensional stresses]] in the moon's crust, which may have led to cracking.<ref name=Hillier1991/> This process probably lasted for about 200&nbsp;million years, implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions years ago.<ref name=Smith1986/>

The initial [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretional heating]] together with continued decay of radioactive elements may have led to melting of the ice<ref name=Squyres1988/> if an [[antifreeze]] like ammonia (in the form of [[hydrate|ammonia hydrate]]) or some [[salt]] was present.<ref name=Hassmann2006/> The melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle.<ref name=Plescia1987/> A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core<U+2013>mantle boundary. The [[eutectic temperature]] of this mixture is 176&nbsp;K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago.<ref name=Hassmann2006/> Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes,<ref name=Plescia1987/> although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.<ref name=Helfenstein1989/>

==Exploration==
{{mainarticle|Exploration of Uranus}}
So far the only close-up images of Umbriel have been from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between Voyager 2 and Umbriel was {{convert|325000|km|mi|abbr=on}},<ref name=Stone1987/> the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 5.2&nbsp;km.<ref name=Plescia1987/> The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 20% was photographed with the quality required for [[geological mapping]].<ref name=Plescia1987/> At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of Umbriel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied.<ref name=Smith1986/> No other spacecraft has ever visited Uranus (and Umbriel), and no mission to Uranus and its moons is planned.
