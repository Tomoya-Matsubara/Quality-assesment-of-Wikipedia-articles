'''Status epilepticus''' (SE) refers to a life threatening condition in which the [[brain]] is in a state of persistent [[seizure]].  Definitions vary, but traditionally it is defined as one continuous seizure or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than 30 minutes. Many doctors, however, believe that 5 minutes is sufficient to damage neurons and that seizures are unlikely to self-terminate by that time.

In known epileptics, this condition is associated with poor [[compliance (medicine)|compliance]] (adherence to medication regimen), [[alcohol]] withdrawal, and [[metabolism|metabolic]] disturbances.  As a primary presentation it normally indicates a [[tumour]] or [[abscess]].

It can also be induced by [[nerve agent]]s such as [[soman]].<ref name="soman">{{cite journal | first = John H. | last = McDonough | coauthors = A. Benjamin, Joseph D.

==Variants==
Status epilepticus can be divided into two categories&mdash;convulsive and nonconvulsive, the latter of which is underdiagnosed.
===Convulsive===
[[Epilepsia partialis continua]] is a variant involving [[hour]], [[day]], or even [[week]]-long jerking. It is a consequence of [[vascular disease]], [[tumour]]s, or [[encephalitis]], and is drug-resistant.

Generalized [[myoclonus]] is commonly seen in [[coma]]tose patients following [[CPR]] and is seen by some as an indication of catastrophic damage to the [[neocortex]].<ref name="gen-myo-se">{{cite journal | first = Eelco F. M. | last = Wijdicks | coauthors = Parisi JE, Sharbrough FW | month = February | year = 1994 | title = Prognostic value of myoclonus status in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 239<U+2013>43 | pmid =8109907}}</ref>

===Nonconvulsive===
[[Complex partial status epilepticus]], or CPSE, and [[absence status epilepticus]] are rare forms of the condition which are marked by nonconvulsive seizures. In the case of CPSE, the seizure is confined to a small area of the brain, normally the temporal lobe. But the latter, absence status epilepticus, is marked by a generalised seizure affecting the whole brain, and an [[Electroencephalogram|EEG]] is needed to differentiate between the two conditions. This results in episodes characterized by a long-lasting stupor, staring and unresponsiveness.

==Treatments==
===Benzodiazepines===
Shortly after it was introduced in 1963, [[diazepam]] became the first choice for SE. Even though other [[benzodiazepine]]s such as [[clonazepam]] were useful, diazepam was relied upon almost exclusively. This began to change in 1975 with a preliminary study on [[lorazepam]] conducted by 
Waltregny and Dargent, who found that its pharmacological effects were longer lasting than those of an equal dose of diazepam.<ref name="waltdar">{{cite journal | first = Alain | last = Waltregny | coauthors = J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Dargent | month = September/October | year = 1975 | title = Preliminary study of parenteral lorazepam in status epilepticus | journal = Acta Neurologica Belgica | volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages = 219<U+2013>29 | pmid = 3939}}</ref> This meant it did not have to be repeatedly injected like diazepam,<ref name="lorazepam1979">{{cite journal | first = JE | last = Walker | coauthors = RW Homan, MR Vasko, IL Crawford, RD Bell, WG Tasker | month = September | year = 1979 | title = Lorazepam in status epilepticus | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 207<U+2013>13 | pmid = 43112}}</ref> the effects of which would wear off 5<U+2013>15 minutes later in spite of its 30-hour [[half-life]] (due to extensive redistribution of diazepam outside the vascular compartment as diazepam is highly lipid soluble). It has also been found that patients who were first tried on diazepam were much more likely to require [[tracheotomy|endotracheal tubing]] than patients who were first tried on [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]],<ref name="vspbandpht">{{cite journal | first = Richard A. | last = Orr | coauthors = Robert J.

Today, the benzodiazepine of choice is [[lorazepam]] for initial treatment due to its long (2<U+2013>8 hour) duration of action and rapid onset of action, thought to be due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and to its low lipid solubility which causes it to remain in the vascular compartment.  If lorazepam is not available, then diazepam should be given.<ref name="benzo-of-choice">{{cite journal | first = Trudy | last = Pang | coauthors = Lawrence J. Hirsch | month = July | year = 2005 | title = Treatment of Convulsive and Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus | journal = Current Treatment Options in Neurology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 247<U+2013>259 | pmid = 15967088 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=15967088&dopt=ExternalLink}}</ref> Sometimes, the failure of lorazepam alone is considered to be enough to classify a case of SE as [[Wiktionary:refractory|refractory]].

===Phenytoin and fosphenytoin===
Phenytoin was once another first-line therapy, although the [[prodrug]] [[fosphenytoin]] can be administered three times as fast and with far fewer injection site reactions. If these or any other [[hydantoin|hydantoin derivative]]s are used, then cardiac monitoring is a must if they are administered intravenously. Because the hydantoins take 15<U+2013>30 minutes to work, a benzodiazepine or barbiturate is often co-administered. Because of diazepam's short duration of action, they were often administered together anyway.

===Barbiturates===
Before the benzodiazepines were invented, there were the barbiturates, which are still used today if benzodiazepines or the hydantoins are not an option. These are used to induce a  [[barbiturate|barbituric]] coma. The barbiturate most commonly used for this is phenobarbital. [[Thiopental]] or [[pentobarbital]] may also be used for that purpose if the seizures have to be stopped immediately or if the patient has already been compromised by the underlying illness or toxic/metabolic-induced seizures; however, in those situations, thiopental is the agent of choice.

The failure of phenobarbital therapy does not preclude the success of a lengthy comatose state induced by a stronger barbiturate such as [[secobarbital]]. Such was the case for Ohori, Fujioka, and Ohta ca. 1998, when they induced a 10-month long coma (or "anesthesia" as they called it) in a 26-year-old woman suffering from refractory status epilepticus secondary to [[encephalitis|viral encephalitis]] and then tapered her off the secobarbital very slowly while using [[zonisamide]] at the same time.<ref name="secobarbitalofo">{{cite journal | first = Nobuhira | last = Ohori | coauthors = Fujioka Y, Ohta M. | month = May | year = 1998 | title = [Experience in managing refractory status epilepticus caused by viral encephalitis under long-term anesthesia with barbiturate: a case report] | journal = Rinsho Shinkeigaku | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 474<U+2013>7 | pmid = 9806000}} (Japanese)</ref>

===General anesthetics===
If this proves ineffective or if barbiturates cannot be used for some reason, then a [[general anesthetic]] such as [[propofol]]<ref name="propofol">{{cite journal | first = X | last = Pourrat | coauthors = JM Serekian, D Antier, J. Grassin | title = [Generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus: therapeutic strategy] | journal = Presse M<U+00E9>dicale | volume = 30 | issue = | date = June 9, 2001 | pages = 1031<U+2013>6 | pmid = 11433696}} (French).</ref> is tried; sometimes it is used second after the failure of [[lorazepam]].<ref name="propofol2">{{cite journal | first = Paul E. | last = Marik | coauthors = Joseph Varon | title = The management of status epilepticus | journal = Chest | year = 2004 | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 582<U+2013>91 | pmid = 15302747 | url = http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/126/2/582}}</ref> This also means putting the patient on artificial respiration. Propofol has been shown to be effective in suppressing the jerks seen in myoclonus status epilepticus, but [[as of 2002]], there have been no cases of anyone going into myoclonus status epilepticus, undergoing propofol treatment, and then not dying anyway.<ref name="propofolmse">{{cite journal | first = Eelco F.M. | last = Wijdicks | year = 2002 | month = July | title = Propofol in myoclonus status epilepticus in comatose patients following cardiac resuscitation | journal = Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 94<U+2013>5 | pmid = 12082068 | url = http://jnnp.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/73/1/94}}</ref>

===Lidocaine===
