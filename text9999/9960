The red ribbon is a symbol for drunk driving prevention, drug prevention, and for the fight against [[AIDS]]. The Red Ribbon Foundation and [http://www.madd.org/ Mothers Against Drunk Driving] (MADD) are examples of organizations that utilize the red ribbon symbol.  MADD is an organization founded in 1980 whose mission is to stop drunk driving, support the victims of this violent crime and prevent underage drinking.  Red Ribbon International is an organization founded in 1993 whose main purpose is the education about prevention of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Related Complex, ARC and AIDS.

===Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Origins===
In 1986, MADD started the [http://www.madd.org/feature-stories/november/tie-one-on-for-madd.html Tie One On For Safety] campaign. It is MADD<U+2019>s longest running and most visible public awareness project. During the holiday season, drivers are encouraged to tie MADD red ribbons to visible locations on their vehicles, or place window decals on their vehicles<U+2019> windows. The red ribbons represent the drivers<U+2019> commitment to drive safe, sober and buckled up.  It also encourages others to designate a sober driver before drinking.

===Alcohol, tobacco and other drug prevention awareness origin===

===AIDS awareness origin===
The Red Ribbon Project was created by the New York-based Visual AIDS Artists Caucus in 1991.<ref>[http://www.visualaids.org/projects/detail/the-red-ribbon-project Visual AIDS]</ref>
# Remain anonymous as individuals and to credit the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus as a whole in the creation of the Red Ribbon Project, and not to list any individual as the creator of the Red Ribbon Project;
# Keep the image copyright free, so that no individual or organization would profit from the use of the red ribbon;
# The Red Ribbon should be used as a consciousness raising symbol, not as a commercial or trademark tool.

The artists who formed the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus wished to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and their caregivers.  Inspired by the yellow ribbons honoring American soldiers serving in the Gulf war, the color red was chosen for its, "connection to blood and the idea of passion -- not only anger, but love, like a valentine." First worn publicly by [[Jeremy Irons]] at the 1991 Tony Awards,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=-wWieD-pGIoC&pg=PA22&dq=red+ribbon+jeremy+irons&hl=en&ei=xIo2TaLBCMuq8AO6rvGlBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=red%20ribbon%20jeremy%20irons&f=false Ribbon: The Art of Adornment] p.22. Gibbs Smith, 2008</ref> the ribbon soon became renowned as an international symbol of AIDS awareness.

At the ''[[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]'' held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], London on Easter Sunday 1992, more than 100,000 red ribbons were distributed among the audience by Red Ribbon International, with performers such as [[George Michael]] wearing one.<ref>Sander L. Gilman ''Diseases & diagnoses: the second age of biology'' p.50. Transaction Publishers, 2010</ref><ref>Sarah E. H. Moore (2008) ''Ribbon culture: charity, compassion, and public awareness'' p.74. Palgrave Macmillan,</ref> The Red Ribbon continues to be a powerful force in the fight to increase public awareness of HIV/AIDS and in the lobbying efforts to increase funding for AIDS services and research.

To symbolize the United States' commitment to combat the world AIDS epidemic, President [[George W. Bush]]'s administration began displaying a 28-foot AIDS Ribbon on the [[White House]]'s iconic North Portico on [[World AIDS Day]] 2007.<ref>"Two-Story AIDS Ribbon at White House," ABC News, Nov. 30, 2007, http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2007/11/the-2-story-tal/</ref><ref>"White House Marks World AIDS Day," New York Times, Nov. 30, 2009, http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/white-house-marks-world-aids-day/</ref> The display, now an annual tradition, quickly garnered attention, as it was the first banner, sign or symbol to prominently hang from the White House since [[Abraham Lincoln]] lived in the building.
