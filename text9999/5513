'''Yana Lumb''' is a recurring character in [[ITV1]]'s ''[[Coronation Street]]'', portrayed by [[Jayne Bickerton]]. She is [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]]'s best friend and in a way is usually involved in Cilla's scams and plots. Yana works with Cilla in Wong's chip shop around the corner from The Street. 

Yana ended up going on Cilla's honeymoon with her instead of Les, who was in trouble with Cilla for trashing all the wedding presents at the reception.

Yana took pity on Les in late November 2006, when he revealed his suspicions of Cilla having an affair, and slept with him, only to be seen by Cilla's son, [[Chesney Battersby-Brown]].  Cilla soon found out about the affair, and pretended she had cancer. She forced Yana and Les to sit in a bathtub of mushy peas on Christmas Eve to raise money for Cilla's holiday fund to [[Florida]]. Before she left, she revealed the truth.

Returning in December, Cilla slapped Yana and forgave her.
