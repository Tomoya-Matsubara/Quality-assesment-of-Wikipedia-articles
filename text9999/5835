'''Callisto''' is a [[Moons of Jupiter|moon of the planet Jupiter]], ({{pron-en|k<U+0259><U+02C8>l<U+026A>sto<U+028A>}},<ref>In US dictionary transcription, {{USdict|k<U+0259><U+00B7>l<U+012D>s<U+2032><U+00B7>t<U+014D>}}.</ref> named after the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] mythological figure of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], {{lang-el|''<U+039A><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03CE>''}}) . It was discovered in 1610 by [[Galileo Galilei]].<ref name=Galilei>Galilei, G.; [http://www.physics.emich.edu/jwooley/chapter9/Chapter9.html ''Sidereus Nuncius''] (March 13, 1610)</ref> It is the [[List of moons#Moons of planets and dwarf planets|third-largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]] and the second largest in the Jovian system, after [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Callisto has about 99% the diameter of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] but only about a third of its mass. It is the fourth [[Galilean moon]] of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] by distance, with an orbital radius of about 1,880,000&nbsp;km.<ref name=orbit/> It does not form part of the [[orbital resonance]] that affects three inner Galilean satellites<U+2014>[[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]<U+2014>and thus does not experience appreciable [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal heating|tidal heating]].<ref name=Musotto2002/> Callisto [[synchronous rotation|rotates synchronously]] with its orbital period, so the same hemisphere always faces (is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] to) Jupiter. Callisto's surface is less affected by Jupiter's [[magnetosphere]] than the other [[inner satellite]]s because it orbits farther away.<ref name=Cooper2001/>

Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[Volatiles|ice]]s, with a mean [[density]] of about 1.83&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Compounds detected [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] on the surface include [[ice|water ice]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[silicate]]s, and [[organic compound]]s. Investigation by the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft revealed that Callisto may have a small [[silicate]] [[Planetary core|core]] and possibly a subsurface [[ocean]] of liquid [[water]] at depths greater than 100&nbsp;km.<ref name=Kuskov2005/><ref name=Showman1999/>

The surface of Callisto is heavily [[impact crater|cratered]] and extremely old. It does not show any signatures of [[endogenic|subsurface]] processes such as [[plate tectonics]] or [[volcano|volcanism]], and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of [[impact crater|impacts]].<ref name="Greeley 2000"/> Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped [[impact crater]]s, and chains of craters (''catenae'') and associated [[escarpment|scarps]], ridges and deposits.<ref name="Greeley 2000"/> At a small scale, the surface is varied and consists of small, bright frost [[deposit (geology)|deposits]] at the tops of elevations, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material.<ref name=Moore2004/> This is thought to result from the [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]]-driven degradation of small [[landform]]s, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants.<ref name=Moore1999/> The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.

Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin [[atmosphere]] composed of [[carbon dioxide]]<ref name="Carlson 1999"/> and probably [[molecular oxygen]],<ref name="Liang 2005"/> as well as by a rather intense [[ionosphere]].<ref name="Kliore 2002"/> Callisto is thought to have formed by slow [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation.<ref name=Canup2002/> Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal heating|tidal heating]] meant that not enough heat was available for rapid [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]]. The slow [[convection]] in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100&ndash;150&nbsp;km and a small, rocky [[planetary core|core]].<ref name="Spohn 2003"/>

The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto leaves open the possibility that it could harbor [[extraterrestrial life|life]]. However, conditions are thought to be less favorable than on nearby [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].<ref name=Lipps2004/> Various space probes from ''[[Pioneer 10|Pioneers 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'' to ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' and ''[[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens|Cassini]]'' have studied the moon. Because of its low [[radiation]] levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jovian system.<ref name=HOPE/>

==Discovery and naming==
Callisto was discovered by Galileo in January 1610 along with three other large Jovian moons<U+2014>[[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].<ref name=Galilei/> Callisto is named after one of [[Zeus]]'s many lovers in [[Greek mythology]]. [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] was a nymph (or, according to some sources, the daughter of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]]) who was associated with the goddess of the hunt, [[Artemis]].<ref name=Galileo/> The name was suggested by [[Simon Marius]] soon after the moon's discovery.<ref name=Marius>{{cite book|author=[[Marius, S.]]|title=[[Mundus Iovialis]] anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/marius.html|year=1614}}</ref> Marius attributed the suggestion to [[Johannes Kepler]].<ref name=Galileo>{{cite web|title=Satellites of Jupiter|publisher=The Galileo Project| url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/jupiter_satellites.html|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> However, the names of the [[Galilean moons|Galilean satellites]] fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not revived in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Callisto is referred to by its Roman numeral designation, a system introduced by Galileo, as '''{{nowrap|Jupiter IV}}''' or as "the fourth satellite of Jupiter".<ref name=Barnard1892>{{cite journal|last=Barnard|first=E. E.|url= http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/AJ.../0012//0000081.000.html|title=Discovery and Observation of a Fifth Satellite to Jupiter|journal=Astronomical Journal|volume=12|year=1892|pages=81&ndash;85|doi=10.1086/101715}}</ref> In scientific writing, the adjectival form of the name is ''Callistoan,''<ref name=Klemaszewski2001>{{cite web|last= Klemaszewski|first= J.A.|coauthors= Greeley, R.|title= Geological Evidence for an Ocean on Callisto |year=2001|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI|page=1818|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2001/pdf/1818.pdf|format=pdf}}</ref> {{pron-en|<U+02CC>k<U+00E6>l<U+0268><U+02C8>sto<U+028A>.<U+0259>n}}, or ''Callistan.''<ref name=Moore1999/>

==Orbit and rotation==
[[Image:001221 Cassini Jupiter & Europa & Callisto.jpg|left|thumb|Callisto (bottom left), Jupiter (top right) and Europa (below and left of Jupiter's [[Great Red Spot]]) as viewed by ''[[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens|Cassini]]'']]
Callisto is the outermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits at a distance of approximately 1&nbsp;880&nbsp;000&nbsp;km (26.3 times the 71&nbsp;492&nbsp;km radius of Jupiter itself).<ref name=orbit>{{cite web|title=Planetary Satellite Mean Orbital Parameters|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem}}</ref> This is significantly larger than the orbital radius&mdash;1&nbsp;070&nbsp;000&nbsp;km&mdash;of the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede. As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in the [[orbital resonance|mean-motion resonance]]<U+2014>in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked<U+2014>and probably never has.<ref name=Musotto2002>{{cite journal|last=Musotto|first=Susanna|coauthors=Varadi, Ferenc; Moore, William; Schubert, Gerald|title=Numerical Simulations of the Orbits of the Galilean Satellites|year=2002|volume=159|pages=500&ndash;504|doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6939| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Icar..159..500M | journal = Icarus}}</ref>

Like most other regular planetary moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be [[synchronous rotation|synchronous]] with its orbit.<ref name="Anderson 2001"/> The length of the Callistoan day, simultaneously its [[orbital period]], is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian [[equator]], with the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]] changing [[almost periodic function|quasi-periodic]]ally due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0072&ndash;0.0076 and 0.20&ndash;0.60<U+00B0>, respectively.<ref name=Musotto2002/> These orbital variations cause the [[axial tilt]] (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6<U+00B0>.<ref name=Bills2005>{{cite journal|last=Bills|first=Bruce G.|title=Free and forced obliquities of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter|year=2005|volume=175|pages=233&ndash;247|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.10.028| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005Icar..175..233B | journal = Icarus}}</ref>

The dynamical isolation of Callisto means that it has never been appreciably [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal heating|tidally heated]], which has had important consequences for its internal structure and [[evolution]].<ref name=Freeman2006/> Its distance from Jupiter also means that the [[charged particle|charged-particle]] [[flux]] from the planet's [[magnetosphere]] at its surface is relatively low&mdash;about 300 times lower than, for example, that at [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. Hence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle [[irradiation]] has had a relatively minor effect on the Callistoan surface.<ref name=Cooper2001>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=John F.|coauthors=Johnson, Robert E.; Mauk, Barry H.; et al.|title=Energetic Ion and Electron Irradiation of the Icy Galilean Satellites|year=2001|volume=139|pages=133&ndash;159|doi=10.1006/icar.2000.6498| url=http://icymoons.com/europaclass/Cooper_gllsat_irrad.pdf|format=pdf | journal = Icarus}}</ref> The radiation level at the surface of Callisto is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 [[R<U+00F6>ntgen equivalent man|rem]] (0.1 [[millisievert|mSv]]) per day.<ref name="ringwald">{{cite web |date=2000-02-29 |title=SPS 1020 (Introduction to Space Sciences) |publisher=California State University, Fresno |author=Frederick A.

The average [[density]] of Callisto, 1.83&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>,<ref name="Anderson 2001"/> suggests a composition of approximately equal parts of rocky material and [[ice|water ice]], with some additional volatile ices such as [[ammonia]].<ref name=Kuskov2005>{{cite journal|last=Kuskov|first=O.L.|coauthors=Kronrod, V.A.|title=Internal structure of Europa and Callisto|year=2005|volume=177|pages=550&ndash;369|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.04.014| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005Icar..177..550K | journal = Icarus}}</ref> The mass fraction of ices is between 49<U+2013>55%.<ref name=Kuskov2005/><ref name="Spohn 2003"/> The exact composition of Callisto's [[Rock (geology)|rock]] component is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type [[ordinary chondrite]]s, which are characterized by less total [[iron]], less metallic iron and more [[iron oxide]] than [[H chondrite]]s. The weight ratio of iron to [[silicon]] is 0.9:1.3 in Callisto, whereas the [[Sun|solar ratio]] is around 1:8.<ref name=Kuskov2005/>

Callisto's surface has an [[albedo]] of about 20%.<ref name=Moore2004/> Its surface composition is thought to be broadly similar to its composition as a whole.

The Callistoan surface is asymmetric: the leading hemisphere&mdash;the hemisphere facing the direction of the orbital motion{{Ref_label|G|g|none}}&mdash;is darker than the trailing one. This is different from other [[Galilean satellites]], where the reverse is true.<ref name=Moore2004/> The trailing hemisphere{{Ref_label|G|g|none}} of Callisto appears to be enriched in [[carbon dioxide]], while the leading hemisphere has more [[sulfur dioxide]].<ref name=Hibbitts1998>{{cite web|last=Hibbitts |first=C.A.|coauthors=McCord, T.

[[Valhalla (crater)|Valhalla]] is the largest, with a bright central region 600&nbsp;kilometers in diameter, and rings extending as far as 1,800&nbsp;kilometers from the center (see figure).<ref name="Map 2002">{{cite map|title=Controlled Photomosaic Map of Callisto JC 15M CMN |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |edition=2002 |url=http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/i-map/i2770/}}</ref> The second largest is [[Asgard (crater)|Asgard]], measuring about 1,600&nbsp;kilometers in diameter.<ref name="Map 2002"/> Multi-ring structures probably originated as a result of a post-impact [[concentric]] fracturing of the lithosphere lying on a layer of soft or liquid material, possibly an ocean.<ref name=Klemaszewski2001/> The catenae&mdash;for example [[Gomul Catena]]&mdash;are long chains of impact craters lined up in straight lines across the surface. They were probably created by objects that were tidally disrupted as they passed close to Jupiter prior to the impact on Callisto, or by very [[wikt:oblique|oblique]] impacts.<ref name="Greeley 2000"/>  A historical example of a disruption was [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]].

As mentioned above, small patches of pure water ice with an [[albedo]] as high as 80% are found on the surface of Callisto, surrounded by much darker material.<ref name=Moore2004/> High-resolution ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: [[rim (craters)|crater rims]], [[Escarpment|scarps]], ridges and knobs.<ref name=Moore2004/> They are likely to be thin [[frost|water frost]] [[deposit (geology)|deposits]]. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5&nbsp;km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.<ref name=Moore2004/>

On a sub-kilometer scale the surface of Callisto is more degraded than the surfaces of other icy [[Galilean moons]].<ref name=Moore2004/> Typically there is a deficit of small impact craters with diameters less than 1&nbsp;km as compared with, for instance, the dark plains on [[ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].<ref name="Greeley 2000"/> Instead of small craters, the almost ubiquitous surface features are small knobs and pits.<ref name=Moore2004/> The knobs are thought to represent remnants of crater rims degraded by an as-yet uncertain process.<ref name=Moore1999>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Jeffrey M.|coauthors=Asphaug, Erik; Morrison, David; et al.|title=Mass Movement and Landform Degradation on the Icy Galilean Satellites: Results of the Galileo Nominal Mission|year=1999|volume=140 |pages=294&ndash;312|doi=10.1006/icar.1999.6132|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999Icar..140..294M | journal = Icarus}}</ref> The most likely candidate process is the slow [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] of ice, which is enabled by a temperature of up to 165&nbsp;[[kelvin|K]], reached at a subsolar point.<ref name=Moore2004/> Such sublimation of water or other [[volatiles]] from the dirty ice that is the [[bedrock]] causes its decomposition. The non-ice remnants form [[debris]] avalanches descending from the slopes of the crater walls.<ref name=Moore1999/> Such avalanches are often observed near and inside impact craters and termed "debris aprons".<ref name=Moore2004/><ref name="Greeley 2000"/><ref name=Moore1999/> Sometimes crater walls are cut by sinuous valley-like incisions called "gullies", which resemble certain [[Mars|Martian]] surface features.<ref name=Moore2004/> In the ice sublimation hypothesis, the low-lying dark material is interpreted as a blanket of primarily non-ice debris, which originated from the degraded rims of craters and has covered a predominantly icy bedrock.

==Origin and evolution==
The partial [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of Callisto (inferred e.g. from moment of inertia measurements) means that it has never been heated enough to melt its ice component.<ref name="Spohn 2003"/> Therefore, the most favorable model of its formation is a slow [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] in the low-density Jovian [[solar nebula|subnebula]]&mdash;a disk of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation.<ref name=Canup2002/> Such a prolonged accretion stage would allow cooling to largely keep up with the heat accumulation caused by impacts, radioactive decay and contraction, thereby preventing melting and fast differentiation.<ref name=Canup2002>{{cite journal|last=Canup|first=Robin M.|coauthors=Ward, William R.|title=Formation of the Galilean Satellites: Conditions of Accretion|year=2002|volume=124|pages=3404&ndash;3423|doi=10.1086/344684| url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~robin/cw02final.pdf|format=pdf | journal = The Astronomical Journal}}</ref> The allowable timescale of formation of Callisto lies then in the range 0.1&nbsp;million&ndash;10&nbsp;million years.<ref name=Canup2002/>

The further evolution of Callisto after [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] was determined by the balance of the [[radioactive]] heating, cooling through [[thermal conduction]] near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus [[convection]] in the interior.<ref name=Freeman2006>{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=J.|title=Non-Newtonian stagnant lid convection and the thermal evolution of Ganymede and Callisto|year=2006|volume=54|pages=2&ndash;14|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2005.10.003| url=http://bowfell.geol.ucl.ac.uk/~lidunka/EPSS-papers/pete2.pdf|format=pdf | journal = Planetary and Space Science}}</ref> Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all [[icy moon]]s. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the [[melting point]], due to the temperature dependence of ice [[viscosity]].<ref name=McKinnon2006/> Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1&nbsp;centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales.<ref name=McKinnon2006>{{cite journal|last=McKinnon|first=William B.|title=On convection in ice I shells of outer Solar System bodies, with detailed application to Callisto|year=2006|volume=183|pages=435&ndash;450|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.03.004| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006Icar..183..435M | journal = Icarus}}</ref> It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of the moon conducts heat without convection, while the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime.<ref name="Spohn 2003"/><ref name=McKinnon2006/> For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid [[lithosphere]] with a thickness of about 100&nbsp;km. Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the [[endogenic]] activity on the Callistoan surface.<ref name=McKinnon2006/><ref name=Nagel2004/> The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, [[ice|water ice]] exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the [[ice I]] on the surface to [[ice VII]] in the center.<ref name=Freeman2006/> The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] that would have otherwise formed a large rocky [[core (geology)|core]] and icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day.<ref name=Nagel2004>{{cite journal|last=Nagel|first=K.a|coauthors=Breuer, D.; Spohn, T.|title=A model for the interior structure, evolution, and differentiation of Callisto|year=2004|volume=169|pages=402&ndash;412|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.12.019| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..169..402N | journal = Icarus}}</ref>

The current understanding of the evolution of Callisto allows for the existence of a layer or "ocean" of liquid water in its interior. This is connected with the anomalous behavior of ice I phase's melting temperature, which decreases with [[pressure]], achieving temperatures as low as 251&nbsp;K at 2,070&nbsp;bar (207&nbsp;[[megapascal|MPa]]).<ref name="Spohn 2003"/> In all realistic models of Callisto the temperature in the layer between 100 and 200&nbsp;km in depth is very close to, or exceeds slightly, this anomalous melting temperature.<ref name=Freeman2006/><ref name=McKinnon2006/><ref name=Nagel2004/> The presence of even small amounts of [[ammonia]]&mdash;about 1&ndash;2% by weight&mdash;almost guarantees the liquid's existence because ammonia would lower the melting temperature even further.<ref name="Spohn 2003"/>

While Callisto is very similar in bulk properties to [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], it apparently had a much simpler [[geological history]]. The surface appears to have been shaped mainly by impacts and other [[exogenic]] forces.<ref name="Greeley 2000"/> Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity.<ref name=Showman1999/> Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions,<ref name = "Barr2">{{Cite journal

Proposed for a launch in 2020, the [[Europa Jupiter System Mission]] (EJSM) is a joint [[NASA]]/[[ESA]] proposal for exploration of [[Jupiter]]'s moons. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA/NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the [[Titan Saturn System Mission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7897585.stm|title=Jupiter in space agencies' sights|first=Paul|last=Rincon|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-02-20|date=2009-02-20}}</ref> ESA's contribution will still face funding competition from other ESA projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=41177|title=Cosmic Vision 2015&ndash;2025 Proposals|date=2007-07-21|publisher=ESA|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> EJSM consists of the NASA-led [[Jupiter Europa Orbiter]], the ESA-led [[Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter]], and possibly a [[JAXA]]-led [[Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter]].

In 2003 [[NASA]] conducted a conceptual study called [[Human Outer Planets Exploration]] (HOPE) regarding the future human exploration of the [[Solar System#Outer Solar System|outer solar system]]. The target chosen to consider in detail was Callisto.<ref name=HOPE>{{cite web|title=Revolutionary Concepts for Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE)|last=Trautman|first=Pat|coauthors=Bethke, Kristen|publisher=NASA|year=2003|url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/soffen/travelgrant/bethke.pdf|format=pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Troutman|first=Patrick A.|coauthors=Bethke, Kristen; Stillwagen, Fred; Caldwell, Darrell L. Jr.; Manvi, Ram; Strickland, Chris; Krizan, Shawn A.|title=Revolutionary Concepts for Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE)|journal=American Institute of Physics Conference Proceedings|date=28 January 2003|volume=654|pages=821<U+2013>828|accessdate=10 May 2006|doi=10.1063/1.1541373}}</ref>

It was proposed that it could be possible to build a surface base on Callisto that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.<ref name="CallistoBase">{{cite web|title=Vision for Space Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/55583main_vision_space_exploration2.pdf|publisher=[[NASA]]|year=2004|format=pdf}}</ref> Advantages of a base on this moon include the low radiation (due to Callisto's distance from Jupiter) and geological stability. It could facilitate remote exploration of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], or be an ideal location for a Jovian system waystation servicing spacecraft heading farther into the outer Solar System, using a [[gravity assist]] from a close flyby of Jupiter after departing Callisto.<ref name=HOPE/>

In a December 2003 report, NASA expressed belief that an attempt for a manned mission to Callisto may be possible in the 2040s.<ref>http://trajectory.grc.nasa.gov/aboutus/papers/STAIF-2003-177.pdf</ref>
