'''Wayne Douglas Gretzky''', [[Order of Canada|CC]] ({{IPA-en|<U+02C8><U+0261>r<U+025B>tski|pron}}; born January 26, 1961) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] player and former head coach. Nicknamed "The Great One", he is generally regarded as the best player in the history of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and has been called "the greatest hockey player ever"<ref name="Greatest"/> by many sportswriters, players, and the NHL itself. Upon his retirement on April 18, 1999, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six [[NHL All-Star Game|All-Star]] records. He is the only NHL player to total over 200&nbsp;points in one season &ndash; a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100&nbsp;points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. Gretzky's [[jersey number]], 99, has been [[List of NHL retired numbers|retired]] by all teams in the National Hockey League. He was voted one of six players to the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]]'s (IIHF) [[IIHF Centennial All-Star Team|Centennial All-Star Team]] in a poll conducted by a group of 56 experts from 16 countries.<ref name="Greatest">For his titles, see {{cite web|url=http://www.ualbertacentennial.ca/achievements/degrees/2000.html |title=University of Alberta: Honorary Degree Recipients (2000-2007) |publisher=Ualbertacentennial.ca |year=2000 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}

Born and raised in [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]], Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played [[List of ice hockey leagues#Amateur|minor hockey]] at a level far above his peers.<ref name="Young">{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014218.html|title='Great' and 'Gretzky' belong together|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2006-10-04}}</ref> Despite his unimpressive stature, strength and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. Gretzky also became known for setting up behind the net, an area that was [[nickname]]d "Gretzky's office" because of his skills there.<ref name="sptimes.com">{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/03/hockeyschool/graphic.shtml|title=Gretzky's office|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref>

In 1978, he signed with the [[Indianapolis Racers]] of the World Hockey Association (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four [[Stanley Cup]] championships. His trade to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the team's performance, eventually leading them to the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]], and is credited with popularizing hockey in California.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allen |first=Kevin |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2008-08-07-gretzky-trade-anniversary_N.htm |title=Gretzky trade remembered for 'seismic impact' |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref> Gretzky played briefly for the [[St. Louis Blues]] and finished his career with the [[New York Rangers]]. In his career, Gretzky captured nine [[Hart Trophy|Hart Trophies]] as the most valuable player, ten [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross Trophies]] for most [[point (ice hockey)|points]] in a season, five [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy|Lady Byng Trophies]] for sportsmanship and performance, five [[Lester B. Pearson Award]]s, and two [[Conn Smythe Trophy|Conn Smythe Trophies]] as playoff MVP.

After his retirement in [[1998<U+2013>99 NHL season|1999]], he was immediately inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], and is the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. He became Executive Director for the [[Canadian national men's hockey team]] during the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], in which the team won a gold medal. In [[1999<U+2013>2000 NHL season|2000]] he became part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, and following the [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout]] he became the team's head coach.

== Early years ==
Prior to [[World War I]], Gretzky's paternal grandfather Anton (Tony) Gretzky immigrated along with his family to [[Canada]] via the [[United States]] from the [[Russian Empire]] (what is now [[Grodno|Grodno, Belarus]]).{{sfn|Kukushkin|2007|p=132}} Following the war, Anton would marry his wife, Mary, who immigrated from [[Pidhaitsi]], [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] (now [[Ukraine]]).{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=11}} Tony and Mary owned a {{convert|25|acre|ha|sing=on}} [[cucumber]] farm in Canning, Ontario{{sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=13}} where [[Walter Gretzky]] was born and raised and where he met Wayne's mother, Phyllis Hockin.{{sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=31}} They married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in [[Brantford, Ontario]],  where Walter worked for [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Canada]].{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=11}}. The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because it was flat enough to make an ice rink on every winter.{{sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=33}} Wayne was joined by a sister, Kim (b. 1963), and brothers [[Keith Gretzky|Keith]], Glen and [[Brent Gretzky|Brent]]. The family would regularly visit Tony and Mary's farm and watch ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' together. By age two, Wayne was trying to score [[goal (ice hockey)|goals]] against Mary using a souvenir stick.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=12}} The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=12}}

Gretzky's ancestry is typically described as English on his mother's side and Belarusian or Polish on his father's side, but there is also evidence of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] ancestry on his father's side.{{sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148}} In interviews, Gretzky's father Walter has stated that his parents were [[Belarusians]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Terry|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Phoenix/2008/02/13/4843850-sun.html|title=Family comes first|work=[[Ottawa Sun]]|date=2008-02-13|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> while on other occasions he has mentioned his family's [[Poles|Polish]] ancestry.{{sfn|McKenzie|1999|p=43}} Anton Gretzky has been described as having "been born in Russia with [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] forebears" and "the only Slavic language spoken in the Gretzky family [was] [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]".{{sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148}} Gretzky's mother Phyllis is of English descent{{sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148}} and she is related to [[United Kingdom|British]] General [[Isaac Brock|Sir Isaac Brock]], a hero of the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn |Gretzky |2001 |p=31}}

Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the back yard of the family home, nicknamed the "Wally Coliseum".{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|pp=19<U+2013>20}} Drills included skating around Javex bleach bottles and tin cans, and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able to pick up the puck again in full flight.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} Additionally, Walter gave the advice to "skate where the puck's going, not where it's been".{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} Wayne was a classic [[child prodigy|prodigy]] whose extraordinary skills made him the target of jealous parents.<ref name="CBCten">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/gretzky-wayne.html|title=Top Ten Greatest Canadians&nbsp;<U+2013> Wayne Gretzky|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2007-02-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061118073910/http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/gretzky-wayne.html| archivedate = November 18, 2006}}</ref>

Gretzky's first team, at age six, was a team of ten-year-olds, starting a pattern where Gretzky always played at a level far above his peers through his minor hockey years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Saraceno|first=Jon|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/gretzky/hall04.htm|title=Gretzky nurtured for hockey fame|work=USA Today|date=1999-11-22|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref> His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked that he handled the puck better than the ten-year-olds.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=15}} According to Martin, "Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player, and he'd get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing."{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=17}} The sweaters for ten-year-olds were far too large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the right side. He continued doing this throughout his NHL career.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=18<U+2013>19}}

By the age of ten he had scored 378&nbsp;goals and 139&nbsp;[[assist (ice hockey)|assists]] in just one&nbsp;season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers.<ref name="greatness">{{cite book|last=Falla|first=Jack|editor=Dan Diamond|chapterurl=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=381966|chapter=Wayne Gretzky: Greatness Ascendant|title=Total Hockey: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Hockey League|publisher=Total Sports|accessdate=2010-09-09|isbn=978-1-892129-85-7|year=2000}}</ref> His play now attracted media attention beyond his hometown of Brantford, including a profile by John Iaboni in the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in October 1971.<ref>{{cite news|last=Iaboni|first=John|url=http://www.canoe.ca/GretzkyHall/nov22_hkygen.html|title=No. 9 with big No. 9 aspirations|work=[[Toronto Telegram]]|date=1971-10-28|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> By age 13, he had scored over 1,000&nbsp;goals.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=16}} His play attracted considerable negative attention from other players' parents, including those of his teammates, and he was often booed.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=15}} According to Walter, the "capper" was being booed on "Brantford Day" at Toronto's [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in February 1975.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=16}}

When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in [[Toronto]], partly to further his career, and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure he faced in his hometown. The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win Wayne the right to play elsewhere, which was disallowed at the time.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|pp=16<U+2013>18}} The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the [[Toronto Nationals (1970<U+2013>1980)|Toronto Nationals]]. He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the [[Metro Junior A Hockey League|Metro Junior B Hockey League]] in 1975<U+2013>76, with 60&nbsp;points in 28&nbsp;games. The following year, as a 15-year-old, he had 72&nbsp;points in 32&nbsp;games with the same team, then known as the Seneca Nationals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199901&type=Player&page=statsawards&list=ByName|title=Wayne Gretzky Career Statistics|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref> That year, he also played three games with the Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey Association as an emergency call-up, and even then ''the Great One'' impressed scouts with his abilities despite his small stature and youth.  In addition, he signed with his first agent, Bob Behnke.

Despite his offensive statistics, two teams bypassed him in the 1977 [[Ontario Hockey League|OMJHL]] Midget Draft of 16-year-olds. The [[Oshawa Generals]] picked [[Tom McCarthy (ice hockey b. 1960)|Tom McCarthy]], and the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]] picked [[Steve Peters (ice hockey)|Steve Peters]] second overall. With the third pick, the [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] selected Gretzky, even though Walter Gretzky had told the team that Wayne would not move to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], a [[northern Ontario]] city that inflicts a heavy traveling schedule on its junior team. The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local family they knew and Wayne played a season in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] at the age of 16 with the Greyhounds.<ref name="Orr">{{cite news|last=Orr|first=Frank|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/gretzky/greatone.html|title=Gretzky, only 16, carries a 'Gold-Orr' label|work=[[The Sporting News]]|date=1978-01-27|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref> It was with the Greyhounds that Wayne first wore the number&nbsp;99 on his jersey. He originally wanted to wear number&nbsp;9<U+2014>for his hockey hero [[Gordie Howe]]<U+2014>but it was already being worn by teammate Brian Gualazzi. At coach [[Murray MacPherson|Muzz MacPherson]]'s suggestion, Gretzky settled on 99.<ref name="99reasons">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=384579|title=99 Reasons Why Wayne Gretzky is "The Great One"|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=2008-11-28}}</ref>

At 16, in his single year at the major junior level, Gretzky surpassed the OMJHL single-season scoring record, winning the OMJHL [[Emms Family Award|Rookie of the Year]] and [[William Hanley Trophy|Most Sportsmanlike]] awards.

== World Hockey Association ==
In 1978, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) league was in competition with the established NHL. The NHL did not allow the signing of players under the age of 20, but the WHA had no rules regarding such signings. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the [[Indianapolis Racers]] and the [[Birmingham Bulls]]. Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett wanted to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect,{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=221}} but it was Racers owner [[Nelson Skalbania]] who signed 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth $1.75&nbsp;million US.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> Gretzky scored his first professional goal against [[Dave Dryden]] of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=219}} in his fifth game, and his second goal four seconds later.{{sfn|Davis|1999|p=51}} Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because he knew a [[NHL<U+2013>WHA merger|deal]] to take some WHA teams into the NHL was in the works. He also knew that the Racers could not hope to be included among those teams, and hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling the young star.{{sfn|Hunter|1997|p=192}}

Gretzky only played eight games for Indianapolis. The Racers were losing $40,000 per game. Skalbania told Gretzky he would be moved, offering him a choice between Edmonton and Winnipeg. On the advice of his agent, Gretzky picked Edmonton, but the move was not that simple. Gretzky, [[goaltender]] [[Eddie Mio]] and forward [[Peter Driscoll]] were put on a private plane, not knowing where they would land and what team they would be joining. While in the air, Skalbania worked on the deal. Skalbania offered to play a game of [[backgammon]] with Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty, the stakes being if Gobuty won, he would get Gretzky and if he lost, he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets. Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in Edmonton.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=34<U+2013>35}} Skalbania sold Gretzky, Mio and Driscoll to his former partner, and then-owner of the Edmonton Oilers, [[Peter Pocklington]]. Although the announced price was $850,000, Pocklington actually paid $700,000.{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=219}} Mio paid the $4,000 bill for the flight with his credit card.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=35}} The money was not enough to keep the Racers alive; they folded that December.{{sfn|Hunter|1997|p=192}}

One of the highlights of Gretzky's season was his appearance in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars against [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. The WHA All-Stars were coached by [[Jacques Demers]], who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie Howe and his son, [[Mark Howe]].{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=234}} In game one, the line scored seven points, and the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4<U+2013>2.{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=234}} In game two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4<U+2013>2.{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=234}} The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA won by a score of 4<U+2013>3.{{sfn|Surgent|2004|p=289}}

On Gretzky's 18th birthday, January 26, 1979, Pocklington signed him to a 10-year personal services contract (the longest in hockey history at the time) worth [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3&nbsp;million, with options for 10 more years.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]

In his first NHL season, [[1979<U+2013>80 NHL season|1979<U+2013>80]], Gretzky proved his critics wrong. He was awarded the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as the League's [[Most Valuable Player]] (the first of eight in a row) and tied for the scoring lead with [[Marcel Dionne]] with 137&nbsp;points.<ref name="Hart">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinners.jsp?tro=HMT|title=Hart Memorial Trophy Winners|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=2008-04-10|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429223641/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinners.jsp?tro=HMT |archivedate = April 29, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Jim|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/gretzky/bargain.html|title=Gretzky is a bargain|work=The Sporting News|date=1980-11-01|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref> Although Gretzky played 79&nbsp;games to Dionne's 80, Dionne was awarded the [[Art Ross Trophy]] since he scored more goals (53 vs. 51).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsofHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=ART&year=1979=80|title=1979-80 Art Ross Trophy Winner|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref> The season still stands as the highest point total by a first year player in NHL history.

In his second season, Gretzky won the Art Ross (the first of seven consecutive) with a then-record 164&nbsp;points, breaking both [[Bobby Orr]]'s record for assists in a season (102) and [[Phil Esposito]]'s record for points in a season (152).<ref name="99reasons"/> He won his second straight Hart Trophy.<ref name="Hart"/> In the first game of the 1981 playoffs versus the Montreal Canadiens, Gretzky had five assists.

=== "The Trade" ===
Two hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=177<U+2013>179}} Walter had known for months, but kept it from Gretzky so as to not upset him. According to Walter, Gretzky was being "shopped" to Los Angeles, Detroit, New York and Vancouver. According to Gretzky, Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well (a similar reason to the cause of [[Babe Ruth]] being sold to the [[New York Yankees]]), and had gone "sour" on Gretzky and wanted to move him.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=182<U+2013>183}} At first, Gretzky did not want to leave Edmonton, but he later received a call from [[Los Angeles Kings]] owner [[Bruce McNall]] while on his honeymoon asking permission to meet and discuss the deal. Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that [[Marty McSorley]] and [[Mike Krushelnyski]] join him as teammates in Los Angeles. After the details of the trade were finalized by McNall and Pocklington, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=183}} When Pocklington revealed his plans to trade Gretzky to Oilers general manager and head coach [[Glen Sather]], Sather went to work trying to stop the trade, but, when he found out Gretzky played a part in it, he changed his attitude to GM as he requested [[Luc Robitaille]] in exchange. The Kings refused, instead offering [[Jimmy Carson]].<ref>{{cite web

On August 9, 1988, in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL, the Oilers traded Gretzky, along with McSorley and Krushelnyski, to the Kings for Carson, [[Martin Gelinas]], $15&nbsp;million in cash, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in [[1989 NHL Entry Draft|1989]] (later traded to the [[New Jersey Devils]] &ndash; New Jersey selected [[Jason Miller (ice hockey)|Jason Miller]]), [[1991 NHL Entry Draft|1991]] ([[Martin Ru<U+010D><U+00ED>nsk<U+00FD>|Martin Rucinsky]]), and [[1993 NHL Entry Draft|1993]] ([[Nick Stajduhar]]).<ref name="NHLnotes"/> "The Trade", as it came to be known,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/transformation_transformed_after_trade.html|title=After the Trade|publisher=OilersHeritage.com|accessdate=2006-07-13}}</ref> upset Canadians to the extent that [[New Democratic Party]] [[House Leader]] [[Nelson Riis]] demanded that the government block it,<ref>{{cite web|title=20 Years Ago: Gretzky Deal Shocked the Hockey World|publisher=The Sports Network|date=2008-08-09|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=245714|accessdate=2011-02-10}}</ref> and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside the [[Rexall Place|Northlands Coliseum]].<ref name="CBCten"/> Gretzky himself was considered a "traitor" by some Canadians for turning his back on his adopted hometown, and his home country; his motivation was widely rumoured to be the furtherance of [[Janet Jones|his wife]]'s acting career.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Terry|title=Telling it like it is|work=[[Edmonton Sun]]|date=August 12, 1988}}</ref>

Edmontonians bore no grudge against Gretzky. On his first appearance in Edmonton after the trade<U+2014>a game that was nationally televised in Canada<U+2014>he received a four-minute standing ovation.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} The arena was sold out, and the attendance of 17,503 was the Oilers' biggest crowd ever to that date.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} Large cheers erupted for his first shift, his first touch of the puck, his two assists, and for [[Mark Messier]]'s body check of Gretzky into the boards.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} After the game, Gretzky took the opportunity to confirm his patriotism: "I'm still proud to be a Canadian. I didn't desert my country. I moved because I was traded and that's where my job is. But I'm Canadian to the core. I hope Canadians understand that."{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} After the 1988<U+2013>89 season, a life-sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected outside the Northlands Coliseum, holding the Stanley Cup over his head (picture shown above, to the right).{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=67}}

=== Los Angeles Kings (1988<U+2013>1996) ===
The Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain. He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular-season game.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=202}} The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight on their way to qualifying for the playoffs. Despite being [[Underdog (competition)|underdogs]] against the defending Stanley Cup Champion Oilers in the [[Smythe Division]] semifinals, Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad, spearheading the Kings' return from a 3<U+2013>1 series deficit to win the series 4<U+2013>3.

The next season, Gretzky broke [[Gordie Howe]]'s career goal-scoring record and won the scoring title,<ref name="99reasons"/> but the team began a long slide, and despite numerous player and coaching moves, they failed to qualify for the playoffs again until [[1997<U+2013>98 NHL season|1998]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kings.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=4183|title=The History of the Los Angeles Kings|publisher=[[Los Angeles Kings]]|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref> Long before then, running out of time and looking for a team with which he could win again, Gretzky had been traded from the Kings at his request.

During the [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL lockout]], Gretzky and some friends (including [[Mark Messier]], [[Marty McSorley]], [[Brett Hull]], and [[Steve Yzerman]]) formed the [[Ninety Nine All Stars Tour]] and played some exhibition games in various countries.

The [[1998<U+2013>99 NHL season|1998<U+2013>99]] season was his last season. He reached one milestone in this last season, breaking the professional total (regular season and playoffs) goal-scoring record of 1,071, which had been held by Gordie Howe.

Gretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canadian national junior team]] at the [[1978 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1978 World Junior Championships]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. He was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16. He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and [[List of IIHF World Under 20 Championship Directorate award winners|Best Forward]] honours. Canada finished with the bronze medal.<ref name=intl>{{cite web

Gretzky debuted with the [[Canada national men's ice hockey team|Team Canada's men's team]] at the [[1981 Canada Cup]].  He led the tournament in scoring with 12 points en route to a second-place finish to the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]],<ref name=intl/> losing 8<U+2013>1 in the final.  Seven months later, Gretzky joined Team Canada for the [[1982 World Ice Hockey Championships|1982 World Championships]] in [[Finland]].  He notched 14 points in 10 games, including a two-goal, two-assist effort in Canada's final game against [[Sweden national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] to earn the bronze.<ref name=intl/>  Gretzky did not win his first international competition until the [[1984 Canada Cup]], when Canada defeated Sweden in a best-of-three finals.  He led the tournament in scoring for the second consecutive time and was named to the All-Star Team.<ref name=intl/>

Gretzky's international career highlight arguably came three years later at the [[1987 Canada Cup]]. Gretzky has called the tournament the best hockey he had played in his life.{{sfn|Willes|2007}}  Playing on a line with [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] superstar [[Mario Lemieux]], he recorded a tournament-best 21 points in nine games.  After losing the first game of a best-of-three final series against the Soviets, Gretzky propelled Canada with a five-assist performance, including the game-winning pass to Lemieux in overtime to extend the tournament.{{sfn|Willes|2007}}  In the deciding game three, Gretzky and Lemieux once again combined for the game-winner.  With the score tied 5<U+2013>5 and 1:26 minutes to go in regulation, Lemieux one-timed a pass from Gretzky on a 3<U+2013>on<U+2013>1 with defenceman [[Larry Murphy (ice hockey)|Larry Murphy]].  Lemieux scored to win the tournament for Canada; the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Canadian international competition.{{sfn|Willes|2007}}

The [[1991 Canada Cup]] marked the last time the tournament was played under the "Canada Cup" moniker.  Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with 12 points in seven games.  He did not, however, compete in the final against the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|United States]] due to a back injury.<ref name=intl/>  Canada nevertheless won in two games by scores of 4<U+2013>1 and 4<U+2013>2.  Five years later, the tournament was revived and renamed the [[World Cup of Hockey|World Cup]] in [[1996 World Cup of Hockey|1996]].  It marked the first time Gretzky did not finish as the tournament's leading scorer with seven points in eight games for fourth overall.<ref name=intl/>  The 1996 World Cup also ended Canada's winning streak at the tournament (including the Canada Cups), losing in three games of a best-of-three final.

Leading up to the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano]], [[Japan]], it was announced that NHL players would be eligible to play for the first time.  Gretzky was named to the club on November 29, 1997.<ref name=intl/>  However, Gretzky, was passed over for the captaincy, along with several other Canadian veterans including [[Steve Yzerman]] and [[Ray Bourque]] in favour of the younger [[Eric Lindros]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lapointe|first=Joe|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E2D6153AF932A35751C0A96E958260|title=Nagano '98; Wearing C, for Canada|work=The New York Times

== Influences and skills ==
Gretzky's basic athletic abilities were not considered impressive. He was {{Convert|6|ft|m}} tall, weighing only {{convert|160|lb}} as an 18-year-old NHL rookie in 1979, and {{convert|185|lb}} at the end of his career in 1999. At the beginning of Gretzky's NHL career, many critics opined that Gretzky was "too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the NHL".<ref>

Hall of Fame defenceman Bobby Orr said of Gretzky, "He passes better than anybody I've ever seen. And he thinks so far ahead."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Swift|first=E. M.|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126259/index.htm

Much has been written about Gretzky<U+2019>s highly-developed hockey instincts, but he once explained that what appeared to be instinct was in large part the effect of his relentless study of the game and a resulting deep understanding of its shifting patterns and dynamics. Veteran hockey journalist Peter Gzowski says that elite athletes in all sports understand the game so well, and in such detail, that they can instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns of play. Analyzing Gretzky<U+2019>s hockey skills, he says, <U+201C>What we take to be creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored in his brain as deeply and firmly as his own phone number." Gzowski presented this theory to Gretzky, and he fully agreed. <U+201C>Absolutely,<U+201D> Gretzky said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s a hundred percent right. It<U+2019>s all practice. I got it from my dad. Nine out of ten people think it<U+2019>s instinct, and it isn<U+2019>t. Nobody would ever say a doctor had learned his profession by instinct; yet in my own way I<U+2019>ve put in almost as much time studying hockey as a medical student puts in studying medicine.<U+201D><ref> {{Cite book

Gzowski says that Gretzky seemed to be able to, in effect, slow down time. <U+201C>There is an unhurried grace to everything Gretzky does on the ice. Winding up for the slapshot, he will stop for an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc, like a golfer with a rhythmic swing.<U+201D>

Gretzky's skills were developed on a backyard rink at his home, with extraordinary dedication and the encouragement and teachings of his father Walter. Walter Gretzky had played Junior B hockey, but was slowed by [[chicken pox]] and failed in a tryout for the Junior A Toronto Marlboros, ending his playing career.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=20}} Walter cultivated a love of hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to enhance their skills.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} <!-- Asked about Wayne's development, Walter and replied, "Wayne always did like hockey. Even when he was three years old<U+2014>and it just kind of happened."{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=18}} Wayne was asked about how it happened. Where it happened was "right in my own backyard."{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} --> On the backyard rink, nicknamed the "Wally Coliseum", winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well as teammate. According to Brent Gretzky, "It was definitely pressed on us, but we loved the game. Without the direction of the father, I don't know where I'd be."{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=22}}

The rink itself was built so that Walter could keep an eye on his boys from the warmth of his kitchen, instead of watching them outdoors on a neighbourhood rink, as Wayne put in long hours on skates.{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=19}} Walter's drills were his own invention, but were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing to offer him: "I'd been doing these drills since I was three. My dad was very smart."{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=2}}

Where Gretzky differed from others in his development was in the extraordinary commitment of time on the ice. In his autobiography, he wrote:

: All I wanted to do in the winters was be on the ice. I'd get up in the morning, skate from 7:00 to 8:30, go to school, come home at 3:30, stay on the ice until my mom insisted I come in for dinner, eat in my skates, then go back out until 9:00. On Saturdays and Sundays we'd have huge games, but nighttime became my time. It was a sort of unwritten rule around the neighbourhood that I was to be out there myself or with my dad.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|pp=12<U+2013>13}}

Gretzky would prod next-door neighbour Brian Rizzetto to play goal after sundown to practice his backhand.{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=2}}

Gretzky also excelled at [[baseball]] and [[box lacrosse]], which he played during the summer. At age ten, after scoring 196 goals in his hockey league, he scored 158 goals in lacrosse.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=14}} According to Gretzky, lacrosse was where he learned to protect himself from hard [[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]: "In those days you could be hit from behind in lacrosse, as well as cross-checked, so you had to learn how to roll body checks for self-protection."{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=27}} Wayne, who weighed far less than the NHL average, adroitly applied this technique as a professional player, avoiding checks with such skill that a rumour circulated that there was an unwritten rule not to hit Gretzky.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=95}} But Wayne himself dispelled this rumor at the end of one grueling season with the Edmonton Oilers, in which he had suffered a mild concussion as a result of what writer Michael Benson called a "cheap shot" from [[Winnipeg Jets (1972<U+2013>96)|Winnipeg Jets]] player [[Dale Hawerchuk]]. "People say there is an unwritten rule that you can<U+2019>t hit Gretzky," Wayne said, <U+201C>but that is not true."{{sfn |Benson |2004| pp=54<U+2013>55}} Fellow hockey Hall-of-Famer [[Denis Potvin]] compared attempting to hit Gretzky to <U+201C>wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill. He had the strongest danger radar of anyone on the ice.<U+201D> Gordie Howe once said that parting Gretzky's hair would reveal a third eye.<ref>{{Cite news

Gretzky became known for setting up behind the net, an area that was nicknamed "Gretzky's office" because of his skills there.<ref name="sptimes.com"/> He could pass to teammates like [[Luc Robitaille]] and [[Jari Kurri]], or jump out quickly for a wrap-around shot.

On May 5, 2009, the Coyotes' holding company, Dewey Ranch Hockey LLC, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]].  An ownership dispute involving [[Research in Motion]]'s [[Jim Balsillie]] (with the intention of relocating the team) and the NHL itself arose, which eventually ended up in Court.  Gretzky did not attend the Coyotes' training camp, leaving associate head coach [[Ulf Samuelsson]] in charge, due to an uncertain contractual status with the club, whose bankruptcy hearings were continuing. Bidders for the club had indicated that Gretzky would no longer be associated with the team after it emerged from bankruptcy, and on September 24, 2009, Gretzky stepped down as head coach and head of hockey operations of the Coyotes.<ref>{{cite web

=== Winter Olympics ===
Gretzky was Executive Director of the Canadian men's hockey team at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. On February 18, he lashed out at the media at a [[News conference|press conference]], frustrated with media and fan comments regarding his team's uninspiring 1<U+2013>1<U+2013>1 start.<ref name="record-lash-report">{{cite news|title=It's us against the world, emotional Gretzky says; The Great One even lashes out against 'American propaganda'|work=The Record|page=D1|date=2002-02-19}}</ref> His temper boiled over after Canada's 3<U+2013>3&nbsp;draw versus the Czech Republic, as he launched a tirade against the perceived negative reputation of Team Canada amongst other national squads, and called rumours of dissent in the dressing room the result of "American propaganda". "They're loving us not doing well", he said, referring to American hockey fans.<ref name="record-lash-report"/> American fans online began calling Gretzky a "crybaby"; defenders said he was merely borrowing a page from former coach [[Glen Sather]] to take the pressure off his players. Gretzky addressed those comments by saying he spoke out to protect the Canadian players, and the tirade was not "staged".<ref>{{cite news|last=Scanlan|first=Wayne|date=2002-02-20|title=Gretzky: No regrets: The Canadian hockey team boss says he spoke out, loudly, to 'protect' his players|work=The Ottawa Citizen|page=C1}}</ref> The Canadian team won the gold medal, its first in 50&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/24/usa_canada_ap|title=Stand on guard for thee|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=2002-02-25|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

Gretzky again acted as Executive Director of Canada's men's hockey team at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin, Italy]], though not with the success of 2002; the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|failed to win a medal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torino.olympics.com.au/news.cfm?ArticleID=6443|title=Gretzky moved to tears as Russia beats Canada 2-0|publisher=[[Australian Olympic Committee]]|date=2006-02-23|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> He was asked to manage Canada's team at the 2005 [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], but declined due to his mother's poor health.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/story/?id=119130|title=Statement from Wayne Gretzky|publisher=The Sports Network|date=2005-03-21|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

Gretzky also served as an ambassador and contributor in Vancouver winning the [[Bids for the 2010 Winter Olympics|bidding process]] to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. He went to [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] and was part of the presentation team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0307/02/lol.05.html|title=Transcripts-Vancouver Ecstatic Over Winning Olympic Bid|publisher=CNN|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

Gretzky was the final Olympic torchbearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. He was one of four who lit the cauldron at [[BC Place Stadium]] during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] (although one was unable to due to technical difficulties with one of the cauldron's "arms" which failed to raise) and then jogged out of the stadium, where he was then driven by police escorts through the streets of downtown Vancouver to light a second, outdoor cauldron near the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]] located in the city's downtown waterfront district.<ref>{{cite video|title=2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|medium=television|publisher=NBC Sports|date=2010-02-12}}</ref>  Under [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Although another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city, this was not possible since the ceremony took place indoors. However, [[VANOC]] secretly built a second outdoor cauldron next to the West Building of the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]], and Gretzky was secretly chosen to light this permanent cauldron.<ref>{{cite news

=== Business ventures ===
Gretzky has owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes. In 1985, Gretzky bought the [[Gatineau Olympiques|Hull Olympiques]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] for $175,000&nbsp;CA.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Montreal Gazette |date=March 8, 1985 |title=Gretzky buys Hull juniors|page = C9}}</ref> During his ownership, the team's colors were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colors when he played for the Los Angeles Kings.

In 1991, Gretzky purchased the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] with [[Bruce McNall]] and [[John Candy]]. The club won the [[Grey Cup]] championship in the first year of the partnership but struggled in the two following seasons, and the partnership sold the team before the 1994 season. Only McNall's name was engraved on the Grey Cup as team owner, but in November 2007, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] corrected the oversight, adding Gretzky's and Candy's names.<ref>{{cite news
