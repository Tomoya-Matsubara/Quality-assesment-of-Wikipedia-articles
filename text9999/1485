The '''Common Raven''' (''Corvus corax)'', also known as the '''Northern Raven''', is a large all-black [[passerine]] [[bird]] in the [[Corvidae|crow family]]. Found across the [[northern hemisphere]], it is the most widely distributed of all [[Corvidae|corvid]]s. There are eight known [[subspecies]] with little variation in appearance, however recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences between populations from different regions.

It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the [[Thick-billed Raven]], and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the Common Raven is between 56 and 69&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (22 to 27&nbsp;[[inch]]es) in length, with recorded weights ranging from 0.69 to 1.63&nbsp;kg (1.5 to 3.6&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|pounds]]). Common Ravens typically live about 10 to 15 years in the wild, although lifespans of up to 40 years have been recorded. Young birds may travel in flocks, but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory.

The Common Raven has coexisted with humans for thousands of years, and in some areas has been so successful that it is considered a pest. Part of its success comes from its [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet; Common Ravens are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on [[carrion]], insects and food waste, in addition to cereal grains, berries, fruit and small animals. 

Some remarkable feats of problem-solving have been observed in the species, leading to the belief that it is highly [[intelligence|intelligent]]. Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art and literature. In many indigenous cultures, including those of [[Norse mythology|Scandinavia]], ancient [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]], [[Bhutan]] and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|northwest coast of North America]], the Common Raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or god.<ref name="Jones">{{cite book | last =Jones | first =Noragh | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Power of Raven, Wisdom of Serpent | publisher =Floris Books | date =1995 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-9402-6266-5 }}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
The Common Raven was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', and it still bears its original name of ''Corvus corax''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book  | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus  | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The word "raven" is similar in many old [[Germanic languages]]; the [[Old English language|Old English]] word for a raven was ''hr<U+00E6>fn''; in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] it was ''hrafn'' and [[Old High German]] ''(h)raban'',<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| title=Raven|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editor=J.

===Classification===
The closest relatives of the Common Raven are the [[Brown-necked Raven]] ''(C. ruficollis)'' and the [[Pied Crow]] ''(C. albus)'' of [[Africa]], and the [[Chihuahuan Raven]] ''(C. cryptoleucus)'' of the [[North America]]n southwest.<ref>Goodwin. p70-72</ref> There are eight recognized [[subspecies]]:
 
* '''''C. c. corax''''' (the nominate subspecies) occurs from [[Europe]] eastwards to [[Lake Baikal]], south to the [[Caucasus]] region and northern [[Iran]]. It has a relatively short, arched bill.
* '''''C. c. varius''''' occurs in [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. It is less glossy than ''C. c. principalis'' or nominate ''corax'', is intermediate in size, and the bases of its neck feathers are whitish.
[[Image:Krummi 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Common Raven, ''C. c. varius'', in flight over [[Seltjarnarnes]], [[Iceland]]]]
* '''''C. c. subcorax''''' occurs from [[Greece]] eastwards to north-west [[India]], [[Central Asia]] and western [[China]] though not the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region. It is larger than the nominate form, but has relatively short throat feathers (''hackles''). Its plumage is generally all black, though its neck and breast have a brownish tone similar to that of the Brown-necked Raven; this more evident when the plumage is worn. The bases of its neck feathers, though somewhat variable in colour, are often almost whitish.
* '''''C. c. tingitanus''''' occurs in [[North Africa]] and the [[Canary island]]s. It is the smallest subspecies, with the shortest throat hackles and a distinctly oily plumage gloss. Its bill is short but markedly stout, and the [[culmen]] is strongly arched. When worn, its plumage fades to dark brown on the head and body. 
* '''''C. c. tibetanus''''' occurs in the Himalayas. It is the largest and glossiest subspecies, with the longest throat hackles. Its bill is large but less imposing than that of ''C. c. principalis'', and the bases of its neck feathers are grey.
* '''''C. c. kamtschaticus''''' occurs in north-eastern Asia, intergrading into the nominate subspecies in the [[Lake Baikal|Baikal]] region. It is intermediate in size between ''C. c. principalis'' and ''C. c. corax'' and has a distinctly larger and thicker bill than does the nominate race.
* '''''C. c. principalis''''' occurs in northern [[North America]] and [[Greenland]]. It has a large body and the largest bill, its plumage is strongly glossed, and its throat hackles are well developed.
* '''''C. c. sinuatus''''' occurs in south-central [[USA]] and [[Central America]]. It is smaller, with a smaller and narrower bill than ''C. c. principalis''.

===Evolutionary history===
The Common Raven evolved in the [[Old World]] and crossed the [[Bering land bridge]] into North America.<ref>Marzluff and Angell p86</ref> Recent genetic studies, which examined the [[DNA]] of Common Ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two [[clade]]s: a [[California]] clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a [[Holarctic]] clade, found across the rest of the Northern hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.<ref name=USGS/> 

The findings indicate that Common Ravens from the rest of the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than they are to those in the California clade, and that Common Ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the [[Chihuahuan Raven]] ''(C. cryptoleucus)'' than they are to those in the Holarctic clade.<ref name=USGS>{{cite web|url=http://www.werc.usgs.gov/news/2000-12-19.html|title=California Ravens Are a Breed Apart|accessdate=2007-05-11|author=U.S. Geological Survey}}</ref>   Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the [[Pied Crow]] ''(C. albus)'' than they are to the California clade.<ref name="Feld05">{{cite journal| last=Feldman| first=Christopher R.| coauthor=Kevin E.

One explanation for these surprising genetic findings is that Common Ravens settled in California at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an [[ice age]]. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan Raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps at the same time as humans.<ref>Marzluff and Angell p86-87</ref>

A recent study of raven [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that members of the ''C. c. tingitanus''   subspecies have significant genetic differences from the rest of the Holarctic clade. This subspecies occurs only in North Africa and the Canary islands. The study also demonstrated that ''C. c. tingitanus'' ravens do not interbreed with other subspecies.<ref name="Bakom06">{{cite journal| last=Baker| first=Jason M.| coauthor=Kevin E.

== Description ==
A mature Common Raven is between 56 and 69&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (22 to 27&nbsp;[[inch]]es) in length, with a [[wing]]span of 115 to 130 cm (45 to 51 in).

Birds from colder regions such as the Himalayas and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills.<ref>Goodwin. p138-139</ref> The [[beak|bill]] is large and slightly curved. It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, mostly black [[iridescent]] plumage, and a dark brown [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. Juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue-grey iris.<ref>Goodwin. p138</ref> 

Apart from its greater size, the Common Raven differs from its cousins, the [[crow]]s, by having a larger and heavier beak, a shaggy throat, and a wedge-shaped tail.<ref name="observerbook"/> The species has a distinctive, deep, hollow ''pruk-pruk-pruk'' call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking ''toc-toc-toc'', a dry, grating ''kraa'', a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.<ref name ="Gwinner64">{{de icon}} {{cite journal|last=Gwinner| first=E.| year=1964| title=Untersuchungen <U+00FC>ber das ausdrucks und Sozialverhalten des Kolkraben (''Corvus corax'' L.)| journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Tierpsychologie| volume=21| issue=6| pages=657-748}}</ref>

Common Ravens can be very [[longevity|long-lived]], especially in captive or protected conditions; individuals at the [[Tower of London]] have lived for more than 40 years.<ref name="Boarman_Heinrich"/> Lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter: typically only 10 to 15 years.

Most Common Ravens prefer wooded areas, with large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In some areas of dense human population, such as [[California]] in the [[United States]], they take advantage of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers.<ref name=mojave/>

== Behavior ==
Common Ravens usually travel in mated pairs, although young birds may form [[flock]]s. Relationships between Common Ravens are often quarrelsome, however they demonstrate considerable devotion to their  families.<ref name=Oregon/>

=== Diet ===
[[Image:Common raves landfill.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A flock of Common Ravens feeding at a garbage dump]]
Common Ravens are [[omnivorous]] and highly opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and [[serendipity]].<ref name="Nogales">{{cite journal |last=Nogales |first=Manuel |coauthors=Elizabeth C.

One behaviour used by young birds is recruitment, where dominant juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells.  In ''Ravens in Winter,'' [[Bernd Heinrich]] posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away.<ref name="Bernd89">{{cite book| last=Heinrich| first=Bernd| authorlink=Bernd Heinrich| year=1989| title=Ravens in Winter|location=New York|publisher=Summit Books| isbn=0-671-67809-4}}</ref> A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to eat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/lifeofbirds/brain/|title=Bird Brains|accessdate=2007-05-11|last=Davies|first=Gareth Huw|work=The Life of Birds| publisher=PBS}}</ref>
=== Breeding ===
[[Image:Ravens nest Lastef.jpg|240px|left|thumb|Young Common Ravens on a nest - Hv<U+00ED>tserkur, [[Iceland]]]]
Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics and demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location.<ref name="Oregon">{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonzoo.org/Cards/BirdsOfPrey/commonraven.htm|title= Oregon Zoo Animals: Common Raven|accessdate=2007-05-19 |format= |work= }}</ref> Sexual infidelity has been observed in Common Ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.<ref>Heinrich, B. (1999). ''Mind of the Raven: Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds'' pp 119-120. New York: Cliff Street Books. ISBN 978-0-06-093063-9</ref>

Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area.<ref name="Boarman_Heinrich"/> The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound together with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as [[deer]] fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.<ref>Savage p35</ref>

Females lay between three to seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs.<ref name="observerbook"/> Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually [[brooding]] them.<ref>{{de icon}} {{cite journal |last=Gwinner |first=Eberhard  |year=1965 |month=April |title=Beobachtungen <U+00FC>ber Nestbau und Brutpflege des Kolkraben (''Corvus corax'' L.) in Gefangenschaft |journal=Journal of Ornithology |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=145-178 |doi=10.1007/BF01793758}}</ref> Young [[fledge]] at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents.

In most of their range, egg laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in [[Greenland]] and [[Tibet]]. In [[Pakistan]], egg-laying takes place in December.<ref name="Helm"/>

=== Vocalization ===
[[Image:Raven croak.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Common Raven]] 
Like other corvids, Ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech. They have a wide range of [[vocalization]]s, which remain an object of interest to [[ornithologist]]s. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail.<ref name="Gwinner64"/> 

Fifteen to thirty categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for [[social]] interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. Non-vocal sounds produced by the Common Raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.<ref>Goodwin. p142</ref>

Common Ravens have among the largest [[brain]]s of any bird species.

One experiment designed to evaluate insight and [[problem-solving]] ability involved a piece of meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. In order to reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four out of five Common Ravens eventually succeeded, and "the transition

Common Ravens have been observed to manipulate others into doing work for them, such as by calling [[wolves]] and [[coyote]]s to the site of dead animals. The canines open the carcass, making it more accessible to the birds.<ref name=birdinblack> {{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/ravens/ravens.html|title= PBS Nature: The Bird in Black|accessdate=2007-05-07 |format= |work= |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}</ref> They watch where other Common Ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them.

Common Ravens are known to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects in order to impress other ravens.<ref>Marzluff and Angell p232</ref> Other research indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that Common Ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly [[neophobia|neophobic]].<ref>Kijne M & Kotrschal K (2002) "Neophobia affects choice of food-item size in group-foraging common ravens (''Corvus corax'')". ''Acta ethologica'' '''5'''(1): 13-18</ref> 

In recent years, biologists have begun to recognize that birds engage in [[play (activity)|play]]. Juvenile Common Ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves and dogs.<ref>Savage pp70 - 71</ref> Common Ravens are known for spectacular acrobatic displays, such as flying in loops.<ref> Savage p76</ref>

=== Conservation and management===

Common Ravens are very widely distributed and are not in danger of [[extinction]]. In some parts of their range, there have been localised declines  due to [[habitat loss]] and direct persecution. In other areas their numbers have increased dramatically and they have become [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[pest]]s. Common Ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can damage livestock, particularly by pecking out the eyes of newborn lambs and calves.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Larsen |first=Kenneth H. |coauthors=John H.

In the western [[Mojave desert]], human settlement and land development have led to an estimated 16-fold increase in the Common Raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources of food and water for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the Common Raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the [[desert tortoise]], a [[threatened species]]. Common Ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and are slow-moving.<ref name=mojave>

Across its range in the northern hemisphere, and throughout human history, the Common Raven has been a powerful symbol and a popular subject of mythology and folklore. 

It has long been considered a bird of ill omen and associated with death. As a carrion eater known to feed on humans killed by warfare or execution, the Common Raven became associated with the dead and with lost souls; in Sweden, ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people, and in Germany as the souls of the damned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=birds.raven |title=Raven: The Northern Bird of Paradox |accessdate=2007-02-12 |last=Schwan |first=Mark |year=1990 |month=January |publisher=Alaska Fish and Game}}</ref>

Many [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] of North America revered it as a [[Raven (mythology)|god]]; in [[Tlingit#Creation myth, and the Raven Cycle|Tlingit]] and [[Haida mythology|Haida cultures]], Raven was both a Trickster and Creator god. The Vikings [[Norse mythology|believed]] that ravens [[Hugin and Munin]] sat on the god [[Odin|Odin's]] shoulders and saw and heard all,<ref>{{cite web  | last=Anderson  | first=RB  | title=Prose Edda  | date=1897 | url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose2/012.php | publisher=Northvegr foundation| accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> and a [[Raven banner]] standard was carried by such Viking figures as the Norse [[Earl of Orkney|Jarls of Orkney]],<ref>{{cite book   | author = Trans.

In the [[British Isles]], ravens were also symbolic to the [[Celt]]s. In [[Irish mythology]], the goddess [[Morr<U+00ED>gan]] alighted on the hero [[C<U+00FA> Chulainn]]'s shoulder in the form of a raven after his death.<ref>{{cite web  | author = Jones, M  | title = The Death of Cu Chulainn  | publisher = Academy for Ancient Texts  | url = http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/cuchulain3.html  | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> In [[Welsh mythology]] they were associated with the Welsh god [[Bran the Blessed]], whose name translates to "raven." According to the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', Bran's head was buried in the White Hill of [[London]] as a talisman against invasion.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Ford  | first = Patrick K.  | title = The Mabinogi and Other Medieval Welsh Tales | chapter = Branwen daughter of Ll<U+0177>r  | publisher = University of California Press  | date = 1977  | location = Berkeley  | pages =   | isbn= 0-520-03414-7}}
</ref> A legend later developed that [[England]] would not fall to a foreign invader so long as there were ravens at the [[Tower of London]]; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, recent research has shown no trace of the legend before the 19th century, and it is now thought to be a romantic Victorian invention drawn from the legend of Bran the Blessed. In fact, the Tower has lacked ravens for long periods in the past; they were last reintroduced after [[World War II]]. The government now maintains several birds on the grounds of the Tower, either for insurance or to please tourists (or both).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbritain.com/TowerOfLondon.htm |title=The Tower of London |accessdate=2007-03-03 |work=AboutBritain.com |quote=...legend has it that, if they leave, the kingdom will fall. }}</ref> These birds have the primary feathers of one wing [[wing clipping|clipped]] periodically to ensure that they cannot leave.

As in traditional mythology and folklore, so the Common Raven features frequently in more modern writings such as the works of [[William Shakespeare]], and, perhaps most famously, in the poem ''[[The Raven]]'' by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Modern literature too has seen ravens in the works of [[Charles Dickens]],<ref>Dickens, Charles (1841) ''[[Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/917 online]</ref>[[J.

It continues to be used as a symbol in areas where it once had mythological status; as the [[List of national birds|National Bird]] of Bhutan,<ref name = "ravenbhutan"/> Official Bird of the [[Yukon]] territory,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gov.yk.ca/yukonglance/bird.html|title=The Official Bird| work=Yukon at a Glance| publisher=Yukon Government| accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref>, on the Coat of Arms of the [[Isle of Man]] (once a Viking colony),<ref>{{cite web  | author = Isle of Man Government  | title = Island Facts - Isle of Man Government  | work =  | publisher = Isle of Man Government  | url = http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml  | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> and even as the emblem of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[American football]] team.
