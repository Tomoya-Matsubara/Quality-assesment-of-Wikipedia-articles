'''Argon''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8><U+0251>r<U+0261><U+0252>n}}) is a [[chemical element]] designated by the symbol '''Ar'''.  Argon has [[atomic number]] 18 and is the third element in group 18 of the [[periodic table]] ([[noble gas]]es). Argon is present in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] at 0.94%. Terrestrially, it is the most abundant and most frequently used of the noble gases. Argon's full outer shell makes it stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its [[triple point]] temperature of 83.8058&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] is a defining fixed point in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]].

== Characteristics ==

[[Image:Argon ice 1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A small piece of rapidly melting argon ice.]]

Argon has approximately the same [[solubility]] in water as oxygen gas and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than [[nitrogen]] gas. Argon is colorless, odorless, tasteless and nontoxic in both its liquid and [[gaseous]] forms.  Argon is inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.

Although argon is a [[noble gas]], it has been found to have the capability of forming some compounds. For example, the creation of [[argon fluorohydride]] (HArF), a marginally stable compound of argon with [[fluorine]] and [[hydrogen]], was reported by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]] in 2000.<ref name="findarticles-harf">{{cite web|title= HArF!

== Occurrence ==

Argon constitutes 0.934% by volume and 1.29% by mass of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and air is the primary raw material used by industry to produce purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by [[fractionation]], most commonly by [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] [[fractional distillation]], a process that also produces purified [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[neon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elements.etacude.com/Ar.php |title=Argon, Ar |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>

The [[Mars|Martian]] atmosphere in contrast contains 1.6% of argon-40 and 5&nbsp;[[Parts-per notation|ppm]] of argon-36. The [[Mariner program|Mariner]] spaceprobe fly-by of the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1973 found that Mercury has a very thin atmosphere with 70% argon, believed to result from releases of the gas as a decay product from radioactive materials on the planet.  In 2005, the ''[[Cassini<U+2013>Huygens|Huygens]]'' probe also discovered the presence of argon-40 on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest moon of [[Saturn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMHB881Y3E_index_0.html |title= Seeing, touching and smelling the extraordinarily Earth-like world of Titan |accessdate=|author=|authorlink= |coauthors= |date=21 |year=05 |month=01 |format= |work= |publisher=European Space Agency |pages=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

== Isotopes ==
{{main|Isotopes of argon}}

The main [[isotope]]s of argon found on Earth are <sup>40</sup>Ar (99.6%), <sup>36</sup>Ar (0.34%), and <sup>38</sup>Ar (0.06%). Naturally occurring <sup>40</sup>[[potassium|K]] with a [[half-life]] of 1.25{{e|9}} years, decays to stable <sup>40</sup>Ar (11.2%) by [[electron capture]] and [[positron emission]], and also to stable <sup>40</sup>Ca (88.8%) via [[beta decay]]. These properties and ratios are used to determine the age of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]].<ref name=iso>{{cite web |url=http://www.geoberg.de/text/geology/07011601.php |title=40Ar/39Ar dating and errors |accessdate=2007-03-07}}

</ref>

In the Earth's [[atmosphere]], <sup>39</sup>Ar is made by [[cosmic ray]] activity, primarily with <sup>40</sup>Ar. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through [[neutron capture]] by <sup>39</sup>K or [[alpha decay|alpha emission]] by [[calcium]]. <sup>37</sup>Ar is created from the decay of <sup>40</sup>Ca as a result of subsurface [[nuclear testing|nuclear explosions]]. It has a half-life of 35 days.<ref name="iso" />

== Compounds ==
{{seealso|Van der Waals molecule|l1={{chem|H|2}}-Ar}}

Argon<U+2019>s complete octet of [[electrons]] indicates full s and p subshells.  This full outer energy level makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements.  Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds; however, compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized. In August 2000, the first argon compounds were formed by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]]. By shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, [[argon fluorohydride]] (HArF) was formed.<ref name="findarticles-harf" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/noblegases.html |title=The Noble Gases |accessdate= |author=Bartlett, Neil |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chemical & Engineering News |pages=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> It is stable up to 40&nbsp;[[kelvin]]s (<U+2212>233&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]]).

== Production ==
==== Industrial ====

Argon is produced industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]], a process that separates [[liquid nitrogen]], which boils at 77.3&nbsp;K, from argon, which boils at 87.3&nbsp;K and oxygen, which boils at 90.2&nbsp;K. About 700,000 tons of argon are produced worldwide every year. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/Ar.html |title=Periodic Table of Elements: Argon <U+2013> Ar  |publisher=Environmentalchemistry.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

==== In radioactive decays ====

[[Isotopes of argon|Argon-40]], the most abundant [[isotope]] of argon, is produced by the decay of [[potassium]]-40 with a half-life of 1.26{{e|9}} years by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]]. Because of this, it is used in [[potassium-argon dating]] to determine the age of rocks.

== Applications ==

[[Image:Argon.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Cylinders containing argon gas for use in extinguishing [[fire]] without damaging server equipment]]

There are several different reasons why argon is used in particular applications:

* An [[inert]] gas is needed. In particular, argon is the cheapest alternative when diatomic [[nitrogen]] is not sufficiently inert.
* Low [[thermal conductivity]] is required.
* The electronic properties (ionization and/or the emission spectrum) are necessary.

Other [[noble gas]]es would probably work as well in most of these applications, but argon is by far the cheapest. Argon is inexpensive since it is a byproduct of the production of [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid nitrogen]], both of which are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful since it has the highest concentration in the atmosphere. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.

=== Industrial processes ===

Argon is used in some high-temperature industrial processes, where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.

For some of these processes, the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in various types of [[metal inert gas welding]] such as [[tungsten inert gas welding]], as well as in the processing of [[titanium]] and other reactive elements. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of [[silicon]] and [[germanium]].

Argon is an asphyxiant in the poultry industry, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon's relatively high density causes it to remain close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downbound.com/Humane_Poultry_Slaughter_s/231.htm |title="Humane" Poultry Slaughter: Humane Slaughter: Animal Rights vs. Animal Welfare - Downbound.com |publisher=Downbound.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref>

Argon is sometimes used for extinguishing fires where damage to equipment is to be avoided (see photo).

===Preservative===
[[File:CsCrystals.JPG|thumb|A sample of [[caesium]] is packed under argon to avoid reactions with air]]
Argon is used to displace oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents. Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions which degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. Bottles of high-purity chemicals and certain pharmaceutical products are available in sealed bottles or ampules packed in argon. In winemaking, argon is used to top-off barrels to avoid the aerial oxidation of [[ethanol]] to [[acetic acid]] during the aging process.

Argon is also available in aerosol-type cans, which may be used to preserve compounds such as varnish, polyurethane, paint, etc. for storage after opening.<ref>US Patent 6629402</ref>

Since 2001 the American [[National Archives]] stores important national documents such as the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] within argon-filled cases to retard their degradation. Using argon reduces gas leakage, compared with the helium used in the preceding five decades. <ref>http://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html#pressrelaese1 Accessed Feb 9, 2009</ref>

=== Laboratory equipment ===
[[Image:Glovebox.jpg|thumb|Gloveboxes are typically filled with argon, which recirculate over scrubbers to maintain an oxygen- and moisture-free atmosphere]]
{{see also|air-free technique}}

Argon may be used as the [[inert gas]] within [[Schlenk line]]s and [[glovebox]]es. The use of argon over comparatively less expensive dinitrogen is preferred where nitrogen may react.

Argon may be used as the carrier gas in [[gas chromatography]] and in [[electrospray ionization mass spectrometry]]; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in [[Inductively coupled plasma|ICP]] [[spectroscopy]]. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]. Argon ions are also used for sputtering in microelectronics.

=== Medical use ===

[[Cryosurgery]] procedures such as [[cryoablation]] use liquefied argon to destroy [[cancer]] cells. In surgery it is used in a procedure called "argon enhanced coagulation" which is a form of argon plasma beam [[electrosurgery]]. The procedure carries a risk of producing [[gas embolism]] in the patient and has resulted in the death of one person via this type of accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdsr.ecri.org/summary/detail.aspx?doc_id=8248 |title= Fatal Gas Embolism Caused by Overpressurization during Laparoscopic Use of Argon Enhanced Coagulation |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=24 |year=1994 |month=June |format= |work= |publisher=MDSR |pages=  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Blue argon lasers are used in surgery to weld arteries, destroy tumors, and to correct eye defects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spie.org/Conferences/Programs/06/pw/BiOSAbstracts.pdf|format=pdf |title=Tissue Optics, Laser-Tissue Interaction, and Tissue Engineering |accessdate=2007-03-08 |last=Fujimoto |first=James |authorlink= |coauthors=Rox Anderson, R. |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Biomedical Optics |pages=77-88  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> It has also used experimentally to replace nitrogen in the breathing or decompression mix, to speed the elimination of dissolved nitrogen from the blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pilmanis Andrew A, Balldin UI, Webb James T, Krause KM |title=Staged decompression to 3.5 psi using argon-oxygen and 100% oxygen breathing mixtures |journal=Aviation, Space, Environmental Medicine |volume=74 |issue=12 |pages=1243<U+2013>50 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14692466 |doi= |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000012/art00004 }}</ref> See [[Argox (scuba)]].

=== Lighting ===

[[Image:ArTube.jpg||thumb|right|An argon & mercury vapour discharge tube.]]

[[Incandescent light]]s are filled with argon, to preserve the [[electrical filament|filaments]] at high temperature. It is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in in [[plasma globe]]s and [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimetry]] in experimental [[particle physics]].  [[Gas-discharge lamp]]s filled with argon provide blue light. Argon is also used for the creation of blue laser light.

=== Miscellaneous uses ===

It is used for [[thermal insulation]] in energy efficient [[window]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/elibrary/elibrary644.html |title=Energy-Efficient Windows |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher=Bc Hydro}}</ref> Argon is also used in technical [[scuba diving]] to inflate a [[dry suit]], because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity.<ref name=IEEE2008>{{cite journal |author=Nuckols ML, Giblo J, Wood-Putnam JL. |title=Thermal Characteristics of Diving Garments When Using Argon as a Suit Inflation Gas. |journal=Proceedings of the Oceans 08 MTS/IEEE Quebec, Canada Meeting |publisher=MTS/IEEE |date=September 15-18, 2008 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7962 |accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref>

Compressed argon is allowed to expand, to cool the seeker heads of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missile, and other missiles that use cooled thermal seeker heads. The [[AIM-9 Sidewinder#Design Architecture|gas is stored at high pressure]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.wanadoo.nl/tcc/rnlaf/aim9.html | title = Description of Aim-9 Operation | accessdate = 2009-02-01 | publisher = planken.org}} </ref>

Argon-39, with a half life of 269 years, has been used for a number of applications, primarily [[ice core]] and [[ground water]] dating. Also, [[potassium-argon dating]] is used in dating [[igneous rock]]s.

==Safety==
Although argon is non-toxic, it does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen and is thus an [[asphyxiant]]. Argon is 25% more [[density|dense]] than air and is considered highly dangerous in closed areas.  It is also difficult to detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. In confined spaces, it is known to result in death due to asphyxiation. A 1994 incident in [[Alaska]] that resulted in one fatality highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces, and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.<ref>{{cite web | last = Middaugh | first = John | coathor =  Bledsoe, Gary | url = http://www.hss.state.ak.us/dph/ipems/occupation_injury/reports/docs/94ak012.htm | title = Welder's Helper Asphyxiated in Argon-Inerted Pipe (FACE AK-94-012) | publisher =  State of Alaska Department of Public Health | date = 1994-06-23 | accessdate = 2009-02-01}}</ref>
