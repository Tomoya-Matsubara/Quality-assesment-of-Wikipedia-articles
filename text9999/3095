Heaton Park was sold to [[Manchester City Council]] in 1902, by the [[Earl of Wilton]], to be kept for the enjoyment and recreation of the public and so it has remained to this day. It has one of the United Kingdom's few concrete towers, the [[Heaton Park BT Tower]].

The park was renovated as part of a [[millennium]] project partnership between the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and Manchester City Council at a cost of over [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]10&nbsp;million.<ref name="man.gov">see http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/news_article.php?newsID=162 Retrieved 2007-10-19</ref> Some of the buildings and original vistas from the 18th century landscape design were restored.<ref>http://www.helm.org.uk/server/show/ConCaseStudy.99 Retrieved 2007-10-22</ref> The restoration of the park was singled out for an award by the British Association of Landscape Artists from 100 entries in November 2005.<ref name="man.gov"/> It contains an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, a boating lake, an animal farm, a [[pitch and putt]] course, a golf [[driving range]], woodlands, ornamental gardens, an [[observatory]], an adventure playground, a Papal Monument and a volunteer-run [[tram]]way system and museum (operational every Sunday, and [[bank holiday]], afternoon during the summer months).

== History ==
[[File:Manchester Old Town Hall.JPG|thumb|Manchester Old Town Hall, King Street]]
[[File:Manchester Old Town Hall Colonnade.jpg|thumb|Old Town Hall Colonnade]]
Heaton Hall had been owned by the Holland family since the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1684, when Sir John Egerton, 3rd [[Baronet]] of [[Wilton, Herefordshire|Wilton]] married Elizabeth Holland, the hall came to the Egerton family.<ref>http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/History__Architecture/Default.aspx Retrieved 2007-10-20</ref> In 1772, Sir [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton|Thomas Egerton]], 7th Baronet (later the 1st [[Earl of Wilton]]) commissioned the fashionable architect [[James Wyatt]], to design a new home for his young family. Although Wyatt had already established a reputation for himself as an innovative [[architect]], he was only 26 years old and Heaton Hall was his first country house commission.<ref>http://www.johansens.com/details.aspx?ID=2426&RootRegion=0&Type=2 Retrieved 2007-10-22</ref> Wyatt's [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] masterpiece was built in phases and was mostly completed by 1789.<ref name=HHP>{{cite book | last = Hartwell | first = Clare  | authorlink =  | coauthors = Hyde, Matthew; Pevsner, Nikolaus | title = Lancashire: Manchester and the South-East | year = 2004 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven and London | isbn = 0-300-10583-5 | pages = 398<U+2013>403}}</ref>

The park was originally laid out by [[William Emes]] in the style of [[Capability Brown]].<ref name=HHP/> It has long been used for public events such as Heaton Park races which were established by the second Earl in 1827. The races were run on a course on the site of the present day boating lake until 1839 when they moved to [[Aintree]] near [[Liverpool]], now the venue for the [[Grand National]].<ref>http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/History__Architecture/The_Earls_of_Wilton/ Retrieved on 2008-06-22</ref><ref>http://www.touruk.co.uk/manchester/bury.htm Retrieved on 2008-06-22</ref> During the 19th century when the [[railway]] to [[Bury]] was being laid, it stopped short of Heaton Park, as Lord Wilton was not prepared to see his estate disfigured by a railway.<ref>http://www.saveheatonpark.com/news.htm Retrieved 2007-10-14</ref> As a compromise the line was run under the estate in a tunnel and a [[Train station|railway station]] opened adjacent to the Whittaker Lane/Bury Old Road entrance in 1879 (now [[Heaton Park Metrolink station]]). Consequently, the decision by Lord Wilton to put the hall and park up for sale was greeted with dismay, especially when it became known that the site was being eyed by a property developer. A pressure group was formed to persuade [[Manchester City Council]] to purchase it as a [[museum]] and [[municipal park]]. Alderman Fletcher Moss, a prominent [[antiquarian]] was a notable influence in this movement. The park was purchased and opened to the public in 1902. Unfortunately, the council was not prepared to purchase the contents of the hall and so the furniture and paintings were sold by auction. The hall was considered by the council to be of little architectural or historical significance, and the [[state room|saloon]] was initially used as a tea-room.<ref name="galleries">see http://www.manchestergalleries.org/our-other-venues/heaton-hall/the-hall/ Retrieved 2007-10-14</ref> The city council used the hall as a branch art gallery for many years, but eventually the architectural and historical importance of the building was realised. A major restoration programme brought the [[state rooms]] back to their original appearance, and period furniture was obtained to furnish them.<ref name="galleries"/> Some of the original pieces were recovered from store or purchased at sales. Unfortunately, the exterior of the hall is still in a bad state of repair with crumbling [[stucco]], peeling paintwork and boarded-up windows. It is hoped that this will eventually be rectified with further grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The [[Manchester Pals]] used the park as a training depot during the [[First World War]], and several hutted camps were built. The park was also used as the site of a [[Royal Air Force]] depot in the [[Second World War]].

Manchester Council later used part of the north side of the park for the construction of a large gravity feed [[reservoir]], employing a contractor's railway from [[Whitefield Metrolink station|Whitefield railway station]]. This work was interrupted by the First World War, and only completed in the 1920s. A municipal [[golf course]] was also laid out, and a large boating lake excavated. The former facade of the first Manchester Town Hall on King Street was re-erected as a backdrop to the lake.

During the Second World War, two "[[Prefabricated buildings|prefab]]" housing estates and an infants school were built in the south of the park, the houses providing much-needed homes until they were demolished in the 1960s.<ref>http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/History__Architecture/The_20th_Century/Default.aspx Retrieved 2007-10-16</ref> The school building remains to this day and is used as a training centre.

== Heaton Hall ==

[[File:Lion at the South Entrance.JPG|thumb|Statue of Lion at South Entrance]]
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:The Cupola room.jpg|thumb|right|The cupola room]] -->

The hall, has been a [[Listed Building|Grade I Listed Building]] since 1952<ref>http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=388172 Retrieved on 2008-01-31</ref> and has been called "the finest house of its period in [[Lancashire]]".<ref name=HHP/> It is built of [[sandstone]] and [[stucco]]ed brick, in a traditional [[Palladian]] design with the entrance on the north side and the [[facade]] on the south. The [[landscaping]] was designed to make the most of the  uninterrupted views of the rolling hills across to the [[Pennines]]. An important feature of this was the [[ha-ha]], used to keep the [[grazing]] animals, so important to the landscaping, away from the formal lawns, with a barrier that was all-but invisible from the house.

The state rooms include the Library, the Music Room, Dining Room, and upstairs, a rather rare [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan Room]]. The rooms of the hall were exquisitely finished by the finest [[artists]] and [[craftsmen]] of the period, with most of the furnishings and [[mahogany]] doors being made by [[Robert Gillow|Gillow's]] of [[Lancashire]]. Most of the decorative paintings, the Pompeiian [[Cupola]] Room and the case for the 18th century [[chamber organ]] built by Samuel Green in 1790,<ref>Pevsner, N. (1969) ''Lancashire; 1''. Penguin Books; pp.&nbsp;328<U+2013>30</ref> were the work of Italian artist, [[Biagio Rebecca]]. The organ fills one wall of the Music Room. The ornate [[plasterwork]] was created by the firm of Joseph Rose II of [[York]].<ref name="galleries"/>

There are 13 rooms occasionally open to the public in the central core and east wing. Manchester City Galleries restored the decorative detail in the 1980s and early 1990s. The ground floor rooms on the north east front have been converted to an expansive space that houses temporary exhibitions. The first floor rooms include the [[Cupola]] which was originally Lady Egerton's dressing-room. The room was styled in the 1770s "Pompeiian" style with mirrored walls and a domed ceiling and there are only three such rooms left in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

The library was remodelled by [[Lewis Wyatt]] in the 1820s. A painting depicting one of the horseracing meetings held in the park can be seen here. The library is now licensed for [[civil partnership]] and wedding ceremonies. Heaton Hall's collections are managed by Manchester Galleries. Photography is not permitted in the hall but a collection of photographs of the hall's interior can be seen on the Manchester Art Gallery webpage.

== Landmarks and features ==

=== Temple ===
[[File:Temple Heaton Park.JPG|thumb|left|The Temple]]
Designed by [[James Wyatt]] in 1800 for the First Earl, the ornamental [[temple]] is a simple, small [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of [[Tuscan order|Tuscan columns]] with a domed roof and [[lantern]]. This Grade II [[listed building]] stands on the highest point of the [[City of Manchester]] giving views across the [[golf course]], which was originally the [[Park#Private_parks|deer park]].<ref>http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/conGap.144 Retrieved 2007-10-14</ref> It has its own fireplace and is thought to have been used as an [[observatory]] by the Earl who is known to have owned a [[telescope]] bought from [[Dollond & Aitchison|Dollond's of London]]. The cost of the telescope was <U+00A3>18.5s.0d (<U+00A3>18.25) - the same amount earned in a year by the Earl's under-[[butler]]. The temple has recently been enclosed by a stone [[balustrade]] and gravelled path and is used as a summer studio for artists, and for astronomy sessions.<ref>http://www.helm.org.uk/server/show/ConCaseStudy.99 Retrieved 2007-10-20</ref>

=== Dower House ===
[[File:Dower House and Ha-Ha.JPG|thumb|right|Dower House and ha-ha]]
The Dower House was a plain brick building that was transformed with a decorative columned [[facade]] in 1803. The [[ha-ha]] in front of the house stopped the cattle from grazing on the formal lawns, making a barrier which can't be seen from the house. In 2004 the house became the home of the [http://www.manchesterbeekeepers.co.uk/ Manchester and District Beekeepers Association] and is furnished with an observation [[Beehive|hive]], equipment and displays with an [[apiary]] in the garden behind the house.

=== Smithy Lodge ===

[[File:Smithy Lodge Heaton Park.JPG|thumb|left|Smithy Lodge]]

This pepperpot building located at the east entrance to the park, now on [[A576 road|Middleton Road]], was designed by [[Lewis Wyatt]] for the 1st Earl of Wilton in 1806. It was built in an unusual [[octagon]]al shape as a cottage to be viewed from the house in a romantic, rural setting, as well as being a home for the lodge keeper. The name comes from a [[blacksmith]]'s [[forge]] which was located nearby on Middleton Road. The lodge was fully restored with a grant from the Lottery Heritage fund in the late 1990s and is now rented out to the public as short stay accommodation.<ref name="smithy">see http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/History__Architecture/Smithy_Lodge__Grand_Lodge Retrieved 2007-10-14</ref>

=== Grand Lodge ===
[[File:Grand Lodge Heaton Park.JPG|thumb|right|Grand Lodge]]

Commissioned in 1807 by Sir Thomas Egerton, Grand Lodge was designed by [[Lewis Wyatt]] as an impressive main entrance to the park from the south. The lodge is built of [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]] as a large [[triumphal arch]] and originally led onto one of the longest carriage drives to the house. It has two floors of accommodation, cellars under the west wing and an attic over the arch. The construction of the lodge completed the enclosure of the park by a {{convert|10|ft|m|sing=on}} high boundary wall.<ref name="smithy"/> It was refurbished as part of the millennium project and is now rented out to the public as short stay accommodation. There is a memorial plaque here dedicated to the memory of the [[Manchester Pals]] who trained in the park in 1914.

=== Western Pleasure Grounds ===
[[File:The Tunnel Heaton Park.JPG|thumb|left|The Tunnel]]
These [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] gardens were probably laid out in the early nineteenth century as a peaceful retreat for the family. The gardens have recently been returned to their original design with pools, [[Summerhouse (building)|summerhouse]]s and plants appropriate to the period. A tunnel leads from the flowergarden to The [[dell (landform)|Dell]] and carries a causeway at high level across the gardens to allow the cattle, from the fields to the south of the garden, to be taken to the farm for milking without entering the gardens. The tunnel entrance is faced with large stones to give it the appearance of a natural cave.

=== Orangery ===
[[File:The Orangery.JPG|thumb|right|The Orangery]]
[[File:Orangery and Gardens Heaton Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Orangery and Gardens]]
The Orangery was added to the house by the 2nd Earl of Wilton around 1823. It appears to have been designed by [[Lewis Wyatt]] as it is similar to his [[orangery|orangeries]] at [[Tatton Park]] and [[Belton House]].  He also added the impressive [[chimney stack]]s at the same time. Heaton's Orangery has a direct access from the east wing of the house and as the wife of the 2nd Earl, Lady Mary Stanley was a keen [[botanist]] it may well have been added for her. It was designed with a domed, glazed roof, fronted by a [[formal garden]] with two large copies of the [[Borghese Vase]]. The ornate glass roof was removed, to be replaced with a flat roof after Manchester City Council purchased the park in 1902. The Orangery is now a function and conference venue, run by [[Manchester City Council]]'s Hospitality and Trading Service.<ref>http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/History__Architecture/Heaton_Hall__Orangery/Default.aspx Retrieved on 2008-06-22</ref>

=== Boating Lake ===
[[File:Boating lake, Heaton Park.jpg|thumb|left|The boating lake]]
The {{convert|12|acre|ha|adj=on|lk=on}} boating lake was constructed between 1908 and 1912 by previously unemployed men using only shovels and hand-pulled trucks. The lake, which is overlooked by the Lakeside Cafe, has three islands and is home to large numbers of ornamental birds and [[Anatidae|wildfowl]] including [[Goose|geese]], [[duck]]s, [[swan]]s and [[English Fantail|fantail dove]]s. There are rowing boats for hire during the summer months. The lake is noted for its excellent carp fishing and is also stocked with [[Cyprinidae|roach]], [[rudd]], [[bream]], [[tench]] and [[European chub|chub]].<ref>http://www.kingwilliamiv-as.members.beeb.net/ Retrieved 2007-10-17</ref> Fishing rights to all the waters in the park are held by the King William IV Angling Society.<ref>http://www.kingwilliamiv-as.members.beeb.net/ Retrieved on 2008-06-22</ref>

=== Walled Garden and Horticultural Centre ===

The 18th-century walled Garden was the Earl of Wilton's [[kitchen garden]] supplying fruit and vegetables for the estate. The walls provide a warm [[microclimate]] for crop [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] and support for climbing plants. The Horticultural Centre staff now grow plants for the city's displays and for sale to the public. There are also demonstration gardens open to the public during the summer<ref>http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/What_To_See__Do/Activities/ Retrieved 2007-10-16</ref> and a [[sensory garden]]. "The Friends of Heaton Park", a group formed in 1992 to promote an interest in the care of the park and to act as a communication link between the park users and the Heaton Park management team, are based at the centre.<ref>http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/Community_Groups/Friends_of_Heaton_Park/ Retrieved on 2008-06-22</ref>

=== Farm Centre, Stables Cafe and Animal Centre ===
[[File:Golly pond.jpg|thumb|right|Hazlitt Wood Pond]]

The farm centre was originally built as a stable block for Sir Thomas Egerton. It was designed by [[Samuel Wyatt]] and built between 1777 and 1789. It now houses the Stables cafe and is also the administrative centre for the park. The Animal Centre is housed behind the stables in the area that was Home Farm, on the site of the nineteenth century [[Greenhouse|glasshouse]] range where exotic foods and flowers were grown for the family. The Animal Centre was built in 2003<U+2013>4 to replace the old Pet's Corner and houses [[goats]], [[cattle]], [[pigs]], [[donkeys]], hebridean [[sheep]], [[alpacas]], [[Kunekune|Kune Kune pigs]] <ref>http://www.heatonpark.org.uk/HeatonPark/ Retrieved on 2008-06-22</ref> and small pets.

=== Hazlitt Wood Pond ===

The Hazlitt Wood Pond, also known as "The Golly Pond" is located in Hazlitt Wood to the far north of the park. This area of the park can only be reached on foot and hence remains quiet and secluded.

== Heaton Park Tramway ==
{{main|Heaton Park Tramway}}
[[File:Tram 765, Heaton Park.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Manchester Tram number 765|Tram number 765]] in Heaton Park]]
[[File:Tram, Heaton Park.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A horse-drawn tram in Heaton Park]]

Shortly after the Heaton Park was bought by Manchester Corporation the [[tram]]way was extended into the park and the first tram arrived on 31 May 1903, bringing visitors from Manchester. By 1934 buses were taking over from trams and the tramway was disconnected from the main system and covered in tarmac for use by buses.<ref>[http://mtms.tjhyde.co.uk/trams_in_heaton_park.htm manchester Transport Museum Society: Trams in Heaton Park] Retrieved on 2008-05-12</ref>

The Manchester Transport Museum Society (MTMS) was born in 1961 with the aim of creating a [[museum]] in which to make the society's various exhibits available to the public. It was decided that Heaton Park would be a suitable site for such a museum and proposals were made to the Parks Department of [[Manchester City Council]].

The initial idea, to construct a new tramway from Grand Lodge to Heaton Hall, was considered too expensive, as it would require remedial works to carry it across the railway tunnel. Therefore a new scheme was proposed to open up the old Manchester Corporation Tramways [[spur line|spur]] from Middleton Road to the old tram [[Tram stop|shelter]] some 300&nbsp;yards (270&nbsp;m) inside the park. The original track was buried under a layer of [[tarmac]] which had to be cleared and the old tram shelter had to be restored to form the centre of the society's operations.

The work was completed in 1979 and the Heaton Park Tramway was officially opened on the 28 March 1980.The tramway currently has an operating fleet of 3 electric trams and one horse tram.<ref>http://www.heatonparktramway.btik.com/</ref> One of these, tramcar, [[Manchester Tram number 765|No 765]], was to be seen in the [[National Tramway Museum|museum]] at [[Crich]] in Derbyshire,<ref>Bett, W. H. & Gillham, J. C. (1975?) ''The Tramways of South East Lancashire'';p. 73</ref> before moving to Heaton Park.

The operation based upon the original [[Rail siding|siding]] has since been extended (by the use of track salvaged from elsewhere), largely on a private [[Rights of way in England and Wales|right of way]] to a new [[Terminal station|terminus]] short of the boating lake. Plans exist for a further extension, perhaps as far as the hall. A major restoration of the [[Train station|depot]] and museum complex has recently (2007) been completed. A newly restored horse tram has been added to the collection. The MTMS now owns eleven tramcars ready to be brought on site when the new depot is constructed behind the boathouse at the new Lakeside terminus. The collection now includes several of the withdrawn Blackpool fleet, as well as tramcars from around the Manchester area.

== Heaton Park Golf Course ==

The municipal [[golf course]] is a picturesque, championship standard golf course, built on the former [[Park#Private_parks|deer park]] to the south of the hall with spectacular views across to the [[Pennines]]. Designed by five times Open Champion [[John Henry Taylor]], it was opened to the public in 1912 and has been the venue of many prestigious events, both professional and amateur.<ref name="Retrieved 2007-10-14">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1458&pageNumber=3|title=Heaton Park Golf Centre: Championship Golf Course|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=14 October 2007|page=3}}</ref> The golf centre, which has its own private [[driving range]] used for teaching purposes, is located at the Smithy Lodge, Middleton Road entrance to Heaton Park. The course has an undulating, championship length layout within which three picturesque lakes play a prominent part.

== Activity in the park ==

In 1909, the great Italian tenor, [[Enrico Caruso]], performed at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[Manchester]]. The concert was attended by one William Grimshaw, a [[Phonograph|gramophone]] salesman from [[Prestwich]] and a few days later, he took his gramophone to Heaton Park and played recordings of the songs performed by Caruso to an assembled crowd of 40,000 people who, according to the ''Prestwich and Heaton Park Guardian'', "remained as if spellbound from the moment of arrival to the close of the programme, which, it is hardly necessary to say, was intensely enjoyed." Caruso later wrote to Mr. Grimshaw to thank him for the way his voice had been reproduced, sending him a signed [[cartoon]] of himself. Grimshaw was the first person in England to give gramophone concerts in the open, an idea which soon spread across the country. The concerts were carried on for several seasons and as they grew in popularity, Grimshaw became known across [[Lancashire]] as "the gramophone King"<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/09/09/caruso_concert_090905_feature.shtml Retrieved 2007-10-17</ref>

Since the 1980s a number of open air pop [[concert]]s have been held in the park, headlined by popular bands of the day such as [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Supergrass]]. On 31 May 1982 [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the park for over 100,000 people and [[ordain]]ed 12 new priests.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/04/03/pope_heaton_park_feature.shtml Retrieved 2007-10-16</ref> This event is commemorated by the papal monument in the south-west of the park

In recent years the park has hosted some open-air theatre productions. In 2005 there was a performance of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Midsummer Night's Dream]]. In the same year there was a sell out production of [[Dracula]] by Feelgood Theatre Productions as well as a [[Stella Artois]]Screening of [[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]] with a film inspired set from the [[Fun Lovin' Criminals]].

In 2006 Feelgood returned with a performance of [[King Arthur|Arthur]] - King of the [[Brython|Britons]]. Feelgood also runs a series of acting and writing workshops in the park. The park has been the venue for the [[BBC]]'s "[[Proms]] in the Park" on a number of occasions. There are often charity run events such as the [[Race for Life]] and seasonal fairs are located near the Papal Monument. There is a large [[bonfire]] and [[firework display]] held on the 5th of November ([[Guy Fawkes Night]]) each year. The Shakespeare's Globe Theatre performs open-air theatre annually with performances of Shakespeare's greatest works in 2008, 2009 and A Midsummer Night's Dream in June 2010.

== Goals Soccer Centre ==
A proposed sports development to be built and operated by Goals Soccer Centres is currently under consideration for [[Planning Permission|planning permission]] by Manchester City Council Planning Committee.<ref name="publicaccess.manchester.gov.uk">http://www.publicaccess.manchester.gov.uk/publicaccess/tdc/DcApplication/application_detailview.aspx?caseno=KLDML5BC02600 Retrieved 2010-01-27</ref>

=== Proposal details ===
The proposal is to build twelve [[five-a-side football]] pitches, one [[Five-a-side football#Variations|seven-a-side football]] pitch, six tennis courts and a climbing tower. They will be served by a detached building with changing rooms, a cafe and a bar.<ref name="publicaccess.manchester.gov.uk"/>
Floodlighting was originally proposed to be 8&nbsp;m above the pitches, though the amendment to the pitch levels leaves the lighting 7.2&nbsp;m above the playing surface. Light levels surrounding the site are to be between 5 and 10 [[lux]] at 10&nbsp;m from the boundary.<ref>http://www.publicaccess.manchester.gov.uk/associateddocs/selecteddoc.aspx?090370-SSI-0002.pdf Retrieved 2010-01-27</ref>
The pitches will be raised 0.8&nbsp;m above the current ground level, with each pitch surrounded by rebound boards. Two sides of the site will be bordered by 2.4&nbsp;m high acoustic fence boards and it will be surrounded by a 5&nbsp;m high net. There will also be a 2&nbsp;m high security fence surrounding the site and also from the park boundary wall, along the north side of the development and then turning north to the reservoir. The total area of the site will be approximately {{convert|8|acre|ha}}. With the facilities open from 10am until 11pm daily, community groups would be able to use the facilities for free at off-peak times, although off-peak has not yet been defined. Heaton Park was chosen as the site of the development in response to the current level of sports facility provision in North Manchester, no other location was considered.<ref>http://www.publicaccess.manchester.gov.uk/associateddocs/selecteddoc.aspx?090370-SSI-0007.pdf</ref> In the Demonstration of Very Special Circumstances submitted as part of the planning application, the JJB Soccer Centre near the Trafford Centre is identified as the only similar facility within a 20 minute drive.

=== Objections ===
Objections to the proposals include the visual and physical impact on the character of the park, increased noise levels in a currently quiet area, increased traffic and parking problems on local roads and the effect on wildlife in the area.
The St Margarets corner of Heaton Park is home to a number of bats, the Bat Survey conducted for the Goals Soccer Centre planning application found Pipistrelle and [[Noctule bat]]s but states that is merely a snapshot of two nights in the park and there may be other species present. According to the Bat Survey, which looked at trees scheduled for felling for evidence of roosting, bats may be disturbed by light levels as low as 0.06 lux. The application states elsewhere that light levels 10&nbsp;m from the boundary, a distance that includes the woodland the bats roost in, will be between 5 and 10 lux.
