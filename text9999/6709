{{dablink|This article is about the 1942 film. For other uses, see [[Casablanca (disambiguation)]].}}

'''''Casablanca''''' is a [[1942 in film|1942]] [[film]] set during [[World War II]] in the [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled [[Morocco|Moroccan]] city of [[Casablanca]]. The film was directed by [[Michael Curtiz]], and stars [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Rick Blaine and [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Ilsa Lund. It focuses on Rick's conflict between, in the words of one character, [[love]] and [[virtue]]: he must choose between his love for Ilsa and his need to do the right thing by helping her husband, [[Resistance movement#World War II|Resistance]] hero Victor Laszlo, escape from Casablanca and continue his fight against the [[Nazism|Nazis]].

The film was an immediate hit, and it has remained consistently popular ever since. [[Film critic|Critic]]s have praised the charismatic performances of Bogart and Bergman, the chemistry between the two leads, the depth of [[Fictional character|characterisation]], the taut [[Film director|direction]], the witty [[screenplay]] and the emotional impact of the work as a whole. 

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}

[[Humphrey Bogart]] plays Rick Blaine, the owner of an upscale cafe/bar/gambling den in the [[Moroccan]] city of [[Casablanca]] which attracts a mixed clientele of [[Vichy French]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials, refugees and thieves. Rick is a bitter and cynical man, but still displays a clear dislike for the [[fascism|fascist]] part of his clientele.

A petty crook, Guillermo Ugarte ([[Peter Lorre]]), arrives in Rick's club with "letters of transit" he has obtained by killing some German couriers. The papers are signed by a French general (the pronunciation is muffled, it may be [[Charles de Gaulle]] or [[Maxime Weygand]]), and allow the bearer to travel at will around Nazi-controlled Europe, including to neutral [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and from there to the [[United States of America|United States]]. These papers are almost priceless to any of the continual stream of refugees who end up stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to make his fortune by selling them to the highest bidder, who is due to arrive at the club later that night. However, before the exchange can take place, he is killed trying to evade the local police, under the command of Rick's close friend Captain Renault ([[Claude Rains]]). As a corrupt Vichy official, Renault accommodates the Nazis, but remains ambivalent about their influence in Casablanca.  Unbeknownst to either Renault or the Nazis, Ugarte had left the letters with Rick for safekeeping, because "...somehow, just because you despise me, you are the only one I trust."

At this point, the reason for Rick's bitterness re-enters his life. His ex-lover, Ilsa Lund ([[Ingrid Bergman|Bergman]]) arrives with her husband, Victor Laszlo ([[Paul Henreid|Henreid]]), to purchase the letters. Laszlo is a famous [[Resistance movement#World War II|Resistance]] leader from [[Czechoslovakia]] with a huge price on his head, and they must have the letters to escape. At the time Ilsa first met and fell in love with Rick in Paris, she believed her husband had been killed by the Nazis. When she discovered that Laszlo was in fact alive, she left Rick abruptly without explanation and returned to Laszlo, leaving Rick to feel betrayed.

The trio's awkward conversation is interrupted when a group of [[Germany|German]] officers, led by Major Strasser ([[Conrad Veidt]]), begin to sing the ''[[Die Wacht am Rhein|Wacht am Rhein]],'' a German patriotic song from the [[nineteenth century]] (the producers wanted to use the Nazi ''[[Horst Wessel Lied]]'', but it was copyrighted by a German publisher).  Laszlo tells the house band to play ''[[La Marseillaise]]''.  The French customers join in and drown out the Germans. In retaliation, Strasser orders Renault to close the club.

Despite initially refusing to give the documents to Ilsa, even at gunpoint, Rick eventually decides to help Laszlo. He and Ilsa reaffirm their love for each other and she believes that she will stay with Rick when Laszlo leaves. Captain Renault is forced at gunpoint to assist in the escape.  At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa get on the plane with Laszlo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed. "Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life." Rick shoots Major Strasser when he tries to intervene. When the police arrive, Renault saves his life by telling them to "round up the usual suspects". He then suggests that they both go join the [[Free French]]. They disappear into the fog with one of the most memorable exit lines in movie history: "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."

==Production==
[[Image:Casabl meetrick.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The main characters, from left to right: Rick Blaine, Captain Renault, Victor Laszlo and Ilsa Lund]]

The film was based on [[Murray Burnett]] and [[Joan Alison]]'s unproduced [[play]] ''[[Everybody Comes to Rick's]]''.  The story analyst at [[Warner Brothers]] who read the play called it (approvingly) "sophisticated hokum", and the rights were bought for $20,000.  The project was renamed ''Casablanca'', apparently in imitation of the 1938 hit ''[[Algiers (film)|Algiers]]''.
Shooting began on [[May 25]], [[1942]] and was completed on August 3.

The entire film was shot in the studio, except for the sequence showing the arrival of Major Strasser (filmed at [[Van Nuys Airport]]).   The street used for the exterior shots had recently been built for another film, ''[[The Desert Song]]'', and was redecorated and used again in ''Casablanca'' for the [[Paris]] [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s.   It remained on the Warners [[backlot]] until the 1960s.
The set for Rick's cafe was built in three unconnected parts, so the internal geography of the building is indeterminate, and in a number of scenes the camera looks through a wall from the cafe area into Rick's office.  The final scene includes [[midget]] [[extra (actor)|extra]]s as aircraft personnel walking around a model cardboard [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior|plane]], because of budgetary and wartime rationing constraints. The [[fog]] in the scene was there to mask the unconvincing appearance of the plane.   Bergman's height caused some problems: she was somewhat taller than Bogart, so in their scenes together he sometimes had to be put on boxes or cushions.

The film cost a total of $950,000, which was slightly over budget but an average cost for a film of the time.   Bogart was called in a month after shooting was finished to dub in the final line ("Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.")   Later, there were plans for a further scene to be shot (featuring Renault, Rick and a detachment of [[Free French]] fighters on a ship), but these were abandoned.   

===Writing===
The original play was inspired by a 1938 trip to Europe by Murray Burnett, during which he visited [[Vienna]] and the [[France|French]] south coast, both of which had uneasily coexisting populations of Nazis and refugees.   In the play, the Ilsa character was American, and did not meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris had ended; Rick was a lawyer.

The first main writers to work on the script for Warners were the Epstein twins ([[Julius J. Epstein|Julius]] and [[Philip G. Epstein|Philip]]), who removed Rick's background and added more elements of [[comedy]].   The other credited writer, [[Howard Koch]], joined later but continued to work in parallel with the Epsteins, despite their differing emphases (Koch highlighting the [[political]] and [[melodrama|melodramatic]] elements).   Important scenes were also added by the uncredited [[Casey Robinson]], who contributed the series of meetings between Rick and Ilsa in the cafe.  Curtiz seems to have favoured the [[Romantic love| romantic]] element, insisting on retaining the [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] Paris scenes.   One of the most famous lines<U+2014> "here's looking at you"<U+2014> is not in the draft screenplays, and has been attributed to the [[poker]] lessons Bogart was giving Bergman in between takes. 
The final line of the film was written by the [[film producer|producer]] [[Hal Wallis]] after shooting had been completed, and film critic [[Roger Ebert]] calls Wallis the "key creative force" for his attention to the details of production (down to insisting on a real [[parrot]] in the Blue Parrot bar).<ref name="Ebertcommentary">Ebert, Roger.  Commentary to ''Casablanca'' (Two-Disc Special Edition DVD).</ref>

Despite the many different writers, the film has what Ebert describes as a "wonderfully unified and consistent" script.  Critic [[Andrew Sarris]] called it "the most decisive exception to the [[auteur theory]]".<ref>Sarris, Andrew (1968). ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929-1968'' (New York: Dutton, 1968), p. 176.</ref>  Koch later said that it was the tensions between his own approach and that of Curtiz which accounted for this: "surprisingly, these disparate approaches somehow meshed, and perhaps it was partly this tug of war between Curtiz and me that gave the film a certain balance".<ref>Quoted in Sorel, Edward (1990). [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/8/1991_8_92.shtml Footnotes to History<U+201D>] in ''American Heritage'' February 19990.</ref>  Julius Epstein would later note that the screenplay contained "more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined. But when corn works, there's nothing better."<ref>Quoted in [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/News/01/01/euroshorts/ 'Casablanca' writer dies at 91] on CNN.com, [[January 1]] [[2001]].</ref>

The film ran into some trouble from [[Joseph Breen]] of the [[production code|Production Code Administration]] (the [[Hollywood]] self-censorship body), who opposed the suggestions that Captain Renault extorted sexual favours from his supplicants and that Rick and Ilsa had slept together in Paris.   Both, however, are strongly implied in the finished version.

===Direction===
The [[Film director|director]], [[Michael Curtiz]], was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] emigre; he had come to the U.S. in the 1920s, but some of his family were refugees from Nazi Europe.  
[[Roger Ebert]] has commented that in Casablanca "very few [[Shot (film)|shot]]s ... are memorable as shots", Curtiz being concerned to use images to tell the story rather than for their own sake.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />  However, he had relatively little input into the development of the plot: Casey Robinson said that Curtiz "knew nothing whatever about story... he saw it in pictures, and you supplied the stories".<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote">Quoted in Ebert commentary.</ref>

The second unit [[Film editing|montage]]s, such as that showing the invasion of France, were directed by [[Don Siegel]].

===Cinematography===
[[Image:Cross of Lorraine.jpg|left|thumb|100px|The [[Cross of Lorraine]], emblem of the Free French]]The [[cinematographer]] was [[Arthur Edeson]], a veteran who had previously shot ''[[The Maltese Falcon#1941 Film|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''.  Particular attention was paid to photographing Bergman: she was shot mainly from her preferred left side, often with a softening gauze filter and with [[catch light]]s to make her eyes sparkle.   The whole effect is to make her face "ineffably sad and tender and nostalgic".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />   Bars of shadow across the characters and in the background variously imply imprisonment, the [[crucifix]], the [[Free French]] symbol and emotional turmoil.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />   
Dark ''[[film noir]]'' and [[expressionist]] lighting is used in several scenes, particularly towards the end of the picture.

===Music===
The [[Film score|score]] was written by [[Max Steiner]], who was best known for the musical score to ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. The song "[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]" by [[Herman Hupfeld]] had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to write his own song to replace it, but he had to abandon his plan because Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role, and could not re-shoot the scenes which mentioned the song.   Instead, Steiner based the entire score on it (and on "[[The Marseillaise]]"), transforming them to express the changing mood of the movie.   Particularly notable is the "duel of the songs", in which "[[The Marseillaise]]" is played by a full [[orchestra]] rather than just the small band actually present in Rick's club, competing against the Germans singing "[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]" at the piano.  Other songs include "It Had to Be You" from 1924 with lyrics by [[Gus Kahn]] and music by [[Isham Jones]], and "Knock on Wood" with music by [[M.K. Jerome]] and lyrics by [[Jack Scholl]].

==Reception==
Reaction to the film at previews before release was described as "beyond belief".  It premiered at the Hollywood Theater in [[New York City]] on [[November 26]], [[1942]].  It was a substantial box-office hit, taking $3.7 million on its initial U.S. release, and went on to win three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s, while ''As Time Goes By'' spent 21 weeks on the [[hit parade]].   As Koch later said, "it was a picture the audiences needed... there were values... worth making sacrifices for.  And it said it in a very entertaining way." However, not everyone liked the film, including some critics in the [[French New Wave]].  American movie critic [[Manny Farber]] was less enthusiastic as well.  In his book ''Negative Space'', he calls the picture "Casablank" and states it has wrongly become a classic. 

The film has maintained its popularity: Murray Burnett has called it "true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow".   During the 1950s, the [[Brattle Theater]] of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] began a long-running tradition of screening ''Casablanca'' during the week of final exams at [[Harvard University]].  This tradition continues to the present day, and it is emulated by many colleges across the [[United States]].  It is also credited with helping the movie remain popular while other famous films of the 1940s have faded away.

However, there has been anecdotal evidence that Casablanca may have made a deeper impression among film-lovers than within the professional movie-making establishment. In the November/December 1982 issue of "American Film", Chuck Ross claimed that he had retyped the screenplay to Casablanca, using the playscript name "Everybody Comes to Ricks'"; submitting it to 217 agencies. 85 of them read it, 38 rejecting it outright, 33 generally recognized it (but only 8 specifically recognized it as Casablanca), 3 declared it commercially viable, and 1 suggested turning it into a novel. 

===Criticism===
Roger Ebert has claimed that the film is "probably on more lists of the [[Films that have been considered the greatest ever|greatest films of all time]] than any other single title, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]''", because of its wider appeal; while ''Citizen Kane'' is "greater", ''Casablanca'' is more loved.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />   Behlmer also emphasises the variety in the picture: "it<U+2019>s a blend of [[drama]], [[melodrama]], [[comedy]] [and] intrigue".   Ebert says that he has never heard of a negative review of the film, even though individual elements can be criticised (he cites the unrealistic [[special effect]]s and the stiff character/portrayal of Laszlo).<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote" />

Ebert has also said that the film is popular because "the people in it are all so good".  As the Resistance hero, Laszlo is ostensibly the most good, although he is so stiff that he is hard to like.<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />   The other characters, in [[Rudy Behlmer]]'s words, are "not cut and dried": they come into their goodness in the course of the film.   Renault begins the film as a collaborator with the Nazis, who extorts sexual favours from [[refugee]]s and has Ugarte killed in custody.  Rick, according to Behlmer, is "not a hero, ... not a bad guy": he does what is necessary to get along with the authorities and "sticks his neck out for nobody".   Even Ilsa, the least active of the main characters, is "caught in the emotional struggle" over which man she really loves.  By the end of the film, however, "everybody is sacrificing".

A dissenting note comes from [[Umberto Eco]], who wrote that "by any strict critical standards... ''Casablanca'' is a very mediocre film".   
He sees the changes the characters undergo as inconsistency rather than complexity: "It is a comic strip, a hotch-potch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects".   However, he argues that it is this inconsistency which accounts for the film's popularity by allowing it to include a whole series of [[archetype]]s: unhappy [[love]], flight, passage, waiting, [[Sexual attraction|desire]], the triumph of purity, the faithful servant, the [[love triangle]], [[beauty and the beast]], the enigmatic woman, the ambiguous adventurer and the redeemed [[drunkard]].   Central is the idea of [[sacrifice]]: "the [[mythology|myth]] of sacrifice runs through the whole film".<ref>Eco, Umberto (1994). ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'' (Sonia Maasik and Jack Solomon, eds.)  Bedford Books.</ref>

===Parodies===
The film has been parodied several times, by
*the [[Marx Brothers]] in ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946)
*[[Woody Allen]] in ''[[Play It Again, Sam]]'' (1972)
*[[Neil Simon]] in ''[[The Cheap Detective]]'' (1978), which combines the story with that of ''[[The Maltese Falcon]]''
*[[Warner Brothers]] itself in ''[[Carrotblanca]]'', a 1995 [[Bugs Bunny]] [[cartoon]]. This cartoon is included on the special edition [[DVD]] release of the film.
*the [[30 Second Bunny Theater|''30 Second Bunny Theater'']] has added a 30 second remake of Casablanca to its online library of parodies, which is viewable at [http://www.angryalien.com/0506/casabunca.asp ''Bunny Theater's Casablanca''].

[[Image:Casablanca (colorized).jpg|right|thumb|Scenes from the controversial and rare colorized version of the film.]]
''Casablanca'' was also part of the [[film colorization]] controversy during the 1980s when a color version of the film aired on [[Australia|Australian]] television. The color version was briefly made available on home video, but its unpopularity with film fans caused the altered version to fade away, though copies occasionally appear on [[eBay]].

One Simpsons episode involved the discovery of a happy ending for the film.

==Sequels==
Almost from the moment ''Casablanca'' became a hit, talk began of producing a sequel to the film. A sequel entitled ''Brazzaville'' (named after the capital city of the [[Republic of the Congo]], mentioned in the final scene) was planned, but never produced. 

There  have been two short-lived [[television]] series based upon ''Casablanca'', both of which are considered [[prequel]]s to the movie. The first aired in 1955 (with [[Charles McGraw]] as Rick and [[Marcel Dalio]], who played Emil the [[croupier]] in the movie, as Renault).  Another series in 1983 starred [[David Soul]] as Rick and included [[Ray Liotta]] as Sacha and [[Scatman Crothers]] as a somewhat elderly Sam.

In the 1980s and 1990s media reports occasionally arose about plans to either produce a sequel, or an outright remake of ''Casablanca'', but as of 2006 no studio has seriously put such plans into action. To date the only authorized sequel to ''Casablanca'' has been the novel, ''As Time Goes By'', written by [[Michael Walsh]].

A [[radio]] adaptation of the film was broadcast on [[April 26]] [[1943]], again starring Bogart, Bergman and Henreid, while a second version of [[January 24]] [[1944]] featured [[Hedy Lamarr]] as Ilsa.

==Cast==
The cast is notable for its internationalism: only three of the credited actors were born in the U.S.   The three top-billed actors were:
*[[Humphrey Bogart]] as Rick Blaine.   Bogart became a star with ''Casablanca''.   Earlier in his career he had been [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a [[gangster]], playing characters called Bugs, Rocks, Turkey, Whip, Chips, Gloves and Duke (twice).   [[High Sierra]] (1941) had allowed him to play a character with some warmth, but Rick was his first truly romantic role.  
*[[Ingrid Bergman]] as Ilsa Lund.   Bergman's official website calls Ilsa her "most famous and enduring role".      After a well-received [[Hollywood]] debut in [[Intermezzo (1939 movie)|Intermezzo]], her subsequent films had not been major successes<U+2014> until ''Casablanca''.   Ebert calls her "luminous", and comments on the chemistry between her and Bogart: "she paints his face with her eyes".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />
*[[Paul Henreid]] as Victor Laszlo.   Henreid, an [[Austria]]n actor who had fled Nazi Germany in 1935, was reportedly reluctant to take this unrewarding role (it "cast him as a stiff forever", according to [[Pauline Kael]]), until he was promised top-billing with Bogart and Bergman.

The second-billed actors were:
*[[Claude Rains]] as Captain Louis Renault.  Rains was an [[England|English]] actor, born in [[London]].  He had previously worked with Michael Curtiz on ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''.
*[[Sydney Greenstreet]] as Signor Ferrari, a rival clubowner.  Another Englishman, Greenstreet had made his film debut with Lorre and Bogart in ''[[The Maltese Falcon]]''. 
*[[Peter Lorre]] as Signor Ugarte.  Lorre was an Austrian-German character actor who left Germany in 1933.
*[[Conrad Veidt]] as Major Strasser of the [[SS]].  He was a German actor who had appeared in ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) before fleeing from the Nazis and ending his career playing Nazis in U.S. films.

Also credited were:
*[[Dooley Wilson]] as Sam.   He was one of the few American members of the cast.   A [[drummer]], he could not play the piano.   Hal Wallis considered also dubbing his voice on the songs, but changed his mind. 
*[[Joy Page]] (Annina Brandel, the [[Bulgaria]]n refugee), the other credited American, was studio head [[Jack Warner]]'s step-daughter.
*[[Madeleine LeBeau]] (Yvonne, Rick's girlfriend of the moment), a French actress, was Marcel Dalio's wife until their [[divorce]] in 1942.
*[[S.Z. Sakall|S.Z. (or S. K.) "Cuddles" Sakall]] (Carl, the waiter) was a Hungarian actor who fled from Germany in 1939.
*[[Curt Bois]] (the pickpocket) was a German [[Jew]]ish actor and another refugee.  He could claim the longest film career of any actor, making his first appearance in 1907 and his last in 1987.
*[[John Qualen]] (Berger) was born in [[Canada]], but grew up in America. He appeared in many of [[John Ford]]'s movies.
*[[Leonid Kinskey]] (Sascha) was born in [[Russia]].

Notable uncredited actors were:
* [[Marcel Dalio]] (Emil, the [[croupier]]).  He had been a star in French cinema, appearing in [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' and ''[[The Rules of the Game|La Regle de Jeu]]'', but after he fled the Nazi invasion of France he was reduced to bit parts in Hollywood.  He also was a key performer in another film with Bogart, ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''.
* [[Helmut Dantine]] (Jan Brandel), another Austrian, had spent time in a [[concentration camp]] after the [[Anschluss]].

Part of the emotional impact of the film has been attributed to the large proportion of European exiles and [[refugee]]s among the [[extra]]s and in the minor roles.   A witness to the filming of the "duel of the songs" sequence said, "half of the extras had real tears in their eyes... most of these people were singing out of their own experience as refugees from Nazi Germany".<ref name="Ebertcommentaryquote" />

==Myths==
Several myths have grown up around the film, one being that [[Ronald Reagan]] was originally chosen to play Rick.   This originates in a press release issued by the [[movie studio|studio]] early on in the film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was due to go into the army, and he was never seriously considered.

The other most famous myth is that the actors did not know until the last day of shooting how the film was to end.   The original play (set entirely in the cafe) had ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Victor to the [[airport]].   During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Behlmer points out, "there was only one dramatically viable real possibility: Ilsa and Laszlo take the plane".   It was certainly impossible that Ilsa would leave Laszlo for Rick, as the [[production code]] forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man.
The confusion was most likely caused by Bergman's later statement that she didn't know which man she was meant to be in love with.  However, [[Aljean Harmetz]]' examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end: any confusion was, in Ebert's words, "emotional", not "factual".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />

The letters of transit are a subject of some confusion. Some viewers have the impression that Ugarte says the letters are signed by "[[Maxime Weygand|General Weygand]]." English subtitles on the official DVD read "de Gaulle," and the latter name is heard by many others. The French subtitles say "Weygand." See also [[Casablanca (film)#Errors|Errors]]. ''{{Audio|Lettersoftransit.ogg|listen}}''

Another famous myth is that Bergman asks Dooley Wilson, the piano player, to "play it again, Sam," see [[Casablanca (film)#Quotes|Quotes]].

==Errors==
The film has several apparent logical flaws, foremost being the two "letters of transit" which enable anyone to leave for abroad. As mentioned before, it is unclear whether Ugarte says the letters have been signed by [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] General [[Maxime Weygand]] or then [[Free French]] leader General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Weygand had been the Vichy French Delegate for the [[French colonial empire|North-African Colonies]] until a month before the film is set (and a year after it was written). De Gaulle was at the time the head of the Free French government, which was considered a rebel movement by the Vichy government actually controlling Morocco. A Vichy French [[court martial]] had convicted De Gaulle to life ''in absentia'' with charges of treason on [[August 2]], [[1940]]. Thus, it seems unlikely that a letter signed by him might grant free transit through Vichy French territories at the time.
A classic [[MacGuffin]], the letters were invented by Joan Allison for the original play and never questioned.   Even within the film, Rick suggests to Renault that the letters would not be enough for Ilsa to escape, let alone Laszlo: "people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights".   

In the film, as Laszlo says, the Nazis cannot arrest him as "we're on free French soil; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault".   However "it makes no sense that he could walk around freely" in Casablanca, as Ebert points out: "he would be arrested on sight".<ref name="Ebertcommentary" />

Other difficulties are the airport [[searchlight]] which is pointed at the cafe rather than into the sky; a [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error at the station in Paris (Rick's wet coat becomes dry when he gets on the train); and Renault's claim that "I was with [the Americans] when they blundered into [[Berlin]] in 1918."  Curtiz's attitude to these issues was clear <U+2014> he said, "I make it go so fast, nobody notices".

Finally, the movie shows a wrong flag of [[French Morocco]] that consists of a [[Flag of France|French tricolour]] with the [[islam]]ic symbol (crescent moon and star) in the middle[http://flagspot.net/images/m/ma_fr!cb.gif]. In 1942, the flag of the French Protectorate of Morocco was [[Flag of Morocco|the same that today independent Morocco]], and the civil ensign consisted of a common Moroccan flag with white fimbriated French flag in the canton[http://flagspot.net/images/m/ma_39f.gif].

==Awards==
''Casablanca'' won three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s:
*[[Academy Award for Best Picture]] <U+2014> [[Hal B. Wallis]], producer
*[[Academy Award for Directing]] <U+2014> [[Michael Curtiz]]
*[[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]] <U+2014> [[Julius J. Epstein]], [[Philip G. Epstein]] and [[Howard Koch]]
It was also nominated for another five Oscars:
*[[Academy Award for Best Actor]] <U+2014> [[Humphrey Bogart]]
*[[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] <U+2014> [[Claude Rains]]
*[[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]], black-and-white <U+2014> [[Arthur Edeson]]
*[[Academy Award for Film Editing]] <U+2014> [[Owen Marks]]
*[[Academy Award for Original Music Score]] <U+2014> [[Max Steiner]]

In 1989 the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]], while in 1998 it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as the second greatest American film (after ''[[Citizen Kane]]''). In 2005, it was named one of the 100 greatest films of the last 80 years by time.com.

In 2006, the [[Writers Guild of America]] voted the [[screenplay]] of ''Casablanca'' as the best of all time, in its 101 Greatest Screenplays vote.  [http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1807]

==Quotes==
{{wikiquote|Casablanca}}

Ilsa says "Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake"; in response, Sam tries to lie, saying "I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa"; and she says "Play it, Sam. Play '[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]].' "  When Rick hears the song, not realizing yet that Ilsa is there, he rushes up and says "I thought I told you never to play that." Later, alone with Sam, he says "You played it for her and you can play it for me", and then "If she can stand it, I can! Play it!" In ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'', all this dialogue was parodied using the line "Play it again, Sam" <U+2014> a phrase which has incorrectly become associated with the original film.

The line "Here's looking at you, kid", spoken by Rick to Ilsa, was voted in a 2005 poll by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[100 Years Series#100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|fifth most memorable line]] in cinema history [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200506/s1398449.htm].  Six lines from Casablanca appeared in the top 100, by far the most of any film (Gone With The Wind and The Wizard of Oz had three apiece). The others were: "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." (20th),  "Play it, Sam.  Play 'As Time Goes By.'" (28th), "Round up the usual suspects." (32nd), "We'll always have Paris." (43rd), and "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine." (67th).
