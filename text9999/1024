'''Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>be<U+026A>d<U+0259>n <U+02C8>po<U+028A>.<U+0259>l}}) [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (22 February 1857&nbsp;<U+2013> 8 January 1941), also known as '''B-P''' or '''Lord Baden-Powell''', was a [[Lieutenant-General (UK)|lieutenant-general]] in the [[British Army]], writer, and founder of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]].

After having been educated at [[Charterhouse School]], Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the [[Siege of Mafeking]]. Several of his military books, written for [[military]] [[reconnaissance]] and scout training in his African years, were also read by boys. Based on those earlier books, he wrote ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', published in 1908 by [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Pearson]], for youth readership. During writing, he tested his ideas through a [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camping trip on Brownsea Island]] with the local [[Boys' Brigade]] and sons of his friends that began on 1 August 1907, which is now seen as the beginning of Scouting.

After his marriage to [[Olave Baden-Powell|Olave St Clair Soames]], Baden-Powell, his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] and notably his wife actively gave guidance to the Scouting Movement and the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides Movement]]. Baden-Powell lived his last years in [[Nyeri]], [[Kenya]], where he died and was buried in 1941.

== Early life ==
Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell, or more familiarly as Stephe Powell, at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), [[Paddington]] in London, on 22 February 1857.<ref name="jeal">{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Jeal |authorlink=Tim Jeal |title=[[Baden-Powell (book)|Baden-Powell]] |publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] |location=London |year=1989 |isbn=0-09-170670-X}}</ref> [[Robert Stephenson]], the railway and civil engineer being his godfather and namesake.<ref name="Robert Stephenson Trust">{{cite web |url=http://www.robertstephensontrust.com/page24.html |work=Robert Stephenson Trust |title=The life of Robert Stephenson&nbsp;<U+2014> A Timeline |accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref> His father [[Reverend]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]], a [[Savilian Professor of Geometry]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], already had four teenage children from the second of his two previous marriages. On 10 March 1846 at St Luke's Church, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], Reverend Powell married Henrietta Grace Smyth (3 September 1824&nbsp;<U+2013> 13 October 1914), eldest daughter of Admiral [[William Henry Smyth]] and 28 years his junior. Quickly they had [[Warington Baden-Powell|Warington]] (early 1847), [[George Baden-Powell|George]] (late 1847), [[Augustus Baden-Powell|Augustus]] (1849) and [[Francis Baden-Powell|Francis]] (1850). After three further children who died when very young, they had Stephe, [[Agnes Baden-Powell|Agnes]] (1858) and [[Baden Baden-Powell|Baden]] (1860). The three youngest children and the often ill Augustus were close friends. Reverend Powell died when Stephe was three, and as tribute to his father and to set her own children apart from their half-siblings and cousins, the mother changed the family name to ''Baden-Powell''. Subsequently, Stephe was raised by his mother, a strong woman who was determined that her children would succeed. Baden-Powell would say of her in 1933 "The whole secret of my getting on, lay with my mother."<ref name="jeal" /><ref name="palstra">{{cite book |first=Theo P.M. |last=Palstra |title=Baden-Powel, zijn leven en werk |publisher=De Nationale Padvindersraad |city=Den Haag |month=April |year=1967}}</ref><ref name="drewery">{{cite book |first=Mary |last=Drewery |title=Baden-Powell: The Man Who Lived Twice |publisher=[[Hodder and Stoughton]] |city=London |year=1975 |isbn=0-340-18102-8}}</ref>

After attending Rose Hill School, [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], during which his favourite brother Augustus died, Stephe Baden-Powell was awarded a scholarship to [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], a prestigious [[public school (England)|public school]]. His first introduction to Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds. He also played the [[piano]] and [[violin]], was an [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] artist, and enjoyed [[acting]]. Holidays were spent on [[yachting]] or [[canoeing]] expeditions with his brothers.<ref name="jeal"/>

== Military career ==
In 1876, R.S.S. Baden-Powell, as he styled himself then, joined the [[13th Light Dragoons|13th Hussars]] in India with the rank of [[lieutenant]]. He enhanced and honed his [[Reconnaissance|military scouting]] skills amidst the [[Zulu]] in the early 1880s in the [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal province]] of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. During one of his travels, he came across a large string of wooden beads, worn by the Zulu king [[Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo|Dinizulu]], which was later incorporated into the [[Wood Badge]] training programme he started after he founded the Scouting Movement. Baden-Powell's skills impressed his superiors and he was [[Brevet (military)|Brevetted Major]] as Military Secretary and senior [[Aide-de-camp]] of the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of [[Malta]], his uncle General Sir [[Henry Augustus Smyth]].<ref name="jeal"/> He was posted in Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] for the Director of [[Military intelligence|Military Intelligence]].<ref name="jeal"/> He frequently travelled disguised as a [[Insect collecting|butterfly collector]], incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings.<ref name="butterfly">{{cite web |last=Baden-Powell |first=Sir Robert |year=1915 |url=http://pinetreeweb.com/bp-adventure02.htm |title=My Adventures As A Spy |publisher=Pine Tree Web |accessdate=17 June 2009}}</ref>

Baden-Powell returned to Africa in 1896 to aid the [[British South Africa Company]] colonials under siege in [[Bulawayo]] during the [[Second Matabele War]].<ref name="matabele">{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Baden-Powell |title=The Matabele Campaign, 1896 |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1897 |isbn=0837135664}}</ref> This was a formative experience for him not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in [[Matobo National Park|Matobo Hills]], but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here.<ref name="proctor">{{cite journal |first=Tammy M. |last=Proctor | year=2000 |month=July |title=A Separate Path: Scouting and Guiding in Interwar South Africa |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=42 |issue=3 |issn=3548-1356}}</ref> It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], who introduced Baden-Powell to the [[American Old West]] and ''woodcraft'' (i.e., [[scoutcraft]]), and here that he wore his signature [[Stetson]] [[campaign hat]] and [[kerchief]] for the first time.<ref name="jeal"/> After [[Rhodesia]], Baden-Powell took part in a successful British invasion of [[Ashanti]], West Africa in the Fourth [[Anglo-Asante Wars|Ashanti War]], and at the age of 40 was promoted to lead the [[5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Dragoon Guards|5th Dragoon Guards]] in 1897 in India.<ref name="barrett">{{cite book |first=C.R.B. |last=Barrett |title=History of The XIII. Hussars |publisher=William Blackwood and Sons |location=Edinburgh and London |year=1911 |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-hussars.htm |accessdate=2 January 2007}}</ref> A few years later he wrote a small manual, entitled ''Aids to Scouting,'' a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, to help train recruits. Using this and other methods he was able to train them to think independently, use their initiative, and survive in the wilderness.

Baden-Powell was accused of illegally executing a prisoner of war, Matabele chief Uwini, in 1896, who had been promised his life would be spared if he surrendered. Uwini was shot by firing squad under Baden-Powell's instructions. Baden-Powell was cleared by an inquiry, and later claimed he was "released without a stain on my character". Robin Clay, Baden-Powell's grandson, commented in 2009, "We all make mistakes."<ref>{{Cite news |coauthors=Cristina Ruiz and Maurice Chittenden

He returned to South Africa prior to the [[Second Boer War]] and was engaged in further military actions against the Zulus. By this time, he had been promoted to be the youngest [[colonel]] in the [[British Army]]. He was responsible for the organisation of a force of [[Legion of Frontiersmen]] to assist the regular army. While arranging this, he was trapped in the [[Siege of Mafeking]], and surrounded by a Boer army, at times in excess of 8,000 men. Although wholly outnumbered, the garrison withstood the siege for 217 days. Much of this is attributable to cunning military deceptions instituted at Baden-Powell's behest as commander of the garrison. Fake minefields were planted and his soldiers were ordered to simulate avoiding non-existent [[barbed wire]] while moving between trenches.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jon |last=Latimer |title=Deception in War |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2001 |pages=32<U+2013>5}}</ref> Baden-Powell did most of the reconnaissance work himself.<ref name="boer">{{cite web |last=Conan-Doyle |first=Sir Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Conan Doyle |year=1901 |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/conan-doyle-mafeking.htm |title=The Siege of Mafeking |publisher=Pine Tree Web |accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref>
In one instance noting that the Boers had not removed the rail line, Baden-Powell loaded an armoured locomotive with sharpshooters and successfully sent it down the rails into the heart of the Boer encampment and back again in a strategic attempt to decapitate the Boer leadership. 

Contrary views of Baden-Powell's actions during the Siege of Mafeking pointed out that his success in resisting the Boers was secured at the expense of the lives of the native African soldiers and civilians, including members of his own African garrison. Pakenham stated that Baden-Powell drastically reduced the rations to the natives' garrison.<ref name="pakenham">{{cite book |last=Pakenham |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Pakenham (historian) |title=The Boer War |year=1979 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-72001-9}}</ref> However, in 2001, after subsequent research, Pakenham decidedly retreated from this position.<ref name="jeal"/><ref name="pakenham2">{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Pakenham |title=The Siege of Mafeking |year=2001}}</ref>

[[File:Baden Powell.jpg|thumb|Baden-Powell on patriotic postcard in 1900]]

During the siege, a [[Mafeking Cadet Corps|cadet corps]], consisting of white boys below fighting age, was used to stand guard, carry messages, assist in hospitals and so on, freeing the men for military service. Although Baden-Powell did not form this cadet corps himself, and there is no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege, he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an object lesson in the first chapter of ''Scouting for Boys''. The siege was lifted in the [[Siege of Mafeking|Relief of Mafeking]] on 16 May 1900. Promoted to [[Major-General|major-general]], Baden-Powell became a national hero.<ref name="NPG">{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/display/robert-baden-powell.php |title=Robert Baden-Powell: Defender of Mafeking and Founder of the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides |work=Past Exhibition Archive |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] |accessdate=17 November 2006}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> After organising the [[South African Police Service|South African Constabulary]], the national police force, he returned to England to take up a post as [[Inspector General]] of Cavalry in 1903. In 1907 he was appointed to command a division in the newly-formed [[Territorial Force]].<ref>Reported as "a Yorkshire division" in ''The Times'', 29 October 1907, p.6; the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' lists it as the [[Northumbrian Division]], which encompassed units from the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire as well as Northumbria proper.</ref>

In 1910 Lieutenant-General Baden-Powell decided to retire from the Army reputedly on the advice of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], who suggested that he could better serve his country by promoting Scouting.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ej0P_lyMEFkC&pg=PR55 |title=Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship |first1=Robert |last1=Baden-Powell |first2=Robert |last2=Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell Baden-Powell of Gilwell |first3=Elleke |last3=Boehmer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780192802460 |page=lv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wivenhoe.gov.uk/Orgs/WSGA/about_badenpowell.htm |title=Lord Robert Baden-Powell "B-P"&nbsp;<U+2013> Chief Scout of the World |work=The Wivenhoe Encyclopedia |accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref>

On the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Baden-Powell put himself at the disposal of the War Office. No command, however, was given him, for, as [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] said: "he could lay his hand on several competent divisional generals but could find no one who could carry on the invaluable work of the Boy Scouts."<ref name="saunders">{{cite book |first=Hilary |last=Saint George Saunders |title=The Left Handshake |chapter=Chapter II, ENTERPRISE, Lord Baden-Powell |year=1948 |url=http://pinetreeweb.com/bp-memorial.htm |accessdate=2 January 2007}}</ref> It was widely rumoured that Baden-Powell was engaged in spying, and intelligence officers took great care to [[wikt:inculcate|inculcate]] the myth.<ref name="matebele">{{cite web |last=Baden-Powell |first=Sir Robert |year=1915 |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-adventure01.htm |title=My Adventures as a Spy |publisher=PineTree.web |accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref>

On his return from Africa in 1903, Baden-Powell found that his military training manual, ''Aids to Scouting'', had become a best-seller, and was being used by teachers and youth organisations.<ref name="best-seller">{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Robert |year=2003 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0310/d-wwas.html |title=Marching to a Different Drummer |work=Scouting |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2 January 2007}}</ref> Following his involvement in the [[Boys' Brigade]] as Brigade Secretary and Officer in charge of its scouting section, with encouragement from his friend, [[William Alexander Smith (Boys' Brigade)|William Alexander Smith]], Baden-Powell decided to re-write ''Aids to Scouting'' to suit a youth readership. In August 1907 he held a [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camp on Brownsea Island]] for twenty-two boys from local Boys Brigade companies and sons of friends of Baden-Powell's from public schools Eton and Harrow to test out the applicability of his ideas. Baden-Powell was also influenced by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], who founded the [[Woodcraft Indians]]. Seton gave Baden-Powell a copy of his book ''The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians'' and they met in 1906.<ref name="SetonInfed">{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/seton.htm |title=Ernest Thompson Seton and Woodcraft |publisher=InFed |accessdate=7 December 2006}}</ref><ref name="BPInfed">{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm |title=Robert Baden-Powell as and Educational Innovator |publisher=InFed |accessdate=7 December 2006}}</ref> The first book on the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]], Baden-Powell's ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was published in six instalments in 1908, and has sold approximately 150 million copies as the [[List of best-selling books|fourth bestselling book]] of the 20th century.<ref>Extrapolation for global range of other language publications, and related to the number of [[Scouting|Scouts]], make a realistic estimate of 100 to 150 million books.

Boys and girls spontaneously formed [[Scout troop]]s and the [[Scouting]] Movement had inadvertently started, first as a national, and soon an international obsession. The Scouting Movement was to grow up in friendly parallel relations with the Boys' Brigade. [[Crystal Palace Rally|A rally for all Scouts]] was held at [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in London in 1909, at which Baden-Powell discovered the first [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Scouts]]. The [[Girl Guide]] Movement was subsequently founded in 1910 under the auspices of Baden-Powell's sister, Agnes Baden-Powell. Baden-Powell's friend, [[Juliette Gordon Low]], was encouraged by him to bring the Movement to America, where she founded the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].

In 1920, the [[1st World Scout Jamboree]] took place in [[Olympia, London|Olympia]], and Baden-Powell was acclaimed [[Chief Scout (United Kingdom)|Chief Scout]] of the World. Baden-Powell was created a [[Baronet]] in the 1921 New Year Honours and [[Baron Baden-Powell]], of Gilwell, in the County of Essex, on 17 September 1929, [[Gilwell Park]] being the International Scout Leader training centre.<ref name="ThePeerage">{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p876.htm#i8753 |title=Family history, Person Page 876 |publisher=The Peerage |accessdate=1 January 2007}}</ref> After receiving this honour, Baden-Powell mostly styled himself "Baden-Powell of Gilwell".

In 1929, during the [[3rd World Scout Jamboree]], he received as a present a new 20 horse power [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles [[travel trailer|Caravan]].<ref name="jamroll">{{cite web |url=http://www.jamroll.org/ |title=What ever happened to Baden-Powell's Rolls Royce? |accessdate=8 November 2008}}</ref> This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around Europe. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at [[Gilwell Park]]. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by [[Olave Baden-Powell]] in 1945. Jam Roll and Eccles were reunited at Gilwell for the [[21st World Scout Jamboree]] in 2007. Recently it has been purchased on behalf of Scouting and is owned by a charity, B-P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds are being raised to repay the loan that was used to purchase the car.<ref name="jamroll" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/jamroll.htm |title="Johnny" Walker's Scouting Milestones |accessdate=3 September 2008}}</ref> Baden-Powell also had a positive impact on improvements in youth education.<ref name="education">{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm |work=Infed Thinkers |title=Baden-Powell as an Educational Innovator |accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref> Under his dedicated command the world Scouting Movement grew. By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was in excess of 3.3&nbsp;million.<ref name="nagy">{{cite book |first=L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> |last=Nagy |authorlink=L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Nagy (Scouting) |title=250 Million Scouts |publisher=[[World Scout Foundation]] |location=Geneva |year=1985}}</ref>

At the [[5th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1937, Baden-Powell gave his farewell to Scouting, and retired from public Scouting life. 22 February, the joint birthday of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, continues to be marked as [[World Thinking Day|Founder's Day]] by Scouts and [[Thinking Day]] by Guides to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World.

In his final letter to the Scouts, Baden-Powell wrote:
<blockquote>...I have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to have a happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. 'Be Prepared' in this way, to live happy and to die happy&nbsp;<U+2014> stick to your Scout Promise always&nbsp;<U+2014> even after you have ceased to be a boy&nbsp;<U+2014> and God help you to do it.<ref name="finalspeech">{{cite web |last=Baden-Powell |first=Sir Robert |url=http://guidinguk.freeservers.com/B-P.html |title=B-P's final letter to the Scouts |publisher=Girl Guiding UK |accessdate=4 August 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

The Baden-Powells had three children, one son and two daughters, who all acquired the courtesy title of "[[The Honourable]]" in 1929 as children of a baron. The son succeeded his father in 1941 to the Baden-Powell barony and the title of [[Baron Baden-Powell]].<ref name="ThePeerage" />

In 1939, he and his wife moved to a cottage he had commissioned in [[Nyeri]], [[Kenya]], near [[Mount Kenya]], where he had previously been to recuperate. The small one-room house, which he named ''Paxtu'', was located on the grounds of the [[Outspan Hotel]], owned by [[Eric Sherbrooke Walker]], Baden-Powell's first private secretary and one of the first Scout inspectors.<ref name="jeal"/> Walker also owned the [[Treetops Hotel]], approx 17&nbsp;km out in the [[Aberdare Range|Aberdare Mountains]], often visited by Baden-Powell and people of the [[Happy Valley set]]. The Paxtu cottage is integrated into the Outspan Hotel buildings and serves as a small Scouting museum.

=== Personal beliefs ===
[[File:'Are you in this' poster.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[World War I]] propaganda poster drawn by Baden-Powell]]
Jeal argues that Baden-Powell's distrust of [[communism]] led to his implicit support, through na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9>, of [[fascism]]. In 1939 Baden-Powell noted in his diary: "Lay up all day. Read ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organization etc.-and ideals which [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] does not practise himself."<ref name="jeal"/>{{rp|550}}

Baden-Powell admired [[Benito Mussolini]] early in the Italian fascist leader's career and some early Scouting badges had a [[swastika]] symbol on them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elearning.scgs.qld.edu.au/learningfederation/drs/R2944/description.html |title=Boy Scout medal with fleur-de-lis and swastika, 1930s |accessdate=3 September 2008 |publisher=The Learning Federation}}</ref> According to Rosenthal, Baden-Powell used the swastika because he was a [[Nazi]] sympathizer. Jeal, however, argues that Baden-Powell was [[na<U+00EF>ve]] of the symbol's growing association with fascism and maintained that his use of the symbol related to its earlier, original meaning of "good luck" in [[Sanskrit]], for which purpose the symbol had been used for centuries prior to the rise of fascism.   In conflict with the idea that Powell was a Nazi supporter is the fact that Baden-Powell was a target of the Nazi regime in [[the Black Book]], which listed individuals who were to be arrested during and after an invasion of Great Britain as part of [[Operation Sealion]]. Scouting was regarded as a dangerous spy organization by the Nazis.<ref name="blackbook">{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Schellenberg |authorlink=Tim Jeal |title=Invasion, 1940: The Nazi Invasion Plan for Britain |work=[[Imperial War Museum]] |publisher=St Ermin's Press |location=London |year=2000}}</ref>

=== Artist and writer ===
Baden-Powell made paintings and drawings almost every day of his life. Most have a humorous or informative character.<ref name="jeal"/> He published books and other texts during his years of military service both to finance his life and to educate his men.<ref name="jeal"/>

Baden-Powell was regarded as an excellent storyteller. During his whole life he told 'ripping yarns' to audiences.<ref name="jeal"/> After having published ''Scouting for Boys'', Baden-Powell kept on writing more handbooks and educative materials for all Scouts, as well as directives for Scout Leaders. In his later years, he also wrote about the Scout Movement and his ideas for its future. He spent the last decade of his life in Africa, and many of this later books had African themes.
Currently, many pages of his field diary, complete with drawings, are on display at the [[National Scouting Museum]] in [[Irving, Texas]].

=== Sexuality ===
Early discussion of Baden-Powell's sexuality focused on his relationship with his close friend [[Kenneth McLaren]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Eminent Edwardians |last=Brendon |first=Piers |authorlink=Piers Brendon |publisher=Martin Secker & Warburg |year=1979 |isbn=0-436-06810-9}}</ref>{{rp |217<U+2013>218}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Character Factory: Baden-Powell and the Origins of the Boy Scout Movement |last=Rosenthal |first=Michael |publisher=Pantheon Books |year=1986 |isbn=0-394-51169-7}}</ref>{{rp |48}} [[Tim Jeal]]'s later biography ''[[Baden-Powell (book)|Baden-Powell]]'' discusses the relationship and concludes that there is no evidence that this friendship was physical<ref name="jeal"/>{{rp |82}}. Jeal then examines Baden-Powell's views on women, his appreciation of the male form, his military relationships and his marriage, indicating that Baden-Powell could be a [[Latent homosexuality|repressed homosexual]].<ref name="jeal"/>{{rp |103}} Jeal's conclusion is disputed, but not yet examined in any detail by scholars.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Block |editor1-first=Nelson R. |editor2-last=Proctor |editor2-first=Tammy M. |title=Scouting Frontiers: Youth and the Scout Movement<U+2019>s First Century |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |year=2009 |page=6 |isbn=1-4438-0450-9 }}</ref>{{rp |6}}

The [[Silver Wolf Award]] worn by Robert Baden-Powell is handed down the line of his successors, with the current Chief Scout, [[Bear Grylls]] wearing this original award.

The [[Bronze Wolf Award]], the only distinction of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]], awarded by the [[World Scout Committee]] for exceptional services to world Scouting, was first awarded to Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then ''International Committee'' on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in [[Stockholm]] in 1935. He was also the first recipient of the [[Silver Buffalo Award]] in 1926, the highest award conferred by the [[Boy Scouts of America]].

In 1927 at the Swedish National Jamboree he was awarded by the [[Scouting in Austria|<U+00D6>sterreichischer Pfadfinderbund]] with the "''Gro<U+00DF>es Dankabzeichen des <U+00D6>PB''.<ref name="Pribich">{{cite book |last=Pribich |first=Kurt |title=Logbuch der Pfadfinderverb<U+00E4>nde in <U+00D6>sterreich |publisher=Pfadfinder-Gilde-<U+00D6>sterreichs |year=2004 |location=Vienna |language=German}}</ref>{{rp |113}}
