The northern part of this bypass was completed and became [[New Jersey Route 154|Route 154]] in 1953. The road has seen many changes including the replacement of the [[traffic circle]] with Routes 38 and 73 with an interchange that involved realigning Route 41 around the original circle in 1960 and the replacement of the [[Ellisburg Circle]] at [[New Jersey Route 70|Routes 70]] and 154 with a signalized intersection in the early 1990s. The temporary alignment of Route 41 along County Route 573 was made permanent in the early 2000s.<ref name=alpsroads />

==History==
[[Image:Route 42 & 41 exit.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Northbound [[New Jersey Route 42|Route 42]] at the Route 41 interchange in [[Deptford Township, New Jersey|Deptford Township]], which was reconstructed in the early 2000s.]]Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from [[New Jersey Route 47|Route 47]] in [[Fairview, Gloucester County, New Jersey|Fairview]] in [[Deptford Township, New Jersey|Deptford Township]] to [[New Jersey Route 38|Route 38]] in [[Moorestown, New Jersey|Moorestown]] along its current alignment, except through [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]], which it was to bypass to the east.<ref name=alpsroads /><ref name="Map" /> Also legislated in 1927 was a spur of Route 41, [[New Jersey Route S41|Route S41]], which was to run from the [[Tacony-Palmyra Bridge]] to [[Berlin, New Jersey|Berlin]]. Later spurs of Route 41 included [[New Jersey Route S41A|Route S41A]], which was a southern extension of Route S41 from Berlin to [[New Jersey Route 42|Route 42]] (now [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 322]]) in [[Folsom, New Jersey|Folsom]] proposed in 1938 and [[New Jersey Route S41N|Route S41N]], a short route in [[Palmyra, New Jersey|Palmyra]].<ref name=alpsroads />  In the [[1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering]], Routes S41 and S41A became [[New Jersey Route 73|Route 73]] and Route S41N became [[New Jersey Route 155|Route 155]]. Also, Route 41 was legislaied along a county-maintained temporary route between [[New Jersey Route 168|Route 168]] in [[Runnemede, New Jersey|Runnemede]] and [[New Jersey Route 70|Route 70]] in [[Cherry Hill Township, New Jersey|Cherry Hill Township]], signed '''Route 41 Temporary''', when it became the apparent the bypass around Haddonfield would not be fully completed. Only the northermost section of the bypass between [[County Route 561 (New Jersey)|County Route 561]] and Route 70 had been built and this became [[New Jersey Route 154|Route 154]].  The county-maintained section of Route 41 also became known as County Route 573.<ref name=alpsroads />  

Since 1953, many changes have occurred along Route 41. Following reconstruction of the traffic circle between Routes 38, 41, and 73 into an interchange in 1960, Route 41 was relocated to a new alignment that bypassed the original traffic circle. In 1984, Route 41 was extended north a short distance on Kings Highway to just south of the County Route 608 (Lenola Road) intersection in [[Maple Shade Township, New Jersey|Maple Shade Township]].<ref name=alpsroads /> In the early 1990s, the [[Ellisburg Circle]] at the intersection of Routes 41, 70, and 154 was reconstructed into an intersection with [[jughandles]] and traffic lights. This reconstruction involved realigning Route 41 to form a brief concurrency with Route 154 just south of Route 70.<ref name=alpsroads2>{{cite web|url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/nj/log/9.html#154 | title=New Jersey Roads <U+2013> NJ State Highways <U+2013> 151-170|author=Alpert, Steve|publisher=Alps' Roads|accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref> In the early 2000s, the Route 41 interchange with Route 42 in Deptford Township was, along with the [[County Route 544 (New Jersey)|County Route 544]] interchange with Route 42, reconstructed to ease traffic movements in the area.<ref name=phillyroads>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyroads.com/roads/NJ-42/|title=NJ 42 Freeway|author=Anderson, Steve|publisher=Eastern Roads|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> Around 2001, signs for Route 41 Temporary were replaced wirth normal Route 41 signs along the county-maintained portion of Route 41 concurrent with County Route 573.<ref name=alpsroads />  Signs for County Route 573 still remain along this stretch of Route 41.<ref name=alpsroads3>{{cite web|url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/nj/nj_41/| title=New Jersey Roads <U+2013> NJ 41/CR 573 |author=Alpert, Steve|publisher=Alps' Roads|accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>
