==Biography==
===Early life===
James Lance Bass was born to James Irvin Bass, Jr., a [[medical laboratory|medical lab]] technician, and Diane Bass, a [[Primary education|middle school]] [[mathematics]] teacher,<ref name="Professions">{{cite web|title = Fame A Natural Fit For Bass|last=Watkins|first=Billy.|publisher = The Clarion Ledger| date = [[August 9]] [[2003]]|url =http://www.clarionledger.com/news/0308/09/m01.html  |accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> in [[Laurel, Mississippi]].<ref name="Larry King">{{cite web|title = 'N Sync Discusses Their Rise to Stardom|work=Larry King Live|publisher = [[CNN.com]]| date = [[January 9]] [[2001]]|url =  http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/09/lkl.00.html|accessdate = 2006-10-11}}</ref> He has one older sister named Stacy.<ref name="Sister" /> Bass was raised in the town of [[Ellisville, Mississippi]] as "a strict [[Southern Baptist]], in the steep shadow of the church", and has described his family as a "completely traditional Southern family".<ref name="Autobio2" /> At a young age, Bass developed a fascination with [[space]], and, at age 9, traveled to [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]] with his father and grandfather to watch his first live space shuttle launch. Of this experience he said, "I was certain from then on that that my future was to be involved with space."<ref name="Autobio2" /> Bass attended [[U.S. Space Camp|space camp]] the following year,<ref name="space">{{cite web | title=Lance Bass ...

When Bass was 10 years old, his father was transferred to a different hospital, and the family packed up and moved to [[Clinton, Mississippi]].<ref name="Autobio2" /> There, Bass began singing in his church choir and as a chorus member in his school. While a student at [[Clinton High School (Mississippi)|Clinton High School]], Bass joined [[Mississippi Show Stoppers]], a state-wide group sponsored by the Mississippi [[Agriculture]] and [[Forestry]] Museum, and was a member of Attach<U+00E9>, a competitive [[show choir]] group that traveled across the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportshollywood.com/askbass.html |title=10 Questions with Lance Bass |accessdate=2007-09-27 |last=Bailey |first=Karen |coauthors=and Jeff Hause |year=2000 |publisher=Sports Hollywood}}</ref> One of Bass's vocal coaches during his time in the Mississippi Show Stoppers was Bob Westbrook, a professional vocal coach who had previously worked with young performers [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Britney Spears]].<ref name="Professions" /> Westbrook's connection to Timberlake would later play a large role in Bass joining 'N Sync.

Along with being a member of the Showstoppers and Attach<U+00E9>, Bass was a member of a seven-man vocal group called Seven Card Stud, which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for [[Senator]] [[Trent Lott]].<ref name=Autobio10-15>{{cite book|last = Bass|first = Lance|title = Out of Sync|pages = 10-15 }}</ref> Bass was also elected vice president of his junior class, and has said that he was "extremely popular" among the female contingent of his high school because, "I never tried to do anything that was considered too forward or out of bounds. I was a very polite, safe date."<ref name="Autobio10-15" />

==='N Sync===
{{main|'N Sync}}
In 1995, Bass joined Justin Timberlake, [[JC Chasez]], [[Chris Kirkpatrick]] and [[Joey Fatone]] in the [[boy band]] 'N Sync, after the original bass singer, Jason Watkins, quit the group.<ref name="Watkins">{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.celebritypro.com/bio/nsync_bio.htm |title='NSYNC Biography |accessdate=2007-10-25 |publisher=CelebrityPro.com}}</ref> In need of a replacement, the group began searching. Timberlake recruited Bass, following a recommendation by their mutual vocal coach, Westbrook.<ref name="Professions" /> Timberlake later said that the group had to convince Bass's mother to let her son join, as they were told she would "never let him do it".<ref name="Larry King" /> 'N Sync toured [[Germany]] throughout 1996, before hitting it big in the United States two years later. In 2000, the group released the fastest-selling record of all time, ''[[No Strings Attached]]'',<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | author=BBC |title=

Bass has said that he felt betrayed when 'N Sync went through much-publicized legal battles with [[Lou Pearlman]] in 1999. Of Pearlman, who has since been imprisoned for various [[bank fraud]] charges, Bass has said, "I had thought of Lou as a member of the family, but I felt that I'd been completely screwed over...

Despite criticisms received after ''On The Line'', Bass has gone on to make several other film appearances, with [[cameo]]s in both ''[[Zoolander]]'' and [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Cursed (film)|Cursed]]''. In the 2007 film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'', Bass played a wedding singer.<ref name="Sister" /> Bass has also lent his voice to several animated television programs, such as ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' and [[Disney]]'s ''[[Kim Possible]]'' and ''[[Higglytown Heroes]]''.<ref name="Voice Acting">{{cite web|date=[[June 6]], [[2005]]|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showactor.php?actorid=3646  |title=Lance Bass: Voice Actor Profile |publisher=VoiceChasers.com|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> In the gaming world, Bass was the voice of [[Sephiroth]] in the successful [[action role-playing game]], [[Kingdom Hearts]].<ref name="Voice Acting" /> He did not reprise his role in the sequel, [[Kingdom Hearts 2]].

{{main|Out of Sync}}
Bass's [[autobiography]], "Out Of Sync", was published on [[October 23]], [[2007]].<ref name="Book" /> It was co-written by ''New York Times'' best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book's introduction, and was published by [[Simon Spotlight Entertainment]], a division of [[Simon & Schuster]].<ref name ="Simon & Schuster">{{cite web |author=Simon Spotlight Entertainment |url=http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&pid=536749 |title=Simon & Schuster: Out of Sync |accessdate=2007-09-28 |publisher=Simon & Schuster}}</ref><ref name="NYTimesBook">{{cite web |author=Ryzik, Melena |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/fashion/21lance.html?ref=fashion |title=Boy-Band Grad's Next Act |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as "the first chapter" in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a seat on a Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass's decision to go public with his sexuality.<ref name="Book" /> Bass does not hold back his true feelings about 'N Sync's 2004 decision to go on "permanent hiatus", expressing anger and confusion when bandmate Timberlake left the band to pursue a solo career.<ref name="NYTimesBook" />

==Spaceflight plans==
[[Image:Lancesoyuz.jpg|left|thumb|Bass, Commander [[Sergei Zalyotin]], and Flight Engineer [[Frank De Winne]] during familiarization training at the [[Johnson Space Center]].]]
In August 2002, Bass entered [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] training in [[Star City, Russia]]. Bass was originally supposed to be the host of a space competition show to be entitled "The Big Mission", in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian [[Soyuz]] [[space capsule]]. However, the game show concept fell apart when the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. The producers came up with the idea of using Bass when, while sitting with a friend and discussing the space project, the friend's daughter shouted out, "Lance Bass wants to go into space!" The girl, who was an 'N Sync fan, learned of Bass's lifelong dream of space travel when she read it in an online chat, and suggested Bass to the producers.<ref name=Autobio107-137>{{cite book|last = Bass|first = Lance|title = Out of Sync|pages = 107-137}}</ref>

[[Image:Bassnasa.jpg|150px|thumb|Bass's official cosmonaut photo]]
Of the opportunity to go to space, Bass said, "I am completely overwhelmed at the invitation. I'm looking forward to completing this lifelong dream. I am honored and privileged to represent my country in this history-making mission."<ref name="space"/> Before being cleared for training, Bass had to participate in weeks of medical screening at the Institute for Bio-Medical Problems near [[Moscow, Russia]].<ref name="Radio Shack">{{cite web|date=[[July 6]], [[2002]]|url=http://www.comspacewatch.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=7820 |title=Radio Shack Kicks off Lance Bass Mission to Orbit  |publisher=Comspacewatch.com|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> In order to be admitted into training, Bass agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct [[cardiac arrythmia]], which was discovered in 1999 when he collapsed after a concert.<ref name="Heart Surgery">{{cite web|date=[[May 17]], [[2002]]|url=http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2002-05-17#celeb4  |title=Lance Bass Has Heart Surgery |publisher=WENN|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Bass's training included [[weightlessness|parabolic flights]], space flight theory, learning how to eat and drink in space, underwater training, and intense physical training, including daily four mile runs.<ref name="Space Chat">{{cite web| date = [[May 17]] [[2005]]| url =http://www.space-explorers.com/internal/events/viewlog.html?bass2005| title =Space Explorers Chat Hosted by Lance Bass| publisher =Space-Explorers.com| accessdate =2007-07-15}}</ref> The training also included "survival training" for different climactic and geographical areas, in case there were complications with his shuttle landing; it was reported that Bass had to "learn shooting techniques to defend himself against wolves and other predators, in addition to basic preservation skills such as building a shelter and starting a fire."<ref name="Survival Skills">{{cite web|author=Vineyard, Jennifer and Cornell, Jeff.|date=[[July 6]], [[2002]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456018/20020710/n_sync.jhtml |title=Lance Bass Headed For Black Sea |publisher=MTV News|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref>  In order to communicate with his fellow cosmonauts, Bass had to learn the [[Russian language]] from a tutor who spoke only [[French language|French]].<ref name="Space Chat" />

After several months of training, Bass received cosmonaut certification and was scheduled to fly into space on the [[Soyuz TMA-1]] mission that was to be launched on [[October 30]], [[2002]]. The capsule was scheduled to fly to the [[International Space Station]], and land in a desert in [[Kazakhstan]].<ref name="Cosmonaut 2" /> When Bass's original deal with the major network that was set to air his documentary fell through, Bass's camp turned to [[MTV]], who briefly agreed to sponsor the trip, but then backed out over "payment, insurance, and indemnification issues".<ref name="Autobio107-137" /> Shortly after, all of Bass's other sponsorships fell through, including one sponsor that pulled out because they worried about the image of their brand possibly being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission.<ref name="Autobio107-137" /> Bass was eventually kicked out of the program, and Russian cosmonaut [[Yuri Lonchakov]], along with an empty container, ended up taking his place.<ref name="Yuri" /> The capsule successfully landed on [[May 4]], [[2003]], Bass's 24th birthday.

Bass's failed space attempt landed him on People magazine's list of "2002's Losers", coming in fourth place behind [[Michael Jackson]], [[George Michael]], and [[Senator]] [[Trent Lott]].<ref name="Losers">{{cite web | title=Michael Jackson Tops "2002's Losers" | publisher = IMDB | url= http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2002-12-23#celeb1| accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> On [[September 26]], [[2002]], rumors began to surface that Bass was "depressed and suicidal" after his attempts at space travel had failed.<ref name="Suicide Rumor">{{cite web| author=User "canalbaby" - scroll to September 27 entry|date = [[September 27]] [[2002]] | url =http://canalbaby.livejournal.com/63406.html| title = 'N Sync Chronology| publisher =LiveJournal | accessdate =2006-10-16}}</ref> Bass's camp denied reports, with one [[Jive Records]] executive saying, "Lance is a very happy person and I'm sure he's got more in his life than this trip, so I'd be very surprised if he got that upset about it all."<ref name="Suicide Rumor" /> In his 2007 autobiography, Bass wrote that his failure to make it onto the Soyuz mission was "extremely embarrassing" and left him in a state of emotional exhaustion. "I had lost thirty pounds during this ordeal. Even the green in my eyes had faded... I was hurt really bad."<ref name="Autobio107-137" />

In October 2004, during [[World Space Week]], Bass was formally inducted as a member of the [[National Space Society]]'s [[Board of Governors]]. Serving in an advisory and public outreach capacity, Bass has joined astronauts and prominent individuals who have made a lasting, positive impact on human [[space exploration]], including actor [[Tom Hanks]], journalist [[Hugh Downs]] and author and futurist Sir [[Arthur C.

Bass, who knew that he was gay since age five,<ref name="Autobio2" /><ref name =20/20>{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aENbkXKLrpI | title=Lance Bass on 20/20 | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=2007-10-19 | author=User "CigaretteSmokerFiona" |date=19 October 2007}}</ref> has said that the image of 'N Sync was one of the main reasons for keeping his sexuality hidden. In his coming out interview, Bass stated, "I knew that I was in this popular band and I had four other guys' careers in my hand, and I knew that if I ever acted on it, or even said [that I was gay], it would overpower everything."<ref name="Sister" /> Bass has stated that, while there were many rules the members of 'N Sync had to follow in order to uphold their public image <U+2013> such as not being seen smoking or drinking <U+2013> he was never told, "And you can't be gay".<ref name="20/20" /> Yet Bass said he knew that coming out would hurt the band's sales. "If you can't have a beer in your hand <U+2013> if that's going to make thousands of girls not buy your album <U+2013> then being gay definitely is going to make girls not buy your album."<ref name="20/20" /> Despite these fears, Bass revealed in an August 2007 interview with ''[[The New York Daily News]]'' that his female fanbase "exploded" when he [[came out]].<ref name="Fanbase">{{cite web |author=Giltz, Michael | date = [[August 12]] [[2007]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/culture/2007/08/12/2007-08-12_lance_bass_spikes_up_hairspray-1.html

===Public response===
Bass's announcement received a large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving "overwhelming support" from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync.<ref name="Reactions">{{cite web|author=Orzeck, Kurt. |date=[[July 6]],

In recent months, this term was applied to actors [[T.R. Knight]] and [[Neil Patrick Harris]] after they faced similar media scrutiny regarding their sexualities. The catchphrase was coined by Bass's [[Ex (relationship)|ex-boyfriend]], [[Reichen Lehmkuhl]].<ref name="Lanced">{{cite web| author=Associated Press. |date = [[November 7]], [[2006]] | url =http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=2634815&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312/| title =Lehmkuhl Says Harris Was "Lanced"| publisher =ABC News| accessdate =2006-11-07}}</ref> 

Bass received heat from the gay community when certain statements that he made in his ''People'' interview offended some activists. In the interview, Bass referred to himself and his friends as [[straight acting]]. "I call them the SAGs <U+2014> the straight-acting gays," Bass said. "We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer."<ref name="Mother" /> This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded [[stereotype]]s.<ref name="Reactions" /><ref>{{cite web

I don<U+2019>t know the phrases to say, and everything that I say is going to be taken wrong...

I was trying to say that there are so many types of gay people, just like there are so many types of straight people. And that just didn<U+2019>t read well.

On [[October 6]], [[2006]], the [[Human Rights Campaign]] awarded Bass its 2006 Visibility Award.<ref name="halloffame" /> The decision was met with heavy criticism from certain HRC sponsors, who claimed that Bass had not done enough to deserve the award.<ref name="Award 1">{{cite web|title = Are Lance Bass and Reichen Lehmkuhl Award-Worthy?|publisher = AOL News| date = [[September 18]] [[2006]]|url =http://journals.aol.com/gayesteditorever/WorthRepeating/entries/2006/09/18/are-lance-bass-and-reichen-lehmkuhl-award-worthy/407|accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> One journalist at [[The Washington Blade]] threatened to walk out when Bass received the award, "in a quiet form of protest".<ref name="Award 2">{{cite web|title = Bye!

In early 2006, Bass entered a relationship with ''[[Amazing Race]]'' winner [[Reichen Lehmkuhl]], which quickly became high-profile after Bass [[came out]] in July of that year.
