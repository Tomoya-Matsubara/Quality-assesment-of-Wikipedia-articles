"'''Is God Dead?'''" was an April 8, 1966, cover story for the news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. A previous article, from October 1965, had investigated a trend among 1960s theologians to write [[God]] out of the field of [[theology]]. The 1966 article looked in greater depth at the problems facing modern theologians, in making God relevant to an increasingly secular society. Modern science had eliminated the need for religion to explain the natural world, and God took up less and less space in people's daily lives. The ideas of various scholars were brought in, including the application of contemporary philosophy to the field of theology, and a more personal, individual approach to religion.

The issue drew heavy criticism, both from the broader public and clergymen. Much of the criticism was directed at the provocative magazine cover, rather than the content of the article. The cover{{ndash}} all black with the words "Is God Dead?" in large red types{{ndash}} marked the first time in the magazine's history that types with no accompanying image was used. In 2008, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the "Is God Dead?" issue among "10 magazine covers that shook the world".

==Background==
In 1966, [[Otto Fuerbringer]] had been editor of the news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' for six years.<ref name="Schudel">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080100146.html|title=Otto Fuerbringer; Time Editor in 1960s Helped Start Money, People Magazines|last=Schudel|first=Matt|date=2008-08-01|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> He helped to increase the circulation of the magazine, partly by changing its rather austere image. Though a conservative himself, he made the magazine focus extensively on the counter-culture and the political and intellectual radicalism of the 1960s.<ref name="Hevesi">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/us/30fuerbringer.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/T/Time%20Inc.|title=Otto Fuerbringer, Former Time Editor, Dies at 97|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|date=2008-07-30|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> A best-selling 1964 issue, for instance, had dealt with the [[sexual revolution]].<ref name="Hevesi"/> Already in October 1965 the magazine had published an article on the new radical theological movement.<ref name="Gray">{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-861|title="God Is Dead" Controversy|last=Gray|first=Patrick|date=2003-04-01|publisher=Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>

The April 8, 1966, cover of ''Time'' magazine was the first cover in the magazine's history to feature only type, and no photo.<ref name="10 covers">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-10magazinecovers14-july14-pg,0,5472017.photogallery?index=7|title=10 magazine covers that shook the world|date=2008-07|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> The cover{{ndash}} with the traditional, red border{{ndash}} was all black, with the words "Is God Dead?" in large, red types. The question was a reference to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s much-quoted postulate "[[God is dead]]" ([[German language|German]]: "''Gott ist tot''"),<ref name="Hidden God">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835309,00.html|title=Toward a Hidden God|last=|first=|date=1966-04-08|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> which he first proposed in his 1882 book ''[[The Gay Science]]''.

==Themes presented by the article==
===The problems===
The article accompanying the magazine cover, titled "Toward a Hidden God", mentioned only briefly in the introduction the so-called "God Is Dead" movement. In a footnote it identified the leaders of the movement as "[[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] of [[Emory University]], [[William Hamilton (theologian)|William Hamilton]] of [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School|Colgate Rochester Divinity School]], and [[Paul Van Buren]] of [[Temple University]]", and explained how these theologians had been trying to construct a theology without God. This theme had already been dealt with in greater detail in the shorter and less prominent article "The "God Is Dead" Movement", on October 22, 1965.<ref name="God Is Dead">This article also mentioned [[Gabriel Vahanian]] of [[Syracuse University]], in addition to the three men named above; {{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941410,00.html|title=The "God Is Dead" Movement|last=|first=|date=1965-10-22|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref>
{{Quote|Nietzsche's thesis was that striving, self-centered man had killed God, and that settled that. The current death-of-God group believes that God is indeed absolutely dead, but proposes to carry on and write a theology without theos, without God.|''Toward a Hidden God''}}

The article pointed out that while this movement had roots in the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], it also drew on a broader range of thinkers. For example, philosophers and theologians like [[S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard]] and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] expressed concerns about the role of God in an increasingly secularised world. The immediate reality did not indicate a death of God or religion; [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[Second Vatican Council]] had done much to revitalize the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while in the United States, as many as 97% declared a belief in God. Evangelical ministers such as [[Billy Graham]] and Christian artists like the playwright [[William Alfred]] could be brought as witness to the continued vitality of the Christian church. Nevertheless, this religiosity was mostly skin-deep; only 27% of Americans called themselves deeply religious.

The article then went on to explain the history of [[monotheism]], culminating in the omnipresent Catholic church of the [[Europe]]an [[Middle Ages]]. This zenith, however, was, according to the article, the beginning of the demise of Christianity: as society became increasingly secularised, the religious sphere of society became marginalised. Scientific discovery, from the [[Copernican Revolution]] to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], eliminated much of the need for religious explanations to life. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes|Descartes]] were perhaps personally devout men, but their discoveries "explained much of nature that previously seemed godly mysteries."

===Possible solutions===
Having laid out the philosophical and hisorical background, the article then asserted that there was still much curiosity among the general population about God and his relation to the world, and that for the modern theologian who wished to address this curiosity, there seemed to be four options:

{{quote|"stop talking about God for awhile, stick to what the Bible says, formulate a new image and concept of God using contemporary thought categories, or simply point the way to areas of human experience that indicate the presence of something beyond man in life."}}

According to the article, some contemporary ministers and theologians chose to focus on the life and teachings of [[Jesus]], rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran dangerously close to ethical [[humanism]]. [[Biblical literalism]], on the other hand, might have had an appeal to the fervent believer, but did not speak to most people in a world where the language of the [[Bible]] was increasingly unfamiliar.

The article described other attempts that had been made to solve to the problems of religion, including the adaptation of contemporary philosophical terminology to explain God, and cited efforts made to adapt the writings of [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] to modern theology. At the same time it noted that [[Ian Ramsey]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] had spoken of so-called "discernment situations"; situations in life that led man to question his own existence and purpose, and turn towards a greater power. The article concluded that the current crisis of faith could be healthy for the church, and that it might force clergymen and theologians to abandon previously held certainties: "The church might well need to take a position of reverent agnosticism regarding some doctrines that it had previously proclaimed with excessive conviction."<ref name="Hidden God"/>

The publication of the article immediately led to a public backlash. Editorial pages of newspapers received numerous letters from angry readers, and clergymen vehemently protested the content of the article.<ref name="Gray"/> Even though the article itself explored the theological and philosophical issues in depth, "[m]any people...were too quick to judge the magazine by its cover and denounced ''Time'' as a haven of godlessness".<ref name="Schudel2">{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postmortem/2008/07/is_god_dead.html|title=Is God Dead?

The magazine cover also entered the realm of popular culture: in a scene from the 1968 horror movie ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', the protagonist Rosemary Woodhouse picks up the issue in a doctor's waiting room.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rothman|first=William|coauthors= Stanley Cavell, Marian Keane|title=Reading Cavell's The World Viewed|work=Wayne State University Press|date=2000|pages=157|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j5W4H--kicoC|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> The "Is God Dead?" issue was to have an enduring place in American journalism.
