{{For|other uses|Intermountain (disambiguation)}}
The '''Intermountain West''' is a region of [[North America]] lying between the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the east and the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to the west.  It is also called the '''Intermountain Region'''.

== Topography ==
Many of the Intermountain Region's [[mountains]]' [[streams]] and [[rivers]] never reach the sea. Instead they flow into brackish lakes or into [[desert]] sinks. Only some rivers are able to reach the [[ocean]]. Some portions are made productive by [[irrigation systems]]. [[Cattle ranching]] is another process used.

== Climate ==
The [[climate]] of the Intermountain Region is affected by location and elevation. The winters depend on location. In the southern parts, the winters are short, warm, and have little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. In the northern portions, the winters are cold and moist, with hot and dry summers. This portion lacks precipitation as well, but the [[weather]] is moderate.

== Vegetation ==
The vegetation ranges from sparse [[grassland]]s and [[sagebrush]] to other plants that are able to survive in desert or semi-desert conditions in basin-lands. Some higher elevation areas have isolated stands of [[pine]], [[Cedar wood|cedar]], and [[aspen tree]] [[forests]]. Cultivated [[crops]] include [[Maize|corn]], [[potatoes]], [[sugar beets]], [[grass hay]], and [[alfalfa]]. The latter two crops are used for livestock feed.

== Demographics and sociology ==
A large portion of the Intermountain West is most associated with [[Latter-day Saint]] (LDS) settlements, and the region now has the highest ratio of LDS members in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |last= Kilpinen |first= Jon T |title= Latter-Day Saints as a Percentage of all Residence, 2000 |url= http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/mormon.gif |work= American Ethnic Geography |publisher= [[Valparaiso University]] }}</ref> That particular portion of the Intermountain West is sometimes called the [[Mormon Corridor]].

Because of its low population density and diverse economy, the [[survivalist]] writers [[James Wesley Rawles]]<ref>[http://www.survivalblog.com/retreatareas.html SurvivalBlog.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Joel Skousen]]<ref name=skousen>[http://www.joelskousen.com/About/about.html About Joel Skousen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> both recommend the region as a preferred locale for "strategic relocation"<ref name=skousen/> and for building [[survival retreat]]s.

== Intermountain states ==
The '''intermountain states''' are generally considered to be the area of [[Idaho]] south of the Salmon River,  [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], as well as the area of [[Arizona]] north of the Colorado River.<ref name="The Intermountain West">
{{cite book |title=The Intermountain West: A Story of Place and People |last=Blake |first=Reed  |year=2002 |publisher=Pearson Custom Publishing  |isbn=0-536-66915-5}}</ref> The intermountain states are so named because they lie between (or at least amidst) the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]].  Large areas of these states are less mountainous than typical of the Rocky Mountain region.  The intermountain states are included among those states considered as the [[Mountain States]].
