== History  ==
=== Founding  ===

Beginning July 19, 1855, Charles A. Colton opened the "Pittsburgh Dollar Savings Institution"<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline">dollarbank.com: About / [http://www.dollarbank.com/about/timeline.aspx Timeline]</ref>. The first day's deposits totaled $53<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. On September 4, 1858, Pittsburgh Dollar Savings Institution was renamed "The Dollar Savings Bank."<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />

=== First Office  ===

The Dollar Savings Bank<U+2019>s Fourth Avenue Building was opened in March 1871<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" /> and is still in operation today. The architect was Isaac H. Hobbs &amp; Sons of [[Philadelphia]]. The building was constructed using 1,400 tons of brownstone, quarried in [[Connecticut]], pink Quincy [[Granite]] and significant amounts of [[Marble]] and [[Brass]]. 

In 1871, two stone lions were placed at the front door of the Fourth Avenue Building, as symbols of guardianship of the people<U+2019>s money<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. The stately lions guarding the entrance were sculpted by [[Max Kohler]]<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />, each from a single block of quarry-bedded brownstone. A project to restore the lions began in September 2009<ref>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]: [http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/pittsburgh/s_642883.html Downtown Dollar Bank's lions leave 138-year perch] 2009-09-13.

Page 13. Retrieved 2009-20-21.</ref>. 

The Board Room was added to The Dollar Savings Bank<U+2019>s Fourth Avenue Building in 1896 at a cost of $37,981<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. 

In 1906, the East and West wings were added to The Dollar Savings Bank<U+2019>s Fourth Avenue Building<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />.

=== The Great Depression  ===

During the 1930s, the main lobby was redecorated<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. Lighting fixtures were replaced, the teller counter altered and the interior repainted. 

In 1931, $1 million in cash was brought to the bank office floor to prove the availability of customers' funds during the depression<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. During this difficult economic time, The Dollar Savings Bank never closed<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. On November 1, 1949, The Dollar Savings Bank had [[assets]] at [[book value]] of over $100 million<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. In 1938, the original vault in The Dollar Savings Bank<U+2019>s Fourth Avenue Building was relocated to the basement of the building to make room for the Trustee Boards Anteroom<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. 

The vault was installed after the [[Pittsburgh Flood of 1936|St. Patrick<U+2019>s Day Flood of 1936]], which devastated downtown Pittsburgh. The Dollar Savings Bank wanted a new vault that was not only fireproof but also flood-proof.

=== Expansion  ===
[[File:DollarBank footprint.png|thumb|right|250px|Current Dollar Bank branch footprint in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio.]]

The Dollar Savings Bank bought the Boyd Building in February 1950<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. The bank used the first two floors of the space and the rest of the building was leased<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. 

In 1956, The Dollar Savings Bank purchased the DeRoy Building and converted the first floor for bank use, expanding the Fourth Avenue Building footprint<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. This building was demolished in 1970 and the space became a pedestrian plaza. 

In the 1960s, Fourth Avenue Building<U+2019>s cupola skylights were filled in, the interior was repainted and the teller counter was altered to make it one level surface<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />.

=== Early Technology  ===

The Dollar Savings Bank opened its first branch office on June 29, 1961 in the Oliver Building and entered the [[computer age]] with its first online electronic bank accounting system in Pennsylvania and one of the first ten in the [[United States]] on November 30, 1964<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. 

In 1976, The Dollar Savings Bank introduced pay-by-phone as the first bill payment system of its kind in Pennsylvania and second in the United States<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. The Dollar Savings Bank reached $1 billion in assets and on July 14 of that year The Dollar Savings Bank's Fourth Avenue Office was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. 

The Dollar Savings Bank installed its first [[Automated teller machine]] (ATM) in 1977<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" /> and in 1978 free retail checking accounts, called "NOW accounts", were offered for the first time<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. In July 1981, The Dollar Savings Bank began to offer accounts and services tailored to the needs of businesses<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />.

=== Market Expansion  ===

On September 20, 1984, The Dollar Savings Bank acquired Continental Federal Savings and Loan Bank and offered banking services to the [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] area<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. In a deal brokered by the [[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation]], The Dollar Savings Bank acquired the troubled Cleveland-based thrift and within two years, a combination of government guarantees against losses and new investment returned Continental to profitability. That same year, Continental's name was changed to Dollar Bank and The Dollar Savings Bank was renamed to "Dollar Bank"<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. Dollar Bank began offering [[term loan]]s, lines of credit and [[Credit cards]] in 1986<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. 

The first Dollar Bank Loan Center was opened in [[Murrysville, Pennsylvania|Murrysville]], Pennsylvania on January 18, 1994<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. Dollar Bank's "Win-Win Home Equity Adjustable Rate Loan" was launched as the first loan of its kind in March 1994<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. Dollar Bank became the 16th bank in the country to offer [[online banking]] via the [[Internet]] in March 1997<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. Dollar Bank initiates the "Freedom ATM Alliance" surcharge free network, a group of 29 banks that joined together on January 4, 1999<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />. The goal of the Alliance is to provide surcharge-free ATM alternatives to customers. Banks entering the Alliance agree not to surcharge the customers of any other Alliance member at their ATMs.

On April 6, 1998, the Dollar Bank online banking service was inducted into the 1998 Computerworld Smithsonian Innovation Collection<ref name="dollarbank.com Timeline" />.
