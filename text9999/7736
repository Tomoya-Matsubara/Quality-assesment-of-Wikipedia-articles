''' Henry Spencer Moore''' [[Order of Merit|OM]] [[Companion of Honour|CH]] [[Federation of British Artists|FBA]] (30 July 1898 <U+2013> 31 August 1986) was an English artist and [[Sculpture|sculptor]]. He is best known for his [[abstract art|abstract]] monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as [[Public art|public works of art]]. 

His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, [[Yorkshire]].

Moore was born in [[Castleford]], the son of a mining engineer. He became well-known through his larger-scale abstract cast bronze and carved marble sculptures, and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of [[modernism]] to the United Kingdom. His later life ability to satisfy large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy. Yet he lived frugally and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the [[Henry Moore Foundation]], which continues to support education and promotion of the arts.<ref>"[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=418 Chronology]".

==Early life==

Moore was born in [[Castleford]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father had immigrated from Ireland and was a mining engineer who rose to be under-manager of the Wheldale [[Coal mining|colliery]] in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature.  Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement.<ref name "G15">Grohmann, 16.</ref> Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in [[clay]] and [[wood carving|carving in wood]]. He decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of [[Michelangelo]]'s achievements. 

The same year a teacher noticed his talent and interest in [[Gothic art|medieval sculpture]] and granted him a scholarship to [[Castleford High School Technology and Sports College|Castleford Secondary School]],<ref>Grohmann, 15.</ref> which several of his siblings had attended. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement he determined to make art his career, first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. 

Despite his early promise, Moore's parents were against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore was called to the army. He was the youngest man in the [[Prince of Wales's Own Civil Service Rifles]] regiment, and was injured in 1917 in a [[Chemical warfare|gas attack]] during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].<ref>Moore, Henry; Beckett, Jane; Russell, Fiona. "Henry Moore". Ashgate, 2003. ISBN 0-7546-0836-0</ref> After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a [[physical fitness|physical training]] instructor. In stark contrast to many of his contemporaries, Moore's wartime experience was largely untroubled. He recalled later, "for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero."<ref>Wilkinson, Alan G. "Henry Moore: Writings and Conversations". University of California Press, 2002. 41. ISBN 0-5202-3161-9</ref>

==Beginnings as a sculptor==

After the war, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education, and in 1919 he became the first student of sculpture at the [[Leeds College of Art and Design]], which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met [[Barbara Hepworth]]<U+2014>a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor<U+2014>and began a friendship that lasted for many years. Moore had access to many works owned by Sir [[Michael Ernest Sadler|Michael Sadler]], the University [[Vice-Chancellor]].<ref>"[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?artist_id=4071&section_id=T059426 Henry Moore]". [[Museum of Modern Art]], 2007. Retrieved on 16 August, 2008.</ref> In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the [[Royal College of Art]] in London, where his friend Hepworth had gone the year before. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of [[primitivism|primitive art]] and sculpture, studying the [[ethnographic]] collections at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[British Museum]].

[[Image:Chac Mool1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Chac Mool]] stone statue at [[Chichen Itza]] site, [[Yucatan Peninsula]], Mexico. This reclining [[Toltec]]-[[Maya civilization|Maya]] figure influenced Moore's sculpture.]]

The early sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth follow the standard romantic [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] style, and include natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as [[Constantin Brancusi]], [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Frank Dobson (sculptor)|Frank Dobson]] led him to the method of [[Glossary of sculpting|direct carving]], in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who lacked appreciation of such a modern approach. During one exercise set by [[Francis Derwent Wood|Derwent Wood]] (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble [[relief]] of [[Domenico Rosselli]]'s ''The Virgin and Child''<ref>Allemand-Cosneau, Claude; Fath, Manfred, Mitchinson, David. "Henry Moore". Nantes: Mus'ee des Beaux Arts, 1996. 63. ISBN 3-7913-1662-1</ref> by first modelling the relief in [[plaster]], then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical technique of "pointing". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine. 

In 1924, Moore won a six-month traveling scholarship which he spent in [[Northern Italy]] studying the great works of [[Michelangelo]], [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Giovanni Pisano]] and several other [[Old Masters]]. During this period he also visited Paris, took advantage of the timed-sketching classes at the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie Colarossi]], and viewed, in the [[Louvre]], a plaster cast of a [[Toltec]]-[[Maya civilization|Maya]] sculptural form, the [[Chac Mool]]. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.<ref>"[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=383 Henry Moore: Biography 1916-1925]".

==Hampstead==

On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, ''West Wind'' (1928<U+2013>29), was one of the eight 'winds' reliefs high on the walls of [[London Underground]]'s headquarters at [[55 Broadway, London|55 Broadway]].<ref>Cork, Richard. "Art Beyond the Gallery in Early 20th Century England: In Early 20th Century England". Yale University Press, 1985. 249. ISBN 0-3000-3236-6</ref> The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including [[Eric Gill]]. In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in [[Kiev]] in 1907 to Russian<U+2013>Polish parents. Her father did not return from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in [[Buckinghamshire]]. 

[[Image:HenryMoore WestWind.jpg|thumb|''West Wind'', 1928<U+2013>29; Moore's first public commission was carved from [[Portland stone]] and shows the influence of  [[Michelangelo]]'s figures for the [[Medici Chapel]] and the [[Chac Mool]] figure.]]

Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in [[Hampstead]] on Parkhill Road, joining a small colony of [[avant-garde]] artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her partner [[Ben Nicholson]] moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while [[Naum Gabo]], [[Roland Penrose]] and the art critic [[Herbert Read]] also lived in the area.<ref>Read, Herbert. [http://www.modernism101.com/read_henry_moore.php Henry Moore sculptor]. ''Modernism 101''. Retrieved on 22 September, 2008.</ref> This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicize, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America<U+2014>many of whom would later commission works from Moore. 

In 1932, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the [[Chelsea School of Art]].<ref>Grohmann, 30.</ref> Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of the The [[Seven and Five Society]] would develop steadily more abstract work,<ref>"[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=270 Seven and Five Society]". [[Tate Britain]]. Retrieved on 04 September, 2008.</ref> partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[George Braque]], [[Jean Arp]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]]. Moore flirted with [[Surrealism]], joining [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]'s [[modern art]] movement, the "Unit One Group", in 1933. Moore and Nash were on the organizing committee of the London International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary [[maquette]]s in clay or plaster. 

This inventive and productive period was brought to an end by the outbreak of the Second World War. The Chelsea School of Art evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post. During the war, Moore was commissioned as a war artist, notably producing powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from the blitz.<ref>"[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue2/moore.htm Insight at end of the Tunnel]" [[Tate Modern]]. Retrieved on 16 August, 2008.</ref> These drawings helped to boost Moore's international reputation, particularly in America. After their Hampstead home was hit by bomb shrapnel in 1940, he and Irina moved out of London to live in a farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of [[Perry Green]] near [[Much Hadham]], [[Hertfordshire]]. This was to become Moore's final home and workshop. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to a larger home and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and workshops, the house changed little.

After the war and following several earlier miscarriages, Irina gave birth to their daughter, Mary Moore, in March 1946.<ref>Kuskov, Sergei. "Henry Moore". Praeger, 1973. 83. ISBN 0-8758-7054-6</ref> The child was named after Moore's mother, who had died a few years earlier. Both the loss of his mother and the arrival of a baby focused Moore's mind on the family, which he expressed in his work by producing many "mother-and-child" compositions, although reclining figures also remained popular. In the same year, Moore made his first visit to America when a retrospective exhibition of his work opened at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City.<ref>Beckett et al, 96.</ref> [[Kenneth Clark]] became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work,<ref>Beckett et al, 6.</ref> and through his position as member of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist.

Toward the end of the war, Moore had been approached by educator [[Henry Morris (education)|Henry Morris]], who was trying to reform education with his concept of the [[Village College]]. Morris had engaged [[Walter Gropius]] as the architect for his second village college at [[Impington Village College|Impington]] near [[Cambridge]], and he wanted Moore to design a major public sculpture for the site. The County Council, however, could not afford Gropius's full design, and scaled back the project when Gropius emigrated to America. Lacking funds, Morris had to cancel Moore's sculpture, which had not progressed beyond the maquette stage.<ref>"[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&pos=8&intObjectID=5075572&sid= Lot 9, Sale 1994: Family Group]".

This time, the project was completed and ''Family Group'' became Moore's first large-scale public bronze.

In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including a reclining figure<ref>"[http://www.unesco.org/artcollection/DetailAction.do?&idOeuvre=1547&nouvelleLangue=en Moore, Henry]". [[UNESCO]]. Retrieved on 16 August, 2008.</ref> for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris in 1957. With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore's sculptures grew significantly and he started to employ a number of assistants to work with him at Much Hadham, including [[Anthony Caro]]<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/caro/chronology.htm Anthony Caro].

The last three decades of Moore's life continued in a similar vein; several major retrospectives took place around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 on the grounds of the [[Belvedere (fort)|Forte di Belvedere]] overlooking [[Florence]]. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed ''Knife Edge <U+2013> Two Piece'' in 1962 for [[College Green (London)|College Green]] near the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London. According to Moore, "When I was offered the site near the [[House of Lords]]&nbsp;<U+2026> I liked the place so much that I didn't bother to go and see an alternative site in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] <U+2014> one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park.

As his wealth grew, Moore began to worry about his legacy. With the help of his daughter Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|death duties]]. By 1977, he was paying close to a million pounds a year in [[income tax]]; to mitigate his tax burden, he established the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to promote the public appreciation of art and to preserve Moore's sculptures. It now runs Moore's final home, Hoglands, as a gallery and museum of Moore's workshops.<ref>Kennedy, Maev.

Moore turned down a [[Knight|knighthood]] in 1951 because he felt that the bestowal would lead to a perception of him as an establishment figure and that "such a title might tend to cut me off from fellow artists whose work has aims similar to mine".<ref>"[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue6/moore.htm The Bronze Age]".

The aftermath of [[World War II]], [[The Holocaust]], and the age of the atomic bomb instilled in the sculpture of the mid-1940s a sense that art should return to its pre-cultural and pre-rational origins. In the literature of the day, writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] advocated a similar reductive philosophy.<ref name="C34">Causey, 34.</ref> At an introductory speech in New York City for an exhibition of one of the finest [[Modernism|modernist]] sculptors, [[Alberto Giacometti]], Sartre spoke of "The beginning and the end of history".<ref>Morris, Frances.

[[Image:Stuttgart-henry-moore-liegende.jpg|thumb|left|Moore's bronze "Die Liegende" (located in Stuttgart) is typical of his early reclining figures.]]

Moore's signature form is a reclining figure. Moore's exploration of this form, under the influence of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings. 

Earlier figures are pierced in a conventional manner, in which bent limbs separate from and rejoin the body. The later, more abstract figures are often penetrated by spaces directly through the body, by which means Moore explores and alternates concave and convex shapes. These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with [[Barbara Hepworth]]'s sculptures.<ref>"[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue5/hepworth.htm The Hole of Life]". ''Tate Magazine'', Issue 5, Autumn 2005. Retrieved on 06 September, 2008.</ref> Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore's early shows. The painted plaster ''Reclining Figure'' (1951) outside the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]], is characteristic of Moore's later sculptures: an abstract female figure intercut with voids. There are several bronze versions of this sculpture. When Moore's niece asked why his sculptures had such simple titles, he replied, "All art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator. Giving a sculpture or a drawing too explicit a title takes away part of that mystery so that the spectator moves on to the next object, making no effort to ponder the meaning of what he has just seen. Everyone thinks that he or she looks but they don't really, you know."<ref>Day, Elizabeth. "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/jul/27/1 The Moore legacy]". ''The Observer'', 27 July 2008.

Moore's early work is focused on [[Glossary of sculpting#direct carving|direct carving]], in which the form of the sculpture evolves as the artist repeatedly whittles away at the block. In the 1930s, Moore's transition into [[modernism]] paralleled that of Barbara Hepworth; the two exchanged new ideas with each other and several other artists then living in Hampstead. Moore made many preparatory [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] and drawings for each sculpture. Most of these sketchbooks have survived and provide insight into Moore's development. He placed great importance on drawing; even when he had arthritis, he still was able to draw.<ref>McCave, Lesley. "[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25417/la-graphic/ LA Graphic]".  ARTINFO, 31 July, 2007. Retrieved on 16 August, 2008.</ref>

After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took on their larger scale, which was particularly suited for public art commissions. As a matter of practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce maquettes. By the end of the 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] technique. At his home in Much Hadham, Moore built up a collection of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he often produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final [[Molding (process)|moulding]] and [[casting]] at a bronze [[foundry]]. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added surface marks before casting.<ref>"[http://www.barth.lib.in.us/LargeArch.html Large Arch]". Bartholomew County Public Library.

[[Image:Rotterdam kunstwerk Wall Relief no.1.jpg|left|250px|thumb|"Wall Relief no. 1", Bouwcentrum in Rotterdam, 1955]]

Moore produced at least three significant examples of architectural sculpture during his career.  In 1928, despite his own self-described "extreme reservations", he accepted his first public commission for ''West Wind'' for the [[London Underground]] Building at [[55 Broadway]] in London, joining the company of [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Eric Gill]].  In 1952, he completed a four-part concrete screen for the Time-Life Building in New Bond Street, London, and in 1955 Moore turned to his first and only work in carved brick, "Wall Relief no. 1" at the Bouwcentrum in Rotterdam.  The brick relief was sculptured with 16,000 bricks by two Dutch bricklayers.

==Legacy==

Most sculptors who emerged during the height of Moore's fame, and in the aftermath of his death, found themselves cast in his shadow. By the late 1930s, Moore was a worldwide celebrity; he was the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general. The next generation was constantly compared against him, and reacted by challenging his legacy, his "establishment" and his position. At the 1952 [[Venice Biennale]], eight new British sculptors produced their ''Geometry of Fear'' works as a direct contrast to the ideals behind Moore's idea of ''Endurance, Continuity''.<ref>Causey, 71.</ref>

[[Herbert Read]] coined the phrase for these "Young British Sculptors" when he wrote of the Biennale, "Here are images of flight, of ragged claws 'scuttling across the floors of silent seas', of excoriated flesh, frustrated sex, the geometry of fear."<ref>Turner, Chris. "[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue6/moore.htm Henry Moore]", ''Tate Magazine'', issue 6, July/August 2003. Retrieved on 12 September, 2008.</ref> The works alluded to rib and cage forms, insect shapes, and to aggression and predation. Read drew a direct connection and continuity between these new sculptors<U+2014>all were under 40<U+2014>and Moore, but in fact they were driven by a need to find a new beginning in art. Some had no formal artistic education, and, coming from a generation decimated by the war, only sought to be rid of the past.<ref>Causey, 72.</ref>

Yet Moore had a direct influence on several generations of sculptors of both British and international reputation. Among the artists who have acknowledged Moore's importance to their work are [[Sir Anthony Caro]],<ref>[http://www.anthonycaro.org/frames-related/biography.htm Caro biography]. anthonycaro.org.

Other artists whose work was influenced by him include [[Lynn Chadwick]], [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Bernard Meadows]], [[Reg Butler]], William Turnbull, Robert Adams, Kenneth Armitage, and Geoffrey Clarke.<ref name="Tate">"[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue6/moore.htm The Bronze Age]".

Today, the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] manages the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds which supports exhibitions and research activities in international sculpture. By the Foundation's own admission, popular interest in Moore's work has declined since his death, yet the institutions he endowed continue to play an essential role in promoting contemporary art in the United Kingdom.<ref>"[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=33 Unfinished Business: Mark Wilsher on view from 26th July]".
