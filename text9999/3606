The '''Combine''', abbreviated as '''CMB''' and referred to as "'''Our Benefactors'''", is a [[multiverse|multidimensional]] empire which serves as the primary [[antagonist]]ic force in the  [[video game]] ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', developed by [[Valve Corporation]]. The Combine consist of alien, synthetic, and human elements, and dominate Earth. They are regularly encountered throughout ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' and its [[Episodic game|episodic]] expansions as hostile [[non-player character]]s as the player progresses through the games in an effort to overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth.

The Combine are frequently shown as harsh rulers over the citizens of Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, [[Police brutality|policing using violence]] and using [[invasive surgery]] to [[Transhuman|transform humans]] into either soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles with transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that are the product of Combine technology. The atmosphere generated by the [[dystopia]]n Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the [[game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] of the [[transhuman]] Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in ''Half-Life 2''. In addition to their role within the ''Half-Life'' series, the Combine have been adapted for [[machinima]] productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.

Some elements of the Combine's appearance, such as that of the Advisor, are inspired by the works of [[Frank Herbert]].<ref name="raising the bar">{{cite book|title=[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|first=David|last=Hodgson|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7615-4364-0}}</ref> The name "Combine" itself is a tribute to [[Ken Kesey|Ken Kesey's]] novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', which features a collection of authorities which mechanistically manipulate and process individuals.<ref name="raising the bar"/> 

During ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s development, various concepts for Combine non-player characters were created and later cut. Female Combine assassins, similar to [[black operations]] assassins featured in the first game, were planned but later abandoned, although they appear in the ''[[Half-Life 2: Survivor]]'' arcade game.<ref name="raising the bar"/> Another non-player character, the cremator, was conceptualized as a Combine laborer who cleaned the streets of bodies after a battle with an acid gun and although removed from the game, its head was featured in [[Eli Vance|Eli Vance's]] laboratory.

===Society===
Little is revealed of the Combine's role outside of Earth, but dialogue in ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' states that they control worlds in different dimensions and inhabited by a range of species.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Dark Energy| quote='''Wallace Breen''': Carbon stars with ancient satellites, colonized by sentient fungi; gas giants, inhabited by vast meteorological intelligences; worlds stretched thin across the membranes where the dimensions intersect...impossible to describe with our limited vocabulary!}}</ref> The Combine occupation of Earth, however, is shown to be a brutal [[police state]]. In [[City 17]], a generic [[Eastern Europe]]an city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging in random [[police brutality]]. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Point Insertion| quote='''Citizen''': No matter how many times I get relocated, I...never get used to it.}}</ref> [[Vortigaunt]]s, alien creatures from the original ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to ''[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]'', the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds;<ref name="raising the bar"/> both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.<ref>[http://www.visualwalkthroughs.com/halflife2/highway17/highway17.htm Highway 17]</ref>

At the heart of the Combine's command structure in ''Half-Life 2'' is the Citadel, an enormous, monolithic structure of Combine construction, reaching approximately 2.6 kilometres (1.6 miles) into the sky from ground level,<ref>[http://www.geekosystem.com/half-life-2-citadel-height/ Half-Life 2 Citadel Height]</ref> and delving deep underground. Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, [[Wallace Breen]]. Breen is frequently seen on large screens around the city from which he spreads [[propaganda]]. The Citadel projects an energy field that is able to prevent human reproduction,<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2006| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Urban Flight| quote='''Isaac Kleiner''': I feel obliged to point out that a more fortunate side effect of the reactor's destruction is the complete removal of the Combine's reproductive suppression field. Previously, certain protein chains important to the process of embryonic development were selectively prevented from forming; this is no longer the case.

The Combine's defense field must have collapsed.

It powers their tunneling entanglement device.}}</ref> The Citadel also contains construction facilities for various synthetic Combine combat machines.

===Depiction===
The Combine is composed of various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout ''Half-Life 2'' and its expansions are the Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. A variety of combat machines and "synths" are also encountered.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=3&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2'' Enemies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref>

====Advisors====
[[Image:Advisor (Half-Life).jpg|thumb|right|The Advisor's grub-like appearance was inspired by the works of science fiction author [[Frank Herbert]]]]
Advisors are large larvae-like creatures which are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, though they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms.<ref name="EP1enemies">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=17&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2: Episode One'' Enemies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible [[proboscis]]. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them.<ref name="EP1enemies"/><ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Half-Life 2]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation]]|date= 2004 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] | level= Dark Energy| quote='''Dr. Wallace Breen''': (to an Advisor) It's me you should be worried about! I can still deliver Earth, but not without your help! [..] The portal destination is untenable, surely you can set the relay else where. There's no way I can survive in that environment! A host body?! You must be joking, I can't possibly<U+2014>oh, all right, damn it, if that's what it takes. Just hurry, he's right behind me!}}</ref> Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess [[telekinesis|telekinetic powers]] with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference.<ref name="EP1enemies"/> Their appearance was based on the [[Guild Navigator]]s from the film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''.<ref>''[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]''</ref>

====Civil Protection====
Civil Protection is the Combine's [[Police|law enforcement]] agency on Earth, consisting of humans who have agreed to work on behalf of the Combine. Also referred to as metrocops, Civil Protection units wear light armor and gas masks. They are usually armed with [[Electroshock weapon|electroshock batons]] and [[pistol]]s, and are occasionally seen using [[submachine gun]]s. Metrocops are brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and physical force. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of extreme [[police brutality]] are all used as a means of policing their respective jurisdictions; their methods are justified by their role as "protectors of the civilians{{'}} well-being". On the outskirts of [[City 17]], Civil Protection units are observed patrolling for escapees from the city. Civil Protection officers are in constant contact with Combine Overwatch headquarters, which gives them objectives and situation updates. On the death of an officer, that officer's armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs headquarters of the fatality and advises nearby units as to the place of death.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/>

====Overwatch====
The Combine Overwatch is the primary military force of the Combine on Earth. It consists of [[Transhuman|biomechanically enhanced humans]], who wear heavily padded long-sleeve body armor and gas masks. The markings on the suit change depending on each individual unit's assignment and rank. Elite Combine soldiers wear bright white armor, while the majority of soldiers wear variations of blue or brown armor. They are armed with a variety of firearms, including [[shotgun]]s, submachine guns, [[sniper rifle]]s and [[pulse rifle]]s. Overwatch soldiers usually operate in small groups, using squad tactics and [[grenade]]s to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of [[Dropship (science fiction)|dropships]]. They use radios to communicate with each other and with Overwatch headquarters. Combine Overwatch soldiers are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city after a large uprising near the end of ''Half-Life 2''.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/>

====Combine technology====
The Combine use a large array of [[science fiction]] technology. They have access to [[teleportation]] technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by [[Eli Vance]], [[Isaac Kleiner]] and [[Judith Mossman]] in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Black Mesa East| quote='''Judith Mossman''': We're closing in on a reliable local teleport technology, something the Combine still hasn't mastered. Eli thinks their models are string-based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they fail to factor in the dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from their universe, but once they're here, they're dependent on local transportation.}}</ref> Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, known as "city scanners", to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/> Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause [[laceration]] injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of [[land mine]]s; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical "rollermines" roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/> Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.<ref name="EP1enemies"/><ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation]]| date=2006|level=Direct Intervention|quote='''Alyx Vance''': Goddamn the Combine! This is what happens to you if you resist... or if you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [..] God, I hope you don't remember who you are...}}</ref>

Militarily, the Combine make use of both synthetic machines<U+2014>machines powered by organic components<U+2014>and traditional mechanical machines such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s and [[attack helicopter]]s.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/> The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like [[gunship]]s; and Striders, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} armored creatures possessing three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/> In ''Episode Two'', a smaller equivalent to the Strider, the Hunter, is introduced. These 2.5&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the ''Half-Life 2'', although their roles are not elaborated on. [[Sentry gun|Sentry turrets]] are also used by the Combine.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/> The Combine also use [[headcrab]]s as a [[biological weapon]] against dissidents, firing specialized artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest the vicinity.<ref name="IGNHL2enemies"/>

[[Image:Combine soldiers.png|thumb|right|Two Overwatch soldiers in ''Episode Two'', with a Hunter in the background]]
According to the backstory presented during ''Half-Life 2'', the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the [[Nihilanth]], the [[Boss (video games)|boss character]] at the end of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] and the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in "portal storms" which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When it is sufficiently wide, the Combine invade in force, and in the subsequent Seven Hour War quickly defeat the forces of Earth and destroy the [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] in [[New York City]]. Earth's surrender is negotiated by [[Wallace Breen]], who is then made the Combine administrator of Earth, and uses [[City 17]] as his base of operations.<ref name="BME">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=16&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough<U+2014>Chapter 5: Black Mesa East|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

The Combine's first appearance is in ''Half-Life 2''. Through the early stages of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in ''Half-Life'', Breen sees Freeman as a major threat.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Wallace Breen''': We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who has acquired an almost messianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens. His figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct, ignorance and decay; some of the worst excesses of the Black Mesa incident have been laid directly at his feet. And yet unsophisticated minds continue to embue him with romantic power, giving him such dangerous poetic labels as the "One Free Man", the "Opener of the Way".}}</ref> As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of [[Black Mesa East]] and capture resistance leader [[Eli Vance]], who is transferred to holding facilities at [[Nova Prospekt]].<ref name="BME"/> Freeman and Vance's daughter [[Alyx Vance|Alyx]] break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent [[Judith Mossman]]. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start of a revolution by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=33&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough<U+2014>Chapter 10: Entanglement|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.

In ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]'', the destruction of the top of the Citadel has caused its primary reactor to begin to melt down, forcing Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance to journey back into the Citadel to temporarily stabilize it while the city's inhabitants are evacuated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=1&game=3

After Alyx acquires an encrypted copy of the data to be sent, Overwatch forces desperately attempt to stop the pair from escaping the city, spurred on by Combine Advisors. As the pair escape on a train at the end of the game, the Citadel sends the message and detonates, destroying City 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=5&game=3

''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]]'' opens with Alyx and Freeman discovering that the Citadel's destruction has resulted in the formation of a [[Portal (fiction)|super portal]] to the Combine dimension, which is slowly progressing to a stage where it can send overwhelming reinforcements.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2007| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = To The White Forest| quote='''Isaac Kleiner''': What you're seeing is the infancy of a superportal. If it retains full strength<U+2014> / '''Eli Vance''': It will be the Seven Hour War, all over again! Except this time we won't last seven minutes!}}</ref> They also discover that the data packet they retrieved from the Citadel contains codes that can be used to close the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to the resistance headquarters at [[White Forest]]. As they progress, it becomes evident that the Combine Advisors escaped the Citadel's destruction, and that remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under occasional attacks by [[Vortigaunt]]s.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2007| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Freeman Pontifex| quote='''Vortigaunt''': They carry ''Shu'ulathoi'': Advisors still in incubation pods.

However, in the game's closing scenes, two Advisors attack Freeman, Alyx and Eli Vance, and kill Eli before being driven off by Dog.

===Appearances in other media===
The use of sandbox applications like ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' have allowed for Combine [[non-player character]]s to be used in a variety of [[webcomic]]s and [[machinima]] productions. In one webcomic, ''[[Concerned]]'', the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon <!-- This is not a typo, don't change it -->Peeman<!-- This is not a typo, don't change it -->, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-07|title=Issue #62|work=[[Concerned|Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman]]|first=Christopher|last=Livingston|date=2005-10-07|accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref> In another example, the machinima series ''Combine Nation'' follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to [[police procedural]] documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with [[adhesive bandage]]s and the legal consultant, an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing [[flashbang]]s, which often backfire on him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litfusefilms.com/movies/combinenationepisode1/|title=''Combine Nation: Episode One''|publisher=Lit Fuse Films|accessdate=2008-09-19}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Another web series, called ''The Combine'', parodies the TV show ''[[The Office]]''.

===Reception===
The Combine have received a positive reaction from critics.
