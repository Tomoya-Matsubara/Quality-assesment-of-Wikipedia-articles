==Early and personal life==
David Norris was born in [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] in the [[Belgian Congo]], now known as [[Kinshasa]], capital of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], where his father (John Norris) worked as chief engineer for [[Lever Brothers]].<ref name="sundaytimes"/> John Norris served in the [[British Armed Forces]] during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]; he died while Norris was still a child. David Norris was then sent to Ireland to be cared for by his mother, Aida Fitzpatrick, and her extended family.<ref name="sundaytimes"/>

<blockquote>
<p>...while, on hearing his dad had died, he "had to squeeze out tears" because they were never that close, the death of his mother, was "totally heartbreaking".<p/>

<p>"It destroyed my sense of reality," he adds, now. "This was somebody I loved who was there one minute, then the next minute she was gone."<ref name="independent1">{{cite web|author=independent.ie apps |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/all-my-life-i-have-fought-against-being-labelled-and-against-stigma-2654239.html |title=All my life, I have fought against being labelled and against stigma |publisher=Independent.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref></p>
</blockquote>

After first meeting in 1975, Norris was in a long-term relationship with Israeli activist [[Ezra Nawi]] for a number of years until 1985.<ref>http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill1.jpg</ref> They continued a platonic friendship after that. In a Today FM interview with Matt Cooper in Summer 2011 Norris said (paraphrasing{{who|date=September 2011}}) "nowadays people think of a romantic relationship as a sexual one and Ezra and myself have not had that kind of relationship since the 1980s."

==Education and academic career==
Norris attended school at [[St. Andrew's College (Ireland)|St. Andrew's College]] and [[The High School, Dublin|The High School]]. He then entered [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], the [[University of Dublin]], to read for the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English Literature and Language, where he was elected a Foundation Scholar in that subject before achieving a 1st Class Moderatorship and editing ''[[Icarus (magazine)|Icarus]]'', the University literary magazine.  He remained at Trinity as a lecturer and college tutor between 1968 and 1996.<ref>http://www.senatordavidnorris.ie/1bio.htm</ref> His love of Joyce is borne out in Dublin's annual [[Bloomsday]] celebrations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/a-morning-for-the-stouthearted-by-jiminy-217446.html|title=A morning for the stout-hearted, by Jiminy|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=17 June 2003|quote=Beautiful, sinister, melodic, whispering," enthused Senator David Norris.

After contracting the waterborne variation of [[Hepatitis]] while visiting Central Europe in 1994, Norris received disability payments from a private income continuance insurer worth thousands of euro over 16 years.<ref name="David Norris: Hepatitis led to disability payments"/> Trinity College paid for this, and not the State.<ref name="Norris got TCD disability pay">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1005/breaking18.html?via=mr|title=Norris got TCD disability pay|accessdate=05 Oct 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/norris-received-disability-allowance-because-of-hepatitis-diagnosis-245877-Oct2011/|title=Norris received TCD disability pension because of Hepatitis diagnosis|accessdate=05 Oct 2011|quote=Norris stressed that he had not claimed a state allowance for his condition...}}</ref> Norris left his role as a lecturer after Trinity College authorities said the situation arising from his illness was "untenable", although he remained an elected senator.<ref name="David Norris: Hepatitis led to disability payments"/> Norris was hospitalised and was seriously ill for a time as a result of the condition.<ref name="David Norris: Hepatitis led to disability payments">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/presidential-election/david-norris-hepatitis-led-to-disability-payments-2896873.html|title=David Norris: Hepatitis led to disability payments|accessdate=05 Oct 2011}}</ref> He has rarely drunk alcohol since the diagnosis.<ref name="Norris got TCD disability pay"/>

==Campaigning and activism==
Norris took the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] to the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] over the criminalisation of homosexual acts. His claim was based on the fact that the law infringed on his right to privacy and that since the introduction of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] the law passed under British rule became repugnant to the constitution. The High Court ruled against Norris. He appealed his case to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]].<ref name="LaceyBrian">Lacey, Brian (2008) Terrible Queer Creatures: Homosexuality in Irish History. Dublin</ref> In 1983, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three to two verdict.<ref name="LaceyBrian"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Decision|url=http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/1983/3.html|accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref> 

Having lost the Supreme Court case, Norris took his case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (See [[Norris v. Ireland]]). In 1988, the European Court ruled that the law criminalising same sex activities was contrary to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], in particular Article 8 which protects the right to respect for private life. The law was held to infringe on the right of adults to engage in acts of their own choice.<ref>Norris v. Ireland - 10581/83 (European Court of Human Rights)</ref>
<blockquote>
<p>The first and immediate thing about the European decision is the enlargement of dignity and freedom for gay people <U+2013> but I think a decision like this enhances the dignity and freedom of all the people of Ireland because it pushes us towards a more tolerant and plural society.</p>

<p><U+2013> Norris's reaction to the European ruling, 1988.<ref name="McKittrick-SydneyMorningHerald"/></p>
</blockquote>

This law was repealed in 1993.

Norris has since then expanded his activism to a concept of "universal rights".
<blockquote>
I did start out on that campaign [for homosexual law reform] but I found very quickly that the mechanism of discrimination was exactly the same against women, against ethnic minorities, against the handicapped, so I broadened out and this now is how I see things, very much so.<ref name="independent1"/>
</blockquote>

==Political career==
Norris represents the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin constituency]] in the Seanad as an Independent. He was first elected to the Seanad in 1987, and has been re-elected at each election since.<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=4163|title=David Norris|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0428/1224295621916.html|title=Norris re-elected to Seanad|last=Hunt|first=Joanne|date=28 April 2011|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref>

Norris's candidacy was endorsed by British actor and writer [[Stephen Fry]], who said Ireland "couldn't have a more intelligent passionate and knowledgeable witty or committed President".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/david-norris-aras-bid-gets-celebrity-backing-165577-Jun2011/ |title=Norris<U+2019> <U+00C1>ras bid gets celebrity backing |publisher=The Journal |date= |accessdate=2011-06-29}}</ref>

In late July, it was revealed that Norris had written a letter in 1992 (29 August 1992) to an Israeli court asking [[pardon|clemency]] for his former partner [[Ezra Nawi]], who had been convicted of the [[statutory rape]] of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in 1992 but was awaiting sentencing. Norris's letter, written on parliamentary notepaper, said that Nawi had been lured into a "carefully prepared trap" and had unwisely pleaded guilty to the charges. The story was publicised by a pro-Israel blogger [[John Connolly (journalist)|John Connolly]]. Connolly stated that he had received a tip from "someone in the trade union movement".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Hate-mail-deluge-for-Irish-blogger-who-exposed-Norris-support-for-rapist-126507763.html|title=Hate mail deluge for Irish blogger|work=Irish Central|date=1 August 2011}}</ref> A number of people resigned from Norris's campaign team. While Norris himself said he remained committed to his campaign, he admitted that it was now "in serious trouble".<ref name="BBC-serious-trouble"/> It was claimed by some that these allegations, complete with Norris's subsequent defence of his comments on [[pederasty in ancient Greece]] would seriously damage his chances of securing a nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/norris-in-lastditch-attempt-to-save-presidential-bid-2671079.html|title=Norris in last-ditch attempt to save presidential bid|author=Fionnan Sheahan|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Time running out for Norris to turn campaign around|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0611/1224298736307.html|work=[[Irish Times]]|author=[[Harry McGee]]|date=11 June 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref> Norris refuted this, saying he still expected to receive a nomination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/despite-a-dirty-fight-norris-says-he-will-be-next-president-2672695.html|title=Despite a 'dirty fight' Norris says he will be next President|author=Joe Jackson|work=[[Sunday Independent]]|date=12 June 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref> and the controversy did not affect his poll standings.<ref name="Examiner2406"/>

As of 22 July, Norris had secured the support of 15 of the 20 members of the Oireachtas required for a nomination.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0722/breaking25.html|title=Two more Senators back Norris bid|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=22 July 2011}}</ref> On 1 August, the [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] TDs [[John Halligan (politician)|John Halligan]], [[Finian McGrath]] and [[Thomas Pringle (Irish politician)|Thomas Pringle]] announced that they were withdrawing their support for Norris over the revelations of the Nawi plea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0801/norrisd.html|title=Norris supporter Maureen O<U+2019>Sullivan says he has been the victim of a nasty campaign|work=RT<U+00C9> News|date=1 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/two-tds-withdraw-nominations-as-norris-campaign-hangs-in-balance-191029-Aug2011/|title=Two TDs withdraw nominations|work=The Journal|date=1 August 2011}}</ref> However, several other TDs re-iterated their support for Norris in his bid to become President.

Despite withdrawing from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his Presidency if they were given the choice to vote for him (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris number one in the [[proportional representation]] electorial system and 50 per cent saying they would give him a vote.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0811/breaking42.html "Byrne tops poll for presidency"] August 11, 2011, Irish Times Breaking News</ref>

Despite attempts, Norris didn't receive sufficient support from Oireachtas members to gain a nomination, having been nominated by 18 members, two short of the minimum number of 20.

Norris is a [[Christianity|Christian]] and regularly attends [[Church of Ireland]] services. He said the following of his religious beliefs:
<blockquote>I am the kind of Christian who believes that the most important theological principle is the principle of positive doubt. Even Christ doubted, on the cross. And I think if people say they hear the voice of God all the time and say they know what to do, then impose that on you, politically, it is theological tyranny. Whereas if you have doubt, it stops you from abusing your religious belief. Religion can be so abused in the interests of power, especially on behalf of institutions and governments.<ref name="independent1"/></blockquote>

Norris believes himself to be an "outsider" of "accepted society" and claims this gives him a heightened awareness of other minority or "outsider" groups. He says he wishes society to become more accepting of diversity. He has campaigned on mental health and child abuse issues.<ref name="independent1"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Mac |first=Conor |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/column-i-know-how-david-norris-feels-i-was-smeared-too/ |title=I know how David Norris feels <U+2013> I was smeared too |publisher=Thejournal.ie |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref>

When questioned on [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition|drug legalisation]] he said:<blockquote>The blunt instrument of criminalisation is not working because of the vast profits it generates for organised crime ... my view is that the welfare of the community, including the victims of drug abuse, may be better served by having access to quality controlled, legally prescribed drugs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Family fun |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/i-abhor-child-abuse-but-sexual-consent-is-complex-ndash-norris-2670243.html |title=I abhor child abuse but sexual consent is complex |publisher=Independent.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.ie/forum/irish-presidential-election-2011/162436-norris-publishes-open-letter-address-confusion-interpretation-his-views.html |title=Norris publishes open-letter to address 'confusion or interpretation' on his views |publisher=Politics.ie |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref></blockquote>

==Controversy==
===Fairytale of Kathmandu===
{{seealso|Fairytale of Kathmandu#Defence of <U+00D3> Searcaigh}}
On 11 March 2008, Norris called for the broadcast of the documentary ''Fairytale of Kathmandu'' (scheduled to be shown that evening on [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]) to be postponed. The film documented visits to [[Nepal]] by Irish poet [[Cathal <U+00D3> Searcaigh]], during which he had sex with young boys. It questioned whether he was sexually exploiting the boys or engaging in [[child sex tourism]]. Norris criticized that the film had been [[News leak|leaked]] beforehand and that <U+00D3> Searcaigh had been treated harshly by the media before its broadcast. He announced to the Seanad that the film should be checked for factuality, because he claimed that "public money" had been spent on it. The issue was conveyed to Deputy [[John Cregan (Irish politician)|John Cregan]], the Chairman of the ''Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/2008/03/11/00004.asp |title=Seanad Eireann Debate Vol. 188 No. 22 Page 4.|date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=24 February 2011 | work=[[Seanad <U+00C9>ireann]]}}</ref>

===Easter Rising comments===
An article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' claimed that Norris had, on more than one occasion, denounced the leaders of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] as "[[terrorism|terrorists]]".<ref name="sundaytimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7043719.ece|title=Profile: David Norris|date=28 February 2010|accessdate=25 October 2010|work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}</ref> In May 2011, Norris denied that article's claim also, saying "That's not true, it's a slur, and it's not fair on me. Terrorists are people who use civilian casualties to advance a political end. The men of 1916 produced the proclamation, addressed equally <U+2013> in an age when women didn't have the vote - to 'Irishmen and Irishwomen', that's wonderful!".<ref name="Independent 22 May">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/all-my-life-i-have-fought-against-being-labelled-and-against-stigma-2654239.html|title='All my life, I have fought against being labelled and against stigma'|work=[[Sunday Independent]]|date=22 May 2011|accessdate=24 May 2011|author=Jackson, Joe}}</ref> The newspaper printed a retraction.

===Criticism of Pope John Paul II===
Norris has made statements about Catholic social teaching on homosexuality, particularly in relation to the Papacy. He criticised [[Pope John Paul II]] for attacking homosexuality because the pope's hostile remarks led to anti-gay violence, saying that the pope was an "instrument for evil as far as I'm concerned because these constant, unremitting, ignorant, ill-informed attacks on the gay community have led to violence against the gay community". Norris also described the pope's position as "calculated and deliberate wickedness" because he "closes down scholarly enquiry" and because he "marginalised all the wonderful people like Oscar Romero, Leonardo Boff, Hans Kung, Charles Curran, all these marvellous people who are the future and the hope of the Church and, instead, put into place these mindless bureaucrats, which is intensely sad."<ref name="gaytoday">{{cite news|url=http://www.gaytoday.com/garchive/events/111301ev.htm|title='The Pope is Evil' says Gay Irish Senator, David Norris|accessdate=25 October 2010|work=Gay Today}}</ref> Commenting on then [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]], he said, "Ratzinger, who is, in his mind-set, a [[Nazi]]" because he is "afraid to tell the truth," and because he and John Paul II "won't even let themselves be in the presence of the truth, because it would shatter their very stylised view of things."<ref name="gaytoday"/> He later stated that he regretted using the term "Nazi" in reference to Ratzinger.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0609/breaking15.html|title=Norris 'confident' of nomination|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=9 June 2011}}</ref>

===2002 ''Magill'' magazine interview===
In a January 2002 interview for politics/current affairs magazine ''[[Magill]]'', Norris discussed the [[age of consent]], [[incest]],  [[pedophilia]] and [[pederasty]].<ref name="radical">{{cite web|title=The Free Radical|author=[[Helen Lucy Burke]]|date=January 2002|publisher=[[Magill]], scanned by [http://thejournal.ie thejournal.ie]}} [http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill1.jpg][http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill2.jpg][http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2011/05/DNmagill3.jpg]</ref> The interviewer, [[Food critic|restaurant critic]] [[Helen Lucy Burke]], said, "I found some of his views on sexual matters deeply disturbing - notably on sex with minors".<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/norrisarticle/ Extract from ''David Norris: The Free Radical''], ''Magill Magazine'', January 2002</ref> According to Burke, Norris didn't seem to support a minimum age of consent. When asked "Where would you draw the line?" Norris replied, "I would hope we could produce a society where people would be inclined to draw lines for themselves".<ref name=it22oct>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1022/1224306299793.html "Norris's views on sex between older and younger men broadcast on RT<U+00C9>"]. ''The Irish Times''. 22 October 2011.</ref> On 30 May 2011, Burke was a guest on the [[talk radio]] show ''[[Liveline]]''. Burke said that she had read the article to Norris before publication, and that he had wholeheartedly endorsed what was written. During the show, it was noted that the ''Magill'' article had been reported in a newspaper shortly after publication. The newspaper, ''[[Ireland on Sunday]]'', went with the headline "Senator Backs Sex With Children". Burke claimed that, when Norris saw the reaction to the interview, he "back-tracked" and denied saying what had been quoted. She also called Norris' views "evil" and "against the law".<ref>http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2011/pc/pod-v-30051138m17slivelinedavidnorris-pid0-2297928.mp3</ref>

According to Norris, he was only read two paragraphs of the interview before publication, and he asked for corrections to be made to those paragraphs, and these corrections were not made.<ref name=pod1>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2011/pc/pod-v-31051128m34stodaywithpatkenny-pid0-1714224.mp3|title=Pat Kenny interview|work=[[RT<U+00C9> Radio 1]]}}</ref> In a May 2011 statement on his Presidential campaign website, Norris affirmed "I did not ever and would not approve of the finished article as it appeared". Norris asserts that he and Burke engaged in an "academic discussion about [[Classical Greece]] and sexual activity in a historical context; it was a hypothetical, intellectual conversation" and that the "presentation of references to sexuality in the article attributed to me were misleading in that they do not convey the context in which they were made".<ref name="Ask David: Magill article">{{cite web|url=http://www.norrisforpresident.ie/askdavid/magill-magazine-2002|title=Ask David: Statement on Magill Magazine profile|work=Norris for President website|accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> Norris also spoke about the ''Magill'' profile in an interview with Joe Jackson for the ''[[Sunday Independent]]'', in which he refutes the allegations, saying he responded in "horror", and that <U+201C>it so completely misrepresents everything I said. In the interview I said I cannot understand how anyone would consider it appropriate to have sex with children".<ref name="The Joe Jackson interviews">{{cite web|url=http://joejacksonjournalist.com/2010/09/06/david-norris-the-joe-jackson-interview/|title=David Norris <U+2013> The Joe Jackson interviews 2002 and 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> 

The interview was recorded and on 21 October 2011 it was played on the radio talk show ''Liveline''.<ref name=it22oct/>
