'''Hans-Joachim "Hajo" Herrmann''' (1 August 1913 <U+2013> 5 November 2010)<ref>http://www.pro-sarrazin.net/archives/2549</ref><ref>http://npd-thueringen.de/?p=430</ref> was a [[Luftwaffe]] bomber pilot and later after the end of World War II, focusing his activities as a lawyer on civil and criminal law. In [[World War II]], he was a high ranking and influential member of the Luftwaffe. He was also a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern}}). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves and Swords was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.

== Military career in WWII ==
Herrmann was one of the Luftwaffe's most innovative air tacticians during [[World War II]]. Beginning his military career as an infantry officer, he was commissioned in the newly formed Luftwaffe in 1935. From 1936 until 1937, he was a [[bomber]] pilot in the [[Condor Legion]]. During the [[Spanish civil war]], Herrmann joined [[Kampfgeschwader 4|KG-4]], and wrote several well received tactical reports. When World War II began, he flew [[Heinkel]] [[He-111]]s in [[Poland]] and [[Norway]]. By 1940, he was Commander of the 7th Staffel of KG-4, and led many attacks on [[England]] during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In February 1941, his group went to [[Sicily]], where it flew against [[Malta]] and [[Greece]]. In one such attack, Herrmann dropped a single bomb on an ammunition ship, the [[SS Clan Fraser (1938)|SS Clan Fraser]]; the resulting explosion sank 11 ships and made the [[Greece|Greek]] port of [[Piraeus]] unusable for many months. In early 1942, he was Commander of [[Kampfgeschwader 30|III./KG 30]], attacking Arctic convoys from [[Norway]], including the attacks on [[PQ-17]]. July 1942 saw him assigned to the general staff in Germany, where he became a close confidant of [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]]. During his career as a bomber pilot, Herrmann flew 320 missions and sank 12 ships totalling 70,000 tons.

In 1942, Herrmann was appointed to the Luftwaffe Operational Staff. Quickly gaining a reputation as one of the leading tactical and operational innovators of the Luftwaffe, he was the creator of the Luftwaffe [[night fighter]] wing designated [[Jagdgeschwader 300]], nicknamed ''[[Wilde Sau (Luftwaffe night fighter tactics)|Wilde Sau]]'' (German: wild boar). Raised as a response to the growing threat of [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Bomber Command's night raids on the Reich in mid-1943, which had gained the ascendancy over the Luftwaffe's ''Nachtj<U+00E4>ger'' radar-guided night fighter forces through the use of [[chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]], Herrmann's theory was for experienced night flying pilots and ex-instructors to be equipped with [[Fw 190]] day fighters and visually 'free-hunt' the bombers by the light of the fires below and with the aid of special 'flare-carrier' [[Junkers Ju 88]]s following the bomber streams, as well as the use of the [[Naxos radar detector]] unit on some of these single engined fighters, to find RAF night bombers, when they were aiming by radar. Herrmann himself flew more than 50 night fighter missions and claimed nine RAF bombers destroyed. Although JG 300 and subsequent units raised met with promising initial success, the high wastage of both pilots and aircraft due to high accident rates curtailed extensive use of 'Wilde Sau' beyond the start of 1944.

In December 1943, Herrmann was appointed Luftwaffe Inspector of Aerial Defence.  By 1944, he was Inspector General of night fighters and received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. At the end of 1944, he led the [[9th Air Division (Germany)|9. ''Flieger-division (J)'']]. At this time he was a leading exponent of the tactical deployment of the so-called ''Rammj<U+00E4>ger'' ''[[Sonderkommando Elbe]]'' (German: ram fighters, task force [[Elbe]]), sent into action in April 1945. Pilot volunteers, often aged 18 to 20, were to be trained to be simply competent enough to control specially lightened and unarmoured [[Bf 109]] fighters and charged with downing Allied bombers by deliberately ramming the tail or control surfaces with the propellers of their aircraft, and thereafter (hopefully) bailing out. Herrmann's intention was to gather a large number of these fighters for a one-off attack on the [[USAAF]] bomber streams, hopefully causing enough losses to curtail the bombing offensive for a few months. Fuel shortages prevented employment of the large numbers necessary, although from one mission of this type of the 138 planes thus committed only 50 came back.{{Chronology citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Post war activities ==
Herrmann was captured by the Russians after the war and was held prisoner for 10 years before returning to Germany in 1955. Back in Germany, he studied law and settled in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]]. Among others, he defended [[Otto Ernst Remer]], [[David Irving]], and [[Fred A. Leuchter]].{{cn}} In 1959 Herrmann married the German soprano [[Ingeborg Reichelt]]. The marriage produced two children.{{cn}}

Herrmann celebrated his 95th birthday in 2008, and continued making public appearances. A former Luftwaffe colonel, Herrmann was one of the highest-ranked surviving German Luftwaffe officers.<ref name="test">(http://logr.org/fnkoeln/2010/05/30/328/.</ref>
