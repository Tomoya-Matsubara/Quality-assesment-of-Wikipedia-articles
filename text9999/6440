"'''The Revenge'''" is the seventh episode of the [[Seinfeld (season 2)|second season]] of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and the show's twelfth episode overall. The story revolves around [[George Costanza]]'s ([[Jason Alexander]]) plot to exact revenge on his boss, with his friend [[Elaine Benes]]' ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) help, after he quits his job and is refused re-employment. Meanwhile, [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] ([[Jerry Seinfeld]]) and his neighbour [[Cosmo Kramer]] ([[Michael Richards]]) get even with a laundromat owner<U+2014>who they believe has stolen money from Jerry<U+2014>by pouring [[cement]] into one of his washing machines.

Written by series co-creator [[Larry David]] and directed by [[Tom Cherones]], the episode premiered in the United States on [[NBC]] on April 18, 1991. Largely based on David's own experiences, "The Revenge" was the first episode he wrote without Seinfeld's collaboration. The episode also contained the first mention of [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], as a [[suicidal]] man who lives in Jerry and Kramer's apartment building, who would later become a popular recurring character. Some cast and crew members consider the episode a turning point for the show, as it is the first in which Kramer does [[physical comedy]]. When first broadcast in the United States, the episode gained a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 14.4/24 and was met with positive response from critics.

==Plot==
The episodes relates three parallel plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being banned from the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with his friend Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try to go back to work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan ([[Fred Applegate (actor)|Fred Applegate]]), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|mickey]] into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back during a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] sprinkled with insults at George's expense, George tells him to "drink up", which he does. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.

The second plot of the episode revolves around Jerry; when he prepares to go to the laundromat, Kramer asks if he could take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. Vic (John Capodice), the owner of the laundromat, tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes up with a plan to put [[cement]] mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.

In a [[subplot]], Kramer tells Jerry about his suicidal friend [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]] who repeatedly threatens to kill himself by jumping off the apartment building. When he does jump, he jumps from the second floor and survives, much to Kramer's amusement. At the end of the episode, Newman threatens to jump again, Kramer asks Newman if he wants to go shoot some pool with him, but Newman declines, stating that he has plans to go to the movies.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewers Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling gave the episode a mixed review and [[Academic grading in the United States|graded]] it with a C, stating "Although neat for its parallel plotting and George's hilariously clueless career chats with Jerry, 'The Revenge' is not so sweet".<ref>{{cite web|author=Schilling, Mary Kaye; Flaherty, Mike|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20189707,00.html|title=The ''Seinfeld'' Chronicles: Season Two|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2009}}</ref> [[IGN]] critic Andy Patrizio considered "The Revenge" one of his personal favorites of season two.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patrizio|first=Andy|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/567/567021p1.html|title=Seinfeld - Seasons 1 & 2 Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 18, 2004|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}</ref> The scene in which Kramer struggles to put cement in one of the washing machines has gained positive responses from critics.
