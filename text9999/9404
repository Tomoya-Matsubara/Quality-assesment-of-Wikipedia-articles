'''Route 200''' is a road that traverses the width of the Island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai<U+2018>i]], from [[downtown]] [[Hilo]] to its junction with [[Hawaii State Highway 190|State Route 190]] near [[Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Waimea]]. The road is considered one of the most dangerous ''paved'' roads in the state, with many one-lane bridges and areas of marginally maintained pavement.  It reaches a maximum height of 6,632 [[Foot|feet]] (2,021 [[metre]]s) and is subject to fog and low visibility.  Many rental car companies prohibit use of their cars on Saddle Road.  Nevertheless, it provides the only access to the slopes of [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]].

There are no [[List of highway shields in the United States|highway shields]] posted along the entire route.  The only  indications that this is Route 200 are two shields on '''[[Hawai<U+2018>i Belt Road|M<U+0101>malahoa Highway]] [190]''' marking the approaching junction and the small black-on-white [[Commemorative plaque|plaques]] attached to the mile markers.

==History==
With the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] fresh in their memories, the [[U. S. Army|U.S. Army]] hastily built an [[access road]] in [[1942]] to service their ''Pohak<U+016B>loa Training Area'' and ''Bradshaw Army Airfield'' in the Humu<U+2018>ula Highlands of Parker Ranch. Since it was not intended as a [[civilian]] road, the construction method was simple: clear, grade, pave. [[Military vehicle]]s of all types and [[tread]]s traversed the Island for the next three years.

Following the end of [[World War II]] in [[1945]], the Army turned over [[jurisdiction]] of the road to the [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai<U+2018>i]] and was designated '''Route 20''' but the territorial government had few funds to maintain the road, let alone upgrade it to civilian standards. The story was the same as the newly formed [[Hawaii|State of Hawai<U+2018>i]] took over jurisdiction in [[1959]]. Saddle Road was subsequently handed to the [[Hawaii County|County of Hawai<U+2018>i]] but little has ever been done to road with the exception of patching some of the more notorious [[pothole]]s.

==Wai<U+2018><U+0101>nuenue Avenue==
The [[Milestone|MILE <U+00D8>]] marker is posted on the [[traffic signal]] at the [[Intersection (road)|intersection]] of '''''Wai<U+2018><U+0101>nenue Avenue''''', '''[[Hawai<U+2018>i Belt Road#Highway 19|Kamehameha Avenue]]''' and '''Bayfront Highway'''. The route continues ''mauka'' along '''''Wai<U+2018><U+0101>nuenue Avenue''''' to a little over a half-mile past the MILE 1 where it veers left onto '''''Ka<U+016B>mana Drive''''' near Gilbert Carvalho Park. Further along '''Wai<U+2018><U+0101>nuenue Avenue''' is Rainbow Falls Park.
*TOTAL MILES = 1.7 (2.7kM)

==Ka<U+016B>mana Drive==
Starting at the <U+201C>[[T junction|Y]]<U+201D> junction adjacent to Gilbert Carvalho Park, Highway 200 continues ''mauka'' on '''''Ka<U+016B>mana Drive''''' and provides access to many [[neighbourhood]]s overlooking Hilo. The road is quite narrow and windy with many blind corners, hidden [[driveway]]s and open drainage [[ditch]]es. Just past MILE 6 is the junction with '''P<U+016B><U+2018><U+0101>inak<U+014D> Street Extension [2000]''', completed in September [[2004]] as a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] of the above-mentioned windy sections. The intersection with '''Ua Nahele Street''' at MILE 8 marks the ''mauka'' terminus of '''''Ka<U+016B>mana Drive'''''.
*TOTAL MILES = 6.2 (9.9kM)

==Saddle Road==
The ''official'' start of '''''Saddle Road''''' is at the <U+201C>[[T junction|T]]<U+201D> intersection of '''Ua Nahele Street''' at MILE 8. This is the last neighbourhood through which the route will pass.  As it has from its beginning in [[Hilo]], Route 200 continues to climb towards the Humu<U+2018>ula Saddle between [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]]. The [[rainforest]] of the Hilo Forest Reserve and Upper Wai<U+0101>kea Forest Reserve surround the roadway and begin to thin as the [[elevation]] increases.  Quality of the [[asphalt]] surface is quite good on this side of the [[Route summit|crest]] but there are many curves and rises with limited visual distances.

The terrain becomes the high lava desert of the Humu<U+2018>ula Saddle. Two roads intersect '''''Saddle Road''''' close to Pu<U+2018>u Huluhulu at its crest near MILE 28 at 6,632 feet (2,021 metres) above [[sea level]]:

*'''Mauna Loa Observatory Road''' is an unmarked 17.1 mile (27.5kM) long narrow rough road connects to '''Hilo-Kona Road''' ([[Tom Vance]], who spearheaded several [[civil engineering]] projects on-Island, spent $1 million in [[1949]] to build a straight road on the Hilo-Kona alignment but work stopped a year later when the work camp caught fire one night and burned everything) then winds its way towards a number of [[Mauna loa#Scientific observations|scientific observatories]] on the slopes of Mauna Loa.
*'''Mauna Kea Summit Road''' ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|a/k/a]] '''[[John A. Burns]] Way''') provides access to  [[Ellison Onizuka|Onizuka Center for International Astronomy]] ([[elevation]] 9,300ft / 2,835m) then climbs to the height of 13,780[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]] (4,200m) at grades averaging 17% making this the third highest [[public road]] in the [[United States]]; Pu<U+2018>u W<U+0113>kiu is the highest point in Hawai<U+2018>i at 13,796ft (4,208m) and is home to [[Poliahu|Poli<U+2018>ahu]], [[Goddess]] of [[Snow]].  Many of the world's best [[Observatory|observatories]] occupy the summit area and are under the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai<U+2018>i]].

The new road alignment will start on the ''kona'' side of the '''Mauna Kea Summit Road''' junction. Until its completion, Route 200 will continue along the [[1942]] version of '''''Saddle Road''''' through the [[List of United States Army installations#United States|P<U+014D>hakuloa Training Area]]. Many conditions make this section of Route 200 hazardous: The road is a narrow ribbon of poorly-maintained [[Pavement (material)|pavement]]; there are several one-lane bridges; military vehicles <U+2014> including [[tank]]s <U+2014> occasionally cross or occupy the roadway; and oversized trucks delivering heavy equipment to the summit facilities. It is also common for drivers to negotiate the centre of the road to avoid the rough shoulders.

There is a sharp curve at MILE 25 adjacent to the entrance to Mauna Kea State Park (one of the few [[emergency telephone]]s is located here). '''''Saddle Road''''' then passes the main gates to P<U+014D>hakuloa Training Area and Bradshaw Army Airfield before continuing across the Humu<U+2018>ula Saddle.

At the far end of the [[Mountain pass|saddle]], near MILE 35, '''''Saddle Road''''' climbs a steep [[Grade (slope)|grade]] to the [[Waiki<U+2018>i]] Crest before descending down the last ten miles (16.1kM) past the community of Waiki<U+2018>i Ranch. The terminus of Route 200 comes at its junction with '''[[Hawaii State Highway 190|M<U+0101>malahoa Highway]] [190]''' six miles (9.6kM) ''kona'' of [[Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Waimea]].
*TOTAL MILES = 45.7 (73.6kM)

==Future plans==
Construction is underway on a four-mile stretch ''mauka'' of the Army base, between MILE 24 and 28, which is scheduled for completion in early [[2007]].  Also under way is a project to reroute part of Saddle Road now passing through the Army base, between MILE 28 and MILE 42, to a 12.7 [[mile]]-long new alignment at the foot of [[Mauna Kea]]. Part of the new roadway is expected to open to traffic by early 2007, with the remainder opening in [[2008]] (but remember, it took 34 years to complete the [[Interstate H-3|H3]] on [[Oahu|O<U+2018>ahu]] !).

Other realignment proposals include a section near Ka<U+016B>mana Country Club Estates as well as one that would bypass Waiki<U+2018>i and connect to '''M<U+0101>malahoa Highway''' at either MILE 15 or at the ''mauka'' terminus of '''Waik<U+014D>loa Road''' (in which case the Route 200 designation would be extended an additional twelve miles (19.3kM) to '''[[Hawaii State Highway 19|Queen Ka<U+2018>ahumanu Highway]] [19]'''.
