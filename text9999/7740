"'''I Kissed a Girl'''" is the seventh episode of the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]] of the American musical television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and the 51st overall. Written by Matthew Hodgson and directed by [[Tate Donovan]], the episode aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on November&nbsp;29, 2011, and featured the election for a new senior class president at McKinley High. It also covered the special congressional election between [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) and [[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]), plus repercussions from the outing of [[Santana Lopez|Santana]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) during the congressional campaign.

The episode as a whole received mixed to negative reviews from critics, though several praised Santana's scene with her grandmother. The music was viewed more favorably by reviewers, and earned mixed to positive reactions. Cover versions of six songs are performed in the episode, including [[Katy Perry]]'s "[[I Kissed a Girl]]", from which the episode takes its name. All six were released as downloadable singles, and five of them charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 7.90&nbsp;million American viewers and garnered a 3.2/8&nbsp;[[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|Nielsen rating/share]] in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18<U+2013>49 demographic]]. The total viewership and ratings were up from the previous episode, "[[Mash Off]]", which had aired two weeks before.

==Plot==
[[Santana Lopez|Santana]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) is about to be suspended for hitting [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]), but he claims it was merely a stage slap. He then blackmails Santana into having her glee club, the Troubletones, temporarily meet with her former club, New Directions, so he can show her how they all support her. [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) and [[Blaine Anderson|Blaine]] ([[Darren Criss]]) sing "[[Fuckin' Perfect|Perfect]]" to her, which leaves her unimpressed, but Finn's slow, stripped-down rendition of "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]" is better received. 

[[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]) ostensibly sings "[[I'm the Only One]]" for Santana, but delivers most of the song to an embarrassed [[Shelby Corcoran|Shelby]] ([[Idina Menzel]]) in front of a suspicious [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]). Quinn later tries to seduce him, but he rebuffs her, and calls her crazy. Shelby calls Puck for assistance when her daughter Beth has a minor medical emergency; the two later have sex, but she regrets it and asks him to leave. Angered, Puck returns to Quinn, and she reveals her desire to have a second baby with him. Puck refuses, and tries to comfort her; he offers to share an important secret if she promises not to tell anyone.

Kurt's quest to become senior class president appears doomed and along with it his college prospects; he confesses to [[Rachel Berry|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]) that he is thinking about stuffing the ballot box to ensure that he wins. [[Sue Sylvester|Sue]]'s ([[Jane Lynch]]) congressional campaign is also in trouble: to combat allegations that she is a lesbian, Sue decides to start an arbitary relationship with a man, and chooses former bedmate Cooter Menkins ([[Eric Bruskotter]]), who has been having difficulty connecting with Coach Beiste ([[Dot-Marie Jones]]) due to her emotional armor. A distraught Beiste sings "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]", confesses her love for Cooter and tells Sue she won't give him up without a fight. Sue loses the congressional election to [[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]).

An arrogant jock tries to seduce Santana to "make her normal". The female members of both glee clubs defend her, and together they sing "[[I Kissed a Girl]]". Santana comes out to her parents, who are accepting, but when she tells her ''abuela'' (grandmother), she tells Santana to leave and never return, saying it is a sin to speak of such things. 

Kurt and his father Burt are called in to see [[Principal Figgins]] ([[Iqbal Theba]]), where it is revealed that although Kurt apparently won his election by 190 votes, more votes have been cast than there are students. Kurt admits that he contemplated cheating, but decided against doing so. Nevertheless, Kurt is disqualified and Brittany wins the election. Kurt tells Finn and Rachel that he is still under suspicion, and after he leaves, Rachel admits to Finn that she was the one who stuffed the ballot box because she wanted to help Kurt. 

To end the week, Santana sings "[[Constant Craving]]" to the combined glee clubs, intercut with Shelby and Kurt also singing. Rachel then arrives and confesses that she was the one who committed election fraud: the incident will go on her permanent record, she is suspended for a week and she is banned from participating in the impending show choir Sectionals competition.

==Production==
The episode was written by Matthew Hodgson and directed by [[Tate Donovan]]. Filming began on October 13, 2011, while the fifth and sixth episodes, "[[The First Time (Glee)|The First Time]]" and "[[Mash Off]]" respectively, were still shooting,<ref>{{cite web|last=Michele|first=Lea|title=Twitter / @msleamichele: First scene up..

Series co-creator [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] revealed to ''[[TV Guide]]'' that the episode would have not one election in it, but two: both senior class president and the congressional special election would occur on the same day, and McKinley High will be a polling place for the latter. According to Brennan, "People are voting for both elections in the school, with signs pointing voters in different directions", and there will be a "very surprising twist" in the final results.<ref name="TVG">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Glee-Sue-Origins-1039162.aspx |title=Keck's Exclusives: ''Glee'' Reveals Sue's Evil Origins |first=William |last=Keck |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=October 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
The episode as a whole received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Rae Votta of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that it "stumbles as much as it shines, with two plotlines-worth of structure that make sense, and two that fall completely flat".<ref name="BBRV">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/glee-recap-the-kids-are-alright-but-those-1005580352.story|title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: The Kids Are Alright, But Those Adults ...|first=Rae|last=Votta|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} Erica Futterman stated that "while there were undeniably significant plot moments, the emotional depth was lacking", and Robert Canning of [[IGN]] said that while it was not a bad episode, it was "kind of boring" and nothing happened to "make it better than bland".<ref name="RS">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/glee-recap-i-kissed-a-girl-and-it-was-just-ok-20111130 |title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: 'I Kissed a Girl' and It Was Just OK |last=Futterman |first=Erica |date=November 30, 2011 |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref><ref name="IGN">{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1213615p1.html |title=Glee: "I Kissed a Girl" Review |last=Canning |first=Robert |date=November 30, 2011 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> ''AOLTV''{{'s}} Crystal Bell called it "down-right frustrating", and said that the "worst part" was that it "made me stop caring about these characters".<ref name="AOL">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/11/29/glee-season-3-episode-7-recap/|title={{-'}}Glee' Season 3, Episode 7 Recap: Santana Comes Out and There's a New Class President|first=Crystal|last=Bell|work=AOLTV|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V.

Lesley Goldberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that the scene where Santana comes out to her grandmother only to be rejected was a "powerful moment and Rivera delivered in a way equal to Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley's scenes during Kurt's coming out".<ref name="HR">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glee-recap-santanas-coming-party-267266|title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: Santana's Coming Out Party |first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> Bell also complimented the sequence, though she criticized the next scene for showing "a happy, smiling Santana" with no further explanation, and Canning and Kubicek were also unhappy with her abrupt change in mood, as if nothing had happened.<ref name="IGN"/><ref name="WP"/><ref name="Buddy"/> VanDerWerff, though he called the coming-out scene "a moment that's played with a sort of bracing honesty and moving empathy" for what Santana was going through, stated that the "Santana storyline has been one of the best things about the back half of season two and this front half of season three, and the scenes that should be its emotional crux are occurring in our imaginations", such as when she comes out to her parents.<ref name="AV"/> Goldberg called the fact that Finn suffered no consequences for his outing of Santana "a missed opportunity".<ref name="HR"/> Bell, however, thought that his telling Santana that "he cares about her and doesn't want her to hold her feelings for women in anymore" was "one of the most touching scenes of the series", though Kubicek characterized Finn's statement that he cared for her because Santana "was his first" as creepy.<ref name="WP"/><ref name="Buddy"/> [[MTV]]'s Kevin P. Sullivan deried the choice to perform "I Kissed a Girl" as "poor comprehension of song lyrics", since Santana "is a lesbian and not just [a] drunk girl who kissed another girl after drinking".<ref name="MTV"/> VanDerWerff wondered why Santana was so happy during the song, since she had just experienced "the sort of outrageous bigotry she'll have to put up with for the rest of her life".<ref name="AV"/>

{{Triple image|right|IdinaMenzel-TodayShow.jpg|100|Mark Salling Glee Premiere.jpg|135|Glee's Dianna Agron.jpg|215|The storylines centered on the growing intimacy between teacher Shelby (Menzel, ''left'') and student Puck (Salling, ''center'') and on the irrational behavior exhibited by Quinn (Agron, ''right'') were strongly criticized by reviewers.}}
Quinn's increasingly odd behavior was commented on by several reviewers. Chaney wrote that she was acting "in an irrational manner that has no connection with reality", and Bell wondered if co-creator Murphy was "trying to make her the most hated character on 'Glee' ever".<ref name="AOL"/><ref name="WP"/> Amy Reiter of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', though she noted that "Quinn's character just gets weirder and weirder", wrote that Puck gets it right: "Quinn's the craziest, most self-involved character on the show", but "has a resilience that may take her far in life" and needs a "healthy dose of self-esteem".<ref name="LAT">{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/11/glee-recap-out-of-the-flannel-closet.html|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: Out of the flannel closet!|date=November 30, 2011|first=Amy|last=Reiter|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> VanDerWerff was initially pleased that the show "acknowledged that all of her actions are driven by a deep, sucking need to be loved" and that "Puck gently told her that she was better than that, that she could put herself together again", but not that it then "just turned into more pointless Puck/Shelby/Quinn drama. Ugh."<ref name="AV"/> Critics such as Kubicek were even more scathing about Shelby and the storyline with Puck that led to the pair having sex during the episode: "The dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber."<ref name="Buddy"/> Sullivan called it "the most divisive plot line of the season", and Bell asked, "Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we please get more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?"<ref name="AOL"/><ref name="MTV"/>

Votta was one of several reviewers who lambasted the show for "another pointless adult love triangle", this one involving Coach Beiste, Sue, and Cooter Menkins.<ref name="BBRV"/> VanDerWerff described Jones as "one of the show's greatest gifts", and lamented that they had her "fighting with Sue Dynasty-style over a recruiter for Ohio State".<ref name="AV"/> Bell called the scene where Beiste "confesses her love for Cooter" a "simply sweet scene that's only ruined by Sue's grumpy presence", and Sue's decision to go after Cooter a "crazy plot".<ref name="AOL"/> Votta looked at Sue's pursuit of Cooter through a different lens: "in an episode that should be about kids who are looking for approval and the various ways they do and don't achieve that", the show gives a "completely opposite message from Sue's quest to prove her straightness", which "muddles" the show's messages.<ref name="BBRV"/> Chaney thought that Sue "was back in fine, vindictive catchphrase-spewing form", and noted that "all the election subplots were tied up remarkably quickly".<ref name="WP"/> This last point did not sit well with Berk, who wrote that the show resolved "what was one of the more interesting subplots in one of the least interesting ways", and Canning was disappointed that the episode did not have "more with Burt".<ref name="IGN"/><ref name="VF"/> As for Burt's son, Kurt, Votta wanted to "leap through the television and explain to him that student council elections mean absolutely nothing" to his future college prospects, and Kubicek declared himself "sick" of that plot thread, which he called "just plain moronic".<ref name="BBRV"/><ref name="Buddy"/>

===Music and performances===
The musical performances received somewhat more praise than criticism from reviewers. Hankinson wrote that it was a "strong night".<ref name="HC"/> Chaney was more tempered, and characterized it as "decent but not as strong" as the previous episode, "[[Mash Off]]"; Futterman had a similar take and called it a "hodge-podge of songs that fit the bill but don't necessarily stand out", and "musically meh".<ref name="RS"/><ref name="WP">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/glee-by-the-musical-numbers-a-coming-out-party-for-santana/2011/11/29/gIQABaMIBO_blog.html |title={{-'}}Glee' by the musical numbers: A coming out party for Santana |date=November 30, 2011 |last=Chaney |first=Jen |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> Bell wrote that "the music was awful", and she was upset because she "really like[s] chick rock", the musical focus of the episode.<ref name="AOL"/>
