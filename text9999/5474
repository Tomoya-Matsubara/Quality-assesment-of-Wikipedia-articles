'''''Bahia''''' was the [[lead ship]] of a [[Bahia-class cruiser|two-vessel class]] of [[cruiser]]s built for [[Brazil]] by the British company [[Armstrong Whitworth]]. In November 1910, just six months after her [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]], crewmen aboard ''Bahia'', {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Marechal Deodoro||2}}, {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}}, and {{ship|Brazilian battleship|S<U+00E3>o Paulo||2}} mutinied, beginning the {{lang|pt|''Revolta da Chibata''}} ([[Revolt of the Lash]]). During the four-day rebellion, Brazil's capital city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was held hostage by the possibility of a naval bombardment, leading the government to give in to the rebel demands, which included the abolition of [[Flagellation|flogging]] in the navy. During the First World War, ''Bahia'' and her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}} were assigned to the {{lang|pt|''Divis<U+00E3>o Naval em Opera<U+00E7><U+00F5>es de Guerra''}} (Naval Division in War Operations), the [[Brazilian Navy]]'s main contribution in that conflict. Based out of [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Dakar]], the squadron escorted convoys through an area believed to be heavily patrolled by [[U-boat]]s.

In the mid-1920s, ''Bahia'' was extensively modernized. She received three new [[John Brown & Company|Brown<U+2013>Curtis]] turbine engines and six new [[Water-tube boiler#Thornycroft|Thornycroft boilers]], and, in the process, was converted from coal-burning to oil. The refit resulted in a striking aesthetic change, with the exhaust being trunked into three funnels instead of two. The armament was also modified; three {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Madsen gun]]s, a {{convert|7|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] machine gun, and four {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes were added. In the 1930s, she served with government forces during multiple revolutions.

In the Second World War, ''Bahia'' was once again used as a convoy escort, sailing over {{convert|100000|nmi|km mi}} in the span of about a year. On 4 July 1945 she was acting as a [[plane guard]] for [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]] flying from the Atlantic to Pacific theaters of war. While ''Bahia''{{'}}s gunners were firing at a kite for anti-aircraft practice, one aimed too low and hit [[depth charge]]s stored near the [[stern]] of the ship, resulting in a massive explosion that incapacitated the ship and sank her within minutes. Only a small portion of the crew survived the blast, and even fewer were still living when their rafts were discovered days later.

==Mutiny==
{{Main|Revolt of the Lash}}
:''See also: "[[South American dreadnought race#Brazilian naval revolt|Brazilian naval revolt]]"''
Brazil's economy was suffering from a severe recession at the same time ''Bahia'' was commissioned.<ref name=Smallman28>Smallman, ''Fear & Memory'', 28.</ref> This economic hardship, along with the racism prevalent in all branches of the Brazilian armed forces, and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships, spawned a mutiny known as the {{lang|pt|''Revolta da Chibata''}} ([[Revolt of the Whip]]) among sailors on the most powerful ships.<ref name=Smallman28/><ref name=Scheina74>Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 74.</ref>

Unhappy with the violent treatment they were receiving, black sailors on the dreadnought battleship {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}} began planning an uprising early in 1910, choosing [[Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto]] <U+2014> an experienced sailor later known as the "Black Admiral" <U+2014> as their leader.<ref name=Smallman28/> In mid-November, a sailor was sentenced to be flogged in front of his fellow sailors, even though the practice had been banned by law.<ref name=Smallman28/><ref name=Scheina74/> The punishment was administered and continued even after the sailor fainted,<ref name=Smallman28/> infuriating the nascent mutineers. Although they were not ready and could not revolt immediately, they quickened their preparations and rebelled on 21 November, earlier than originally planned.<ref name=Scheina74/> They killed several officers and the captain of ''Minas Geraes'', while other officers were forced off the ship.<ref name=Scheina74/> The revolt quickly expanded to the battleship {{ship|Brazilian battleship|S<U+00E3>o Paulo||2}}, the elderly coastal defense ship {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Marechal Deodoro||2}}, and ''Bahia''.<ref name=Scheina74/> While joining the revolt, the crew of the scout&nbsp;cruiser murdered one of their officers.<ref name=Poder/> During this time, discipline on the rebelling ships was not relaxed; daily drills were conducted and Felisberto ordered all liquor to be thrown overboard.<ref name=Scheina74/>

[[File:Joao Candido.jpg|thumb|left|Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto with reporters, officers and sailors on aboard ''Minas Geraes'' on 26 November 1910, the final day of the rebellion.]]
The crews of the [[torpedo boat]]s remained loyal to the government,<ref name=Scheina74/> and army troops moved to the [[Catete Palace|presidential palace]] and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers.<ref name=Smallman28/> The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause,<ref name=Scheina74/> coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the [[National Congress of Brazil]] to give in to the rebels' demands.<ref name=Smallman28/> These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers.<ref name=Smallman28/><ref name=Scheina74/> The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26&nbsp;November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.<ref name=Smallman28/>

==First World War==
{{See also|Brazil during World War I}}
In the opening years of the First World War, the Brazilian Navy was sent out to patrol the South Atlantic with French, British and American naval units, although its ships were not supposed to engage any threat outside territorial waters as Brazil was not at war with the [[Central Powers]].<ref name="Scheina35, 37-38">Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 35, 37<U+2013>38.</ref> The country also tried to ensure that it remained totally neutral; ''Bahia'' and ''Rio Grande do Sul'' were sent to [[Santos, S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Santos]] in August 1914 to enforce neutrality laws when it was reported that the German raider {{SMS|Bremen||2}} was lying in wait off that port for British and American merchant ships.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01E5D8113FE633A25754C0A96E9C946596D6CF Warships off Argentina]," ''The New York Times'', 7 August 1914, 7.</ref>{{#tag:ref|''The New York Times''{{'}} article refers to {{SMS|Bremen||2}}, but that ship was in the [[Baltic Sea]] at the time. The only German cruiser in that area in August 1914 was {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}}. The misidentification was probably due to the [[fog of war]].|group=upper-alpha}} Brazil joined the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] and declared war on the Central Powers on 26 October 1917.<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref name="Scheina35, 37-38"/>

On 21 December 1917, the Brazilian Navy<U+2014>at the behest of the British<U+2014>formed a small naval force with the intent of sending it to the other side of the Atlantic.<ref name=Scheina38>Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 38.</ref> On 30 January 1918, ''Bahia'' was made the [[flagship]] of the newly organized {{lang|pt|''Divis<U+00E3>o Naval em Opera<U+00E7><U+00F5>es de Guerra''}} (Naval Division in War Operations, abbreviated as DNOG), under the command of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Pedro Max Fernando Frontin]].<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref name=Poder/> The other ships assigned to the squadron were ''Bahia''{{'}}s sister ''Rio Grande do Sul'', {{sclass-|Par<U+00E1>|destroyer (1908)|0}} destroyers {{ship|Brazilian destroyer|Piau<U+00ED>||2}}, {{ship|Brazilian destroyer|Para<U+00ED>ba||2}}, {{ship|Brazilian destroyer|Rio Grande do Norte||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian destroyer|Santa Catarina||2}}, [[Ship's tender|tender]] {{ship|Brazilian tender|Belmonte||2}}, and tugboat ''Laurindo Pita''.<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref name=Poder/><ref name=Conways403/><ref name=Scheina38/>

The DNOG sailed for the British colony of [[Sierra Leone]] on 31 July. Since other allied countries helped with logistics, little was provided by Brazil aside from the ships themselves and the men crewing them.<ref name=Scheina38/> Despite the threat of a [[U-boat]] attack, they were forced to stop several times so ''Belmonte'' could transfer necessities such as coal and water to the other ships.<ref name=Scheina38/> They reached [[Freetown]] safely on 9 August and remained in the port until 23 August when they departed for [[Dakar]].<ref name=Scheina38/> While on this section of the voyage, ''Bahia'', ''Rio Grande do Sul'', ''Rio Grande do Norte'', ''Belmonte'' and ''Laurindo Pita'' spotted an apparent torpedo heading for ''Belmonte'', but it missed. ''Rio Grande do Norte'' then fired several shots and depth-charged what the force believed to be a U-boat.<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref name=Scheina39>Scheina, ''Latin America{{'}}s Wars'', 39.</ref> While the official Brazilian history of the ship definitively claims to have sunk a submarine,<ref name=BrazilNavy/> author [[Robert Scheina]] notes that this action was never confirmed,<ref name=Scheina39/> and works published about U-boat losses in the war do not agree.<ref>Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 396.</ref>

After arriving in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, [[Cape Verde]] and [[Gibraltar]]; the Allies believed that this area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through.<ref name=Scheina39/> As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for [[naval mine|mines]] laid by German minelaying submarines and to make sure that [[convoy]]s passing through would be safe.<ref name=Scheina39/> Complications arose when both ''Bahia'' and ''Rio Grande do Sul'' had problems with their [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.<ref name=Scheina39/>

In early September, the squadron was struck by the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu pandemic]].<ref name=Scheina39/> The contagion began aboard ''Bahia'', spread to the other ships of the squadron and remained present for seven weeks.<ref name=Scheina39/> At one point, 95% of some of the ships' crews were infected; 103&nbsp;died overseas, and 250&nbsp;died in Brazil after returning there.<ref name=Scheina39/> On 3 November, ''Bahia'', three of the four destroyers, and the tugboat were sent to Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean Sea.<ref name=Scheina39/> They arrived on 9&nbsp;or 10 November,<ref name=Poder/><ref name=Scheina39/><ref name=IsraelDANFS>"[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i3/israel.htm ''Israel'']," ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'', [[Naval History & Heritage Command]]/[[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]].</ref>{{#tag:ref|Sources give different dates; the ''Navios de Guerra Brasileiros'' and ''Israel''{{'}}s ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'' entry give 9 November, while Scheina gives 10 November.<ref name=Poder/><ref name=Scheina39/><ref name=IsraelDANFS/>|group=upper-alpha}} escorted by the American destroyer {{USS|Israel|DD-98|2}},<ref name=Poder/><ref name=IsraelDANFS/> but the fighting ceased on the 11th when the [[Armistice with Germany]] was signed.<ref name=Scheina39/> Sometime in early 1919, ''Bahia'', accompanied by four destroyers, voyaged to [[Portsmouth]], England; they then traveled across the [[English Channel]] to [[Cherbourg]], arriving there on 15 February.<ref name="NYT 1919">"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CEFDC1139E13ABC4E52DFB4668382609EDE Brazilian Warships at Cherbourg]," ''[[The New York Times]]'', 16 February 1919, 23.</ref> The commander of the squadron, Admiral [[Pedro Max Fernando Frontin]], met with the [[Maritime Prefect]] prior to the commencement of "social events"; these lasted until 23 February, when the ships moved to [[Toulon]] and Frontin journeyed overland to Paris.<ref name="NYT 1919"/> The DNOG was dissolved on 25 August 1919.<ref name=BrazilNavy/>

==Modernization and inter-war years==

==Second World War==
After Brazil's entrance into the Second World War on 21 August 1942, which took effect on 31 August,<ref name=Scheina164>Scheina, ''Latin America{{'}}s Wars'', 164.</ref> ''Bahia'' was used extensively for escorts and patrols; sources conflict as to the actual number<U+2014>either 67 and 15<ref name=BrazilNavy/> or 62 and 11.<ref name=Whitley22/> In total, she traveled {{convert|101971|nmi|km mi|abbr=on}} in 358 days, and played a role in shepherding over 700&nbsp;merchant ships,<ref name=BrazilNavy/> despite being labeled by the [[United States Naval Institute]]'s magazine [[Proceedings (magazine)|''Proceedings'']] as being an "oversized destroyer" which was "relatively slow".<ref>"Brazil," [[Proceedings (magazine)|''Proceedings'']] '''65''' (June 1939): 436; 901<U+2013>902; quoted in Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 164.</ref>

On 3 June 1943, while ''Bahia'' was escorting the convoy BT<U+00A0>12, she located an [[naval mine|underwater mine]] and destroyed it with one of her {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} Madsen guns.<ref name=BrazilNavy/> On 10 July, while at {{Coord|26|15|S|43|35|W}}, ''Bahia'' received a [[sonar]] contact and [[depth charge|depth-charged]] what the Brazilian Navy's official history of the ship reports might have been the German submarine {{GS|U-199||2}}, which was sunk later that month in the same area (off Rio de Janeiro) by American and Brazilian aircraft.<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b2/barnegat-ii.htm "''Barnegat''"], ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'', Naval History & Heritage Command/Navy Department.</ref> In November 1944, ''Bahia'' joined the American [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Omaha|CL-4|2}} and [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Gustafson|DE-182|2}} in accompanying the 4th Squadron of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] as they were carried on the troop transport {{USS|General M. C. Meigs|AP-116|2}} to Italy.<ref name=BrazilNavy/>

''Bahia'' was modernized again twice during the war, in both 1942 and 1944; these modernizations were not as extensive as those of the 1920s. Two of her [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|{{convert|47|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] guns were replaced with {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/23 AA guns, her Madsen guns were replaced with seven [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm cannons]] in single mounts, and a [[fire-control system|director]] for these guns was installed.<ref name=BrazilNavy/> Two depth charge tracks were added, improved range-finders were added to the {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, and sonar and radar were fitted, in addition to other minor modifications.<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref group=upper-alpha>Regarding the installation of sonar, it is not clear whether it was fitted for the first time in 1942 (and used in the 10 July depth charging) or whether a more modern sonar replaced an outmoded version in either 1942 or 1944.</ref> The Brazilian Navy's official history of the ship reports these modifications, but does not specify which were undertaken in which year.<ref name=BrazilNavy/>

At the end of hostilities in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theater]] in May 1945 various warships of the Allied nations, including Brazil's, were assigned to patrol in the Atlantic as rescue ships, standing by near routes frequented by [[military transport aircraft]] carrying personnel from Europe to the continuing [[Pacific Theater of Operations|war in the Pacific]].<ref name=Poder/><ref name=Scheina169>Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 169.</ref> ''Bahia'' was one such ship;<ref name=Scheina169/> on 4 July 1945, she was stationed northeast of Brazil around {{Coord|0|N|30|W}}, near the {{lang|pt|''Arquip<U+00E9>lago de S<U+00E3>o Pedro e S<U+00E3>o Paulo''}} ([[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]]).<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref name=Scheina427/><ref name=Poder/> For anti-aircraft target practice, crewmen were firing the ship's 20&nbsp;mm guns at a kite that was being towed behind the ship. One of them shot it down, but also accidentally hit the [[depth charge]]s on the [[stern]]<U+2014>a direct consequence of the lack of guide rails that would normally prohibit the guns from being aimed at the ship.<ref name=Scheina427>Scheina, ''Latin America{{'}}s Wars'', 427.</ref><ref name=Poder/> The resulting explosion knocked out all power on the ship and sank her in about three minutes.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Scheina427/><ref name=TimeBrazil>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,803597,00.html Brazil: Disaster]," ''Time'', 23 July 1945.</ref>

The survivors of the blast endured four or five days of no food, high temperatures and full exposure to the sun on their makeshift rafts;<ref name=TimeBrazil/><ref name=NYTSufferings>"Rescued Brazilians Tell Of Sufferings," ''The New York Times'', 12 July 1945, 22.</ref> some, driven mad by these conditions, simply jumped into the water and were devoured by sharks.<ref name=NYTSufferings/> From this point on, sources vary greatly.
