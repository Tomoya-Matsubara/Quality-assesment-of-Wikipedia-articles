'''''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''''', named after [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo|the city]], was an early [[dreadnought]] built for the [[Brazilian Navy]]. Authorized in 1905 as the second of two ships in the {{Sclass|Minas Geraes|battleship|4}}, she was launched on 19 April 1909 and commissioned on 12 July 1910. Soon after, she was involved in the "[[Revolt of the Whip]]", in which crews on Brazilian warships mutinied over bad pay and harsh punishments for even minor offenses. 

When Brazil entered the First World War, the British declined its offer to send ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' and her [[Sister ship|sister]] {{Ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}} to Britain to serve in the [[Grand Fleet]] because both ships were in poor condition and neither had been modernized with any of the improvements in fire control technology that had been developed since the vessels' commissioning. To address this, Brazil sent ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' to the United States for a full refit, which was not completed until 7 January 1920, well after the war had ended. On 6 July 1922, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' fired her guns in anger for the first time when she fired on a fort that had been taken during the [[Tenente revolts]]. Two years later saw the dreadnought embroiled in a second mutiny; the mutineers sailed the ship to [[Montevideo]] where they obtained [[Right of asylum|asylum]].

In the 1930s, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was passed over for modernization due to the bad condition the ship was in&mdash;she could only reach a top speed of {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}}. For the rest of her career, the ship was reduced to a "reserve coast defense" role. When Brazil entered the Second World War, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' traveled to the port of [[Recife]] and remained there as the port's main defense for the duration of the war. Stricken in 1947, the dreadnought remained as a [[training vessel]] until 1951, when she was taken under tow to be scrapped in the United Kingdom. The tow lines broke during a strong gale on 6 November when the ships were {{convert|150|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} north of the [[Azores]], and the ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was not seen again.

== Background ==
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Brazil had fallen to the third largest South American naval power, behind Chile and Argentina. After the revolution of 1889, in which [[Deodoro da Fonseca]] deposed [[Pedro II of Brazil]], the navy fell into disrepair. By 1900 the only relatively new ships larger than {{convert|3000|t|ST|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] were two [[Coastal defence ship|coastal defense battleships]] of the {{Sclass|Deodoro|battleship|4}} and two cruisers.<ref group=A>Two other coastal defense ships, ''Riachuelo'' and ''Aquidab<U+00E3>'', had been rebuilt in 1893<U+2013>1895 and 1897<U+2013>1898, respectively.</ref>

At the turn of the twentieth century, however, soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought prosperity to the Brazilian economy.<ref name=Sondhaus216>Sondhaus (2001), p. 216</ref><ref name=Conways403>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 403</ref> The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a large name building program in 1904;<ref name=Conways>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 404</ref> this authorized the construction of 28 ships, including three battleships and three armored cruisers.<ref name=Sondhaus216/> The program was approved by the Brazilian Congress in 1905. The battleships' design was derived from that of the Norwegian [[Coastal defence ship]] [[HNoMS Norge|''Norge'']] and the British (formerly Chilean) {{HMS|Triumph|1903|2}}. They were intended to be ships of {{convert|12000|t|ST|abbr=on}} with twelve {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} guns in five twin turrets, driven at up to 19&nbsp;[[Knot (speed)|knots]] by [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|triple-expansion engines]], with {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} of [[belt armor]] and {{convert|1.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} deck [[armour]].<ref>Whitley (1999), pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref>

The government ordered the three ships from [[Armstrong Whitworth]], who subcontracted parts of the work out to [[Vickers]]. However, the advent of [[dreadnought]]s forced Brazil to halt construction almost immediately after the battleships were laid down,<ref name=Whitley24>Whitley (1999), p. 24</ref> as they would have been obsolete if completed as originally planned.<ref name=BrazilNavy/> Instead, all construction that had been done was torn down, and the naval architects prepared an entirely new design. This required a new contract, which the Brazilians signed on 20 February 1907. The new design called for a modern dreadnought that would have a maximum speed of {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}} and carry twelve [[EOC 12 inch /45 naval gun|{{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}}/45 caliber guns]] for its main armament. Even though this meant that only two ships could be completed immediately,<ref name=Whitley24/> plans went ahead. ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', "the largest and most powerful [battleship] in the world", along with her sister,<ref name=Conways/> was ordered on 4 March 1907.<ref>{{Cite news| date = 5 March 1907| title = A Dreadnought for Brazil| work = The New York Times| page = 5| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9906E1DE1E30E233A25756C0A9659C946697D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref> Vickers ([[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]]) laid them down on 30 April 1907.<ref name=Conways/>

The news shocked Brazil's neighbors, especially Argentina, as the new dreadnoughts "outclassed the entire Argentinian fleet."<ref>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 400</ref> In addition, Brazil's order meant that they had laid down a dreadnought before many of the other major maritime powers, such as Germany, France or Russia;<ref group=A>Although Germany laid down {{SMS|Nassau||2}} two months after ''Minas Geraes'', ''Nassau'' was commissioned first. See: Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 145 and 403</ref> ''Minas Geraes'' and ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' made Brazil the third country to have dreadnoughts under construction, behind the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref name=Sondhaus216/><ref name=Conways403/><ref>Whitley (1999), p. 13</ref> In particular, the United States now actively attempted to court Brazil as an ally; caught up in the spirit, U.S. naval journals began using terms like "Pan Americanism" and "Hemispheric Cooperation". Across the sea, British and German professional magazines each speculated that Brazil was just covering for a larger naval power and was planning to hand over the ships to a 'real' owner when they were complete.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Miller84>Miller (2001), p. 84</ref>

== Service ==
=== Early career ===
''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 April 1909 with many South American diplomats and naval officers in attendance. She was christened by the wife of Brazil's minister to Great Britain, Senhora Regis de Oliveira.<ref>{{Cite news| date = 20 April 1909| title = Launch Brazil's Battleship| work = The New York Times| page = 5| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F00E7DA1539E733A25753C2A9629C946897D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref> After she was completed, she left [[Greenock]] on 16 September 1910.<ref name=Whitley28>Whitley (1999), p. 28</ref> Shortly thereafter, she stopped in [[Cherbourg, France|Cherbourg]], France to embark the [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] [[Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca]]. While there, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that officers aboard ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' attempted to visit the [[Maritime Prefect]] but were rebuffed; the paper speculated that this could cause an [[International incident|diplomatic incident]].<ref>{{Cite news| date = 25 September 1910| title = French Criticise Brazil| work = The New York Times| page = C4| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F00E2DD1F39E333A25756C2A96F9C946196D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref> Departing the city on 28 September, she voyaged to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where Fonseca was a guest of Portugual's King [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]].<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref name="Keeping Good Order">{{Cite news| date = 8 October 1910| title = Keeping Good Order in New Republic| work = The New York Times| page = 1<U+2013>2| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D03E1DB1F39E333A2575BC0A9669D946196D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref> However, soon after they arrived, the [[5 October 1910 revolution]] began.<ref name=BrazilNavy/> Although the President offered [[Right of asylum|political asylum]] to the King and his family, the offer was refused,<ref name=BrazilNavy/> which may have been a fortunate choice: "leftists" hunting for the missing king boarded and searched the dreadnought while she was in Lisbon.<ref>Schenia (2003), p. 73</ref> ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' left on 7 October<ref name="Keeping Good Order"/> bound for [[Rio de Janeiro]], where she arrived on 25 October.<ref name=Whitley28/>

Just a little more than a month later, she was involved in the "[[Revolt of the Whip]]". A combination of factors spawned the mutiny, including an economic depression, low pay and the frequent mistreatment of and discrimination against black crew members by white officers. Beginning on ''Minas Geraes'', the mutiny quickly spread to other ships, including ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', the old coastal defence ship ''Deodoro'', and the new cruiser ''Bahia''.<ref name=Smallman28>Smallman (2002), p. 28</ref><ref name=Schenia74>Scheina (2003), p. 74</ref><ref>Andrews (2004), p. 148</ref>

Led by an experienced member of ''Minas Geraes''{{'}}s crew, [[Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto]] (the "Black Admiral"), the rebels stayed disciplined, aided by Felisberto's order that to throw all liquor overboard and his requirement of daily drills.<ref name=Scheina74>Scheina (2003), p. 74</ref> Afraid that the most powerful warships in the Brazilian Navy would bombard the capital, and with the army unable to help (as they were confined to the shores), the [[National Congress of Brazil]] gave in to the rebels' demands.<ref name=Smallman28/> These demands included the abolition of flogging, the improvement of living conditions, and the granting of amnesty.<ref name=Scheina74/> However, Congress passed a decree on 28 November that many considered as reversing the amnesty<U+2014>the decree allowed the Minister of the Navy to fire any sailor "undermining discipline."<ref>Smallman (2002), pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref>

''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' carried the foreign minister of Brazil to the United States in May 1913.<ref name=Whitley28/> A year later, the [[World War I|First World War]] began. Brazil declared on 4 August 1914 that they would be neutral, but the sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German [[U-boat]]s led them first to revoke their neutrality and then to declare war on 26 October 1917.<ref>Scheina (2003), pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref> By this time, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was no longer one of the world's most powerful battleships. She had not been fitted with any of the advances in fire-control that had appeared since her construction, and she was in poor condition.<ref>Schenia (2003), p. 37</ref> For these reasons the [[Royal Navy]] rejected a Brazilian offer to send her and ''Minas Geraes'' to the [[Grand Fleet]].<ref name=Conways/> In an attempt to bring battleship up to international standards, Brazil sent ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' to the United States in June 1918 to receive a full refit. However, soon after she departed the naval base in Rio de Janeiro, fourteen of the eighteen boilers powering the dreadnought broke down.<ref name=Whitley28/> The {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|6}}, which was in the area after transporting the deceased Uruguyan Minister to the United States to [[Montevideo]],<ref>{{cite DANFS | title = Nebraska | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/n3/nebraska.htm | accessdate=17 April 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> rendered assistance in the form of temporary repairs after the ships put in at [[Salvador, Bahia|Bahia]]. Escorted by ''Nebraska'' and the [[protected cruiser]] {{USS|Raleigh|C-8|6}}, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' made it to the [[New York Naval Yard]] after a 42-day journey.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Whitley28/>

=== 1920s ===
''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' underwent refitting from 7 August 1918 to 7 January 1920. She receuved [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] fire control equipment and [[Bausch and Lomb]] range-finders for the two [[Superfire|superfiring]] [[Gun turret|turrets]] [[Bow (ship)|fore]] and [[aft]]. A vertical armor [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] was fitted inside of all six main turrets, and the secondary battery of {{convert|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[casemate]] guns wasreduced from 22 to four guns. A few modern [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] guns were fitted as well: two [[3"/50 caliber gun]]s from [[Bethlehem Steel]] were added on the aft superstructure, 37&nbsp;mm guns were added near each turret, and [[Ordnance QF 3 pounder Vickers|3 pounders]] were removed from the top of turrets.<ref name=Whitley27/> During this refit, the second-in-command of the ship, Lieutenant Freire, married Ms. M. Rosich of Puerto Rico after a two-week courtship.<ref>{{Cite news| date = 8 October 1919| title = Wed Brazilian Officer| work = The New York Times| page = 19| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E3DD1038EE32A2575BC0A9669D946896D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref>

''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' returned home in early 1920 after gunnery practice at Guantanamo Bay.<ref name=Whitley28/> August 1920 saw the dreadnought voyaging across the [[Equator]] to Belgium, where she embarked King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]] and Queen [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876<U+2013>1965)|Elisabeth]] on 1 September to transport them to the centennial celebrations in Brazil.<ref name=BrazilNavy>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval.com.br/historia/dreadnought/dreadnought-port1.htm|title=Os Dreadnoughts Da Marinha Do Brasil: Minas Geraes e S<U+00E3>o Paulo|accessdate=16 April 2009|author=Paulo de Oliveira Ribeiro|date=1997|publisher=Brazilian Navy|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| date = 1 September 1920| title = King Albert and His Queen Sail for Brazil Today| work = The New York Times| page = 1| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C04E1DB103FE432A25752C0A96F9C946195D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref>

[[File:Fort Copacabana 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fort Copacabana seen around 1920]]

In 1922, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' and her sister ship helped to put down the first of the [[Tenente revolts]]. Soldiers seized [[Fort Copacabana]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 5 July, but no other men joined them. As a result, some men deserted the rebels, and by the next morning only 200 people remained in the fort.<ref name=Schenia123>Schenia (2003), p. 128</ref> ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' bombarded the fort, firing five salvos and obtaining at least two hits; the fort surrendered half an hour later.<ref name=BrazilNavy2>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval.com.br/historia/SP_x_Copacabana/SP_x_Copacabana_p2.htm|title=Um encoura<U+00E7>ado contra o forte: 2<U+00AA> Parte|author=Guilherme Poggio|date=n.d.|publisher=Poder Naval Online|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

Crewmen aboard ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' rebelled again on 4 November 1924, when First Lieutenant [[Hercolino Cascardo]], seven second lieutenants and others commandeered the ship.<ref>Scheina (2003), p. 129</ref> After the boilers were fired, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' "steamed menacingly" around her sister in an attempt to entice her and other ships to join the rebellion.<ref name=Whitley29/> However, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was only able to sway one old [[torpedo boat]] to her cause.<ref name=Whitley29/> Her crew, angry that ''Minas Geraes'' would not join them, shot a six-pounder at ''Minas Geraes'' which wounded the ship's cook.<ref name=Whitley29/><ref name=BrazilNavy/> The mutineers then sailed out of the harbor, exchanging shots with forts at the entrance along the way, and set course for [[Montevideo]] in Uruguay., where they arrived on 10 November. The rebellious members of the crew disembarked and were granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]],<ref name=Whitley29/> and ''Minas Geraes'', which had been pursuing ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', escorted the wayward ship home to Rio de Janeiro, arriving on the 21st.<ref name=BrazilNavy/>

=== Late career ===
By the 1930s, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' and ''Minas Geraes'' were showing their age, so a decision to modernize both ships was made. However, the terrible state that ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was in<ref>Sandler (2004), p. 98</ref><U+2014>she could go at a maximum of only 10&nbsp;knots,<ref name=Whitley29>Whitley (1999), p. 29</ref> less than half of her design speed of 21&nbsp;knots<ref name=Conways/><U+2014>made this uneconomical. As a result, while ''Minas Geraes'' was totally refitted from 1931<U+2013>35 in the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard,<ref name=Whitley27>Whitley (1999), p. 27</ref><ref name="Conways 1980">Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), p. 416</ref> ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' became a "reserve coast defense" ship, a role in which she remained for the rest of her service life.<ref name=Whitley29/>

As in the First World War, Brazil stayed neutral during the opening years of the [[World War II|Second World War]] until U-boat attacks drove the country to declare war on Germany and Italy on 21 August 1942.<ref>Schenia (2003), p. 163<U+2013>164</ref> The age and condition of ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' relegated her to the role of "floating battery"; she set sail for [[Recife]] on 23 November 1942 with the escort of two American destroyers ({{USS|Badger|DD-126|2}} and {{USS|Davis|DD-395|2}}) and defended the port for the war.<ref name=Whitley29/>

[[File:S<U+00E3>o Paulo 1942.jpg|right|thumb|''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' in 1942]]

Stricken on 2 August 1947,<ref name=Whitley29/> the ship remained as a [[training vessel]] until August 1951,<ref name=BrazilNavy/> when she was sold to the [[British Iron and Steel Corporation]]. ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was taken under tow by two tugs, ''Dexterous'' and ''Bustler'', in Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951 for one last voyage to the breakers. Somewhere around {{convert|150|nmi|mi km}} north of the [[Azores]]<ref name=Whitley29/> on 6 November, the two lines snapped during a [[gale]], and ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', with the eight men who had been stationed on her still on board, sank shortly thereafter.<ref name=BrazilNavy/><ref name=Whitley29/>
