'''Tetley's Brewery''' '''(Joshua Tetley & Son Ltd)''' was a large [[regional brewery]] founded in 1822 by [[Joshua Tetley]] in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, which operated for 189 years until its closure in June 2011. It produced a range of beers, including ''Tetley's Bitter'', and was the world's largest producer of [[cask ale]]. In 1998 it was taken over by the [[Carlsberg Group]]. Tetley's is among the ten highest selling beer brands in the United Kingdom, but nevertheless, sales in 2010 were less than half of those in 2004.<ref>Euromonitor, 2010</ref> 

With the closure of the brewery, production of ''Tetley's Smoothflow'' was transferred to the [[Molson Coors]] [[Tadcaster]] plant, Tetley cask products were contracted to [[Marstons]]' [[Wolverhampton]] plant and Tetley's [[keg]] milds and Imperial was contracted to [[Camerons Brewery|Camerons]] of [[Hartlepool]]. All other products such as [[Skol]] were transferred to Carlsberg's [[Northampton]] plant.

== History ==
[[File:Tetley's brewery gatehouse and entrance (24th June 2010).jpg|left|thumb|Tetley's Brewery gatehouse and entrance in 2010.]]
The Tetley family's links with the beer industry go back to the 1740s when William Tetley was described as a maltster in Armley. His son William then expanded the business, which in turn was passed to his son Joshua. In 1822, [[Joshua Tetley]] leased a brewery in Salem Place, [[Hunslet]] for <U+00A3>400.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-13768975 BBC News - Tetley's closes Leeds brewery landmark<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Joshua Tetley and Son was created in 1839 when Joshua made his son, Francis William, a partner.<ref>http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/business-news/tetley_s_a_history_1_2524572</ref> Joshua died in 1859, leaving the business to Francis, who took on a his brother in law, Charles Ryder, as a partner.

By 1860 Tetley was the largest brewery in the [[North of England]] and by 1864 Joshua Tetley and Son were starting an ambitious building scheme.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/central-leeds/leeds_a_look_back_at_the_tetley_years_1_3452499 Leeds: A look back at the Tetley years - Top Stories - Yorkshire Evening Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1875 Tetley brewed 171,500 barrels of beer.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com.ezproxy.lib.le.ac.uk/view/article/88642 Oxforddnb.com.ezproxy.lib.le.ac.uk]</ref>

Tetley bought its first two [[public houses]] in 1890. Only one remains today, The Fleece in [[Farsley]], Leeds. The other, the Duke William, which was in Tetley<U+2019>s yard, was "unceremoniously demolished" by Carlsberg in 2002.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> In 1892, the company went public to raise money for a bottling operation and was valued at <U+00A3>572,848.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In 1932 the Market Tavern, next to Leeds' Kirkgate market was leased by Leeds City Council to Tetley<U+2019>s for <U+00A3>550 a year. The council had higher offers from two other breweries, but opted for Tetley<U+2019>s <U+201C>because it sells the most popular brew in the view of the Corporation<U+201D>.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/central-leeds/leeds_the_houses_that_joshua_tetley_filled_1_3458523 Leeds: The houses that Joshua Tetley filled - Top Stories - Yorkshire Evening Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Image:Brewery Wharfe.jpg|thumb|right|Brewery Wharf; the building shown was formerly the Brewery Museum.]]
Tetley's position as Leeds' largest brewer was confirmed in 1960 when it announced a takeover of Leeds' Melbourne Brewery.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> That same year they merged with [[Walkers of Warrington]] to form [[Tetley Walker]]. After the takeover Tetley owned over 1000 [[tied house]]s in Yorkshire alone, and 2000 across the country.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref name=autogenerated3 /> Towns such as [[Garforth]] and [[Wetherby]] show a cross over between pubs traditionally run by [[Leeds]] based Tetley's and [[Tadcaster]] based [[John Smith's]], being as the towns are approximately equidistant between the two breweries. In 1961 Tetley merged with [[Ind Coope]] and [[Ansells]] to form [[Allied Breweries]], then the world's largest brewing conglomerate.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> At its height in the 1960s the brewery employed over 1000 workers.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> By the 1970s half of Leeds' pubs were owned by Tetley.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

During the 1980s Tetley was at the forefront of the [[real ale]] revolution as sales of [[cask ale]] increased.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tetley%27s_Bitter&action=edit&section=1 View source for Tetley's Bitter - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Between 1970 and 1980 the number of its pubs selling real ale in Leeds rose from about 50 to almost all of its 300-plus venues.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> At its peak Tetley's was Britain's largest cask ale brewery.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> An impartial customer survey in the 1980s concluded that Tetley had achieved an almost irrational level of customer support, particularly in West Yorkshire, in part because of traditional loyalty, partly because of highly effective television campaigns such as the Tetley Bittermen, and also because of a consistently high quality product.<ref name="Ward p 40">John Smith and his Tadcaster brewery, Ward & Tattersall-Walker, p 40</ref>

In 1993 Allied Breweries sold its 50 per cent stake in the company to the Danish brewer [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]. The brewery opened a museum on 19 March 1994.<ref>[http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=2002126_40897769 Leodis.net]</ref><ref>[http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=10369&DISPLAY=FULL Leodis.net]</ref>  The attraction proved popular; however, redevelopment of the land surrounding the brewery led to the attraction's closure on 7 April 2000. The building is now bars and restaurants.<ref>[http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=2007814_164474 Leodis.net]</ref>

By 1996, sales of Tetley Bitter were overtaken by sales of [[John Smith's]], and the product has retained the number two ale position ever since.<ref>John Smith and his Tadcaster brewery, Ward & Tattersall-Walker, p 42</ref> This is largely attributed to Tetley's ineffective marketing campaigns.<ref name="Ward p 40"/>

[[File:Tetley's Cask.jpg|left|thumb|A pint of Tetley Cask.]]
In 1998 Tetley's was taken over by [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]], who had previously held a 50 per cent stake in the business. In 2004 Tetley was dropped from the Carlsberg-Tetley name.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/central-leeds/leeds_tetley_s_the_brewery_that_served_its_community_1_3454505 Leeds: Tetley<U+2019>s - the brewery that served its community - Top Stories - Yorkshire Evening Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The company is now called Carlsberg UK Limited and is a part of Carlsberg AS group.

In 2006, Tetley's sold 185&nbsp;million pints of beer in pubs. In the same year, the brewery's famous [[dray horse]]s, which had made beer deliveries to pubs around Leeds, were retired.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

The brewery's closure was announced in 2008. Darran Britton, Carlsberg UK marketing director, defended the closure, saying "People are drinking less. Five pubs a day are closing. This is not about the workforce. It is an old brewery and the one in Northampton is bigger and more modern."<ref>November 6, 2008 2:00 am Carlsberg to close Leeds' Tetley brewery By Andrew Bounds</ref>
In December 2010 production of Tetley's cask products was transferred to Banks's brewery in [[Wolverhampton]]. Tetley Smoothflow will be brewed by Coors in [[Tadcaster]] and Tetley keg Dark Mild, Mild and Imperial will be brewed by Cameron's of Hartlepool.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/at-a-glance/main-section/sadness_as_historic_city_brewery_to_close_doors_after_190_years_1_3425947 Sadness as historic city brewery to close doors after 190 years - Main Section - Yorkshire Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The final brew took place on 24 May 2011. Lager production was transferred to [[Northampton]].

Despite protests that Tetley Cask brewed in Wolverhampton would taste different, the new beer has been greeted with a warm reception.<ref>http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/General-News/CAMRA-marks-end-of-an-era</ref><ref>http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/leeds-tetley-bitter-import-gets-the-thumbs-up-1-4459242</ref>

== Brewery ==
The brewery was situated on the south banks of the [[River Aire]] near Crown Point, [[Hunslet]] and [[Clarence Dock (Leeds)|Clarence Dock]]. In 1906 the brewery stood on a fraction of its current site between Brook Street, Hunslet Road (this part now being known as Hunslet Lane), Crown Point Road and Waterloo Street. Many smaller streets in the vicinity have since disappeared under the ever extending brewery.<ref>ISBN 0-85054-250-2</ref> The closure of the brewery was announced on 5 November 2008. The brewery finally closed its doors on 17 June 2011.<ref>http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/leeds_gates_close_on_tetley_s_as_179_staff_lose_jobs_1_3488990</ref> Carlsberg tried to redeploy some staff throughout the group but 179 staff did lose their jobs. The sprawling site is in an area of prime office and residential land which is worth at least <U+00A3>100 million.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/06/tetley-leeds-closure-brewing-industry</ref>

All fermenting took place in stainless steel Yorkshire squares and conical vessels; the slate Yorkshire squares, dating from about the 1880s, were broken up and removed in autumn 2008.<ref>http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/gazetteer-breweries/bhs-operating-breweries.pdf</ref>

The brewery was often known as "Leeds Brewery", and should not be confused with a microbrewery of [[Leeds Brewery|that name]] which opened in 2007.<ref>

==Product range==
[[Image:Tetley's tins.jpg|thumb|right|Tetley's Original (left), Smoothflow (right) designs used during the 1990s and 2000s.]]
The Leeds brewery produced a wide range of products, including [[cask ale]], keg ale, keg lager, bottled lager and canned ([[widget (beer)|widget]]) ale and lager. The main products were Tetley's Cask, Tetley's Smoothflow and Tetley's Mild.

The brand is exported overseas (particularly in the [[US]]) as 'Tetley's English Ale'.<ref>[http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/8535/706/?ba=bros Beeradvocate.com]</ref>

===Products===
The highest selling Tetley product is Smoothflow, nitrogenated, pasteurised and chilled 3.6% ABV ale served at 8 degrees Celsius. Export versions of Tetley are usually a variation of Smoothflow.

Tetley Cask (3.7% ABV) is the [[cask conditioned]] version of the product, served in pubs at cellar temperature. It is available pasteurised in cans as Tetley Original.

Mild - Carlsberg brew the Tetley's Mild in both light and dark forms. 3.2% ABV.

Imperial - Originally created for the [[Teesside]] market, and at one point was advertised as "Teeside's favourite pint". It was launched nationally as a premium 4.3% cask ale in 2002. It used three separate yeasts and had eight months of development, but the variant has since been withdrawn.<ref>Mason, T 2002, 'Tetley's targets youth with Extra Cold', Marketing (00253650), p. 3, Business Source Premier, EBSCOhost, viewed 26 April 2011.</ref> It continues as a pasteurised ale in kegs.

About 24,000 [[hectolitres]] of Tetley's Milds and Imperial were sold in 2010.<ref>Alcoholic Drinks: Euromonitor from trade sources/national statistics</ref>

==Marketing==

Tetley's advertising hit a bad spot during the 80s when its TV ads dwelled on the past too much, with scenes of Yorkshire pubs and men in flat caps swigging pints with a Jack Russell at their feet.<ref>http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/business-news/tetley_s_is_still_ale_and_hearty_1_2524573</ref>

In the 1960s the huntsman logo was introduced.<ref>http://www.fdin.org.uk/2011/09/tetleys-canned-ales-get-a-fresh-new-look/</ref> In 2000 Tetley's dropped its traditional huntsman logo, due to growing [[animal rights|anti-hunt]] feelings in the UK, but in 2010 the image was revived.<ref>http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/tetleys-a-gamble-that-built-an-empire-1-2196744</ref><ref>http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/leeds-fury-over-tetley-s-huntsman-logo-1-2242891</ref>

In 2006 Tetley's changed its slogan from 'Smoothly Does It' to its current slogan of 'Don't Do Things By Halves', and launched a <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million television advertising campaign.<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5346781/Tetley-s-TV-ads-show.html Goliath.ecnext.com]</ref>

Following a break for a number of years from television advertising, Tetley returned to the screens in October 2010 as part of an 18 month sponsorship deal with [[ITV4]].<ref>[http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/news.ma/article/89437 Morningstaradvertiser.co.uk]</ref> This forms a part of the <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million that Carlsberg intend to invest into the brand over the coming years.

=== Sponsorship ===
Tetley's along with John Player became [[rugby league football]]'s first ever sponsors for the 1971-72 season.<ref>{{cite news

Tetley's also sponsored the [[Rugby League]] [[Super League]] from [[Super League V|2000]] until [[Super League IX|2004]]. Tetley's remain a major sponsor at Leeds Rhinos and are the official beer of most Super League clubs.  Tetley's also sponsor the stadium of [[Dewsbury Rams]] which under a sponsorship deal is known as the [[Crown Flatt|Tetley's Stadium]]. Tetley's is also involved in [[Rugby Union]], although less prominently, and has a contract with [[England RUFC|England]] Rugby Player [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]].

===Other forms of advertising===
[[File:Tetley's Stand Northampton RFC.jpg|thumb|left|The Tetley stand at Northampton RFC.]]
An early form of advertising occurred in 1911 when Tetley challenged [[escape artist]] [[Harry Houdini]] to escape from a padlocked metal cask of ale. Houdini accepted this challenge; however, it proved too much for him and he had to be rescued from the cask.<ref name="dontdothingsbyhalf.com">[http://www.dontdothingsbyhalf.com/Content.aspx Dontdothingsbyhalf.com]</ref>

Tetley's make use of [[billboards]] for a lot of their advertising, particularly across Leeds. Hoardings at the side of sports pitches are used, and such have often been rented at [[Elland Road]] and the [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley Carnegie Stadium]] (both on the [[Leeds Rhinos]] side and the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] side. Tetley's also advertise in the matchday programmes of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Leeds Rhinos]], [[Leeds Carnegie]] and [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]].  It is unclear whether this will continue, should the brand relocate to Northampton.

==Closure==
On 5 November 2008, Carlsberg UK announced they intended to close the plant in 2011, moving production to [[Northampton]], owing to the falling demand for beer and lager products in the UK.  The move was first reported on [[BBC Radio Leeds]].  The company was criticised{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} for choosing to announce the closure the day after [[Barack Obama]] was elected [[US president]] to ensure the news would not get any significant coverage in the British national press, leaving only [[Look North]] the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'', [[Calendar (News)|Calendar]] and [[BBC Radio Leeds]] to cover it locally.
