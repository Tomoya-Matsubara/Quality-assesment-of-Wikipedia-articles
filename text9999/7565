'''''Ambondro''''' is a [[genus]] of [[mammal]] from the [[middle Jurassic]] (about 167 million years ago) of [[Madagascar]]. The single species, '''''A. mahabo''''', is known from a fragmentary [[mandible|lower jaw]] with three teeth, interpreted as the last [[premolar]] and the first two [[molar (tooth)|molars]]. The premolar consists of a central [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] with one or two smaller cusps and a [[cingulum (dentistry)|cingulum]] (shelf) on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth. The molars also have such a lingual cingulum. They consist of two groups of cusps: a [[trigonid]] of three cusps at the front and a [[talonid]] with a main cusp, a smaller cusp, and a crest at the back. Features of the talonid suggest that ''Ambondro'' had [[tribosphenic molar]]s, the basic arrangement of molar features also present in [[marsupial]] and [[placental]] mammals. The oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth, it is about 25 million years older than the oldest previously known mammal with such teeth.

Upon its description in 1999, ''Ambondro'' was interpreted as a primitive relative of [[Tribosphenida]] (marsupials, placentals, and their extinct tribosphenic-toothed relatives). In 2001, however, an alternative suggestion was published that united it with the [[Cretaceous]] Australian ''[[Ausktribosphenos]]'' and the [[monotreme]]s (the [[echidna]]s, the [[platypus]], and their extinct relatives) into the clade [[Australosphenida]], which would have acquired tribosphenic molars independently from marsupials and placentals. The Jurassic Argentinean ''[[Asfaltomylos]]'' and ''[[Henosferus]]'' and the Cretaceous Australian ''[[Bishops whitmorei|Bishops]]'' were later added to Australosphenida, and new work on wear in australosphenidan teeth has called into question whether these animals, including ''Ambondro'', did in fact have tribosphenic teeth. Other paleontologists have challenged this concept of Australosphenida, and instead proposed that ''Ambondro'' is not closely related to ''Ausktribosphenos'' plus monotremes, or that monotremes are not australosphenidans and that the remaining australosphenidans are related to placentals.

==Discovery and context==
''Ambondro mahabo'' was described by a team led by John Flynn in a 1999 paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. The scientific name derives from the village of [[Ambondromahabo]], close to which the fossil was found. It is known from the [[Bathonian]] ([[middle Jurassic]], about 167 million years ago) of the [[Mahajanga Basin]] in northwestern Madagascar, in the Isalo III unit, the youngest of the three rock layers that make up the Isalo "[[Group (stratigraphy)|Group]]". This unit has also yielded [[crocodyliform]] and [[plesiosaur]] teeth and remains of the sauropod ''[[Lapparentosaurus]]''.<ref>Flynn et al., 1999, pp.&nbsp;57<U+2013>58</ref>

==Description==

''Ambondro'' was described on the basis of a fragmentary right [[mandible]] (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last [[premolar]] (p-last) and the first two [[molar (tooth)|molars]] (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the [[University of Antananarivo]] as specimen UA&nbsp;10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent [[cingulum (dentistry)|cingulum]] (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side.<ref name=Fea58>Flynn et al., 1999, p.&nbsp;58</ref> The p-last has a strong central [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of [[symmetrodont]]s, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the [[metaconid]] of symmetrodonts.<ref name=Feaf3>Flynn et al., 1999, fig.&nbsp;3</ref>

The front half of the m1 and m2 consists of the [[trigonid]], a group of three cusps forming a triangle: the [[paraconid]] at the front on the inner side, [[protoconid]] in the middle on the outer (labial) side, and [[metaconid]] at the back on the inner side (see Figure 2). The three cusps form a right angle with each other at the protoconid, so that the trigonid is described as "open".<ref name=Fea58/> The paraconid is higher than the metaconid.<ref name=Rea167>Rauhut et al., 2002, p.&nbsp;167</ref> At the front margin, a cingulum is present that is divided into two small cusps.<ref name=SRea146/> Unlike in various early tribosphenic mammals and close relatives, there is no additional cuspule behind the metaconid.<ref name=Feaf2>Flynn et al., 1999, fig.&nbsp;2</ref> At the back of the trigonid, the crest known as the [[distal metacristid]] is located relatively close to the outer side of the tooth and is continuous with another crest, the [[cristid obliqua]], which is in turn connected to the back of the tooth.<ref name=Fea58/>

The [[talonid]], another group of cusps, makes up the back of the tooth. It is wider than long<ref name=Rea167/> and contains a well-developed cusp, the [[hypoconid]], on the outer side and a depression, the [[talonid basin]], in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller [[hypoconulid]] cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by a cutting edge which is suggestive of the presence of a [[metacone]] cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the [[entocristid]], rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is swollen and on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct [[entoconid]] cusp is absent.<ref name=Fea58/> This entocristid is continuous with the lingual cingulum.<ref name=Feaf3/>

[[Wear facet]]s are areas of a tooth that show evidence of contact with a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]]).<ref>Luo et al., 2002, pp.&nbsp;22, 29</ref> Flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at the front and back margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest the presence of a [[protocone]] (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars.<ref name=Fea59>Flynn et al., 1999, p.&nbsp;59</ref> In a 2005 paper on ''[[Asfaltomylos]]'', a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in ''Ambondro'' and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.<ref name=MR422-3>Martin and Rauhut, 2005, pp.&nbsp;422<U+2013>423</ref>

In their paper, Flynn and colleagues described ''Ambondro'' as the oldest mammal with [[tribosphenic molar]]s<U+2014>the basic molar type of [[metatheria]]n ([[marsupial]]s and their extinct relatives) and [[eutheria]]n ([[placental]]s and their extinct relatives) mammals, characterized by the protocone cusp on the upper molars contacting the talonid basin on the lower molars in chewing. The discovery of ''Ambondro'' was thought to extend the known temporal range of tribosphenic mammals by 25 million years into the past.<ref>Flynn et al., 1999, p.&nbsp;57; Rougier et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;23</ref> Consequently, Flynn and colleagues argued against the prevailing view that tribosphenic mammals originated on the northern continents ([[Laurasia]]), and instead proposed that their origin lies in the south ([[Gondwana]]).<ref name=Fea60>Flynn et al., 1999, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They cited the retention of a distal metacristid and an "open" trigonid as characters separating ''Ambondro'' from more modern tribosphenidans.<ref name=Fea58/>

In 2001, [[Zhe-Xi Luo]] and colleagues alternatively proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)<U+2014>once giving rise to the marsupials and placentals ([[Boreosphenida]]), and once producing ''Ambondro'', the Cretaceous Australian ''[[Ausktribosphenos]]'', and the living [[monotreme]]s, which first appeared in the Cretaceous (united as [[Australosphenida]]).<ref>Luo et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;56</ref> They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.<ref>Luo et al., 2001, pp.&nbsp;53, 56</ref>

Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell and colleagues in their description of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, ''[[Tribactonodon]]'', agreed with the relationship between ''Ausktribosphenos'' and monotremes, but argued that ''Ambondro'' was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to ''Ausktribosphenos'' and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in ''Ambondro'' as well as some boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in ''Ambondro'' (flat) and ''Ausktribosphenos'' (squared); and the contrast between the talonids of ''Ambondro'' (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and ''Ausktribosphenos'' (squared).<ref name=SRea146>Sigogneau-Russell et al., 2001, p.&nbsp;146</ref>

The next year, Luo and colleagues published a more thorough analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian ''[[Bishops whitmorei|Bishops]]'' to Australosphenida.<ref>Luo et al., 2002, fig.&nbsp;1</ref> They mentioned the condition of the hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character<ref>Luo et al., 2002, p.&nbsp;23</ref> and noted that ''Ausktribosphenos'' and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of ''Ambondro'', by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the distal metacristid.<ref>Luo et al., 2002, p.&nbsp;22</ref> In the same year, ''Asfaltomylos'' was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to ''Ambondro'', this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.<ref>Rauhut et al., 2002, p.&nbsp;166</ref>

However, in 2003 Michael Woodburne and colleagues revised the [[cladistics|phylogenetic analysis]] published by Luo and colleagues, making several changes to the data, particularly in the monotremes.<ref>Woodburne, 2003, pp.&nbsp;233<U+2013>235</ref> Their results (Figure 3, bottom) challenged the division between Australosphenida and Boreosphenida, as proposed by Luo et al. Instead, they excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to Eutheria, with ''Ambondro'' most closely related to ''Asfaltomylos''.<ref>Woodburne, 2003, fig.&nbsp;5; Woodburne et al., 2003, fig.&nbsp;3</ref> In 2007, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described another australosphenidan, ''[[Henosferus]]'', from the Jurassic of Argentina; they argued against a relationship between Eutheria and Australosphenida (Figure 3, top), but were ambivalent about the placement of monotremes within Australosphenida.<ref>Rougier et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;31</ref> Based in part on Martin and Rauhut's earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans, they questioned the presence of a true functional protocone on the upper molars of non-monotreme australosphenidans<U+2014>none of which are known from upper teeth<U+2014>and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not, after all, have had truly tribosphenic teeth.<ref>Rougier et al., 2007, pp.&nbsp;24<U+2013>25</ref>
