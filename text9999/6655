'''[[Same-sex marriage]]s''' are not performed in the state of [[New Mexico]], which also does not provide [[civil union]]s or [[domestic partnership]]s. Its marriage laws do not explicitly permit or prohibit same-sex marriage and do not recognize such marriages established in other jurisdictions.

A June 2011 [[Public Policy Polling]] survey found that 68% of New Mexico voters supported legal recognition of same-sex couples.<ref name="PPP">http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_NM_705.pdf</ref>

==Law==

The definition of marriage and the validity of out-of-state marriages are given as follows in New Mexico Statutes <U+00A7>40-1 and <U+00A7>40-4.
* ''Marriage is contemplated by the law as a civil contract, for which the consent of the contracting parties, capable in law of contracting, is essential. ''<ref name=conway>{{cite web|author=NextPage - LivePublish |url=http://www.conwaygreene.com/nmsu/lpext.dll?f=templates&fn=main-hit-h.htm&2.0 |title=New Mexico Compilation Commission - Search Statutes, Rules and Decisions |publisher=Conwaygreene.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21 }}</ref>
* ''All marriages celebrated beyond the limits of this state, which are valid according to the laws of the country wherein they were celebrated or contracted, shall be likewise valid in this state, and shall have the same force as if they had been celebrated in accordance with the laws in force in this state. ''<ref name=conway />

Advocacy group Freedom to Marry summarizes the legal situation as of early 2011 this way:<ref>{{cite web|last=Freedom to Marry|title=New Mexico|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/entry/c/new-mexico|publisher=Freedomtomarry.org|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>
<blockquote>Because New Mexico<U+2019>s laws do not prohibit marriage between same-sex couples, there is no impediment to New Mexico same-sex couples marrying in [[Same-sex_marriage_in_Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] (or other jurisdictions that provide equality) and having their marriage honored in New Mexico.  While Massachusetts' government directed that licenses could be given to New Mexico couples, the New Mexico state government has not taken action to ensure they will be honored.</blockquote>

===Recognition of out-of-state marriages===

On January 4, 2011, New Mexico Attorney General [[Gary King (politician)|Gary K. King]] issued an opinion in response to a formal inquiry by State Representative [[Al Park]], who asked, "Are same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions valid in New Mexico?"

The Attorney General stated his conclusion thus:<ref>{{cite web|last=Democracy for New Mexico|title=Attorney General Gary King Issues Opinion Supporting Recognition of Out-of-State Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.democracyfornewmexico.com/democracy_for_new_mexico/2011/01/attorney-general-gary-king-issues-opinion-supporting-recognition-of-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.html|publisher=Democracyfornewmexico.com|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>
<blockquote>While we cannot predict how a New Mexico court would rule on this issue, after review of the law in this area, it is our opinion that a same-sex marriage that is valid under the laws of the country or state where it was consummated would likewise be found valid in New Mexico.</blockquote>

And in a press release issued the same day, King said:  "A comprehensive legal analysis by my office concludes that valid same-sex marriages in other states would likely be valid in New Mexico."<ref>{{cite web|last=Democracy for New Mexico|title=Attorney General Gary King Issues Opinion Supporting Recognition of Out-of-State Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.democracyfornewmexico.com/democracy_for_new_mexico/2011/01/attorney-general-gary-king-issues-opinion-supporting-recognition-of-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.html|publisher=Democracyfornewmexico.com|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>

However, it remains to be seen whether New Mexico courts or the state legislature will affirm the Attorney General's opinion, which does not have the force of law.  A spokesman for Republican Governor [[Susana Martinez]] responded to the opinion by saying, "Gov. Martinez made it clear during the campaign that she opposes same-sex marriage. It's important to note that no New Mexico court has ruled on this issue."

==History==
===2004===

On February 20, 2004, at the time of the widely publicized [[San Francisco 2004 same-sex weddings|same-sex weddings in San Francisco]], [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]] [[County clerk|clerk]] Victoria Dunlap, a married [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] with two children,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521848565&ss=exc |title=America's Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage - Cambridge University Press |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> began issuing [[marriage license]]s to same-sex couples, claiming legal justification for her action because New Mexico marriage law does not mention gender.  As reported by the ''Albuquerque Journal'', "[Dunlap] said she sought an opinion from her county attorney after she got a call earlier this week from someone asking about same-sex ceremonies. 'This has nothing to do with politics or morals, [she said].  If there are no legal grounds that say this should be prohibited, I can't withhold it . . . This office won't say no until shown it's not permissible.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/state/apwed02-20-04.htm |title=Same-Sex Couples Line Up in Sandoval County To Get Married |publisher=Albuquerque Journal |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

The Sandoval County courthouse was quickly thronged by same-sex couples applying for marriage licenses as the story was broadcast nationwide by the news media.<ref name="sandovalsignpost1">{{cite web|url=http://www.sandovalsignpost.com/mar04/html/up_front.html |title=Up Front |publisher=Sandoval Signpost |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> The number of marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples was reported by various news sources as 64, 66, 67, or 68, but a suit filed against Dunlap in July by the attorney general states 66 licenses were issued, and further states that by March 23, 64 of the couples had married "as evidenced by the return and filing of licenses and Certificates of Marriage."<ref>[http://www.domawatch.com/cases/newmexico/newmexicovdunlap/040729MotionToDismiss.pdf Motion to Dismiss, State of New Mexico v. Victoria Dunlap]</ref>
The same number of 66 licenses issued is stated in Dunlap's own motion filed with the [[Supreme Court of New Mexico]].<ref name=mandamus>http://www.domawatch.com/cases/newmexico/dunlapvmadrid/040609PetitionForWritOfMandamus.pdf</ref> News reports stated that 26 couples had been married on the courthouse steps on February 20 by two local ministers who showed up to conduct the ceremonies.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/02/21/NM.TMP | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Gay unions in New Mexico / But state forces county clerk to stop | first=Rona | last=Marech | date=February 20, 2004}}</ref>

By the end of the day, however, New Mexico state attorney general [[Patricia Madrid]] issued an opinion stating that the licenses were "invalid under state law",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/1524.htm |title=New Mexico Marriage/Relationship Recognition Law |publisher=HRC |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref><ref name=mandamus /> and the Sandoval County clerk's office stopped issuing them at 4:15 pm that same day. 

A district court judge later issued a restraining order against Dunlap, prohibiting her from issuing any further licenses to same-sex couples.  Dunlap then filed a motion with the state supreme court for permission to continue issuing the licenses, but on July 8, 2004, the supreme court rejected the motion.  The restraining order was never lifted,<ref name="abqjournal2005">{{cite web|last=Akers |first=Joshua |url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/xgr/2005/307454xgr02-20-05.htm |title=N.M.

===2007===

On July 13, 2007, a change in state policy in [[same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]]<ref>{{cite news | title = Same-sex couples from NM allowed to marry in MA |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/07/27/same_sex_couples_from_nm_allowed_to_marry_in_mass/ | accessdate = 26 December 2007 | work=The Boston Globe | date=July 27, 2007 | first1=David | last1=Abel}}</ref> (the only state in the United States at that time where same-sex marriages could be performed) allowed officials of that state to marry couples from states such as New Mexico which have no specific prohibition against same-sex marriage.<ref name=aclu>{{cite web|url=http://aclu-nm.org/News_Events/news_7_26_07.html |title=Civil Rights Groups Hail Massachusetts Decision Allowing NM Same-Sex Couples to Marry |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

New Mexican same-sex couples were already able to marry in such countries as [[same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], where the laws of the state or country of origin of the couple are not an issue, and by mid-2008, same-sex couples were able to marry in both Massachusetts and [[Same-sex marriage in California|California]] without regard to the laws of their state of residence.  (However, under the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]], other states are not obliged to recognize any same-sex marriages, and same-sex couples who married were still not entitled to any federal benefits or recognition.)

According to civil-rights organization Freedom to Marry, "the New Mexico state government has not taken action to ensure [same-sex marriages] will be honored."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/new_mexico.php |title=Freedom to Marry |publisher=Freedom to Marry |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> In a press release on July 27, 2007, the [[ACLU]] of New Mexico cautioned that "while we have made tremendous progress in persuading the state that it's unfair to deny same-sex couples legal protections for their families, we still have a ways to go before we can expect the state to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples."<ref name=aclu />

===2008===

* In January 2008, a domestic partnership bill, HB 9,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legis.state.nm.us/Sessions/08%20Regular/bills/house/HB0009.html |title=Text of House Bill 9}}</ref> advocated by governor [[Bill Richardson]] as part of his legislative agenda,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/ci_8220325 |title=Committee tables Gov.'s domestic partnership plan |publisher=Las Cruces Sun-News |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> passed the state's House by a 33 to 31 vote and was sent to the state Senate, which took no action on it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid51837.asp |title=New Mexico House Passes Domestic-Partnership Bill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dchieftain.com/news/77412-01-26-08.html |title=Bill for domestic partner rights passes through New Mexico House of Representatives}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://angelcitysdevil.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=358&Itemid=2 |title=New Mexico Closer to Domestic Partnerships}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2008/01/25/5 |title=New Mexico House passes partner bill}}</ref>  A similar bill had been defeated in the 2007 legislature.

* House Bill 47, providing that marriage may only be between a man and a woman, and House Joint Resolution 3, proposing a constitutional amendment to define marriage as being between a man and a woman, both died when the legislature adjourned on February 14, 2008, without acting on them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/laws_and_elections/state_legislation_listing.asp?state=New+Mexico&btnG.x=12&btnG.y=8 |title=State Legislation Listing |publisher=HRC |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

===2009===
On February 27, 2009, [[domestic partnership]] legislation that would grant both [[same-sex couples]] and opposite-sex couples many of the same rights found in a state [[marriage]] was voted down in the State Senate by a 25-17 margin, with 10 Democrats and 15 Republicans opposing the legislation. Supported by [[Governor]] [[Bill Richardson]], supporters vowed to take up the issue again sometime later in 2009.<ref>[http://newmexicoindependent.com/20005/domestic-partnerships-bill-fails-by-8-vote-margin Domestic partnerships bill fails by 8-vote margin]</ref>

===2010===

* On February 15, 2010, a domestic partnership bill sponsored by Senator Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) was defeated in a senate committee, "[striking] a blow to Gov. [[Bill Richardson]] who made extending many of the same rights enjoyed by married couples to gays and lesbians part of his legislative agenda."<ref>{{cite news|title=Domestic partnerships done for 2010 but will be back, supporters say|url=http://newmexicoindependent.com/47693/domestic-partnerships-done-for-2010-but-will-be-back-supporters-say|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=New Mexico Independent|date=February 15, 2010}}</ref>

* A proposed amendment to the state constitution sponsored by Senator William Sharer (R-Farmington) that would have limited marriage to opposite-sex couples was also defeated in this legislative session by another Senate committee.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anti-gay-marriage bill dies in committee|url=http://newmexicoindependent.com/47594/anti-gay-marriage-bill-dies-in-committee#|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=New Mexico Independent|date=February 15, 2010}}</ref>

* On August 9, 2010, after a same-sex couple who were married in Sandoval County (see above) filed for divorce in Santa Fe, State District Judge Sarah Singleton ruled that the marriage license issued to them in 2004 had indeed been valid, and thus the dissolution of their marriage was subject to divorce proceedings in court. According to the Santa Fe ''New Mexican'':<ref>{{cite news|last=Sharpe|first=Tom|title=Judge: No easy way out for same-sex couple|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Story/Judge-affirms-same-sex-marriages#|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=Santa Fe New Mexican|date=August 9, 2010}}</ref>
<blockquote>Singleton avoided the broader issue of whether gay marriage is legal in New Mexico, but stuck to the issue of whether the gay marriage licenses were invalid from the beginning, or could be declared invalid later. Dunlap may have been negligent or mistaken, Singleton said, but the licenses she issued are "not [[Void (law)|void]] from the  inception, but merely [[voidable]]." The judge said that under state statutes, the only type of marriage that might be void from the beginning would be an incestuous one. Dunlap's same-sex marriage licenses were never invalidated because the matter was never litigated to its conclusion after former Attorney General Patricia Madrid persuaded Dunlap to stop issuing them.</blockquote>
Whether this ruling will have any broader effect on same-sex unions in the state has yet to be determined.<ref>http://www.leagle.com/unsecure/news.do?feed=yellowbrix&storyid=148284535</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S1690587.shtml?cat=500 |title=NM judge rules same-sex marriage license valid |publisher=KOB.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

==Economic Effects==
In 2006, a study by the Williams Institute at the [[UCLA School of Law]] concluded that allowing same-sex couples to marry would have a positive effect on New Mexico<U+2019>s state budget. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would result in a net gain of approximately $1.5 million to $2 million each year for the State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/uclalaw/williams/badgett_8/ |title=eScholarship: The Impact on New Mexico's Budget of Allowing Same-Sex Coules to Marry |publisher=Repositories.cdlib.org |date=2006-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> This net impact will be the result of savings in expenditures on state means-tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.

==Demographics==

In April, 2008, the Williams Institute of the [[UCLA]] School of Law, using data from the [[United States Census Bureau]], issued a "Census Snapshot" that concluded, "While in many respects New Mexico<U+2019>s same-sex couples look like married couples, same-sex couples with children have fewer economic resources to provide for their families than married parents and lower rates of home ownership."<ref>[http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute//publications/NewMexicoCensusSnapshot.pdf New Mexico census snapshot]</ref>

Analyzing census data on same-sex "unmarried-partner" households, the report determined, among other things, that:

*In 2000, there were 4,496 same-sex couples living in New Mexico.  By 2005, the number of same-sex couples disclosing their partnerships to the census bureau had increased to 6,063.
*In 2005, there were an estimated 68,411 gay, lesbian, and bisexual people (single and coupled) living in New Mexico.
*There are more female same-sex couples (58%) than male same-sex couples (42%) in New Mexico.
*Individuals in same-sex couples are, on average, 42 years old, and significantly younger than individuals in married couples (48 years old) in New Mexico.
*Same-sex couples live in every county in New Mexico and constitute 1.2% of coupled households and 0.7% of all households in the state.
*71% of individuals in same-sex couples are employed, compared to 60% of married individuals.
*The average household income of same-sex couples is $53,720, compared to $59,692 for married couples. The median income of both same-sex and married coupled households in New Mexico is $47,000.
*66% of same-sex couples in New Mexico own their home, compared to 83% of married couples.
*27% of same-sex couples in New Mexico are raising children under the age of 18.
*As of 2005, an estimated 3,624 of New Mexico<U+2019>s children were living in households headed by same-sex couples.
*9% of New Mexico<U+2019>s adopted children (or 1,056 children) live with a lesbian or gay parent.

==Public opinion==

A June 2011 [[Public Policy Polling]] survey found that 42% of New Mexico voters thought that same-sex marriage should be legal, while 48% thought it should be illegal and 10% were not sure. A separate question in the same survey found that 68% of New Mexico voters supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 37% supporting same-sex marriage, 31% supporting civil unions, 30% opposing all legal recognition, and 2% not sure.<ref name="PPP"/>
