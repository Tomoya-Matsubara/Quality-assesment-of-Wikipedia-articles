==Storylines==
===Background===
Nick was raised in Erinsborough by his grandmother, after being orphaned at age 8 and had a relatively normal life until his grandmother began suffering from [[Alzheimer's]] and Nick was forced to care for her and look after himself as well. Nick began to slide off the rails, taking his anger out on the world.

===1988-1990===
Nick is first seen as the culprit who graffities [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]]'s fence at his workshop. When [[Henry Ramsay]] spots Nick, he runs off. A week later, Henry and Jim's Nephew, [[Todd Landers]] set a trap to catch Nick, which works when he tries to spray the fence again. After being caught, Nick pleads with Jim not to phone the police as it would kill his grandmother. Jim's mother-in-law, [[Helen Daniels]] decides to give Nick the benefit of the doubt and suggests that he paint over his handiwork. Nick rejects Helen's offer as art classes and sees it as form of charity but eventually relents. When Nick accepts Helen's  offer of a room at Number 26, Jim and Todd are both initially resistant but eventually grow to accept Nick and support him after his grandmother dies. 

Nick begins a romance with newly-arrived [[Sharon Davies (Neighbours)|Sharon Davies]] and they begin dating much to the chagrin of Sharon's stern aunt Edie. On the night of the school dance, Nick finds himself in a brawl with Bruce Zadro, who hassles Sharon. This results in Nick getting a black eye. Nick stands trial for a prior graffiti offence the following day and the magistrate spots his black eye. Helen and Sharon are quick to defend him and Nick is sentenced to 30 hours [[Community Service]]. When Sharon burns the Coffee Shop down after discarding a cigarrette, Nick agrees to take the blame. Sharon later confesses to [[Harold Bishop]] that she was the culprit.

Nick finds himself afoul of the law once again when he tries to stop Todd and Skinner, a criminal who he met on the streets, from committing a raid on a warehouse, which results in Nick's arrest. Todd confesses that Skinner was the real criminal and Nick is freed. When Skinner menaces Todd and his sister Katie, Nick is quick to help apprehend him when he tries to flee.

Nick faces more problems when Zadro reappears and frames him for spray-painting Principal Kenneth Muir's car and the school, resulting in expulsion for Nick. After a cunning plan by Sharon to extract a confession from Zadro, which is heard over the PA system, Muir reinstates Nick at Erinsborough High. Nick, however refuses to go back and drops out. Later, when Hilary Robinson (who Edie asked to keep an eye on Sharon) bans Nick from seeing Sharon, the couple run away from Erinsborough and begin work on a farm. When Sharon fights with the farmer's daughter, they are sacked and begin hitch-hiking back to Erinsborough. While hitching a lift, Nick comes face to face with Skinner, who pushes Nick out of the car and drives away with Sharon.

After arriving home, Nick tries to warn Sharon about Skinner who she begins dating. After Skinner attempts to force himself on Sharon's older sister, Bronwyn, Sharon realizes Nick is right. Nick and Sharon split up later and remain friends. Hilary's son, Matt arrives from Adelaide and joins Nick and Sharon in their antics.

Nick suffers a fall one afternoon and hits his head on the side of the pool at Number 30. Shortly after, He begins experiencing aggressive moods swings. When Jim confronts him about his behavior he collapses and is diagnosed with [[meningitis]] caused by the skull fracture.
Soon after, Nick begins dating Lucy, Jim's daughter who arrives home from boarding school for the holidays. Jim is unimpressed when he finds out that Nick and Lucy are at The Waterhole as they are underage. Nick and Lucy's relationship eventually fizzles out when she goes back to boarding school.

In early 1990, Nick receives a chance to take up an art scholarship in [[London]] and is successful. Before leaving, He presents paintings for the people who mean the most to him (Jim, Beverly, Helen and Sharon). Several months after settling in London, Nick corresponds with Helen via postcard telling her about how he has fallen in love with an English girl and his art comes second.
