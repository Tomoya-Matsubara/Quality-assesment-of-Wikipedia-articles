'''SMS ''Bayern''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''[[Bavaria]]''")<ref group=Note>"SMS" stands for "''[[Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t Schiff]]''", or "His Majesty's Ship"</ref> was the lead ship of the {{sclass|Bayern|battleship|5}} class of [[battleship]]s in the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Imperial Navy]]. The vessel was launched in February 1915 and entered service in July 1916, too late to take part in the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Her main armament consisted of eight 38&nbsp;cm (15&nbsp;in) guns in four turrets, which was a significant improvement over the preceding {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|5}}'s ten 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;inch) guns.{{#tag:ref|The 38&nbsp;cm gun fired a {{convert|750|kg|adj=on}} shell while the 30.5&nbsp;cm gun fired a {{convert|405|kg|abbr=on}} shell. ''Bayern'' had a [[broadside]] weight of {{convert|6000|kg|abbr=on}} with all eight guns while ''K<U+00F6>nig''{{'}}s ten guns had a broadside weight of {{convert|4050|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 140</ref>|group=Note}} The ship was to have formed the nucleus for a fourth battle squadron in the [[High Seas Fleet]], along with three of her [[sister ship]]s. However, only one of the other ships&mdash;{{SMS|Baden|1915|2}}&mdash;was completed; the other two were canceled later in the war when production requirements shifted to [[U-boat]] construction.

As she had been commissioned late in the war, ''Bayern'' had a limited service career. The first operation in which the ship took part was an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea on 18&ndash;19 August 1916, just a month after she had been commissioned. The ship also participated in [[Operation Albion]] in the [[Gulf of Riga]], but shortly after the German attack began on 12 October 1917, ''Bayern'' was mined and had to be withdrawn for repairs. She was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet in [[Scapa Flow]] in November 1918 following the end of [[World War I]]. On 21 June 1919, Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]] ordered the fleet to be scuttled; ''Bayern'' sank at 14:30. In September 1934, the ship was raised and towed to [[Rosyth]], where she was scrapped.

==Construction==
''Bayern'' was ordered with the provisional name "T" in 1912,<ref name="Groner28">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 28</ref> under the fourth and final [[German Naval Laws|Naval Law]], which was passed that year.<ref>Herwig, p. 81</ref> Work began at the [[Howaldtswerke]] Dockyard in [[Kiel]] under construction number 590. The ship was laid down in 1913 and launched on 18 February 1915. After [[fitting-out]] and sea trials, the ship was commissioned into service on 15 July 1916, a month and a half too late for her to participate in the [[Battle of Jutland]]. She had cost the Imperial German Government 49 million [[German gold mark|Goldmarks]].<ref name="Groner28"/> ''Bayern'' would later be joined in service by one sister ship, {{SMS|Baden|1915|2}}. Two other ships of this class, ''Sachsen'' and ''W<U+00FC>rttemberg'', were canceled before they were completed.<ref name="Groner30">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 30</ref>

[[File:SMS-Bayern-protection-scheme-EN.svg|thumb|left|400px|Armor layout for ''Bayern''; the numbers represent the armor thickness in millimeters in each area.]]

''Bayern'' was {{convert|179.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]], and an even {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|30|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of 9.3&ndash;9.4&nbsp;m (30.5&ndash;30.8&nbsp;ft). ''Bayern'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|28530|MT|lk=on|sp=us}} at a normal displacement; at full combat load, she displaced up to {{convert|32200|MT|abbr=on}}. ''Bayern'' was powered by three [[C. A. Parsons and Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s rated at {{convert|35,000|shp|lk=on}} and three oil-fired and eleven coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft [[Water-tube boiler|boilers]], and on trials achieved {{convert|55967|shp|abbr=on}}; she had a maximum speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=on}}.<ref name="Groner28"/>{{#tag:ref|Parsons operated a branch in Germany named Turbinia, which provided British-built turbines to the German navy, as well as commercial shipping companies.<ref>Weir, p. 95</ref>|group=Note}} The ship could carry up to {{convert|3400|MT|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|620|MT|abbr=on}} of [[fuel oil]], which provided a maximum range of {{convert|5000|nmi|abbr=on}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|12|kn|abbr=on}}.<ref>Staff, p. 40</ref>

The ship was the first German warship armed with eight 38&nbsp;cm (15&nbsp;in) guns. The primary battery guns were arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets each fore and aft.<ref>Hore, p. 70</ref> Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) guns, six 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45&nbsp;in) guns and five 60&nbsp;cm (23.6&nbsp;in) underwater [[torpedo]] tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Upon commissioning, she carried a crew of 42 [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and 1,129 [[enlisted men]].<ref name="Groner30"/>

==Service history==
''Bayern'' joined the III Battle Squadron of the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 15 July 1916, just two weeks after the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The ship would have been available for the operation,<ref name=S43>Staff, p. 43</ref> but the ship's crew, composed largely of the crew from the recently decommissioned battleship {{SMS|Lothringen||2}},<ref name=G41>Gr<U+00FC>tzner, p. 41</ref> was given leave.<ref name=S43>Staff, p. 43</ref> At the time of her commissioning, ''Bayern''{{'}}s commander was ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>n zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) Max Hahn. [[Ernst Lindemann]], who would go on to command the battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] during its only combat sortie during [[World War II]], served aboard the ship as a wireless operator.<ref name=G41/>
 
Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] planned a [[Action of 19 August 1916|fleet advance for 18&ndash;19&nbsp;August 1916]]; the operation consisted of a bombardment conducted by the [[I Scouting Group]]. This was an attempt to draw out and destroy Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]]'s battlecruisers. As {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} were the only two German battlecruisers still in fighting condition, three dreadnoughts were assigned to the unit for the operation: ''Bayern'' and the two {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|0}} ships {{SMS|Markgraf||2}} and {{SMS|Grosser Kurf<U+00FC>rst||2}}. Admiral Scheer and the rest of the [[High Seas Fleet]], including 15 dreadnoughts, were to trail behind and provide cover.<ref>Massie, p. 682</ref> The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the [[Grand Fleet]] to meet them. By 14:35,{{#tag:ref|The times mentioned in this article are in [[Central European Time|CET]], which is congruent with the German perspective. This is one hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], the time zone commonly used in British works.|group=Note}} Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11&nbsp;weeks after the decidedly close call at [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]], turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.<ref>Massie, p. 683</ref> Another sortie into the North Sea followed on 18&ndash;20 October, though the German fleet again encountered no British naval forces.<ref name=S43/>

===Operation Albion===
{{Main|Operation Albion}}
[[File:SMS Bayern.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing of ''Bayern'']]
In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to evict the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. To this end, the ''Admiralstab'' (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic islands of [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]], particularly the Russian gun batteries on the [[S<U+00F5>rve Peninsula|Sworbe peninsula]].<ref>Halpern, p. 213</ref> On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint Army-Navy operation to capture <U+00D6>sel and [[Muhu|Moon]] islands; the primary naval component consisted of the [[flagship]]  {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} and the III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. At this time, the V Division included the ''Bayern'' and four {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|1}}s. The VI Division consisted of the five {{sclass|Kaiser|battleship|1}}s. Along with 9 light cruisers, 3 torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of [[naval mine|mine]] warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and 6 [[zeppelin]]s. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Halpern, pp. 214&ndash;215</ref> Opposing the Germans were the old Russian [[pre-dreadnought]]s [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] and [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Tsarevitch'']], the [[armored cruiser]]s [[Russian cruiser Bayan (1907)|''Bayan'']], [[Russian cruiser Admiral Makarov (1906)|''Admiral Makarov'']], and [[Russian cruiser Diana (1899)|''Diana'']], 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on <U+00D6>sel numbered some 14,000 men.<ref name="Halpern215">Halpern, p. 215</ref>

The operation began on 12 October, when ''Bayern'', along with ''Moltke'' and the four ''K<U+00F6>nig''s, began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Simultaneously, the five ''Kaiser''s engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and [[Hiiumaa|Dag<U+00F6>]] islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the gulf. ''Bayern''{{'s}} role in the operation was cut short when she struck a [[naval mine]] at 5:07 while moving into her bombardment position at Pamerort.<ref name="Halpern215"/> The mine explosion killed one ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' and six sailors, allowed {{convert|1000|MT|sp=us}} of water into the ship and caused the [[forecastle]] to sink by {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=S43/><ref name=G4851>Gr<U+00FC>tzner, pp. 48<U+2013>51.</ref> Despite the damage inflicted by the mine, ''Bayern'' engaged the naval battery at Cape Toffri on the southern tip of Hiiumaa. ''Bayern'' was released from her position at 14:00. Preliminary repairs were made on 13 October in Tagga Bay.<ref name=G4851/> The temporary repairs proved ineffective, and ''Bayern'' had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs; the return trip took 19 days.<ref name="Halpern215"/> Repairs lasted from 3 November to 27 December,<ref name=S43/> during which the forward torpedo tube room was stripped of its equipment and the torpedo ports were sealed. The room was then turned into an additional [[watertight compartment]].<ref name="Groner30"/> Four {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft guns were also installed during the repairs process.<ref name=S43/>

On 16 October, two ''K<U+00F6>nig'' class battleships and a number of smaller vessels were sent to engage the Russian battleships in the Gulf of Riga. The following day, {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig||2}} and {{SMS|Kronprinz|1914|2}} engaged the Russian battleships&mdash;''K<U+00F6>nig'' dueled with ''Slava'' and ''Kronprinz'' fired on both ''Slava'' and the cruiser ''Bayan''. The Russian vessels were hit dozens of times, until at 10:30 the Russian naval commander, [[Mikhail Bakhirev|Admiral Bakhirev]],  ordered their withdrawal. ''Slava'' had taken too much damage, and was unable to make good her escape; instead, she was scuttled and her crew was evacuated on a destroyer.<ref>Halpern, p. 218</ref> By 20 October, the naval operations were effectively over; the Russian fleet had been destroyed or forced to withdraw, and the German army held the islands in the gulf.<ref>Halpern, p. 219</ref>

===Subsequent operations===
Following her return to the fleet, ''Bayern'' was assigned to security duties in the North Sea.<ref name=S43/> Admiral Scheer had used light surface forces to attack British convoys to Norway beginning in late 1917. As a result, the Royal Navy attached a squadron of battleships to protect the convoys, which presented Scheer with the possibility of destroying a detached squadron of the Grand Fleet. Scheer remarked that "A successful attack on such a convoy would not only result in the sinking of much tonnage, but would be a great military success, and would ... force the English to send more warships to the northern waters."<ref name=H418/> Scheer instituted strict wireless silence in preparation for the planned attack. This denied the British the ability to intercept and decrypt German signals, which had previously been a significant advantage. The operation called for Hipper's battlecruisers to attack the convoy and its escorts on 23 April while the battleships of the High Seas Fleet stood by in support. On 22 April, ''Bayern'' and the rest of the German fleet assembled in the [[Schillig Roads]] outside Wilhelmshaven and departed the following morning at 06:00. Heavy fog, however, forced the Germans to remain inside their defensive minefields for half an hour.<ref name=H418>Halpern, p. 418</ref> 

Hipper's forces were some {{convert|60|nmi|abbr=on}} west of [[Eger<U+00F6>]], Norway, by 05:20 on the 24th. Despite the success in reaching the convoy route undetected, the operation failed due to faulty intelligence. Reports from U-boats indicated to Scheer that the convoys sailed at the start and middle of each week, but a west-bound convoy had left [[Bergen]] on Tuesday the 22nd and an east-bound group left [[Methil]], Scotland, on the 24th, a Thursday. As a result, there was no convoy for Hipper to attack.<ref name=H419>Halpern, p. 419</ref>

The same day, one of ''Moltke''{{'s}} [[screw propeller|screws]] slipped off, which caused serious damage to the power plant and allowed some {{convert|2000|MT|sp=us}} of water into the ship. ''Moltke'' was forced to break radio silence in order to inform Scheer of the ship's condition, which alerted the Royal Navy to the High Seas Fleet's activities.<ref name=H419/> Beatty sortied with a force of 31 battleships and four battlecruisers, but was too late to intercept the retreating Germans. The Germans reached their defensive minefields early on 25 April, though approximately {{convert|40|nmi|abbr=on}} off [[Helgoland]] ''Moltke'' was torpedoed by the submarine {{HMS|E42||2}}. ''Moltke'' successfully returned to port.<ref>Halpern, p. 420</ref>

===Fate===
[[File:SMS Bayern sinking.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Bayern'' sinking in Scapa Flow]]

''Bayern'' was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the "death ride" of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from its base in [[Wilhelmshaven]] to engage the British Grand Fleet. [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]]&mdash;by now the ''[[Grand Admiral|Gro<U+00DF>admiral]]'' of the fleet&mdash;intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to obtain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 280&ndash;281</ref> While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began rioting.<ref name="Massie775">Massie, p. 775</ref> On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on several battleships [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]]; three ships from the III&nbsp;Squadron refused to weigh anchors, and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} and {{SMS|Helgoland||2}}. The order to sail was rescinded in the face of this open revolt.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 281&ndash;282</ref> In an attempt to suppress the mutiny, the battleship squadrons were dispersed.<ref name="Massie775"/>

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the majority of the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>Tarrant, p. 282</ref> ''Bayern'' was listed as one of the ships to be handed over. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the British [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Cardiff||2}}, before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow.<ref>Herwig, pp. 254&ndash;255</ref>

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Versailles Treaty]]. It became apparent to Reuter that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|Reuter ordered his ships to be sunk]]. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.<ref>Herwig, p. 256</ref>  ''Bayern'' sank at 14:30. The ship was raised on 1 September 1934 and was broken up the following year in [[Rosyth]]. The ship's bell was eventually delivered to the German [[German Navy|Federal Navy]] and is on display at Kiel F<U+00F6>rdeklub.<ref name="Groner30"/>{{#tag:ref|It is unknown when the bell was returned, but it is likely that it was sometime between the late 1950s and mid 1960s. The British government returned the bell from {{SMS|Hindenburg}} on 28 May 1959 and the bells from {{SMS|Derfflinger}} and {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|6}} on 30 August 1965.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 26, 57</ref>|group=Note}}
