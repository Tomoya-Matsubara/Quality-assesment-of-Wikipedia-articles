is a [[genus]] of [[diplodocid]] [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] whose [[fossil]]s were first discovered in 1877 by [[Samuel Wendell Williston|S. W. Williston]]. The generic name, coined by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1878, is a [[New Latin|Neo-Latin]] term derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{unicode|<U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03C0><U+03BB><U+03CC><U+03BF><U+03C2>}} (''diploos'') "double" and {{unicode|<U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}} (dokos) "beam",<ref name="oed"/> in reference to its double-beamed [[chevron (anatomy)|chevron bones]] located in the underside of the tail. These bones were initially believed to be unique to ''Diplodocus''; however, they have since then been discovered in other members of the [[diplodocid]] family and in non-diplodocid sauropods such as ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.

It lived in what is now western North America at the end of the [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. ''Diplodocus'' is one of the more common dinosaur fossils found in the Upper [[Morrison Formation]], a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments deposited about 155 to 148 [[mega-annum|million years ago]], in what is now termed the [[Kimmeridgian]] and [[Tithonian]] [[faunal stage|stages]] (''Diplodocus'' itself ranged from about 154 to 150 million years ago<ref name=turner1999>Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999).

''Diplodocus'' is among the most easily identifiable dinosaurs, with its classic dinosaur shape, long neck and tail and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'': their remains have been found in the same [[stratum|strata]], which suggests they coexisted with ''Diplodocus''.

==Description==
[[File:Longest dinosaurs1.png|thumb|left|Diagram showing the size of different sauropods compared to a human, ''D. hallorum'' in green]]
One of the best-known sauropods, ''Diplodocus''  was a very large long-necked [[quadruped]]al animal, with a long, whip-like tail. Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hind limbs, resulting in a largely horizontal posture. The long-necked, long-tailed animal with four sturdy legs has been mechanically compared with a suspension bridge.<ref name="UDB">Lambert D. (1993)''The Ultimate Dinosaur Book'' ISBN 0-86438-417-3</ref> In fact, ''Diplodocus'' is the longest dinosaur known from a complete skeleton.<ref name="UDB"/> The partial remains of ''D. hallorum'' have increased the estimated length, though not as much as previously thought; when first described in 1991, discoverer David Gillette calculated it may have been up to 54&nbsp;m (177&nbsp;ft) long, making it the longest known dinosaur (excluding those known from exceedingly poor remains, such as ''[[Amphicoelias]]''). Some weight estimates ranged as high as 113 [[ton]]s (125 US [[short tons]]). This review was based on recent findings that show that the giant tail vertebrae were actually placed further forward on the tail than Gillette originally calculated. The study shows that the complete ''Diplodocus'' skeleton at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], on which estimates of ''Seismosaurus'' were based, had its 13th tail vertebra come from another dinosaur, throwing size estimates for ''Seismosaurus'' off by up to 30%. While dinosaurs such as ''[[Supersaurus]]'' were probably longer, fossil remains of these animals are only fragmentary.<ref>Wedel, M.J. and Cifelli, R.L.

The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped bones on the underside, which gave ''Diplodocus'' its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.

Like other sauropods, the manus (front "feet") of ''Diplodocus'' were highly modified, with the finger and hand bones arranged into a vertical column, [[horseshoe]]-shaped in cross section. ''Diplodocus'' lacked claws on all but one digit of the front limb, and this claw was unusually large relative to other sauropods, flattened from side to side, and detached from the bones of the hand. The function of this unusually specialized claw is unknown.<ref name="bonnan2003">Bonnan, M. F. (2003).

==Discovery and species==

Several species of ''Diplodocus'' were described between 1878 and 1924. The first [[skeleton]] was found at [[Ca<U+00F1>on City]], [[Colorado]] by [[Benjamin Franklin Mudge|Benjamin Mudge]] and [[Samuel Wendell Williston]] in 1877, and was named ''Diplodocus longus'' ('long double-beam'), by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1878.<ref>Marsh OC. Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs. Part I. American Journal of Science 3; 411<U+2013>416 (1878).</ref>  ''Diplodocus'' remains have since been found in the [[Morrison Formation]] of the western U.S. States of [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]]. [[Fossil]]s of this animal are common, except for the [[skull]], which is often missing from otherwise complete skeletons. Although not the type species, ''D. carnegii'' is the most completely known and most famous due to the large number of casts of its skeleton in museums around the world.

The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera ''Diplodocus'' and ''Barosaurus'' had very similar limb bones. In the past, many isolated limb bones were automatically attributed to ''Diplodocus'' but may, in fact, have belonged to ''Barosaurus''.<ref>{{cite book|author=McIntosh|year=2005|chapter=The Genus Barosaurus ([[Othniel Charles Marsh|Marsh]])|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth and Tidswell, Virginia (ed.)|title=Thunder Lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs|pages=38&ndash;77|publisher= Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34542-1}}</ref> Fossil remains of ''Diplodocus'' have been recovered from stratigraphic zone 5 of the Morrison Formation.<ref name="foster-appendix">Foster, J.

==Paleobiology==
Due to a wealth of skeletal remains, ''Diplodocus'' is one of the best-studied dinosaurs. Many aspects of its lifestyle have been subjects of various theories over the years.

===Habitat===
Marsh and then Hatcher<ref>Hatcher JB. "''Diplodocus'' (Marsh): Its osteology, taxonomy, and probable habits, with a restoration of the skeleton,". Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum, vol. 1 (1901), pp. 1<U+2013>63</ref> assumed the animal was aquatic, because of the position of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods such as ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' and ''Apatosaurus''. However, a 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils when the rest of the body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great.<ref name="kermack">{{cite journal

===Posture===
[[File:Diplodocus by Hay 1910.jpg|thumb|An outmoded depiction by Oliver P. Hay (1910), with sprawled limbs<ref>Hay, O. P., 1910, Proceedings of the Washington Academy of Sciences, vol. 12,, pp. 1<U+2013>25</ref>]]
The depiction of ''Diplodocus'' posture has changed considerably over the years. For instance, a classic 1910 reconstruction by Oliver P. Hay depicts two ''Diplodocus'' with splayed lizard-like limbs on the banks of a river. Hay argued that ''Diplodocus'' had a sprawling, lizard-like gait with widely splayed legs,<ref>Hay, Dr. Oliver P., "On the Habits and Pose of the Sauropod Dinosaurs, especially of Diplodocus." The American Naturalist, Vol. XLII, Oct. 1908</ref> and was supported by [[Gustav Tornier]]. However, this hypothesis was contested by W. J. Holland, who demonstrated that a sprawling ''Diplodocus'' would have needed a trench to pull its belly through.<ref>Holland, Dr. W. J., "A Review of Some Recent Criticisms of the Restorations of Sauropod Dinosaurs Existing in the Museums of the United States, with Special Reference to that of Diplodocus carnegii in the Carnegie Museum", The American Naturalist, 44:259<U+2013>283. 1910.</ref> Finds of sauropod footprints in the 1930s eventually put Hay's theory to rest.
[[File:DiplodocusDB.jpg|left|thumb|A depiction of two ''D. longus'' with horizontal necks, flexible whip tails, keratinous spines and nostrils low on the snouts]]
Later, [[diplodocidae|diplodocids]] were often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including ''Diplodocus'' did not raise their heads much above shoulder level.<ref name="stevens05">{{cite book|author=Stevens KA, Parrish JM|year=2005|chapter=Neck Posture, Dentition and Feeding Strategies in Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth and Tidswell, Virginia (ed.)|title=Thunder Lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs|pages=212&ndash;232|publisher= Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34542-1}}</ref><ref name="Upchurch2000">{{cite web|last=Upchurch |first=P, ''et al.''|title=Neck Posture of Sauropod Dinosaurs|publisher=''Science'' 287, 547b (2000); DOI: 10.1126/science.287.5453.547b |year=2000|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/287/5453/547b.pdf|format = PDF | accessdate =2006-11-28 }}</ref> However, subsequent studies demonstrated that all [[tetrapod]]s appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was ''Diplodocus'', which they found would have held its neck at about a 45 degree angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.<ref>Taylor, M.P., Wedel, M.J., and Naish, D. (2009). "Head and neck posture in sauropod dinosaurs inferred from extant animals". ''Acta Palaeontologica Polonica'' 54 (2), 2009: 213<U+2013>220 [http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app54-213.html abstract]</ref>

As with the related genus ''Barosaurus'', the very long neck of ''Diplodocus'' is the source of much controversy among scientists. A 1992 [[Columbia University]] study of Diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6&nbsp;ton heart <U+2014> a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'.<ref name="UDB"/>

While the long neck has traditionally been interpreted as a feeding adaptation, it was also suggested<ref>Senter, P. "Necks for Sex: Sexual Selection as an Explanation for Sauropod Neck Elongation". Journal of Zoology, 2006</ref> that the oversized neck of ''Diplodocus'' and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display, with any other feeding benefits coming second. However, a recent study refuted this idea in detail.<ref name=tayloretal2011>Taylor, M.P., Hone, D.W.E., Wedel, M.J. and Naish, D. (2011).

Chapter 4: The evolution of sauropod feeding mechanism. IN: ''Evolution of Herbivory in Terrestrial Vertebrates'' ISBN 0-521-59449-9</ref>  The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, ''Diplodocus'' wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both the upper and lower teeth.<ref name="Upchurch"/> What this means is ''Diplodocus'' and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods.

Gaia '''10''', 195<U+2013>204</ref> as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth<U+2013>food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer.  With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action.<ref name="Upchurch"/> Also the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.<ref name="Upchurch"/>

With a laterally and dorsoventrally flexible neck, and the possibility of using its tail and rearing up on its hind limbs (tripodal ability), ''Diplodocus'' would have had the ability to browse at many levels (low, medium, and high), up to approximately 10&nbsp;metres (33&nbsp;ft) from the ground.<ref>Barrett, P.M. & Upchurch, P. (2005). Sauropodomorph Diversity through Time, Paleoecological and Macroevolutionary Implications. IN: "The Sauropods: Evolution and Paleobiology" (Eds. Curry, K. C.)</ref> The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to graze below the level of the body, leading some scientists to speculate on whether ''Diplodocus'' grazed on submerged water plants, from riverbanks. This concept of the feeding posture is supported by the relative lengths of front and hind limbs. Furthermore, its peglike teeth may have been used for eating soft water plants.<ref name="stevens05"/>

In 2010, Whitlock ''et al.'' described a juvenile skull of ''Diplodocus'' (CM&nbsp;11255) that differs greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout is not blunt, and the teeth are not confined to the front of the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently.  Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.<ref name="JVP302">{{cite journal|last=Whitlock|first=John A.|coauthors=Wilson, Jeffrey A. & Lamanna, Matthew C.|date=March 2010|title=Description of a Nearly Complete Juvenile Skull of ''Diplodocus'' (Sauropoda: Diplodocoidea) from the Late Jurassic of North America|journal=[[Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology]]|location=2|volume=30|issue=2|pages=442<U+2013>457|doi=10.1080/02724631003617647}}</ref>

The head of ''Diplodocus'' has been widely depicted with the nostrils on top due to the position of the nasal openings at the apex of the skull. There has been speculation over whether such a configuration meant that ''Diplodocus'' may have had a trunk.<ref>Bakker, Robert T. (1986) The Dinosaur Heresies: New Theories Unlocking the Mystery of the Dinosaurs and their Extinction. New York: Morrow.</ref> A recent study<ref>Knoll, F., Galton, P.M., L<U+00F3>pez-Anto<U+00F1>anzas, R. (2006). "Paleoneurological evidence against a proboscis in the sauropod dinosaur ''Diplodocus''." ''Geobios'', '''39''': 215<U+2013>221</ref> surmised there was no paleoneuroanatomical evidence for a trunk. It noted that the [[facial nerve]] in an animal with a trunk, such as an elephant, is large as it innervates the trunk. The evidence suggests that the facial nerve is very small in ''Diplodocus''. Studies by Lawrence Witmer (2001) indicated that, while the nasal openings were high on the head, the actual, fleshy nostrils were situated much lower down on the snout.<ref>Lawrence M. Witmer et al., "Nostril Position in Dinosaurs and other Vertebrates and its Significance for Nasal Function." Science '''293''', 850 (2001)</ref>

Recent discoveries have suggested that ''Diplodocus'' and other diplodocids may have had narrow, pointed [[keratin]]ous spines lining their back, much like those on an [[iguana]].<ref>Czerkas, S. A. (1993). "Discovery of dermal spines reveals a new look for sauropod dinosaurs." Geology '''20''', 1068<U+2013>1070</ref><ref>Czerkas, S. A. (1994). "The history and interpretation of sauropod skin impressions." In ''Aspects of Sauropod Paleobiology'' (M. G. Lockley, V. F. dos Santos, C. A. Meyer, and A. P. Hunt, Eds.), ''Gaia'' '''No. 10'''. (Lisbon, Portugal).</ref> This radically different look has been incorporated into recent reconstructions, notably ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''. It is unknown exactly how many diplodocids had this trait, and whether it was present in other sauropods.

===Reproduction and growth===
While there is no evidence for ''Diplodocus'' nesting habits, other [[sauropod]]s such as the [[titanosaur]]ian ''[[Saltasaurus]]'' have been associated with nesting sites.<ref>Walking on Eggs: The Astonishing Discovery of Thousands of Dinosaur Eggs in the Badlands of Patagonia, by Luis Chiappe and Lowell Dingus. 19 June 2001, Scribner</ref><ref>Grellet-Tinner, Chiappe, & Coria, "Eggs of titanosaurid sauropods from the Upper Cretaceous of Auca Mahuevo (Argentina)", Can. J. Earth Sci. 41(8): 949<U+2013>960 (2004)</ref>  The titanosaurian nesting sites indicate that may have laid their eggs communally over a large area in many shallow pits, each covered with vegetation. It is possible that ''Diplodocus'' may have done the same. The documentary ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' portrayed a mother ''Diplodocus'' using an [[ovipositor]] to lay eggs, but it was pure speculation on the part of the documentary.

Following a number of [[bone]] [[histology]] studies, ''Diplodocus'', along with other sauropods, grew at a very fast rate, reaching [[sexual maturity]] at just over a decade, though continuing to grow throughout their lives.<ref>Sander, P. M. (2000). "Long bone histology of the Tendaguru sauropods:  Implications for growth and biology". Paleobiology '''26''', 466<U+2013>488</ref><ref>Sander, P. M., N. Klein, E. Buffetaut, G. Cuny, V. Suteethorn, and J.  Le Loeuff (2004).  "Adaptive radiation in sauropod dinosaurs: Bone  histology indicates rapid evolution of giant body size through  acceleration". Organisms, Diversity & Evolution '''4''', 165<U+2013>173</ref><ref>Sander, P. M., and N. Klein (2005). "Developmental plasticity in the  life history of a prosauropod dinosaur". Science '''310''' 1800<U+2013>1802</ref> Previous thinking held that sauropods would keep growing slowly throughout their lifetime, taking decades to reach maturity.

===Daily activity patterns===
Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral ring]]s of ''Diplodocus'' and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been [[cathemeral]], active throughout the day at short intervals.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmitz, L.; Motani, R. |year=2011 |title=Nocturnality in Dinosaurs Inferred from Scleral Ring and Orbit Morphology |journal=Science |volume=332 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1126/science.1200043 |pmid=21493820}}</ref>

==Classification==
''Diplodocus'' is both the [[type genus]] of, and gives its name to '''Diplodocidae''', the family to which it belongs.<ref name="marsh84">Marsh, O.C. 1884. Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs. Part VII. On the Diplodocidae, a new family of the Sauropoda. ''American Journal of Science'' 3: 160<U+2013>168.</ref> Members of this family, while still massive, are of a markedly more slender build when compared with other sauropods, such as the [[titanosaur]]s and [[brachiosaur]]s. All are characterised by long necks and tails and a horizontal posture, with forelimbs shorter than hindlimbs. Diplodocids flourished in the Late Jurassic of North America and possibly Africa.<ref name="Rogers05"/>

A subfamily, '''Diplodocinae''', was erected to include ''Diplodocus'' and its closest relatives, including ''[[Barosaurus]]''. More distantly related is the contemporaneous ''Apatosaurus'', which is still considered a diplodocid although not a diplodocine, as it is a member of the subfamily Apatosaurinae.<ref name="taylornaish05">Taylor, M.P. & Naish, D. 2005.

''Diplodocus'' has been a famous and much-depicted dinosaur as it has been on display in more places than any other [[sauropod]] dinosaur.<ref name="ageofdinosaursdiplodocus">"Diplodocus." In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Publications International, LTD. p. 58<U+2013>59. ISBN 0-7853-0443-6.</ref> Much of this has probably been due to its wealth of skeletal remains and former status as the longest dinosaur. However, the donation of many mounted skeletal casts by industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] to potentates around the world at the beginning of the twentieth century<ref name=rea2001>Rea, Tom (2001). ''Bone Wars. The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie's Dinosaur''. Pittsburgh University Press. See particularly pages 1-11 and 198-216.</ref> did much to familiarize it to people worldwide. Casts of ''Diplodocus'' skeletons are still displayed in many museums worldwide, including an unusual ''D. hayi'' in the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], and ''D. carnegii'' in a number of institutions.

This includes donations by Carnegie or his trust to<ref>Rea (2001)</ref>:

This project, along with its association with 'big science', [[philanthropism]] and capitalism, drew much public attention in Europe. The German satirical weekly ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'' devoted a poem to the dinosaur:
<blockquote>[...]  Auch ein viel <U+00E4>lterer Herr noch mu<U+00DF> <br/>

(1988). ''An Odyssey in Time: the Dinosaurs of North America''. NorthWord Press, Minocqua, WI. p. 76.</ref>

A further ''D. carnegii'' is on display at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago. Additionally, ''D. longus'' is displayed the [[Senckenberg Museum]] in [[Frankfurt]] (a skeleton made up of several specimens, donated in 1907 by the [[American museum of natural history|American Museum of Natural History]]), Germany.<ref>Sachs, Sven (2001).

"An American Dinosaur for Germany." ''The World Today'', August 1907: 846-849.</ref>	A mounted and more complete skeleton of ''D. longus'' is at the Smithsonian [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, D.C., while a mounted skeleton of ''D. hallorum'' (formerly ''Seismosaurus''), which may be the same as ''D. longus'', can be found at the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]].

''Diplodocus'' has been a frequent subject in dinosaur films, both factual and fictional. It was featured in the second episode of the award-winning BBC television series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''. The episode "Time of the Titans" follows the life of a simulated ''Diplodocus'' 152 million years ago. In literature, [[James A. Michener]]'s book ''[[Centennial (novel)|Centennial]]'' has a chapter devoted to ''Diplodocus'', narrating the life and death of one individual.<ref>See Rea (2001)</ref>
