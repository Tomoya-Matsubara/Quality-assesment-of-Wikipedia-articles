'''''Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall''''' is the sixth album (and first [[live album]]) by the [[Canadian-American]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Rufus Wainwright]], released through [[Geffen Records]] in December 2007. The album consists of live recordings from his sold-out June 14<U+2013>15, 2006 tribute concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] to the legendary American actress and singer [[Judy Garland]].<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0vfixzthldse|title=Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall|publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Backed by a 36-piece [[orchestra]] [[Conducting|conducted]] by Stephen Oremus, Wainwright recreated Garland's April 23, 1961 concert, often considered "the greatest night in show business history".<ref name=Variety>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117944197.html?categoryid=1228&cs=1|title=Rufus over the rainbow|first=Gordon|last=Cox|date=2006-05-28|publisher=[[Reed Elsevier]]|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Garland's 1961 [[double album]], ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'', a comeback performance with more than 25 American pop and jazz [[Standard (music)|standards]], was highly successful, initially spending 95 weeks on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and garnering five [[Grammy Award]]s (including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Cover]], [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Solo Vocal Performance <U+2013> Female]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineering Contribution <U+2013> Popular Recording]]).<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:j9v1z82ajyv8|title=Judy at Carnegie Hall|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=Judy%20at%20Carnegie%20Hall&winner=&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=Judy+at+Carnegie+Hall&winner=&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=Grammy Award Winners - Judy at Carnegie Hall|publisher=[[Grammy Award]]s}}</ref>

''Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall'' managed to chart in two nations, peaking at #88 in the [[Netherlands]] and #171 on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=NetherlandsChart>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-13|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?cat=a&cat2=s&search=Rufus+Wainwright|title=Rufus Wainwright Dutch Charting|publisher=DutchCharts.nl}}</ref><ref name=Billboard200>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-13|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=154272&model.vnuAlbumId=915819|title=Rufus Wainwright American Charting|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]}}</ref>

Guests on the album include Wainwright's sister [[Martha Wainwright]] ("[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]"), his mother [[Kate McGarrigle]] (piano, "[[Over the Rainbow]]"), along with one of Garland's daughters, [[Lorna Luft]] ("[[After You've Gone (song)|After You've Gone]]"). Related to the album, the February 25, 2007 tribute concert filmed at the [[London Palladium]] was released on DVD as ''[[Rufus! Rufus! Rufus! Does Judy! Judy! Judy!: Live from the London Palladium]]'' on December 4, 2007.

==Conception and development==
According to [[Pitchfork Media]], Wainwright "started listening to the Carnegie Hall album in the weeks and months after [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], craving some cheap showbiz cheer, but wound up discovering something deeper".<ref name=PitchforkMedia>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-13|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/47791-rufus-does-judy-live-at-carnegie-hall|title=Rufus Wainwright: Rufus Does Judy Live at Carnegie Hall|first=Stephen|last=Trouss<U+00E9>|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2008-01-07}}</ref> The subsequent [[War on Terrorism]] and [[invasion of Iraq]] caused Wainwright to become "traumatized and disillusioned with anything American".<ref name=Uncut>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/rufus_wainwright/reviews/10946|title=Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall Review|first=John|last=Robinson|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|publisher=IPC Media|date=February 2008}}</ref> Claiming he was reminded of how great "the US used to be",<ref name=Uncut/> Wainwright said the following of his appreciation for the album during that turbulent time in American history:

{{Quote|Somehow that album, no matter how dark things seemed, made everything brighten. She had this capacity to lighten the world through the innocence of her sound. Her anchor to the material was obviously through her devotion to music. You never feel that she didn't believe every word of every song she ever sang."<ref name=TheNewYorkTimes/>}}

{{Quote|I find the political and socioeconomic environment we live in very oppressive and very worrying, but every time I put on that live album, I was immediately put in a better mood. I was given a sense of hope and a sense of escape, only because so much of modern-day culture and radio<U+2014>and what's prized by our society<U+2014>is so empty. And then of course I would sing along."<ref name=CountdowntoJudy1>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/i-new-york/1318/countdown-to-judy|title=Countdown to Judy - Week 1: Rufus Wainwright|date=April 20-26, 2006|work=[[Time Out]]|first=Elisabeth|last=Vincentelli}}</ref>}}

Wainwright observed while driving in his car that "it [would] be funny to redo this as a song cycle".<ref name=Uncut/> Soon afterwards, he took the idea to New York-based theatrical producer [[Jared Geller]] (who would later co-produce the tribute concert with [[David Foster]]), hoping to turn a dream into a reality.<ref name=CountdowntoJudy3>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/i-new-york/1520/countdown-to-judy|title=Countdown to Judy - Week 3: Jared Geller|work=TimeOut|first=Elisabeth|last=Vincentelli|date=May 4<U+2013>10, 2006}}</ref> Geller initially thought the idea was "insane", but he and Wainwright continued discussing options. Eventually, Geller agreed to assist with the production, and the two found space in Wainwright's schedule to book Carnegie Hall a year in advance.<ref name=CountdowntoJudy3/> Once the venue was booked, staging elements such as lighting, microphone location, and amplification were discussed. Stephen Oremus signed on as the conductor of the 36-piece orchestra, and [[Phil Ramone]] took charge of the recording.<ref name=CountdowntoJudy2>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/i-new-york/1424/countdown-to-judy|title=Countdown to Judy - Week 2: Stephen Oremus|work=Time Out|first=Elisabeth|last=Vincentelli|date=April 27<U+2013>May 3, 2006}}</ref><ref name=CountdowntoJudy6>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/i-new-york/6609/countdown-to-judy|title=Countdown to Judy - Week 6: Phil Ramone|work=Time Out|first=Elisabeth|last=Vincentelli|date=May 25<U+2013>31, 2006}}</ref> Rehearsals began in April 2006, and while it would have been easier to practice in rehearsal rooms, large theaters such as the Lynch at the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] and the [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]] were utilized because "Rufus wanted a feel for performing this material on a stage".<ref name=CountdowntoJudy3/> As a result of financial restrictions, full orchestra rehearsals took place only two days before the show and the day of each performance (practice with smaller groups of instruments began a few months before the concerts).<ref name=CountdowntoJudy2/>

==Tribute concerts==
Due to popular demand, Wainwright's tribute was performed a total of six times. After tickets for the first show (June 14, 2006 at Carnegie Hall in New York City) sold out, a second show was added at the same venue for the following night (June 15). Increased demand resulted in three concerts in Europe: February 18, 2007 at the [[London Palladium]] in [[London]], February 20 at [[L'Olympia]] in [[Paris]], and February 25 once again at the London Palladium.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13500|title=Rufus!

===Promotion, celebrity participation===
Part of the success of the tribute concerts can be attributed to the amount of press attention received and the eagerness of other artists to participate in the event. As written by Gaby Wood of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wainwright "sparkled on the cover of ''[[Time Out|Time Out New York]]''" and was "adored in the pages of ''[[The New York Times]]''" following the Carnegie Hall shows.<ref name=GabyWood>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/jun/18/popandrock.rufuswainwright|title=Somewhere over the top|first=Gaby|last=Wood|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2006-06-18}}</ref> In [[fashion design]]er [[Marc Jacobs]]' menswear boutique in [[Greenwich Village]], "virtually nothing was for sale except T-shirts advertising the show" (the bright orange shirts contained the text "RUFUS RUFUS RUFUS" and "world's greatest entertainer", mimicking promotional material used for Garland 45 years earlier).<ref name=GabyWood/> [[Film director]] [[Sam Mendes]] planned to create a [[Documentary film|documentary]] about Wainwright's re-creation and the work leading up to it, though the project fell through.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1210914,00.html|title=Wish You Were There?|first=Beth|last=Johnson|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=2006-07-07}}</ref> Dutch designers [[Viktor & Rolf]] outfitted Wainwright and his family members for the concerts.<ref name=KittyEmpire>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/feb/25/popandrock.features2|title=Rufus Wainwright, London Palladium, W1|first=Kitty|last=Empire|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=2007-02-25|work=[[The Observer]]}}</ref> To return the favor Wainwright wrote the song "Ode to Antidote", and allowed its use in the promotion of the design duo's [[perfume|cologne]], "Antidote".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://viktoretrolf.typepad.com/viktor_rolf/2006/08/ode_to_antidote.html|title=Ode to Antidote - Rufus Wainwright - Viktor & Rolf - Antidote|publisher=[[Viktor & Rolf]]|date=2006-08-14}}</ref> He also helped premiere the cologne at the after-party for his first Garland tribute, and later performed "[[Over the Rainbow]]" at the premiere of their Spring 2007 [[fashion line]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/S2007RTW-VIKROLF/|title=Viktor & Rolf Spring 2007 Ready-to-Wear Collection|first=Sarah|last=Mower|date=2006-10-02|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]]}}</ref> Wainwright wore clothing by [[Tom Ford]] at the Hollywood Bowl concert.<ref name=Advocate>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid49311.asp|title=Rufus Hearts Judy|first=Job|last=Brother|date=2007-09-25|work=[[The Advocate]]|publisher=[[LPI Media]]}}</ref> To promote the album, Wainwright's website linked to an online store where fans could purchase merchandise, including several shirt designs, concert posters, [[Event program|programs]], and other collectibles.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://rufuswainwright.com/news/default.aspx?nid=13474|title=Rufus at Carnegie Hall Official Posters and T-shirts!|publisher=rufuswainwright.com|date=2006-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-15|url=http://hifidelity-rufuswainwright.11345.com/catalog_carnegie.php|title=Rufus Wainwright Online Store|publisher=Hi Fidelity Entertainment}}</ref> Like the shirts sold by Marc Jacobs, much of the promotional material mimicked posters used for Garland's concert years before.

==Music==
===Songs===
The songs on the album are identical to those performed on Garland's 1961 album, ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'', except Wainwright's album included "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" as a bonus track in the UK and on [[iTunes]] in the US.<ref name=Bonus>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-12|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0vfyxzlkldse|title=Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall (UK Bonus Track)|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> "Hail[ing] from a golden era dotted with trolley cars, Cadillacs, and glitzy jazz clubs",<ref name=Allmusic/> the set list included more than 25 American swing tunes, jazz, and pop standards, including two [[Rodgers and Hart]] classics ("[[This Can't Be Love (song)|This Can't Be Love]]", "You're Nearer"), three from brothers [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] ("[[Who Cares?]]", "[[How Long Has This Been Going On?]]", and "[[A Foggy Day]]"), two from duo [[Howard Dietz]] and [[Arthur Schwartz]] ("Alone Together", "[[That's Entertainment! (song)|That's Entertainment!]]"), [[Harold Arlen]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]], and more. Wainwright performed the songs nearly identically to Garland, even "flubb[ing]" the lyrics purposely on "[[You Go to My Head]]" to mimic the mistake made by Garland years before.<ref name=PitchforkMedia/>

===Orchestrations===
Stephen Oremus, musical director for the tribute concerts, faced the task of resurrecting Mort Lindsay's original arrangements written for a 36-piece orchestra.<ref name=CountdowntoJudy2/> Although it is no longer common to have orchestras so large (Oremus acknowledged that even ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] only had 22 pieces), Wainwright and Oremus insisted the full 36-piece ensemble should be utilized to create "as exact a replica as [they could] muster".<ref name=CountdowntoJudy2/> Some songs had to be reconstructed since the music was not available, while other pieces had to be transcribed, as Wainwright was performing them in a different key.<ref name=CountdowntoJudy2/>

==Gay elements==
{{See also|Judy Garland as gay icon}}
[[Image:Judy Garland in Summer Stock trailer 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Garland performing "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" in ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950); Wainwright re-created this [[Camp (style)|camp]] performance on part of his ''[[Release the Stars]]'' tour]]

Garland was a [[gay icon]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Haggerty|first=George E|title=Gay Histories and Cultures|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc|page=230|isbn=0815318804|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=L9Mj7oHEwVoC&dq=%22Gay+Histories+and+Cultures%22+Geroge+Haggerty&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=cbpuZ66UXn&sig=701oVn-GqqEQaYNfwMRO1R8JR8w&ei=1gSXScmsEJGksQPq3bB1&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA230,M1|date=2000}}</ref> even before Wainwright was born. Gay identification with Garland was being discussed in the mainstream as early as 1967. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in reviewing Garland's 1967 [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] engagement, disparagingly noted that a "disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]". It goes on to say that "[t]he boys in the tight trousers"<ref name=Palace>{{cite news|title=Seance at the Palace|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1967-08-18|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840977,00.html|accessdate=2007-12-26}}</ref> would "roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats" during Garland's performances. ''Time'' then attempted to explain Garland's appeal to the homosexual, consulting psychiatrists who opined that "the attraction [to Garland] might be made considerably stronger by the fact that she has survived so many problems; homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria" and that "Judy was beaten up by life, embattled, and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her."<ref name=Palace/>

Garland always had a large base of fans in the [[gay community]], which includes Wainwright, who identifies as gay and came out to his parents at the age of 14.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wainwright Stuff|first=Randy|last=Shulman|publisher=''[[Metro Weekly]]''|date=2009-03-11|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=659}}</ref> A connection is frequently drawn between the timing of Garland's death and funeral, in June 1969, and the [[Stonewall riots]], the flashpoint of the modern [[Gay Liberation]] movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Neil|title=Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present|publisher=Vintage UK|year=1995|page=367|isbn=009957691}}</ref> Coincidental or not, the proximity of Garland's death to Stonewall has become a part of [[LGBT history]] and lore.<ref name=TheNewYorkTimes>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/fashion/sundaystyles/04RUFUS.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/G/Garland,%20Judy|title=Rufus Wainwright Plays Judy Garland|date=2006-06-04|first=Guy|last=Trebay|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Wainwright, having been called the "first post-liberation era gay pop star", was obsessed with ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) as a child and would dress in his mother's gown, "pretend[ing] to be either the [[Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch]] -- melting for hours on end -- or the [[Glinda|Good Witch]], depending on his mood".<ref name=TheNewYorkTimes/><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23017026-5006024,00.html|title=Rufus Wainwright delights in Judy Garland revival|first=James|last=Wigney|date=2008-01-07|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd]]}}</ref> Wainwright also claims his mother (Canadian [[folk music|folk musician]] [[Kate McGarrigle]]) forced him to perform "[[Over the Rainbow]]" for guests while growing up, a song he often included in his concert repertoire as an adult.<ref name=KittyEmpire/> 

Wainwright never intended to impersonate Garland or create a [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] act, but rather to inhabit the songs and expose them to a new generation.<ref name=CountdowntoJudy1/> However, there was a certain [[Camp (style)|camp]] style present, of which Wainwright stated the following: "I think that any gay person in the world would be seduced at one point by a certain kind of camp. For certain people it's kind of a saving grace."<ref name=TheNewYorkTimes/> Regarding the tribute concerts and homosexuality, Wainwright admitted:

{{Quote|I don't think it would have been possible for anyone other than a gay male to do this concert. In a weird way, a gay man has some sort of perspective on it, I believe.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5475107|title=Wainwright to Channel Judy Garland, Live|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2006-06-10}}</ref>}}

While Wainwright did not dress in drag at any of the tribute shows in New York or Europe, he did return to the stage in "Judy drag" for an encore at the Hollywood Bowl performance, "bedecked in a double-breasted [[Black tie|tuxedo jacket]] sans pants, black [[stocking]]s, [[high-heeled footwear|high heels]], [[earring]]s, [[lipstick]], and a tilted [[fedora]]".<ref name=Advocate/> He also took "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" from the set and performed the tune "[[Summer Stock]]"-style during part of his ''[[Release the Stars]]'' tour to mimic the look of Garland during her performance (pictured on right).<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-14|url=http://www.nme.com/news/glastonbury/29158|title=Rufus Wainwright duets with Martha Wainwright at Glastonbury|work=[[NME]]|date=2007-06-22}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Overall, reception of the album was positive. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' called Wainwright's tribute "a fabulous stunt in which a gay singer channeled the spirit of the ultimate gay icon", and declared the album was "as good an introduction to the great American songbook as any".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-13|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=4907|title=Rufus Wainwright : Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|publisher=Alpha Media Group Inc|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> Pitchfork Media's Stephen Trouss<U+00E9> wrote that Wainwright "elegantly outdoes [Garland] on a couple of the ballads" and also compliments guest performer Martha Wainwright, "who turns in a stunning, showstopping 'Stormy Weather' in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show".<ref name=PitchforkMedia/> In his review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] stated it was "a relief to hear him essay the show tunes and [[Tin Pan Alley]] chestnuts of this tribute album". Furthermore, he wrote that the songs "expand [Wainwright's] melodic compass", allowing him to "bring something new to them too <U+2014> namely, sexuality in the sensuality as opposed to gender-preference sense".<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-13|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/17395637/review/17436794/rufus_does_judy_at_carnegie_hall|title=Rufus Does Judy At Carnegie Hall|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|first=Robert|last=Christgau|date=2007-12-13}}</ref> Dave Hughes of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' had positive comments about the album: "That Wainwright has the temerity to cover such a bona fide classic<U+2014>and the chops to pull it off without breaking a limb or his brain<U+2014>speaks both to his ambition and to his prodigious abilities."<ref name=SlantMagazine>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-13|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=1245|title=Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2007-12-04|first=Dave|last=Hughes}}</ref>

The album did receive some criticism. After noting Garland's lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation, Christgau claimed Wainwright's habit of "slid[ing] past notes and draw[ing] out the final syllables of lines are signatures indistinguishable from tics".<ref name=RollingStone/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's "delicate upper range is nicely attuned to some of the ballads, but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-13|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20162414,00.html|title=Music Review - Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Time Inc|date=2007-11-23|first=Chris|last=Willman}}</ref> Mark Edwards of ''[[The Times]]'' called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his "trademark delivery" is "lazy and somewhat slurred".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-02-13|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article3204835.ece|title=Rufus Wainwright: Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall|first=Mark|last=Edwards|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|date=2008-01-20}}</ref> Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's "problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'", but admits it would be unfair to hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either. Hughes appropriately notes, "Ain't nobody perfect".<ref name=SlantMagazine/>
