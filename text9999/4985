'''Maurice K. Goddard''' (1912-1995) was the driving force behind the creation of 45 [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state parks]] during his 24 years as a cabinet officer for six [[governor]]s of the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]]. 

Maurice K. Goddard was born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. His family moved around during his childhood so that he lived in [[Kansas]] and [[Toronto, Canada|Toronto]] before finally settling in [[Portland, Maine]]. Goddard received a B.S. in [[Forestry]] from the [[University of Maine]] in 1935. He held a teaching position in forestry at [[Penn State Mont Alto|The Mont Alto School of Forestry]] in [[Franklin County, Pennsylvania]] from 1935-1937. He left in 1938 to receive his Masters in Forestry from the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. He served under the direct command of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], reaching the rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel]]. He was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] and the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. 

Following his discharge from the Army, Goddard returned to his career in forestry. He accepted a position as the director of forestry at The Mont Alto School of Forestry. From there he served the same position at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in [[University Park, Pennsylvania]]. At this time Goddard began to formulate plans for the future of the state parks in Pennsylvania. [[George M. Leader]] was elected governor of Pennsylvania in 1954 and sought Goddard's advice about who should lead the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters. After receiveing Goddard's advice, Governor Leader instead appointed Goddard as the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, a forerunner to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].

As Secretary, Goddard set out to improve the forest department by eliminating political appointees and increasing the number of college-educated employees. With his new group of employees, Goddard and the Department of Forests and Waters set a goal of establishing a [[state park]] within 25&nbsp;miles (40&nbsp;km) of every resident of Pennsylvania. He fell short of this goal, but under his leadership the number of state parks in Pennsylvania grew by 45, and there was an increase in size of over 130,000&nbsp;acres (526&nbsp;km<U+00B2>).

Goddard went on to oversee the creation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, a combination of several other state departments. Goddard retired in 1979 and remained active in the environmental movement, serving on the boards of the [[Chesapeake Bay Foundation]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], Pennsylvania Environmental Council, and Pennsylvania Forestry Association. He died on [[September 14]], [[1995]] at age 83, from injuries received in a fire at his home in [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania]].
