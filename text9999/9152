The '''919th Air Refueling Squadron''' is an inactive [[United States Air Force]] unit. It was last assigned to the [[306th Bombardment Wing]], stationed at [[McCoy AFB]], [[Florida]]. It was inactivated on 30 June 1971.

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated as the '''619th Bombardment Squadron''' in 1943.  It was one of the four squadrons of the [[477th Bombardment Group]], the first (and only) bombardment group in the [[united States Army Air Forces]] to included black pilots.  Members of the squadron participated in the [[Freeman Field Mutiny]], protesting [[racial segregation]] in the military.  The squadron was inactivated in 1945 when the 477th became a composite group that included one [[bomber|bombardment]] and one [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron.

The '''919th Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated as a [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) tanker squadron in 1960 and moved to [[Turner Air Force Base]], Georgia as part of SAC's program to disperse its [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] as a defense against a first strike by the [[Soviet Union]].  The squadron served in this capacity for eleven years during which it deployed aircraft and [[aircrew]]s to Southeast Asia during the [[Viet Nam War]].

The two squadrons were consolidated into a single unit in 1985, but the consolidated squadron has never been active.
==History==
===World War II===
[[File:619th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|thumb|left|150px|619th Bombardment Squadron Emblem]]
The '''619th Bombardment Squadron''' was activated in June 1943 at [[MacDill Field]], Florida.<ref name=Maurer619BS>{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_sq_of_the_af_wwii.pdf |edition= reprint|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402|page=688}}</ref>  as one of the four original [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] of the [[477th Bombardment Group]]<ref name=Maurer477BG>{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/af_combat_units_wwii.pdf |edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|pages=349-350}}</ref>, but was inactivated in August.

The 477th group was reactivated in January 1944 at [[Selfridge Field]], Michigan as the "first colored bombardment group in the [[Army Air Forces]]" with personnel drawn from Selfridge and from [[Tuskegee Army Air Field]], Alabama.<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/094/561.xml Abstract, History 477 Bombardment Group Jan-Jul 1944] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref>  The group moved to [[Godman Field]], Kentucky, where the 619th was activated in April.<ref name=Maurer619BS/>  The unit encountered problems attributed to the lack of experienced personnel, which required even basic training in military occupational specialties to be conducted within the unit, rather than at technical training schools.<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/094/564.xml Abstract, History 477 Bombardment Group Oct 1944-Jan 1945] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref>

Although designated a "colored" squadron, some officers, including the squadron leadership were white.  The initial commander of the 477th group enforced racial segregation on the posts where the squadron was stationed.  The squadron's members were involved in the civil rights action referred to as the [[Freeman Field Mutiny]]; the "mutiny" came about when African-American aviators became outraged enough by [[racial segregation]] in the military that they resorted to mass insistence that military regulations prohibiting discrimination be enforced. The Freeman Field Mutiny was a crucial event in the African-American struggle for equal civil rights.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moye|first=J.

The 619th was inactivated in June 1945 when the 477th became a composite group formed of the [[99th Fighter Squadron]], [[617th Bombardment Squadron]] and [[618th Bombardment Squadron]]<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/094/566.xml Abstract, History 477 Bombardment Group Apr-Jul 1945] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref> and Colonel [[Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.]], a black officer, assumed command of the group.<ref name=Maurer477BG/>

===Cold War===
The '''919th Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated on 15 April 1960 by [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) at [[Carswell AFB]], Texas<ref name=Mueller>{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Robert|title=Air Force Bases, Vol. I, Active Air Force Bases Within the United States of America on 17 September 1982|url= http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100921-026.pdf |year=1989|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-53-6|page=69}}</ref> and assigned to the [[7th Bombardment Wing]]<ref name=Ravenstein7BW>{{cite book|last=Ravenstein|first=Charles A.|title=Air Force Combat Wings, Lineage & Honors Histories 1947-1977|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_wings.pdf |year=1984|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-12-9|pages=28}}</ref> as one of two [[aerial refueling|tanker]] squadrons activated that day for assignment to dispersed [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] wings.   The squadron was equipped with [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.   The squadron moved to [[Turner AFB]], Georgia in June and was assigned to the [[4138th Strategic Wing]], where half of the squadrons's aircraft were maintained on fifteen minute [[alert state|alert]], fully fueled and ready for combat.<ref name=4138Jul1960>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/461/048.xml Abstract, History 4138 Strategic Wing July 1960] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref>   The 919th maintained its alert commitment until it was inactivated, except for periods when the squadron was deployed. 

The squadron deployed aircraft and [[aircrew]] to the Western Pacific, 1966-1967 to support SAC operations along with tactical aircraft flying combat missions over Indochina during the [[Vietnam War]] (Operation Young Tiger).<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/459/028.xml Abstract, (Unclassified) History 484 Bombardment Wing Jul-Sep 1965 (Confidential)] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref> During September 1966, the squadron was non-operational when all its crews and aircraft were deployed to support [[Operation Arc Light]].<ref>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/459/037.xml Abstract, History 484 Bombardment Wing Oct-Dec 1966] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref>   When Turner was transferred to the [[United States Navy]] in 1967<ref name=484BW1967>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/459/038.xml Abstract, History 484 Bombardment Wing Jan-Mar 1967] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref> the squadron moved to [[McCoy Air Force Base]], Florida.    In 1969 the squadron won the '''Saunders Trophy''' as the best air refueling squadron duing SAC's annual Bombing and Navigation Competition.<ref name=306BW1969>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/454/825.xml Abstract, History 306 Bombardment Wing Jul 1969-Mar 1970] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref>   The following year the squadron converted from KC-135A aircraft to KC-135Qs.<ref name=306BW1970>[http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/467/370.xml Abstract, History 306 Bombardment Wing Jan-Mar 1970] (retrieved October 5, 2013)</ref>  The squadron remained at McCoy until it was inactivated in 1971 and its equipment and personnel transferred to the [[306th Air Refueling Squadron]].   

The '''919th Air Refueling Squadron''' was consolidated with the '''619th Bombardment Squadron''' in 1985 but the consolidated squadron has not been active.<ref name=DAFMPM662q>Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 662q, 19 September 85, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Tactical Squadrons</ref>
