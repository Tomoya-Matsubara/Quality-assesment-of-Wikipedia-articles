'''Dagfinn Enerly''' (born [[December 9]], [[1972]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]) is a Norwegian [[football (soccer)|football]] player. He has played for Norwegian [[tippeligaen|Premier League]] clubs [[Skeid]], [[Moss F.K.|Moss]], [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] and [[Fredrikstad FK|Fredrikstad]]. He has two appearances for the [[Norwegian national football team|Norwegian national team]], and is a former national team regular in [[football tennis]]. He is still registered as a Fredrikstad player, but because of a serious neck injury suffered on the final day of the [[2005 in Norwegian football|2005]] season, it's highly unlikely that he ever plays football at a high level again.

Enerly grew up in [[Ammerud]] on Oslo's east side, and started his career for local clubs Grorud and later Grei. He then went to the Oslo-club Skeid and with them got his debut in the Norwegian Premier League in 1996. Enerly made his mark with high speed, good technique and strong long-kicks, and with his sensitive right foot he normally plays on the right-wing. When Skeid relegated in 1997, he went to Moss, where he played for three seasons before being signed by reigning champions Rosenborg. Enerly spent three and a half seasons in Rosenborg, and helped win the League three times. After getting too little playing time on Rosenborg, he joined Fredrikstad halfway into the 2004-season. Here his experience quickly made him an important player and he became team captain.

In the last game of the 2005-season, on [[October 29]], Fredrikstad had to beat the series leaders [[I.K. Start|Start]], away in Kristiansand to avoid [[relegation]]. Fredrikstad won the match 3-1, causing Start to lose the gold to [[V<U+00E5>lerenga I.F. Fotball|V<U+00E5>lerenga]] and most importantly; Fredrikstad saved their place in the league.

Sadly only five minutes into the game, Enerly crashed with a team-mate, fell to the ground with his team-mate over him and laid there without moving a muscle. Enerly could be seen breathing as medical personnel rushed to his aid and got him on a stretcher. Shortly afterwards, the speaker at the stadium informed the crowd that he was conscious and in a stable condition. Later that evening it was learned that Enerly, who was sent to Oslo's [[Ullev<U+00E5>l university hospital|Ullev<U+00E5>l hospital]] for surgery, had broken his neck and was paralyzed. 

The news of his injuries shocked all of Norway and overshadowed all the football-related celebrations around the country. In the days that followed he received well-wishings from every walk of life in Norway, including from the stars of [[Real Madrid]] visiting Norway for a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]-match.[http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/sport/story/0,2789,722579,00.html] A massive [[short message service|SMS]]-campaign was created getting people to light a candle in their window at 8 in the evening (Enerly had shirt #8), and thousands of Norwegian [[MSN Messenger]]-users placed a heart in front of their user name as a sign they were thinking of him.

The future outcome of his injuries are still unclear. It was reported in January 2006 that Enerly has regained some movement in his arms, but that his legs are still paralyzed. [http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/01/19/455223.html]

As of December 2006 it is reported that he has regained movement and strength in his left arm, and some in his right arm (can lift up to 4 kgs).

As Fredrikstad F.K. were celebrating their [[Norwegian football cup|cup]]-championship in 2006 at [[Ullevaal Stadion]], Enerly was brought onto the pitch to celebrate with the players, as a gesture for his involvement in the club even after his injury.

Enerly is married and has two twin daughters (born [[October 30]], 2003).
