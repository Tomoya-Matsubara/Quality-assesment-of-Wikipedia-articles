'''Nishiura''' is a small fishing community in the city of [[Gamagori]], [[Japan]].   The town itself is non-descript apart from the large collection of [[onsen]], also known as [[hot springs]], found on its beach front. The area is famous for the medicinal properties of its water and a number of hotels have sprung up to accommodate the tourists visiting these spas.
