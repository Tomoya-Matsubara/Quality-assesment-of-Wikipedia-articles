'''Michael Burns''' (born 6 February 1969) is an English reserve list [[Umpire (cricket)|cricket umpire]] and former [[first-class cricket]]er who played [[county cricket]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] and [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in a [[first-class cricket|first-class]] career which spanned from 1992 until 2005. He also played [[Minor Counties cricket|minor counties cricket]] for [[Cumberland County Cricket Club|Cumberland]] and [[Cornwall County Cricket Club|Cornwall]]. An adaptable cricketer, he appeared for Cumberland and Warwickshire as a [[wicket-keeper]], but when he moved to Somerset he developed into an aggressive [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] who [[Bowling (cricket)|bowled]] at [[Fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|medium-pace]] when needed.

Burns started his cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He struggled to break into the first team with his new county, and spent most of his time with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of [[Keith Piper (cricketer)|Keith Piper]], and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.

For Somerset, Burns passed 1,000 first-class [[Run (cricket)|runs]] in a season twice, and was part of the team which won the [[2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy]]. He provided Somerset with a batting [[all-rounder]], particularly in [[Limited overs cricket|one-day cricket]] in which he [[Batting average#Cricket|averaged]] 27 with the bat and 30 [[Bowling average|with the ball]] for the county. He took over as [[List of Somerset cricket captains|Somerset captain]] in 2003, primarily due to the lack of other suitable candidates. He continued in the role in the following year, though he was criticised throughout due to poor results, which at one stage resulted in a number of Somerset's players being threatened with [[Termination of employment|being sacked]]. He was replaced as captain in 2005 by [[Graeme Smith]], and retired from first-class cricket at the end of that year. He subsequently trained as an [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire]], and was promoted to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]]'s (ECB) reserve list in 2012.

===Limited opportunities at Warwickshire===
[[File:Fenners1.jpg|thumb|right|Burns made his first-class debut at [[Fenner's]] cricket ground in [[Cambridge]].]]
After initially playing club cricket for Vickerstown, Burns moved to [[Netherfield Cricket Club]], where he played alongside [[Dermot Reeve]], the club's professional player. Reeve was impressed by an innings in which Burns scored a [[Century (cricket)|half-century]], and arranged for Warwickshire to offer him a trial.<ref name="hero"/> Burns scored 83 runs in his trial match,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/53/53265.html |title=Warwickshire Under-25s v Northamptonshire Under-25s: Warwick Pool Competition 1990 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref> and signed a contract shortly thereafter.<ref name="hero"/> At the end of that 1990 season, Burns played a second-team match for Warwickshire; the following season he made his debut in professional cricket for the county, playing a [[Benson & Hedges Cup]] match against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]].

===Move to Somerset===
Towards the end of the 1996 season, Warwickshire's captain [[Dermot Reeve]] was forced to retire with a chronic hip injury.<ref name="wisden97"/> He moved to [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in 1997, where he took on the role of team [[Coach (sport)|coach]]; Burns followed him soon after.<ref name="ciprof"/> Somerset did not have a vacancy for a wicket-keeper; in 1997, ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' described [[Robert Turner (cricketer)|Robert Turner]] as top-class.

His batting continued to flourish at Somerset in first-class cricket; between 1999 and 2004, he consistently averaged over 35. His highest batting average came in 2000, when he scored 775 runs at 40.78.

In 2001, Burns reached his highest first-class score, and only double-century, scoring 221 against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] at the [[Recreation Ground (Bath)|Recreation Ground]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

===Somerset captaincy===
[[File:Jamie Cox crop.jpg|thumb|right|Burns took over the Somerset captaincy from Australian [[Jamie Cox]].]]
Cox resigned the club captaincy at the end of the 2002 season, and Burns was named as his replacement; ''Wisden'' described him as a "dedicated, down-to-earth cricketer who hopes to lead by example from high in the order."<ref name="wisden2003"/> In a preview of the 2003 season for the [[BBC]], [[Simon Mann]] wrote that Somerset had the talent to improve and he predicted that an immediate promotion back to the first division of the County Championship was "a strong possibility."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/somerset/2913513.stm |title=Somerset have talent to rise again |last=Mann |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Mann |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=8 April 2003 |accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> The season began in positive fashion for Burns; in a first-class match against [[Loughborough MCC University|Loughborough University]] he scored 83 runs in the first innings and was 118 not out in the second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/76/76856.html |title=Somerset v Loughborough University Centre of Cricketing Excellence: University Centres of Cricketing Excellence 2003 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> He continued to score runs regularly, if not spectacularly, throughout the season, and passed 1,000 first-class runs for the second consecutive year.

===Later career===
The signing of Smith, along with the youth policy adopted by Somerset's new first-team coach, [[Mark Garaway]], meant that Burns had limited opportunities in 2005; he played nine first-class<ref name="fcbbs"/> and eight List A matches during the season,<ref name="labbs"/> and did not appear for the first team after July. He scored an early-season century, hitting eleven boundaries on his way to 107 runs against Warwickshire in the totesport League,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/82/82035.html |title=Warwickshire v Somerset: totesport League 2005 (Division 2) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> but only scored 63 runs across his remaining seven one-day matches.<ref name="labbs"/> As a result of his lack of first-team action, he opted to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/220144.html |title=Farewell and thanks for the memories |author=ESPNcricinfo staff |date=26 September 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> In all, he scored 7,648 first-class runs at an average of 32.68, and 4,802 List A runs at 25.81.
