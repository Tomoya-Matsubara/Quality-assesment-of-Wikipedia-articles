==Accident==
The Monster Truck Racing Association has stated that spectators were situated at event level and in close proximity to the performance area, separated by only bike rack barricades. It also stated that multiple layers of safety precaution, such as an on-board Remote Ignition Interrupter (RII) to allow event staff to instantly disable the vehicle, would have undoubtedly prevented the accident.<ref>[http://mtra.us/2014/09/29/mtra-official-statement-haaksbergen-incident/ MTRA Official Statement: Haaksbergen Incident].
