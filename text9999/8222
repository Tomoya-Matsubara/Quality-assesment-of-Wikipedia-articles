'''''Hadropithecus''''' is a medium-sized, [[extinct]] genus of [[lemur]], or [[strepsirrhine]] [[primate]], from [[Madagascar]] that includes a single species, '''''Hadropithecus stenognathus'''''.  Both it and ''[[Archaeolemur]]'' are collectively known as "[[monkey lemur]]s" or "baboon lemurs" due to [[body plan]]s and [[dentition]] that suggest a [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] lifestyle and a diet similar to that of modern [[baboon]]s.  ''Hadropithecus'' had extended molars and a short, powerful jaw, suggesting that it was both a [[Grazing|grazer]] and a [[Seed predation|seed predator]].

The monkey lemurs are considered to be most closely related to the living [[indri]]ds and the recently extinct [[sloth lemur]]s, although recent finds have caused some dispute.  ''Hadropithecus'' lived in open habitat in the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar.  It is known only from [[subfossil]] or recent remains and is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur.  It died out around 444<U+2013>772 [[Common Era|CE]], shortly after the arrival of humans on the island.

==Etymology==
The common names that ''Hadropithecus'' shares with ''Archaeolemur'', "[[monkey lemur]]s" and "baboon lemurs", come from their dental and locomotor adaptations, which resemble that of modern [[Baboon|African baboon]]s.<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd">{{cite book | last = Mittermeier | first = R.A. | last2 = Konstant | first2 = W.R. | last3 = Hawkins | first3 = F. | last4 = Louis | first4 = E.E. | last5 = Langrand | first5 | O. | last6 = Ratsimbazafy | first6 = J. | last7 = Rasoloarison | first7 = R. | last8 = Ganzhorn | first8 = J.U. | last9 = Rajaobelina | first9 = S. | last10 = Tattersall | first10 = I. | last11 = Meyers | first11 = D.M. | authorlink1 = Russell Mittermeier | authorlink10 = Ian Tattersall | others = Illustrated by S.D.

The species name derives from the Greek root ''steno-'', meaning "narrow", and ''gnathos'', meaning "jaw" or "mouth".<ref name="1904Palmer">{{cite book | last1 = Palmer | first1 = T. | title = Index generum mammalium: a list of the genera and families of mammals | publisher = U.

''Hadropithecus'' is an [[extinct]] genus of [[lemur]], or [[strepsirrhine]] [[primate]], that includes a single species, ''Hadropithecus stenognathus''.  According to [[Linnaean taxonomy]], it belongs to the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Archaeolemuridae]], which in turn belongs to the infraorder [[Lemuriformes]], which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.<ref name="Nowak" />

Originally thought to have been a sister group to the living [[indri]]ds and the recently extinct [[sloth lemur]]s (family Palaeopropithecidae) because of similarities in their skull and teeth,<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd">{{cite book | last1 = Mittermeier | first1 = R.

The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indrids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indrids.  The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indrids, but very specialized skulls.  The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of ''[[Babakotia]]'' and ''[[Mesopropithecus]]'', two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indrid-like skulls and teeth.<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />  More recently, there had been some debate over whether or not the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the [[Lemuridae|lemurid]]s based [[postcrania]]l traits and other features shown in [[subfossil]] remains found in the first half of the 2000s .<ref name="2006Godfrey">{{cite journal | last1 = Godfrey | first1 = LR | last2 = Jungers | first2 = WL | last3 = Burney | first3 = DA | last4 = Vasey | first4 = N | last5 = Ramilisonina | last6 = Wheeler | first6 = W | last7 = Lemelin | first7 = P | last8 = Shapiro | first8 = LJ | last9 = Schwartz | first9 = GT | last10 = King | first10 = SJ | last11 = Ramarolahy | first11 = MF | last12 = Raharivony | first12 = LL | last13 = Randria | first13 = GF | title = New discoveries of skeletal elements of ''Hadropithecus stenognathus'' from Andrahomana Cave, southeastern Madagascar | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | year = 2006 | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 395<U+2013>410 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.04.012}}</ref>  However, [[DNA sequencing]] has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indrids and sloth lemurs.<ref name="2008Orlando" />

==Anatomy and physiology==
''Hadropithecus stenognathus'' has been estimated to have weighed between {{convert|27|and|35|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and to be roughly the same size as ''Archaeolemur'', although more gracile.<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" />  Newer subfossil finds, however, suggest that ''Hadropithecus'' may have been more robust, and more like a [[gorilla]] than a baboon.<ref name="Lemurs3" />  Both lemurs were [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] (walked on four legs).<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" />  There is no evidence of [[cursorial]]ity (adaptations specifically for running) in either species.<ref name="Lemurs3">{{cite book | editor1-last = Gould | editor1-first = L | editor2-last = Sauther | editor2-first = ML | last1 = Godfrey | first1 = LR | last2 = Jungers | first2 = WL | last3 = Schwartz | first3 = GT | chapter = Chapter 3: Ecology and Extinction of Madagascar's Subfossil Lemurs | title = Lemurs: Ecology and Adaptation | pages = 41<U+2013>64 | publisher = Springer | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0387-34585-7}}</ref>

Although fewer post-cranial remains have been discovered for ''Hadropithecus'' compared to ''Archaeolemur'', what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] lifestyle, with short limbs and a powerful build.<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />  Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, ''Hadropithecus'' is thought to have been the more terrestrial of the two.<ref name="NaturalChange6" />  Both genera also have shortened hands and feet that have been described as almost "paw-like."<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />  ''Hadropithecus'' had shorter [[metatarsal]]s and limbs, as well as a broader thorax.  Its [[phalange]]s were also more curved than those of baboons.<ref name="NaturalChange8" />

<!-- Note to Visionholder: Return to Walker's Mammals of the World and page 247 in Natural Change for more details on dentition -->
The face of ''Hadropithecus'' was shortened and adapted to heavy stress from chewing.  The monkey lemurs were known for their highly specialized teeth, but ''Hadropithecus'' went further by specializing in strong grinding.<ref name="NaturalChange8">{{cite book | editor1-last = Goodman | editor1-first = SM | editor2-last = Patterson | editor2-first = BD | last1 = Simons | last1 = Godfrey | first1 = LR | last2 = Jungers | first2 = WL | last3 = Reed | first3 = KE | last4 = Simons | first4 = EL | last5 = Chatrath | first5 = PS | chapter = Chapter 8: Subfossil Lemurs | title = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar | pages = 218<U+2013>256 | publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-1560986829}}</ref>  It had expanded [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s that wore down quickly,<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" /> much like those of [[ungulate]]s,<ref name="Nowak" /> and its posterior [[premolars]] acted like molars to extend the grinding surface.<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />  It also had a robust [[mandible]] to facilitate crushing hard objects.<ref name="NaturalChange8" />  Even the [[incisors]] and strepsirrhine [[toothcomb]] were reduced in this species.<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />  Its [[dental formula]] was: {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=1.1.3.3|total=34}}<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />

==Ecology==
Like all other lemurs, ''Hadropithecus'' was [[Endemism|endemic]] to Madagascar.  Because it died out only recently and is only known from subfossil remains, it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur.<ref name="Sussman4" />  Formerly found only in the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions, it is thought to have been terrestrial or semi-terrestrial, an unusual trait for lemurs.<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /><ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="NaturalChange6" />  Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its [[ecological niche]], and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]] and [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] (or [[CAM photosynthesis|CAM]]) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet.<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /><ref name="Lemurs3" />  Its physiology and [[dentition]] suggest that it was a lot like the [[Gelada|Gelada Baboon]] in locomotion and diet.<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />  It was probably a [[Grazing|manual grazer]] and its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds.<ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="NaturalChange6" />  Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a [[Seed predation|seed predator]].<ref name="Lemurs3" /><ref name="NaturalChange8" />

==Extinction==
Already considered a rare species due to the low number of subfossil finds,<ref name="NaturalChange6" /> ''Hadropithecus'' died out sooner than its sister taxon, ''Archaeolemur''.<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" />  Both species disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, it would have faced more pressure from domestic [[livestock]], introduced [[pigs]], and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin.<ref name="Nowak" />  It disappeared completely from Madagascar around 444<U+2013>772 [[Common Era|CE]].<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" />
