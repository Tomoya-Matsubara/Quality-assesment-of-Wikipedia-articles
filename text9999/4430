'''Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: <U+0639><U+0628><U+062F> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062D><U+0645><U+064A><U+062F> <U+062B><U+0627><U+0646><U+06CC> ''{{unicode|`Abd<U+00FC><U+2019>l-<U+1E24>am<U+012B>d-i <u>s</u><U+00E2>n<U+00EE>}}'', {{lang-tr|<U+0130>kinci Abd<U+00FC>lhamit}}) ([[September 21]], [[1842]] &ndash; [[February 10]], [[1918]]) was the 34th sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He ruled from [[August 31]], [[1876]] until he was deposed on [[April 27]], [[1909]]. He was known as the ''Ulu Hakan'' (Divine Khan) by his supporters and as ''Le Sultan Rouge'' (Red Sultan) by the opposition (the [[Young Turks]] and their foreign supporters).

Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II was the last Ottoman emperor who ruled with unchallenged absolutist powers. Despite the fact that his deposition following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] was hailed by most Ottoman citizens, Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II can be credited for delaying the unavoidable break-up of the Ottoman Empire by at least a few decades through his skill in dealing with the secessionist revolts, and his cunning diplomatic maneuvers by using one European power against the other.

==Personal life==
[[Image:Abdul Hameed II Poetry.gif|right|thumb|150px|Here is a sample of his handwritten poetry, which was taken from the book "My Father Abdul Hameed," written by his daughter Ay<U+015F>e Sultan]]

Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II was the son of Sultan [[Abd<U+00FC>lmecid]] and one of his many wives, the [[Circassians|Circassian]] Tirim<U+00FC>jgan (Virjin) Sultan.<ref>Freely, John - ''Inside the Seraglio'', published 1999, Chapter 15: On the Shores of the Bosphorus</ref> He was a skilled carpenter and personally crafted most of his own furniture, which can be seen today at the Y<U+0131>ld<U+0131>z Palace and Beylerbeyi Palace in Istanbul. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II was also interested in opera and personally wrote the first-ever Turkish translations of many opera classics. He also composed several opera pieces for the ''M<U+0131>z<U+0131>ka-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayun'' which he established, and hosted the famous performers of Europe at the Opera House of Y<U+0131>ld<U+0131>z Palace which was recently restored and featured in the film ''Harem Suare (1999)'' of the Turkish-Italian director [[Ferzan <U+00D6>zpetek]], which begins with the scene of Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II watching a performance. 

In the  opinion of F. A. K. Yasamee:<ref>Ottoman Diplomacy: Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II and the Great Powers 1878 <U+2013> 1888</ref>
{{quote|He was a striking amalgam of determination and timidity, of insight and fantasy, held together by immense practical caution and an instinct for the fundamentals of power. He was frequently underestimated. Judged on his record, he was a formidable domestic poltician and an effective diplomat<ref>F. A. K. Yasamee. Ottoman Diplomacy: Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II and the Great Powers 1878 <U+2013> 1888 p.20</ref>}}

He was also a good wrestler and a 'patron saint' of the wrestlers. He organised wrestling tournaments in the empire and selected wrestlers were invited to the palace. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid personally tried the sportsmen and good ones remained in the palace.

=== Poetry ===
[[Image:Abdul Hameed II Sign.gif|thumb|150px|The [[Tughra]] (Signature) of Abd<U+00FC>lhamid]]

Abd<U+00FC>lhamid was also a poet just like many other Ottoman sultans. One of the sultan's poems translates thus:
{{quote|My lord I know you are the Dear One (Al-Aziz)<br>
... And no one but you are the Dear One<br>
You are the One, and nothing else<br>
My God take my hand in these hard times<br>
My God be my helper in this critical hour}}

==Politics==
Unlike many other Ottoman sultans, Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II traveled to distant countries. Nine years before he took the throne, he accompanied his uncle Sultan [[Abd<U+00FC>laziz]] on his visit to [[Austria]], [[France]] and [[England]] in 1867. 

===Accession to throne, 1876===
[[Image:Ahamid.jpg|thumb|Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II in his later years]]

He succeeded to the [[throne]] following the deposition of his brother [[Murad V|Murad]] on [[August 31]] [[1876]]. He himself was deposed in favor of his brother [[Mehmed V|Mehmed]] in 1909. His brother had no real powers and continued as a figurehead only. At his accession, some commentators were impressed by the fact that he rode practically unattended to the [[Ey<U+00FC>p Sultan Mosque]] where he was given the sword of [[Osman I|Osman]]. Most people expected Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II to have liberal ideas, and some conservatives were inclined to regard him with suspicion as a dangerous reformer. 

He took over [[Default (finance)|default]] in the public funds, and an empty treasury.

===1<sup>st</sup> Constitutional Era, 1876-1877===
{{Seealso|First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Young Ottomans}}
He did not plan and express any goal in his accession speech, however he worked with the [[Young Ottomans]] to realize some form of constitutional arrangements<ref> Roderique H. Davison, Reform in the Ottoman Empire (Princeton, 1963)</ref> This new form in its theoretical space could help to realize a liberal transition with Ismalic arguments, which could balance the [[Tanzimat]]'s imitation of western norms. The political structure of western norms did not work with the centuries old Ottoman political culture, even if the pressure from the Western world was enormous to adapt western ways of political decision making the disharmony in the empire did prove a different view, at least in the eyes of the Sultan. On 23 December 1876, under the shadow of the [[Herzegovinian rebellion|1875 insurrection in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the war with [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and the feeling aroused throughout Europe by the cruelty used in stamping out the [[April Uprising|Bulgarian rebellion]], he declared the constitution and its parliament. 

The international conference which met at [[Istanbul]] towards the end of 1876 was surprised by the promulgation of a constitution, but European powers at the conference rejected the constitution as a significant change; they preferred the 1856 constitution, the ''[[Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayun]]'' and 1839 [[Hatt-i Sharif|''Hatt-<U+0131> <U+015E>erif'' of G<U+00FC>lhane]], but questioned whether there was need for a parliament to act as an official voice of the people.

In any event, like many other would-be reforms of the Ottoman Empire change proved to be nearly impossible. Russia continued to mobilize for war. However, everything changed when the British fleet approached the capital from the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Sultan suspended (but did not abolish) the constitution and [[Midhat Pasha]], its author, was exiled  soon afterwards. Early in 1877 the Ottoman Empire [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877<U+2013>1878|went to war]] with the [[Russian Empire]].

===Disintegration===
Abdul Hamid's biggest fear, near dissolution, was coming to effect by the Russians declaration of  war on [[24 April]] 1877 and  following Russian victory by February 1878. Abdul Hamid did not find any help. The chancellor [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] had effectively purchased Austrian neutrality with the [[Reichstadt Agreement]], and the United Kingdom, though still fearing the Russian threat to British dominance in Southern Asia, did not involve herself in the conflict. [[Treaty of San Stefano]] imposed harsh terms: the Ottoman Empire gave independence to [[Principality of Romania|Romania]], Serbia, and Montenegro; to grant autonomy to Bulgaria; to institute reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and to cede the [[Dobruja]] and parts of [[Armenia]] to Russia, which would also be paid an enormous indemnity. Abdul Hamid was the first to recognize and acknowledge the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] nation in European Turkey with the '''Irade''' document, signed on May 23 1905, which today is celebrated as the National Day of the Aromanians. 

As Russia could dominate the newly independent states, her influence in Southeastern Europe was greatly increased by the Treaty of San Stefano. Due to the insistence of the Great Powers (especially the United Kingdom), the treaty was later revised at the [[Congress of Berlin]] so as to reduce the great advantages acquired by Russia. In exchange of these favors, [[Cyprus]] was "rented" to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1878 while the British forces occupied [[History of modern Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] in 1882 with the pretext of "bringing order" to those provinces. Cyprus, Egypt and Sudan remained as Ottoman provinces "on paper" until 1914, when Britain officially annexed those territories in response to the Ottoman participation in [[World War I]] at the side of the [[Central Powers]].

* There was also trouble in Egypt, where a discredited ''[[khedive]]'' had to be deposed. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid mishandled relations with [[Ahmed Urabi|Urabi Pasha]], and as a result Great Britain gained virtual control over Egypt by sending its troops with the pretext of "bringing order".
* There were problems on the [[Greece|Greek]] frontier and in [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], where the European powers were determined that the decisions of the [[Berlin Congress]] should be carried into effect. 
* The [[Bulgarian unification|union]] in 1885 of [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] with [[Eastern Rumelia]] was another blow. The creation of an independent and powerful Bulgaria was viewed as a serious threat to the Ottoman Empire. For many years Abd<U+00FC>lhamid had to deal with Bulgaria in a way that did not antagonize either Russian or German wishes.

[[Crete]] was granted ''extended privileges'', but these did not satisfy the population, which sought unification with [[Greece]]. In early 1897 a Greek expedition sailed to Crete to overthrow Ottoman rule in the island. This act was followed by war, in which the Ottoman Empire defeated Greece (see the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]]). But a few months later Crete was taken over ''en depot'' by England, France, and Russia. [[Prince George of Greece]] was appointed as ruler and Crete was also lost to the Ottoman Empire .

===Securing Germany's support===
[[Image:Von_der_Goltz.jpg|thumb|Colmar Baron von der Goltz (1843-1916)]]
[[Image:Bodo-Borries von Ditfurth.jpg|thumb|Bodo-Borries von Ditfurth (1852-1915)]]

The [[Triple Entente]] - that is, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] - maintained strained relations with the Ottoman Empire. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid and his close advisors believed the empire should be treated as an equal player by these great powers. In the Sultan's view, the Ottoman Empire was a European empire, distinct for having more Muslims than Christians. Abul Hamid and his divan viewed themselves as modern, however their actions were often construed by Europeans as exotic or uncivilized.<ref>Selim Deringil "The Well-Protected Domains: Ideology and the Legitimation of Power in the Ottoman Empire, 1876-1909" p 139-150</ref>

Abd<U+00FC>lhamid now viewed the new [[German Empire]] as a possible friend of the empire. [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was twice hosted by Abd<U+00FC>lhamid in [[Istanbul]]; first on October 21, 1889, and nine years later, on October 5, 1898 (Wilhelm II later visited Istanbul for a third time, on October 15, 1917, as a guest of [[Mehmed V]]). German officers (like [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]] and [[Bodo-Borries von Ditfurth|von Ditfurth]]) were employed to oversee the reorganization of the Ottoman army. 

German government officials were brought in to reorganize the Ottoman government's finances. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid tried to take more of the reins of power into his own hands, for he distrusted his ministers. Germany's friendship was not disinterested, and had to be fostered with railway and loan concessions. In 1899 a significant German desire, the [[Baghdad Railway]], was given to them.

===Assassination Attempt===
In [[July 21]], [[1905]], Abd<U+00FC>lhamid was subjected to an assassination attempt. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid was regularly using only the mosque for Friday prayers. This routine gave Armenian separtists, in the command of [[Belgian]] [[anarchist]] [[Edward Jorris]], Kristofor Mikaelyan which was the field responsible, Robina, Nishan Minasian, Migirdic Serkis Garibyan, Karabet Ohanesyan, Vahram Sabun Kendiryan, Silviyorici, Sari Torkom and Trase Yuvanovic the chance to place a clock operated bombed car with over 80 kg explosives with 20 kg iron pieces to act as sharapnels in front of the mosque.<ref>[http://www.bilgilik.com/makale/tarih/suikastler_tarihi/ii__abdulhamit_suikasti_odev.html Abd<U+00FC>lhamid suikasti]</ref> Two of the assassins, Kristofor Mikaelyan and his so-called daughter Robina, has observed Abd<U+00FC>lhamid's routine for weeks. The distance between the point Sultan gets on his car and the first stairs of the mosque was walked about 1 minute 42 seconds, and the bomb was set according to this figure. In the day of the action, [[Abd<U+00FC>lhamid]] started chatting with Seyhulislam Cemalettin Efendi, and was late to arrive to the explosion point. The bomb exploded at the right time, killing 26, wounding 58 and crushing 17 cars and 20 horses. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid got away without a scratch.

===2<sup>nd</sup> Constitutional Era, 1908===
{{Seealso|Young Turk Revolution|Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Young Turks}}
The national humiliation of the situation in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], together with the resentment in the army against the [[palace]] spies and informers, at last brought matters to a crisis. 

In the summer of 1908 the [[Young Turk]] revolution broke out and Abd<U+00FC>lhamid, upon learning that the troops in [[Salonica]] were marching on [[Istanbul]] ([[July 23]]), at once capitulated. On [[July 24|the 24th]] an ''irade'' announced the restoration of the suspended constitution of 1876; the next day, further ''irades'' abolished [[espionage]] and [[censorship]], and ordered the release of [[political prisoner]]s. 

On [[December 17]], Abd<U+00FC>lhamid opened the Turkish parliament with a speech from the throne in which he said that the first [[parliament]] had been "temporarily dissolved until the education of the people had been brought to a sufficiently high level by the extension of instruction throughout the empire." No significant educational reforms had taken place over the previous 30 years.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Countercoup, 1909===
{{Seealso|Countercoup (1909)|31 March Incident|}}
The new attitude of the sultan did not save him from the suspicion of intriguing with the powerful reactionary elements in the state, a suspicion confirmed by his attitude towards the counter-revolution of [[April 13]], [[1909]] known as ''[[31 Mart Vakas<U+0131>]]'', when an insurrection of the soldiers backed by a conservative public upheaval in the capital overthrew the cabinet. The government, restored by soldiers from Salonica, decided on Abd<U+00FC>lhamid's deposition, and on [[April 27]] his brother Reshad Efendi was proclaimed as Sultan [[Mehmed V]].

==Ideology and Progress==
===Reforms===
At his accession, some commentators were impressed by the fact that he rode practically unattended to the [[Ey<U+00FC>p Sultan Mosque]] where he was given the sword of [[Osman I|Osman]]. Most people expected Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II to have liberal ideas, and some conservatives were inclined to regard him with suspicion as a dangerous reformer. In the event, like many other would-be reformers of the Ottoman Empire, change proved to be nearly impossible. [[Default (finance)|Default]] in the public funds, an empty treasury, the [[Herzegovinian rebellion|1875 insurrection in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the war with [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] and the feeling aroused throughout Europe by the cruelty used in stamping out the [[Bulgaria]]n rebellion all proved good reasons not to undertake any significant changes. 

There were many setbacks: 

* Financial embarrassments forced him to consent to a foreign control over the national debt. In a decree issued in December 1881, a large portion of the empire's revenues were handed over to the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Public Debt Administration]] for the benefit of (mostly foreign) bondholders. 

Over the years Abd<U+00FC>lhamid succeeded in reducing his ministers to the position of secretaries, and he concentrated much of the administration of the Empire into his own hands at [[Yildiz|Y<U+0131>ld<U+0131>z Palace]]. But internal dissension was not reduced. [[Crete]] was constantly in turmoil. The Greeks living within the Ottoman Empire's borders were dissatisfied, as were the Armenians.

His distrust for the reformist admirals of the Ottoman navy (whom he suspected of plotting against him and trying to bring back the 1876 constitution) and his subsequent decision to lock the Ottoman fleet (which ranked as the 3rd largest fleet in the world during the reign of his predecessor [[Abd<U+00FC>laziz]]) inside the [[Golden Horn]] caused the loss of Ottoman overseas territories and islands in [[North Africa]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]] during and after his reign.<ref>http://www.dzkk.tsk.mil.tr/English/Tarihce.asp Turkish Naval History: The Period of the Navy Ministry</ref>

===Question of Islam===
{{seealso|Ottoman Caliphate}}
Abd<U+00FC>lhamid recognized that the ideas [[Tanzimat]] could not bring the disparate peoples of the empire to common identity, such as [[Ottomanism]]. The Russia's pan-Slavism, pan-Hellennism, was stronger than [[Ottomanism]], in the Ottoman Empire. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid tried to hold on formulation of a new and more relevant ideological principle. Ottoman sultans beginning with 1571 were also Caliphs. He wanted to put forward that fact, so he emphasized the [[Ottoman Caliphate]]. 

Abd<U+00FC>lhamid always resisted the pressure of the European powers to the last moment, in order to seem to yield only to overwhelming force, while posing as the champion of [[Islam]] against aggressive [[Christendom]]. Panislamic propaganda was encouraged; the privileges of foreigners in the Ottoman Empire, which were often seen as an obstacle to government, were curtailed. Along with the strategically important [[Baghdad Railway|Istanbul-Baghdad Railway]], the [[Hejaz railway|Istanbul-Medina Railway]] was also completed -making the [[Hajj]] somewhat easier- though there was still a {{convert|160|mi|km|-1|sing=on}} camel ride to get to [[Mecca]]. Emissaries were sent to distant countries preaching Islam and the ''[[Caliph]]'s'' supremacy. During his rule, Abd<U+00FC>lhamid refused [[Theodor Herzl]]'s offers to pay down a substantial portion of the Ottoman debt in exchange for a charter allowing the [[Zionists]] to colonize [[Palestine]].

Abd<U+00FC>lhamid's appeals to Muslim sentiment were powerless against widespread disaffection within his Empire due to perennial misgovernment. In [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Yemen]] disturbance was endemic; nearer home, a semblance of loyalty was maintained in the army and among the [[Muslim]] population only by a system of delation and espionage, and by wholesale arrests. After his rule began, Abd<U+00FC>lhamid became obsessed with the paranoia of being assassinated and withdrew himself into the fortified seclusion of the Y<U+0131>ld<U+0131>z Palace.

=== Armenian Question ===
{{main|Yildiz Attempt|Armenian Rebellions|Hamidian massacres}}

Starting around 1890 the Armenians began clamoring to obtain the reforms which were promised at Berlin.<ref>http://www.armenica.org/cgi-bin/history/en/getHistory.cgi?5=1=254=Latest%20updates=Armenian%20Question=1=3=A</ref> Unrest occurred in 1892 and 1893 at Merzifon and Tokat. Armenian groups staged protests and were met by violence. Sultan Abd<U+00FC>lhamid did not hesitate to put down these revolts with harsh methods, possibly to show the unshakable power of the monarch, and often used the local [[Muslim]]s (in most cases the Kurds) against the Armenians.<ref>[http://www.crf-usa.org/bria/bria19_3b.htm Constitutional Rights Foundation]</ref>. According to Turkish scholar [[Taner Ak<U+00E7>am]], [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of [[Germany]] claimed that eighty thousand Armenians had been killed, and [[France|French]] reports claimed that two hundred thousand had been killed.<ref>Ak<U+00E7>am, Taner: A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility, transl. Paul Bessemer, Metropolitan Books, New York. 2006</ref> In 1907, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] attempted to assassinate him. Surviving the assassination, he eased his orders of purges against the Armenians.

==Deposition and aftermath==
[[Image:Abdul Hameed II Removal.gif|right|thumb|250px|A rare picture showing Abd<U+00FC>lhamid and the four people when he was told he was removed from office]]

The ex-sultan was conveyed into dignified captivity at [[Salonica]]. In 1912, when Salonica fell to Greece, he was returned to captivity in Istanbul. He spent his last days studying, carpentering and writing his memoirs in custody at [[Beylerbeyi|Beylerbeyi Palace]], where he died on [[February 10]] [[1918]], just a few months before his brother, the sultan. Abd<U+00FC>lhamid was the last relatively autonomous sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He presided over thirty three years of decline. The Ottoman Empire had long been acknowledged as the [[Sick Man of Europe]]. While its European neighbours were making railroads, automobiles, electric lights and even airplanes, the Ottoman Empire was unable to develop such advanced industry. The Ottoman subjects rarely saw the benefits of the attempted reforms carried out under the Sultan's reign.

===Pictures from Empire===
Abd<U+00FC>lhamid commissioned thousands of photographs of his empire. Fearful of assassination, he did not travel often (though still more than many previous rulers) and photographs provided visual evidence of what was taking place in his realm. The [[Sultan]] presented large gift albums of photographs to various governments and heads of state, including the [[United States]] (William Allen, "The Abdul Hamid II Collection," History of Photography eight (1984): 119-45.) and Great Britain (M. I. Waley and  British Library, "Sultan Abdulhamid II Early Turkish Photographs in 51 Albums from the British Library on Microfiche" (Zug, Switzerland: IDC, 1987). The American collection is housed in the [[Library of Congress]] and has been digitized. *[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/ahiiquery.html Ottoman Empire photographs at the Library of Congress]

===Policies in caricatures===
Abd<U+00FC>lhamid's era had seen an upsurge of [[political satire]]. Inside and outside the empire, Abd<U+00FC>lhamid's cunning but harsh policies, or propaganda against Abd<U+00FC>lhamid's activities, were reflected in many caricatures.
