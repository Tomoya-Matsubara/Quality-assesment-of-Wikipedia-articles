'''Samuel Wells Williams''' (<U+885B><U+4E09><U+754F>; 22 September 1812 - February 16, 1884) was a [[linguistics|linguist]], official, [[missionary]] and [[Sinology|Sinologist]] from the United States in the early 19th century.

==Biography==
Williams was born in [[Utica, New York]] and studied at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]]. On graduation he was elected as a Professor of the Institute.

On the June 15, 1833, and still in his twenties, he sailed for China to take charge of the printing press of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] at [[Guangdong]], China. In 1837 he sailed on the [[Morrison Incident|Morrison]] to Japan. Officially this trip was to return some stranded Japanese sailors, but it was also an unsuccessful attempt to open Japan to [[American trade]].

On November 20, 1845 Williams married Sarah Walworth. From 1848 to 1851 Williams was the editor of [[The Chinese Repository]], a leading Western journal published in China. In 1853 he was attached to Commodore [[Matthew Calbraith Perry]]'s expedition to Japan as an official interpreter.

In 1855, Williams was appointed Secretary of the United States Legation to China. During his stay in China, he wrote ''A Tonic Dictionary Of The Chinese Language In The Canton Dialect'' (<U+82F1><U+83EF><U+5206><U+97FB><U+64AE><U+8981>) in 1856. After years of opposition from the [[Qing dynasty|Chinese government]], Williams was instrumental in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which provided for the toleration of both Chinese and foreign Christians.

In 1860, he was appointed [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]] for the United States in Beijing. He resigned his position on October 25, 1876, 43 years to the day that he first landed at [[Guangzhou]] in 1833. Around 1875, he completed a translation of the [[Book of Genesis]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew]] into Japanese, but the manuscripts were lost in a fire before they could be published.

He returned to the United States in 1877 and became the first Professor of Chinese language and [[Chinese literature]] in the United States at [[Yale University]]. Williams was nominated as president of the [[American Bible Society]] on February 3, 1881. He died on February 16, 1884.
