}}'''Leonard Hyman Tose''' ([[March 6]], [[1915]] - [[April 15]], [[2003]]) Born in [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania]], made a fortune in the [[trucking]] industry and was owner of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  He was known for his lavish lifestyle and  eventually lost his fortune because of a [[gambling addiction]] and [[alcoholism]].  

== Early Years ==
His father, who came to the United States from Russia, settled outside [[Philadelphia]] and was a peddler with a pack on his back. He eventually owned 10 trucks, the beginning of the family business. Eventually, Tose Inc. owned more than 700 trucks and grossed $20 million a year.

== Philadelphia Eagles Owner ==
In 1969 Tose bought the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from [[Jerry Wolman]] for $16,155,000[http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf ], then a record for a professional sports franchise.  Tose's first official act was to fire Coach [[Joe Kuharich]].  He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great [[Pete Retzlaff]] as [[General Manager]] and [[Jerry Williams]] as coach.  

In 1976 he, along with [[General Manager]] [[Jim Murray (football)|Jimmy Murray]], lured [[Dick Vermeil]] from [[UCLA]] to coach the hapless Eagles, who had one winning season from 1962-75. Vermeil's 1980 team lost to [[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]] in the [[Super Bowl]].   In January 1983, Tose announced that his daughter, Susan Fletcher, the Eagles' vice president and legal counsel, would eventually succeed him as primary owner of the Eagles. 

In 1985 Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to [[Norman Braman]] and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from [[Florida]], for a reported $65 million to pay off his more than $25 million in gambling debts at [[Atlantic City]] casinos.

== Lifestyle ==
A slim, suave man who was always well dressed, Mr. Tose was, by his admission, a compulsive gambler and an alcoholic with a lifestyle others called flamboyant and he called comfortable. He and the fourth of his five wives had matching Rolls-Royces.  Mr. Tose flew to Eagles home games in a helicopter, was married aboard the liner Queen Elizabeth 2 and fed reporters filet mignon and shrimp cocktail.

== After the Eagles ==
In 1991, the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands]] sued him for $1.23 million in gambling debts.  He countersued, contending that the casino got him too drunk to know what he was doing. Eventually, the casino won.  There was testimony from a cocktail waitress swearing that her job description was "to keep Mr. Tose's glass filled."  A monogrammed glass, courtesy of the casino, which she kept filled with top-shelf scotch.  

In the end, he lost it all, by his estimate more than $20 million at Resorts International and $14 million at the Sands. In 1996, on his 81st birthday, Tose was evicted from his seven-bedroom [[Villanova]] mansion after losing the house in a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal's]] sale.

In 1999, he told a congressional hearing on compulsive gambling that his losses totaled between $40 million and $50 million.  He spent his last years alone in a [[Center City Philadelphia|downtown]] hotel room.  Mr. Tose died in his sleep in the hospice wing of St. Agnes Medical Center in [[Philadelphia]]. He was 88.  An obituary by Dan Dunkin captured his life: "To put Leonard Tose's life in football terms, he threw on every down."*
