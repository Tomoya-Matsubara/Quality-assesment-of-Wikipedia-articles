'''Loveland''' is a [[Colorado municipalities#Home Rule Municipality|Home Rule Municipality]] that is the second most populous city in [[Larimer County, Colorado]], [[United States]]. Loveland is situated {{convert|46|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north of the [[Colorado State Capitol]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Loveland is the [[Colorado municipalities by population|14th most populous city]] in [[Colorado]]. The [[United States Census Bureau]] that in 2010 the population of the city of Loveland was 66,859. The city forms part of the [[Fort Collins-Loveland Metropolitan Statistical Area]], as well as the [[Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area]] and the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]]. The city's public schools are part of the [[Thompson R2-J School District]].

==History==
The city was founded in 1877 along the newly-constructed line of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]], near its crossing of the [[Big Thompson River]]. It was named in honor of [[William A.H. Loveland]], the president of the Colorado Central Railroad. The city was founded one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) upstream from the existing small settlement of St. Louis, the buildings of which were moved to the site of Loveland. For the first half of the 20th century the town was dependent on agriculture. The primary crops in the area were [[sugar beet]]s and [[sour cherries]]. In 1901, the [[Great Western Sugar Company]] built a factory in Loveland, which remained as a source of employment until its closure in 1985. During the late 1920s the Spring Glade orchard was the largest cherry orchard west of the [[Mississippi River]]. At that time the cherry orchards produced more than [[United States dollar|$]]1 million worth of [[cherry|cherries]] per year. A series of droughts, attacks of blight and finally a killer freeze destroyed the industry. By 1960 cherries were no longer farmed. In the late 20th century, the economy diversified with the arrival of manufacturing facilities by [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Teledyne]], and Hach, a [[water quality]] analysis equipment manufacturer. A new [[Hospital|medical center]] has added a substantial amount of employment in that sector as well.

The city is south of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], its larger neighbor and the county seat. The two cities have been steadily growing towards each other over the last several decades and are considered to be a single metropolitan area by the U.S. government. The establishment of county-owned open space between the two communities in the 1990s was intended to create a permanent buffer to contiguous growth. Loveland has aggressively expanded its incorporated limits eastward to embrace the interchange of [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] and [[U.S. Highway 34 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 34]], and is currently developing the area. In the last decade, the intersection has become a primary commercial hub of [[northern Colorado]], with the construction of shopping centers and the [[Budweiser Events Center]]. A [http://www.bannerhealth.com/Locations/Colorado/McKee+Medical+Center/_McKee+Medical+Center+Home.htm new medical center] and [http://www.thepromenadeshopsatcenterra.com/index.cfm mall] have also been built on the [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] and [[U.S. Highway 34 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 34]] interchange. This area is known as Centerra. The interchange is shared with its smaller neighbor [[Johnstown, Colorado|Johnstown]], of [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld County]].

==Geography and climate==

The Loveland-Ft Collins metropolitan area has received numerous awards as a great place to live, by [[Money Magazine]], [[USA Today]], [[AARP the Magazine]], and others. There is a large population of artists in Loveland, which has drawn three [[foundry|foundries]], an [[art museum]], and the annual sculpture shows in August. Loveland has a reputation as being somewhat conservative in its politics, with a large and active population of [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelical Christians]]. The city is a major [http://www.loveland.org/ business center for northern Colorado]. 

The city is located in the [[Colorado Front Range]] region at the base of the foothills just east of the mouth of [[Big Thompson River]] Canyon at the intersection of [[U.S. Highway 34 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 34]] and [[U.S. Highway 287 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 287]]. [[Longs Peak]] and other mountains of the [[Front Range]] are visible from much of the city. Lake Loveland, an early agricultural reservoir in the [[irrigation]] system of the region, is located in the city limits and provides a recreational facility for the city residents.

In addition, the city serves as a "bedroom" community to commuters in many directions: to employment locations in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Westminster, Colorado|Westminster]] and other parts of the [[Denver metropolitan area|Denver Metropolitan area]]; and also to the college towns of [[Fort Collins]] ([[Colorado State University|CSU]]), [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]] ([[University of Northern Colorado|UNC]]), and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], ([[University of Colorado at Boulder|CU]]).

==The Valentine Re-Mailing Program==
Loveland is the home of the [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]] Re-Mailing Program. For decades people from across the world have sent their valentines to Loveland, Colorado, to be hand-stamped with a cachet and verse, and a specially designed postal cancelation. A new verse and stamp are selected each year through a contest held by the Loveland Chamber of Commerce and residents can submit their poems and artwork to be judged. On average, this program re-mails more than 160,000 cards from the United States and more than 110 countries. Loveland<U+2019>s Valentine Re-mailing Program has inspired many other Valentine<U+2019>s Day programs including the Official Loveland Valentine, Miss Loveland Valentine and the Thompson Valley Rotary Heart<U+2019>s Program. Information on all these programs is available through the [http://www.loveland.org/valentineprogram Loveland Chamber of Commerce website]. The Loveland Chamber of Commerce and the Loveland Post Office sponsor the Loveland Valentine Re-mailing Program.

Loveland<U+2019>s Valentine Re-mailing Program began in January 1947 by Ted Thompson and Elmer Ivers, the Loveland postmaster after Ivers received about 30 valentines from individuals requesting to have the cards postmarked from Loveland for, <U+201C>a romantic extra touch.<U+201D> The two thought re-mailing valentines would be an opportunity to advertise Loveland, and the Loveland Chamber of Commerce agreed to promote the service. Thompson designed a cachet with the message, <U+201C>A Valentine Greeting from Sweetheart Town, Loveland, Colorado,<U+201D> and the image was a heart pierced by an arrow over the Rocky Mountains. The cachet was used twice, then Thompson started the tradition of changing it each year at the request of collectors. Since then, a different verse and design have been used every year.

==The public arts program==
Loveland has just under 300 pieces of art in its public arts collection. The arts collection consists primarily of sculpture; however, the collection also includes murals and other flat work. Over 100 pieces of the city's sculpture can be found in Loveland's [http://www.ci.loveland.co.us/parksrec/Benson.htm Benson Sculpture Garden]. 

The ''Sculpture in the Park'' show, hosted by the Loveland High Plains Arts Council, takes place annually in August and exhibits artwork from artists from the United States and the world.
