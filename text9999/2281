Prior to its uniform adoption of [[proportional representation]] in 1999, the [[United Kingdom]] used [[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] for the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The [[European Parliament constituency|European Parliament constituencies]] used under that system were smaller than the later regional constituencies and only had one [[Member of the European Parliament]] each. 

The constituency of '''Strathclyde West''' was one of them.

When it was created in Scotland in 1979, it consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|Westminster Parliament constituencies]] of [[Bute and North Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Bute and North Ayrshire]], [[Dunbartonshire Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunbartonshire Central]], [[Dunbartonshire East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunbartonshire East]], [[Dunbartonshire West (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunbartonshire West]], [[Greenock and Port Glasgow (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenock and Port Glasgow]], [[Paisley (UK Parliament constituency)|Paisley]], [[Renfrewshire East (UK Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire East]], and [[Renfrewshire West (UK Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire West]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ |title=David Boothroyd's United Kingdom Election Results |accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>  although this may not have been true for the whole of its existence.

The seat was basically traditional Labour territory, but because of the Conservative landslide at the first European election in 1979 Adam Fergusson narrowly defeated the Labour candidate Valerie Friel.  Labour won it at all subsequent elections.
