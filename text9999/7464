{{Chinese name|Li ({{zh-cp|c=<U+674E>|p=L<U+01D0>}})}}
'''Li Jiawei''' ({{zh-cp|c=<U+674E><U+4F73><U+8587>|p=L<U+01D0> Ji<U+0101>w<U+0113>i}}) (born 9 August 1981) is a [[People's Republic of China|China]]-born [[Singapore]]an [[table tennis]] player who is ranked among the top ten athletes in her sport.

The medal came 48&nbsp;years after [[Tan Howe Liang]] won the country's first medal, a silver in weightlifting at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]].

==Personal life==
Li first met Singaporean badminton player and fellow Olympian [[Ronald Susilo]] in 2002 at a sports meet.<ref name="ST 20061022"/> They began dating after participating together in the Athens Olympics, and the "golden sports couple",<ref name=AsiaOne>{{citation|title=Golden couple Susilo and Li Jiawei break up|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Sports/Story/A1Story20080116-45299.html|publisher=AsiaOne|date=[[2008-01-16]]|accessdate=2008-08-18}}.</ref> as they were dubbed by the media, announced their engagement in September 2004. About two years later there were rumours that they were breaking up, but these were denied by them at the time.<ref name="ST 20061022"/> On 15 January 2008, when queried by a journalist, Susilo confirmed that he and Li had broken up amicably the previous week.<ref name=AsiaOne/> Following a report in ''[[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]]'' that Susilo was contemplating legal action against her to recover money he claimed to have spent in buying their condominium apartment and car, Li disagreed that Susilo had a share in the apartment and implied he was trying to affect her mood and thus her chances of winning a medal at the Beijing Olympics. Susilo declined to discuss the matter with the press, saying it was a private matter between Li and himself; he wished her all the best for the Olympics.<ref>{{citation|author=Terrence Voon|title=Li Jiawei speaks out against ex-fiance|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Story/A1Story20080409-58989.html|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (reproduced on AsiaOne)|date=[[2008-04-09]]}}.
