Manson is associated with "[[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|Helter Skelter]]," a term he took from the song "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]," written and recorded by [[The Beatles]]. Manson misconstrued the lyrics to be about an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[race war]] he believed the murders were intended to precipitate. From the beginning of his notoriety, this connection with rock music linked him with a [[pop culture]] in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity, violence and the [[macabre]]. The term was later used by Manson prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]] as the title of [[Helter Skelter (book)|a book]] he wrote about the Manson murders.

At the time the Family began to form, Manson was an unemployed [[ex-convict]], who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses. Before the murders, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with [[Dennis Wilson]], founding member and drummer of [[The Beach Boys]]. After Manson was charged with the crimes he was later convicted of, recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially. Artists, including [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Marilyn Manson]], have [[cover version|covered]] his songs.

Manson's [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] was automatically [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]] when a 1972 decision by the [[Supreme Court of California]] temporarily eliminated the state's death penalty.<ref>[http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=48 History of California's Death Penalty] deathpenalty.org. Retrieved March 28, 2009.</ref> California's eventual reinstatement of [[capital punishment]] did not affect Manson, who is currently incarcerated at [[Corcoran State Prison]].

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Born to an unmarried 16-year-old named Kathleen Maddox, in [[Cincinnati]] General Hospital, [[Ohio]], Manson was first dubbed "no name Maddox."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}}<ref>Emmons, Nuel.

For a period after his birth, his mother was married to a laborer named William Manson,<ref name="birthcert" /> whose last name the boy was given. The boy's biological father appears to have been a "Colonel Scott," against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a [[Legitimacy (law)|bastardy]] suit that resulted in an [[stipulated judgment|agreed judgment]] in 1937.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}} Possibly, the boy never really knew him.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}}<ref name="mom" />

Several statements in Manson's 1951 case file from the seven months he would later spend at the [[National Training School for Boys]] in Washington, D.C., allude to the possibility that "Colonel Scott" was African American.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|555}} These include the first two sentences of his family background section, which read: "Father: unknown. He is alleged to have been a [[colored]] cook by the name of Scott, with whom the boy's mother had been [[promiscuous]] at the time of pregnancy."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|556}} When asked about these official records by attorney Vincent Bugliosi in 1971, Manson emphatically denied that his biological father had African American ancestry.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|588}}

In the quasi-autobiography, ''[[Manson in His Own Words]]'', Colonel Scott is said to have been "a young [[drugstore cowboy]] ... a [[transient laborer]] working on a nearby dam project." It is not clear what "nearby" means. The description is in a paragraph that indicates Kathleen Maddox gave birth to Manson "while living in [[Cincinnati]]," after she had run away from her own home, in [[Ashland, Kentucky]].<ref>Emmons, Nuel. ''Manson in His Own Words''. Grove Press, New York; 1988. ISBN 0-8021-3024-0. Pages 28<U+2013>29.</ref>

Manson's mother was allegedly a [[alcoholic|heavy drinker]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}} According to a family member, she once sold her son for a pitcher of beer to a childless waitress, from whom his uncle retrieved him some days later.<ref name="emmons">Emmons, Nuel. ''Manson in His Own Words''. Grove Press, New York; 1988. ISBN 0-8021-3024-0</ref> When Manson's mother and her brother were sentenced to five years' imprisonment for robbing a [[Charleston, West Virginia]], service station in 1939, Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in [[McMechen, West Virginia]]. Upon her 1942 [[parole]], Kathleen retrieved her son and lived with him in run-down hotel rooms.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}} Manson himself later characterized her physical embrace of him on the day she returned from prison as his sole happy childhood memory.<ref name="emmons" />

In 1947, Kathleen Maddox tried to have her son placed in a [[Foster care|foster home]] but failed because no such home was available.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}} The court placed Manson in [[Gibault School for Boys]], in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. After 10 months, he fled from there to his mother, who rejected him.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}}

===First offenses===
By committing burglary<!-- These were BURGLARIES, ''not'' ROBBERIES; American English should be used for this article. --> of a [[grocery store]], Manson obtained cash that enabled him to rent a room.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|136<U+2013>7}} A string of burglaries of other stores, including one from which he stole a bicycle, ended when he was caught in the act. He was sent to an [[Indianapolis]] juvenile center. His escape after one day led to his recapture and his placement in [[Girls and Boys Town|Boys Town]]. Four days after his arrival there, he escaped with another boy. The pair committed two [[armed robbery|armed robberies]] on their way to the home of the other boy's uncle.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

Caught during the second of two subsequent break-ins of grocery stores, Manson was sent, at age 13, to the [[Plainfield Juvenile Correctional Facility|Indiana Boys School]], where, he would later claim, he was [[sexual abuse|brutalized sexually]] and otherwise.<ref name="emmons" /> After many failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in 1951.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

In [[Utah]], the three were caught driving to California in cars they had stolen. They had burglarized<!-- These were BURGLARIES, ''not'' ROBBERIES; American English should be used for this article. --> several [[gas station]]s along the way. For the [[federal crime]] of taking a stolen car across a state line, Manson was sent to Washington, D.C.'s [[National Training School for Boys]]. Despite four years of schooling and an [[Intelligence quotient|I.Q.]] of 109 (later tested at 121),<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} he was [[illiterate]]. A [[caseworker (social work)|caseworker]] deemed him aggressively [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

===First imprisonment===
In October 1951, on a psychiatrist's recommendation, Manson was transferred to [[Natural Bridge Honor Camp]], a minimum security institution. Less than a month before a scheduled February 1952 [[parole]] hearing, he "took a razor blade and held it against another boy's throat while he [[sodomy|sodomized]] him."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}<ref name="emmons" /> He was transferred to the Federal Reformatory, [[Petersburg, Virginia]], where he was considered "dangerous."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} In September 1952, a number of other serious disciplinary offenses resulted in his transfer to the [[Chillicothe Correctional Institution|Federal Reformatory]] at [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]], Ohio, a more secure institution.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}
About a month after the transfer, he became almost a model resident. Good work habits and a rise in his educational level from the lower fourth to the upper seventh grade won him a May 1954 parole.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

After temporarily honoring a parole condition that he live with his aunt and uncle in [[West Virginia]], Manson moved in with his mother in that same state. In January 1955, he married a hospital waitress named [[Rosalie Jean Willis]], with whom, by his own account, he found genuine, if short-lived, marital happiness.<ref name="emmons" /> He supported their marriage via small-time jobs and [[motor vehicle theft|auto theft]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle interstate. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' [[probation]]. His subsequent failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March 1956 arrest in [[Indianapolis]]. His probation was revoked; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], San Pedro, California.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

While Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son, Charles Manson, Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was subsequently given five years [[probation]], and his parole was denied.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

===Second imprisonment===
Manson received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was [[pimp]]ing a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged [[U.S. Treasury]] check. He received a 10-year [[suspended sentence]] and probation after a young woman with an arrest record for prostitution made a "tearful plea" before the court that she and Manson were "deeply in love... and would marry if Charlie were freed."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so testimony against him [[Spousal testimonial privilege|would not be required]] of her.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

The woman's name was Leona; as a prostitute, she had used the name Candy Stevens. After Manson took her and another woman from California to [[New Mexico]] for purposes of prostitution, he was held and questioned for violation of the [[Mann Act]]. Though he was released, he evidently suspected, rightly, that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared, in violation of his probation, a [[bench warrant]] was issued; an April 1960 indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} Arrested in [[Laredo, Texas]], in June, when one of the women was arrested for prostitution, Manson was returned to Los Angeles. For violation of his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his 10-year sentence.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

In July 1961, after a year spent unsuccessfully appealing the revocation of his probation, Manson was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at [[McNeil Island]]. Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. His September 1961 annual review noted he had a "tremendous drive to call attention to himself," an observation echoed in September 1964.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce, in the pursuit of which she alleged that she and Manson had had a son, Charles Luther.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}

In June 1966, Manson was sent, for the second time in his life, to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], in preparation for early release. By March 21, 1967, his release day, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} a fact touched on in a 1981 television interview with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>[http://www.charliemanson.com/tom-snyder-1981.htm 1981 Tom Snyder interview with Charles Manson]. Transcribed by Aaron Bredlau. CharlieManson.com. Retrieved April 26, 2007.</ref>

==Manson Family==
On his release day, Manson received permission to move to San Francisco, where, with the help of a prison acquaintance, he moved into an apartment in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. In prison, bank robber [[Alvin Karpis]] had taught him to play [[steel guitar]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}}<ref name="emmons" /><ref>Karpis, Alvin, with Robert Livesey. ''On the Rock: Twenty-five Years at Alcatraz'', 1980</ref> Now, living mostly by [[panhandling]], he soon got to know [[Mary Brunner]], a 23-year-old graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]]. Brunner was working as an assistant librarian at [[UC Berkeley]], and Manson moved in with her. According to a secondhand account, he overcame her resistance to his bringing other women in to live with them. Before long, they were sharing Brunner's residence with 18 other women.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|163<U+2013>174}}

Manson established himself as a [[guru]] in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]], which, during 1967's "[[Summer of Love]]," was emerging as the signature [[hippie]] locale. Expounding a philosophy that included some of the [[Scientology]] he had studied in prison,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|163<U+2013>164}} he soon had his first group of young followers, most of them female.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|137<U+2013>146}} Upon a staff evaluation of Manson when he entered prison in July 1961 at the U.S. penitentiary in [[McNeil Island]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], Manson entered "Scientologist" as his religion.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|143<U+2013>144}}

Before the summer ended, Manson and eight or nine of his enthusiasts piled into an old school bus they had re-wrought in hippie style, with colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed. They roamed as far north as [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]], then southward through Los Angeles, [[Mexico]], and the southwest. Returning to the Los Angeles area, they lived in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], and [[Venice, California|Venice]]<U+2014>western parts of the city and county.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|163<U+2013>174}}

In an alternative account, Manson acquired Family members during some months of travels that were undertaken, in part, in a [[Volkswagen]] van. He was apparently accompanied by Brunner. It was November when the school bus set out from San Francisco with the enlarged group.<ref>Sanders, Ed. ''The Family''. Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, 2002. ISBN 1-56025-396-7. Pages 13<U+2013>20.</ref>

===Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, et al.===
The events that would culminate in the murders were set in motion in late spring 1968, when, by some accounts, [[Dennis Wilson]], of [[The Beach Boys]], picked up two hitchhiking Manson women and brought them to his [[Pacific Palisades]] house for a few hours. Returning home in the early hours of the following morning from a night recording session, Wilson was greeted in the driveway of his own residence by Manson, who emerged from the house. Uncomfortable, Wilson asked the stranger whether he intended to hurt him. Assuring him he had no such intent, Manson began kissing Wilson's feet.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|250<U+2013>253}}<ref name="sanders34">Sanders 2002, p. 34.</ref>

Inside the house, Wilson discovered 12 strangers, mostly women.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|250<U+2013>253}}<ref name="sanders34" /> Over the next few months, as their number doubled, the Family members who had made themselves part of Wilson's [[Sunset Boulevard]] household cost him approximately $100,000. This included a large medical bill for treatment of their [[gonorrhea]] and $21,000 for the accidental destruction of his uninsured car, which they borrowed.<ref name="watkins4">Watkins, Paul with Soledad, Guillermo. ''My Life with Charles Manson'', Bantam, 1979. ISBN 0-553-12788-8. Chapter 4.</ref> Wilson would sing and talk with Manson, whose women were treated as servants to them both.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|250<U+2013>253}}

Wilson paid for studio time to record songs written and performed by Manson, and he introduced Manson to acquaintances of his with roles in the entertainment business. These included [[Gregg Jakobson]], [[Terry Melcher]], and Rudi Altobelli (the last of whom owned a house he would soon rent to actress [[Sharon Tate]] and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]]).<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|250<U+2013>253}} Jakobson, who was impressed by "the whole Charlie Manson package" of artist/lifestylist/philosopher, also paid to record Manson material.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|155<U+2013>161, 185<U+2013>188, 214<U+2013>219}}<ref name="watson9">[http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-009.php Watson, Charles as told to Ray Hoekstra. ''Will You Die for Me?'', Chapter 9] Watson website. Retrieved May 3, 2007.</ref>

In ''Manson in His Own Words'', the account is that Manson first met Wilson at a friend's San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. The Beach Boy supposedly gave Manson his Sunset Boulevard address and invited him to stop by when he would be in Los Angeles.<ref name="emmons" />

===Spahn Ranch===
Manson established a base for the group at [[Spahn Ranch|Spahn's Movie Ranch]] not far from Topanga Canyon in August 1968 after Wilson's manager told the Family to move out of Wilson's home.<ref name="watson6">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-006.php |title=Watson, Ch. 6 |publisher=Aboundinglove.org |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref><ref name="watson7">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-007.php |title=Watson, Ch. 7 |publisher=Aboundinglove.org |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> The entire Family then relocated to the ranch.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|250<U+2013>253}}

The ranch had been a television and movie set for [[Western (genre)|Western]] productions. However, by the late 1960s, the buildings had deteriorated and the ranch was earning money primarily by selling horseback rides.

Family members did helpful work around the grounds. Also, Manson ordered the Family's women, including [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]], to occasionally have sex with the nearly blind, 80-year-old owner, [[George Spahn]]. The women also acted as seeing-eye guides for Spahn. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|99<U+2013>113}}<ref>Watkins, pages 34 & 40.</ref> Squeaky acquired her nickname because she often squeaked when Spahn pinched her thigh.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|163<U+2013>174}}<ref name="watkins4"/>

[[Charles "Tex" Watson|Charles Watson]] soon joined the group at Spahn's ranch. Watson, a small-town [[Texas|Texan]] who had quit college and moved to California,<ref name="watson4">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-004.php |title=Watson, Ch. 4 |publisher=Aboundinglove.org |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> met Manson at Dennis Wilson's house. Watson gave Wilson a ride while Wilson was hitchhiking after his cars had been wrecked.<ref name="watson6" />

Spahn nicknamed Watson "Tex" because of his pronounced Texan drawl.<ref name="watson7" />

===Helter Skelter===
{{Main|Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)}}
In the first days of November 1968, Manson established the Family at alternative headquarters in [[Death Valley]]'s environs, where they occupied two unused or little-used ranches, Myers and Barker.<ref name = "watson9" /><ref name="watkins10">Watkins, Ch. 10.</ref> The former, to which the group had initially headed, was owned by the grandmother of a new woman in the Family. The latter was owned by an elderly, local woman to whom Manson presented himself and a male Family member as musicians in need of a place congenial to their work. When the woman agreed to let them stay there if they'd fix up things, Manson honored her with one of the [[Beach Boys]]' [[gold record]]s,<ref name="watkins10" /> several of which he had been given by [[Dennis Wilson]].<ref name="watkins11">Watkins, Ch. 11</ref>

While back at Spahn Ranch, no later than December, Manson and Watson visited a Topanga Canyon acquaintance who played them the [[The Beatles|Beatles']] [[The Beatles (album)|''White Album'']], then recently released.<ref name="watson9" /><ref>Chapter 1, "Manson," [http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/mrhmso/mrhmso-002.php ''Manson<U+2019>s Right-Hand Man Speaks Out!''].

In early January 1969, the Family escaped the desert's cold and positioned itself to monitor L.A.'s supposed tension by moving to a canary-yellow home in [[Canoga Park]], not far from the Spahn Ranch.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|244<U+2013>247}}<ref name="watkins12" /><ref>Sanders 2002, 99<U+2013>100.</ref> Because this locale would allow the group to remain "submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world,"<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|244<U+2013>247}}<ref>Watkins, p. 137.</ref> Manson called it the [[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]], another Beatles reference. There, Family members prepared for the impending apocalypse,<ref name="watkins13" /><ref name="watson12" /> which, around the campfire, Manson had termed "Helter Skelter," after the [[Helter Skelter (song)|song]] of that name.

By February, Manson's vision was complete. The Family would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the Beatles, would trigger the predicted chaos. Ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation, and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. Blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in "the bottomless pit"<U+2014>a secret city beneath Death Valley.<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansontestimony-w.html Testimony of Paul Watkins in the Charles Manson Trial] UMKC Law.

At the Canoga Park house, while Family members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album. When they were told [[Terry Melcher]] was to come to the house to hear the material, the women prepared a meal and cleaned the place; but Melcher never arrived.<ref name="watson11" /><ref name="watkins13">Watkins, Ch. 13</ref>

===Encounter with Tate===
On March 23, 1969,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233}} Manson entered, uninvited, upon [[10050 Cielo Drive]], which he had known as Melcher's residence.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|155<U+2013>161}} This was Rudi Altobelli's property, where Melcher was no longer the tenant. As of that February,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}} the tenants were [[Sharon Tate]] and [[Roman Polanski]].

Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami, a photographer and Tate's friend. Hatami was there to photograph Tate in advance of her departure for Rome the next day. Having seen Manson through a window as Manson approached the main house, Hatami had gone onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233}}

When Manson told Hatami he was looking for someone whose name Hatami did not recognize, Hatami informed him the place was the Polanski residence. Hatami advised him to try "the back alley," by which he meant the path to the guest house, beyond the main house.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233}} Concerned over the stranger on the property, Hatami was now down on the front walk, to confront Manson. Appearing behind Hatami, in the house's front door, Tate asked him who was calling. Hatami said a man was looking for someone. Hatami and Tate maintained their positions while Manson, without a word, went back to the guest house, returned a minute or two later, and left.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233}}

That evening, Manson returned to the property and again went back to the guest house. Presuming to enter the enclosed porch, he spoke with Rudi Altobelli, who was just coming out of the shower. Although Manson asked for Melcher, Altobelli felt Manson had come looking for him.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|226}} This is consistent with prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]]'s later discovery that Manson had apparently been to the place on earlier occasions after Melcher's departure from it.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233, 369<U+2013>377}}

Speaking through the inner screen door, Altobelli told Manson that Melcher had moved to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. He lied that he did not know Melcher's new address. In response to a question from Manson, Altobelli said he himself was in the entertainment business, although, having met Manson the previous year, at Dennis Wilson's home, he was sure Manson already knew that. At Wilson's, Altobelli had complimented Manson lukewarmly on some of his musical recordings that Wilson had been playing.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233}}

When Altobelli informed Manson he was going out of the country the next day, Manson said he'd like to speak with him upon his return; Altobelli lied that he would be gone for more than a year. In response to a direct question from Altobelli, Manson explained that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house; Altobelli expressed the wish that Manson not disturb his tenants.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233}}

Manson left. As Altobelli flew with Tate to Rome the next day, Tate asked him whether "that creepy-looking guy" had gone back to the guest house the day before.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|228<U+2013>233}}

==Family crimes==
===Crowe shooting===
On May 18, 1969, Terry Melcher visited Spahn Ranch to hear Manson and the women sing. Melcher arranged a subsequent visit, not long thereafter, on which he brought a friend who possessed a mobile recording unit; but he himself did not record the group.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|156,185}}<ref>Sanders 2002, 133<U+2013>36.</ref>

By June, Manson was telling the Family they might have to show blacks how to start "Helter Skelter".<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|244<U+2013>247}}<ref name="watson12">[http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-012.php Watson, Ch. 12].</ref><ref name="watkins15">Watkins, Ch. 15</ref> When Manson tasked Watson with obtaining money supposedly intended to help the Family prepare for the conflict, Watson defrauded a black [[drug dealer]] named Bernard "Lotsapoppa" Crowe. Crowe responded with a threat to wipe out everyone at Spahn Ranch. Manson countered on July 1, 1969, by shooting Crowe at his [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] apartment.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|99<U+2013>113}}<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|91<U+2013>96}}<ref name="watson13">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-013.php |title=Watson, Ch. 13 |publisher=Aboundinglove.org |date=August 8, 1969 |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>Sanders 2002, 147<U+2013>49.</ref>

Manson's mistaken belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] in Los Angeles. Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson, concluding he had been, expected retaliation from the group. He turned Spahn Ranch into a defensive camp, with night patrols of armed guards.<ref name="watson13" /><ref>Sanders 2002, 151.</ref> "If we'd needed any more proof that Helter Skelter was coming down very soon, this was it," Tex Watson would later write, "[B]lackie was trying to get at the chosen ones."<ref name="watson13" />

===Hinman murder===
On July 25, 1969, Manson sent sometime Family member [[Bobby Beausoleil]] along with [[Mary Brunner]] and [[Susan Atkins]] to the house of acquaintance Gary Hinman, to persuade him to turn over money Manson thought Hinman had inherited.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|75<U+2013>77}}<ref name="watson13" /><ref name="atkins">Atkins, Susan, with Bob Slosser. ''Child of Satan, Child of God''; Logos International, Plainfield, New Jersey; 1977; ISBN 0-88270-276-9; pages 94<U+2013>120.</ref> The three held the uncooperative Hinman hostage for two days, during which Manson showed up with a sword to slash his ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, ostensibly on Manson<U+2019>s instruction. Before leaving the Topanga Canyon residence, Beausoleil, or one of the women, used Hinman<U+2019>s blood to write "Political piggy"<!--"Piggy," not "Piggie"; photo is in Bugliosi 1994, between pages 142 and 143--> on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|33, 91<U+2013>96, 99<U+2013>113}}<ref>Sanders 2002, page 184.</ref>

In magazine interviews of 1981 and 1998<U+2013>99,<ref name="oui">[http://www.charliemanson.com/beausoleil.htm Beausoleil ''Oui'' interview]. Charlie Manson.com.</ref><ref name="seconds">[http://www.beausoleil.net/mminterview.html Beausoleil ''Seconds'' interviews]. beausoleil.net.</ref> Beausoleil would say he went to Hinman<U+2019>s to recover money paid to Hinman for drugs that had supposedly been bad; he added that Brunner and Atkins, unaware of his intent, went along idly, merely to visit Hinman. On the other hand, Atkins, in her 1977 autobiography, wrote that Manson directly told Beausoleil, Brunner, and her to go to Hinman<U+2019>s and get the supposed inheritance<U+2014>$21,000. She said Manson had told her privately, two days earlier, that, if she wanted to "do something important," she could kill Hinman and get his money.<ref name="atkins" />

===Tate murders===
Beausoleil was arrested on August 6, 1969, after he had been caught driving Hinman's car. Police found the murder weapon in the tire well.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}} Two days later, Manson told Family members at Spahn Ranch, "Now is the time for Helter Skelter."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="watson13" /><ref>[http://www.2violent.com/closing_argument4.html Prosecution's closing argument] Page 6 of multi-page transcript, 2violent.com.</ref>

On the night of August 8, Manson directed Watson to take Atkins, [[Linda Kasabian]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] to "that house where Melcher used to live" and "totally destroy everyone in [it], as gruesome as you can."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|463<U+2013>468}}<ref name="watson14">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-014.php |title=Watson, Ch. 14 |publisher=Aboundinglove.org |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> He told the women to do as Watson would instruct them.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 258<U+2013>269}} Krenwinkel was one of the early Family members, one of the hitchhikers who had allegedly been picked up by Dennis Wilson.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|250<U+2013>253}}  The current occupants of the house, all of whom were strangers to the Manson followers, were movie actress [[Sharon Tate]], wife of famed director [[Roman Polanski]] and eight and a half months [[pregnant]]; her friend and former lover [[Jay Sebring]], a noted hairstylist; Polanski's friend and aspiring screenwriter [[Wojciech Frykowski]], and Frykowski<U+2019>s lover [[Abigail Folger]], heiress to the [[Folgers Coffee|Folger coffee fortune]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}}  Tate's husband, Polanski, was in London working on a film project; Tate had been visiting with him and had returned to the United States only three weeks earlier. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

When the murder team arrived at the entrance to the [[10050 Cielo Drive|Cielo Drive]] property, Watson, who had been to the house on at least one other occasion, climbed a telephone pole near the gate and cut the phone line.<ref name="watson9"/>  It was now around midnight and into August 9, 1969. Backing their car down to the bottom of the hill that led up to the place, the group parked there and walked back up to the house. Thinking the gate might be electrified or rigged with an alarm,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184}} they climbed a brushy embankment at its right and dropped onto the grounds. Just then, headlights came their way from farther within the angled property. Watson ordered the women to lie in the bushes. He then stepped out and ordered the approaching driver, 18-year-old student and hi-fi enthusiast [[Steven Parent]], to halt. As Watson leveled a 22-caliber revolver at Parent, the frightened youth begged Watson not to hurt him, claiming that he wouldn't say anything. Watson first slashed at Parent with a knife, giving him a defensive slash wound on the palm of his hand (severing tendons and tearing the boy's watch off his wrist), then shot him four times in the chest and abdomen. Watson then ordered the women to help push the car further up the driveway<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|22<U+2013>25}}<ref name="watson14" /> After traversing the front lawn and having Kasabian search for an open window of the main house, Watson cut the screen of a window. Watson told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate; she walked over to Steven Parent's Rambler and waited.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184}}<ref name="watson14" /> He then removed the screen, entered through the window, and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184}}

As Watson whispered to Atkins, Frykowski awoke on the living-room couch; Watson kicked him in the head.<ref name="watson14" /> When Frykowski asked him who he was and what he was doing there, Watson replied, "I<U+2019>m [[the devil]], and I<U+2019>m here to do the devil<U+2019>s business."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184}}<ref name="watson14" />

On Watson<U+2019>s direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants and, with Krenwinkel's help,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 297<U+2013>300}} brought them to the living room. Watson began to tie Tate and Sebring together by their necks with rope he'd brought and slung up over a beam. Sebring's protest <U+2014> his second <U+2014> of rough treatment of the pregnant Tate prompted Watson to shoot him. Folger was taken momentarily back to her bedroom for her purse, out of which she gave the intruders $70. After that, Watson stabbed the groaning Sebring seven times.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}}<ref name="watson14" />

Frykowski's hands had been bound with a towel. Freeing himself, Frykowski began struggling with Atkins, who stabbed at his legs with the knife with which she had been guarding him.<ref name="watson14" /> As he fought his way toward and out the front door, onto the porch, Watson joined in against him. Watson struck him over the head with the gun multiple times, stabbed him repeatedly, and shot him twice.<ref name="watson14" /> Watson broke the gun's right grip in the process.

Around this time, Kasabian was drawn up from the driveway by "horrifying sounds."  She arrived outside the door. In a vain effort to halt the massacre, she told Atkins falsely that someone was coming.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="watson14" />

Inside the house, Folger had escaped from Krenwinkel and fled out a bedroom door to the pool area.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|341<U+2013>344, 356<U+2013>361}} Folger was pursued to the front lawn by Krenwinkel, who stabbed{{ndash}}and finally, tackled{{ndash}}her. She was dispatched by Watson; her two assailants had stabbed her 28 times.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}}<ref name="watson14" /> As Frykowski struggled across the lawn, Watson murdered him with a final flurry of stabbing. Frykowski was stabbed a total of 51 times.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38, 258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="watson14" />

Back in the house, Tate pleaded to be allowed to live long enough to have her baby, and even offered herself as a hostage in an attempt to save the life of her unborn child; her killers would have none of it, as either Atkins, Watson, or both killed Tate, who was stabbed 16 times.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}} Watson later wrote that Tate cried, "Mother... mother..." as she was being killed.<ref name="watson14" />

Earlier, as the four Family members had headed out from Spahn Ranch, Manson had told the women to "leave a sign... something witchy".<ref name="watson14" /> Using the towel that had bound Frykowski<U+2019>s hands, Atkins wrote "pig" on the house<U+2019>s front door, in Tate's blood. En route home, the killers changed out of bloody clothes, which were ditched in the hills, along with their weapons.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|84<U+2013>90, 176<U+2013>184}}<ref name="watson14" />

In initial confessions to cellmates of hers at [[Sybil Brand Institute]], Atkins would say she killed Tate.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|84<U+2013>90}} In later statements to her attorney, to prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]], and before a [[grand jury]], Atkins indicated Tate had been stabbed by Tex Watson.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|163<U+2013>174, 176<U+2013>184}} In his 1978 autobiography, Watson said that he stabbed Tate and that Atkins never touched her.<ref name="watson14" /> Since he was aware that the prosecutor, Bugliosi, and the jury that had tried the other Tate-LaBianca defendants were convinced Atkins had stabbed Tate, he falsely testified that he did not stab her.<ref name="watson19">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-007.php |title=Watson, Ch. 19 |publisher=Aboundinglove.org |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref>

===LaBianca murders===
The next night, six Family members<U+2014>[[Leslie Van Houten]], [[Steve "Clem" Grogan]], and the four from the previous night<U+2014>rode out at Manson<U+2019>s instruction. Displeased by the panic of the victims at Cielo Drive, Manson accompanied the six, "to show [them] how to do it."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="watson15">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-015.php |title=Watson, Ch. 15 |publisher=Aboundinglove.org |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> After a few hours<U+2019> ride, in which he considered a number of murders and even attempted one of them,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="watson15" /> Manson gave Kasabian directions that brought the group to 3301 Waverly Drive. This was the home of supermarket executive [[Leno LaBianca]] and his wife, [[Rosemary LaBianca|Rosemary]], a dress shop co-owner.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|22<U+2013>25, 42<U+2013>48}} Located in the [[Los Feliz]] section of Los Angeles, it was next door to a house at which Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 204<U+2013>210}}

According to Atkins and Kasabian, Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say he had tied up the house's occupants; then he sent Watson up with Krenwinkel and Van Houten.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 258<U+2013>269}} In his autobiography, on the other hand, Watson stated that, having gone up alone, Manson returned to take him up to the house with him. After Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window, the two of them entered through the unlocked back door.<ref name="watson15" /> Watson added that, at trial, he "went along with" the women's account, which he figured made him "look that much less responsible."<ref name="watson19" />

As Watson tells it, Manson roused the sleeping [[Leno LaBianca]] from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong. After [[Rosemary LaBianca]] was brought briefly into the living room from the bedroom, Watson followed Manson<U+2019>s instructions to cover the couple<U+2019>s heads with pillowcases. He bound these in place with lamp cords. Manson left, sending Krenwinkel and [[Leslie Van Houten]] into the house with instructions that the couple be killed.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="watson15" />

Before leaving Spahn Ranch, Watson had complained to Manson of the inadequacy of the previous night's weapons.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|258<U+2013>269}} Now, sending the women from the kitchen to the bedroom, to which Rosemary LaBianca had been returned, he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome-plated [[bayonet]]. The first thrust went into the man's throat.<ref name="watson15" />

Sounds of a scuffle in the bedroom drew Watson there to discover Mrs. LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck. After subduing her with several stabs of the bayonet, he returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno, whom he stabbed a total of 12 times with the bayonet. When he had finished, Watson carved "WAR" on the man's exposed abdomen. He stated this in his autobiography.<ref name="watson15" /> In an unclear portion of her eventual [[grand jury]] testimony, Atkins, who did not enter the LaBianca house, possibly said she believed Krenwinkel had carved the word.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184}}<ref>{{cite|title=Atkinson grand jury testimony |work= Afternoon grand-jury testimony of Susan Atkins, Los Angeles, California, December&nbsp;5, 1969}} The statement comes in a moment of confusion on the part of Atkins; it's possible she's saying she believes Krenwinkel is the person who ''told her'' about the carving of "War."</ref>  In a [[ghostwriter|ghost-written]] newspaper account based on a statement she had made earlier to her attorney,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|160,193}} she said Watson carved it.<ref>Susan Atkins<U+2019> Story of 2 Nights of Murder ''Los Angeles Times'', Sunday, December 14, 1969.</ref>

Returning to the bedroom, Watson found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary LaBianca with a knife from the LaBianca kitchen. Heeding Manson<U+2019>s instruction to make sure each of the women played a part, Watson told Van Houten to stab Mrs. LaBianca too.<ref name="watson15" /> She did, stabbing her approximately 16 times in the back and the exposed buttocks.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|204<U+2013>210, 297<U+2013>300, 341<U+2013>344}} At trial, Van Houten would claim, uncertainly,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|433}} that Rosemary LaBianca was dead when she stabbed her. Evidence showed that many of Mrs. LaBianca's 41 stab wounds had, in fact, been inflicted post-mortem.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|44, 206, 297, 341<U+2013>42, 380, 404, 406<U+2013>07, 433}}

While Watson cleaned off the bayonet and showered, Krenwinkel wrote "Rise" and "Death to pigs" on the walls and "Healter [sic] Skelter" on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca blood. She gave Leno LaBianca 14 puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which she left jutting out of his stomach. She also planted a steak knife in his throat.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 258<U+2013>269}}<ref name="watson15" />

Hoping for a double crime, Manson had gone on to direct Kasabian to drive to the [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice]] home of an actor acquaintance of hers, another "piggy." Depositing the second trio of Family members at the man's apartment building, he drove back to Spahn Ranch, leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 258<U+2013>269}} Kasabian thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger. As the group abandoned the murder plan and left, [[Susan Atkins]] defecated in the stairwell.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|270<U+2013>273}}

===Investigation===
The Tate murders had become news on August 9, 1969. The Polanskis<U+2019> housekeeper, Winifred Chapman, had arrived for work that morning and discovered the murder scene.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|5<U+2013>6, 11<U+2013>15}} On August 10, detectives of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case, informed [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house.

Steven Parent, the shooting victim in the Tate driveway, was determined to have been an acquaintance of William Garretson, who lived in the guest house. Garretson was a young man hired by Rudi Altobelli to take care of the property while Altobelli himself was away.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}} As the killers arrived, Parent had been leaving Cielo Drive, after a visit to Garretson.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38}}

Held briefly as a Tate [[suspect]], Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night. He was released on August 11, 1969, after undergoing a [[polygraph]] examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|28<U+2013>38, 42<U+2013>48}}  Interviewed decades later, he stated he had, in fact, witnessed a portion of the murders, as the examination suggested.

Fifteen-year-old Frank Struthers<U+2014>Rosemary's son from a prior marriage and Leno's stepson<U+2014>returned from a camping trip and was disturbed by the exterior condition of the home.

Still working separately from the Tate team, the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff<U+2019>s office in mid-October, about possible similar crimes. They learned of the Hinman case.

====Apprehension====
On December 1, 1969, acting on the information from these sources, LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian in the Tate case; the suspects' involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted. Manson and Atkins, already in custody, were not mentioned; the connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten, who was also among those arrested near Death Valley, had not yet been recognized.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|125<U+2013>127, 155<U+2013>161, 176<U+2013>184}}

Watson and Krenwinkel, too, were already under arrest, authorities in [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], Texas, and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama, having picked them up on notice from LAPD.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|155<U+2013>161}}  Informed that there was a warrant out for her arrest, Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], on December 2.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|155<U+2013>161}}

Before long, physical evidence such as Krenwinkel's and Watson's [[fingerprint]]s, which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|15, 156, 273, and photographs between 340<U+2013>41}} was augmented by evidence recovered by the public. On September 1, 1969, the distinctive .22-caliber Hi Standard "Buntline Special" revolver Watson used on [[Steven Parent|Parent]], [[Jay Sebring|Sebring]], and [[Wojciech Frykowski|Frykowski]] had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss, a 10-year-old who lived near the Tate residence.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|66}} In mid-December, when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|160,193}} Weiss' father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|198<U+2013>199}} Acting on that same newspaper account, a local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|197<U+2013>198}} The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered, despite a search by some of the same crewmen and, months later still, by LAPD.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|198, 273}}  A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins, who lost her knife in the course of the attack.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|17, 180, 262}}<ref>Atkins 1977, 141.</ref>

===Trial===
The trial began June 15, 1970.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|297<U+2013>300}} The prosecution's main witness was Kasabian, who, along with Manson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|185<U+2013>188}} Not having participated in the killings, she was granted [[prosecutorial immunity|immunity]] in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|214<U+2013>219, 250<U+2013>253, 330<U+2013>332}} Originally, a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the [[indictments]] were secured; once Atkins repudiated that testimony, the deal was withdrawn.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|169, 173<U+2013>184, 188, 292}} Because Van Houten had only participated in the LaBianca killings, she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy.

Originally, Judge William Keene had reluctantly granted Manson permission to [[pro se|act as his own attorney]]. Because of Manson's conduct, including violations of a [[gag order]] and submission of "outlandish" and "nonsensical" [[motion (legal)|pretrial motions]], the permission was withdrawn before the trial's start.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|200<U+2013>202, 265}} Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene, who was replaced by Judge [[Charles H. Older]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|290}} On Friday, July 24, the first day of testimony, Manson appeared in court with an X carved into his forehead. He issued a statement that he was "considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend [him]self" <U+2014> and had "X'd [him]self from [the establishment's] world."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|310}}<ref>Sanders 2002, 388.</ref> Over the following weekend, the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads, as did most Family members within another day or so.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|316}} (Manson's X was eventually replaced by a [[swastika]]. See "[[Charles Manson#Remaining in view|Remaining in view]]", below.)

The prosecution placed the triggering of "Helter Skelter" as the main motive.<ref>[http://www.2violent.com/closing_argument27.html Prosecution's closing argument] Page 29 of multi-page transcript, 2violent.com.</ref> The crime scene's bloody ''[[White Album]]'' references<U+2014>''pig'', ''rise'', ''helter skelter''<U+2014>were correlated with testimony about Manson predictions that the murders blacks would commit at the outset of Helter Skelter would involve the writing of "pigs" on walls in victims<U+2019> blood.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|244<U+2013>247, 450<U+2013>457}} Testimony that Manson had said "now is the time for Helter Skelter" was supplemented with Kasabian<U+2019>s testimony that, on the night of the LaBianca murders, Manson considered discarding Rosemary LaBianca's wallet on the street of a black neighborhood.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|258<U+2013>269}} Having obtained the wallet in the LaBianca house, he "wanted a black person to pick it up and use the credit cards so that the people, [[the establishment]], would think it was some sort of an organized group that killed these people."<ref name="wallet">[http://www.2violent.com/closing_argument20.html Prosecution's closing argument] Pages 22<U+2013>23 of multi-page transcript, 2violent.com.</ref> On his direction, Kasabian had hidden it in the women's rest room of a service station near a black area.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|176<U+2013>184, 190<U+2013>191, 258<U+2013>269, 369<U+2013>377}} "I want to show blackie how to do it," Manson had said as the Family members had driven along after the departure from the LaBianca house.<ref name="wallet" />

====Ongoing disruptions====
During the trial, Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse. To keep them out of the courtroom itself, the prosecution [[subpoena]]ed them as prospective witnesses, who would not be able to enter while others were testifying.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|309}} When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk, each of the "hard-core" members wore a sheathed hunting knife that, being in plain view, was carried legally. Each of them was also identifiable by the X on his or her forehead.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|339}}

Some Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying. Prosecution witnesses [[Paul Watkins (Manson Family)|Paul Watkins]] and Juan Flynn were both threatened;<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|280, 332<U+2013>335}} Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|280}} Former Family member Barbara Hoyt, who had overheard [[Susan Atkins]] describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse, agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii. There, Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of [[LSD]]. Found sprawled on a [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] curb in a drugged semi-stupor, Hoyt was taken to the hospital, where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate-LaBianca murder trial. Before the incident, Hoyt had been a reluctant witness; after the attempt to silence her, her reticence disappeared.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|348<U+2013>350, 361}}

On August 4, despite precautions taken by the court, Manson flashed the jury a ''Los Angeles Times'' front page whose headline was "Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares." This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] had decried what he saw as the media's glamorization of Manson. [[Voir dire]]d by Judge [[Charles Older|Older]], the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them. The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon's remark, there was no point in going on with the trial.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|323<U+2013>238}}

On October 5, Manson was denied the court's permission to question a prosecution witness whom the defense attorneys had declined to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]]. Leaping over the defense table, Manson attempted to attack the judge. Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs, he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants, who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in [[Latin]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|369<U+2013>377}} Thereafter, Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|369<U+2013>377}}

====Defense rests====
On November 16, the prosecution rested its case. Three days later, after arguing standard dismissal motions, the defense stunned the court by resting as well, without calling a single witness. Shouting their disapproval, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten demanded their right to testify.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|382<U+2013>388}}

In chambers, the women's lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|382<U+2013>388}}  By resting their case, the defense lawyers had tried to stop this; Van Houten's attorney, [[Ronald Hughes]], vehemently stated that he would not "push a client out the window." In the prosecutor's view, it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|382<U+2013>388}} Speaking about the trial in a 1987 documentary, Krenwinkel said, "The entire proceedings were scripted <U+2014> by Charlie."<ref>''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' <U+2014> "Charles Manson."  [[A&E Network]].</ref>

The next day, Manson testified. Lest he violate the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''People v. Aranda'' by making statements implicating his co-defendants, the jury was removed from the courtroom.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|134}} Speaking for more than an hour, Manson said, among other things, that "the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment." He said, "Why blame it on me? I didn<U+2019>t write the music." "To be honest with you," Manson also stated, "I don<U+2019>t recall ever saying 'Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says.'&nbsp;"<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|388<U+2013>392}}

As the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending, attorney Ronald Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|393<U+2013>398}} When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes' absence, a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|393<U+2013>398}} No sooner had the trial resumed, just before Christmas, than disruptions of the prosecution's closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the [[bifurcation (law)|guilt phase]]. Older said it had become obvious the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|399<U+2013>407}}

====Conviction and penalty phase====
On January 25, 1971, guilty verdicts were returned against the four defendants on each of the 27 separate counts against them.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|411<U+2013>419}} Not far into the trial's [[bifurcation (law)|penalty phase]], the jurors saw, at last, the defense that Manson<U+2014>in the prosecution's view<U+2014>had planned to present.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|455}}  Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as "copycat" versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil, by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil<U+2014>[[Linda Kasabian]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|424<U+2013>433}} Among the narrative's weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written "political piggy" at the Hinman house in the first place.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|424<U+2013>433, 450<U+2013>457}}

Midway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, "I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|439}} In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state's request for the [[capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|439, 455}}

The effort to exonerate Manson via the "copycat" scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|450<U+2013>457}} On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|458<U+2013>459}}

On the day the verdicts recommending the death penalty were returned, news came that the badly decomposed body of Ronald Hughes had been found wedged between two boulders in [[Ventura County]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|457}} It was rumored, although never proven, that Hughes was murdered by the Family, possibly because he had stood up to Manson and refused to allow Van Houten to take the stand and absolve Manson of the crimes.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|387, 394, 481}} Though he might have perished in flooding,<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|393<U+2013>394, 481}}<ref>Sanders 2002, 436<U+2013>38.</ref> Family member [[Sandra Good]] stated that Hughes was "the first of the retaliation murders."<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|481<U+2013>482, 625}}

The trial commenced in August 1971; by October, he, too, had been found guilty on seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Unlike the others, Watson had presented a psychiatric defense; prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi made short work of Watson's insanity claims. Like his co-conspirators, Watson was sentenced to death.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|463<U+2013>468}}

In February 1972, the death sentences of all five parties were automatically reduced to life in prison by ''[[California v. Anderson]]'', 493 P.2d 880, 6 Cal. 3d 628 ([[Supreme Court of California|Cal.]] 1972), in which the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty in that state.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|488<U+2013>491}} After his return to prison, Manson's rhetoric and hippie speeches were not accepted.{{Who|date=August 2010}} Though he eventually found temporary acceptance from the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], his role was submissive to a sexually aggressive member of the group, at [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Edward |last=George |coauthor=Dary Matera |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5t7eXdmx8c8C |title=Taming the Beast: Charles Manson's Life Behind Bars |publisher=Macmillan |year=1999 |pages=42<U+2013>45 |isbn=9780312209704}}</ref>

In a 1971 trial that took place after his Tate/LaBianca convictions, Manson was found guilty of the murders of Gary Hinman and [[Donald "Shorty" Shea]] and was given a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]]. Shea was a Spahn Ranch stuntman and horse wrangler who had been killed approximately 10 days after the August 16, 1969, sheriff's raid on the ranch. Manson, who suspected that Shea helped set up the raid, had apparently believed Shea was trying to get Spahn to run the Family off the ranch. Manson may have considered it a "sin" that the white Shea had married a black woman; and there was the possibility that Shea knew about the Tate/LaBianca killings.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|99<U+2013>113}}<ref>Sanders 2002, 271<U+2013>2.</ref> In separate trials, Family members Bruce Davis and Steve "Clem" Grogan were also found guilty of Shea's murder.<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|99<U+2013>113, 463<U+2013>468}}<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansonparole.html Transcript of Charles Manson's 1992 parole hearing] University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.

Before the conclusion of Manson's Tate/LaBianca trial, a reporter for the ''Los Angeles Times'' tracked down Manson's mother, remarried and living in the [[Pacific Northwest]].

On September 5, 1975, the Family rocketed back to national attention when [[Lynette Fromme|Squeaky Fromme]] attempted to assassinate US President [[Gerald Ford]].<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|502<U+2013>511}} The attempt took place in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], to which she and Manson follower [[Sandra Good]] had moved to be near Manson while he was incarcerated at [[Folsom State Prison]]. A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme, Good, and a Family recruit turned up evidence that, coupled with later actions on the part of Good, resulted in Good's conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail and transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce. (The threats that were involved were against corporate executives and US government officials and had to do with supposed environmental dereliction on their part.)<ref name="bugliosi" />{{Rp|502<U+2013>511}} Fromme was sentenced to 15 years to life, becoming the first person sentenced under [[United States Code]] Title 18, chapter 84 (1965),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001751----000-.html |title=18 U.S.C. <U+00A7> 1751 |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> which made it a Federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States.

In 1977, authorities learned the precise location of the remains of Shorty Shea and that, contrary to Family claims, Shea had not been dismembered and buried in several places. Contacting the prosecutor in his case, Steve Grogan told him Shea<U+2019>s corpse had been buried in one piece; he drew a map that pinpointed the location of the body, which was recovered.

In the 1980s, Manson gave three notable interviews. The first, recorded at [[California Medical Facility]] and aired June 13, 1981, was by [[Tom Snyder]] for [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]''.

On September 25, 1984, while imprisoned at the [[California Medical Facility]] at [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]], Manson was severely burned by a fellow inmate who poured paint thinner on him and set him alight.

In December 1987, Fromme, serving a life sentence for the assassination attempt, escaped briefly from [[Alderson Federal Prison Camp]] in [[West Virginia]].

In January 1996, a Manson web site was established by latter-day Manson follower George Stimson, who was helped by [[Sandra Good]].

In a 1981 interview with ''Oui'' magazine, he denied this. Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, "I wasn't even sure at that point <U+2014> really, I had no idea who had done it until Manson's group were actually arrested for it. It had only crossed my mind and I had a premonition, perhaps. There was some little tickle in my mind that the killings might be connected with them...." In the ''Oui'' magazine interview, he had stated, "When [the Tate-LaBianca murders] happened, I knew who had done it. I was fairly certain."<ref name="oui"/>

William Garretson, once the young caretaker at [[10050 Cielo Drive|Cielo Drive]], indicated in a program broadcast in July 1999 on ''[[E!]]'', that he had, in fact, seen and heard a portion of the Tate murders from his location in the property<U+2019>s guest house. This comported with the unofficial results of the [[polygraph]] examination that had been given to Garretson on August 10, 1969, and that had effectively eliminated him as a suspect.<ref>[http://www.charliemanson.com/documents/garretson-polygraph.htm Transcript of William Garretson polygraph exam.] CharlieManson.com.

As the 40th anniversary of the Tate-LaBianca murders approached, in July 2009, [[Los Angeles (magazine)|''Los Angeles'' magazine]] published an "oral history", in which former Family members, law-enforcement officers, and others involved with Manson, the arrests, and the trials offered their recollections of<U+2014>and observations on<U+2014>the events that made Manson notorious. In the article, Juan Flynn, a Spahn Ranch worker who had become associated with Manson and the Family, said:

In November 2009, a Los Angeles DJ and songwriter named {{visible anchor|Matthew Roberts}} released correspondence and other evidence indicating he had been biologically fathered by Manson. Roberts' biological mother claims to have been a member of the Manson Family who left in the summer of 1967 after being raped by Manson; the mother returned to her parents' home to complete the pregnancy, gave birth on March 22, 1968, and subsequently gave up Roberts for adoption.

In 2010, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in 2009, and had contacted people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia. A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if Manson had used the phone for criminal purposes.<ref>[http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/weird/Cell-Phone-Charles-Manson-Busted-with-a-Mobile-111256244.html?dr "Cell" Phone: Charles Manson Busted with a Mobile]</ref>
