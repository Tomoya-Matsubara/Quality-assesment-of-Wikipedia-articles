'''Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M<U+00E9>xico''', (better known as '''N de M''') was [[Mexico]]'s state owned [[railroad]] company from 1938 to 1998, and prior to 1938 (dating from the regime of [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]]) a major railroad controlled by the government that linked [[Mexico City]] to the major cities of [[Nuevo Laredo]] and [[Ciudad Ju<U+00E1>rez]] on the [[US-Mexico border|U.S. border]]. The first trains to Nuevo Laredo from Mexico City began operating in 1903.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rtminsk/queretarotracks1.html| work=Quer<U+00E9>taro, Qro.: a chronology of railroad development| title=Part 1: 1870-1907| author=Minsk, R. Todd| date=July 2003| accessdate=March 7, 2009}}</ref>

N de M absorbed the Mexican Central Railroad (''[[Ferrocarril Central Mexicano]]'', first section from Mexico City to [[Le<U+00F3>n, Guanajuato]], opened in 1882) in 1909, thus acquiring a second border gateway at Ciudad Ju<U+00E1>rez (adjacent to [[El Paso, Texas]]). The N de M was [[nationalize]]d by [[President of Mexico|President]] [[L<U+00E1>zaro C<U+00E1>rdenas del R<U+00ED>o]] in 1938, and [[privatize]]d 60 years later by President [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. N de M operated most railway trackage through the central and northeastern regions of the republic.

During the days of [[steam locomotives]], N de M was best known for operating ''[[4-8-4|Ni<U+00E1>gara]]'' class locomotives, which took their name from the [[New York Central Railroad]] locomotives of the same wheel configuration. N de M was one of the few railroads outside the US to purchase new diesel locomotives from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]- the only three " Baldwin E-units" ever built ("0660 1000/2 DE"), the [[DR-12-8-1500/2|Centipede]] and the AS-616.  Two of the three 0660 1000/2 DE locomotives had been on major railroads in the United States on a demonstration tour in 1945.  N de M bought them and ordered a third in 1946.  All three consistently broke down and were retired soon after their factory warranties expired.  They do not appear on the 1950 N de M locomotive roster, and sat for years in the scrapyard at San Luis Potos<U+00ED>.  Notes in the FNM archives in Puebla, Mexico describe how one of these locomotives had a wheel disintegrate at high speed, and also how the Centipede locomotives were delivered in 1948 with parts missing.

In [[Ac<U+00E1>mbaro]], [[Guanajuato]], N de M operated one of the few facilities in Latin America that was capable of constructing and doing complete rebuilds of steam locomotives, thus with rare exceptions (as with the ''Niagaras''), most of N de M steam motive power was purchased used and rebuilt there. Portions of the facility and a preserved [[2-8-0]] steam locomotive remain as part of Acambaro's municipal railway museum. 

In 1995, the Mexican government announced that the FNM would be privatized and divided into four main systems, see [[Rail transport in Mexico#Privatization|Rail transport in Mexico: Privatization]]. As part of the restructuring for privatization, FNM suspended passenger rail service in 1997, and the new arrangements applied from 1998. The companies were [[Kansas City Southern de Mexico]], [[Ferromex]], [[Ferrosur]], and (owned jointly by the three companies) [[Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de M<U+00E9>xico]] or Ferrovalle which operates railroads and terminals in and around Mexico City. 

As of 2006, the remaining parts of NdeM are in the process of liquidation.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fnm.com.mx| title=Ferrocariles Nacionales de M<U+00E9>xico en Liquidaci<U+00F3>n| author=Ferrocariles Nacionales de M<U+00E9>xico| date=September 10, 2008| accessdate=March 7, 2009}}</ref>

==Notable named passenger trains of the N de M ==

Named trains usually bore names related to the destination, for example, ''El [[Pur<U+00E9>pecha people|Pur<U+00E9>pecha]]'' referred to the Purepecha (Tarascan) peoples of western [[Michoac<U+00E1>n]].

*''<U+00C1>guila Azteca'' - [[Mexico City]] - [[Monterrey]] - [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas|Nuevo Laredo]]
*''El Regiomontano'' - [[Mexico City]] - [[Monterrey]] - [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas|Nuevo Laredo]]
*''El Fronterizo'' - [[Ciudad Ju<U+00E1>rez]] - [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] - [[Mexico City]]
*''El Oaxaque<U+00F1>o'' - [[Mexico City]] - [[Puebla (city)|Puebla]] - [[Oaxaca (city)|Oaxaca]]
*''El Pur<U+00E9>pecha'' - [[Mexico City]] - [[Morelia]] - [[Uruapan]] ([[Michoac<U+00E1>n]])
*''El Tapat<U+00ED>o'' - [[Mexico City]] - [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]]
*''El R<U+00E1>pido de la Frontera'' ([[Diesel multiple unit|railcar service]]) [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] - [[Ciudad Ju<U+00E1>rez]]
*''El Hidalguense'' - [[Mexico City]] - [[Pachuca, Hidalgo]].

Other passenger service was provided between Mexico City and: [[Cuernavaca, Morelos]]; [[Tampico, Tamaulipas]]; [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato]]; and  [[Veracruz, Veracruz]].

Buenavista station in Mexico City has been renovated and is now the southern end of the new electric [[Tren Suburbano]] line.  Photos of Buenavista often prominently feature a pyramid-like tower, the [[Torre Insignia]]. The building housed the headquarters of [[Banobras]], but currently is unoccupied and it has been renovated. A preserved Niagara steam locomotive and GE boxcab can be viewed at the Museum of Electricity at Chapultepec, Mexico City.  Many more preserved Mexican steam, diesel and electric locomotives can be viewed at the FNM museum in Puebla, Mexico.
