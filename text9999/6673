'''Cape Town''' ([[Afrikaans]]: ''Kaapstad'' {{IPA|/<U+02C8>k<U+0251><U+02D0>pst<U+0251>t/}}; [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]: ''iKapa'') is the [[List of largest cities in South Africa by population|third most populous city]] in [[South Africa]], forming part of the [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]] of the [[City of Cape Town]]. It is the provincial [[capital]] of the [[Western Cape]], as well as the [[legislature|legislative]] capital of South Africa, where the [[Parliament of South Africa|National Parliament]] and many government offices are located. Cape Town is famous for its harbour as well as its natural setting in the [[Cape floral kingdom]], including such well-known landmarks as [[Table Mountain]] and [[Cape Point]]. Often regarded as one of the world's most beautiful cities because of its geography, Cape Town is the most popular South African destination for [[tourism]] ({{cite web|url=http://www.cpprop.com/news_cape_town_newlands_claremont_simonstown_constantia_bishopscourt_cape_town_villas_hout_bay_kommetjie_camps_bay_llandudno.html|Publisher=Cape Private Properties|title=Cape Town in 60 seconds}})

Cape Town was originally developed as a victualling station for [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ships sailing to [[Eastern Africa]], [[India]], and the [[Far East]] more than 200 years before the construction of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869. [[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s arrival on [[6 April]] [[1652]] established the first permanent European settlement in [[South Africa]]. Cape Town quickly outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the [[Castle of Good Hope]]. It was the largest city in South Africa until the growth of [[Johannesburg]] and [[Durban]].

According to the [[South African National Census of 2001|2001 Census]], the city has a population of 2.95&nbsp;million.<ref name='mdb-ctmp2006'>{{cite web|url=http://www.demarcation.org.za/info_Index.aspx?type=Metropolitan&code=Cape%20Town&Prov=Western%20Cape&sT=Metropolitan&frm=home|publisher=Municipal Demarcation Board|title=Cape Town Municipal Profile 2006}}</ref> Cape Town's land area of 2,499&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (965&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]) is larger than other South African cities, resulting in a comparatively lower population density of 1,158 people per square kilometre (2,999/sq&nbsp;mi).<ref name='mdb-ctmp2006'/> Cape Town is [[town twinning|town twinned]] with [[Nice]] in [[France]] and [[Haifa]] in [[Israel]].

==History==
{{main|History of Cape Town}}

There is no certainty as to when humans first occupied the area prior to the first visits of Europeans in the 15th century. The earliest known remnants in the region were found at Peers cave in [[Fish Hoek]] and date to around 12,000 years ago. Little is known of the history of the region's first residents, since there is no written history from the area before it was first mentioned by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486. [[Vasco da Gama]] recorded a sighting of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1497, and the area did not have regular contact with Europeans until 1652, when the [[Netherlands]]' [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and other employees of the [[Dutch East India Company]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie'', VOC) were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The city grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the city to import slaves from [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]]; many of whom would come to form the first of the [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] communities.

<!-- The Cape remained under Dutch control until the 1780s, when the Netherlands entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] alongside the [[Early Modern France|French]] rulers against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. As a result of the Dutch entering the war, the British invaded the Netherlands in 1795.{{citation needed}} By this time, the VOC had lost almost all of its influence in Cape Town and was almost completely [[bankrupt]]. When the Netherlands fell to the British{{citation needed}}, British soldiers were moved to the Cape in a [[garrison]] to prevent a French invasion. -->
The British successfully gained outright control of Cape Town in 1795, during the [[Battle of Muizenberg]]. Under the terms of a [[peace agreement]] negotiated after the war, the Cape was returned to the Dutch in 1803. The war resumed later that year, and British forces re-occupied the Cape, after winning the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]] in 1806. In the 1814 peace treaty which ended the war in Europe, the Cape was permanently incorporated into the [[British Empire]]. As the territory under British control grew even larger outward from the city, it became the capital of the newly formed [[Cape Colony]].
[[Image:JanVanRiebeckArrival.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A painting of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] in [[Table Bay]] (by [[Charles Davidson Bell|Charles Bell]])]]

The discovery of [[diamond]]s in [[Griqualand West]] in 1869, and [[gold]] on the [[Witwatersrand]] in 1886, near the present-day city of [[Johannesburg]] prompted a massive [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|gold rush]]. Johannesburg grew rapidly as the country was flooded with immigrants. Tensions also emerged between the [[Boer]]s, who had taken part in the [[Great Trek]] and established republics in the centre of the country; the new migrants, known as [[uitlander]]s; and the British colonial government. This conflict resulted in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]]. After the British won this war and acquired control of the gold and diamond industries, they unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics (the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]]) and the British [[colony of Natal]] to form the [[Union of South Africa]], which was proclaimed in 1910 with Cape Town as its legislative capital, a function it has continued to serve for the [[Republic of South Africa]] from 1961 to the present.

In 1948, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] was elected on election promises of [[racial segregation]] laws, collectively known by the [[Afrikaans]] word ''[[apartheid]]''. As a consequence of the [[Group Areas Act]], which classified all areas of the country and city according to race, formerly multi-racial suburbs were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town is [[District Six, Cape Town|District Six]], which was demolished in 1965, prompting the forced removal of over 60,000 residents after it was declared a whites-only region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|title=Recalling District Six|date=[[19 August]] [[2003]]}}</ref> Many of these residents were relocated to the [[Cape Flats]]. Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a "[[Coloured]] labour preference area", to the exclusion of [[Black African]]s.

[[Image:Luthuli - Tutu - de Klerk - Mandela.jpg|thumb|250px|Nobel Square at the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront.]]
Cape Town was home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement, despite many of the group's leaders' internment on [[Robben Island]], a penitentiary island 10 kilometres out to sea from the city, where many famous political prisoners were held for many years. In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, [[Nelson Mandela]] made his first public speech in decades on [[11 February]] [[1990]] from the balcony of [[Cape Town City Hall]] hours after being released. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country, and the first [[South African general election, 1994|democratic election]] was held four years later, on [[27 April]] [[1994]]. Since 1994, the city has struggled with problems such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and a surge in violent [[Drug-related crime|drug-related crime]].<!--, which has given the city one of the highest [[homicide]] rates in the world.{{citation needed}}--> At the same time, the economy has surged to unprecedented levels due to the boom in the [[tourism]] and the [[real estate]] industries.

==Geography==
[[Image:Satellite image of Cape peninsula.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[NASA]] [[satellite]] image of Cape Town and its environment taken by a [[Landsat]] satellite in February 2000]]
[[Image:Lion's Head and Signal Hill.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Lion's Head and Signal Hill From Table Mountain]]
The centre of Cape Town is located at the northern end of the [[Cape Peninsula]]. [[Table Mountain]] forms a dramatic backdrop to the city bowl, with its plateau over 1,000m (3,300&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) high; it is  surrounded by near-vertical cliffs, [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]]. Sometimes a thin strip of cloud forms over the mountain, and owing to its appearance, it is affectionately known as the "tablecloth". The peninsula consists of a dramatic mountainous spine jutting southwards into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], ending at [[Cape Point]]. There are over 70 peaks above 1,000&nbsp;feet (304.8&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) (the American definition of a [[mountain]]) within Cape Town's official city limits. Many of the suburbs of Cape Town are on the large plain of the [[Cape Flats]], which joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Flats lie on what is known as a rising marine plain, consisting mostly of sandy geology which shows that at one point Table Mountain itself was an island.

=== Climate ===
The [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape Peninsula]] has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with well-defined [[season]]s. In [[winter]], which lasts from May to September, large [[cold front]]s come across from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and strong north-westerly winds. The winter months are cool, with an average minimum temperature of 7<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (45<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]). Most of the city's annual rainfall occurs in wintertime, but due to the mountainous topography of the city, rainfall amounts for specific areas can vary dramatically. The suburb of Newlands which is to the south of the city is the wettest place in South Africa. The valleys and coastal plains average 515&nbsp;[[millimetre]]s (20&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]) of rain per annum, while mountain areas can average as much as 1,500&nbsp;millimetres (60&nbsp;in) per annum. Summer, which lasts from November to March, is warm and dry. The Peninsula gets frequent strong winds from the south-east, known locally as the [[Cape Doctor]], because it blows away pollution and cleans the air. The south-easterly wind is caused by a [[Pressure system#High-pressure system|high-pressure system]] which sits in the [[South Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] to the west of Cape Town, known as the South-Atlantic High. Summer temperatures are mild, with an average maximum of 26<U+00B0>C (79<U+00B0>F).<ref name='saws-ctcd'>{{cite web|url=http://www.weathersa.co.za/Climat/Climstats/CapeTownStats.jsp|publisher=[[South African Weather Service]]|title=Cape Town Climate Data}}</ref>

==Government==
[[Image:CapeTownCityHall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Cape Town City Hall]], located in the [[City Bowl, Cape Town|City Bowl]]]]
{{main|City of Cape Town}}

Cape Town's local government is the [[City of Cape Town]], which is a [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]]. Cape Town is governed by a 210-member [[city council]], which reports to a 28-member executive council. The executive council, in turn, is presided over by a city manager and an executive mayor. The city is divided into 105 electoral wards; each ward directly elects one member of the council, whilst the other 105 councillors are elected by a [[party-list proportional representation]] system. The [[mayor]] is chosen by the city council.

The current mayor is [[Helen Zille]] of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]. In the most recent [[South African municipal election, 2006|local government election]]s, the Democratic Alliance was the largest single party with 90 of the 210 seats on the council, ahead of the [[African National Congress]]'s 81 seats, but with no party holding a majority. A subsequent by-election has increased the DA's seats to 91.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.za/lgeresults/Static%20Report/95/Seats%20by%20Municipality%20LCMC/CPT-1.pdf|publisher=Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa|title=City of Cape Town, 2006 Local Government Elections: Seat Calculation Summary|date=[[3 April]] [[2006]]}}</ref> The DA has now increased it's majority, by introducing the [[Independent Democrats (South Africa)]] to the coalition, and so the DA-led council now has a majority of 22 seats. 

Before the unification of Cape Town's local government into the so-called "Unicity", it was divided into six regional "Administrations"; many functions of the Unicity are still divided according to the old Administrations. The administrations include ''Cape Town'', which has the regions of the [[City Bowl]], the Atlantic Seaboard, the southern suburbs, [[Pinelands, Cape Town|Pinelands]], [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]] and [[Mitchell's Plain]]. ''The South Peninsula'' includes [[Hout Bay]], [[Wynberg, Cape Town|Wynberg]], [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]], [[Fish Hoek]], [[Kommetjie, Cape Town|Kommetjie]], [[Noordhoek]] and [[Simon's Town]]. The ''Blaauwberg region'' includes [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Tableview, Cape Town|Tableview]], and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]]. ''[[Tygerberg, Cape Town|Tygerberg]]'' has its own region, with [[Durbanville, Cape Town|Durbanville]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], and [[Khayelitsha]] added to it. ''Oostenberg'' includes [[Kraaifontein, Cape Town|Kraaifontein]], [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]], [[Kuilsrivier, Cape Town|Kuilsrivier]], [[Blue Downs, Cape Town|Blue Downs]], and [[Eerste Rivier, Cape Town|Eerste Rivier]]. The last administration, ''Helderberg'', includes [[Somerset West, Western Cape|Somerset West]], [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]], and [[Gordon's Bay]].

== Economy ==
[[Image:Cape Town International Convention Centre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The main entrance to the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]]]]
Cape Town is the economic centre of the Western Cape and serves as the regional manufacturing centre. It also has the primary harbour and airport in the Western Cape. The large government presence in the city, both as the capital of the Western Cape and the seat of the [[Parliament of South Africa|National Parliament]], has led to increased revenue and growth in industries that serve the government. Cape Town hosts many [[meeting|conferences]], particularly in the new [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]], which opened in June 2003. The city has recently enjoyed a booming real estate and [[construction]] market, with many people buying summer homes in the city as well as relocating there permanently. The central business district is under an extensive urban renewal programme, with numerous new buildings and renovations taking place under the guidance of the [[Cape Town Partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/econrep.asp|title=City of Cape Town: Economic Statistics}}</ref>

Cape Town has four major commercial nodes, with Cape Town Central Business District containing the majority of job opportunities and office space. [[Century City (Cape Town)|Century City]], the [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville]]/TygerValley strip and [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]] commercial nodes are well established and contain many offices and corporate headquarters as well. 

High school attendance rates and the city's well-established higher education infrastructure have helped Cape Town to attract foreign investors, as there are more people with internationally recognised certification and diplomas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspa.asn.au/Confs/icp2005/sahlberg.ppt|title=Education Reform and Economic Competitiveness|publisher=International Convention of Principals (ICP 2005)}}</ref>

The Western Cape also generates a quarter of the South African agricultural sector's total gross income and more than half of South Africa's exports. Much of the produce is handled through the [[Port of Cape Town]] or [[Cape Town International Airport]]. Most major ship-building companies have offices and manufacturing locations in Cape Town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafricanboatbuilders.co.za|title=South African Boatbuilders Business Council}}</ref> The Province is also a centre of energy development for the country, with the existing [[Koeberg nuclear power station]] providing energy for the majority of Cape Town's needs. Recently, scientists have discovered [[crude oil|oil]] and [[natural gas]] off of the coast in the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dme.gov.za|title=South African Department of Minerals and Energy}}</ref>

The Western Cape is an important tourist region in South Africa; the tourism industry accounts for 9.8% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the province and employs 9.6% of the province's workforce. In 2004, over 1.5 million international tourists visited the area.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.capegateway.gov.za/Text/2005/12/dmo_annualreport_20042005.pdf|publisher=Cape Town Routes Unlimited|title=Annual Report 2004/2005|id=ISBN 0-621-35496-1|format=PDF}}</ref>

Cape Town is arguably the most popular tourist destination in South Africa due to its good climate, natural setting, and relatively well-developed infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismcapetown.co.za/|title=Official Western Cape and Cape Town tourism guide}} </ref> The city has several well-known natural features that attract tourists, most notably [[Table Mountain]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tablemountain.net/|title=Table Mountain Aerial Cableway}}</ref> which forms a large part of the [[Table Mountain National Park]] and is the back end of the [[City Bowl, Cape Town|City Bowl]]. Reaching the top of the mountain can be achieved either by hiking up, or by taking the [[Table Mountain Cableway]]. [[Cape Point]] is recognised as the dramatic headland at the end of the [[Cape Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capepoint.co.za/|title=Cape Point, South Africa}}</ref> Many tourists also drive along [[Chapman's Peak|Chapman's Peak Drive]], a narrow road that links [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]] with [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]], for the views of the Atlantic Ocean and nearby mountains. It is possible to either drive or hike up [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]] for closer views of the City Bowl and Table Mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.ac.za/frames/kirstfram.htm|title=Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden}}</ref>

Many tourists also visit [[List of beaches of Cape Town|Cape Town's beaches]], which are popular with local residents. Due to the city's unique geography, it is possible to visit several different beaches in the same day, each with a different setting and atmosphere. Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have very cold water as the water is mostly [[glacier|glacial melt]] from [[Antarctica]]. The water at [[False Bay]] beaches is often warmer by up to 10 <U+00B0>C (18 <U+00B0>F).<ref name='CTbeaches'>{{cite web|url=http://www.safarinow.com/cms/cape-town-beaches/irie.aspx|title=Cape Town Beaches|publisher=SafariNow.com}}</ref> Both coasts are equally popular, although the beaches in affluent [[Clifton, Cape Town|Clifton]] and elsewhere on the Atlantic Coast are better developed with restaurants and caf<U+00E9>s, with a particularly vibrant strip of restaurants and bars accessible to the beach at [[Camps Bay]].<ref name='CTbeaches'/> [[Boulders Beach]] near Simon's Town is known for its colony of [[African Penguin|African penguin]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simonstown.com/tourism/penguins/penguins.htm|title=The African Penguin}}</ref> [[Surfing]] is popular and the city hosts the [[Red Bull Big Wave Africa]] surfing competition every year.

The city has several notable cultural attractions. The [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]], built on top of part of the [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s of the [[Port of Cape Town]], is one of the city's most popular shopping venues, with several hundred shops and the [[Two Oceans Aquarium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfront.co.za/|title=The Victoria & Alfred Waterfront}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquarium.co.za/|title=The Two Oceans Aquarium}}</ref> Part of the charm of the V&A, as it is locally known, is that the Port continues to operate and visitors can watch ships enter and leave. The V&A also hosts the Nelson Mandela Gateway, through which [[ferry|ferries]] depart for [[Robben Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robben-island.org.za|title=Robben Island}}</ref> It is possible to take a ferry from the V&A to [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]], [[Simon's Town, Cape Town|Simon's Town]] and the [[Cape Fur Seal]] colonies on Seal and Duiker Islands. Several companies offer tours of the [[Cape Flats]], a mostly Coloured [[Township (South Africa)|township]], and [[Khayelitsha]], a mostly black township. An option is to sleep overnight in Cape Town's townships. There are several B&Bs where you can spend a safe and real African night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/todonight/Western-Cape/Townships/Township-BaBs-Discover-what-true-African-hospitality-is-all-about~11|title=Township stays}}</ref>

Cape Town is noted for its architectural heritage, with the highest density of [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch]] style buildings in the world. Cape Dutch style, which combines the architectural traditions of the Netherlands, Germany and France, is most visible in [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]], the old government buildings in the Central Business District, and along [[Long Street (Cape Town)|Long Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encounter.co.za/article/19.html|title=Cape Dutch Architecture|publisher=Encounter South Africa}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A Comparative Evaluation of Urbanism in Cape Town|publisher=University of Cape Town Press|date=1977|pages=20<U+2013>98|id=ISBN 0-620-02535-2}}</ref> The annual [[Coon Carnival|Cape Town Minstrel Carnival]], also known by its [[Afrikaans]] name of ''Kaapse Klopse'', is a large [[minstrel]] festival held annually on [[January 2]] or "Tweede Nuwe Jaar" (Afrikaans: Second New Year). Competing teams of minstrels parade in brightly coloured costumes, either carrying colourful umbrellas or playing an array of musical instruments. The [[Artscape Theatre Centre]] is the main performing arts venue in Cape Town.

Night life in the city caters for all tastes and sexual preferences, with a range of restaurants and cafes that are generally recognised as including some of the finest eateries in South Africa (both in food quality and decor terms). Night clubs and bars abound with popular areas including the top end of Long Street and its immediate surrounds, as well as the redeveloped Cape Malay quarter, [[De Waterkant]]. Varied accommodation for tourists is also abundant, ranging from well located backpackers hostels to hotels that have been rated at the top of their class in world terms.

Cape Town's transport system links it to the rest of South Africa; it serves as the gateway to other destinations within the province. The [[Cape Winelands]] and in particular the towns of [[Stellenbosch, Western Cape|Stellenbosch]], [[Paarl, Western Cape|Paarl]] and [[Franschhoek, Western Cape|Franschhoek]] are popular day trips from the city for sightseeing and [[wine tasting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismcapewinelands.co.za/|title=Cape Winelands}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winelands.co.za|title=The Western Cape wine lands}}</ref> [[Whale watching]] is popular amongst tourists: [[Southern Right Whale]]s are seen off the coast during the breeding season (August to November) and [[Bryde's Whale]]s can be seen any time of the year.<ref name='CTwhale'>{{cite web|url=http://www.afton.co.za/whale-watching.htm|title=Cape Town Whale Watching|publisher=Afton Grove}}</ref> The nearby town of [[Hermanus]] is known for its Whale Festival, but whales can also be seen in False Bay.<ref name='CTwhale'/> [[Heaviside's Dolphin|Heaviside's dolphin]]s are endemic to the area and can be seen from the coast north of Cape Town; [[Dusky Dolphin|dusky dolphin]]s live along the same coast and can occasionally be seen from the ferry to Robben Island.<ref name='CTwhale'/>

Approximately 1.5 million tourists visited in Cape Town during 2004, bringing in a total of R10 billion in revenue.  The forecasts for 2006 anticipate 1.6 million tourists spending a total of R12 billion.

Cape Town's most popular sports by participation are [[cricket]], [[football (soccer)|association football]], [[swimming]], and [[rugby union|rugby]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Time Out: Cape Town|publisher=Time Out Publishing|date=2006|pages=127&ndash;130: Sports|id=ISBN 1-904978-12-6}}</ref> The [[Stormers]] represent [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province]] and [[Boland]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]'s [[Super 14]] [[rugby union]] competition. Cape Town is the home of the [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province Rugby Union]], who play at [[Newlands Stadium]] and compete in the [[Currie Cup]]. Cape Town also regularly hosts the national team, the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]], and hosted matches during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], including a semi-final.

Football, which is better known as ''soccer'' in South Africa, is also popular. Two [[Football club|clubs]] from Cape Town play in the [[Premier Soccer League]] (PSL), South Africa's premier league. These teams are [[Ajax Cape Town]], which formed as a result of the 1999 amalgamation of the [[Seven Stars (Cape Town)|Seven Stars]] and the [[Cape Town Spurs]]; and [[Santos Football Club (South Africa)|Santos]]. Cape Town will also be the location of several of the matches of the [[Football World Cup 2010|FIFA 2010 World Cup]], which is to be held in South Africa. The Mother City is building a new 70,000 seat stadium in the Green Point area.

In cricket, the [[Cape Cobras]] represent Cape Town at the [[Newlands Cricket Ground]]. The team is the result of an amalgamation of the [[Western Province Cricket]] and [[Boland Cricket]] teams. They take part in the [[Supersport Series|Supersport]] and [[Standard Bank Cup Series]].

Cape Town has Olympic aspirations: in 1996, Cape Town was one of the five candidate cities shortlisted by the [[IOC]] to launch official candidatures to host the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although the games ultimately went to [[Athens]], Cape Town came in an impressive third place, edging out [[Stockholm]] and [[Buenos Aires]] in the first three rounds of voting. There has been some speculation that Cape Town is seeking the South African Olympic Committee's nomination to be South Africa's bid city for either the [[2016 Summer Olympic Games|2016]] or the [[2020 Summer Olympic Games]].

;Air
[[Cape Town International Airport]] serves both domestic and international flights. It is the second-largest airport in South Africa and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Cape region. Cape Town has direct flights to most cities in South Africa as well as a number of international destinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/plan_trip/travel_tips/arriving/ctairport.htm|title=Cape Town International Airport|publisher=SouthAfrica.info}}</ref>

As of June 2006, Cape Town International Airport is being upgraded to handle an expected increase in air traffic as tourism numbers will increase in the lead-up to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.co.za/1998/05/17/news/cape/nct01.htm|publisher=Sunday Times|title=R150-million upgrade kicks off one of the biggest developments in Cape Town's history|date=[[17 May]] [[1998]]|first=Bobby|last=Jordan}}</ref> The renovations include several large new parking garages, a revamped domestic departure terminal and a new international terminal. The airport's cargo facilities are also being expanded and several large empty lots are being developed into [[office|office space]] and hotels.

The Cape Town International Airport was among the winners of the [[World Travel Awards]] for being  Africa's leading airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctru.co.za/C3/CapeTownInternationalAirportamongtheWorld.pdf|title=Cape Town International Airport|publisher=Cape Town Routes Unlimited}}</ref>

;Sea
Cape Town has a long tradition as a port city. The [[Port of Cape Town]], the city's main port, is located in [[Table Bay]] directly to the north of the central business district. The port is a hub for ships in the southern Atlantic: it is located along one of the busiest shipping corridors in the world. It is also a busy container port, second in South Africa only to [[Durban]]. In 2004, it handled 3,161 ships and 9.2 million tonnes of [[cargo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ports.co.za/port-operations.php|publisher=South African Port Operations|title=Introducing SAPO}}</ref>

[[Simon's Town, Cape Town|Simon's Town Harbour]] on the [[False Bay]] coast of the [[Cape Peninsula]] is the main base of the [[South African Navy]].

;Rail
The ''[[Shosholoza Meyl]]'' is the passenger rail operations of [[Spoornet]] and operates two long-distance passenger rail services from Cape Town: a daily service to and from [[Johannesburg]] via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] and a weekly service to and from [[Durban]] via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]], [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Pietermaritzburg]]. These trains terminate at [[Cape Town Railway Station]] and make a brief stop at [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]]. Cape Town is also one terminus of the luxury tourist-oriented [[Blue Train (South Africa)|Blue Train]].

[[Metrorail (Western Cape)|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Cape Town and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.

;Road
Three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] start in Cape Town: the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] which links Cape Town with [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Zimbabwe]]; the [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] which links Cape Town with [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]; and the [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] which links Cape Town with the [[Northern Cape Province]] and [[Namibia]]. The N1 and N2 both start in the Central Business District, and split to the east of the CBD, with the N1 continuing to the north east and the N2 heading south east past [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The N7 starts in [[Mitchells Plain]] and runs north, intersecting with the N1 and the N2 before leaving the city.

Cape Town also has a system of [[freeway]] and [[dual carriageway]] M-roads, which connect different parts of the city. The [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of [[Table Mountain]], connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. The [[R300 (Western Cape)|R300]], which is informally known as the ''Cape Flats Freeway'', links [[Mitchells Plain]] with [[Bellville, South Africa|Bellville]], the N1 and the N2.

;Buses
[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services throughout the Cape Town metropolitan area. Several companies run long-distance bus services from Cape Town to the other cities in South Africa.

;Taxis
Cape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.

Minibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8|publisher=CapeTown.org|title=Transport}}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy. These taxis make frequent unscheduled stops to pick up passengers, which can cause accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1566/is_200209/ai_n7215423|title=South Africa's minibus wars: uncontrollable law-defying minibuses oust buses and trains from transit|publisher=LookSmart}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewclimate.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/transportation_in_south_africa/trans_sa_execsumm.cfm|title=Transportation in Developing Countries: Greenhouse Gas Scenarios for South Africa|publisher=Pew Center}}</ref> With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often filled over their legal passenger allowance, making for high casualty rates when minibuses are involved in accidents. Minibuses are generally owned and operated in fleets, and inter-operator violence flares up from time to time, especially as [[Taxi wars in South Africa|turf war]]s occur over lucrative taxi routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aworldconnected.org/article.php/1341.html|title=Taxing Alternatives: Poverty Alleviation and the South African Taxi/Minibus Industry|publisher=Enterprise Africa! Research Publications}}</ref>

==Universities==
[[Image:UCT Upper Campus landscape view.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[University of Cape Town]]'s main campus with [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] behind it]]
Cape Town has a well-developed [[higher education]] system of [[public university|public universities]]. Cape Town is served by three public universities: the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT), the [[University of the Western Cape]] (UWC) and the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]] (CPUT). [[Stellenbosch University]], while not in the city itself, is 50 kilometres from the City Bowl and has additional campuses, such as the Tygerberg Faculty of Health Sciences and the Bellville Business Park closer to the City.

Both the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University are leading universities in South Africa. This is due in large part to substantial financial contributions made to these institutions by both the public and private sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/pdf/compete.zip|title=Competitiveness factors|publisher=City of Cape Town}}</ref> Since the [[African National Congress]] has come into governmental power, some restructuring of Western Cape universities has taken place and as such, traditionally non-white universities have seen increased financing, which has benefitted the University of the Western Cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.at/heritage/society/index.htm|title=Cape Town Society|publisher=CapeConnected}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/01/20/PAGE7.HTM|title=Education Cosas critical of education funding|publisher=Dispatch Online}}</ref>

The public Cape Peninsula University of Technology was formed on [[January 1]], [[2005]], when two separate institutions <U+2013> [[Cape Technikon]] and [[Peninsula Technikon]] <U+2013> were merged. The new university offers education primarily in [[English language|English]], although one may take courses in any of South Africa's official languages. The institution generally awards the [[National Diploma (South Africa)|National Diploma]].
