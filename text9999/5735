'''''Hadropithecus''''' is a medium-sized, [[extinct]] genus of [[lemur]], or [[strepsirrhine]] [[primate]], from [[Madagascar]] that includes a single species, '''''Hadropithecus stenognathus'''''. Due to its rarity and lack of sufficient skeletal remains, it is one of the least understood of the extinct lemurs. Both it and ''[[Archaeolemur]]'' are collectively known as "[[monkey lemur]]s" or "baboon lemurs" due to [[body plan]]s and [[dentition]] that suggest a [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] lifestyle and a diet similar to that of modern [[baboon]]s. ''Hadropithecus'' had extended molars and a short, powerful jaw, suggesting that it was both a [[Grazing|grazer]] and a [[Seed predation|seed predator]].

The monkey lemurs are considered to be most closely related to the living [[indri]]ids and the recently extinct [[sloth lemur]]s, although recent finds had caused some dispute over a possible closer relation to living [[Lemuridae|lemurid]]s. Genetic tests, however, have reaffirmed the previously presumed relationship. ''Hadropithecus'' lived in open habitat in the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Plateau]], South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. It is known only from [[subfossil]] or recent remains and is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It died out around 444<U+2013>772 [[Common Era|CE]], shortly after the arrival of humans on the island.

==Etymology==
The common names that ''Hadropithecus'' shares with ''Archaeolemur'', "[[monkey lemur]]s" and "baboon lemurs", come from their dental and locomotor adaptations, which resemble that of modern African [[baboon]]s.<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd">{{LoM2 | pages = 37<U+2013>51}}</ref><ref name="Sussman4">{{cite book | last = Sussman | first = R.W. | title= Primate Ecology and Social Structure | chapter = Chapter 4: The Nocturnal Lemuriformes | pages = 107<U+2013>148 | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-536-74363-3}}</ref> The genus ''Hadropithecus'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words <U+03B1><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''hadros'', meaning "stout" or "large", and <U+03C0><U+03AF><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''pithekos'', meaning "ape".

==Classification and phylogeny==
''Hadropithecus stenognathus'' is classified as the sole member of the genus ''Hadropithecus'' and belongs to the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Archaeolemuridae]]. This family in turn belongs to the infraorder [[Lemuriformes]], which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.<ref name="Nowak" /> The species was formally described in 1899 from a [[mandible]] (lower jaw) found at [[Andrahomana]] cave in southeastern Madagascar by [[paleontologist]] Ludwig Lorenz von Liburnau, who thought it represented an [[ape]].<ref name="1899Lorenz_von_Liburnau">{{cite journal|last1=Lorenz von Liburnau|first1=L.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xkQUAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3AHARVARD32044093282572&pg=PA255#v=onepage&q=Hadropithecus&f=false|title=Herr Custor Dr. Ludwig v.

In a publication from 1902, he declared that ''Hadrophithecus stenognathus'' was not an ape, but a lemur.<ref name="1902Lorenz_von_Liburnau"/> Over 100 years later, the rarity of its skeletal remains has made this species one of the least understood species of [[subfossil lemur]].<ref name="2008Ryan"/>

Based on similarities in their skull and teeth, it was later thought that monkey lemurs (''Hadropithecus'' and ''Archaeolemur'') were a sister group to the living [[indri]]ids and the recently extinct [[sloth lemur]]s (family Palaeopropithecidae).<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd">{{LoM1 | pages = 33<U+2013>48}}</ref><ref name="NaturalChange6">{{cite book | editor1-last = Goodman | editor1-first = S.M. | editor2-last = Patterson | editor2-first = B.D | last1 = Simons | first1 = E.L. | chapter = Chapter 6: Lemurs: Old and New | title = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar | pages = 142<U+2013>166 | publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-1-56098-682-9}}</ref> However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were more closely related to today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of ''[[Babakotia]]'' and ''[[Mesopropithecus]]'', two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth.<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" /> More recently, [[postcrania]]l remains of ''Hadropithecus'' found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the [[Lemuridae|lemurid]]s.<ref name="2006Godfrey">{{cite journal | last1 = Godfrey | first1 = L.R. | last2 = Jungers | first2 = W.L. | last3 = Burney | first3 = D.A. | last4 = Vasey | first4 = N. | last5 = Ramilisonina | first5 = S.J. | last6 = Wheeler | first6 = W. | last7 = Lemelin | first7 = P. | last8 = Shapiro | first8 = L.J. | last9 = Schwartz | first9 = G.T. | title = New discoveries of skeletal elements of ''Hadropithecus stenognathus'' from Andrahomana Cave, southeastern Madagascar | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | year = 2006 | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pmid = 16911817 | pages = 395<U+2013>410 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.04.012}}</ref> However, [[DNA sequencing]] has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.<ref name="2008Orlando" />

''Hadropithecus stenognathus'' has been estimated to have weighed between {{convert|27|and|35|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and to have been roughly as large as ''Archaeolemur'', although more gracile.<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /> Newer subfossil finds, however, suggest that ''Hadropithecus'' may have been more robust, and more like a [[gorilla]] than a baboon.<ref name="Lemurs3" /> It may also have been less agile than [[Old World monkey]]s.<ref name="2008Ryan"/> Both lemurs were [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] (walked on four legs).<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /> There is no evidence of [[cursorial]]ity (adaptations specifically for running) in either species,<ref name="Lemurs3">{{cite book | editor1-last = Gould | editor1-first = L. | editor2-last = Sauther | editor2-first = M.L | last1 = Godfrey | first1 = L.R. | last2 = Jungers | first2 = W.L. | last3 = Schwartz | first3 = G.T. | chapter = Chapter 3: Ecology and Extinction of Madagascar's Subfossil Lemurs | title = Lemurs: Ecology and Adaptation | pages = 41<U+2013>64 | publisher = Springer | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-387-34585-7}}</ref> and although ''Hadropithecus'' could have climbed trees, it lacked adaptations for leaping or [[Suspensory behavior|suspension]].<ref name="2008Ryan"/>

Although fewer postcranial remains have been discovered for ''Hadropithecus'' than for ''Archaeolemur'', what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] or semi-terrestrial lifestyle,<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /><ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="NaturalChange6" /> an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build.<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" /> Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, ''Hadropithecus'' is thought to have been the more terrestrial of the two,<ref name="NaturalChange6" /> since ''Archaeolemur'' may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees.<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /> Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />

<!-- Note to Visionholder: Return to Walker's Mammals of the World, page 247 in Natural Change, and Ryan 2008 for more details on dentition -->
The face of ''Hadropithecus'' was shortened and adapted to heavy stress from chewing. The monkey lemurs had highly specialized teeth, but ''Hadropithecus'' went further by specializing in strong grinding.<ref name="NaturalChange8">{{cite book | editor1-last = Goodman | editor1-first = S.M. | editor2-last = Patterson | editor2-first = B.D. | last1 = Godfrey | first1 = L.R. | last2 = Jungers | first2 = W.L. | last3 = Reed | first3 = K.E. | last4 = Simons | first4 = E.L. | last5 = Chatrath | first5 = P.S. | chapter = Chapter 8: Subfossil Lemurs | title = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar | pages = 218<U+2013>256 | publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-1-56098-682-9}}</ref> It had expanded [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s that wore down quickly,<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" /> much like those of [[ungulate]]s,<ref name="Nowak" /> and its posterior [[premolars]] acted like molars to extend the grinding surface.<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" /> It also had a robust [[mandible]] to facilitate crushing hard objects.<ref name="NaturalChange8" /> Even the strepsirrhine [[toothcomb]] was reduced in this species.<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" /> Its [[dental formula]] was {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=1.1.3.3|total=34}}<ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" />

The skulls of both ''Hadropithecus'' and ''Archaeolemur'' indicate that monkey lemurs had relatively large brains compared to the other subfossil lemurs, with ''Hadropithecus'' having an estimated [[Endocranium|endocranial]] volume of 115&nbsp;ml.<ref name="2008Ryan"/>

==Ecology==
Like all other lemurs, ''Hadropithecus'' was [[Endemism|endemic]] to Madagascar. Because it died out only recently and is only known from subfossil remains, it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur.<ref name="Sussman4" /> It once ranged across the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar.<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Sussman4" /> Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its [[ecological niche]], and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]] and [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] (or [[CAM photosynthesis|CAM]]) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet.<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /><ref name="Lemurs3" /> Its physiology and [[dentition]] suggest that it may have been much like the [[Gelada|Gelada Baboon]] in locomotion and diet,<ref name="Nowak" /><ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="Mittermeier_1stEd" /> acting as a [[Grazing|manual grazer]] (picking grass with the hands) since its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds.<ref name="Sussman4" /><ref name="NaturalChange6" /> Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a [[Seed predation|seed predator]].<ref name="Lemurs3" /><ref name="NaturalChange8" /> More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between Gelada Baboons and ''Hadropithecus'', indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a grazer, but strictly a hard object processor.<ref name="2008Ryan"/>

==Extinction==
Because of the low number of subfossil finds, ''Hadropithecus'' is thought to have been rare,<ref name="NaturalChange6" /> and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, ''Archaeolemur''.<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" /> Both disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, ''Hadropithecus'' would have faced more pressure from domestic [[livestock]], introduced [[pigs]], and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin.<ref name="Nowak" /> The last known record was [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to around 444<U+2013>772 [[Common Era|CE]].<ref name="Mittermeier_2ndEd" />
