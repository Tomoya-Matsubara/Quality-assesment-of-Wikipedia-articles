'''Ha<U+021B>eg Island''' was a large offshore [[island]] in the [[Tethys Sea]] which existed during the late [[Cretaceous]] period, probably from the [[Cenomanian]] to the [[Maastrichtian]] ages.<ref name=bentonetal2010/> It was situated in an area corresponding to the region around modern-day [[Ha<U+021B>eg]], [[Hunedoara County]], [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Csikia, Z., and M.

It was formed mainly by [[tectonic uplift]] during the early [[Alpine orogeny]], caused by the [[Adriatic Plate]]'s northwest movement across the [[Piemont-Liguria Ocean]]{{Verify source|date=July 2007}} towards the end of the Cretaceous. There is no real present-day analog, but overall, the island of [[Hainan]] (off the coast of [[China]]) is perhaps closest as regards [[climate]], [[geology]] and [[topography]], though still not a particularly good match. The [[vegetation]], for example, was of course entirely distinct from today, as was the [[fauna]].

The Hungarian paleontologist [[Franz Nopcsa]] theorized that "limited resources" found on the island commonly have an effect of "reducing the size of animals" over the generations, producing a localized form of dwarfism. Nopcsa's theory of [[insular dwarfism]] <U+2014> also known as the [[island rule]] <U+2014> is today widely accepted.

==Geography==
While a variety of estimates regarding the prehistoric island's size have been given over the years, the most reliable estimate places it at roughly 80,000 square kilometers during the Maastrichtian, or about the size of the modern island of [[Hispaniola]]. It was positioned just within the equatorial belt, at about 27<U+00B0>N latitude.<ref name=bentonetal2010>Benton, M.J., Csiki, Z., Grigorescu, D., Redelstorff, R., Sander, P.M., Stein, K., and Weishampel, D.B. (2010).

Hateg Island was probably located at least {{convert|200|km|mi}} from the nearest land mass. To the northwest was an island corresponding to the [[Bohemian Massif]], to the southeast was an island corresponding to the Balkan<U+2013>Rhodope Massif (including the modern [[Rhodope Mountains]] region), and to the west was a large island corresponding to part of the modern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] land mass. The closest continental land mass were portions of the Austro-Alpine region to the west and the [[Adriatic]] region to the south.<ref name=bentonetal2010/>

Hateg Island itself was surrounded primarily by a deep marine basin, unlike some of the surrounding islands and land masses which were surrounded by shallow seas.<ref name=bentonetal2010/>

==Climate and ecology==
During the Maastrichtian, the climate of Hateg Island was sub-tropical, with an average temperature of 20-25 degrees Celsius.<ref name=bentonetal2010/> The island experience marked rainy and dry seasons, but despite this the plant life on the island was mainly tropical in nature. Carbon isotopes indicate "dry woodland" conditions. This seeming contradiction between the seasonally dry climate and tropical plant species can be explained by the fact that tropical plants can thrive in a seasonally [[monsoon]]al environment today as long as they have access to sufficient amounts of water year-round, and the Hateg environment seems to have been dominated by braided rivers and lakes. Early rock layers are dominated by volcanic deposits, but these are absent in higher layers, indicating that volcanic activity dropped off during this time.<ref name=bentonetal2010/>

==Paleofauna==
[[File:Azhdarchid map.png|thumb|Map showing pterosaurs of Ha<U+021B>eg island, with location]] 
About nine species of dinosaurs, and one species of pterosaur are thought to have been indigenous to the island. Most of these animals were smaller versions of mainland megafauna, which became smaller due to island dwarfism, although this is certainly not the case for ''Hatzegopteryx'' which, being one of the biggest pterosaurs ever, is an example of [[island gigantism]]. Among them are included:
*''[[Theriosuchus sympiestodon]]'', an [[atoposauridae|atoposaurid]]
*''[[Hatzegopteryx thambema]]'', a [[pterosaur]]
*''[[Rhabdodon priscus]]'', an [[ornithopod]]
*''[[Zalmoxes robustus]]'', an ornithopod
*''[[Telmatosaurus transylvanicus]]'', a [[hadrosaur]]
*''[[Struthiosaurus transylvanicus]]'', a [[nodosaur]]
*''[[Magyarosaurus dacus]]'', a [[titanosaur]]
*''[[Paludititan nalatzensis]]'', a titanosaur
*''[[Elopteryx nopcsai]]'', a [[theropod]]
*''[[Megalosaurus hungaricus]]'', an indeterminate theropod
*''[[Balaur bondoc]]'', a [[velociraptorinae|velociraptorine]] dromaeosaur
*''[[Bradycneme draculae]]'', a theropod
*''[[Eurazhdarcho langendorfensis]]'', a pterosaur
