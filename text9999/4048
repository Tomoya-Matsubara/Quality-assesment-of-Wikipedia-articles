The '''Falkirk Wheel''' is a rotating [[boat lift]] in Scotland, connecting the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] with the [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]]. Named after the nearby town of [[Falkirk]] in central Scotland, the lift opened in 2002, reconnecting the two canals for the first time since the 1930s as part of the [[Millennium Link]] project.

The plan to regenerate [[Central Belt|central Scotland]]'s canals and reconnect [[Glasgow]] with [[Edinburgh]] was led by [[British Waterways]] with support and funding from seven local authorities, the [[Scottish Enterprise]] Network, the [[European Regional Development Fund]], and the [[Millennium Commission]]. Planners decided early on to create a dramatic 21st-century landmark structure to reconnect the canals, instead of simply recreating the historic [[lock flight]].

The wheel raises boats by {{convert|24|m}}, but the Union Canal is still {{convert|11|m}} higher than the aqueduct which meets the wheel, and boats must pass through a pair of [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] to get between the top of the wheel and the Union Canal. The Falkirk Wheel is the only rotating boat lift of its kind in the world, and one of two boat lifts in the United Kingdom, the other being the [[Anderton boat lift]].

The two canals served by the wheel were previously connected by a series of 11 [[canal lock|locks]].<ref name=swthist>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishwaterwaystrust.org.uk/scotland's-canals/the-falkirk-wheel/history-of-the-falkirk-wheel |title=History of The Falkirk Wheel |publisher=Scottish Waterways Trust |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=fwhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk/about-the-wheel-/history |title=History |publisher=The Falkirk Wheel |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref> With a {{convert|35|m}} difference in height, it required {{convert|3500|t}} of water per run and took most of a day to pass through the flight.<ref name=ed>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/~swelch/Site_visits/FalkirkWheel.pdf |title=The Millenium Link |publisher=University of Edinburgh |accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref>

By the 1930s these had fallen into disuse, and the locks were dismantled in 1933.<ref name=swthist /><ref name=fwhist /> The Forth and Clyde canal closed at the end of 1962,<ref name=p1875>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1875}}</ref> and the by the mid-1970s the Union canal was filled in both ends, rendered impassable by [[culvert]]s in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate.<ref name=p1877>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1877}}</ref> The [[British Waterways Board]] (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the Forth and Clyde was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.<ref name=p1875/><ref name=p1877/>

In 1976, the BWB decided after a meeting with local councils that the Forth and Clyde canal, fragmented by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks.<ref name=p1880>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1880}}</ref> Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but there were to be no further restrictions on its use.<ref name=p1880/> A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.<ref name=p1880/>

===Proposal===
{{wide image|Falkirk Wheel panorama.jpg|500px|Panoramic view of the wheel and aqueduct.|alt=Panoramic view of the wheel and aqueduct.}}
The [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)#History|Lotteries Act 1993]] resulted in the creation of the [[Millennium Commission]] to disseminate funds raised by the sale of lottery tickets for selected "good causes."<ref name=p1885>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1885}}</ref> In 1996, when sufficient funds had been accumulated, the Commission invited applications to "do anything they thought desirable ... to support worthwhile causes which would mark the year 2000 and the start of the new millenium."<ref name=p1885/> The conditions were that the Commission would fund no more than half of the project, with the remaining balance being covered by project backers.<ref name=p1885/>

The BWB had made an earlier plan for the reopening of the canal link, which comprehensively covered the necessary work.<ref name=p1885/> In 1994, the BWB announced its plan to bid for funding, which was submitted in 1995 on behalf of the Millenium Link Partnership.<ref>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|pp=1885-1886}}</ref> The plans called for the canals to be opened to their original operating dimensions, with {{convert|3|m}} of space above the water. The whole project had a budget of <U+00A3>78 million.<ref name=p1886>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1886}}</ref>

On [[Valentine's Day]] 1997, the Commission announced it would support the Link with <U+00A3>32 million of funding, 42% of the project cost.<ref>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1887}}</ref> The Wheel and its associated basin was priced at <U+00A3>17 million, more than a fifth of the total budget.<ref>{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1889}}</ref> Another <U+00A3>46 million had to be raised in the next two years before construction could commence, with contributions from BWB, seven local councils, [[Scottish Enterprise]], and private donations being augmented by <U+00A3>8.6 million from the [[European Regional Development Fund]].<ref name=p1890/>

===Design===
The Morrison-Bachy Soletanche Joint Venture Team submitted their original design, which resembled a [[ferris wheel]] with four gondolas in 1999. It was agreed by all parties that the design was functional, but not the showpiece the BWB were looking for.<ref name=bacsol/><ref name=gent>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentles.info/link/Concept/Ferris.htm |title=The Falkirk Ferris Wheel |publisher=gentles.info |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> After being asked to reconsider, a 20-strong team of architects and engineers led by [[Tony Kettle]] from architects [[RMJM]] came up with the final design during a three-week period in the summer of 1999.<ref name=bacsol/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://millenniumnow.org.uk/themes/transform/millennium-link-falkirk-wheel/ |title=Building the missing link |publisher=millenniumnow.org.uk |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=infv>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/~swelch/Site_visits/FalkirkWheel_infosheet.pdf |title=Falkirk Wheel site visit <U+2013> information sheet |publisher=University of Edinburgh |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> Kettle worked out aspects of the construction using his 8-year-old daughter's [[Lego]], and built a model which was shown to clients and funders.<ref name=c206>{{harvnb|Crawford|2013|p=206}}</ref><ref name=infv/> The final design was a cooperative effort between the British Waterways Board, engineering consultants [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]], [[Butterley Engineering]] and RMJM.<ref name="p1890">{{harvnb|Paterson|2013|p=1890}}</ref>

Inspirations for the design include a double-headed Celtic axe, the propellor of a ship and the ribcage of a whale.<ref name=ew>{{cite web |url=http://www.elevator-world.com/files/dec07.pdf |title=The Falkirk Wheel |first=Lee |last=Freeland |publisher=elevator-world.com}}</ref> Kettle described the Wheel as "a beautiful, organic flowing thing, like the spine of a fish,"<ref name=c206/> and the [[Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland]] described it as "a form of contemporary sculpture."<ref name=p1890/>

Models and renderings of the Falkirk Wheel were displayed in a 2012 exhibition at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/178524/british_deisgn_updated_final.pdf |title=British Design 1948-2012: Innovation in the Modern Age |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> Since 2007, the Falkirk Wheel has been featured on the obverse of the new series of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|<U+00A3>50 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of Scotland]].

===Construction===
[[File:Boat emerging at the upper level from the Falkirk Wheel - geograph.org.uk - 142581.jpg|thumb|left|View of the aqueduct and top of the wheel.]]
In March 1999 by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] cut the first [[sod]] of turf to begin work at lock 31 on the Forth and Clyde canal.<ref name=p1890/> Over 1000 people were employed in the construction of the wheel,<ref name=qqf/> which has been designed to last for at least 120 years.<ref name="ew" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentles.info/link/MillenniumLinkProject/Falkirk%20Wheel.htm |title=Reinventing the Wheel |publisher=gentles.info |accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref>

The wheel was fully constructed and assembled at the [[Butterley Engineering]] plant in [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]], [[Derbyshire]]. The structure was then dismantled in the summer of 2001, and transported on 35 lorry loads to Falkirk, before being reassembled into five sections on the ground and lifted into place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk/about-the-wheel-/design-and-engineering |title=Design and engineering |publisher=The Falkirk Wheel |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref> Construction of the canal required  {{convert|250000|m3}} of excavation, a {{convert|160|m}} canal tunnel of {{convert|8|m}} [[diameter]], [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueducts]] of {{convert|20|m}} and {{convert|120|m}}, three set of locks and a number of bridges, as well as {{convert|600|m}} of access roads.<ref name="ed" /> The 180m Roughcastle Tunnel was driven in three stages, with the two upper quarters being drilled with a standard  [[excavator]] before the lower half was dug using a modified road planer in {{convert|100|mm}} layers. This technique was 15% cheaper and reduced the build time of the tunnel by two weeks.<ref name="infv" />

===Technical considerations===
[[File:The Falkirk Wheel under Construction - geograph.org.uk - 917520.jpg|thumb|right|The construction of the basin.]]
The ground on which the wheel is built was previously used as an open cast [[fire clay]] mine, a coal mine, and a [[tar]] works, resulting in contamination of the canal with tar and [[mercury]].<ref name=infv/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?&id=f6vaAAAAMAAJ |title=Review of the Session |journal=Royal Society of Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages=91-92}}</ref> {{convert|20|m}} of loosely packed backfill from the mining operations containing large [[sandstone]] boulders was not considered adequately solid [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] for the size of the structure, so [[deep foundation]]s with thirty {{convert|22|m}} concrete piles socketed onto the [[bedrock]] were used.<ref name=infv/>

Due to the changing load as the wheel rotates in alternating directions, some sections experience total [[Stress (mechanics)|stress reversals]]. In order to avoid [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] that could lead to cracks, sections were bolted rather than welded, using over 14,000 bolts and 45,000 bolt holes.<ref name=ew/><ref name=infv/><ref name=qqf/>

The aqueduct, engineered by [[Arup Group Limited|ARUP]], was originally described as "unbuildable," but was eventually realised using 40mm [[rebar]].<ref name=ed/><ref name=et/> The original plans also showed the canal being built straight through the [[Antonine Wall]], but this was changed after a petition in favour of two locks and a tunnel under the wall.<ref name=gent/>

===Opening ceremony===

On 24 May 2002, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] opened the Falkirk Wheel as part of her [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]] celebrations. The opening was delayed a month due to flooding caused by vandals who forced open the wheel's gates.<ref name=sop>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/wheel-back-on-roll-after-vandalism-repair-work-1-862088 |title=Wheel back on roll after vandalism repair work |work=The Scotsman |date=14 October 2002 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref> The damage, which cost <U+00A3>350,000 to repair, resulted in the dry well being flooded, damaging electrical and hydraulic equipment.<ref name=sop/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentles.info/link/Vandals/vandals.html |title=Falkirk Wheel Vandalism |publisher=gentles.info |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref>

==Operation==
===Structure===
[[File:cog mechanism falkirk.jpg|thumbnail|left|The ring gears]]
The wheel has an overall diameter of {{convert|35|m}} and consists of two opposing arms extending 15 metres beyond the central axle and taking the shape of a Celtic-inspired, [[Labrys|double-headed axe]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rCQSAQAAMAAJ |journal=Siviele Ingenieurswese |title=Giant rotating wheel carries boats between canals |page=145 |volume=10 |year=2002}}</ref><ref name=i29>{{harvnb|InCom|2009|p=26}}</ref><ref name=asme>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/transportation/symbol-of-the-millennium-the-falkirk-wheel |title=Symbol of the Millennium: The Falkirk Wheel |publisher=ASME |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> Two sets of these axe-shaped arms are connected to a {{convert|3.8|m}} diameter central axle of length {{convert|28|m}}.<ref>{{harvnb|American Society of Civil Engineers|2001|p=48}}</ref> Two [[Antipodal point|diametrically opposed]] water-filled [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]], each with a capacity of {{convert|250000|l}}, are fitted between the ends of the arms.<ref name=qqf>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk/about-the-wheel-/quick-quirky-facts |title=Quick quirky facts |publisher=The Falkirk Wheel |accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref>

The caissons or gondolas always carry a combined weight of {{convert|500|t}} of water and boats, with the gondolas themselves each weighing {{convert|50|t}}.<ref name=infv/> Care is taken to maintain the water levels on each side, thus balancing the weight on each arm. According to [[Archimedes' principle]], floating objects displace their own weight in water, so when the boat enters, the amount of water leaving the caisson weighs exactly the same as the boat.<ref name=qqf/><ref name=asme/> This is achieved by maintaining the water levels on each side to within <U+00B1>{{convert|37|mm}} using a site-wide computer control system comprising water level sensors, automated [[sluice]]s and pumps.<ref name=bacsol>{{cite web |url=http://www.bacsol.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/A399-The-Falkirk-Wheel.pdf |title=Civil Engineering: The Falkirk Wheel |publisher=bacsol.co.uk |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=infv/> It takes just {{convert|22.5|kW}} to power ten [[hydraulic motor]]s, which consume just {{convert|1.5|kWh}} per half-turn, roughly the same as boiling eight kettles of water.<ref name=infv/> 

The two caissons are {{convert|6.5|m}} wide, and can hold up to four {{convert|20|m}} long [[Narrowboat|canal boats]].<ref name=et>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=936 |title=Falkirk Wheel |publisher=engineering-timelines.com |accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref> Watertight doors at each end match doors located on the upper structure and lower dock pit. Due to space concerns, where a normal hinged door would dramatically reduce the useful length of the caisson, vertically rising doors were chosen.<ref name=door>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentles.info/link/doors-seals/doors-and-seals.html |title=Falkirk Wheel Doors and Seals |publisher=gentles.info |accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref> The doors are raised from a recess in the base of the caisson and powered by a hydraulic lance when docked.<ref name=door/>

===Engine room===
The area housing the machinery to drive the wheel is located in the final pillar of the aqueduct, and contains seven chambers connected by ladders.<ref name=tt/> Access is by a door located at ground level or an entrance halfway up the tower with a [[gantry crane]] to facilitate the installation of equipment.<ref name=tt/>

The ground floor houses the [[transformer]]s for powering the wheel. When the wheel was flooded by vandals in April 2002, this room was filled to within 3 inches of the 11kV [[busbar]]s.<ref name=tt/> On the first floor is a standby generator and [[switchgear]] should the [[Mains electricity|mains supply]] to the wheel fail.<ref name=tt/> The second floor houses a pair of [[hydraulic pump]]s that drive the [[hydraulic motor]]s in the chamber above.<ref name=tt/> Power is supplied directly to the axle with 10 hydraulic motors, which also double as brakes. Connected to each motor is a 100:1 gear system to reduce the rotation speed.<ref name="tt" />

===Mechanism===
[[File:FalkirkRotate04.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of the mechanism using [[Lego]]. Lead architect Tony Kettle used a different Lego model to demonstrate the mechanism to clients and funders.]]
The caissons are required to turn with the wheel in order to remain level. Whilst the weight of the caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.<ref name=hdiw>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk/about-the-wheel-/how-does-it-work |title=How does it work? |publisher=The Falkirk Wheel |accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>

Each end of each caisson is supported on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the eight-metre diameter holes at the ends of the arms.<ref name=hdiw/> The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three eight-metre diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture.<ref name=hdiw/> The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating.<ref name=hdiw/><ref name=tt>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentles.info/link/technicaltour/technical.html |title=Falkirk Wheel Drive Chamber Visit |publisher=gentles.info |accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large ring gears at the end of the caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.<ref name=hdiw/>

===Docking-pit===
[[File:Falkirk wheel.jpg|thumb|right|The Falkirk Wheel in action. The wedge-shaped building on the right is the visitors' centre. Note the Docking Pit at the bottom canal.]]
The docking-pit is a [[drydock|drydock-like]] port isolated from the lower canal basin by means of watertight gates and kept dry by means of water pumps.<ref name=ew/> When the wheel stops with its arms in the vertical position it is possible for boats to enter and exit the lower caisson when the gates are open without flooding the docking-pit. The space below the caisson is empty.<ref name=ew/><ref name=et/>

Without the docking-pit, the caissons and extremities of the arms of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated.<ref name=ew/> The [[buoyancy]] of the lower caisson would make it more difficult to turn the wheel.<ref name=ew/>

===Visitor centre===
A visitor centre is located on the east side of the lower basin.<ref name=p1890/> Boat trips on the wheel depart approximately once an hour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefalkirkwheel.co.uk/plan-your-visit/opening-times |title=Opening Times |publisher=The Falkirk Wheel |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> Since the wheel opened, around 4.4 million people have visited and 1.3 million have taken a boat trip, with around 400,000 people visiting the wheel annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scottishtourismalliance.co.uk/falkirk-wheel-is-a-big-success/ |title=Falkirk Wheel is a big success |publisher=Scottish Tourism Alliance |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/feb/23/british-tourist-attractions-visitor-figures |title=British tourist attraction visitors figures: who's up and who's down? |work=The Guardian |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>
