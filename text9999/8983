'''Intrade''' was an online [[betting exchange|trading exchange]] website.  The website's members bet on the outcomes of non-sports-related future events. Intrade was founded by [[John Delaney (businessman)|John Delaney]] in 1999<ref>[[Daniel Gross]], "John Delaney, Founder of Intrade, Dies at 42," ''New York Times'', May 26, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Intrade |url=http://www.intrade.com/v4/misc/about/aboutUs.jsp |title=What is Intrade all about? |publisher=Intrade.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> and acquired by [[Tradesports]] in 2003.<ref name=McLoughlin>Grainne McLoughlin, "Betting on Success," ''Sunday Business Post'', January 25, 2004.</ref> Dublin-based owner '''Trade Exchange Network Limited''' also operated TradeBetX.com, which focused on European interests. As of January 1, 2007, Trade Exchange Network divested its interests in Tradesports and TradeBetX.com to a newly formed company, '''TradeSports Ltd.''' These two websites offered only sports-related trading markets until they were closed in 2008, while Intrade.com continues to offer exclusively non-sports exchange markets (politics, finance, entertainment, current events, transportation, legal, weather, pop culture, etc.).

Intrade's system is a [[prediction market]] which allows individuals to take positions (trade 'contracts') on whether future events will or will not occur.  An example event is a political election, which is almost always settled in a well-defined and verifiable manner.  The contract might be "Mitt Romney to win 2012 U.S. presidential election." Other events include financial predictions, such as "NASDAQ Average to close higher today." Intrade facilitates trades between members, charging a monthly fee,<ref>[http://www.intrade.com/v4/misc/howItWorks/fees.jsp Intrade Fee Structure]</ref> but does not participate in trading itself.

Trading positions are provided in the common nomenclature of ''long'' (will happen) and ''short'' (will not happen). The trading unit is a contract with a notional settlement value, typically $10, and the contract may trade in range of 0<U+2013>100 where 1 point equals US$0.10 in value. If the event specified in a given contract occurs, the contract settles at 100 points or $10; otherwise, the contract settles at 0 or $0 in value. Thus, the current price of the contract can be imputed as the market's global opinion of the [[probability]] that the specified event will occur.

Because most events take place over a well-defined time span, traders can trade both before and during an event. The exchange likes to have dedicated [[market maker]]s in its benchmark markets to provide a two way price at almost all times.

Intrade provides both real money and play money prediction market trading.<ref>[https://www.intrade.com/jsp/intrade/help/exchange-rules.html#agree Intrade Exchange Rules - The agreement]</ref> The minimum deposit for opening a real money account is [[US$]]25.00, but US$100 is recommended to "fully appreciate the trading experience".<ref>[https://www.intrade.com/jsp/intrade/help/exchange-rules.html#account Intrade Exchange Rules - Depositing funds]</ref>

In the fourth quarter of 2012, trading volume dropped precipitously following announcement that the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] had brought a suit against Intrade for unregulated trading in traditional commodities, such as gold.<ref name=philips2013>{{Citation

In their announcement, Intrade said they are potentially investigating financial irregularities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21743455 |title=BBC News - Intrade shuts amid investigation |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> Intrade is refusing to comment.

==Contracts==
Intrade allows bets on a wide range of future outcomes: political events (in the US, India, Germany, Israel etc.), climate change, current events (bird flu, earthquakes etc.), entertainment (Academy Awards, American Idol, Dancing with the Stars), science (will the [[Higgs boson]] be observed?), technology (web browser market share, Google [[Lunar X Prize]], Apple iPad unit sales), finance ([[Dow Jones Industrial Average|DJIA]], [[S&P 500]], [[NASDAQ-100]], gold price), but does not predict stocks or sports competitions. However, Intrade does operate markets on sports-related events that do not involve athletic competition, such as bids to host an [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. Sister site [http://intrade.net intrade.net] (since closed) allowed the creation of custom markets.

===Political contracts===
Intrade has offered since 2002 the widest range of markets for political events, such as the outcomes of U.S. presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections.

==Fees==
===Service fees===

Intrade charges users a flat fee of $4.99 per month, charged on the first day of the month.  The fee is charged to all accounts with a balance even if the account was inactive and executed no trades during that month.  Accounts with no balance are not charged.  In addition, accounts inactive for 18 months or longer are assessed a $5.00 dormant account fee which is deducted from the account's available balance.<ref name="Intrade Fees">{{cite web|url=https://www.intrade.com/v4/misc/howItWorks/fees.jsp|title=Intrade Fees|publisher=Intrade|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

===Withdrawal fees===

For customers requesting a check withdrawal, Intrade issues a banker's draft, which is similar to a Cashier's check in the United States.<ref name="Intrade Rules">{{cite web|title=Intrade Rules|url=https://www.intrade.com/v4/misc/howItWorks/exchangeRules.jsp|publisher=Intrade|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref> For the first check in a given month, there is no fee.<ref name="Intrade Rules" /> However, customers are required to pay the cost to issue the check which is deducted by the bank from the amount of the withdrawal.<ref name="Intrade Rules" />  The current cost to issue a check is <U+20AC>4.00.<ref name="Intrade Rules" />  If an account holder wishes to make more than one check withdrawal within a calendar month, they will be charged an additional $10.00 fee for each check after the first.<ref name="Intrade Rules" />  There is no cost for standard delivery. For customers requiring expedited delivery, Intrade will ship checks via FedEx with a tracking number for a $30.00 fee.<ref name="Withdraw Funds">{{cite web|title=Withdraw Funds from Your Account|url=https://www.intrade.com/v4/account/withdraw/|publisher=Intrade|accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

In addition to check withdrawals, account holders may withdraw funds via wire transfer.  Intrade charges a $20.00 fee for each wire transfer.  Customers must also pay any and all fees incurred during the wire transfer, regardless of whether those fees originate from the initiating bank, the receiving bank, or any intermediary bank.<ref name="Intrade Rules" /><ref name="Withdraw Funds" />

==Disputes==
While the vast majority of the thousands of markets listed have had easily verifiable outcomes, some have not, and disputes have arisen over the wording of some contracts.  

In July, 2006, TradeSports, (closed now, but previously related to Intrade), conceded <ref>"Expiry of North Korea Missile Test Contract" http://www.tradesports.com/aav2/news/news_58.html.</ref> that one of these contracts was problematic. The contract allowed speculation on whether North Korea would, by 31 July 2006, successfully fire ballistic missiles that would land outside its airspace. On 5 July 2006 the North Korean government claimed [[2006 North Korean missile test|a successful test launch]] that would have satisfied the prediction, a launch widely reported by world media. Tradesports declared that the contract's [[Condition precedent|conditions]] had not been met, because the [[US Department of Defense]] had not confirmed the action, and this confirmation was specifically required by the contract. (Other government sources had confirmed the claim, but these were not the sources referenced in the contract.) Traders considered this to be in strict compliance with the stated rule but contrary to the intention of the market (which was to predict the launch event, and not whether the US Defense Department would confirm it).

On 3 January 2012, Intrade settled contracts related to the [[Iowa caucus|2012 Iowa caucus]] in favor of bettors supporting [[Mitt Romney]], on the basis that Iowa [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] chairman [[Matt Strawn]] (incidentally a [[Rick Santorum]] supporter) had declared Romney to be the winner by a narrow margin of 8 votes, adding that there would be no recount. The contracts specified that

::"Expiry will be based on the officially declared winner of the Iowa caucus, as reported by three independent and reliable media sources."

However, the normal process of certifying the vote count (not recount) revealed simple arithmetic errors which resulted in Santorum being declared the winner (by 34 votes) on 20 January. Intrade, having already paid out winnings to Romney supporters, maintained that its original decision had been correct, since at least three reliable media sources had reported a Romney victory (though it is debatable whether they reported him to be the "officially declared winner").<ref>http://bb.intrade.com/intradeForum/posts/list/493046.page#545717</ref>

==Market data==
Intrade offers its market data to [[prediction market]] researchers.  At one time it assisted the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in a [[Policy Analysis Market|controversial scheme]] (ultimately canceled) to assess probabilities of future terrorist attacks.<ref>"Storm of Protest Forces Pentagon to Pull Plug on 'Terror Futures'," ''Evening Standard'', July 30, 2003.</ref> Intrade supplies market data at significantly discounted fees or free to academics.

==Legal status==
While Intrade operates legally from the Republic of Ireland, it does not comment on the legality of trading for customers in other countries.<ref>[http://getsatisfaction.com/intrade/topics/legality_of_trading "Legality of trading" topic on Intrade's GetSatisfaction board]</ref>

===Legal status in United States===
In 2005, Tradesports applied to the U.S. [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] for permission to open a regulated [[futures exchange]] in the United States.<ref>''U.S. Demand Spurs Dublin Firm's Exchange Bid," ''Irish Independent'', May 9, 2005.</ref>

In July 2008, not having an official decision, Intrade sent a letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission asking for clarification of the legal status of intrade.com and its executive leadership in the United States, saying "While Intrade serves a global community and has registered members from 162 countries, our 82,000 plus membership are predominantly resident in the United States ... it is perversely unclear as to whether Intrade, and indeed myself, are considered persona gratis by the United States."<ref>The 2008 [http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/frcomment/08-004c014.pdf letter] to the CFTC from the Intrade CEO, John Delaney</ref>

Due to banking regulations that came into force in 2010, American customers were prohibited from funding their accounts with credit or debit cards issued by a US bank.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deposit by Card|url=https://www.intrade.com/v4/account/deposit/card/|publisher=Intrade.com|accessdate=27 March 2011|quote=If your credit or debit card was issued by a US bank then we are very sorry to have to inform you that due to US banking regulations that came into force in 2010 you will almost certainly not be able to use it on Intrade.t/deposit/card/}}</ref>

On November 26, 2012, the [[U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] filed a civil suit in federal district court in Washington, D.C. seeking an injunction against Intrade allowing U.S. citizens to trade on their site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6423-12|title=CFTC Charges Ireland-based "Prediction Market" Proprietors Intrade and TEN with Violating the CFTC<U+2019>s Off-Exchange Options Trading Ban and Filing False Forms with the CFTC|date=2012-11-26|publisher=[[U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission]]}}</ref> The US CFTC claimed that Intrade's operation interfered with the CFTC's role "to police market activity and protect market integrity". Shortly thereafter (though not explicitly in direct response), Intrade announced it would no longer allow U.S. customers to participate in the real-money version of the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/on-air/stossel/blog/2012/11/26/government-crushes-innovative-online-prediction-market|title=Government Crushes Innovative Online Prediction Market}}</ref>  Intrade announced that all existing U.S.-based accounts would be suspended on December 23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intrade.com/news/id/782|title=ATTENTION U.S. CUSTOMERS|publisher='''Intrade'''|archivedate=2012-11-28|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CVaaee6B}}</ref>

==Death of CEO==
On May 24, 2011, it was announced that the founder and CEO of Intrade, [[John Delaney (businessman)|John Delaney]], died while attempting to climb Mount Everest. Delaney died 50 meters from the summit.  His body could not be recovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/climber-dies-after-third-child-born-16003727.html |title=Climber dies after third child born |publisher=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/business/27delaney.html?ref=deathsobituaries|title=John Delaney, Founder of Intrade, Dies at 42|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 26, 2011|author=Julie Creswell}}</ref>
