The [[Listed building|Grade I listed]] Saxon '''church of [[Botwulf of Thorney|St Botolph's ]]''' at [[Botolphs]], [[West Sussex]], England, is situated in the valley of the [[River Adur]] and is now part of the Church of England parish of [[Upper Beeding|Beeding]] and [[Bramber]] with Botolphs.  An earlier dedication to '''St Peter de Vetere Ponte''' (St Peter of the Old Bridge) is now lost, like the bridge over the Adur from which it took this ancient name.<ref name="Arnold731">{{Harvnb|Arnold|1932|p=731.}}</ref>  The church serves the [[Deserted medieval village|mostly depopulated]] [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Botolphs in the [[Horsham (district)|Horsham]] [[Districts of England|district]] of [[West Sussex]]. The church has fragments of medieval [[Mural|wall paintings]]. Architectural historian [[Ian Nairn]] comments that the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] pulpit is "notable in a county which is poor in 17th century fittings".<ref name="Pevsner113">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=113.}}</ref> 
== History ==
The parish of Botolphs came into existence in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon era]] as one of several long, narrow divisions of land on the southern slopes of the [[South Downs]] near the River Adur, which reached the [[English Channel]] at the port of [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]].  Like neighbouring Beeding and Bramber, Botolphs' territory stretched for about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from west to east.<ref name="VCH18251">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18251|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1 <U+2013> Bramber Rape (Southern Part).

The lie of the land meant that two settlements developed separately in the parish: there were two areas of high ground rising from a flood-prone [[alluvial plain]].<ref name="VCH18251"/>  Some flint cottages were built around Annington [[manor house]] and its farm,<ref name="VCH18251"/><ref name="Pevsner113"/> and a few others were clustered around the church.  The latter settlement was known as Old Bridge before acquiring the name Botolphs, and both the name and archaeological evidence (in the form of Roman-era masonry found in the fields) suggest that the church was built near the site of the now vanished bridge over the river.<ref name="VCH18251"/><ref name="Arnold731<U+2013>732">{{Harvnb|Arnold|1932|pp=731<U+2013>732.}}</ref><ref name="Wales36">{{Harvnb|Wales|1999|p=36.}}</ref>

The Domesday survey mentioned a church at Annington as well as the manor house,<ref name="VCH18251"/><ref name="Arnold732"/> and architectural evidence suggests that St Botolph's Church is of Saxon origin<U+2014>confirming that only one church served the parish,<ref name="Pevsner113"/><ref name="Fisher63">{{Harvnb|Fisher|1970|p=63.}}</ref> rather than each settlement having its own place of worship as was once believed.<ref name="Arnold732"/>  The dedication to St Botolph is thought to be original; but around the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the church was officially rededicated to St Peter de Vetere Ponte (meaning St Peter of the Old Bridge).  In 1254, the dedication to St Botolph reappeared in print, and the two names were used interchangeably for a period as use of the old name was maintained by locals.<ref name="Arnold732"/> By the 15th century, the newer dedication to St Peter fell out of use.<ref name="VCH18251"/>  Another historic dedication, to St Mary, has also been suggested.<ref name="Wales36"/>  The existence of another St Peter's Church at nearby [[Upper Beeding|Beeding]] has been suggested as a reason for the dedication reverting to St Botolph.<ref name="Coppin106"/>

The river Adur was originally navigable as far as Bramber; but the sea began to recede in about 1350, and the river silted up, after which the bridge at Botolphs fell into disuse and the [[Deserted medieval village|village population declined]].  The crossing point had apparently been in use for about 1,000 years (as suggested by the Roman rubble found nearby), and when it was lost the village could no longer thrive.<ref name="Coppin106"/>  In 1526 Botolphs was incorporated into Bramber parish.<ref name="VCH18251"/><ref name="Coppin106"/>  Structurally, the church expanded and contracted over the centuries in line with the changing population.  In its original form, it was an aisleless building with [[nave]] and [[chancel]].<ref name="VCH18251"/>  In the 13th century, a tower was added;<ref name="Pevsner113"/> and in about 1250 an aisle was added to the north side, separated from the nave by an arcade of three [[Bay (architecture)|bays]].<ref name="Pevsner113"/><ref name="Arnold732"/>  The chancel was altered and new windows were inserted in the 14th century.  The tower was equipped with a peal of three bells in 1536.<ref name="VCH18251"/>  The aisle, which apparently housed a shrine to St Botolph, St Peter and Mary,<ref name="Arnold732"/> became dilapidated by the late 18th century as the population fell; it had been demolished by 1830,<ref name="VCH18251"/> leaving the three blank arches of the arcade on the north wall.<ref name="Salter87>{{Harvnb|Salter|2000|p=87.}}</ref>

A [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] vicarage existed by 1615.<ref name="VCH18252"/>  It may date from the 14th century, and the building still stands next to the church<U+2014>albeit with structural alteration.  It was [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade II by English Heritage on 9 May 1980.<ref name="NHLE-1027460">{{cite web|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1027460|title=Vicarage Cottage, Botolphs, Bramber, Horsham, West Sussex|year=2011|work=The National Heritage List for England|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>

== Architecture, fittings and setting ==
[[File:Botolphs Church - geograph.org.uk - 20235.jpg|thumb|right|The church, with a prominently [[buttress]]ed tower, stands in an isolated [[South Downs|downland]] setting.]]
St Botolph's Church is in "a peaceful spot"<ref name="Wales36"/> next to the River Arun, although the former Beeding Cement Works and the [[Steyning Line|Shoreham<U+2013>Horsham railway line]] were both a short distance away on the other side of the river (both have ceased operating).<ref name="Wales36"/>  Writing in 1932, one historian noted that interest in the church and [[Coombes Church|its similarly isolated neighbour]] at [[Coombes]] had been reinvigorated by the building of a new road along the river between [[Steyning]] and the coast, which encouraged visitors to come to the "little lost [[South Downs|Down<nowiki>[</nowiki>land<nowiki>]</nowiki>]] churches".<ref name="Arnold731"/>  The church was less well regarded in the [[Victorian era]]: one 19th-century writer dismissed it as "small and uninteresting".<ref name="Wales36"/>  [[Ian Nairn]] considered it "simple and mellow",<ref name="Pevsner113"/> while others have praised the "clean lines [and] perfect setting"<ref name="Coppin106">{{Harvnb|Coppin|2006|p=106.}}</ref> of the "small, attractive church".<ref name="BMR148">{{Harvnb|Beevers|Marks|Roles|1989|p=148.}}</ref>

[[File:Tapsel gate at Botolphs church, West Sussex.jpg|thumb|left|The church has a modern [[Tapsel gate]].]]
The nave and chancel are Saxon, but their date is unknown.<ref name="Fisher63"/>  The nave has long and narrow Saxon proportions of about {{convert|55|ft|6|in|m}} long by {{convert|17|ft|6|in|m}} wide by the interior measure. At the west end of the south wall is an original round-headed Saxon window. The south doorway is 17th century, with a modern porch.<ref name="Fisher63"/>  The chancel is about {{convert|16|ft|m}} long and {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide on the interior.<ref name="Fisher64">{{Harvnb|Fisher|1970|p=64.}}</ref> The chancel arch is of one order with the late Saxon feature of a soffit roll.<ref name="Fisher65">{{Harvnb|Fisher|1970|p=65.}}</ref>

The three-bay north aisle added in about 1250<ref name="Fisher65"/> had a three-arched arcade.  By the early 19th century the arches were filled in and the aisle was demolished<U+2014>evidence of the declining population and importance of Botolphs, which had become a [[Deserted medieval village|shrunken medieval settlement]] with only a few surviving houses.<ref name="VCH18251"/><ref name="BMR148"/>  The remains of the pointed arches are a prominent feature of the north wall.<ref name="Coppin106"/>

Traces of the wall paintings were recorded in 1897. When examined in about 1932 they were thought to be from a "Doom" scheme of painting, including depictions of St John and the Virgin Mary with a bishop. However only a few indistinct patches are visible today.<ref name="VCH18251"/>

The pulpit "almost certainly dates from 1630<U+201D> and was formerly painted blue.<ref name="Allen.">{{Harvnb|Allen|2010}}</ref> It is covered with incised abstract patterns.<ref name="Pevsner113"/>

One of the three 1536 bells commemorates the old dedication to St Peter with the inscription <U+201C>Sancte Petre ora pro nobis<U+201D>.<ref name="Unknown author7">{{Harvnb|Unknown author|No date|p=7.}}</ref>

A modern [[Tapsel gate]] dating from 2003 links the churchyard to an adjacent civil burial ground, operated jointly by the three civil parish councils of Bramber, Upper Beeding, and Steyning. The Rector of Botolphs sits (ex officio) on the Joint Parishes Burial Board, and an annual memorial service for the council burial ground in held in the church. The tapsel gate was funded by the joint parish councils to facilitate the use of the church by visitors to the burial ground. It was officially opened and dedicated early in 2004 by the [[Bishop of Horsham]].

The [[advowson]] (the right to appoint clergy) has been held by the [[Bishop of Chichester]] since 1953, along with that of St Nicholas' Church at Bramber with which it has been united since 1526,<ref name="VCH18252">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=18252|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1 <U+2013> Bramber Rape (Southern Part).

The three churches now form a single ecclesiastical parish, with one [[Parochial Church Council]].  The advowson had originally been held by [[Sele Priory]] at nearby Beeding; this was linked to the Abbey Church of St Florent at [[Saumur]] in [[Normandy]], to which the church belonged at the time of the Domesday survey.  Most of the priory's holdings, including the advowson, were transferred to [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in the late 15th century, and except for a few years from 1475 this institution nominated the [[rector]] until 1953, when the right of presentation was voluntarily surrendered to the Bishop of Chichester.<ref name="VCH18251"/><ref name="VCH18252"/>

One Sunday service is held each month, on the evening of the first Sunday.  Other services are held at the other two churches in the parish<U+2014>at Bramber and Upper Beeding.<ref name="ACNY-Botolphs">{{cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/botolphs-st-botolph/|title=St Botolph, Botolphs|year=2010|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>  The joint parish, which serves about 5,000 people in the three villages and the surrounding rural area, was officially created in 1987 from the merger of Bramber-cum-Botolphs and Beeding parishes.<ref name="ACNY-100303">{{cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish/100303/|title=Beeding and Bramber with Botolphs|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>  Births, marriages and deaths in the parish since 1601 are recorded in the parish registers.<ref name="VCH18251"/>
