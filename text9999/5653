'''Scott David Schoeneweis''' [SHOW-en-weiss] (born October 2, {{by|1973}}, in {{city-state|Long Branch|New Jersey}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[left-handed]] [[Major League Baseball]] [[relief pitcher]] who is currently a free agent. In the five seasons from 2003-07, Schoeneweis allowed only one [[home run]] to a left-handed batter. Left-handed hitters [[batting average|batted]] .209, with a .264 [[slugging percentage]] and .293 [[on base percentage]], in 227 plate appearances against him from 2005-06,<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Marty Noble&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070204&content_id=1794314&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym |title=The Official Site of The New York Mets: News: New York Mets News |publisher=Newyork.mets.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref> and then only .207 with a .241 slugging percentage in 2007.

==Early life==
Schoenweiss grew up in {{city-state|Mount Laurel Township|New Jersey}}.<ref name=Inq2002>Wagman, Jake. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F6D310CE07CADB5&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "He is Mount Laurel's Angel"], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', October 21, 2002. Accessed December 26, 2007. "The parents of World Series pitcher Scott Schoeneweis want to set the record straight. Yes, he was born at a hospital in Long Branch, Monmouth County. And he did attend Lenape High School in Medford."</ref>  He attended [[Lenape High School]] in {{city-state|Medford|New Jersey}}, where he lettered in [[baseball]] and [[basketball]]<ref name=Inq2002/> before playing collegiately at [[Duke University]], where he was a 1993 [[All-American]] as a freshman. That season, he had 12 wins, the second best record in the school's history.

At age 19, he was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] while playing the summer league in [[Cape Cod]]. The cancer had already spread to his [[lymph nodes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.duke.edu/modules/firsthand47/index.php?id=25 |title=Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center - Surviving and Thriving-Scott Schoeneweis |publisher=Cancer.duke.edu |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref> To get back on the field by January, he requested an aggressive course of chemotherapy consisting of 3 week-long sessions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} He said he took "6 months of [[chemotherapy]] in 3 months," and commented that "it puts things in perspective."<ref name="jvl"/> Schoeneweis overcame the cancer, but lost 20 pounds.<ref name="espn-steroids"/>

He returned to the team the following season, but was unable to win a single game in his weakened condition. He seriously injured his pitching elbow, perhaps as a result of his loss in strength, and required [[Tommy John surgery]]. He lost his slider, and was only throwing an 80 [[mph]] [[fastball]] after [[reconstructive surgery]]. He spent the following summer rehabilitating and lifting weights before returning to pitch his senior year at Duke University. He enjoyed a sensational season with 10 wins, and graduated with a [[history]] degree. Schoeneweis finished as Duke's career leader with 30 wins and 51 games started, and is second on the school's all-time [[strikeout]]s list (315).

He played for the [[United States national baseball team|USA National Team]] in {{by|1996}} before being drafted by the [[California Angels]] in the third round of the [[1996 Major League Baseball Draft]].

==Baseball career==
===Pitching===
Schoeneweis has three [[Pitch (baseball)|pitches]]: a sinking 89-90&nbsp;mph fastball and [[slider]], which are his better pitches, and a [[changeup]].  He is able to get his fastball in on lefties, which keeps them off his [[breaking ball]] on the outside corner.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Steve Gilbert&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090216&content_id=3837328&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Melvin praises new D-backs pitchers &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref> 
He is a ground-ball pitcher and has been used many times as a [[lefty specialist]].<ref name="jvl">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Schoeneweis.html |title=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |publisher=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>

===Minor Leagues===
From 1996-{{by|2000}}, in the minor leagues, Schoeneweis was 28-20. In the {{by|1997}} [[Arizona Fall League]], he went 3-2 with a 1.98 [[earned run average]] for the [[Scottsdale Scorpions]], finishing second in ERA behind [[Rolando Arrojo]].

===Anaheim Angels (1999-2003)===
Schoeneweis started his MLB career with the [[Anaheim Angels]], where in {{by|1999}}, he appeared in 31 games and finishing the year with a 1-1 record. His season was cut short by a torn [[medial collateral ligament]] in his left elbow.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The next season he was used as a [[starting pitcher]], pitching in 27 games, all starts, as he went 7-10 with a 5.45 ERA.

In {{by|2001}}, during which the Angels continued using him as a starter (beginning with opening day), he won a career-high 10 games and finished with a 5.08 ERA. He hit 14 batters (third in the [[American League]]).

In {{by|2002}}, Schoeneweis was used primarily as a reliever, though he did make 15 starts. He lowered his ERA to 4.88, and left-handed batters batted only .202 against him. He also won 9 games, while losing 8. At the conclusion of the season, the Angels captured the American League [[wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] and qualified for the postseason.

Schoeneweis appeared in three games versus the defending American League Champion [[New York Yankees]], giving up 1 earned run. Anaheim took the series 3 games to 1 over the heavily favored [[New York City|New York]] team, and battled past the [[Minnesota Twins]] in the [[2002 American League Championship Series]] in five games. Scott appeared in one of those games, and did not surrender a run in 0.2 innings pitched. In the [[2002 World Series]], Schoeneweis pitched in two games and held the [[San Francisco Giants]] off the [[scoreboard]] in the two innings he pitched. The Angels captured the World Series title in seven games. He started the 2003 season with the Angels.

===Chicago White Sox (2003-04)===
During the season, he was dealt to the [[Chicago White Sox]] after appearing in 39 games, all in relief, for Anaheim. He was traded with Doug Nickle for [[Gary Glover]], [[Scott Dunn]], and Tim Bittner on July 30. He finished the year with a combined 3-2 record between the Angels and ChiSox, to go along with his 4.18 ERA in 59 games. He was the recipient of the {{by|2003}} [[Gene Autry]] Courage Award.

The next season he was used mainly as a starting pitcher by Chicago [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Ozzie Guill<U+00E9>n]], going 6-9. He held batters to a .111 batting average in games that were late and close.

''[[ESPN]]'' reported in 2007, that in 2003 and 2004 Schoeneweis received six steroid shipments from Signature Pharmacy while playing for the Chicago White Sox. Schoeneweis denied the report, and told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' that he has never heard of Signature Pharmacy or received shipments from Florida.<ref name="espn-steroids">

===Toronto Blue Jays (2005-06)===
He was signed as a free agent by the [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] on January 11, 2005, for $2,500,000, which was just under what he made the two previous seasons combined.

During the 2005 season he slipped on a just-watered field in Oakland, and his fellow Toronto pitchers buckled over in laughter. not realizing that Schoeneweis had just sustained the worst injury of his career.  He tore a [[tendon]] behind his left knee, near his [[hamstring]], and the tendon remained torn as he pitched over the next two years.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/sports/baseball/15mets.html?ref=baseball</ref>

He ended his first season in [[Canada]] with a 3-4 mark, and picked up his second career save.  Schoeneweis<U+2019>s ERA improved to 3.32. He also saw action in a career-high 80 games (2nd in the American League). The lefty was also among the league leaders in holds, with 35. Left-handed hitters batted a meager .188 against him.  In 2006, he went 2-2 for Toronto with a high ERA of 6.51 in 55 games.

===Cincinnati Reds (2006)===
On August 16, Schoeneweis was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for cash. In 16 games for the Reds, he was 2-0 with 3 saves and an 0.63 ERA.

===New York Mets (2007-08)===
In January 2007, Schoeneweis agreed to a 3-year deal with the [[New York Mets]] worth $10.8 million.<ref name="mlbmets">{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Marty Noble&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070116&content_id=1779991&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym |title=MLB.com |publisher=Newyork.mets.mlb.com |date=January 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>  He struggled during the season, finishing with an 0-2 record, 2 saves, and a 5.03 ERA in 70 games. He did, however, hold lefties to a .204 batting average and .247 slugging percentage, and held batters to a .221 batting average when men were on base, and a .150 batting average with 2 outs and runners in scoring position. Schoeneweis later revealed that he pitched the 2007 season with a severed tendon in his left knee, affecting his push off the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shpigel |first=Ben |url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/scott-schoeneweis/ |title=SCOTT SCHOENEWEIS - Bats Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Bats.blogs.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>

In 2008 he pitched 73 times, with a 3.34 ERA.  Lefties hit only .178 against him, with a .243 obp and a .277 slugging percentage.  He tied for seventh in the National League among left-handers, with 15 holds.<ref name="article1"/>
With his 73 appearances he became the only pitcher in the major leagues to pitch in at least 70 games each of the five seasons from 2004-08.  The only other pitchers to do so in the four seasons from 2005-08 were [[Chad Qualls]], [[Bob Howry]], and [[Dan Wheeler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/pitching?split=0&league=mlb&season=2008&seasonType=2&sort=gamesPlayed&type=reg&ageMin=17&ageMax=51&state=0&college=0&country=0&hand=a&pos=all&startDate=null&endDate=null |title=MLB Baseball Pitching Statistics and League Leaders - Major League Baseball - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>  
He was the losing pitcher in both the final home opener and the final game at [[Shea Stadium]] during the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/psplit.cgi?n1=schoesc01&year=2007 |title=Scott Schoeneweis 2007 Pitching Splits - Baseball-Reference PI |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2009-present)===
On December 12, 2008, Schoeneweis was traded to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] for [[Connor Robertson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081212&content_id=3715788&vkey=pr_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari |title=D-backs acquire Scott Schoeneweis from Mets |publisher=Arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>

He started off the season very well, as in March and April, he kept batters to a .226 batting average.  Through May 20, he had given up only three earned runs in 10.2 innings.

Following his wife's sudden unexpected death on May 20, he was briefly placed on the restricted list, and then the bereavement list.  He returned to the mound on June 9, but after his return he gave up 15 earned runs in nine innings.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hrQ-hNMb6UZiRG1Sb834VonvJ0swD9A15Q4G0 "Schoeneweis on DL because of depression," ''[[Associated Press]]'', 8/11/09, accessed 8/26/09]</ref>  Batters hit .391 against him in July, and .444 in August.

He was then placed on the disabled list on August 11, 2009, to give him time to deal with depression resulting from her death and with parenting issues.  "It's obviously been a horrific year for him," Arizona manager [[A. J. Hinch]] said. "At this point, baseball becomes irrelevant."<ref>[http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/sports/grimsley-100979-appears-jury.html "Schoeneweis on DL because of depression," ''Brownsville Herald'', 8/11/09, accessed 8/26/09]</ref>

==Mitchell Report==
The [[Baseball Commissioner]]'s Office met with Schoeneweis to discuss the 2007 [[ESPN]] report's allegations.  On December 6, 2007, the Commissioner's Office announced that there was insufficient evidence of a violation of the joint program in effect at the time of the conduct in question to warrant discipline of Schoeneweis.<ref>[http://assets.espn.go.com/media/pdf/071213/mitchell_report.pdf]</ref>

Schoeneweis said the Mets and other clubs he had played for were aware of his use, which was tied to his treatment of testicular cancer, and the levels were within the limits established by the [[collective bargaining agreement]].  "I was just trying to get to normal, not above normal. It's all well-documented," Schoeneweis said.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Marty Noble&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080214&content_id=2373700&vkey=spt2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Notes: Schoeneweis clears the air &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nypost.com/sports/mets/archives/2008/02/warming_up_in_p.html |title=Mets Blog |publisher=Blogs.nypost.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>

"I think I will be OK," he said.  "It's time for Daddy to go back to work."<ref name="arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com"/>  He was placed on the disabled list on August 11, 2009, however, to give him time to deal with [[Depression (mood)|depression]] resulting from her death and with [[parenting]] issues.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-16-rogers-rankings-aug16,0,5455779.column Rogers, Phil, "Phil Rogers' baseball power rankings," ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', 8/16/09, accessed 8/26/09]</ref>
