==History==
The FM 1576 designation was originally assigned in 1949 to a short road near [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] in [[Cameron County, Texas|Cameron County]]. This mileage was transferred to {{Roadlink|state=TX|SH|4}} in 1956.

In 1957, part of {{Roadlink|state=TX|FM|2249}} and {{Roadlink|state=TX|FM|2318}}, to the east of [[Dell City, Texas|Dell City]], were canceled and combined to form FM 1576. In 1960, FM 1576 had the mileage from {{Roadlink|state=TX|FM|2636}} added to it, and it was extended southward approximately 10.1 miles to US 62 / US 180. In 1973, it was extended to the northeast to its current northern terminus.<ref name="FM 1576" />
