[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Ellis Charles Wackett''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (13&nbsp;April 1901 &ndash; 3&nbsp;August 1984) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Its chief [[engineer]] from 1935 to 1959, he served on the RAAF's controlling body, the Air Board, for a record 17 years, and has been credited with infusing operations with new standards of [[airworthiness]]. Commencing his service career as a [[Royal Australian Navy]] cadet during [[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]], Wackett transferred to the Air Force in 1923 while on an engineering course in Britain. He qualified as a [[Aviator|pilot]] before completing his studies and returning to Australia, where he inaugurated [[parachute]] instruction within the RAAF and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft in 1926. The following year, he led a three-month survey flight to [[Papua New Guinea]].

Wackett became the RAAF's senior engineer with his appointment as Director of Technical Services in 1935. A [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] at the outbreak of [[World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], he rose to [[Air Commodore]] by 1942 and assumed the role of Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance. He established the Technical Branch as a separate department of the RAAF in 1948, and was promoted to Air Vice Marshal the same year. Wackett served as Air Member for Technical Services until leaving the military in 1959, having been appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] and [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]. From 1960 to 1968, he was a member of the Australian National Airlines Commission, parent of [[Trans Australia Airlines]]. Generally known as "Wack", or "EC" (to distinguish him from his  elder brother, aircraft designer [[Lawrence Wackett|Lawrence James Wackett]] or "LJ"), his prominent chin and nose also earned him the nickname "[[Punch and Judy|Punch]]".<ref name="High Fliers">Stephens and Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 97&ndash;99</ref> He died in 1984 at the age of 83.

==Early career==
Born in [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], [[Queensland]], Ellis Wackett entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] at [[Jervis Bay]], [[New South Wales]] in 1914, at age 13.<ref name="High Fliers"/> Graduating in 1918, he served as a [[Midshipman]] aboard the [[Royal Navy]] [[battleship]] [[HMS Monarch (1911)|HMS ''Monarch'']] and [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Renown (1916)|HMS ''Renown'']], and later the RAN [[light cruiser]] [[HMAS Brisbane (1915)|HMAS ''Brisbane'']] and battlecruiser [[HMAS Australia (1911)|HMAS ''Australia'']].<ref name="NAA">[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=5219976&I=1&SE=1 Personnel file: Wackett, Ellis Charles] at [http://www.naa.gov.au/index.aspx National Archives of Australia].

Retrieved on 4 August 2009.</ref> He then took a one-year [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] course in [[aeronautics]] at the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College of Science and Technology, London]], before returning to Australia to take up his service as a [[Flying Officer]] with the RAAF.<ref name="Third Brother pp.337-338"/>

Wackett's first role was to establish [[parachute]] instruction within the Air Force. His trip  home from England had been postponed at the last minute to enable him to be trained; he began instructing volunteers in 1926&nbsp;at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Richmond]], New South Wales, and made Australia's first freefall descent from a military aircraft&mdash;an [[Airco DH.9]]&mdash;on 26&nbsp;May. The [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Group Captain]] [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], himself made a successful jump on 5&nbsp;August, to set "a good example" prior to making the wearing of parachutes compulsory for all aircrew. On 21&nbsp;August, Wackett piloted the DH.9&nbsp;from which Flying Officer [[Frederick Scherger]] made the first public display of parachuting in Australia, at [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref name="Third Brother pp.337-338"/>

By August 1927, Wackett had been promoted [[Flight Lieutenant]] and given command of the Papuan Survey Flight formed at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Laverton]], Victoria. Consisting of two [[Supermarine Seagull (1921)|Supermarine Seagull III]] single-engined [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[biplane]]s and six aircrew, the flight was to examine and photograph the [[Territory of Papua|Papuan]] and [[New Guinea]]n coasts as far north as [[Aitape]] and, if possible, [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. Stripped of all equipment considered non-essential&mdash;including [[radio]] sets&mdash;to increase range, the aircraft departed on 27&nbsp;September and journeyed some {{convert|17700|km|mi}}, covering almost {{convert|130000|km2|mi2}} of country and taking 350&nbsp;photos. Wackett's machine (serial A9-5) returned to [[Melbourne]] on 26&nbsp;December and the other (A9<U+2013>6) on 19&nbsp;January 1928.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 412<U+2013>413</ref> Inclement weather prevented the expedition from reaching Bougainville, and thick jungle cover limited the usefulness of its photographic record. Nevertheless, the Air Force learned valuable lessons concerning the Seagull's capabilities in a potential wartime role, as it was found to be unsuited to operations in the tropics.<ref>Wilson, [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/unsworks:3183/SOURCE02?view=true ''The Eagle and the Albatross'', pp. 26&ndash;27]</ref>

On 14&nbsp;August 1928, Wackett married Doreen Dove; the couple would have two sons and a daughter.<ref name="Who's Who in Australia">Legge, ''Who's Who in Australia 1977'', p. 1058</ref> In 1933, Wackett was posted to England to attend [[RAF Staff College, Andover]].<ref name="Who's Who in Australia"/> Returning to Australia, he was promoted [[Squadron Leader]] and became Director of Technical Services, an organisation within the RAAF's Supply Branch, in May 1935; the appointment made Wackett the Air Force's senior engineer.<ref name="High Fliers"/><ref name="Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942 p.70">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 70]</ref> The same year, he took charge of the Resources Committee for Electrical Equipment, Scientific and Optical Instruments, one of a number of subcommittees on the federal government's Defence Resources Board set up to investigate and report on the readiness of Australian industry to provide munitions for defence in the event of international conflict.<ref>Mellor, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/34/chapters/02.pdf ''The Role of Science and Industry'', p. 28]</ref>

==World War II==
[[File:An004232JonesECWackettBurnett1941.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|right|250px|alt=A dozen men behind a large table, half of whom are in military uniform and half in civilian clothes, seven standing and five seated|Group Captain Wackett, Director of Technical Services (standing, far left), with members of the RAAF Flying Personnel Medical Research Committee, including Group Captain [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], Director of Training (seated, second left), and Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]], Chief of the Air Staff (seated, far right), c. 1941]]
Ranked [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] at the outbreak of World War II, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges in his role as Director of Technical Services.  Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British-built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo.<ref name="Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942 p.70"/> His Directorate made whatever use it could of civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment.<ref name="Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942 p.94">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 94]</ref> He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's technical services organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] (CAC).<ref name="High Fliers"/> By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary Group Captain, and joined the Flying Personnel Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the flying, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon such factors as aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, [[motion sickness]], [[decompression sickness|decompression]] and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref>Walker, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/38/chapters/28.pdf ''Medical Services of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force'', p.325]</ref> 

Wackett was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1941 [[New Years Honours]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35029|supp=yes|startpage=11|date=1 January 1941|accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref> In June, he became the RAAF's representative on the federal Aircraft Advisory Committee, set up to assist the Director-General of Aircraft Production. As well as members from governmental and scientific bodies, the committee included delegates from aircraft manufacturers such as [[de Havilland Australia]] and CAC, with Lawrence Wackett acting as Chief Technical Advisor.<ref>Mellor, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/34/chapters/18.pdf ''The Role of Science and Industry'', p. 388]</ref> Later that year, the two brothers joined various academics on the newly formed Australian Council for Aeronautics, established by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]] to advise government, educational and scientific organisations on technical developments in the aircraft industry.<ref>Mellor, ''The Role of Science and Industry'', p. 405</ref> 

Raised to [[Air Commodore]], Wackett was appointed Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance (AME) on 4&nbsp;June 1942.<ref name="Going Solo p.450">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 450</ref> As AME, he sat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, which consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 112</ref> His new position had been created to replace that of the Director-General of Supply and Production, a civilian post.<ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/24.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 479]</ref> Wackett would serve on the Air Board for the next seventeen years, a record tenure for the RAAF, his experience and intellect making him, in the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "singularly adept at bringing a committee around to his point of view".<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 81</ref> During the war, the Air Board oversaw expansion from a complement in 1939 of 246 obsolescent machines such as [[CAC Wirraway]]s, [[Avro Anson]]s and [[Lockheed Hudson]]s, to a strength in 1945 of 5,620 sophisticated aircraft including [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s, [[P-51 Mustang]]s, [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es and [[B-24 Liberator]]s; to support this force, the RAAF had provided all-through training for 18,000 technical staff, and further education for 35,000 more schooled initially outside the service.<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 152&ndash;154, 170&ndash;173</ref>

==Post-war career==

Following the end of the war, Wackett contributed to "Plan&nbsp;D", the blueprint for restructuring the RAAF sponsored by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]]. A major facet of Plan&nbsp;D, adopted in June 1947, was its encouragement of local industry to design and build military trainers and produce more sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. This policy would eventually lead to the [[CAC Winjeel|Winjeel]] basic trainer and Australian co-partnership in production of the [[CAC Sabre]] jet fighter and [[English Electric Canberra|GAF Canberra]] jet bomber.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 188</ref><ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 221&ndash;222</ref> Wackett also supported Air Vice Marshal [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]], the Air Member for Personnel, in fostering apprenticeships as part of the "education revolution" that took place in the RAAF during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Apprentice Training Scheme, designed to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, opened early in 1948 at the Ground Training School in [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Station Wagga]], New South Wales to provide education and technical training for youths aged 15 to 17. By 1952, it had been renamed the RAAF School of Technical Training.<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 185&ndash;189</ref>

Wackett played a key role in establishing technical services as a distinct department within the RAAF, rather than forming part of the Supply Branch as in previous years. Mindful of the increasing responsibility that was being placed on scientific and technical resources in the modern Air Force, he had raised the question of a specialist engineering branch immediately after the war, and in March 1946 gained broad approval for its establishment. After eighteen months of work defining its scope and responsibilities, the Technical Branch was formed under Wackett's leadership on 23&nbsp;September 1948, his goals being to "to support the operational power of the RAAF by providing the most efficient technical organisation possible" and "to increase the effectiveness of air power through technical development". This in turn led to a separate "list" of engineering personnel, as opposed to the earlier Technical List subgroup under the General Duties Branch.<ref name="Going Solo pp.171-173">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 171&ndash;173</ref>  

For flexibility, and to ensure that the flying and engineering branches had a better appreciation of their respective operations, Wackett supported the practice of some general duties officers continuing to perform engineering work, and as many technical officers as possible receiving secondary training as aircrew. He was disappointed, however, by the limits imposed by the Air Board on career advancement for his personnel. While the General Duties Branch in the late 1940s was permitted to maintain thirty-seven officer positions of Group Captain and above, the Technical Branch was only allowed fourteen such slots, though both departments had an almost identical overall strength of just under 400 staff. This anomaly led Wackett to submit a dissenting report on the subject to the Air Board, one of the few occasions a board member exercised his right to such a protest. His new organisation caused some other tensions in the RAAF: new [[airworthiness]] considerations frustrated pilots who found their flying time restricted by the introduction of more rigorous maintenance procedures; supply officers feared being "outshone" by the new status accorded to engineers; and so-called "black handers"&mdash;old-school technical officers who had risen through the ranks&mdash;regarded with disdain the prospect of an influx of "silly young blokes with degrees".<ref name="Going Solo pp.171-173"/>

Wackett had been promoted temporary Air Vice Marshal on 1&nbsp;January 1947; this rank was made substantive following the formation of the Technical Branch.<ref name="Going Solo pp.171-173"/> On 31&nbsp;October 1949, his title was changed from Air Member for Equipment and Maintenance to Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS),<ref name="Going Solo p.450"/> in which capacity he would serve until his retirement from the RAAF in 1959.<ref name="Who's Who in Australia"/> Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1951 [[King's Birthday Honours]],<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=39244|supp=yes|startpage=3096|date=7 June 1951|accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref> Wackett again worked closely with Air Vice Marshal Hewitt, now the Air Member for Supply and Equipment, to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on "life-of-type", whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed, to reduce costs and delivery time.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 182</ref> 

In 1953, Wackett established advanced diploma training for twenty-five airmen annually at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]], the graduates receiving commissions as [[Pilot Officer]]s.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 137</ref> He also began recruiting university-qualified engineers to the Technical Branch, and put in place formal relationships with such bodies as [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]], the Council of Aeronautics (of which he was a member), Aeronautical Research Laboratories, and local aircraft manufacturers de Havilland Australia, [[Government Aircraft Factories]], and CAC. He further initiated RAAF sponsorship of a chair of aeronautics at the [[University of Sydney]].<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 440</ref> Wackett was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1957 New Years Honours.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=40961|supp=yes|startpage=41|date=1 January 1957|accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref> Two years later, his wife Doreen was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for her service as Vice President and, from 1948, President of the RAAF Women's Association.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=41590|supp=yes|startpage=39|date=1 January 1959|accessdate=4 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | date = 1 January 1959 | title = Women Share in New Year Honors Announced Today | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=caoUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=g7IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3642,39061&dq=wackett+raaf | journal = [[The Age]] | accessdate = on 4 September 2009}}</ref>

For his commitment to the concept of airworthiness, as an attitude to quality and professionalism that went beyond simply whether aircraft were fit to fly or not, Wackett has been described as one of the "outstanding officers of the post-war era".<ref name="Going Solo pp.171-173"/>  The establishment of a dedicated Technical Branch, which he founded in 1948, was a key factor in the Air Force developing the ability to successfully manage the maintenance and upgrade of such highly sophisticated aircraft as the [[General Dynamics F-111]].<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 196, 290</ref> Wackett's seventeen-year tenure on the Air Board, which was dissolved in 1976, remained the longest of any officer in the RAAF.<ref name="High Fliers"/><ref>Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 188</ref> He was followed by a series of leaders of the Technical Branch (renamed Engineering Branch in 1966) who shared his vision, including Air Vice Marshals [[Ernie Hey]] (1960&ndash;1972) and [[James Rowland (RAAF officer)|James Rowland]] (1972&ndash;75).<ref name="Going Solo pp.178-179">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 178&ndash;179</ref> Wackett was among those considered as possible successors to [[Air Marshal]] George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) when the latter was retired in 1952, however Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]]' federal government chose an RAF officer for the role, Air Marshal [[Donald Hardman|Sir Donald Hardman]].<ref name="High Fliers"/><ref name="The Commanders">Rayner, ''The Commanders'', p. 314</ref> In any case, Air Force regulations at that time stipulated that appointees had to belong to the RAAF's General Duties (Aircrew) Branch.

The following year, the requirement for CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.<ref name="Stephens pp.296-297">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 296&ndash;297</ref>
