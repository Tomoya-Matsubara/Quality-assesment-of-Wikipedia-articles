The '''''Almirante Latorre'' class''' was originally a two-ship [[ship class|group]] of [[super-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s (Spanish: ''acorazados'') built by the British [[Armstrong Whitworth]] for the [[Chilean Navy]]. Only one, {{Ship|Chilean battleship|Almirante Latorre||2}}, was finished as a battleship; the other, ''Almirante Cochrane'', was converted to an [[aircraft carrier]]. Both were sold to the [[Royal Navy]] prior to completion, being renamed ''Canada'' and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} in British service.

At the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, Chile instigated or was drawn into numerous naval arms races with Argentina. When Argentina responded to Brazil's order for two [[dreadnought]]s with two of its own, Chile felt that it also needed to respond. Despite a strong push from American companies, an order for two dreadnoughts was placed with the British, probably due to Chile's traditionally strong ties with the United Kingdom. The keels for both ships [[keel laying|were laid]], but prior to completion, ''Almirante Latorre'' and ''Almirante Cochrane'' were purchased by the British [[Royal Navy]] for use in the [[World War I|First World War]].

''Almirante Latorre'', which was much more advanced than her [[sister ship|sister]], was commissioned into British service as ''Canada'' in October 1915. She patrolled the [[North Sea]] for most of the war, and saw action in the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Post-war, she was put into reserve before being sold back to Chile as ''Almirante Latorre'' in 1920. The battleship was the instigator of the [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931|1931 naval mutiny]], and was kept on patrol during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. She was scrapped only in 1959. After ''Almirante Cochrane'' was purchased by the British, construction on the ship was halted until 1917, when it was decided to convert her into an [[aircraft carrier]]. After numerous delays, she was commissioned into the Royal Navy in February 1924. She served in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] and on the [[China Station]] in the inter-war period, and operated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during the Second World War before being sunk during [[Operation Pedestal]].

== Background ==
=== Argentine<U+2013>Chilean boundary dispute ===
{{seealso|Beagle conflict}}
The genesis of the ''Almirante Latorre'' class was in the conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to [[Patagonia]], which went all the way back to the 1840s. In 1872 and again in 1878, Chilean warships seized merchant ships operating in the disputed area which had been given license to do so by Argentina. An Argentine warship did the same to an American ship in 1877. These actions nearly led to war in November 1878, when Argentina dispatched a squadron of warships to the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]]. Chile responded with the same, and war was only avoided by a hastily-signed treaty. Both countries were distracted in the next few years by Argentina's internal military operations against natives and Chile's [[War of the Pacific]] (''Guerra del Pac<U+00ED>fico'') against Bolivia and Peru, but by 1890 a full-fledged naval arms race was underway between the two.<ref>Schenia, ''Naval History'', 45&ndash;46.</ref><ref>Garrent, "Beagle Channel," 85&ndash;87.</ref>

Both sides began ordering warships from the United Kingdom. Chile designated [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]3,129,500 in 1887 to add to its fleet, which was centered around two 1870s [[central battery ship|central battery]] [[ironclad warship|ironclads]], {{Ship|Chilean battleship|Almirante Cochrane|1874|2}} and {{Ship|Chilean battleship|Blanco Encalada|1875|2}}, and a [[protected cruiser]] (''crucero protegido''). A battleship, {{Ship|Chilean battleship|Capit<U+00E1>n Prat||2}}, two protected cruisers, and two [[torpedo boat]]s were ordered, and their [[keel laying|keels were laid]] in 1890. Argentina responded soon after with an order for two battleships, {{Ship|ARA|Independencia|1891|2}} and {{Ship|ARA|Libertad|1890|2}}. The race continued through the 1890s, even after the [[Chilean Civil War|1891 civil war]]. The two countries alternated cruiser orders: Argentina ordered two in 1890&ndash;91, Chile one in 1892, Argentina purchased an incomplete British cruiser in 1893, and Chile ordered another in 1895. Each of these marked a small increase in capabilities from the ship previous. The Argentines then upped the ante by buying an [[armored cruiser]] (''crucero acorazado''), {{Ship|ARA|Garibaldi||2}}, from Italy in July 1895. Chile was forced to respond by ordering its own armored cruiser, {{Ship|Chilean cruiser|O'Higgins||2}}, and six torpedo boats; Argentina quickly ordered another cruiser from Italy and later bought two more.<ref>Schenia, ''Naval History'', 45&ndash;49, 297&ndash;298, 347.</ref>

The race abated somewhat after a boundary dispute in the [[Puna de Atacama]] region was successfully mediated by the [[United States Ambassador to Argentina|American ambassador to Argentina]] [[William Paine Lord]] in 1899, but more ships were ordered by Argentina and Chile in 1901. Argentina ordered two [[Kasuga class cruiser|''Rivadavia''-class]] armored cruisers from Italy, and Chile replied with orders for two [[Swiftsure class battleship|''Constituci<U+00F3>n''-class]] [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships. Argentina continued by signing letters of intent with [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships.<ref>Schenia, ''Naval History'', 49&ndash;50.</ref>

The growing dispute concerned the British, who had extensive commercial interests in the area, and through their minister to Chile, they mediated negotiations between the two countries. These [[Treaty of Arbitration Between Chile and Argentina of 1902|were successfully concluded]] on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other an eighteen-month advance notice. The United Kingdom purchased the two Chilean battleships, while Japan took over the order for the two Argentine armored cruisers; the two Argentine battleships were never ordered. Two Argentine cruisers and Chile's ''Capit<U+00E1>n Prat'' were demilitarized.<ref>Schenia, ''Naval History'', 49&ndash;52.</ref>

=== Dreadnought arms race ===
[[File:E Minas Geraes 1910 altered.jpg|260px|thumb|Brazil's order for two dreadnoughts (''[[Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes|Minas Geraes]] pictured'') sparked a naval arms race between themselves, Argentina, and Chile]]
By 1904, Brazil<U+2014>the largest country in South America in both size and population<U+2014>began to seriously consider upgrading its navy, which had fallen to third in total tonnage.<ref name=Livermore32>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32.</ref> [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)#Early Twentieth Century|Soaring demand]] for coffee and [[rubber boom|rubber]] brought the Brazilian economy an influx of revenue,<ref name=Sondhaus216>Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare'', 216.</ref><ref name=Conways403>Schenia, "Brazil," 403.</ref> which paid for a large naval building plan. The centerpiece of the new navy would be two {{Sclass|Minas Geraes|battleship|4}} [[dreadnought]]s built by the United Kingdom.<ref name=Livermore32/> The ordering of these powerful ships, designed to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the time, <ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany may buy English warships]," ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 August 1908, C8.</ref> shocked Argentina and Chile,<ref>Schenia, "Argentina," 400.</ref> causing them to cancel the 1902 armament-limiting pact with immediate effect. Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a [[cablegram]] to his [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32&ndash;33.</ref>

Attempts from outside countries and Argentina&mdash;by offering to purchase one of the two dreadnoughts&mdash;to avert a full-scale naval arms race were made. Brazil's refusal of Argentina's offer, combined with further tensions over the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata|River Plate]] (''R<U+00ED>o de la Plata'', literally "Silver River") area and inflammatory newspaper editorials favoring dreadnoughts, caused Argentina to go ahead with a massive naval building plan. After a [[Rivadavia class battleship#Design|drawn-out bidding process]] between fifteen shipyards from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, Argentina ordered two {{Sclass|Rivadavia|battleship|4}} dreadnoughts with an option for a third from the United States. They also ordered twelve destroyers from three nations in Europe. With its major rival acquiring so many modern vessels,{{#tag:ref|By 1911, the disparity between the navies of Chile, Argentina, and Brazil had grown; Brazil had nearly four times the tonnage of Chile, while Argentina had nearly three and a half times as much.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 41.</ref>|group=N}} Chile was forced to respond, though this was delayed by a financial [[depression (economics)|depression]] brought on by a drastic fall in the [[nitrate]] market and a major earthquake in 1907 and 1908, respectively.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 33&ndash;41.</ref>

== Bidding, construction, and sale to the British ==
On 6 July 1910, the [[National Congress of Chile]] passed a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] allocating <U+00A3>400,000 [[pounds sterling]] to the navy for two {{convert|28000|LT|t|0|lk=on|adj=on}} [[battleship]]s&mdash;which would eventually be named ''Almirante Latorre'' and [[HMS Eagle (1918)|''Almirante Cochrane'']]{{#tag:ref|'''Almirante Latorre'' was originally named ''Valpara<U+00ED>so'', after the [[Valpara<U+00ED>so|Chilean city]], but was renamed to ''Libertad'', Spanish for "freedom."<ref name=Appendix7/> After the death of the famed admiral [[Juan Jos<U+00E9> Latorre]], she was renamed ''Almirante Latorre'' in July 1912.<ref name=Armada/> Sources are not specific as to when the ship was renamed for the first time.|group=N}}&mdash;six [[destroyer]]s, and two [[submarine]]s.<ref name=Armada>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20080608084301/http://www.armada.cl/site/unidades_navales/336.htm Acorazado Almirante Latorre]," Armada de Chile, archived 8 June 2008.</ref> As part of a bid to receive the contract for the battleships, the United States sent [[Henry Prather Fletcher]], who had previous success implementing President [[William Howard Taft]]'s "[[Dollar Diplomacy]]" policy in Chine, to be the new [[United States Ambassador to Chile|minister to Chile]] in September 1910.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 41.</ref> However, he was met with immediate disapproval, something he attributed to lingering sentiment from the  1891 [[Baltimore Crisis|''Baltimore'' Crisis]]: "My advances in the matter have not been met with frankness or encouragement and I feel a spirit of covert opposition. Under a very polite and courteous exterior there still exists a feeling of soreness towards us."<ref>Quoted in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 41.</ref> The [[military attach<U+00E9>|naval attach<U+00E9>]] in the embassy opined that the contracts would be given to the British barring anything short of a revolution, and indeed the bidding process called for battleships that had specifications corresponding very near to the armament and armor mounted on recent British warships. An extension was requested by Fletcher and granted so that shipbuilding firms could tailor proposals to these requirements.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 41.</ref>

[[File:USS Delaware BB-28.jpg|thumb|right|The United States' {{USS|Delaware|BB-28|2}} was sent to Brazil and Chile in early 1911 as part of a concentrated effort to obtain the battleship contracts for American shipyards]]
During this time, Germany announced plans to send the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} on a South American cruise. As the ship was "widely advertised as the fastest and most powerful warship then afloat," the United States and United Kingdom felt it might give German companies an advantage in potential armament contracts, so they sent ships of their own. The former sent the new battleship {{USS|Delaware|BB-28|2}}, along with the body of the recently-deceased Chilean minister to the United States, on a ten-week excursion to Brazil and Chile, while the British sent an armored cruiser squadron. Orders to ''Delaware''{{'}}s captain instructed him to give the Chileans full access of the vessel&mdash;the only exception being that he should not give full particulars of the new [[fire-control system]].<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 41&ndash;42.</ref>&mdash;in an attempt by the Navy Department "to aid the shipbuilding interests of the country [United States] to make contracts for the building of men-of-war for foreign countries."<ref>Quoted in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 42.</ref> The visit of ''Delaware'' did not induce the Chileans to order from an American shipyard, even with a standing offer for a $25&nbsp;million loan. Instead, with a loan from the [[Rothschild family|Rothchilds]], Chile awarded one battleship from the United Kingdom's [[Armstrong Whitworth]] on 25 July 1911; the other contract would be given when the country could fund it. The United States still hoped for a time that Chile would order American [[14"/50 caliber gun|14-inch/50 caliber]] guns for the battleship's [[main battery]] armament, but the only orders came for [[coastal artillery]]. The second dreadnought was awarded to Armstrong in June 1912.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 42&ndash;43.</ref> Six [[Almirante Lynch class destroyer (1912)|''Almirante Lynch''-class destroyers]] were ordered in 1911 from [[J.

The first dreadnought was officially ordered on 2 November 1911 and [[keel laying|laid down]] less than a month later on 27 November,<ref name=Appendix7>Schenia, ''Naval History'', 322.</ref><ref name=Conways>Schenia, "Chile," 408.</ref> becoming the largest ship built by Armstrong at the time.<ref>Gill, "Professional Notes," 493.</ref> The other was ordered on 29 July 1912 and laid down on 22 January 1913.<ref name=Appendix7/> The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' reported on 2 November 1913 that [[Greece]] had reached an accord to purchase the first battleship during a [[war scare]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]],<ref>"Turkey Threatened with Another War," ''[[New York Tribune]]'', 2 November 1913, 12.</ref> but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.<ref name=Livermore45>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45.</ref><ref>Kaldis, "Background for Conflict," D1135.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The nationalistic sentiments that exacerbated the naval arms race had given way to a slowing economy and growing public opinion that supported investing inside the country.<ref name=Livermore45/> The United States' [[United States Ambassador to Chile|Minister to Chile]], [[Henry Prather Fletcher]], commented to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Jennings Bryan]]: "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps they are much more in need of money than of battleships."<ref>Quoted in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45.</ref>|group=N}}

''Almirante Latorre'', the first, was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 November 1913,<ref name=Burt240>Burt, ''British Battleships'', 240.</ref><ref>Gill, "Professional Notes," 193.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Schenia gives 17 November as the launching date.<ref name=Appendix7/>|group=N}} in an elaborate ceremony that was attended by various dignitaries and presided over by Chile's ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Agust<U+00ED>n Edwards Mac Clure]]. The battleship was [[ship christening|christened]] by the ambassador's wife, Olga Budge de Edwards.<ref name=Armada/> After the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in Europe, ''Almirante Latorre'' was formally purchased by the United Kingdom on 9 September 1914;<ref name=Appendix7/><ref name=Burt240/><ref name=ConwaysGB>Preston, "Great Britain," 38.</ref><ref>"British Navy Gains," ''The New York Times'', 7 December 1918, 14.</ref> she was not forcibly seized like the Ottoman [[HMS Erin (1913)|''Reshadieh'']] and [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|''Sultan Osman I'']], two other ships being built for a foreign navy, because of Chile's "friendly neutral" status with the United Kingdom.<ref name=ConwaysGB/> Work on the other ship, ''Almirante Cochrane'', was halted after the outbreak of war. The British purchased her on 28 February 1918 to be converted to an [[aircraft carrier]], as the partially-completed ship was the only large and fast hull capable of fulfilling being fully flush-decked for aircraft landings. Low priority and [[industrial action|quarrels with shipyard workers]] slowed completion of the ship.<ref name=Preston70>Preston, "Great Britain," 70.</ref>

== Service histories ==
''Almirante Latorre'' was renamed HMS ''Canada'' and slightly modified for British service.<ref name=Burt240>Burt, ''British Battleships'', 240.</ref> The ship completed [[fitting-out]] on 20 September 1915,<ref name=Appendix7/><ref name=ConwaysGB/> and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[Royal Navy]] on 15 October. She initially served with the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Battle Squadron]] of the [[Grand Fleet]], and saw action in the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May&ndash;1 June 1916. She fired 42 rounds from her 14-inch guns and 109 6-inch shells during the battle, and suffered no hits or casualties. ''Canada'' was transferred to the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]] on 12 June 1916, received further modifications in 1917&ndash;18, and was put into reserve in March 1919.<ref name=Burt240/>

[[File:Inflexible LOC det 4a16122.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Inflexible|1907|2}} would have been one of two {{Sclass|Invincible|battlecruiser|1}}s sold to Chile, but monetary considerations and significant opposition prevented their purchase]]
After the end of the war in Europe, Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered many of its surplus warships. This action worried the nations of South America, who feared that a Chilean attempt to regain the title of "the first naval power in South America"<ref>Graser Schornstheimer, "Chile as a Naval Power," ''The New York Times'', 22 August 1920, X10.</ref> would destabilize the region and start another naval arms race.<ref name="Livermore48">Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 48.</ref> Along with ''Canada'', Chile asked for ''Almirante Cochrane'' but would not purchase the ship unless she was reconstructed into the original battleship configuration. The British seriously considered the offer, going so far as to halt work on the incomplete ship in October 1919. The increased cost of converting her back, <U+00A3>2.5&nbsp;million with only a <U+00A3>1.5&nbsp;million profit from a sale, and a perceived need to test the aircraft carrier concept, especially whether [[wikt:island|island]]s were viable, caused the British to keep and complete the ship as {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}}.<ref name=Preston70>Preston, "Great Britain," 70.</ref><ref>Brown, "HMS ''Eagle''," 251.</ref>

In April 1920, Chile only bought ''Canada'' and four destroyers, all of which had been ordered by Chile prior to the war's outbreak and requisitioned by the British for the war.<ref name="Livermore48"/> Planned replacements for ''Almirante Cochrane'' included the two remaining {{Sclass|Invincible|battlecruiser|1}}s, but when the secret negotiations to acquire them were leaked to the press, a major uproar erupted. The most visible dissension came from a block of officers in the navy, who publicly opposed any possible purchase and instead promoted a "New Navy" which would acquire submarines and airplane. They argued that these weapons would cost less and give the country, and its lengthy coastline, better protection from external threats. The ships were not bought for reasons of cost, but neither were the airplanes its supporters had been hoping for.<ref>Somervell, "Naval Affairs," 393<U+2013>394.</ref>

=== ''Almirante Latorre''/''Canada'' in Chilean service ===
''Canada'' was renamed ''Almirante Latorre'' once again and formally handed over to the Chilean government on 27 November 1920.<ref name=Burt240/> She departed [[Plymouth]] the same day with two of the destroyers,<ref>"Chile's War Fleet Sails," ''The New York Times'', 28 November 1920, 12.</ref> and they arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921, where they were welcomed by Chile's president, [[Arturo Alessandri]]. ''Almirante Latorre'' was made the [[flagship]] of the navy.<ref name=Armada/> The dreadnought was frequently utilized by Chilean President [[Arturo Alessandri]] for various functions, including as transport to Vallenar after a [[1922 Vallenar earthquake|1922 earthquake]],<ref name=Armada/><ref>"More Earthquakes Hit Northern Chile," ''The New York Times'', 16 November 1922, 3.</ref> and to [[Talcahuano]] for the grand opening of a new naval drydock in 1924.<ref name=Armada/> In 1925, with the fall of the [[Government Junta of Chile (1925)|January Junta]], the ship hosted Alessandri after his return from exile. In September, the last month of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward]], [[Prince of Wales]], onboard the battleship.<ref>Somervell, "Naval Affairs," 393&ndash;394.</ref>

''Almirante Latorre'' was sent to the United Kingdom for a modernization at the [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] in 1929. It lasted for quite some time; she left for Valpara<U+00ED>so nearly two years later, on 5 March 1931, and arrived on 12 April.<ref name=Whitley33>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II'', 33.</ref> Soon after her arrival, ''Almirante Latorre'' was the instigator of [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931|a major mutiny]] spawned by the [[Great Depression]] and a recent pay cut. The ships surrendered five days after it began when an air strike was mounted by government forces. ''Almirante Latorre'' ended up in the [[Bay of Tongoi]] with {{Ship|Chilean cruiser|Blanca Encalada||2}}.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 112&ndash;114.</ref><ref>Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 76.</ref>

Still in the midst of the depression, ''Almirante Latorre'' was deactivated at Talcahuano in 1933 to lessen government expenditures,<ref>"Chile Lays Up All Battleships in Drastic Economy Measure," ''The New York Times'', 19 January 1933, 7.</ref> and only a caretaker crew was assigned to tend to the [[:wikt:mothballed|mothballed]] ship into the mid-1930s.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 86, 359.</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is not clear when ''Almirante Latorre'' was reactivated.

=== ''Almirante Cochrane''/''Eagle'' in British service ===
[[File:Hms-eagle-1942.jpg|260px|thumb|right|''Eagle'' in the Mediterranean, 1942]]
''Eagle'' was used for trials in throughout 1920. As the concept of aircraft carriers was still very new, the lessons learned were taken and incorporated in a 1921&ndash;23 refit. Her real [[sea trials]] were conducted in September 1923, and she was commissioned on 26 February 1924. The new ship was sent to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in June, and alternated between refits in the United Kingdom (1926, 1929) and the Mediterranean until 1931, when ''Eagle'' was sent to [[:wikt:show the flag|show the flag]] on a South American cruise. Between her major refits in 1931&ndash;32 and 1936, ''Eagle'' was sent to the [[China Station]] before rotating back to the Mediterranean. After 1936, she was sent back tot he Far East, where she was when the Second World War broke out in September 1939. For the seven months, ''Eagle'' was used for anti-raider patrols, but when one of her own aircraft bombs exploded onboard in March 1940, the carrier was forced to sail to Singapore for repairs. Soon after ''Eagle'' was moved to the Mediterranean, where she protected [[convoy]]s until May 1941, when she was sent to [[Gibraltar]]. She spent the next several months in the South Atlantic, on guard against German raiders.<ref>Brown, "HMS ''Eagle''," 251&ndash;265.</ref>

In September, a major fire severely damaged ''Eagle'', so she was sent back to the United Kingdom. The refit lasted from October 1941 to February 1942, and she was quickly sent to reinforce [[Force H]]. She was employed to ferry [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] to Malta in attempts to keep the besieged island under British control. As part of this duty, she was used to cover a convoy in October 1941, where she was sunk in four minutes by four torpedoes from {{Ship|German submarine|U-73|1940|2}}.<ref>Brown, "HMS ''Eagle''," 265&ndash;271.</ref>

:''For specifications of Almirante Cochrane, see {{HMS|Eagle|1918}}''
''Almirante Latorre'' closely compared with the British {{Sclass|Iron Duke|battleship|4}}, the major difference being that the Chilean ship was longer, had less [[forecastle]] but more [[quarterdeck]], and had larger funnels along with an aft mast. The ship was {{convert|28600|t|LT|abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}} [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard]] and {{convert|32120|t|LT|abbr=off|sp=us}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Full or deep load or loaded displacement|full load]]. At {{convert|661|ft|m}} [[length overall|overall]], she was {{convert|39|ft|m}} longer than the ''Iron Duke''s. They had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|92|ft|m}} and a mean [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|29|ft|m}}.<ref name=ConwaysGB/>

The ship's [[main battery]] was composed of ten [[EOC 14 inch /45 naval gun|14-inch/45]] [[caliber#Caliber as unit of measurement|caliber]] guns mounted in five dual turrets. The arrangement was the same as on the ''Iron Duke''s, with two turrets [[superfire|superfiring]] forward and a single turret amidships separated from the aft superfiring pair by superstructure and a mast. They were able to fire a {{convert|1586|lb|kg}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 1507&nbsp;ft/s (764&nbsp;m/s) to a maximum range of {{convert|24400|yd|m}}. The guns were able to depress to {{degree|-5}} and elevate to {{degree|20}}.<ref>Campbell, ''Naval Weapons'', 379.</ref> The secondary battery was originally composed of sixteen [[BL 6 inch Mk XI naval gun|6-inch Mark XI]], two [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] 20 [[Hundredweight|cwt]] [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns, four [[Ordnance QF 3 pounder Vickers|3-pounders]], and four submerged [[British 21 inch torpedo#21 inch Mark II|21-inch torpedo tubes]]. During the 1929 refit in the United Kingdom, four additional anti-aircraft guns were placed in the aft superstructure.<ref name=ConwaysGB/><ref name=Campbell>Campbell, ''Naval Weapons'', 379.</ref>

''Almirante Latorre'' was powered by [[steam turbine]]s manufactured by [[John Brown & Company|Brown&ndash;Curtis]] and [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]], which put out 37,000&nbsp;[[shaft horsepower]], and 21 [[Water-tube boiler#Yarrow|Yarrow boilers]]. Together, these turned four [[propeller]]s which drove the ship through the water at a maximum speed of {{convert|22.75|kn|mph km/h|abbr=off}}. {{convert|3300|t|LT|abbr=off|sp=us}} of coal and {{convert|520|t|LT|abbr=off|sp=us}} of oil could be carried, giving the ship a maximum theoretical range of {{convert|4400|nmi|mi km}} at {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=ConwaysGB/>

The battleship's armor was composed of a {{convert|9|to|4|in|mm|adj=on}} [[belt armor|belt]], {{convert|4.5|to|3|in|mm|adj=on}} [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s, {{convert|10|to|4|in|mm|adj=on}} [[barbette]]s, {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on}} turret faces, {{convert|4|to|3|in|mm|adj=on}} turret roof, {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[conning tower]], and {{convert|4|to|1|in|mm|adj=on}} [[deck armor|decks]].<ref name=ConwaysGB/><ref name=Campbell/>
