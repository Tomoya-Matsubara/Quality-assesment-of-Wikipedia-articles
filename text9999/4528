'''"Play"''' is a song recorded by American entertainer [[Jennifer Lopez]] for her second studio album ''[[J.Lo (album)|J.Lo]]'' (2001). It was released on March 27, 2001, as the album's second official single. The song was written by [[Cory Rooney]], [[Arnthor Birgisson]],[[Anders Bagge]] and [[Christina Millian]], with production from BAG & Arnthor (Birgisson and Bagge). A [[dance-pop]] track, it was noted for its funky vibe, compared to the works of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] by critics. Over an electric guitar and electronic beat, Lopez sings about pleading a [[DJ]] to play her favorite song. "Play" was a commercial success, peaking at number 18 in the United States while charting within the top ten in over ten countries. Most notably, it reached number three in the United Kingdom. Its futuristic-themed music video was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]].

== Background and release ==
After a high-profile title role in the musical biopic ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' (1997), Lopez began developing her own career in music, later being signed to [[Work Records]] by [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref>Mendible, M.

===Music video===
[[File:Lopez Play.png|thumb|left|225px|Lopez (sporting a frizzy wig) backed by male dancers, in the futuristic music video for "Play".]]
The mainly [[computer generated]] music video for "Play" was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Play {{!}} Jennifer Lopez|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/jennifer-lopez/11333/play.jhtml|publisher=MTV. Viacom International Inc.|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref> Set in a futuristic multi-level spaceship, the clip begins with Lopez strutting into the boarding area whilst the other passengers gaze at her in aw. The video then cuts to Lopez, now on the plane, relaxing with a pair of headphones on listening to music. Various shots showing the plane's exterior are inter cut with these scenes of the singer. Lopez is then seen entering a room through sliding doors with a new outfit. The doors lead to a club filled with dancers. Intercut with these scenes are Lopez dancing solo on a platform, later joined by back-up dancers. Towards the music video's conclusion, Lopez asks the DJ (who takes the avatar of an iris) to play her favorite song. Its final shot depicts the plane flying towards the horizon. The music video, much like "Love Don't Cost a Thing", also features [[Cris Judd]] as a back-up dancer, who would later go on to become her second husband months later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kattalia|first=Kathryn|title=Jennifer Lopez dating backup dancer Casper Smart four months after split from Marc Anthony|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/jennifer-lopez-dating-backup-dancer-casper-smart-months-split-marc-anthony-article-1.976866|work=New York Daily News|publisher=Daily News, L.P.|accessdate=February 16, 2013|date=November 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Cadorette|first=Guylaine|title=J.Lo's Marriage Over?|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/brief/1109750/j-lo-s-marriage-over|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013|date=June 10, 2002}}</ref>
