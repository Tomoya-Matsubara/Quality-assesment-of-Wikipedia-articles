'''MG''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sports car]] brand founded in 1924. 

The brand was in continuous use (barring the years of the [[Second World War]]) for 56 years after its inception. Production of predominantly two-seater sports cars was concentrated at a factory in [[Abingdon]], some 10 miles south of [[Oxford]]. During the [[1960s]], the MG badge was used on a sportier version of the [[Austin 1300]] family saloon. In the autumn of [[1980]], however, the Abingdon factory closed and [[MG B]] production ceased.

Between [[1982]] and [[1991]], the MG marque was revived on faster versions of [[Austin Rover|Austin Rover's]] [[Austin Metro|Metro]], [[Austin Maestro|Maestro]] and [[Austin Montego|Montego]] ranges.

After an interval of barely one year, the MG marque was revived again, this time on the [[MG RV8]] - an updated MG B Roadster with a [[Range Rover]] V8 engine, which was produced in low volumes.

The "real" revival came in the summer of [[1995]], when the high volume [[MG F]] two-seater roadster was launched. This was an instant hit with buyers, and sold in volumes which had been unthinkable on affordable two-seaters since the [[1970s]]. 

MG became one half of the [[MG Rover]] group in [[May]] [[2000]], when [[BMW]] sold off the huge [[Rover Group]]. This arranagement saw the return of MG badges on sportier [[Rover (car)|Rover-based]] products, but production ceased in [[April]] [[2005]] when MG Rover went bankrupt.

The assets of MG Rover were bought by [[China|Chinese]] carmaker [[Nanjing Automobile]] in [[July]] [[2005]], and within two years [[MG TF]] production resumed at [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]]. Production of the [[MG 7]] large sports saloon has also started in [[China]], and in [[2008]] the range is set to expand with the arrival of the smaller [[MG 3]] and [[MG 5]] hatchbacks.

MG got its name from "Morris Garages", a dealer of [[Morris (car)|Morris]] cars in [[Oxford]] which began producing its own customized versions to the designs of [[Cecil Kimber]] who had joined the company as its Sales Manager in 1921 and was promoted to General Manager in 1922.<ref name=MGSportsCars/> Kimber remained as General Manager until 1941 when he fell out with Lord Nuffield over procuring wartime work.  Kimber died in 1945 in a freak railway accident.  In 1952, with the BMC merger, long-time service manager John Thornley took over as General Manager, guiding the company through its best years until his retirement in 1969.  

MG is best known for two-seat open sports cars, but MG also produced [[Sedan|saloons]] and [[coup<U+00E9>]]s.  More recently, the brand has also been used to designate sportier versions of other models belonging to the parent company.

Following the collapse of the MG Rover group, who had owned the marque since purchasing it in 2000 from [[BMW]], MG was bought by the [[Nanjing Automobile Group]] in 2005. Under its new Chinese owners, the brand stands for something new in China, as MG general manager Zhang Xin said: "We want Chinese consumers to know this brand as 'Modern Gentleman'. To see that this brand represents grace and style." <ref>[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph.co.uk]]: [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/18/wrover18.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/06/18/ixnews.html  ''As Longbridge stands empty, the MG Rover jigsaw takes shape 6,000 miles away'']. Issued 2006/06/18; retrieved 2006/07/01.</ref> In Europe it still stands for "Morris Garages".

==History==

There is some debate over when MG started. The company itself stated it to be 1924{{Fact|date=June 2007}}, although the first cars bore both Morris and MG badges and a reference to MG with the octagon badge appears in an Oxford newspaper from November 1923.<ref name=MGSportsCars>{{cite book |last=Green |first=Malcolm |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MG Sports Cars |year=1997 |publisher=CLB |location=Godalming, UK |id=ISBN 1-85833-606-6}}</ref> Others dispute this and believe that MG only properly began trading in 1925.

The first cars which were rebodied Morris models using coachwork from [[Carbodies]] of [[Coventry]] and were built in premises in Alfred Lane, Oxford but demand soon caused a move to larger premises in Bainton Road in September 1925 sharing space with the Morris radiator works. Continuing expansion meant another move in 1927 to a separate factory in Edmund Road, [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]], Oxford,<ref name=MGSportsCars/> near the main Morris factory and for the first time it was possible to include a production line. In 1928 the company had become large enough to warrant an identity separate from the original Morris Garages and the M.G. Car Company Limited was established in March of that year<ref name=MGSportsCars/> and in October for the first time a stand was taken at the [[London Motor Show]]. Space again soon ran out and a search for a permanent home led to the lease of part an old leather factory in [[Abingdon, England|Abingdon]], [[Oxfordshire]] in 1929,<ref name=MGSportsCars/> gradually taking over more space until production ended there in 1980.  

Originally owned personally by William Morris, the company was sold to Morris Motors (itself part of the [[Nuffield Organisation]]) in 1935; a change that was to have serious consequences for the company, particularly its motor-sport activities. MG was absorbed into the [[British Motor Corporation]] in 1952, and latterly [[British Leyland]] (BL) in 1968. Under BMC, several MG models were no more than [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] versions of other marques, with the main exception being the small MG sports cars.

Amidst a mix of economic, internal and external politics, the Abingdon factory was shut down as part of the ruthless programme of cutbacks necessary to turn BL around after the turbulent times of the 1970s.  Though many plants were closed, none created such an uproar among workers, dealers, clubs and customers as this closing did.  Years later, Sir Michael Edwardes expressed regret about his decision. Later forms of MGs built by BL's [[Austin Rover Group]] were often [[badge engineering|badge-engineered]] Austins, and were made at the [[Longbridge]] plant. As of 2003, the site of the former Abingdon factory was host to [[McDonalds]] and the [[Thames Valley Police]] with only the former office block still standing.  The headquarters of the MG Car Club is situated next door.

After BL became the [[Rover Group]] in 1986, ownership of ''MG'' passed to [[British Aerospace]] in 1988 and then in 1994 to [[BMW]]. BMW sold the business in 2000 and MG became part of the [[MG Rover Group]] based in Longbridge, [[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]]. The practice of selling unique MG sports cars alongside badge-engineered models (by now Rovers) continued. The Group went into receivership in 2005 and car production was suspended on [[7 April]] [[2005]].

On [[22 July]] [[2005]], the [[Nanjing Automobile Group]] purchased the rights to the MG name and the assets of the MG Rover Group for <U+00A3>53 million.

In 2006, it was reported that [[Project Kimber]] led by David James had entered talks with Nanjing to buy the MG brand in order to produce a range of sports cars based on the discontinued [[Smart Roadster]] design by [[DaimlerChrysler]]. No agreement was reached and it was later announced that the re-launched Smart Roadster would bear the [[AC Cars|AC]] name.

=== Revival ===

Nanjing restarted production of the MG TF and ZT ranges in early 2007. The TF is being built at [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]], while the ZT (now the '''MG 7''') is being assembled in [[China]].

On [[11 July]] [[2006]] [[Nanjing Automobile Group|Nanjing]] announced that production will continue on the TF sports coup<U+00E9><ref>[http://www.ardmoredevelopment.com/MGReleaseFinal.pdf Ardmore, OK, Chamber of Commerce Press Release]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/cars/news/articles/2007/06/10/mg_car_line_reborn_with_a_made_in_china_label/ MG car line reborn with a made-in-China label]</ref> . A new plant will be built in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma]] to build the next-generation TF, accounting for roughly 60% of TF output worldwide. A new development center will also be opened in the [[United States]], located at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. The Longbridge plant in the UK will continue to build TFs as well, and a third plant in Pukou, at [[Jiangsu Province]] in [[China]], will produce the ZT and ZR. According to [[Nanjing Automobile Group|Nanjing]], MGs will go on sale in the [[United States]] in the early summer of 2008.

The MG range will be relaunched in Britain at the beginning of [[2008]], with the TF being identical to the original model. The new MG 3, MG 5 and MG 7 ranges will be updated versions of the previous MG ZR, MG ZS and MG ZT ranges. Nanjing plans to revive the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] badge (discontinued at the end of the [[1980s]]) on some cheaper cars over the next few years, although it has not been confirmed whether these new Austins will be based on the current range or on the next generation range.

NAC are in talks with SAIC about the merger, with their cars, MG 7 (NAC) and Roewe 750 (SAIC), to share mechanical features to it and worldwide exports. They are also in talks about the Longbridge factory. This talks are supported by the Chinese government. Reports say that SAIC visited the NAC's MG factory in Pukou and looking at NAC's assets. The merger is set to be completed by [[1 October]] [[2007]]. {{Fact|date=September 2007}}

==Car models==
The earliest model, the 1924 '''[[MG 14/28]]''' consisted of a new sporting body on a [[Morris Oxford]] chassis.<ref name=MGSportsCars/> This car model continued through several versions following the updates to the Morris.  The first car which can be described as a new MG, rather than a modified Morris was the '''18/80''' of 1928 which had a purpose designed chassis and the first appearance of the traditional vertical MG grille. A smaller car was launched in 1929 with the first of a long line of Midgets starting with the '''[[MG M|M-Type]]''' based on a 1928 [[Morris Minor (1928)|Morris Minor]] chassis.  MG established a name for itself in the early days of the sport of international automobile racing.  Beginning before and continuing after [[World War II]], MG produced a line of cars known as the T-Series Midgets which, post-war, were exported worldwide, achieving better than expected success. These included the '''[[MG T#TC|MG TC]]''', '''[[MG T#TD|MG TD]]''', and '''[[MG T#TF|MG TF]]''', all of which were based on the pre-war [[MG T#TB|MG TB]], with various degrees of updating. 

MG departed from its earlier line of '''Y-Type''' saloons and pre-war designs and released the '''[[MG A|MGA]]''' in 1955.  The '''[[MG B|MGB]]''' was released in 1962 to satisfy demand for a more modern and comfortable sports car.  In 1965 the fixed head coup<U+00E9> (FHC) followed: the '''[[MG B#GT|MGB GT]]'''.  With continual updates, mostly to comply with increasingly stringent United States emissions and safety standards, the MGB was produced until 1980.  Between 1967 and 1969 a short-lived model called the '''[[MG B#MGC|MGC]]''' was released. The MGC was based on the MGB body, but with a larger (and, unfortunately, heavier) six-cylinder engine, and somewhat worse handling.  MG also began producing the '''[[MG Midget]]''' in 1961.  The Midget was a re-badged and slightly restyled second-generation [[Austin-Healey Sprite]].  To the dismay of many enthusiasts, the 1974 MGB was the last model made with chrome bumpers due to new United States safety regulations; the 1974<U+00BD> bore thick black rubber bumpers that some claimed ruined the marque MGB.  As with the MGB, the Midget design was frequently modified until the Abingdon factory closed in [[October]] [[1980]] and the last of the range was made. The badge was also applied to versions of BMC saloons including the [[BMC ADO16]], which was also available as a [[Riley (motorcar)|Riley]], but with the MG pitched as slightly more "sporty".

The marque lived on after 1980 as [[British Leyland]] (later [[Austin Rover Group]]), the then-owner, continued to place the MG badge on a number of [[Austin (car)|Austin]] saloons including the [[Austin Metro|Metro]], [[Austin Maestro|Maestro]], and [[Austin Montego|Montego]]. In New Zealand, the MG badge even appeared on the late 1980s Montego estate, called the MG 2.0 Si Wagon. There was a brief competitive history with a mid-engined, six-cylinder version of the Metro. The '''MG Metro''' finished production in 1990 on the launch of a Rover-only model. The '''MG Maestro''' and '''MG Montego''' remained on sale until 1991, when production of these models was pruned back in order for Rover to concentrate on the more viable [[Rover 200|200 Series]] and [[Rover 400|400 Series]].

The [[Rover Group]] revived the two-seater with the [[MG B#RV8|MG RV8]] in 1992. The all-new [[MG F|MGF]] went on sale in 1995, becoming the first mass-produced "real" MG sports car since the MGB ceased production in 1980.

In [[May]] [[2000]], [[BMW]] sold off the Rover group after a six-year ownership and its new owners were the '''Phoenix Consortium'''. The [[Land Rover]] and [[Mini]] marques were not included in the deal, and the new-look group included just the '''MG''' and '''Rover''' models. The MG range was expanded in the summer of 2001 with the introduction of three Rover-based sports models. The [[MG ZR]] was based on the [[Rover 25]], the [[MG ZS]] on the [[Rover 45]], and the [[MG ZT|MG ZT/ZT-T]] on the [[Rover 75]].

The MG Rover Group purchased [[Qvale]], which had taken over development of the [[De Tomaso]] Bigua. This car, renamed the Qvale Mangusta and already approved for sale in the U.S., formed the basis of the [[MG XPower SV]], an "extreme" V8-engined sports car. It was revealed in 2002 and went on sale in 2004.

==Motor Sport==
From its earliest days MGs have been used in competition and from the early 1930s a series of dedicated racing cars such as the 1931 C-Type and 1934 Q-type were made and sold to enthusiasts who received considerable company assistance. This stopped in 1935 when MG was formally merged with Morris Motors and the Competition Department closed down. A series of experimental cars had also been made allowing Captain George Eyston to take several world speed records.  In spite of the formal racing ban, speed record attempts continued with Goldie Gardner exceeding 200&nbsp;mph in the 1100&nbsp;cc EX135 in 1939.

After World War II record braking attempts restarted with 500&nbsp;cc and 750&nbsp;cc records being taken in the late 1940s. A decision was also taken to return to racing and a team of MGAs was entered in the tragedy-laden 1955 [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hour]] race, the best car achieving 12th place
 
In 2001 MG re-launched their motor sport campaign to cover the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] ([[MG-Lola EX257]]), [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC) ([[MG ZS]]), British and [[World Rally Championship]]s and MG Independent British Rally Championship ([[MG ZR]]).  The Le Mans team failed to win the endurance race in 2001 and 2002 and quit in 2003. MG Sport+Racing raced in the British Touring Car Championships with the MG ZS between 2001-2003 as a factory team. In 2004 WSR raced the MG ZS as a privateer team and still race in the series today with many wins to date.  After three years without a major sponsor, WSR teamed up with RAC in 2006 and the team was called Team RAC. The MG British Rally Challenge still runs today despite the liquidation in 2005.  

In 2004 plans to race in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM) with a heavily modified V8 powered ZT supertouring car were cancelled due to MG Rover's liquidation in April 2005.

In 2007, a surprise announcement was made that a Super 2000 (S2000) rally car has been prepared in conjunction with rally experts MSD, who used to manage the Hyundai works World Rally team. This is the first sporting step the reformed company has made. Testing has been carried out on the [[MG ZR]] based car & it is expected to enter competition in 2008.
