The '''Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick Memorial Chapel''', known as '''Kirkpatrick Chapel''', is the chapel to [[Rutgers University|Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]] and located on the university's main campus in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] in the United States. Kirkpatrick Chapel is among the university's oldest extant buildings, and one of six buildings located on a historic section of the university's College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick known as the [[Queen's Campus]]. Built in 1873 when Rutgers was a small, private [[liberal arts college]], the chapel was designed by architect [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]] at the beginning of his career.  Hardenbergh, a native of New Brunswick, was the great-great-grandson of [[List of Rutgers University presidents|Rutgers' first president]], the Rev. [[Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh]]. It was the third of three projects that Hardenbergh designed for the college.

Kirkpatrick Chapel was named in honour of Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was the wife of [[Littleton Kirkpatrick]], a local attorney and politician who was a member of the board of trustees of Rutgers College from 1841 until his death in 1859. When Sophia Kirkpatrick died in 1871, Rutgers was named as the [[Residuary estate|residuary]] [[legatee]] of her [[Estate (law)|estate]]. A bequest of $61,054.57 (2013: US$1,174,079.38){{efn|name=SahrOSU1871InflationCalculation|This inflation adjustment calculation projects that $1 in 1871 and 1872 would have $19.23 in purchasing power in 2013 (conversion factor: 0.052), using data compiled by [[Oregon State University]] Political Science professor Robert Sahr in [http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr "Inflation Conversion Factors for years 1774 to estimated 2023, in dollars of recent years"] which he asserts reflects reflecting final 2012 [[Consumer Price Index|CPI]] (2.29594 in dollars of 1982<U+2013>84). Last update 15 May 2013. Retrieved 2 September 2013.}} from her estate funded the construction of the chapel. This marked the first time in New Jersey history that an institution became a direct [[Inheritance|heir]] to an estate.

The chapel was designed in the [[Victorian architecture|High Victorian]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] that was popular at the middle of the nineteenth century in the United States. Hardenbergh's design incorporated features common to fourteenth-century German and English Gothic churches. According to the [[New Jersey Historic Trust]], the chapel<U+2019>s [[stained glass window]]s feature "some of the first opalescent and multicolored sheet glass manufactured in America."  Four of the chapels windows were created by the studios of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]]. Kirkpatrick Chapel was included on the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] on January 29, 1973, and on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 2, 1973.

For its first 30 years, the chapel was used as a college library and for holding daily chapel services. Although Rutgers founded as a private college affiliated with the Dutch Reformed faith, today, it is a state university and nonsectarian. The chapel is available to students, alumni, and faculty of all faiths and a variety of services are held throughout the academic term. It is also used for university events including convocation, concerts, alumni and faculty weddings, funerals, and often as the site of lectures by prominent intellectuals and world leaders.

In his design for Kirkpatrick Chapel, Hardenbergh attempted a "more restrained approach to Gothic architecture" that refrained from the excesses ("fripperies") of typical examples of Victorian Gothic.<ref name="GlovinRUMagCastlesArticle" /> In 1918, ''The Architectural Record'' remarked that the chapel "suggests something of the German Gothic, as seen in the articulation of its triple porch and in its buttress treatment"<ref name="ArchRecordHJHComments1918" />{{rp|p.91}} 

In the application for inclusion on the National Register, alumnus Michael C.

===As the college chapel (1873<U+2013>present)===
For its first fifty years, Kirkpatrick Chapel was used for daily worship services by the Rutgers College student body.<ref name="KCHistory" /> By 1926, the increasing size of the student body had forced Rutgers to stop daily mandatory chapel services and hold services for underclassmen on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; and for upperclassman on Tuesday and Thursday. Within a few years, continued growth in the student body reduced that to each class meeting in chapel only one day per week.  Sunday chapel services were attended by all students who chose to remain on campus for the weekend.<ref>Council of Church Boards of Education in the United States of America. ''Christian Education'' 13:1<U+2013>9 (1929), 301<U+2013>302.</ref> Kirkpatrick Chapel is one of two college chapels on Rutgers' New Brunswick campuses.  The other, [[Voorhees Chapel (Rutgers)|Voorhees Chapel]] was built in 1925 after a donation from Elizabeth Rodman Voorhees to the New Jersey College for Women, later Douglass College, which was later merged into Rutgers.<ref>Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey <U+2014> Mason Gross School of the Arts.

After Rutgers transitioned from a private church-affiliated college to a non-sectarian public  university after World War II, the role of the chapel transitioned to less frequent worship services and religious use to providing a venue for the university's special events<U+2014>including convocations,  lectures, programs, and classes.<ref name="KCHistory" />  Despite this transition, the chapel still has a place in the continuing traditions of the university. Since 1876, graduating classes would have a stone on the exterior of the chapel carved with their class year.  Early classes chose the stone while today, new classes engrave stones that located next to the class that graduated 50 years before.<ref>Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey <U+2014> Kirkpatrick Chapel.
