'''''Grettis saga''''' ({{Audio|Grettis saga.ogg|listen}}) (also known as '''Grettla''', '''Grettir's Saga''' or '''The Saga of Grettir the Strong''') is one of the [[Icelanders' sagas]]. It details the life of Grettir <U+00C1>smundarson, a bellicose [[Iceland]]ic [[outlaw]].

== Overview ==
The saga is categorized as one of the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] (<U+00CD>slendingas<U+00F6>gur) which were written in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries and are fairly realistic accounts of events taking place between the ninth and the eleventh century in Iceland. The matter of such texts is usually conflicts for wealth, prestige, and power.

The author is unknown but it is believed he may have based his story on a previous account of Grettir's life written by [[Sturla <U+00DE><U+00F3>r<U+00F0>arson]].

Grettir's intentions are not necessarily bad, but he is ill-tempered and often does things that he later regrets: he is also very unlucky so that some of his actions have severe unintended consequences.  Grettir spends most of his adult life in Iceland as an outlaw although he sails twice to Norway.  He was related to King Olaf who Christianized Norway. But in Norway too he gets into trouble and is sent away. He is not involved in the [[viking]] raids that many other saga-heroes take part in.

==Story==

Grettir is only introduced to the story in chapter 14. Up until then it tells of his father and grandfather who lived not uneventful lives. His grandfather <U+00D6>nundur from whom he may have inherited his physical strength had been a viking and at one point fought a battle against Kjarval who was king around Dublin. He settles at the northern coast of Iceland and has many sons. Grettir's life is told from beginning to end.  As a child, he is rebellious and bad-tempered. He is described as red haired, somewhat freckled, and broad around the eyes. He is also courageous; he takes on and defeats the ''[[draugr]]'' Gl<U+00E1>mr, an undead being that is in a sense a corporeal ghost, strong and formidable.  But the draugr curses him, and this is seen by the author as the cause of his later misfortunes.

Grettir is sometimes able to be a proper hero, defeating various enemies.  But he is blamed for setting fire to a hall, killing many men, and is condemned to [[Proscription|outlawry]].  This means that anyone can kill him without legal penalty and that people are forbidden to help him in any way; many attempts are made on his life but he wasn't famous for nothing.

Grettir eventually becomes the longest-surviving outlaw in Icelandic history.  When he has nearly completed 20 years as an outlaw, his friends and family ask for his outlawry to be lifted, arguing that a man may not spend more than 20 years as an outlaw according to the law (in actual history there was no such law in medieval Iceland). After a debate at the assembly, it is decided that the outlawry will be lifted when he has truly completed the 20 years but not before. His enemies make one last effort, using sorcery to cause him to wound himself and finally defeat him, atop cliff-sided, lonely, fortress-like [[Drangey]] off the northern tip of [[Iceland]] where he was staying with his brother Illugi, and his slave Glaumur. 

His half brother, Thorsteinn of Dromund, later avenges him in a semi-comic scene in [[Byzantium]], where the Norse served as [[Varangians]].<ref>''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/gre/gre94.htm The Story of Grettir the Strong]'', Ch. 84, trans. by Eir<U+00ED>kr Magn<U+00FA>sson and Willam Morris (1869).</ref>

==Legacy==
Grettir <U+00C1>smundarson was reported to have been from Bjarg in [[Mi<U+00F0>fj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>ur]]. At Bjarg, Grettir <U+00C1>smundarson always had refuge with his mother <U+00C1>sd<U+00ED>s. Many place names in the neighbourhood of [[Bjarg]] and indeed throughout the county bear the name of the outlaw e.g. Grettishaf, Grettistak and Grettish<U+00F6>f<U+00F0>i at Arnarvatn. A memorial was erected to his mother <U+00C1>sd<U+00ED>s at Bjarg in 1974. The memorial displays a relief from ''Grettis Saga'' made by Icelandic artist [[Halld<U+00F3>r P<U+00E9>tursson]]. <ref>[http://www.northwest.is/1sogulegirstadir2.asp ''Bjarg in Mi<U+00F0>fj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>ur'' (Historical Places in Northwest Iceland )]</ref>

Grettir is celebrated in the long poem ''[[Eclogue]] from Iceland'' in the 1938 collection ''The Earth Compels'' by Irish poet [[Louis MacNeice]], who had developed a love of Norse mythology while at school at [[Marlborough College]].  In it, the ghost of Grettir speaks with two men, Craven and Ryan, who have been 'hounded' from a decadent and war-threatened Europe 'whose voice calls in the sirens of destroyers'.  He urges them to recover their underlying humane values, and to assert, as he has, 'the sanctity of the individual will'.  He tells them to return home as an act of duty, which he calls - remembering his own defiant choice to be an outlaw - 'Your hazard, your act of defiance and hymn of hate, hatred of hatred, assertion of human values' and (in the poem's final words') 'your only chance'.
