[[Ice Hockey]] has been a key element of [[Canada]]'s cultural and social history. This has been captured on various releases from [[Canada Post]]. In the 2000's, the key release has been the series of [[National Hockey League]] All-Stars. The series lasted from [[2000]] to [[2005]]. Other hockey issues have included a stamp to commemorate the International Postal Hockey Tournament and a stamp to commemorate the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] featured a hockey player. <ref>http://www.collectionscanada.ca/archivianet/020117/020117030423_e.html</ref>
