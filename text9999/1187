==Gameplay==
[[Image:Wario World battle.jpg|thumb|left|Wario fighting enemies]]
''Wario World''{{'}}s gameplay centers mainly on combating enemies, although it requires some platform navigation similar to ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The controls are simple, and are only used to jump, run, dash, perform fighting moves, and use the "Hyper Suction" ability to consume nearby coins.<ref>{{cite book|year=2003|title=Wario World instruction booklet|publisher=Nintendo|language=Swedish|pages=6-7}}</ref> The level designs are platform-based with combat elements, and have an overall linear design.

==Development==
''Wario World'' was first shown at [[E3]] 2002 as a [[technology demo|technical demo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/360/360686p1.html|title=E3 2002: Hands on Wario World|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=2002-05-23|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> At the next E3 in 2003, it was shown with new levels of gameplay polish and tweaking, which the previous E3 demo was lacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/402/402176p1.html|title=E3 2003: Hands-on Wario World|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Lewis, Cory D.|date=2003-05-14|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> On [[August 22]], [[2002]], at Nintendo's Gamer's Summit, ''Wario World''{{'}}s [[North America]]n release date was set to [[November 11]], [[2002]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/368/368611p1.html|title=Wario Gets a Date|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=2002-08-22|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> The game was later going to be released on [[May 26]], [[2003]], but was further delayed by one month till June 23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/388/388645p1.html|title=F-Zero and Wario Delayed|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=2003-03-10|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>

It was uncertain who was developing ''Wario World'', until [[April 22]], [[2003]], when Nintendo of America officially revealed that [[Treasure (company)|Treasure]], the company behind the successful titles ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'' and ''[[Ikaruga]]'', was developing the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/394/394648p1.html|title=Treasure and Wario World|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=2003-04-22|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> After the successful development collaboration Treasure and Nintendo shared with the [[Nintendo 64]] title, ''[[Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth]]'', the two companies wanted to work together again.

===Critical response===
The overall reception of ''Wario World'' was fairly positive. The [[United Kingdom|UK]] version of ''[[Play (UK magazine)|Play]]'' magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that ''Wario World'' "pays off every second I'm holding the controller, and that, to me, is greatness."<ref>{{citation| date= June 2003 | periodical= [[Play (UK magazine)|Play]]| publisher= [[Imagine Publishing]] |pages= 60}}</ref> ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' said that the game was "tons of fun."<ref>{{citation| date= July 2003 | periodical= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Future US]] |pages= 80}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]'' stated that ''Wario World'' "stays addictive by weight of sheer design innovation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/gamecube/games/reviews/29907.shtml|title=Wario World review|publisher=[[GamePro]]|author=Fennecfox|date=2003-06-23|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> The American-based publication ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game for including "droves of awesome boss battles." [[Matt Casamassina]] of [[IGN]] meant that ''Wario World'' had "some great control mechanics and inventive level work."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/425/425079p1.html|title=Wario World review|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Casamassina, Matt|date=2003-06-19|accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>

''Wario World'' also received criticism, mainly because various reviewers found the game was shorter than one would expect for a console title. Tom Bramwell of [[Eurogamer]] compared ''Wario World'' to ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', a game also criticized for its length, and said that the game was like ''Luigi's Mansion'' "all over again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=52365|title=Wario World review|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|author=Bramwell, Tom|date=2003-06-19|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> [[GameSpy]] stated that ''Wario World'' "offers little above and beyond the standard 3D platform romp, and what is offered turns out to be very short and repetitive."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/wario-world/5950p1.html|title=Wario World review|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|author=Williams, Bryn|date=2003-07-25|accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] commented that "the final product is too short and simplistic to hold your attention for more than a day."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/warioworld/review.html|title=Wario World review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=Gerstmann, Jeff|date=2003-07-20|accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>
