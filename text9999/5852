He is known for his inking work on a wide variety of [[DC Comics]] titles, including the continuity-redefining classic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985<U+2013>1986), his long run working on the [[Superman]] titles from 1986<U+2013>1993, and for writing and painting the [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] [[original graphic novel]] ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' (1994), and writing the on-going monthly series from 1995<U+2013>1999.

==Early life and influences==
Ordway was inspired in his childhood by [[Marvel Comics]], and dreamed of drawing [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Spider-Man]], and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. (To date he has only worked on the latter.)

Among the artists he considers influential are [[Curt Swan]], [[Jack Kirby]], [[Gil Kane]], [[John Buscema]], [[Steve Ditko]], all of whose pencils he would later ink over. He cites [[Gene Colan]], [[Wally Wood]], [[Alex Raymond]], [[Hal Foster]] and [[Roy Crane]] as early inspirations. He names contemporaries such as [[Lee Weeks]], [[John Romita, Jr.]], [[Ron Garney]], [[Mike Weiringo]] and [[Alan Davis]], and inkers such as [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Dick Giordano]], [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] and [[Klaus Janson]].<ref name=Rough/>

Jerry Ordway attended [[Lynde & Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School|Milwaukee Technical High School]], where he took a three-year commercial art course, before joining a commercial art studio as a [[typographer]] in 1976. He subsequently worked his way "from the ground floor up at the art studio" between 1978 and 1981.<ref name="Bails"/><ref name=Rough/>

==Comics career==
Before beginning his professional career as an inker, Jerry Ordway broke into comics as an artist and publisher for small-press [[comics fanzine]]s. Ordway discovered Marvel comics in "June of 1967," and wrote in 1975 (aged 17) that he had "been drawing superheroes [ever] since." His first published work, a story entitled "The Messenger", appeared in ''Tim Corrigan's Superhero Comics'' No.&nbsp;4 (April, 1975), and his own self-published fanzine ''Okay Comix'' followed in May<U+2013>June, 1975.<ref name=OKAY>Ordway, Jerry "What? Another 'zine?" in Ordway's ''Okay Comix'' No.&nbsp;1 (May<U+2013>June, 1975), p. 2</ref> ''Okay Comix'' featured stories by Ordway and his friend Dave Koula, and art predominantly by Ordway himself. Ordway's own hero "Proton" headlined the 'zine, which featured a pin-up of a character "called Acrobat" who was "the first superhero [Ordway] created. His birth was Dec. 1969."<ref name="Okay2">''Okay Comix'' No.&nbsp;1 (May<U+2013>June, 1975), p. 24</ref>

Spending the late 1970s working as a painter in a commercial art studio in Milwaukee, between 1978 and 1979, he provided illustrations for a number of fanzines and pro-zines, including ''Omniverse'' and ''[[The Comics Journal]]''. His first professional work was for [[Western Publishing]]'s [[Golden Books]] on young-reader Marvel books, and the ''Superheroes Golden Beginning Stampbook '79''.<ref name="Bails"/><ref name=Rough/>

===DC Comics===
Having produced comics-related artwork for fanzines and licenced publishers, Ordway attended "a talent search at the 1980 Chicago Comicon," held by DC Comics. After showing them his "DC related artwork from the Golden Books," he "walked away with a promise of work."<ref name=Rough/> This work began in the summer of 1980 for "DC's anthology comics," (including ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' and ''[[Mystery in Space]]''<ref name="Bails"/>) in which he "inked [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Trevor Von Eeden]], as well as [[Joe Staton]], and [[Dave Cockrum]]." After continuing to work at the art studio for a further six months, inking comics for DC by night, Ordway began "freelancing full time in February 1981." During the mid-1980s, he "shared a studio with other artists, including [[Mike Machlan|Machlan]], [[Pat Broderick]], and [[Al Vey]]."<ref name=Rough/>

At DC, he would illustrate ''[[All Star Squadron]]'', a series which he helped launch in an [[DC Comics insert previews|insert preview]] in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' No.&nbsp;193 (Aug. 1981)<ref name="GCD">[http://www.comics.org/search/advanced/process/?target=sequence&method=icontains&logic=True&order1=date&order2=series&order3=&start_date=&end_date=&title=&feature=&job_number=&pages=&script=Jerry+Ordway&pencils=Jerry+Ordway&inks=Jerry+Ordway&colors=&letters=&story_editing=&genre=&characters=&synopsis=&reprint_notes=&notes=&pub_name=&country=us&pub_notes=&brand=&brand_notes=&indicia_publisher=&is_surrogate=None&ind_pub_notes=&series=&series_notes=&tracking_notes=&issue_count=&issues=&volume=&issue_title=&variant_name=&issue_date=&indicia_frequency=&price=&issue_pages=&format=&issue_editing=&isbn=&barcode=&issue_notes=&is_indexed=None Jerry Ordway] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> With writer [[Roy Thomas]], he co-created ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' in ''All-Star Squadron'' #25 (Sept. 1983)<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 203 |quote = The children of the original Justice Society of America made their smash debut in this issue by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Jerry Ordway...''All-Star Squadron'' #25 marked the first appearances of future cult-favorite heroes Jade, Obsidian, Fury,<!--[Hippolyta "Lyta" Trevor made her first appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #300 (Feb. 1983), ''All-Star Squadron'' #25 was her first appearance using the name "Fury"]--> Brainwave Jr., the Silver Scarab, Northwind, and Nuklon.}}</ref> and the new team was launched in its own series in March 1984.<ref>Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 207: "Written by DC's Golden Age guru Roy Thomas and drawn by Jerry Ordway, ''Infinity, Inc.'' was released in DC's new deluxe format on bright Baxter paper."</ref> Ordway inked ''[[DC Comics Presents]] Annual'' No.&nbsp;4 (1985) over artist [[Eduardo Barreto]]'s pencils and was one of several artists on ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]] Annual'' No.&nbsp;9 (July 1985), and more notably inked [[George P<U+00E9>rez]]'s pencils on the epic crossover miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985. Ordway inked legendary Superman artist [[Wayne Boring]]'s pencils for a retelling of the definitive [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Golden Age Superman]] origin story written by [[Roy Thomas]] in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' No.&nbsp;1 (April 1986), which he considers a particular favorite.<ref name=Rough/> Ordway was the penciller and inker for the DC Comics adaptation of the 1989 [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'' film]] which was published as a "movie special".<ref name="GCD" />

Particularly highly regarded for his inking, Ordway has however noted that "Inking is a weird job, because as much as you put into it, the page still belongs to the penciler."<ref name=Rough/>

===Superman===
{{main|Superman|The Man of Steel (comics)}}
In 1986, along with writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and writer [[Marv Wolfman]], Ordway was one of the architects trusted with revamping [[Superman]], in the wake of the Ordway-inked continuity-redefining maxiseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Launching, with a revised origin and new continuity, in Byrne's miniseries, ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'', Superman soon returned to featuring in a number of titles. After the titular title ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' was cancelled and replaced with ''The Man of Steel'', it was swiftly relaunched as ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', continuing the numbering of the original ''Superman'' comic, with Wolfman as writer and Ordway as primary artist.<ref>Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 226: "The original Superman title had adopted the new title ''The Adventures of Superman'' but continued the original numbering of its long and storied history. Popular writer Marv Wolfman and artist Jerry Ordway handled the creative chores."</ref> 

When Wolfman departed the title, John Byrne briefly took over scriptwriting duties before Ordway assumed the mantle of writer-artist and took over the series solely. Switching from ''The Adventures of Superman'', Ordway took over as writer-artist on the companion title ''[[Superman (vol. 2)]]'' between 1989 and 1991, before later returning to ''Adventures'' as writer. Ordway was the writer and primary artist for the story in which Clark Kent proposes to [[Lois Lane]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Ordway, Jerry| penciller= [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]]; [[Brett Breeding|Breeding, Brett]]; [[Kerry Gammill|Gammill, Kerry]]; [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]]; Ordway, Jerry; [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | inker= Breeding, Brett; [[Dennis Janke|Janke, Dennis]]; Byrne, John; Ordway, Jerry | story= Krisis of the Krimson Kryptonite, Part 4: The Human Factor| title= Superman| volume= 2| issue= 50 | date= December 1990 }}</ref><ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 247: "When [Clark Kent] proposed to his longtime love Lois Lane, he did so in a modest fashion...Lois accepted and comic book history was made, served up by writer/artist Jerry Ordway."</ref>  While writing for the Superman family of titles, Ordway cowrote such storylines as "Panic in the Sky"<ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 253: "In this seven-part adventure...writers Dan Jurgens, Jerry Ordway, Roger Stern, and Louise Simonson, with artists Brett Breeding, Tom Grummett, Jon Bogdanove, and Bob McLeod assembled many of DC's favorite characters to defend the world."</ref> and "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline in 1992. After seven years working on the character, Ordway largely left the Superman titles in 1993, although he would make frequent returns to the character as writer and artist throughout his career.<ref name="GCD" />
 
During the 50th anniversary celebrations for Superman, he inked [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s pencils for the cover of the March 14, 1988 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19880314,00.html|title= Superman at 50|author= |date= |work= Time Archive 1923 to the Present|publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref> and an interior spread celebrating the Man of Steel's anniversary. Ordway has produced a large number of covers for DC from 1982 onwards, including for issues of ''[[Secret Origins]]'' and the painted cover art to the hardcover reprint collection ''The Greatest Golden Age Stories Ever Told''<ref>{{cite book| last =| first =| title = The Greatest Golden Age Stories Ever Told | publisher = DC Comics| date = 1990| pages = 288| url = | isbn = 0-930289-57-9 }}</ref> He produced the cover art for the [[prestige format]] [[graphic novel]]s, ''Superman: The Earth Stealers'' in 1988 where he inked [[Curt Swan]]'s pencils and ''Superman For Earth'' (1991), among other work.<ref name="GCD" />

===Captain Marvel===
{{main|The Power of Shazam!}}
In 1994, Ordway masterminded the return of the original [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to the [[DC Universe]] with the 96-page hardcover graphic novel ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', which he both wrote and painted. The story saw Ordway depict the revamped origins of the former-[[Fawcett Comics]] superhero. An early example of the one-shot [[Original Graphic Novel]], it proved to be a success, and was followed by an on-going monthly series, also titled ''The Power of Shazam!'' (which ran between 1995 and 1999). Ordway wrote and provided painted covers for the entire run of the regular series, as well as illustrating fill-in issues between series-regular artists [[Peter Krause (artist)|Peter Krause]] and [[Mike Manley (artist)|Mike Manley]].<ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 269: "Writer Jerry Ordway chronicled the further adventures of Billy Batson, the World's Mightiest Mortal, in the new ongoing effort ''The Power of Shazam!'', alongside artists Mike Manley and Peter Krause."</ref> Towards the end of the series run, he again took on the dual role of writer & artist.

==Other work==
===Non-DC work===
During the mid-1980s, Ordway provided covers and occasional artwork to titles from a number of different comics companies. Companies included [[Wendy Pini|Richard and Wendy Pini]]'s [[WaRP Graphics]], [[AC Comics]], [[Charlton Comics]], [[Paragon Publications]] and fan-turned-pro [[Martin Greim|Marty Greim]]. For [[Eclipse Comics]], Ordway provided pencils for a short "Epilogue" story in [[Mark Evanier]]'s ''[[DNAgents]]'' No.&nbsp;18 (Jan 1985). <ref name="GCD" /> He produced ''Munden's Bar'' for [[First Comics]], and provided pencils and inks on an issue of ''[[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]]''.<ref name="Bails"/>

For [[Image Comics]], Ordway co-created the character [[WildStar]] (with [[Al Gordon (comics)|Al Gordon]]) in 1993, and published his creator-owned one-shot ''The Messenger'' in July 2000.<ref name="GCD" />
<!--Based on his earliest published work, presumably!--> 

Although the vast majority of Ordway's professional work has been produced for DC, between inking ''All-Star Squadron'' and ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' for DC, Ordway inked issues of Marvel's ''[[Fantastic Four]]''. He produced occasional work for Marvel between 1984 and 1988, then returned a decade later to write and illustrate a three-issue arc of ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #16<U+2013>18 (1999), as well as penciling the four-issue crossover mini-series ''Maximum Security'' (#1<U+2013>3 and prologue ''Dangerous Planet'') in 2000<U+2013>2001.<ref name="GCD" />

===Other DC work===
As well as inking most of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Ordway inked the second of DC's continuity-redefining event titles in 1994 by inking writer-artist [[Dan Jurgens]]' pencils on ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]''.<ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 266: "In DC's newest summer blockbuster ''Zero Hour'', writer/artist Dan Jurgens and finisher Jerry Ordway crafted a five-issue story that began with issue #4, and counted backward to zero."</ref> To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the original ''Crisis'', DC published [[Geoff Johns]]' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series (Dec 2005 <U+2013> Jun 2006), for which Ordway provided the artwork for the flashback scenes set on [[Earth-Two]], including a recreation of the cover to ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, which he cites as another favorite piece of his.<ref name=Rough/> In the wake of ''Infinite Crisis'', he inked [[Dan Jurgens]]' pencils once again in the "History of the Multiverse" back-up stories in the weekly comic book ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|''Countdown'']]'' (issues No.&nbsp;39 and No.&nbsp;38, Chapters 11 and 12) (October 2007).<ref name="GCD" />

In 2001, he drew the one-shot ''[[Just Imagine...]] Stan Lee with Jerry Ordway Creating the JLA'' as part of comics legend and Marvel-stalwart [[Stan Lee]]'s foray into the DC Universe, in which the two of them re-imagined DC's [[Justice League of America]]. He inked the last year (May 2002 <U+2013> May 2003) of the [[Batman family]] title ''[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael: Agent of the Bat]]'' (#88 <U+2013> #100), and provided the artwork for a six-issue story arc in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2, issues #189<U+2013>194), with writer [[Walt Simonson]] in 2003. From 2003-2008, he provided new covers to ''Superman: The Man of Steel'' series of six trade paperbacks, collecting the early adventures of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] Superman.<ref name="GCD" />
    
His work since 2008 includes pencilling three issues of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' (volume 2) (#11<U+2013>13, May<U+2013>July 2008) with writer [[Mark Waid]], and pencils for ''[[Justice Society of America]] Annual'' No.&nbsp;1 (Sept. 2008), alongside some interior artwork for the on-going ''Justice Society of America'' series during late 2008.<ref name="GCD" /> In 2012, Ordway worked on a [[Challengers of the Unknown]] storyline for ''[[DC Universe Presents]]'' with DC Co-Publisher [[Dan DiDio]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=35378|title= DiDio Takes "Challengers of the Unknown" Into "DCU Presents"|first= |last= |date= November 10, 2011 |publisher= [[ComicBookResources.com]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/65o7STgkJ
