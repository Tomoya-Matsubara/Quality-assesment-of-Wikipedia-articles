'''Rimsky-Korsakoffee House''', located in the [[Buckman, Portland, Oregon|Buckman]] neighborhood of southeast [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States, is one of the city's oldest [[coffeehouse]]s. Named after Russian composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], the [[classical music]]-themed coffeehouse serves coffee and desserts, operating from the former living room of a reportedly [[Haunted house|haunted]] 1902 [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]]-style house. Goody Cable started the business in 1980, having hosted classical music events in her home for years prior.

Rimsky-Korsakoffee has a casual, communal atmosphere and sometimes features live classical music. The house is decorated with [[Bric-<U+00E0>-brac|knickknacks]], art and hanging objects. Tables are named for various composers; some of them are "haunted" (animated), at times elevating, rotating or vibrating. The coffeehouse has received a generally positive reception and is known mostly for its desserts and for offering a unique experience to guests. Rimsky-Korsakoffee has been called "eclectic", "quirky" and "spooky", and has been recognized by several publications for its coffee and desserts.
