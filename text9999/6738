'''''21''''' is the second studio album by British singer-songwriter [[Adele (singer)|Adele]]. The album was released on 21 January 2011 in the UK and most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America.<ref name="iTunes" /><ref name="public.gr" /> The follow-up to her 2008 debut ''[[19 (Adele album)|19]]'', ''21'' was named after the age of the singer at the time of its production. While it relies heavily on the [[folk music|folk]] and [[Motown]] influences that framed her debut, the album also explores various genres and styles from [[country music|country]] and [[blues music|blues]] to alternative pop and [[R&B]]. ''21'' is a break-up album, with the majority of the songs focusing on aspects of the singer's most recently ended relationship.   

''21'' features production from [[Rick Rubin]], [[Paul Epworth]], and [[Ryan Tedder]] among others, and was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers lauding Adele's vocal performance and introspective songwriting. Preceded by lead single "[[Rolling in the Deep]]", the album debuted at number one on the [[UK Album Chart]], selling 208,000 copies, as well as debuting at number one in over ten countries, including Canada, Germany and Ireland. It also debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Chart with sales of 352,000 copies, so far the largest first-week sales in the U.S. of 2011. 

Following an acclaimed performance of the album's second single "[[Someone Like You (Adele song)|Someone Like You]]" at the 2011 [[BRIT Awards]], the album maintained its number one position in the UK for a total of eleven consecutive weeks, before being dethroned by the [[Foo Fighters]]' ''[[Wasting Light]]'' on the week ending 24 April 2011. However, ''21'' returned to the top spot the following week and has so far spent fifteen cumulative weeks at number one. The album's eleven-week consecutive run at the top broke the record for the longest running consecutive number-one studio album for a solo artist.<ref name="Billboard Charts" /> It also became the biggest-selling digital album of all-time in the UK.<ref name="Gaga" /> ''21'' has been certified eight-times platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]], denoting domestic shipments in excess of 2.4 million units.<ref name="BPI" /> In the U.S., the album has so far spent seven non-consecutive weeks at number one, and has sold over 1.5 million copies.<ref name="Sixth Week" />

==Background and conception==
Similar to her first album ''[[19 (album)|19]]'', ''21'' is essentially a break-up album,<ref name="OMH" /> reflecting Adele's feelings toward the failure of her relationship. Prior to the album's production, her relationship achieved notoriety in the British press when it was revealed that she canceled her 2008 U.S. and European tour [[An Evening with Adele]] (in support of her debut album) in order to spend time with her boyfriend.<ref name="Booze" /> She later revealed that a number of other personal factors contributed to her decision.<ref name="MTVL" /><ref name="Failure" /> The breakdown of the relationship left the singer devastated,<ref name= "stone" /> as she described it "the biggest deal in my entire life to date. . .It's going to take me ten years to recover."<ref name="Broke my heart" /> The singer decided to craft ''21'' as a confessional album in which she documented her emotional journey and channelled the pain of her break-up.<ref name="Billboard Cover" />

Adele originally intended to title the album '''''Rolling in the Deep''''',<ref name= "Roll Deep" /> her adaptation of a British [[slang]] "roll deep," which, in her words means, "[to] always have someone that has your back".<ref name="Articulate" /> She explains that "that's how I felt in the relationship that the record's about... [that] that's what I was always going to have, and...it ended up not being the case."<ref name="Articulate" /> She decided against the title because she deemed it too confusing for audiences outside of the UK.<ref name= "Roll Deep" /> While admitting the overt simplicity in titling her album ''21'', the singer suggests that the name is the most appropriate for the album<U+2014> not only does it serve as a reflection of her age at the time of production, it also establishes a juxtaposition with ''19'', symbolizing her personal and artistic growth:

<Blockquote>"It<U+2019>s [''21''] different from ''19'', it<U+2019>s about the same things but in a different light. I deal with things differently now. I<U+2019>m more patient, more honest, more forgiving and more aware of my own flaws, habits and principles. Something that comes with age I think. So fittingly this record is called ''21''. The whole reason I called my first album ''19'' was about cataloging what happened to me then and who I was then, like a photo album you see the progression and changes in a person throughout the years." <br> <U+2014> Adele, on her personal blog, discussing the inspiration behind the name of her second album.<ref name="Adele blog" /></br> </Blockquote>

Many critics agreed and lauded Adele's artistic growth, praising the songs for their depth and maturity.<ref name= "ripcord" /><ref name="AbsolutePunk" /> A critic from Clash Music.com writes, "In the two years between the titles of Adele<U+2019>s debut and this, her second album, she<U+2019>s clearly seen the world. Where ''19'' marked the turbulent swan song to a teenage life, ''21'' introduces the realities of adult life, where grown-up responsibilities collide with heartache and emotional scars run deep."<ref name="Clash" />

An avid fan of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), Adele expressed interest in working with the album's producer [[Rick Rubin]]. She first met him when she appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 2008, recognizing and signalling to him in the audience during her live performance of "[[Chasing Pavements]]".<ref name="MTVL" /> Following a few chance meetings they eventually decided to collaborate after meeting at the [[2009 Grammy Awards]].<ref name="MTVL" /> Similarly, Adele's meeting with [[Ryan Tedder]] was coincidental. They first met at the 2009 Grammy Awards in the elevator of the hotel they both happened to be staying in.<ref name="Track by Track" /> Following their acquaintance, they decided to collaborate on tracks for her second album, producing "Rumour Has It" and "Turning Tables". Additional collaborators include [[Jim Abbiss]], and [[Eg White|Francis "Eg" White]], who worked with Adele on her debut album, as well as [[Fraser T Smith]], [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]] and [[Paul Epworth]].

==Music and production==
===Influence and sound===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="I wanted the songs not to have anything glittery or glamorous about them, like an organic tapestry rather than like a [[Lady Gaga|Gaga]] album...I mean, I love Gaga, but I didn't want to get wrapped up in all that European dance music."<br><U+2014> Adele speaks to ''Rolling Stone'' about the musical direction of her album.<ref name="Rolling Stone" />}}

In interviews, Adele has stated that her exposure to American [[country music]] provided the framework for her album's sound.<ref name="Rolling Stone" /><ref name= "ripcord" /><ref name="CMT" /> While on her [[An Evening with Adele|2008<U+2013>2009 tour]] in the U.S., Adele frequently went on smoke breaks (she no longer smokes)<ref name="CMT" /> with her tour bus driver,<ref name="MTVL" /> a [[Nashville, Tennessee]] native, who introduced her to various types of southern music styles, including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[rockabilly]], during these breaks.<ref name="MTVL" /> In particular, she listened to albums by [[Garth Brooks]],<ref name="MTVL" /> [[Wanda Jackson]], [[Alison Krauss]]<ref name="Rolling Stone" /> [[Lady Antebellum]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Rascal Flatts]].<ref name="Wallstreet" /> Adele states, "I find country music really exciting because I know actually fuck-all about it. So every day I'm hearing something that I love, that I don't know....It feels like I'm discovering music again for the first time."<ref name="Track by Track" /> Lily Moayeri, writing for ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'', states that "Exposure to the likes of Wanda Jackson and Lady Antebellum [gave] Adele a country bent and a genuine understanding of the blues. These styles suit her retro-soul voice perfectly."<ref name="Radar" /> 

''21'' relies heavily on the same [[Motown]] influences that informed ''19'',<ref name="Wallstreet" /> with old-school, retro-infused production and the "[[The Supremes|Supremes]]-esque backing vocals"<ref name="Consequence of Sound" /> featured on songs like "[[Rolling in the Deep]]". However the album incorporated such instruments as the [[saxophone]], [[harp]], [[banjo]] and the [[accordion]], exploring styles ranging from Southern blues and soul music<ref name= "ripcord" /> to jazz and [[bossa nova]],<ref name="RS Review" /> to alternative pop<ref name="Metacritic" /> and gospel infused<ref name="MTVUK" /> rock music. Regarding the wide range of musical styles, Adele explains: "It<U+2019>s all tied together by my voice...I don<U+2019>t have a definitive sound. I have no idea what I sound like yet, so until I do, all my records will have a kind of [[mix-tape]] vibe going on."<ref name= "Roll Deep" />

The album comprises mainly slow and mid-tempo ballads and [[torch songs]],<ref name="Financial Times" /><ref name="Matters" /> characterized by "bold melodies [and] chest-clutching singing".<ref name= "urb" /> Matthew Cole of [[Slant Magazine]] criticized what he thought was the "formulaic" structure of the songs, suggesting that the production team  on ''21'' seemed unanimous on what constituted an "Adele song": "a four-minute runtime; a mixture of [[string instruments|strings]], [[piano]], and [[acoustic guitar]], which should begin quietly and swell up around the two-minute mark; and a chorus which should recur no fewer than four times over the course of the song."<ref name="slant" /> Adele expressed her desire to strip the songs to their basic elements in an attempt to produce a more "open" and "articulate" record than her first.<ref name="Articulate" /> The understated nature of songs like "Don't You Remember", "Turning Tables", "[[Someone Like You (Adele song)|Someone Like You]]" and "I Found a Boy", where Adele's sole musical accompaniment is a piano or a guitar, is meant to place more emphasis on Adele's vocal performance, giving the album a raw, uninhibited feel.<ref name="Lamb, Bill" /> Adele later explains, "It's such an honest record, and I'm really moved by it... It's not hidden behind anything, and even though that's what I wanted, I was a little bit scared of it."<ref name="Rolling Stone" /> 

===Writing and recording===
Adele deems her debut album limited in its depiction of her as a person, suggesting that the album's "seriousness"<ref name="Times Newspaper" /> contrasted with her true demeanour as a "fun, cheeky, loud, [and] sarcastic 22 year-old".<ref name="Times Newspaper" /> As early as April 2009,<ref name="Failing" /> while still in the relationship that inspired ''21'', Adele attempted to compose songs that not only explored her failing relationship,<ref name="Failing" /> but would also capture her lighter, "spirited"<ref name="Times Newspaper" /> side. However, repeated studio sessions were unsuccessful, and "Take It All",<ref name="Together" /> produced during these sessions, was the only song with which she was completely satisfied.<ref name="Times Newspaper" /> The main inspiration for the songs followed Adele's break-up, the majority of which began as "drunken diary ramblings",<ref name="Failure" /> which she later refined into musical compositions.<ref name="Failure" /> They were written over a three-month period between November 2009 and January 2010.<ref name="Failing" /><ref name="Failure" /><ref name="Second Album" /> While Adele usually assumes a great degree of creative control over her work,<ref name="world" /> she explained that,  compared to her debut, ''21'' is considerably more collaborative:<ref name= "Collaborative" /> "I was really worried about making '''19'' 2.0,' so I co-wrote a lot more on this record. The first record was 80%<U+2013>85% all written by me; this one is 55%<U+2013>65% me...When I was doing ''19,'' I was a typical stubborn teenager. I was like 'No, I can do it all on my own!'"<ref name= "Collaborative" /> In a move to improve her songwriting, Adele immersed herself into various styles of music, attempting to gain insight into the structuring and composition of songs from various genres. She barricaded herself in her home for three weeks, and "just listened to loads of music...[[hip-hop]], country, pop, loads of stuff I like already, loads of stuff I don't even like, and just trying to understand what it is about a song that moves me; where it peaks, why I think it peaks, stuff like that, just kind of studying it."<ref name="RRubin" />

 | description = The first single from ''21'', Adele says of the song: It is my reaction to being told [by my ex] that my life is going to be boring and lonely and rubbish...and I wrote that as a sort of 'fuck you'."<ref name="Track by Track" />}}

Adele composed "Rolling in the Deep" the day after the relationship ended: "We'd had a fuming argument the night before...I'd been bubbling, then I went into the studio and screamed."<ref name="Times Newspaper" /> While in the studio with [[Paul Epworth]], Adele intended to write a ballad; Epworth replied "absolutely not", suggesting that they write a "fierce tune"<ref name="Calgary" /> instead. While composing the song, Adele asked Epworth to feel her racing heartbeat, which inspired the song's beat.<ref name="Calgary" /> Adele then started singing the first verse [[a capella]], as Epoworth joined in, improvising on his [[guitar]]. "Rolling in the Deep" was recorded in less than two days.<ref name="Times Newspaper" /> The demo was used as the final version, as Adele's repeated attempts to re-record the song failed to capture the "raw" emotion of the demo.<ref name="Times Newspaper" /> In an interview, Adele expressed her initial reservations prior to meeting with Epworth, due to their divergent musical styles: "I wasn't really expecting anything out of the session, just because he is known for being very [[indie music|indie]] and I'm known to be very pop, so I wasn't sure if it would work too well. But it ended up being a match made in heaven...he brought a lot out of me. He brought my voice out as well<U+2014> there's notes that I hit in that song ["Rolling in the Deep"] that I never even knew I could hit."<ref name="Track by Track" /> 

With the exception of "Rumour Has It", co-written and produced by [[Ryan Tedder]], and "Someone Like You", co-written and co-produced with [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]], the songs were all written in [[London]]. A number of studio sessions also took place in [[London]] with [[Paul Epworth]]. However, the majority of the album's production with Rubin were recorded in his studio in [[Malibu, California]] over a course of five weeks, beginning in April 2010.<ref name="Failing" /><ref name="Calgary" /> Recovering from her tour, Adele expected to relax and enjoy Malibu in-between recording the album. However, she stated that she disliked the area and suffered [[boredom]], [[homesickness]], [[sunburn]], and [[food poisoning]].<ref name="Times Newspaper" /><ref name="Calgary" /> Working with Rubin, on the other hand, was a dream come true. The pair had a more relaxed approach to the production process: "We just vibed until it felt right and there was no referencing of things in the charts that were doing well or whatever, no seeing what was hot and what was not, and there are no [[music samples|samples]] used at all. I could sit here now and play the entire record completely live without any electricity. It was just so organic."<ref name="RRubin" /> Their collaboration produced the tracks "Don't You Remember", "He Won't Go", "One  and Only", and a remake of [[The Cure]]'s "[[Lovesong (The Cure song)|Lovesong]]". Sessions were completed with a team of musicians that Rubin assembled, including [[Chris Dave]] on drums, [[Matt Sweeney]] on guitar,  [[James Poyser]] on [[piano]], and [[Pino Palladino]] on bass.<ref name="Rolling Stone" /><ref name="KMTT" /><ref name="Times Newspaper" /> Rubin felt that Adele had a different live sound, compared to the studio recordings on her first album, and attempted to capture this sound in their sessions.<ref name="Calgary" /> Adele initially intended to cover a song by [[INXS]], but later changed to a remake of the Cure's "Lovesong". Originally arranged for [[Barbra Streisand]], Adele fell in love with the unused demo and decided to record it. Prior to recording "Lovesong", Adele lost her voice, but in an interview stated that it "suited the song".<ref name="Track by Track" />

On "Someone Like You", one of the last songs written for the album, Adele collaborated with famed musician and producer [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]]. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele wrote most of the lyrics using her guitar.<ref name="KMTT" /> The two sat around the piano for almost a day and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, ultimately deciding to keep the musical production sparse: "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school."<ref name="KMTT" />

 |pos=left }}

The order of the songs on the album mirror the range of emotions Adele experienced after the breakup,<ref name="Together" /> progressing from themes of anger and bitterness,<ref name="Together" /><ref name= "Monitor" /> to feelings of loneliness, "heartbreak and regret",<ref name= "Monitor" /> and finally, as exemplified by the last song, acceptance.<ref name= "Monitor" /> Adele describes the album's first track "[[Rolling in the Deep]]" as a <U+201C>dark, bluesy, gospel, disco tune."<ref name="MTVUK" /> She states, "[the song] is my reaction to being told [by my ex] that my life is going to be boring and lonely and rubbish, and that I was a weak person if I didn't stay in the relationship.<ref name="Track by Track" /> And I wrote that as a sort of 'fuck you'."<ref name="Track by Track" /> The song begins with Adele singing against a steady guitar strum, then continues with "martial beats", "pounding piano chords" (played by [[Neil Cowley]]) and "chanting [[backing vocalist|backing singers]]",<ref name="Lamb" /> followed by a broken down, hand-clapping bridge reminiscent of the soul music of the [[deep south]].<ref name="AV Club" /> One of the more uptempo songs on the album,<ref name="Track by Track" /> the [[Ryan Tedder]]-produced "Rumour Has It" is a percussion-driven jazz number,<ref name="AbsolutePunk" /> which Adele describes as a "bluesy pop stomping song".<ref name="Tedder song" /> Adele states that the song was not inspired by her ex, but was written about her own friends, who had a tendency to spread rumours about her break-up.<ref name="Track by Track" /><ref name="Tedder song" /> The song contrasts with the second Tedder-collaborated song "Turning Tables", the albums third track, produced by [[Jim Abbiss]]. "Turning Tables" was conceived following a confrontation with Adele's ex. Adele arrived at the studio upset and emotional that her ex kept "turning the tables" on her during their arguments, and Tedder used this idea as a concept for composing the song.<ref name="Track by Track" /> Lyrically, the song describes the stage of the relationship marked by constant fighting and contention, followed by the realization that the relationship has run its course. The song begins as an understated piano-and-vocal ballad, stripped down to its most minimal elements, and towards the climax, swells into a "cinematic pop anthem laced with Broadway-worthy strings"<ref name="Paste Mag" /> that "serves as a fitting counterpoint to its heartbroken, hollowed-out lyrics."<ref name="Paste Mag" />

As the album progresses, the theme changes from one of anger and defensiveness to feelings of reflection and heartbreak, exemplified by the Rick Rubin produced "Don<U+2019>t You Remember", co-written by Adele and [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]].<ref name="Track by Track" /> A country styled ballad,<ref name="Failure" /><ref name= "ripcord" /><ref name="MTVUK" /> the song was one of the last to be composed for the album.<ref name="CMT" /> After completing a number of songs, Adele had become aware of how her bitterness towards the break-up had negatively coloured her perception of her ex: "I managed to step out of the bitter mode that I was in when I was writing the record and I suddenly got really ashamed and disgusted with the manner that I was portraying someone who was really important to me...and I felt really childish that I had made him out to be a complete twat."<ref name="Track by Track" /> The song is an admission of her own shortcomings, as well as a plea to her ex to remember why he initially fell in love with her.<ref name="Track by Track" /><ref name="CMT" /> The album's fifth track, "[[Set Fire to the Rain]]" was written with producer [[Fraser T. Smith]]. The song describes the contradictory elements of a relationship, and the impossibility of letting go.<ref name="Track by Track" /> One of the most pop-influenced of the album,<ref name="MTVUK" /> the 80's-styled "[[power ballad]]"<ref name="OMH" /> features a steady mid-tempo rhythm and swelling chords,<ref name="Failure" /> climaxing with Adele repeating the phrase "let it burn" against a [[wall of sound]],<ref name="Wall" /><ref name= "ripcord" /> created by a swirling strings arrangement.<ref name= "ripcord" /><ref name="Consequence of Sound" /> The sixth track, the Rick Rubin-produced "He Won<U+2019>t Go" features more R&B undertones. John Murphy of MusicOMH compares Adele to [[Mary J. Blige]] in her prime,<ref name="OMH" /> while Aamir Yaqub, writing for ''Soul Culture'' praised the distinctiveness and "catchiness" of the [[harp]] and [[bass]], and notes aural similarities between "He Won<U+2019>t Go" and "Tell Him" by [[Lauryn Hill]].<ref name="Soul Culture" /> The seventh track "Take It All", which incorporates a more soulful gospel sound, is accompanied by a choir and piano. Written with [[Eg White|Francis "Eg" White]], who worked with Adele on "Chasing Pavements", the song's lyrics focus on the protagonist's devotion to an unappreciative lover.<ref name="Together" /><ref name="Track by Track" /> The upbeat "I<U+2019>ll Be Waiting", the eight track, discusses the singer's resilience and the rekindling of a lost love.<ref name="Track by Track" /> 
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="The entire record is more grown up and mature and sincere. And like that lyric from "Someone Like You" ["I wish nothing but the best for you"]...You can't hold grudges forever. It just weighs you down. And that's just something I'm learning in the last year while I've been recovering from everything that happened. And I feel better for it. I feel lighter and healthier for not dwelling on things too much."<ref name="Track by Track" />}}

One of the only love songs not written about her ex was "One and Only." The song, which dares a love interest to take a chance on a relationship, is aimed at a friend for whom Adele had always cared about.<ref name="Track by Track" /> "Lovesong", a bossa-nova style<ref name= "Monitor" /> remake of the song by [[The Cure]], received mixed critical reception from critics. It was inspired by Adele finding solace in her mother and friends while feeling lonely.<ref name="Track by Track" /> The album then closes with "[[Someone Like You (Adele song)|Someone Like You]]", which Adele describes as the summation of her attitude towards the relationship.<ref name="Track by Track" /> A slow, plaintive ballad pairing Adele's voice with a lulling piano, "Someone Like You" is the lyrical opposite of "Rolling in the Deep"<ref name="Track by Track" /> wherein the singer narrates returning to her ex to wish him happiness, and express her desire for finding someone just like him.<ref name="Track by Track" /> One of the more acclaimed songs on the album, pop critics praise its introspective lyrics and "mature" outlook.<ref name="MTVUK" /><ref name="Pitchfork" />

==Marketing and promotion==
[[File:Adele.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Adele performing in 2007.]]
Adele had already developed a fan-base in Britain from the success of her first album, winning the [[BRIT Awards]] ''Critics' Choice'' in 2008, and named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual [[BBC]] poll of music critics, [[Sound of 2008]].<ref name="Billboard Cover" /> In the months leading up to the album's European release, Adele did a number of performances and interviews on various television programmes and music events across Europe, including Britain's ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' on 9 December 2010, [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Live Lounge]] on 27 January, and the finale of ''[[The Voice of Holland]]'', a reality singing competition in [[The Netherlands]], on 21 January 2011. During the week of the album's UK release on 24 January at London's [[Tabernacle, Notting Hill|Tabernacle]], she performed an acoustic set of a number of songs from ''21'', which was screened live on her personal website.<ref name="Billboard Cover" /> The major push came in the wake of the BRIT awards, where Adele's emotional performance<ref name="mighty" /> of "[[Someone Like You (Adele song)|Someone Like You]]" propelled both ''19'' and ''21'', and "Someone Like You" and "[[Rolling in the Deep]]" into the top five of the UK album and singles charts, a feat not accomplished since 1964 by [[The Beatles]].<ref name= "HDD" />

Adele's appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 2008 as well as her [[Grammy Award]] wins for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2009 led to consistent sale of her first album, culminating in a platinum certification by the [[RIAA]] by the time ''21'' was released in the U.S.<ref name="Million" /> For the album's release in the U.S., Columbia executives decided to use the "[[Long Tail Theory|long tail]]" sales theory'<ref name="Billboard Cover" /> as a means of shaping ''21''{{'}}s campaign,"building a critical mass throughout February in order to reach all those people who bought ''19'' over a span of 18 months."<ref name="Billboard Cover" /> The promotion campaign began int he summer of 2010, with appearances on [[CMT]] with Darius Rucker, where she performed Lady Antebellum<U+2019>s <U+201C>[[Need You Now]]<U+201D> and an October showcase at L.A.<U+2019>s Largo for music supervisors.<ref name= "HDD" /> Columbia senior VP of marketing Scott Greer stated that the record company went to some of their key internet partners such as [[Vevo]], [[AOL]] and [[VH1]] to begin playing and advertising both her old and new material.<ref name="Billboard Cover" /> Celebrity bloggers, including [[Perez Hilton]] also contributed to Adele's campaign through repeated promotion.<ref name="Billboard Cover" /> Beginning 1 February, Adele's personal site hosted a "21 Days of Adele"<ref name="Days" /> promotion with exclusive daily content, including a live chat and a video of Adele explaining the inspiration for each album track.<ref name="Billboard Cover" />

Small shows in [[New York]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Minneapolis]] reintroduced the singer to the American public. The week of release was also accompanied by a spate of TV appearances on many American daytime and late night talk shows, such as the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' on 18 February, ''[[Late Show With David Letterman]]'' on 21 February,<ref name="David" /> ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on 24 February.<ref name="CMT" /><ref name="Billboard Cover" /> Additionally, "Rolling in the Deep" was featured in the trailers for the 2011 sci-fi film ''[[I Am Number Four (film)|I Am Number Four]]''.<ref name="Billboard Cover" />

Adele has embarked on her second concert tour [[Adele Live]] in support of ''21'', performing sixty shows across Europe and North America. A number of venues had to be rescheduled to larger arenas due to high ticket demand. 

===Singles===

Upon its release, ''21'' received generally positive reviews from music critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album had a score of 75 based on 33 reviews, which indicates "generally positive reviews".<ref name="Metacritic" /> Many reviews celebrate ''21'' as an artistic leap from her debut both in its production and songwriting.<ref name= "urb" /><ref name="NME" /><ref name="Tribune" /> While both albums explore similar themes, critics generally had considered ''19'' vocally and lyrically subdued,<ref name="OMH" /><ref name= "ripcord" /><ref name="RS Review" /> with the singer's "wandering vocals"<ref name="Paste Mag" /> underpinned by sparse production.<ref name="Paste Mag" /> Ryan Reed of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' also commented that, with the exception of "[[Chasing Pavements]]", songs on ''19'' were "lazy" and "eschew hooks in favor of coffee-house atmosphere".<ref name="Paste Mag" /> However, ''21'' presents a more intense, daring and progressive side to the singer.<ref name="guardian" /> Comparing both her albums, Barry Walters, writing for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', comments "[On ''21''], she wails harder and writes bolder, piling on the dramatic production flourishes to suggest a lover's apocalypse."<ref name="Spin" /> Greg Kot of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also states that "In contrast to the folk-based songs of the first album, ''21'' beefs up the rhythmic drive and the drama of the arrangements."<ref name="Tribune" /> 

Giving the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, John Murphy, writing for [[MusicOMH]], compares Adele to [[Amy Winehouse]], contending that "Almost every song oozes pain, sadness and anger".<ref name="OMH" /> Murphy concludes his review by proclaiming ''21'' "one of the great 'break-up' albums, and the first truly impressive record of 2011."<ref name="OMH" /> Joseph Viney, staff critic for [[Sputnikmusic]], states that ''21'' exhibits influences from many great female artists: "Adele has combined the best bits of [[Aretha Franklin]]<U+2019>s old-school soul with [[Lauryn Hill]]<U+2019>s sass and sense of cynical modern [[femininity]]."<ref name="Sputnik" /> Ian Walker of [[AbsolutePunk]] called the album a "pop masterpiece", although declaring that the album "fails to fully ride the tidal wave created by its first half",<ref name="AbsolutePunk" /> while Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote "''21'' is that rarest pop commodity: timeless."<ref name="ew" />

Adele received almost unanimous praise for her vocal range, power<ref name="NYDN" /> and versatility,<ref name="Lamb, Bill" /><ref name="bbc review" /><ref name="heraldsun" /><ref name="Yahoo Review" /><ref name="Washington Post" /> with Ryan Reed of ''Paste'' describing her voice as "a raspy, aged-beyond-its-years thing of full-blooded beauty."<ref name="Paste Mag" /> Bernadette McNulty of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' opined, "hers is a voice that seems to go right to your heart".<ref name="telegraph" /> Matt Collar of [[Allmusic]] agreed, calling her voice "spine-tingling",<ref name="Allmusic Review" /> while Tom Townshend of [[MSN Music]] declared Adele "the finest singer of [our] generation."<ref name="MSN" /> However, according to a number of reviewers, Adele's vocal prowess was also symptomatic of one of the album's shortcomings: Greg Kot of ''Chicago Tribune'', Allision Stewart of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and Matthew Cole of [[Slant Magazine]] suggest that the compelling nature of Adele's vocals sometimes masked the "blandness",<ref name="slant" /> and mediocrity of many of the songs on the album,<ref name="slant" /> with Stewart commenting, "after a strong start, the disc yields to a forgettable midsection of mostly mid-tempo tracks that are remarkable only because Adele is singing them",<ref name="Washington Post" /> while Cole dismissed many of the songs themselves as "outright intolerable".<ref name="slant" />

===Chart performance===
On 30 January 2011, the album debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] with first week sales of 208,000 copies, making it the biggest-selling January release in five years since [[Arctic Monkeys]]' ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' in 2006.<ref name="Comes of age" /><ref name="Dominates" /> On 13 February 2011, in its third consecutive week at number one, the album sold 134,000 copies, outselling the top five combined.<ref name="Retains No 1" /> Following her performance at the 2011 [[BRIT Awards]] ''21'' experienced a sales surge of 890% on Amazon.co.uk within an hour of the show's broadcast,<ref name="Metro Sales" /> while her first album also saw an incremental rise in sales, jumping from number six to number four on the albums chart.<ref name="Beatles" /> "Someone Like You" also rose from number forty-seven to number one on the UK Singles Chart, while "Rolling in the Deep" ascended from five to four. Adele the first living act since [[The Beatles]] in 1964 to have two UK top five album and singles simultaneously.<ref name="Beatles" /> In ''21''{{'}}s fifth consecutive week at number one, Adele held the top two places in the album chart, the first act to do so since [[The Corrs]] in 1999.<ref name="Fifth Week" /><ref name="Tightens Grip" />

In the coming weeks, the album maintained its high sales, never dipping below 100,000 copies until its twelfth week.<ref name="Billboard Return" /> On 3 April 2011, in its tenth week at number one, a [[Mother's Day]] sales boost pushed ''21'' to its strongest sales week of 258,000<ref name="10th Week" /> ''21'' overtook Madonna's 1990 compilation ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' for the most consecutive weeks at number one by a solo female artist.<ref name="11facts" /> In its eleventh week, the album became the longest-running consecutive number-one album since [[Bob Marley and The Wailers]]' ''Legend'' in 1984. ''21'' was set to overtake Marley's record, but was displaced from the top spot the following week by the [[Foo Fighters]]' ''[[Wasting Light]]''.<ref name="BBC Entertainment" /><ref name="Foo" /> ''21'' regained the number one position the following week,<ref name="BBC Newsbeat" /> and on 8 May 2011, celebrated its fourteenth week at number one on the UK albums chart. On 15 May 2011 the album remained at the top spot, bringing her total weeks at number one up to 15. As of 22 April 2011, the album has been certified eight-times platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for shipments of 2.4 million units, as well as being the most downloaded album in UK.<ref name="BPI" /><ref name="bbcnews" /><ref name="Business" /><ref name="radio1" />. 

Outside of the UK the album has also enjoyed commercial success, topping the charts in 10 countries.<ref name="11facts" /> In the Netherlands the album debuted at number one, and topped the Dutch album chart for fifteen weeks.<ref name="de Vrieze" /> In Germany, ''21'' topped the chart for three months.<ref name="media-control.de" /> As of 22 April, the album has spent a total of 11 weeks at the top of the [[Irish Albums Chart]].

The album sold 352,000 copies in its debut week in the U.S.,<ref name="billboard.com" /> the highest debut of 2011 so far.<ref name="Billboard 200" /> Since its February release, it has remained in the top three, and has returned to number one after being knocked off by [[Lupe Fiasco]]'s ''[[Lasers (album)|Lasers]]'' in the week ending 22 March, [[Britney Spears]]' ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (14 April)<ref name="Fatale" /> and Foo Fighter's ''Wasting Light'' (28 April).<ref name="Waste" /><ref name= "Resilient" /> In its sixth week at number one, ''21'' became the fifth album by a female artist in the last ten years to amass six or more weeks at number-one, joining [[Taylor Swift]]s' ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (11 weeks) and ''[[Speak Now]]'' (six), [[Norah Jones]]' ''[[Feels Like Home]]'' and [[Susan Boyle]]'s ''[[I Dreamed a Dream (album)|I Dreamed a Dream]]'' (both with six weeks).<ref name="Sixth Week" /> The following week, ''21'' topped the ''Billboard'' 200 chart for a total of seven weeks, achieving the second-longest run atop the chart for an album by a female artist since 2000; only Taylor Swift's ''Fearless'' with eleven weeks, has spent longer.<ref name="Seven Weeks" /> In April 2011, ''21'' became the first album to sell one million copies in 2011 in the U.S.<ref name="Yahoo 10 April" /><ref name ="tralala" /> The album has registered sales of over 1.5 million copies.<ref name="Sixth Week" />

====Impact====
The album's success led Joseph Viney of [[Sputnikmusic]] to characterize Adele as the new bearer of British soul music.<ref name="Sputnik" /> In an era of the waning success of the pool of British female solo singers such as [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]], and [[Lily Allen]], Viney states that Adele has emerged as the frontrunner: "Amy Winehouse disappeared in a haze of smoke, Lily Allen took the money and ran whilst [[Kate Nash]] and Duffy dropped off the radar after two poorly received second albums. Adele has been given a clear runway and the chance to stake her claim as the UK<U+2019>s leading solo female artist."<ref name="Sputnik" /> John Murphy of MusicOMH describes Adele as "manna from heaven from those looking (musically at least) for 'the new [[Amy Winehouse]]' back in 2008", contending that "[''21''] is a timely reminder that British soul hasn't lost its mojo."<ref name="OMH" /> 
According to Guy Adams of ''[[The Independent]]'', ''21''{{'}}s success signals the reemergence of the more traditional approach to commercial success: <blockquote>There are two approaches to the business of being noticed by today's record-buying public. The first, showcased by [[Lady Gaga]] at the recent Grammys, revolves around oodles of hype and ever-more preposterous wardrobe selections. The second, adopted by Adele at this year's BRITs, is more understated: it requires a simple black dress and the confidence to let your music do the talking... Amazingly, given preconceived notions about America's supposed preference for style over substance, it is the second of these two sales techniques which appears to be working better."<ref name= "Approach" /></blockquote>
Ethan Smith writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' states that Adele's "deliberately unflashy" nature and full figure has given her a lucrative niche in the market,<ref name= "Approach" /><ref name="Wallstreet" /> and her tendency to emphasize "substance over style", makes her the "Anti-[[Lady Gaga]]".<ref name="Wallstreet" /> Columbia/Epic Label Group Chairman Rob Stringer says of Adele's success: "Adele is the real deal... She writes, is a fantastic singer and in total control... It just goes to show you don<U+2019>t have to sell your soul to be successful... the public responds when it gets something authentic."<ref name= "HDD" />
