==Tectonic setting==
The Kanto area lies above a complex part of the [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]] between the [[subduction|subducting]] [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Philippine Sea Plate]]s and the overriding [[Eurasian Plate]]. Earthquakes with epicenters in the Kanto region may occur within the Eurasian Plate, at the Eurasaian Plate/Philippine Sea Plate interface, within the Philippine Sea Plate, at the Philippine Sea Plate/Pacific Plate interface or within the Pacific Plate. In addition to this set of major plates it has been suggested that there is also a separate 25 km thick, 100 km wide body, a fragment of Pacific Plate [[lithosphere]].<ref name="Toda">{{cite journal|last=Toda|first=S.|coauthors=Stein R.S., Kirby S.H. & Bozkurt S.B.|year=2008|title=A slab fragment wedged under Tokyo and its tectonic and seismic implications|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|pages=771<U+2013>776|doi=10.1038/ngeo318|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n11/abs/ngeo318.html|accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref> The 1855 earthquake is consistent with a rupture along the interface between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates, adjacent to, and down dip from, the rupture that caused the [[1923 Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]].<ref name="Bakun">{{cite journal|last=Bakun|first=W.H.|year=2005|title=Magnitude and location of historical earthquakes in Japan and implications for the 1855 Ansei Edo earthquake|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=110|issue=B02304|doi=10.1029/2004JB003329|url=http://sicarius.wr.usgs.gov/tokyo/submitted/Bakun_JGR_revised8Nov2004.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref>

==Damage==
A total of about 50,000 houses and over 50 temples were either destroyed by the earthquake shaking or subsequent fires.<ref name="NGDC_EQ"/>  The area burned down in Edo was about 2.3 km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Enomoto"/>

==Characteristics==
The earthquake was followed by 78 [[aftershock]]s in the first month.<ref name="Bakun"/>

==Aftermath==
Two days after the earthquake, prints began to appear, with more than 400 different types being available in the following weeks. Most of the prints depicted giant [[catfish]], a type of image known as [[Namazu (Japanese mythology)|Namazu-e]]. The significance being that earthquakes at the time were popularly attributed to the thrashing about of a mythological catfish under the earth, normally kept under control by the deity Kashima using a large rock.<ref name=smitts/> The number of prints produced during the 1855 earthquake was unprecedented and has been related to the political and social effects of the disaster. The prints show the people's anger with Kashima who became replaced by the solar deity [[Amaterasu]]. Some of the prints also depict the redistribution of wealth. The earthquake has been described as an act of ''yonaoshi'' or 'world rectification', in the light of the two [[1854 Ansei-T<U+014D>kai earthquake|great]] [[1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake|earthquakes]] of 1854 and the arrival of [[Matthew C. Perry|Perry's]] [[Black Ships]] in 1853.<ref name=smitts/>

===Era of Disaster===
Three large earthquakes, the [[1854 Ansei-T<U+014D>kai earthquake]], [[1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake]], and the 1855 Ansei Edo earthquake are collectively called the [[Ansei Great Earthquakes]] (<U+5B89><U+653F><U+306E><U+5927><U+5730><U+9707>, ''Ansei no Dai Jishin'').   Combining the effects of these disasters with a major cholera outbreak killing over 100,000 people, a fire at [[Edo Castle]], and the [[1858 Hietsu earthquake]], the [[Ansei]] era was one of quite catastrophic upheaval.  Due to the cumulative effects of these disasters, the reign name was changed in 1860 to usher in a 'clean slate' and better "fortune".{{Citation needed|Jan 2011}}
