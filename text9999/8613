"'''Jihad'''" is a song by the [[United States|American]] [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], and appears on their 2006 album ''[[Christ Illusion]]''. The track portrays the imagined viewpoint of a terrorist who has participated in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], concluding with spoken lyrics taken from words left behind by [[Mohammed Atta]]; Atta was named by the FBI as the "head suicide terrorist" of the first plane to crash into the World Trade Center. "Jihad" was primarily written by guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]]; the lyrics were co-authored with vocalist [[Tom Araya]].

"Jihad" received a mixed reception in the music press, and reviews generally focused on the lyrics' controversial subject matter. The song drew comparisons to Slayer's 1986 track "[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]&mdash;also penned by Hanneman&mdash;which similarly caused outrage at the time of its release. 

Joseph Dias of the [[Mumbai]] Christian group "Catholic Secular Forum" expressed concern over "Jihad"'s lyrics, and contributed to ''Christ Illusion'''s recall by [[EMI]] India, who to date have no plans for a reissue in that country. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s Broadcast Standards and Practices Department censored the song during Slayer's first US network television appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]].'' Only the opening minute was broadcast over the show's credits, thus omitting 40% of the lyrics.

==Origins==
[[Image:Mohamed Atta.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Mohamed Atta]], who left behind a "motivational" letter following the September 11, 2001 attacks.

American Recordings, 9362-44300-2</ref> Both Hanneman and Araya had previously written about controversial lyrical matter in past Slayer tracks; while Hanneman had written songs like "[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]" and "SS-3" which explored the atrocities committed by Nazi figures such as Auschwitz concentration camp physician Josef Mengele and Third Reich henchman [[Reinhard Heydrich]], Araya had delved into the lives of serial killers such as [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and [[Ed Gein]] in the tracks "213" and "Dead Skin Mask" respectively. "Jihad" is written from the perspective of a 9/11 terrorist, and imagines the thoughts that "the enemy" might have.<ref name="KingAtkinson">{{cite web|title=Songs About God and Satan - Part 1: An Interview With Slayer's Kerry King|author=Atkinson, Peter|publisher=KNAC.com|date=[[2006-05-24]]|url=http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4550|accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref><ref name="SunInterview">{{cite web | title = It's carry on thrashing'|author=|publisher=The Sun Online|date=|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2006380348,00-2006370167,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The climax of the song features spoken text taken from a motivational letter left behind by [[Mohamed Atta]],<ref name="KingAtkinson"/> who was named by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as the head suicide terrorist of [[American Airlines Flight 11]], the first plane to crash into the [[World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

Guitarist [[Kerry King]] has been outspoken in his defense of "Jihad", and has claimed that the song has the "coolest angle" on ''Christ Illusion''.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/> "These new songs aren't political at all," King states, "'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' <U+2014> it's what's spewing out at us from the TV."<ref>{{cite web|title=After 25 years, Slayer keeps casting metal|author=Beck, Aaron|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|date=[[2007-02-10]]|url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/features-story.php?story=dispatch/2007/02/10/20070210-B1-02.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorists' perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, although he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/> They did not wish to dwell on the topic "because every band on the planet already has" and "came from a certain perspective", so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/> "We're Slayer, we have to be different" was King's assertion.<ref name="KingAtkinson"/>

American singer/songwriter [[Steve Earle]] attempted a similar concept in penning "John Walker's Blues" (from the 2002 album ''[[Jerusalem (album)|Jerusalem]]''), written from the perspective of the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-born [[John Walker Lindh]], a [[Taliban]] member captured during the 2001 US-led [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|invasion of Afghanistan]].<ref name="KingAtkinson"/><ref name="Sculley">{{cite web|title=Metal gods Slayer gear up for this summer's most brutal road trek, the Unholy Alliance Tour|author=Sculley, Alan|publisher =CityBeat.com|date =|url=http://www.citybeat.com/2006-06-14/music.shtml|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Earle was criticised for this track; King anticipated a comparable reaction to "Jihad":<ref name="KingAtkinson"/><ref name="Sculley"/> "People make an assumption before they (read) the lyrics.

[[IGN]] reviewer Andy Patrizio was dismissive of the song's musical structure in comparison to other tracks on ''Christ Illusion'':  "'Jihad,' 'Flesh Storm,' 'Skeleton Christ,' 'Supremist,' and felt there was too much similarity in the riffs, tuning, [[tempos]], and [[arrangements]]."<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Patrizio, Andy|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2006-08-14]]|url= http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/725/725459p1.html|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> [[MusicOMH.com]]'s Ian Robinson was also negative, remarking that the song "concludes with the 'now getting slightly old hat' Slayer trick (but still atmospheric) of over sampling voices over the solo."<ref name="MusicOMH">{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Robinson, Ian|publisher=[[MusicOMH.com]]|date=[[2006-08-21]]|url= http://www.musicomh.com/albums/slayer_0806.htm|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

==Reception and criticism==
"Jihad"<U+2014>alongside fellow ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' album tracks "[[Eyes of the Insane]]" and "Cult"<U+2014>was made available for streaming on [[June 26]], [[2006 in music|2006]], via the [[Spain|Spanish]] website ''Rafabasa.com''.<ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER: Three New Tracks Available In Streaming Audio|author=|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=[[2006-06-26]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54247|accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref> The album was Slayer's ninth [[studio album|studio recording]], and was released on [[August 8]] [[2006]]. During reviews "Jihad" received a mixed reception.

''[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]]'''s Don Kaye gave the opinion that "a handful of songs" on ''Christ Illusion'' "are either too generic or the arrangements are too clumsy to work well", and specifically singled out the track: "I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'"<ref name="BlabbermouthReview">{{cite web|title = Blabbermouth Review - ''Christ Illusion''|author=Kaye, Don|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=817|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Ben Ratliff of ''[[New York Times]]'' remarked that the song is "predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than [[Martin Amis]]'s recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda."<ref name="NYTReview"/> Peter Atkinson of ''KNAC.com'' was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as:<ref name="KNACReview">{{cite web|title=KNAC Review - Christ Illusion|author=Atkinson, Peter|publisher=KNAC.com|date=[[2006-07-24]]|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4789|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

{{cquotetxt|..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for <U+201C>difficult<U+201D> subjects in the past <U+2014> Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in <U+201D>[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]<U+201D> or [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]/[[Ed Gein]]'s ghoulish proclivities in <U+201C>213<U+201D> and "[[Seasons in the Abyss|Dead Skin Mask]]" <U+2014> with great effect. But here it feels atypically crass and exploitative, as if it was done purely to get a rise out of people... And Slayer's usually a lot more clever than that.}}

Not all reviews were so negative. Thom Jurek of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' observed that "the band begins to enter and twist and turn looking for a place to create a new rhythmic thrash that's the most insane deconstruction of four/four time on tape."<ref name="AllMusicReview" /> The ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'''s Marc Savlov asked readers to "listen to the eerie, stop-start cadence of lunacy in "Jihad," with Araya essaying the role of a suicide bomber almost too convincingly."<ref>{{cite web|title= Christ Illusion - Review|author=Savlov, Marc|publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=[[2006-09-01]]|url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid:399559|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> 

King would have appointed "Jihad" as the group's nomination in the "[[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]]" award category at the [[49th Grammy Awards]], deeming the chosen track "[[Eyes of the Insane]]" "the poorest representations" of the group on ninth studio album ''Christ Illusion''.<ref>{{cite news | last = Piccoli| first = Sean| title =Grammy for Slayer's 11th album shows metal legends are now a household name| work =| pages =| publisher = Sun-Sentinel.com  | date = 2007-02-21  | url =|accessdate=}}</ref> Despite King's statement, "Eyes of the Insane" won Slayer their first Grammy award.<ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER Wins GRAMMY In 'Best Metal Performance' Category|author=|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=[[2007-02-11]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=66845|accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> The Slayer guitarist has also stated; "I like playing 'Jihad' because I'm back changing my guitars, and Jeff starts it and he starts it quietly so you can hear the fans go crazy about it and you can't always here that at the beginning of a song."<ref>{{cite web|title= Slayer Interview Pt II|author=Gamble, Billy|publisher=Rocknworld.com|date=|url= http://www.rocknworld.com/features/07/slayer2.shtml|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

"Jihad"'s lyrical matter provoked controversy from several quarters.
