In [[Beijing]], authorities halted renovation projects similar to the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after the blaze. The projects, intended to save energy by installing insulation, were stopped on 19 November, pending safety evaluations of the work. The insulation is still flammable, despite the use of fire retardants. Shanghai officials temporarily stopped such renovations after the fire, but later allowed them to resume.<ref name="ABC blame">{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=12188489&page=1|title=Shanghai Fire Toll at 58; Beijing Reviews Projects|last=Kurtenbach|first=Elaine|work=[[ABC News]]|date=19 November 2010|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>

On 20 December 2010, the mayor of Shanghai, [[Han Zheng]], said that the city would crack down on unfair practices of construction companies and contracting firms.

===Media censorship allegations===
Hong Kong-based ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' and Singapore-based ''[[Lianhe Zaobao]]'' reported that four journalists from ''Xinjing News'' (<U+65B0><U+4EAC><U+62A5>), ''[[China Daily]]'', ''[[Reuters]]'' and a local newspaper were detained for one hour as security forces demanded a guarantee for positive news coverage by the journalists, before they were to interview families of the victims at a funeral parlour.<ref name="zaobao1">{{cite news|url=http://www.zaobao.com/wencui/2010/11/hongkong101119o.shtml|title=<U+56DB><U+8BB0><U+8005><U+4E0A><U+6D77><U+91C7><U+8BBF><U+88AB><U+4FDD><U+5B89><U+6263><U+7559>|date=19 November 2010|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.|work=[[Lianhe Zaobao]]|language=Chinese|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> The reporters wrote about their detainment on two websites.<ref name="NYTcensor" />

==Responsibility==
Han Zheng said on 22 November that the city was largely responsible for the disaster. He said, "Poor supervision of the city's construction industry was one of the causes behind the high-rise apartment building fire. And we are responsible for that."<ref name="Xinhua comp" /> Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a professor at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], said Han was trying "to do some damage control to dispel anger and to comfort the families of the victims and the Shanghai people."<ref name="Bloomberg comp" /> Luo Lin, chief of China's [[State Administration of Work Safety]], blamed the fire on illegal employment methods, poor project oversight, and incompetent, inexperienced workers.<ref name="PD blame" /><ref name="ABC blame" />

On the day following the fire, Meng Jianzhu said he wanted an investigation into the fire to determine who was responsible for it, so those at fault could be punished appropriately. He told rescue officials to be meticulous in their efforts and that information regarding the fire should be released to the public. He also asked local governments across China to take preventative measures against such fires, including building inspections.<ref name=xinhua4 /> A team of investigators, led by the State Administration of Work Safety,<ref name="PD blame">{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/7202743.html|title=Illegal work practices behind Shanghai high-rise fire: work safety chief|date=17 November 2010|work=[[People's Daily]]|publisher=People's Daily Online|author=Xinhua|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref> was formed under [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|China's State Council]] to look into the incident.<ref name="xinhua5">{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-11/16/c_13608088.htm|title=Investigation team set up for Shanghai high-rise fire|date=16 November 2010|work=Xinhua|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Many details about the "November&nbsp;15 Relief and Rehabilitation Working Team" have not been publicly announced.<ref name="Global Times" />

The investigation into the fire made a preliminary conclusion that negligence by unlicensed welders on the tenth floor caused the bamboo scaffolding and attached nylon netting to catch fire, which subsequently spread to the entire structure. Shanghai authorities detained eight individuals on 16 November, at least four of whom were accused of being unlicensed welders.<ref name=wsj0 /><ref name="reuters0">{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6AF1EJ20101116|title=Eight detained after Shanghai apartment fire kills 53|date=16 November 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> As of 19 November, a total of twelve individuals were being held by officials in connection to the blaze,<ref name="Bloomberg comp" /><ref name="Xinhua comp" /> including four more who were detained that day.

On 24 December 2010, Shanghai officials announced that three government employees had been taken into custody in connection with the fire. Those detained were accused of abusing their authority to permit illicit construction practices to occur. The three were reported to be Gao Weizhong, director of Jing'an's construction and transportation commission; Zhang Quan, of the commission's main office; and Zhou Jianmin, of the organization's construction department.<ref name="NYT24Dec" /><ref name="Global Times">{{cite news|url=http://special.globaltimes.cn/2010-12/604732.html|title=No smoke without fire|work=[[Global Times]]|publisher=Global Times|date=28 December 2010|last=Liu|first=Dong|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="COCNDetain" />

===Cause of fire===
The fire may have been caused by the accidental ignition of [[polyurethane]] foam insulation used on the building's outer walls.<ref name="Global Times" /><ref name="Eastday comp" /> In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of [[flame retardant]]s, and the foam produces toxic gases and [[carbon monoxide]] when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a [[Beijing Television Cultural Center fire|2009 fire]] that consumed the center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mingpaotor.com/htm/News/20101117/tcaa3.htm|title=<U+4FDD><U+6EAB><U+6750><U+6599><U+7591><U+6210><U+52A9><U+71C3><U+5668>|date=16 November 2010|work=Ming Pao Daily News|publisher=Ming Pao Enterprise Corporation Ltd.|language=Chinese|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be replaced switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials.<ref name="Compensation" /> Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor [[fire sprinkler system]] in high rise buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/world/asia/17shanghai.html?_r=2&ref=china|title=Fire Trips Alarms About China<U+2019>s Building Boom; Censors Respond|date=16 November 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=23 November 2010}}</ref>
