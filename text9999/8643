The '''Mass Rapid Transit''' or '''MRT''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: <U+5927><U+4F17><U+5FEB><U+901F><U+4EA4><U+901A> or more commonly known as <U+5730><U+94C1>; [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Sistem Pengangkutan Gerak Cepat''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: <U+0B9A><U+0BBF><U+0B99><U+0BCD><U+0B95><U+0BC8> <U+0BA4><U+0BC1><U+0BB0><U+0BBF><U+0BA4><U+0B95><U+0BCD> <U+0B95><U+0B9F><U+0BB5><U+0BC1> <U+0BB0><U+0BAF><U+0BBF><U+0BB2><U+0BCD>) is a [[rapid transit]] system that forms the backbone of the [[Rail transport in Singapore|railway system]] in [[Singapore]] with a network spanning the entire city-state. The initial section of the MRT, between [[Yio Chu Kang MRT Station|Yio Chu Kang]] and [[Toa Payoh MRT Station|Toa Payoh]], was opened in 1987, establishing the MRT as the second oldest metro system in [[Southeast Asia]] after [[Manila]]'s [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|LRT System]].

The network has since grown rapidly as a result of Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the main backbone of the [[Public transport in Singapore|public transport system in Singapore]]. In 2005, the average daily ridership on the MRT network was about 1.338 million. While this figure pales in comparison to the [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus network's]] 2.785 million, it was nonetheless an 76% increase compared to figures in 1995 (0.760 million), while the bus network saw a 8.1% drop in ridership in the same period.<ref>[http://www.lta.gov.sg/corp_info/doc/Average%20Daily%20Public%20Transport%20Ridership.pdf? "Singapore Land Transport: Average Public Transport Ridership"], [[Land Transport Authority]], Retrieved [[14 October]] [[2006]]</ref> This trend is expected to continue as current public transport policies promote the expansion of the rail network at the expense of bus services which are withdrawn or reduced to avoid duplication of services. 

The MRT has [[List of Singapore MRT stations|64 operating stations]] with 109.4 kilometres of lines, and operates on [[standard gauge]]. The rail lines have been constructed by the [[Land Transport Authority]], a department of the [[government of Singapore]], which allocates operating concessions to the profit-based corporations [[SMRT Corporation]] and [[SBS Transit]]. These operators also run bus and [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi services]], thus ensuring that there is a full integration of [[Transport in Singapore|public transport services]]. The MRT is complemented by the regional [[Light Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Light Rapid Transit]] (LRT) systems which links the MRT stations with the respective [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] [[public housing|public]] [[housing estates]] they serve.<ref>[http://www.mot.gov.sg/white_paper.html "A World-Class Land Transport System" (Online summary version)], [[Land Transport Authority]], Retrieved [[7 December]] [[2005]]</ref> Services operate from about 5:30 [[12-hour clock|am]] and usually end before 1 a.m. daily with frequencies of approximately five minutes, and services being extended during [[Holidays in Singapore|festive periods]].

{{main|History of the Mass Rapid Transit}}

The origins of the Mass Rapid Transit are derived from a forecast by city planners in 1967 which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system by 1992.<ref> {{cite paper | url = http://csur.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ws2004/papers/B2-Fwa.pdf | author = Tien Fang Fwa | title = SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT &mdash; Issues and Challenges for Singapore | date = [[September 4|4 September]] [[2004]]|accessdate= 2006-05-01 |publisher = [[University of Tokyo]] }} </ref> Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, the Parliament came to the conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate, since it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country. The initial [[Singapore dollar|S$]]5 billion construction of the Mass Rapid Transit network was Singapore's largest public works project at the time, starting on [[22 October]] [[1983]] at Shan Road. The network was built in stages, with the [[North South MRT Line|North South Line]] given priority because it passed through the [[Central Area]] that has a high demand for public transport. The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation<U+2014>MRTC, later called the [[SMRT Corporation]]<U+2014>was established on [[14 October]] [[1983]]; it took over the roles and responsibilities of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority.<ref>[http://www.lta.gov.sg/public_transport/pt_rail_tracing.htm "1982 - The Year Work Began"], [[Land Transport Authority]], Retrieved [[7 December]] [[2005]]</ref> On [[7 November]] [[1987]], the first section of the North South Line started operations, consisting of five stations over six kilometres. Fifteen more stations were later opened, and the MRT system was officially launched on [[12 March]] [[1988]] by [[Lee Kuan Yew]], then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]]. Another 21 stations were subsequently added to the system; the opening of [[Boon Lay MRT Station|Boon Lay]] station on the [[East West MRT Line|East West Line]] on [[6 July]] [[1990]] marked the completion of the system two years ahead of schedule.

The Mass Rapid Transit has subsequently been expanded. This includes a S$1.2 billion expansion of the North South Line into Woodlands, completing a continuous loop. The concept of having rail lines that bring people almost directly to their homes led to the introduction of the [[Light Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Light Rapid Transit]] (LRT) system into the existing Mass Rapid Transit network. On [[6 November]] [[1999]], the first LRT trains on the [[Bukit Panjang LRT Line]] went into operation. To promote tourism, the [[Changi Airport MRT Station|Changi Airport]] and [[Expo MRT Station|Expo]] stations were built. The [[North East MRT Line|North East Line]], the first line operated by SBS Transit, opened on [[20 June]] [[2003]] and became one of the first fully automated heavy rail lines in the world.

==Station facilities, amenities and services==
[[Image:MRT-Stationfac.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Concourse level of [[Queenstown MRT Station]], showing a [[plasma display screen]], passenger service centre and faregates.]]
{{main|Facilities on the Mass Rapid Transit}}
All MRT stations are either above-ground or underground except for [[Bishan MRT Station|Bishan]] station, which is at ground level. Most underground stations are deep enough to withstand [[conventional weapons|conventional aerial bomb attacks]] and to serve as [[bomb shelter]]s.<ref>[http://www.scdf.gov.sg/html/info/inf02_shelter.html "Civil Defence Shelter Programme"], [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]], Retrieved [[7 December]] [[2005]]</ref>

Every station has at least four General Ticketing Machines (GTMs), a Passenger Service Centre, [[light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[plasma display]]s that show train service information and announcements. All stations are equipped with restrooms and payphones, although some restrooms are located on street level. Some stations, especially the major ones, have additional amenities and services, such as [[retailer|retail]] shops and kiosks, supermarkets, convenience stores such as [[7-Eleven]] or Cheers, automatic teller machines, and self-service automated kiosks for a variety of services. 

The older stations on the North South Line and East West Line were not originally constructed with fully [[accessibility|accessible]] facilities, such as lifts, ramps, tactile guidance systems and toilets for passengers with [[disability|disabilities]]. However, these facilities are being progressively installed as part of a program to make all stations accessible to the elderly and the those with disabilities.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/75146/1/.html "Tactile tiles to help blind navigate Singapore's MRT stations"], Asha Popatlal, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[12 March]] [[2004]]</ref><ref>[[Land Transport Authority]] et al, ''Journeys'' Issue 42 (Jan/Feb 2003), ''"Get a Lift-up!"'', pg. 10.</ref> As of [[16 September]] [[2006]], all stations with the exception of [[Buona Vista MRT Station|Buona Vista Station]] & [[Bishan MRT Station|Bishan Station]] are barrier free.

==Fares and tickets==
[[Image:Cg1 expo GTM.jpg|thumb|right|275px|General Ticketing Machines (GTM) at [[Expo_MRT_Station|Expo]] station, where commuters can purchase a Standard Ticket, or add value to their [[EZ-Link]] card.]]
{{main|Fares and ticketing on the Mass Rapid Transit}}
Because the rail operators are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched to at least break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on the distance between the start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in [[List of rapid transit systems|other subway systems]], such as the [[London Underground]]. As the fare system has been integrated by [[TransitLink]], commuters need pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates during the entire journey, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference as they exit their destination station.

Stations are divided into two areas, ''paid'' and ''unpaid'', which allow the rail operators to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as ''access control gates''. These gates, connected to a computer network, are capable of reading and updating electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. [[Ticket machine|General Ticketing Machines]] sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to purchase additional value for stored-value tickets.  Tickets for single trips, coloured in green, are valid only on the day of purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time. Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit.

Although operated by private companies, the system's fare structure is regulated by the [[Public Transport Council]], to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce its heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases over the past few years have caused public concern.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/145571/1/.html "Public transport fare hike not justified as SMRT still profitable: CASE"], Yvonne Cheong, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[14 April]] [[2005]]</ref> There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on [[SBS Transit]]'s [[North-East Line|North East line]], a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.<ref>[http://www.ptc.gov.sg/news4.pdf "New NEL Fare Structure Approved], [[Public Transport Council]], [[8 May]] [[2003]]</ref>

===Magnetic tickets (1987&ndash;2002)===
[[Image:Farecard-adult.gif|right|thumb|180px|An example of a standard adult farecard, in use on [[Transport in Singapore|Singapore's transportation system]] between 1987 and 2001. There were many background designs in use.]]
When the MRT first came into operation in 1987, fares ranged from [[Singapore dollar|S$]]0.50 to S$1.10 in S$0.10 increments for all adult tickets, regardless of whether they were single-trip or stored-value tickets. Several discounted fares were available: senior citizens and permanent residents above the age of 60 could travel on a flat fare of S$0.50 during off-peak hours; children below the height of 1.2 metres and full-time students in primary, secondary, pre-university and vocational training (VITB) institutions paid a flat fare of S$0.30 at all times.

[[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic strip plastic tickets]] were used, in various forms. Stored-value tickets were called ''farecards'' and came in three types: the blue farecard was issued to adults, the magenta farecard to senior citizens, and the red farecard to children. Single-trip forms of these tickets were retained at the faregates on exiting the paid area of a destination station. Monthly discounted tickets were available in four values: beige, pink, and purple tickets for primary and tertiary students, and [[National Service in Singapore|full-time national servicemen]] came with a value of S$13, S$30 and S$36, respectively; the peach ticket was for secondary, pre-university and VITB students, costing S$17 each. These discounted tickets were valid for a month from the date of purchase, allowed up to four trips a day, and were non-transferable.

===EZ-Link cards and Standard Tickets (2002&ndash;present)===
{{main|EZ-Link}}

[[Image:EZ-Link.jpg|right|thumb|180px|A standard adult [[EZ-Link]] card.]]
The [[EZ-Link|EZ-Link card]] is a [[contactless]] [[smart card|smartcard]] based on [[Sony]]'s [[FeliCa]] smartcard technology. These cards are used for making payments for some goods and services in Singapore, mainly transportation services. Established in 2002, the technology was promoted as a means for speedy and convenient transactions, and an efficient method of reducing fare evasion, although there have been some cases of overcharging users.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/148570/1/.html "Buses and the not so ez-link"], Ansley Ng, [[Today (newspaper)|Today Online]], [[20 May]] [[2005]]</ref> As a benchmark, fares range from S$0.69 to S$3.04 for adults, S$0.64 to S$0.70 for senior citizens, and S$0.40 to S$0.50 for student EZ-Link cards.

The General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) at each station, replacing older ticket machines, allow commuters to purchase additional credit to add to their EZ-Link cards or to purchase tickets for single trips. Fares for these single-trip forms of these cards range are between one or two times the expense of non single-trip tickets. In addition, a S$1.00 refundable ticket deposit is charged for each Standard Ticket. This refund can be collected from any General Ticketing Machine when the card is returned to the machine within 30 days of purchase. The card can also be left in a charity collection box, thereby donating the S$1.00 deposit. The smartcard technology contained in each Standard Ticket makes each one costly enough to necessitate [[recycling]] of Standard Tickets. Concession fares are available for children, students, senior citizens and national servicemen. The ''Visitor's Card'', which offers a package of services to [[tourism in Singapore|tourists]], can be used as an EZ-Link card.

Students are given free, personalised cards, complete with their photos, names and [[National Registration Identity Card|national identification]] numbers. Regardless of its type, each card is assigned a unique card ID that can be used to recover the card if lost. Transport operators have organised lotteries that are based on these card IDs.

==MRT rolling stock==
[[Image:MRT-NELmetropolis.JPG|thumb|right|275px|The [[France|French]]-manufactured [[Alstom Metropolis Cars]] are the newest rolling stock on the MRT network.]]
: ''Main articles: [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 Cars|C151 Cars]], [[Siemens C651 Cars|C651 Cars]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & Nippon Sharyo C751B Cars|C751B Cars]] and [[Alstom Metropolis Cars]]''

Three types of [[rolling stock]] are used to carry passengers on both the North&ndash;South Line and the East&ndash;West Line. They are powered by 750-volt [[direct current|DC]] [[third rail]], operate in sets of six cars,<ref>[http://www.smrt.com.sg/smrt/train_sys.htm#trains "Train and System Information" (Trains)], [[SMRT Corporation]], Retrieved [[7 November]] [[2005]]</ref> and use the [[automatic train operation]] system (ATO) that is similar to [[London Underground]]'s [[Victoria Line]].

The majority of the fleet comprises 396  [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 Cars|C151 Cars]];<ref name="khi">[http://www.khi.co.jp/sharyo/since_final/since_e.html "Hyogo Works History"], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], retrieved [[19 March]] [[2006]]</ref> these are the oldest trains that are still in operation, as of 2006. They were built between 1986 and 1989 by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] in consortium with [[Nippon Sharyo]], [[Tokyu Car Corporation]] and [[Kinki Sharyo]]. A S$142.7 million upgrade of these trains is under way and will be completed by 2008.<ref>[http://www.todayonline.com/articles/48640.asp "Fair grounds for fare hikes?"], Tor Ching Li, [[Today (newspaper)|Today Online]], [[4 May]] [[2005]]</ref>

In 1994, 114 [[Siemens C651 Cars|C651 Cars]], manufactured by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] of Germany, were purchased to complement the existing fleet of C151 trains when the [[History of the Mass Rapid Transit#North South Line Woodlands Extension|Woodlands extension]] opened.<ref>[http://references.transportation.siemens.com/refdb/showReference.do?r=455&div=5&l=en "References - Metro System, MRTC, Six-Car Units, Singapore"], [[Siemens AG]], Retrieved [[7 December]] [[2005]]</ref> Some of these trains have been previously reconfigured in experimental programs to accommodate more passengers, but such arrangements have since been abandoned.

[[Image:Ulupandandepot.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Trains parked at the bay of the [[Ulu Pandan Depot|Ulu Pandan]] MRT Depot]]

Between 1998 and 2001, 126 [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & Nippon Sharyo C751B Cars|C751B Cars]] built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Nippon Sharyo in a joint venture were introduced. Kawasaki Heavy Industries manufactured 66 cars<ref name="khi" /> and Nippon Sharyo manufactured 60 cars respectively. The cars have a sleeker design and come with an improved passenger information system, more grab poles, wider seats, more space near the doors and spaces for wheelchairs. As these trains were originally intended to operate on a direct service from Boon Lay to [[Changi Airport MRT Station|Changi Airport]], luggage racks were installed for air travellers.<ref>[http://www.smrt.com.sg/news/2002/02_06.html "Commencement of revenue service at Changi Airport Station"], [[SMRT Corporation]] Press Release, [[6 February]] [[2002]]</ref> However, in April 2002 faulty [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearboxes]] forced all 21 train-sets to be off-service, and the service was temporarily suspended.<ref>[http://www.smrt.com.sg/news/2002/04_23b.html "Temporary Suspension of Boon Lay - Changi Airport Through Service"], [[SMRT Corporation]] Press Release, [[23 April]] [[2002]]</ref> The direct service was scrapped in July 2003, and the luggage racks were removed.<ref>[http://www.smrt.com.sg/news/2003/07_17.html "Shuttle Train Service Between Tanah Merah and Changi Airport Stations"], [[SMRT Corporation]] Press Release, [[17 July]] [[2003]]</ref>

Since its opening in 2003, 150 driverless [[Alstom Metropolis Cars]] have been operating on the North East Line. [[Alstom|Alstom Transportation]] of France was contracted by Land Transport Authority in 1997 and 1998 to supply these cars. They are fully automatic, powered by [[overhead lines]] on 1,500 volts DC, and are the first trains to have closed-circuit cameras (CCTV) installed within their interiors. A further order of 120 cars is due to be delivered when the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]] starts operations in 2007.<ref>[http://www.transport.alstom.com/home/Products_and_Services/TURNKEY_SYSTEMS/Urban_turnkey/10963.EN.php?languageId=EN&dir=/home/Products_and_Services/TURNKEY_SYSTEMS/Urban_turnkey/&docLink=7628 "Metropolis in Singapore"], [[Alstom|Alstom Transportation]], Retrieved [[7 November]] [[2005]]</ref><ref>[[Land Transport Authority]] et al, ''Journeys'' Issue 42 (Jan/Feb 2003), ''"Safe, Sound and Fully Automated"'', pg. 8-9.</ref>

===Depots===
SMRT Corporation has 4 train depots: The [[Bishan Depot|Bishan]] depot is the central maintenance depot with train overhaul facilities, while the [[Changi Depot|Changi]] and [[Ulu Pandan Depot|Ulu Pandan]] depots only inspect and house trains overnight. The underground [[Kim Chuan Depot]] houses trains for the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]].<ref>[http://www.smrt.com.sg/smrt/train_sys.htm#stations "Train and System Information" (Stations)], [[SMRT Corporation]], Retrieved [[7 November]] [[2005]]</ref> [[Ang Mo Kio MRT Station|Ang Mo Kio]], [[Jurong East MRT Station|Jurong East]] and [[Tanah Merah MRT Station|Tanah Merah]] stations were built with a third middle track for off-service trains to stop at before they return to their depots, but the last two are now used as termini for the North South Line and the Changi shuttle, respectively.

The [[Sengkang Depot]] houses trains for the [[North East MRT Line|North East Line]], the [[Sengkang LRT Line|Sengkang LRT]] and the [[Punggol LRT Line|Punggol LRT]], all operated by SBS Transit. It is the first depot to have structual provisions for an industrial development located above the depot, to minimize the wastage of land in land-scarce Singapore.

==Architecture and art on the MRT==
[[Image:Ne4chinatownart1.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Chinese Calligraphy]] is integrated into the [[floor|flooring]] of the [[Chinatown MRT Station|Chinatown Station]].]]
[[Image:Cg1 expo exterior.jpg|thumb|275px|Expo MRT Station, sited adjacent to the 100,000 square metre Singapore Expo exhibition facility, sports a futuristic design by [[Foster and Partners]].]]

Early stages of the MRT's construction paid relatively scant attention to station design, with an emphasis on functionality over aesthetics. This is particularly evident in the first few stages of the North&ndash;South Line and the East&ndash;West Line that opened between 1987 and 1988 from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT Station|Yio Chu Kang]] to [[Clementi MRT Station|Clementi]]. Architectural themes became an issue only in subsequent stages, and resulted in such designs as the cylindrical station shapes on most stations between [[Kallang MRT Station|Kallang]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT Station|Pasir Ris]], and the perched roofs on stations to the west of [[Jurong East MRT Station|Jurong East]].

Art pieces, where present, are seldom highlighted; they primarily consist of a few paintings or sculptures representing the recent past of Singapore, mounted in major stations. The opening of the Woodlands Extension introduced bolder pieces of artwork, such as the large hanging sculpture in the [[Woodlands MRT Station]]. With the opening of the North East Line, a series of artworks created under a programme called "The Art In Transit" were commissioned by the Land Transport Authority. Created by 19 local artists and integrated into the stations' interior architecture, these artworks aim to promote the appreciation of [[public art]] in high-traffic environments. The artwork for each station is designed to suit the station's identity. Only stations on the North East Line come under this programme.<ref>[http://www.lta.gov.sg/public_transport/doc/Art%20in%20Transit%20brochure.pdf "Art in Transit brochure"], [[Land Transport Authority]], Retrieved [[7 December]] [[2005]]</ref>

Along the extension to the East-West line connecting to [[Changi Airport MRT Station|Changi Airport]], the Expo Station is sited adjacent to the 100,000 square metre [[Singapore Expo]] exhibition facility. Designed by [[Foster and Partners]] and completed in January 2001, the station features a large pillarless titanium clad roof in an elliptical shape that sheathes the length of the station platform. This complements a smaller 40 metre reflective stainless steel disc overlapping the titanium ellipse and visually floats over a glass elevator shaft and the main entrance.<ref>[http://www.fosterandpartners.com/ "EXPO Station, Singapore, 1997-2000"], [[Foster and Partners]], retrieved [[18 March]] [[2006]].

==Safety on the MRT==
[[Image:Ns24dhobyghaut.jpg|right|thumb|275px|[[Platform screen doors]] at [[Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station|Dhoby Ghaut station]] on the [[North-South Line]].]]
{{main|Safety on the Mass Rapid Transit}}

Assurance has been given by both operators and authorities, that numerous measures have been taken in an effort to ensure the safety of passengers, with SBS Transit having to make greater efforts in actively publicising its safety considerations on the driver-less North East Line before and after its opening.<ref>"Measures in place to ensure safe ride on NEL", letter from Tammy Tan of [[SBS Transit]] to editor of [[The Straits Times]], [[24 December]] [[2005]]</ref> Safety campaign posters are highly visible in trains and stations, and the operators frequently broadcast [[Public service announcement|safety announcements]] to passengers and to commuters waiting for trains. [[Fire safety]] standards are consistent with the strict guidelines of the US [[National Fire Protection Association]]. [[Platform screen doors]] are installed at all underground stations. These doors prevent suicides, enable climate control in stations and prevent unauthorised access to restricted areas. Above-ground stations have open platforms, with a wide yellow line drawn along each platform edge for passengers to stand at a safe distance from arriving trains. [[Bylaws]] are implemented in the system to deter uncivil, disruptive and dangerous acts, such as smoking, the consumption of food and drinks, the frivolous use of safety features, and trespassing onto the railway tracks. Penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment are imposed for these offences.<ref>[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?actno=REVED-263A&doctitle=RAPID%20TRANSIT%20SYSTEMS%20ACT%0a&date=latest&method=part "Rapid Transit Systems Act (Chapter 263A, Section 42)"], [http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/ Singapore Statues Online], Retrieved [[7 December]] [[2005]]</ref>

Safety concerns were raised among the public after several accidents on the system during the 1980s and 1990s, but most problems have been rectified. On [[5 August]] [[1993]], two trains collided at [[Clementi MRT Station|Clementi station]] because of an [[oil spill]]age on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries.<ref>"''MRT Trains collide at Clementi : 132 hurt"'', Matthew/Branden Pereira et al, [[The Straits Times]], [[6 August]] [[1993]], pg 1 & 25.</ref> There were calls for platform screen doors to be installed at above-ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above-ground stations. However, the authorities rejected the proposal, because of doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs.<ref>[http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=1090 "Safety at MRT and LRT Stations - 'Respect The Yellow Line'"], [[Land Transport Authority]], Retrieved [[20 November]] [[2005]]</ref>

==Security on the MRT==
[[Image:mrtsecurity.jpg|right|thumb|275px|A [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit camera]] monitors activities at [[Toa Payoh MRT Station]].]]
{{main|Security on the Mass Rapid Transit}}

Security concerns related to crime and terrorism were not high on the agenda of the system's planners at its original inception.<ref>L<U+00F3>pez, M.J.J. (1996), Den Haag: RCM-advies, ''[http://www.rcm-advies.nl/Webpagina's/Transit%20Systems/Singapore%20-%20cp.htm "Crime Prevention Guidelines for the Construction & Management of Metro Systems"]'', pg. 35-39.</ref> However, in the wake of heightened security concerns after the [[Singapore embassies attack plot|foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station]]<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/arrests/release1_020124.htm "The Link of the Yishun Videotape"], [[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)]] Press Release, [[24 January]] [[2002]]</ref> and the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|Madrid train bombings in 2004]], the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and check the belongings of commuters.

Recorded announcements are frequently made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity and not to leave their belongings unattended. Digital [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit cameras]] (CCTVs) are being upgraded with recording-capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/99715/1/.html "CCTVs at 35 elevated MRT stations to have recording capability by Oct 2004"], Johnson Choo, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[7 August]] [[2004]]</ref><ref>''Buses, trains get security cameras'', Goh Chin Lian, [[The Straits Times]], [[6 June]] [[2006]]</ref>  Trash bins and mail boxes have been removed from station platforms and concourse levels to eliminate the risk that [[Improvised explosive device|bombs]] will be placed in them.

On [[14 April]] [[2005]], the [[Singapore Police Force]] announced plans to step up rail security by establishing a specialised [[Police MRT Unit]].<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/142602/1/.html "MRT stations to have armed police officers on patrol"], Dominique Loh, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[2 May]] [[2005]]</ref> These armed officers began overt patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on [[15 August]] [[2005]], conducting random patrols in pairs in and around rail stations and within trains. They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion, including deadly force if deemed necessary.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/163270/1/.html "Special armed police unit begins MRT patrols"], Johnson Choo, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[15 August]] [[2005]]</ref> On [[8 January]] [[2006]], a major civil exercise involving over 2,000 personnel from 22 government agencies, codenamed [[Exercise Northstar V]], simulating bombing and chemical attacks at Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay MRT stations was conducted. Thirteen stations were closed and about 3,400 commuters were affected during the three-hour duration of the exercise.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/187113/1/.html "Singapore holds largest-ever terror attack response drill"], [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[8 January]] [[2006]]</ref>

==Future expansion==
[[Image:Singapore_mrt_lrt_system_map_future.png|thumb|275px|right|An artist's representation of the possible MRT network after a series scheduled extensions, expected to occur by 2020, in addition to the current three lines. The routes and stations for the future lines are speculative and actual stations and routes are subjected to study by the [[National University of Singapore]].]]
[[Image:Construction_of_Bishan_MRT_Circle_Line_2005-03-29.JPG|right|275px|thumb|Construction is currently underway for the [[Bishan MRT Station]], to be linked to the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]].]]
The MRT system had relied on its two main lines, namely the North&ndash;South and East&ndash;West Lines, for more than a decade until the opening of the North East Line in 2003. While plans for these lines, as well as those currently under construction, were formulated long before, the [[Land Transport Authority]]'s (LTA) publication of a white paper entitled "''A World-Class Land Transport System''" in 1995 galvanised the government's intentions to greatly expand on the existing system.<ref>[http://www.lta.gov.sg/projects/index_proj_rail.htm "Other Rail Projects"], [[Land Transport Authority]], Retrieved [[7 December]] [[2005]]</ref> The plans allow for the long-term replacement of the bus network by rail-based transportation as the primary mode of public transportation. It called for the expansion of the existing 67 kilometres of track (in 1995) to over 160 in 10 to 15 years, and envisaged further expansion in the longer term. By 2030, the government envisages a rail network of 540 kilometres <U+2014> more extensive than London's 408-kilometre Tube system.<ref name="stnewlines">''"Groundwork begins for new MRT lines"'', Christoper Tan, [[The Straits Times]], [[13 March]] [[2006]]</ref>

===Circle Line===
{{main|Circle MRT Line}}
Currently under construction in five stages, the 33.3-kilometre [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]] will be the next major rail line to open after the North East Line began operating in June 2003. It was originally scheduled to be opened in stages from 2007 to 2010, but the completion of the first stage was postponed to about 2010<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/181044/1/.html "Four Circle Line stations won't be operational till 2010"] Yvonne Cheong, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[29 November]] [[2005]]</ref> when a section of tunnel near the [[Nicoll Highway MRT Station|Nicoll Highway station]] [[Nicoll Highway collapse|collapsed]] on [[20 April]] [[2004]] during its construction and caused the death of four workers.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/89371/1/.html "143 witnesses to give evidence at Nicoll Highway collapse inquiry: MOM"], S Ramesh, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[10 June]] [[2005]]</ref> The other four stages are expected to be opened progressively and on schedule from 2008 to 2010. When completed, the line will connect all the existing MRT lines, and will allow commuters to travel around the country without needing to go downtown to interchange with another line, reducing congestion especially at City Hall and Raffles Place stations.

It is also expected to have a Stage 6 which completes the circle from HarbourFront to Promenade stations.

===East West Line Boon Lay Extension===
The plan for Boon Lay MRT Extension (BLE) was announced by the Land Transport Authority on [[29 December]] [[2004]]. The 3.81-kilometre, two-station extension will extend from [[Boon Lay MRT Station]] on the western end of the East West MRT Line, with one station along Jurong West Street 63 (station name: [[Pioneer MRT Station|Pioneer]]), between Jurong West Street 61 and Pioneer Road North, and the second station at Joo Koon Circle (station name: [[Joo Koon MRT Station|Joo Koon]]), near the junction of Benoi Road and International Road.

The fully elevated extension will cost about S$436 million, which is expected to be completed by 2009. Construction works commenced on 11 March 2006.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/197268/1/.html "Boon Lay MRT extension to have two stations"], S Ramesh, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[11 March]] [[2006]]</ref> The alignment of the extension along Jurong West Street 63, Upper Jurong Road, and International Road has required the acquisition of 28,000 square metres of land.<ref>[http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=1138 "Expanding The Rail Network: LTA To Build Boon Lay MRT Extension"], [[Land Transport Authority]] Press Release, [[29 December]] [[2004]].</ref>

===Downtown Line Phase 1===
On [[14 June]] [[2005]], the Land Transport Authority announced that it would construct a Downtown Extension (DTE) to serve the Downtown at [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] (DTMB) area, where an [[integrated resort]] and Singapore's second botanical garden will be located. The 3.4-kilometre fully underground extension is estimated to cost S$1.4 billion. Construction of the extension is to start by 2007, with completion by 2012.

Three new stations will be constructed underground, linking the [[Promenade MRT Station|Promenade station]] on the Circle Line and the [[Chinatown MRT Station|Chinatown station]] on the North East Line. Two stations, tentatively named [[Bayfront MRT Station|Bayfront]] and [[Landmark MRT Station|Landmark]], will be built to serve the DTMB area. Another station, tentatively named [[Cross Street MRT Station|Cross Street]], will be built along Cross Street near the [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] area.<ref>[http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=1268 "Expanding The Rail Network With Downtown Extension"], [[Land Transport Authority]] Press Release, [[14 June]] [[2005]]</ref>

===Future lines===
The LTA is currently conducting feasibility studies for the 40 kilometre Downtown Line which will connect the northwestern and eastern regions of Singapore to the new downtown at [[Marina Bay, Singapore]] in the south. The Downtown Line will be a merger of the previously planned Bukit Timah Line, the Eastern Region Line and the confirmed Downtown Extension, now referred to as the Downtown Line Phase 1. .<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/239554/1/.html "MRT feasibility studies underway for Downtown Line"], Asha Popatlal, [[Channel NewsAsia]], [[5 November]] [[2006]]</ref>

Previously, the Bukit Timah Line was to be a 20-kilometre line that would connect the new downtown with the Bukit Panjang, Upper Bukit Timah and Bukit Timah corridor. It was to intersect the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]] and some other lines along the way. When constructed, it was expected to alleviate the heavy traffic along Bukit Timah, Dunearn Road and Upper Bukit Timah. Provisions have been made at [[Promenade MRT Station|Promenade]] Station which would have been the line's southern interchange with the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]]. Preliminary work has recently begun <U+2014> LTA was looking at possible station locations, soil profile and engineering challenges. If works had begun by 2010, when the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]] is completed, Bukit Timah Line would have been completed by 2016.<ref name="stnewlines" />

The Eastern Region Line was also to be a 40-kilometre rectangular loop that would complement the existing [[East West MRT Line|East-West Line]] and enhance inter- and intra-town travelling in the eastern region. It would have looped around the Jalan Besar and East Coast areas, intersecting the [[Circle MRT Line|Circle Line]] and other lines along the way, benefitting residents in Tampines, Bedok, Marine Parade, MacPherson and Kaki Bukit. Provisions have been made at [[Chinatown MRT Station|Chinatown]] Station, which would have been the line's western interchange with the [[North East MRT Line|North-East Line]] and the Downtown Line Phase 1. The northern segment of the loop was to be constructed first, passing through Jalan Besar area and eastwards to parts of Bedok and Tampines. Like the Bukit Timah Line, preliminary work had recently begun <U+2014> LTA was currently looking at possible station locations, soil profile and engineering challenges. If works had begun in 2016, the first segment of Eastern Region Line would have been ready by 2020.<ref name="stnewlines" />
