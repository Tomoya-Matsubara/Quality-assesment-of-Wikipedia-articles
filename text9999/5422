'''Mohammad Moin Khan''' ([[Urdu]]: '''<U+0645><U+062D><U+0645><U+062F> <U+0645><U+0639><U+06CC><U+0646> <U+062E><U+0627><U+0646>'''; born 23 September 1971), popularly known as '''Moin Khan''' ([[Urdu]]: '''<U+0645><U+0639><U+06CC><U+0646> <U+062E><U+0627><U+0646>'''), is a former [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistani]] [[cricket]]er, primarily a [[wicketkeeper]]-[[batsman]], who remained a member of the Pakistani national cricket team from 1990 to 2004. He has also captained the Pakistani side. He made his international debut against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] at [[Multan]]. He took over 100 catches in Test cricket. He has scored over 3,000 ODI runs and taken over 200 catches in ODI cricket. He is credited with coining the name of [[Saqlain Mushtaq]]'s mystery delivery that goes from leg to off, as the ''[[doosra]]''. It means the "other one" in Urdu. In July 2013, he replaced [[Iqbal Qasim]] as the chief selector of the [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan cricket team]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Moin Khan appointed as chief selector for Pakistan |url= http://www1.skysports.com/cricket/news/article/8825166/moin-handed-top-pakistan-role |publisher= Sky Sports |date= 15 July 2013 |accessdate= 15 July 2013}}</ref>

==Career==
Throughout his international career, Moin had to compete with another wicket-keeper, [[Rashid Latif]]. Moin kept wickets in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] which Pakistan won and the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]] where Pakistan finished runners up. Latif kept wickets in the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] and the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. Despite close rivalries, Moin is mostly remembered as the better player as their performance after the glove-work came onto how they batted. Despite having a significantly similar Test batting average, Moin had a higher ODI average than Latif and scored more runs than Latif in international cricket.

During the 1992 Cricket World Cup Semi-final against New Zealand, Pakistan needed 9 runs for 8 balls before Moin Khan hit a six to make it 3 runs off 7 balls. Then, Javed Miandad scored the winning boundary and Pakistan setup a clash in the world cup final with England. In the world cup final, Pakistan were 249 from 50 overs with Moin Khan not getting a chance to bat. However, he took three catches in the match including one of [[Ian Botham]] who went for a duck against an inswinger bowled by [[Wasim Akram]].<ref>http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65154.html</ref>

In 2005, Moin scored the first century in Pakistan domestic [[Twenty20 cricket]] when he smashed 112 off 59 balls for [[Karachi Dolphins]] against [[Lahore Lions]] in the [[Faysal Bank T20 Cup|ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup]]. At the end of the season, he retired from cricket finishing with 200 not out against Hyderabad, his highest first class score.

In 2007, Moin signed with the unofficial [[Indian Cricket League]] and coached the [[Hyderabad Heroes]]. In the 2008 edition of the competition, he coached the expansion team, the [[Lahore Badshahs]].
