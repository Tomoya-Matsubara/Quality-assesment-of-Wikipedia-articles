Born in Lincoln, the son of a lawyer, Race learned the piano from the age of five.<ref name="Leigh">Spencer Leigh [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/steve-race-musician-and-broadcaster-best-known-for-his-association-with-the-programme-my-music-1715941.html "Steve Race: Musician and broadcaster best known for his association with the programme 'My Music'",] ''The Independent'', 24 June 2009</ref> He was educated (1932<U+2013>37) at [[Lincoln Christ's Hospital School|Lincoln School]], where he formed his first jazz band, which included a young [[Neville Marriner]], later a major figure in the world of classical music. At sixteen, he attended the [[Royal Academy of Music]], studying composition under [[Harry Farjeon]] and [[William Alwyn]].

== Early career ==
He joined the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1941, and formed a jazz/dance band [[quintet]].  After [[World War II]] he began a long and productive career with the [[BBC]], where his ready wit, musicianship and broad musical knowledge made him much sought after as a musical accompanist for panel games and magazine shows, such as ''Whirligig'' and ''[[Many a Slip]]''. In 1949 his jazz group recorded the first British [[bebop]] records.

== Presenter ==
From the 1950s to the 1980s he presented countless music programmes on [[radio]] and [[television]]. Additionally, in 1955, he was appointed the first Light Music Advisor to the early [[ITV|independent television company]] [[Associated-Rediffusion]]. He is probably best known as the chairman of the long-running light-hearted radio and TV [[panel game]] ''[[My Music]]'' from 1967 to 1994.  He presented and wrote most of the questions for all 520 episodes broadcast. Away from music, for two years from 1970 Race co-presented (with [[William Hardcastle (broadcaster)|William Hardcastle]]) the [[BBC Radio 4]] "drive-time" news magazine ''[[PM (Radio 4)|PM]]''.

== Composer ==
As a composer, he produced a number of pieces in the [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]] and popular idioms. One of his better-known compositions is the short melodic piano instrumental "Nicola" (named after his daughter). His catchy "Pied Piper" (The Beeje) was also popular and reached number 29 in the charts in March 1963, but his best-known and, according to his autobiography, his most lucrative composition is his music for the [[Birds Eye]] frozen peas [[jingle]], "Sweet as the moment when the pod went pop". 

His autobiography, ''Musician at Large'', was published in 1979, and in 1988 Souvenir Press Ltd published Race's book about his Grandfather's short but interesting life, from lead miner to missionary, entitled "The Two Worlds of Joseph Race"

Race was survived by his second wife and daughter from his first marriage.
