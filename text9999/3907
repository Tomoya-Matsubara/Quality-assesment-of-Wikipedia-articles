The '''''Hennepin''''' is a [[shipwreck]] off the east coast of [[Lake Michigan]], west of [[South Haven, Michigan]]. The ship was originally built in October 1888 and sank on August 18, 1927. [[Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates]] found the ship in 2006 and conducted several dives to assess the condition of the wreck.<ref name="msra">{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganshipwrecks.org/hennepin.htm|title=MSRA - The wreck of the Hennepin|publisher=[[Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates]]|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> The wreck was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on February 1, 2008.<ref name="nris"/> It is significant as the first self-unloading [[bulk carrier]].<ref name="dvd">{{cite video

==Career==
The ship was originally built as the ''George H. Dyer'' by the firm of Wolf and Davidson in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. It was equipped with a steam engine at the time. The ship changed owners a few times, and in 1898,{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}} it was later the ''Hennepin'', after [[Louis Hennepin]], an explorer of the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name="dvd"/>

On June 27, 1901, the ship caught fire in [[Buffalo, New York]]. The fire damaged most of the upper deck and most of the machinery. The ship was sold to the Lake Shore Stone Company, who fitted it with a conveyor belt and made it a self-unloading ship. This was the world's first self-unloading ship, and it provided the paradigm for the many self-unloading vessels in use today. The ship had a 1600 ton capacity. It was put to work loading stone from a [[quarry]] in [[Stone Haven, Wisconsin]].<ref name="msra"/><ref name="dvd"/>

Later, in 1923, it was purchased by Construction Materials Corporation and put to use hauling [[construction aggregate]] from a quarry on the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] to [[Chicago]]. The hull was wearing out and becoming unstable, so the ship was converted to a barge by removing its engine. It was hauled by the [[tugboat]]s ''Ufasco'' in 1926 and ''Lotus'' in 1927.<ref name="msra"/><ref name="dvd"/>

==Wreck event==
On August 18, 1927, around 10:30 AM, the ''Hennepin'' ran into a [[squall]] in the middle of Lake Michigan. The vessel had sprung a leak, and although the crew worked to save the ship, the pumps could not keep up with the volume of water coming in. The crew worked until 2:30 PM that afternoon, but they were unsuccessful, and the crew abandoned ship for the safety of the tugboat ''Lotus''. The ''Hennepin'' finally sank around 6:00 PM. Upon the return to port, Captain Ole Hansen said, "She died a hard death."<ref name="msra"/>

==Discovery==
Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates members were searching for the wreck of [[Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501]] in 2006. In the process of mapping out sections of the lake, they discovered debris on the bottom that appeared to be a wreck. At first, they identified a small structure that they nicknamed a "rib cage", but more searching revealed a ship. They sent a team of [[technical diving|technical divers]] to explore the wreck, which was in about {{convert|200|ft|m}} of water. The team examined a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]] and discovered the name "G.H. Dyer" stamped onto the cover, which confirmed it as the ''Hennepin''. The pilothouse had been blown off when it sank, but the wheel was still in place and intact. The ship had hit [[stern]]-first as identified by the wreckage. The conveyor belts and the A-frame crane structure were still in place and further identified the ship as the ''Hennepin''.<ref name="dvd"/>
