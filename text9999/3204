'''Our Lady of Ambronay''' (fr:Notre-Dame d'Ambronay) is an old [[Benedictine]] abbey found in the centre of the French village of [[Ambronay]] in the [[Ain]] department. 

A church was founded by hermits in the seventh century, but this was destroyed by [[Saracens]].  A church and monastery was rebuilt around 803 by the then abbot Saint [[Bernard of Vienne]] and the facade of one of the naves dates from the ninth century. The church was expanded around the middle of the thirteenth century.  

The abbey was destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] in 1793.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Our Lady of Ambronay}}</ref> The church was saved from destruction despite having been converted into stables, and is once again a place of worship. 

The church is regarded as a sanctuary of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and the 1913 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] described it as "one of the two candles of devotion to Our Lady in the [[Diocese of Belley]]".<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Our Lady of Ambronay}}</ref>

Its excellent acoustics have led to its hosting the [[Ambronay Festival]], an international [[baroque music]] festival.<ref>[http://www.ambronay.org/ Festival d'Ambronay]</ref>
