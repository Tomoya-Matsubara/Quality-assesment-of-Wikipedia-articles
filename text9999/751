'''Wotho Atoll''' is one of the [[Marshall Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is part of the western [[Ralik]] group of [[atoll]]s.  Wotho has a population of 160.

The Atoll consists of 18 [[islet]]s and has a total land area of 4.33<U+00A0>km<U+00B2>. (1.67 square miles) and a lagoon of 94.92<U+00A0>km<U+00B2>. (36.65 square miles).

The atoll was also known as '''Schantz Islands''' after [[Johan Eberhard von Schantz]], who discovered the islands on his circumnavigation of the globe on the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] ship ''America''.<ref>[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kenraalit/?gid=352 von Schantz, Johan Eberhard] {{fi icon}}</ref>
