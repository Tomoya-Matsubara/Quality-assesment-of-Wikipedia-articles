Jonas Bretk<U+016B>nas, Johann(es) Bretke was born in [[Ducal Prussia]] in [[1536]]. His father was German (according to Gerullis) or Germanized Prussian <ref name=XXI> [http://www.xxiamzius.lt/archyvas/xxiamzius/20021127/zvil_01.html Bretk<U+016B>nas ir jo svarbiausias rankra<U+0161>tis] </ref> , and his mother from a native Prussian family. The language spoken in the area was primarily German, while Jonas Bretk<U+016B>nas native languages were [[Old Prussian]] and Lithuanian.<ref name=XXI/> Lithuanian language was also used and in state chancellery as well.<ref name=XXI/>  Different people, who had come to Protestant Prussia did at the time, because the Evangelical faith had promised to preach in languages people understood rather than Latin. The Duke of Prussia therefore arranged for the education and studies of languages for pastors. In [[1544]], Duke [[Albert I, Duke of Prussia|Albrecht]], had founded the [[Albertina University]] in K<U+00F6>nigsberg and the area became one of the centers of learning for the neighboring peoples of [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Poland]], none of them had bibles in their language up to that time. As the Duke of the first Evangelical State, Albrecht supported the translations of the Bible into these languages.

In [[1555]], when Bretk<U+016B>nas was nineteen years of age, he began studying [[theology]] at the University of [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]]. In [[1556]], he transferred to [[Wittenberg]] University. During his studies, in [[1562]], he was appointed a [[Lutheran]] pastor at [[Labiau]] (now Polessk) by Duke Albert. He was the first pastor at Labiau who could give sermons in Prussian  and the Lithuanian language. Before that pastors often employed ''Tolken'', who translated the sermons directly to the congregation. In [[1563]], Bretke married Frl. von Werthern. It was a rural, poor parish and pastors were expected to make their own living by receiving some farm land. Bretk<U+016B>nas was not at all inclined to farming and wanted to spend all his time on language studies and translations.  In [[1579]], he started translating the handwritten Bible from German using [[Martin Luther]]'s analog, and the translation took more than ten years to complete, with tens of thousands of correction notes. Between 1578<U+2013>1579, he wrote the Chronicles of Prussian Lands (''Chronicon des Landes Preussen'') in German. 

After living twenty-five meager years in Labiau, Bretke (Jonas Bretk<U+016B>nas) applied for a position as pastor at another Prussian town, but was in [[1587]] transferred to a Lithuanian language  parish in K<U+00F6>nigsberg as pastor. <ref name=MII>[http://postilla.mch.mii.lt/Istorija/biblija.htm#Bretk%FBnas Jonas Bretk<U+016B>nas]</ref> He continued with his translation of the Bible and other scholarly works. In 1589, he  published several new works, in particular ''"Giesmes duchaunos"'' (Spiritual Hymns), based on [[Martynas Ma<U+017E>vydas]]' works, as well as a small collection of hymns called ''"Kancionalas netukriu giesmiu"'', and a prayer book translation from German into Lithuanian ''"Kollectas"'', all printed by Georg Osterberg of K<U+00F6>nigsberg. 

On [[November 29]], [[1590]], Bretke-Bretk<U+016B>nas finally completed his translation of the Bible (Old and New Testaments). It is the first surviving translation of the Bible into the Lithuanian language. <ref> [http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13571&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO. Jonas Bretkunas]</ref> The matter of publishing this Bible was discussed by the Lutheran college, but he failed to receive permission to publish it. Later the manuscripts of the Bretk<U+016B>nas Bible were purchased by [[George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|Duke Georg Friedrich]]. In [[1591]], he finished the Postilla ([[Postil<U+0117>]]), one of his best known works, consisting of two parts. In his final years Bretk<U+016B>nas continued to unsuccessfully lobby for publishing his Bible, but in [[1602]] he died.
