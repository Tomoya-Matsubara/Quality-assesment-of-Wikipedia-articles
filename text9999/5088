'''Philippe Poisson''' (born 1984), better known as '''Phil Fish''', is a [[French Canadian]] former [[indie games|indie]] [[video game designer]], best known for his work on the 2012 [[platform game]] ''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]'' published by his company, Polytron Corporation. He was born and raised in Quebec, where his experiences with [[Nintendo]] games in his youth would later influence his game design. He studied game design at the Montreal National Animation and Design Centre, and worked at [[Ubisoft]] and [[Artificial Mind and Movement]] before starting Polytron in 2008.

Fish was a founding member of [[Kokoromi]], a collective that explores experimental gameplay ideas, and organized Montreal's annual GAMMA games events. While ''Fez'' was in development, Fish worked on other unreleased games at Polytron, including ''Super Hypercube'' and ''Power Pill''.

''Fez'' was released in April 2012 to widespread acclaim after a protracted five-year development cycle. Its final phases of development were shown in the 2012 documentary ''[[Indie Game: The Movie]]'', which brought Fish celebrity unusual for game developers. Following an online argument in July 2013, Fish publicly announced his exit from game development citing long-term mistreatment by the industry.

== Early life and career ==

Phil Fish was born Philippe Poisson<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/> in Montreal in 1984.<ref name="Space Time Play"/> He was raised in Quebec. His parents shared their interest in art and gaming with him. When Fish was young, his father translated ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' into French to share the game with his son. Fish credits these memories as formative, and later cited their influence on ''Fez''.<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/> He graduated from the 2004 Design and Digital Art for Video Games program at the Montreal NAD (National Animation and Design Centre).<ref name="NAD grad"/>

Fish began his career at the video game publisher [[Ubisoft]],<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/> where he worked on ''[[Open Season (video game)|Open Season]]'' as a level designer.<ref name="GamesRadar: first game"/> He was initially excited for the job but grew disenchanted with their large development teams and working conditions, later describing it as "the worst experience of [his] life". He was later fired from the company.<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/>

On May 24, 2006, Fish won the [[Artificial Mind and Movement]] Award for Best Cut-Scene at the annual NAD Center Awards of Excellence Gala.<ref name="NAD award"/><ref name="DI IT in brief"/> Later that year, Fish began work as a level designer at Artificial Mind and Movement,<ref name="NAD news 2007 March"/> where he worked on [[video game tie-in|film tie-in games]]<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/> including ''[[The Golden Compass (video game)|The Golden Compass]]''.<ref name="Golden Compass"/>

Fish is a founding member of [[Kokoromi]], a group that designs<ref name="Space Time Play"/> and promotes experimental video games.<ref name="This 2007"/> He led a November 2006 event called GAMMA 01 :: Audio Feed at the Arcadia Festival that featured games based around live sound.<ref name="NAD news 2007 March"/> He planned a similar event, GAMMA 256,<ref name="NAD news 2007 March"/> for 2007. The third in the series, GAMMA 3D, took place in Montreal in November 2008.<ref name="IndieGames.com: interview 2008"/> Fish was invited to present a lecture on GAMMA 01 at the 2007 [[Game Developers Conference]].<ref name="NAD news 2007 March"/> He wrote a review of the 1999 ''[[Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver]]'' in the 2007 ''Space Time Play: Synergies Between Computer Games, Architecture and Urbanism: the Next Level''.<ref name="Space Time Play"/> Fish has been characterized by Sean Hollister of ''[[The Verge]]'' as "notorious for voicing angry, controversial opinions about the state of video games".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/27/4563738/fez-ii-abruptly-canceled-after-developer-phil-fish-explodes-in-rage | title='Fez II' abruptly cancelled after developer Phil Fish explodes in rage on Twitter | work=[[The Verge]]|date=July 27, 2013|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Shawn McGrath, camping, 2011 (5949213353).jpg|thumb|Shawn McGrath, 2011]] Fish began to work with Toronto-based indie developer [[Dyad (video game)|Shawn McGrath]] on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game that showed 2D views of a 3D space. Fish provided the project's art<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/> until the partnership crumbled due to creative differences: Fish wanted their product to be more of a [[platform game]].<ref name="GamesTM: trials 1"/> Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time,<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/> and incorporated the idea of [[voxel]]s (3D pixels), where a 2D pixel could be seen from four sides. The game would become ''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]'' and the game's design, lore, and art derived from this [[game mechanic]]. Fish searched for a programmer on [[DeviantArt]] and Renaud B<U+00E9>dard, the first person to apply, became the game's programmer.<ref name="GamesTM: trials 1"/> ''Fez'' was first announced in July 2007<ref name="Download.com lands on Windows"/> and was nominated for two awards at the 2008 [[Game Developers Conference]] [[Independent Games Festival]].<ref name="IndieGames.com: IGF 2008"/> Fish's employer, Artificial Mind and Movement, would not let him take leave from work to attend, so Fish quit. He marked this January 2008 moment as "when I became indie". The game received widespread attention upon its showing at the festival, leading Fish to open Polytron Corporation as a [[startup company]] with a government loan.<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/>

Polytron later ran out of money,<ref name="GamesTM: trials 2"/> and Fish was considering ending the project until Polytron's Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois neighbor, developer-producer [[Trapdoor (company)|Trapdoor]], offered to help Polytron without transferring its intellectual property rights. According to Fish, the partnership saved ''Fez''.<ref name="Gamasutra: Breaking"/> The game was delayed several times over the next few years<ref name="Kotaku: delayed"/> for which it received some notoriety.<ref name="Polygon: review"/>

[[File:Renaud B<U+00E9>dard, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|''Fez'' programmer Renaud B<U+00E9>dard, 2013]] In late 2009, Polytron presented an [[iPhone]] game called ''Power Pill'' at Pecha Kucha Montreal. The game features a panacean pill that travels through human bodies as its [[player character|playable]] protagonist, and it uses the iPhone's [[multi-touch]] screen. ''[[GameSetWatch]]''{{'s}} Eric Caoili compared it to ''[[Soul Bubbles]]'' and ''[[Irritating Stick]]''. The game was developed with [[Alec Holowka]] of Infinite Ammo, and a [[level editor]] was expected to be included.<ref name="GameSetWatch: Power Pill"/>

While working on ''Fez'', Fish revived a game project called ''Super Hypercube'', which was based on [[Wiimote]] [[motion capture]] input and [[stereoscopic]] navigation. Fish felt the game would work better with the new [[Kinect]] motion tracking. The adapted game was a finalist at [[Indiecade]] 2011.<ref name="Gamasutra: Breaking"/>

Fish and ''Fez'' were featured prominently in the 2012 documentary ''[[Indie Game: The Movie]]'', through which Fish received celebrity unusual for game developers.<ref name=NBC/> The chronicles the stories of several indie developers at various stages of their games' development cycles, and Fish is shown preparing for ''Fez''{{'s}} booth at [[PAX East]] in March 2011. The film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes the game's release.<ref name="Eurogamer: IGTM review"/> The partner, believed to be Jason DeGroot, is portrayed negatively and does not participate onscreen.<ref name="Polygon: IGTM resolve"/> The film also tracks Fish's personal and emotional investment in the game. ''[[Eurogamer]]'' wrote that the part where Fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is "the film's most startling moment".<ref name="Eurogamer: IGTM review"/> ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' wrote that Fish is portrayed as melodramatic, theatrical, and neurotic, and that the film will exacerbate his outspoken public perception.<ref name="RPS: IGTM review"/> ''[[Game Informer]]'' called Fish the film's "most memorable developer".<ref name="GI: IGTM Where Now"/> The film's end credits were later corrected to reflect that Fish's business partner was not asked for input.<ref name="Polygon: IGTM resolve"/>

Near the end of development, Fish felt "burnt out" and that his personal health had suffered.<ref name="Gamasutra: Breaking"/> ''Fez'' was released on April 13, 2012 and sold 200,000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform.<ref name="GameZone: PC preorders"/> The video game review aggregator [[Metacritic]] described reviews for the 2012 Xbox 360 ''Fez'' as "generally favorable"<ref name="Metacritic: X360"/> and those for the 2013 PC version as "universal acclaim".<ref name="Metacritic: PC"/> While in development, ''Fez'' had won the 2012 GDC Independent Games Festival's Seamus McNally Grand Prize,<ref name="Polygon: sequel announced"/> the 2011 Indiecade Best in Show and Best Story/World Design,<ref name="Shacknews: IndieCade 2011"/> and the 2008 GDC Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Visual Art.<ref name="Kotaku: moment of clarity"/> ''Eurogamer'' awarded ''Fez'' a perfect score<ref name="Eurogamer: review"/> and named the "perfect, wordless [[sci-fi]] [[parable]]" their 2012 [[Game of the Year]].<ref name="Eurogamer: GOTY"/> Fish announced eventual ports for {{"'}}pretty much' every platform" but the [[Nintendo 3DS]].<ref name="VG247: pretty much"/> It sold one million copies by the end of 2013.<ref name="bit-tech: million"/> ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'s}} Chris Suellentrop called Fish "a [[Quentin Tarantino]] of [[8-bit era|8-bit gaming]]".<ref name="NYT: delights"/>

A ''Fez'' sequel was announced as "[[one more thing]]" at end of the Horizon indie game press conference during the June 2013 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].<ref name="Polygon: one more thing"/> A Twitter argument between Fish and ''[[GameTrailers]]'' journalist Marcus Beer a month later culminated in the project's cancellation and Fish's exit from the industry. In an episode of his show ''[[Invisible Walls]]'', Beer had criticized Fish's recent response to questions about Microsoft's [[Xbox One]] self-publishing policy change. On Twitter, Fish condemned the industry for its negativity before his final tweet announced the cancellation and his leave.<ref name="Polygon: sequel canceled"/> The news came as a surprise to the rest of Polytron,<ref name="Polygon: sequel surprise"/> which has not commented on upcoming projects other than ports since the sequel's cancellation.<ref name="Shacknews: PS4"/> ''Polygon'' listed Fish in their top 50 newsmakers of 2013 for the social power of his "caustic use of Twitter".<ref name="Polygon: 50"/>
