The '''Paulins Kill''' (also known as '''Paulinskill''' or '''Paulinskill River''') is a 28.6&nbsp;mile (46&nbsp;km) long tributary of the [[Delaware River]] in northwestern [[New Jersey]] in the [[United States]].  It is New Jersey's third largest contributor (behind the [[Musconetcong River]] and [[Maurice River]]) to the Delaware River in terms of long-term median flow&mdash;flowing at a rate of 76&nbsp;cubic feet of water per second (2.15&nbsp;m<U+00B3>/s).<ref>[http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nj/nwis/current/?type=flow USGS National Water Information System: Web Interface - Real-Time Data for New Jersey: Streamflow] no further authorship information given, accessed [[30 October]] [[2006]].</ref>  The Paulins Kill drains an area of 176.85&nbsp;square miles (458&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) across portions of two counties ([[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex]] and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]]) consisting of eleven municipalities.  The Paulins Kill, which flows southwest from its source near [[Newton, New Jersey]], is located at the border of the [[Appalachians]] and [[New York-New Jersey Highlands]] physiographic provinces.

The Paulins Kill was a conduit for the [[emigration]] of [[Rheinland-Palatinate|Palatine]] [[Germans]] who settled in northwestern New Jersey and northeastern [[Pennsylvania]] during the [[Colonial America|colonial period]] and the [[American Revolution]].  Remnants of their settlement are still found in local [[architecture]] and [[Cemetery|cemeteries]].  The results of these settlements were chiefly [[agriculture|agricultural]], as evinced by surviving [[farm]]s and [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s, and the area remains largely [[rural]] to this day.

Flowing through rural sections of [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex]] and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren]] counties, the Paulins Kill and its surrounding valley are regarded as an excellent venue for [[fly fishing]], [[hiking]], other forms of [[recreation]] and observation of a multitude of species of [[birdwatching|birds]] and other [[wildlife]]. 

==Geography and geology==
===Course===
[[Image:Paulins_Kill.png|thumb|right|The 28.6&nbsp;mile (46.03&nbsp;km) long Paulins Kill drains an area of 177 square miles (458 square kilometers) in northwestern New Jersey and is part of the Delaware River watershed.]]
The Paulins Kill, itself a tributary of the [[Delaware River]], is fed by several mountain streams&mdash;many of which are unnamed. However, several larger named streams contribute their waters to the Paulinskill at various points along its 28.6-mile (46&nbsp;km) length. The river emanates from two branches that merge near the hamlet of [[Augusta, New Jersey|Augusta]], in [[Frankford Township, New Jersey]]. 

The main, or eastern, branch of the Paulins Kill begins immediately north and west of [[Newton, New Jersey]] in the marshes that straddle both Newton and the northern reaches of [[Fredon Township, New Jersey|Fredon Township]].<ref>{{Gnis|879174}}, no further authorship information given, accessed [[16 December]] [[2006]].</ref> ''Moore's Brook'' is one of several small mountain streams, some beginning at small ponds, that enter the Paulins Kill near its source.  The river flows northward into [[Lafayette Township, New Jersey|Lafayette Township]] before curving west where it meets with the combined waters of the ''Culver Brook'' (also known as the Western branch of the Paulins Kill) and the ''Dry Brook'' near the hamlet of [[Augusta, New Jersey|Augusta]] in [[Frankford Township, New Jersey|Frankford Township]].  The Culver Brook begins at [[Culver's Lake, New Jersey|Culver's Lake]], in the western portion of Frankford Township and flows east through [[Branchville, New Jersey|Branchville]] before the two branches merge.  

The Paulins Kill then flows southwest for the rest of its journey, through [[Hampton Township, New Jersey|Hampton]] and [[Stillwater Township, New Jersey|Stillwater Township]]s in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]].  The ''Trout Brook'', which rises on Kittatinny Mountain, flows into the Paulins Kill near Middleville in Stillwater Township.  [[Swartswood State Park|Swartswood Lake]] feeds the Trout Brook through ''Keen's Mill Brook''.  The Paulins Kill continues its course southwest, entering [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], where it initially forms the border between [[Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey|Frelinghuysen]] and [[Hardwick Township, New Jersey|Hardwick Township]]s. It enters [[Blairstown, New Jersey|Blairstown]] immediately after, where it is joined by ''Blair Creek'' named (as is the town) for [[John Insley Blair]] (1802<U+2013>1899), as well as ''Jacksonburg Creek'', ''Dilts Creek'' and ''Walnut Creek''.  ''Yard's Creek'', which rises at the Yard's Creek reservoir in Blairstown, enters the Paulins Kill near the hamlet of Hainesburg in [[Knowlton Township, New Jersey|Knowlton Township]]. Finally, in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] its waters enter the [[Delaware River]] just south of the [[Delaware Water Gap]] at the hamlet of Columbia in Knowlton Township.<ref>{{Gnis|879174|USGS Geographic Names Information System Feature Detail Report}}, no further authorship information given, accessed [[16 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

A dam was built in the 1920s across the Paulins Kill in Stillwater Township, to create Paulinskill Lake, a narrow, 3-mile (4.8&nbsp;km) long body of water that stretches back into Hampton Township to the north. It was constructed in response to the 1914 establishment of [[Swartswood State Park]], to provide seasonal (summer) housing and recreation for vacationers from the New York metropolitan area. At present, it is a year-round residential community managed by a homeowners association.<ref>[http://www.njskylands.com/tnstlwtr.htm "Stillwater"] by Jane Dobosh at ''Skylands Magazine'' website, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref>

Today, several dams and [[mill race]]s remain from the [[Gristmill|grist]], [[Sawmill|saw]], [[Expeller|oil]] and [[fulling mill]]s built along the river's banks during the 18th and 19th century, and continue to alter the course and flow of the river.

===Valley and watershed===
The valley and [[Drainage basin|watershed]] of the Paulins Kill is bordered on the west by the [[Kittatinny Mountains|Kittatinny Ridge]] of the [[Appalachians]].<ref>United States Geological Survey topographical map, "Newton East" and "Newton West"</ref> Kittatinny Mountain, which is a segment of the Blue Ridge chain of the Appalachians, has been known historically as ''Schawangunk Mountain'' (as it is known north of the [[New York]]-[[New Jersey]] border), or ''Pahaqualong Mountain''. Beginning at the western boundary of the Paulins Kill valley and extending westward to the [[Delaware River]] (and beyond that to the Allegheny Mountains), is the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Ridge and Valley physiographic province]], one of four physiographic provinces of New Jersey.  This area was largely formed through the fold-and-thrust action 300 million years ago during the [[Alleghenian orogeny]].<ref>

Aber, accessed [[16 September]] [[2006]].</ref> The valley floor and its eastern boundary largely constitute the northwesternmost reaches of the [[New York-New Jersey Highlands]] region&mdash;a geological formation composed primarily of pre-[[Cambrian]] igneous and metamorphic rock&mdash;within New Jersey.<ref>[http://training.fws.gov/library/pubs5/web_link/text/ny_njh.htm Significant Habitats and Habitat Complexes of the New York Bight Watershed: New York-New Jersey Highlands, Complex #25] from U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, no further authorship information given, accessed [[16 December]] [[2006]].</ref>  Elevations within the Highlands region separate the  Paulins Kill watershed from the watersheds of the [[Pequest River]] and [[Musconetcong River]] located a few miles to the east.<ref>''Hagstrom Morris/Sussex/Warren counties atlas'' (Maspeth, New York: Hagstrom Map Company, Inc. 2004); United States Geological Survey topographical map, "Newton East" and "Newton West"</ref>

The Paulins Kill and its watershed share the Mamakating valley with [[Papakating Creek]], which flows northward to the [[Wallkill River]] and is a part of the [[Hudson River]] watershed. Historically, this valley was often called "Mamakating", from the [[Lenape language|Lenape]] for "valley of the divided waters"&mdash;however, this name has fallen into disuse in the latter half of the 20th century.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  At their closest, the Papakating Creek and Paulins Kill flow within one mile of each other, in [[Frankford Township, New Jersey|Frankford Township]] in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]].<ref>''Hagstrom Morris/Sussex/Warren counties atlas'' (Maspeth, New York: Hagstrom Map Company, Inc. 2004).</ref>

==History==
===Origins of the name===
[[Image:Paulinskill 1905 Baleville.jpg|thumb|A vintage postcard view of the Paulins Kill at Baleville, in [[Hampton Township, New Jersey]], circa 1905.  The Paulins Kill is a calm, slow-flowing river, without significant disturbance or rapids, and looks much like this view for all of its length.]]
The [[United States Geological Survey]] [[United States Board on Geographic Names|Board of Geographic Names]] decided that the official spelling of the name would be ''Paulins Kill'' in 1898.<ref> {{Gnis|879174|USGS Geographic Names Information System Feature Detail Report}}, no further authorship information given, accessed [[24 August]] [[2006]].</ref> Other spellings (''Pawlins Kill'' or ''Paulinskill'') have remained in common use. The use of ''Paulinskill River'', however&mdash;while often used&mdash;is redundant as ''[[Kill (body of water)|Kill]]'' is a geographic designation for a small stream or creek, derived from [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

Local tradition says that the Paulins Kill was named for a girl named Pauline, the daughter of a [[Hessian]] soldier. During the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], Hessian soldiers captured at the [[Battle of Trenton]] and other skirmishes within New Jersey were held as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in the [[Stillwater, New Jersey]] area. Several of these Hessians are alleged to have deserted the British and taken up residence in Stillwater because of the village's predominantly German emigrant population. The assumption is that the name Paulins Kill was derived from "Pauline's Kill."<ref>''Northwestern New Jersey<U+2014>A History of Somerset, Morris, Hunterdon, Warren, and Sussex Counties'', Vol. 1. (A. Van Doren Honeyman, ed. in chief, Lewis Historical Publishing Co., New York, 1927), 499; Snell, James P. (1881) ''History of Sussex and Warren Counties, New Jersey, With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers''. (Philadelphia: Everts & Peck, 1881), 379.</ref> However, the fact that the name Paulins Kill is present on maps and surveys dating from the 1740s and 1750s&mdash;two and three decades before the Revolution&mdash;negates the veracity of this tradition.<ref>Labelled "Tockhockonetkunk or Pawlings Kill" on an untitled map of Jonathan Hampton (1758) in the collection of the New Jersey Historical Society, Newark, New Jersey; also ''Documents Relating to the Colonial, Revolutionary and Post-Revolutionary History of the State of New Jersey''. [Title Varies]. Archives of the State of New Jersey, 1st<U+2013>2nd series. 47 volumes. (Newark, New Jersey, 1880<U+2013>1949, passim.</ref> Further, some local traditions state that the girl's name was Pauline Snover, however extant genealogical records do not indicate that any person existed by that name at that time.

Two other possibilities for the naming of the Paulins Kill are more likely. First, that the wife of one of the area's first [[settler]]s, Johan Peter Bernhardt (died 1748), was named Maria Paulina and that she had died prior to the first settlement at Stillwater in 1742. However, very few records are extant detailing Bernhardt's family. The second and most likely etymological origin is that the Native American name given to the mountain on the valley's western flank, ''Pahaqualong'' (also spelled ''Pahaqualin'', ''Pohoqualin'' and ''Pahaquarra'') may have been corrupted and anglicized to a spelling such as "Paulins" by early white settlers or surveyors. Pahaqualong is roughly translated as <U+201C>end of two mountains with stream between<U+201D>, from a combination of the words ''pe<U+2019>uck'' meaning <U+201C>water hole,<U+201D> ''qua'' meaning <U+201C>boundary,<U+201D> and the suffix ''-onk'' meaning <U+201C>place.<U+201D><ref>Decker, Amelia Stickney, ''That Ancient Trail'' (Trenton, New Jersey: Privately printed, 1942), 151; Anthony and Brinton, op. cit.</ref>  This translation is thought to refer either to the valley of the Paulins Kill itself, or to the [[Delaware Water Gap]].  Local tradition does place an Indian village named ''Pahaquarra'' near the mouth of the Paulinskill which is immediately south of the Delaware Water Gap. Likewise, [[Pahaquarry Township, New Jersey|Pahaquarry Township]] in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] derives its name from this origin.<ref>Snell, op cit., 23</ref>

A village named ''Paulina'' located a short distance east of [[Blairstown, New Jersey]] on [[Route 94 (New Jersey)|Route 94]], is said to have been named "from the stream upon which it is located." William Armstrong, a local settler, built the first grist mill there along the river in 1768, and the village took root.<ref>Snell, op. cit., 688.</ref>

The Paulins Kill was originally known as the ''Tockhockonetcong'' by the local Native Americans who were likely [[Munsee]], a [[tribe]] or [[phratry]] of the [[Lenni Lenape]]. The name ''Tockhockonetcong'' (or ''Tockhockonetcunk'') roughly translates to "stream that comes from Tok-Hok-Nok"&mdash;''Tok-hok-nok'' being an Indian village believed to been within the boundaries of present-day [[Newton, New Jersey]],<ref>Snell, op. cit., 23.</ref> near which the eastern (main) branch of the Paulins Kill begins, and the [[Lenape language|Lenape]] roots ''hannek'' meaning "stream" and the suffix ''-ong'' denoting "place."<ref>Anthony, A. S., Rev. and Brinton, Daniel G. ''Lenape-English Dictionary''. (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: The Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1883).</ref>

===Early settlement===
[[Image:Caspershaferhouse1741.jpg|thumb|right|Home built by Casper Shafer in Stillwater, New Jersey.  The architecture is typical of colonial-era and early America houses built by the German emigrants who settled in the Paulins Kill valley. The log cabin portion of the structure (left) dates from ''circa'' 1742, and the stone portion (right) from ''circa'' 1750.]]
The first human settlement along the Paulins Kill was by early Native Americans circa 8,000<U+2013>10,000 BC at the close of the last [[ice age]] (known as the [[Wisconsin glaciation]]). At the time of the first settlement by emigrating Europeans in this region, it was populated by the [[Munsee]] tribe of the [[Lenni Lenape]] (or Delaware) Indians.  Artifacts (often of stone, clay or bone) of the Native American culture are often found in nearby farm fields and at the site of their ancient villages.<ref>Schrabisch, Max. ''Indian habitations in Sussex County, New Jersey'' Geological Survey of New Jersey, Bulletin No. 13. (Union Hill, New Jersey: Dispatch Printing Company, 1915); and ''Archaeology of Warren and Hunterdon counties'' Geological Survey of New Jersey, Bulletin No. 18. (Trenton, N.J., MacCrellish and Quigley co., state printers, 1917).</ref>

Typically, early European settlement along the Paulins Kill was by [[Rhineland-Palatinate|Palatine]] [[Germans]] who had emigrated to the New World via the port of [[Philadelphia]] from 1720 to 1800. Many had treked north through the valley of the Delaware and settled along the [[Musconetcong River|Musconetcong]], [[Pequest River|Pequest]] and Paulins Kill valleys in [[New Jersey]] and along the [[Lehigh River]] valley in [[Pennsylvania]].  Areas along the Paulins Kill generally were not settled until the 1740s and 1750s.<ref>Chambers, Theodore Frelinghuysen. ''The early Germans of New Jersey: Their History, Churches, and Genealogies''. (Dover, New Jersey, Dover Printing Company, 1895), passim.</ref> Often villages established and settled by German emigrants remained culturally German well into the Nineteenth Century, with German [[Lutheran]] and [[German Reformed Church|Reformed]] churches (often as "Union" churches) established shortly after the first settlements (as was the case in Knowlton and in Stillwater).  However, by the early Nineteenth Century, many descendants of these German settlers removed to newly-opened lands in the West (i.e. [[Ohio]], the [[Northwest Territory]], the [[Southern Tier]] of New York) and those that remained had assimilated into English-speaking culture, and the German Reformed or Lutheran Churches often became [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]].<ref>Schaeffer, Capser, M.D. and Johnson, William M. ''Memoirs and Reminiscences: Together with Sketches of the Early History of Sussex County, New Jersey.'' (Hackensack, New Jersey: Privately Printed, 1907). 42<U+2013>43, 46<U+2013>47; Chambers, op. cit., passim.</ref> The German cultural impact of this community can still be seen in local architecture&mdash;most notably in barns and in stone houses&mdash;and in [[Cemetery|cemeteries]] containing intricately-carved [[Headstone|gravestones]] often bearing archaic [[German language|German text]] and [[Funeral|funerary]] symbols.<ref>Viet, Richard F.

The area around present-day [[Stillwater, New Jersey|Stillwater]] was first settled by the family of Casper Shafer (1712&ndash;1784), a [[Rhineland-Palatinate|Palatine]] [[Germans|German]] who had emigrated to Philadelphia a few years earlier.  Shafer, with his father-in-law, Johan Peter Bernhardt (?&ndash;1748), and his brother-in-law Johann Georg Windemuth (or John George Wintermute) (1711&ndash;1782), settled at Stillwater in 1742.  Both Shafer and Windemuth were married to Bernhardt's daughters.<ref>Wintermute, Jacob Perry. ''Wintermute Family History''. (Columbus, Ohio: Champlin Press, 1900); Wintermute, Leonard. ''Windemuth Family Heritage''.  (Baltimore, Maryland: Gateway Press, 1996).</ref>  Shafer, who operated a grist mill at Stillwater starting in 1746, transported [[flour]], [[fruit]], and other products by [[flatboat]] down the Paulins Kill and the Delaware River to the market in Philadelphia.  Most of the New Jersey shoreline and cities such as Elizabethtown and Newark were practically unknown to the German settlers along the Paulins Kill who learned of the existence of these cities only through trade with the local Lenni Lenape.<ref>Schaeffer and Johnson. op. cit., 33.; Snell, op. cit., passim.</ref> Part of this was because of the incredible hardship of an overland journey east to these cities resulting from a lack of roads.  

The first road connecting Elizabethtown, and [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] with settlements along the Delaware River, was the [[Military Road (New Jersey)|Military Road]] built by Jonathan Hampton (1711<U+2013>1777) in 1755<U+2013>1756.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/dewa/InDepth/Sites/Military.html Military Trail] at Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area website, no further authorship information given, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref> This road, which crosses the Paulins Kill at present-day Baleville, in Hampton Township, was built to supply fortifications built in the Delaware valley at this time to protect New Jersey during the [[French and Indian War]]. Very few passable, large roads were built in this section of New Jersey, then largely a sparsely-populated wilderness, before the creation of turnpike companies in the early decades of the Nineteenth Century.  During much of the mid-eighteenth century, trade in the northwestern reaches of New Jersey was conducted through Philadelphia by way of the Delaware River.<ref>Schaeffer and Johnson, loc. cit.</ref>

About the year 1760, [[Mark Thomson]] (1739<U+2013>1803) settled in Hardwick Township (now Frelinghuysen Township) and erected a gristmill and sawmill on the Paulins Kill.  The settlement that arose was later named Marksboro in his honour.  Thomson, who removed to [[Changewater, New Jersey|Changewater]] in [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]], became an officer in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolution]], and served two terms in the House of Representatives.<ref>Snell, op. cit., passim.</ref>

===Commercial and industrial impact===
[[Image:October 2006 021.jpg|thumb|right|The Paulinskill or Hainesburg Viaduct, built 1908 to 1911, carried the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad across the Paulins Kill Valley on the Lackawanna Cut-Off.]]
From the standpoint of [[conservation]], the Paulins Kill has benefited from having remained chiefly a pastoral river in a largely undeveloped area of New Jersey. No significant industry had developed since the 1740s to cause irreversible damage to the flow of the river or to heavily [[pollution|pollute]] its waters.  During this time, the river was dammed to provide power to the only industries established in these small rural towns:  [[Gristmill|grist]], [[Sawmill|saw]], [[Expeller|oil]], and [[fulling mill]]s.<ref>Snell, op. cit., passim.</ref> Many of the dams that once powered the mills, and the electrical power plant at [[Branchville, New Jersey|Branchville]] established in 1903, have been breached, or no longer impede the flow of the river.<ref>[http://www.branchville-nj.com/ Branchville, New Jersey - History], no further authorship information given, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref>

Columbia, a hamlet near the mouth of the Paulins Kill in [[Knowlton Township, New Jersey|Knowlton Township]], was known for a large [[glass]] manufacturing factory. Near Columbia, the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] also constructed the [[Paulinskill Viaduct]] (known also as the ''Hainesburg Viaduct''), a bridge crossing the Paulins Kill along the [[Lackawanna Cut-Off]] rail corridor.  Begun in 1908, this bridge was deemed an [[engineering]] marvel for its use of [[reinforced concrete]].  Spanning 1,100&nbsp;feet (335&nbsp;m) across the Paulins Kill Valley, the Viaduct rises 115&nbsp;feet (35&nbsp;m) above the valley floor, and opened for rail traffic in 1911.<ref>Cunningham, John T.

However, despite its rural character, the Paulins Kill is still impacted by [[pollution]], chiefly through nearby [[residential development]]s and farm [[surface runoff|run-off]] (agricultural [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s), known as "non-point pollution."  Several [[farm]]s are located along the banks of the Paulins Kill, raising crops including such grain-producing grasses as [[alfalfa]], [[wheat]], [[corn]], [[hay]] (and historically [[barley]], [[buckwheat]] and [[rye]]). Fruit trees in [[orchard]]s produce [[cherries]], [[apple]], [[plum]], [[peach]] and [[pear]], while native wild [[grape]] vines, and [[Blackberry]] bushes are also found in the valley.<ref>Schaeffer and Johnson, loc. cit.</ref>

The [[PIRG|New Jersey Public Interest Research Group]] (NJPIRG) has ranked the Paulins Kill as the seventh in a collection of rivers and creeks in a Top 30 listing of ''New Jersey waterways to Save''<ref>[http://www.njpirg.org/NJ.asp?id2=4789&id3=NJ& Defend New Jersey Waters Releases List Of Top 30 Waterways To Save] (Press Release), [[21 November]] [[2001]] at the NJPIRG website, no further authorship information given, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref> Also, New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection often brings civil actions against local firms that deliberately pollute in the Paulins Kill watershed, most recently levying a $121,500 fine against a Sussex County shopping mall owner who discharged pollutants from a sewage treatment facility into the main branch near Newton, New Jersey between 1996 and 1998.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/newsrel/releases/02_0061.htm NJ DEP Attains Settlement Over Water Pollution Violations affecting Paulinskill River] (Press Release) at NJDEP website, no further authorship information given, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref>  

Recent development, prompted by an enlarging New York City Metropolitan area, has led to development issues which could threaten the Paulins Kill's future.  A public sewer and water project in Branchville, New Jersey was halted in the 2000 out of concern for a population of [[Dwarf wedgemussel]]s (''Alasmidonta heterodon''), an endangered species.  This project was reauthorized in 2002.<ref>"Branchville Sewer Plant May Still Be Built" by Jamie Goldenbaum in ''New Jersey Herald'' ([[16 April]] [[2002]]), transcribed at [http://www.srk.hk/i/news/activist/part1/branchville-sewer-plant-may-built.asp?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=4620 http://www.srk.hk/i/news/activist/part1/branchville-sewer-plant-may-built.asp?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=4620], accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref> The Paulins Kill is also home to a wide variety of amphibians, including the [[Spotted Salamander]], [[Red Spotted Newt]], [[American Toad]], [[Fowlers Toad]], [[Bullfrog|American Bull Frog]] and others.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/chkamph.htm New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection: Division of Fish and Wildlife: Amphibians of New Jersey], no further authorship information given, accessed [[20 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

==Today==
[[Image:Paulinskill stillwater angling.jpg|thumb|right|The Paulins Kill is a popular destination for anglers in search of several species of Trout.]]

The Paulins Kill continues to maintain its rural character through both local concern and government policy.  It is an excellent area for [[birdwatching]], [[canoeing]], [[hiking]], [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], and is considered to be one of the best [[trout]] streams in New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/trtartjs.htm "Trout Fishing in New Jersey - The Good 'Ole Days are Now!"] by Jim Sciascia at New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife website, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref>  As in the past, the Paulins Kill Valley remains rural, and the landscape is dotted with many horse and [[Dairy farming|dairy farms]] along its entire length.

===Fishing===
The Paulins Kill is a popular fishing destination for various species of [[trout]]&mdash;mostly [[Rainbow Trout]], [[Brown Trout]] and [[Brook Trout]]&mdash;many of which are stocked each year during fishing season by New Jersey's Division of Fish & Wildlife, while others are found wild. The river owes its [[fly fishing]] reputation largely to the prolific populations of various species of the [[mayfly]] and [[caddisfly]].<ref>[http://www.njskylands.com/odfishfly.htm Music to a Hare's Ears] by Henry Bell in ''Skylands Magazine, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref> Historically, the Paulins Kill was known to be populated with [[American Shad]], but with the construction of mill dams across the river in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the population of Shad were unable to spawn in the river.<ref>Cummings, Warren D. ''Sussex County: A History'' (Newton, New Jersey: Newton Rotary Club, 1964). transcribed [http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/NJSUSSEX/2002-09/1032918263 http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/NJSUSSEX/2002-09/1032918263], accessed [[26 October]] [[2006]].</ref>  Shad can still be found in the Delaware River.<ref>[http://www.delawareriver.net/shad.php Fishing for Shad on the Delaware] at Delaware River Recreation, no further authorship information given, accessed [[29 October]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Protected areas===
The Paulins Kill valley contains many protected areas. [[Swartswood State Park]], established in 1914 as the first and oldest state park in New Jersey, is on 2,272&nbsp;acres (919&nbsp;ha) just north of the Paulins Kill Lake in Sussex County.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/swartswood.html Swartswood State Park], official website, no further authorship information given, accessed [[20 December]] [[2006]]</ref> Along Kittatinny Ridge in the northern part of the watershed are parts of [[Worthington State Forest]] (west), [[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]] (central), and [[Stokes State Forest]]s (east).<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/worthington.html Worthington State Forest], official website, no further authorship information given, accessed [[20 December]] [[2006]]</ref><ref>[http://www.nps.gov/dewa/ National Park Service: Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area], official website, no further authorship information given, accessed [[20 December]] [[2006]]</ref><ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/stokes.html Stokes State Forest], official website, no further authorship information given,  accessed [[20 December]] [[2006]]</ref> In addition to these state forests, the Paulins Kill valley is host to a variety of common [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] and [[deciduous]] trees, which have been harvested for [[lumber]] in the past, including: [[White Oak|White]] and [[Black Oak]], [[American Sycamore|Buttonwood]], [[Eastern Red Cedar]], [[Eastern Hemlock]], [[American Chestnut]], [[Black Walnut]], [[Tamarack Larch]], [[Spruce]], and [[Pine]]. Trees that add to the beauty of the fall foliage include [[Maple]], [[Birch]], [[Hickory]], [[Elm]], and [[Crab Apple]].<ref>Schaeffer and Johnson, op. cit., 45 ff.</ref>

New Jersey's [[Green Acres (New Jersey)|Green Acres]] program has targeted the Paulins Kill and its surrounding valley as an excellent natural resources for open space and farmland preservation and recreational opportunities.  The state, working together with agricultural development boards in Sussex and Warren Counties, and with the ''Ridge and Valley Conservancy'', a local nonprofit land trust, share land acquisition costs to enter tracts of real estate into the program.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/greenacres/currentstate.htm State Acquisitions Current Projects, Green Acres Program, NJ Department of Environmental Protection] no further authorship information given, accessed [[24 August]] [[2006]].</ref>  Since 1983, several farms across New Jersey have sold development rights to the county programs.  Sussex County has permanently preserved 12,242.39&nbsp;acres (4,954.32&nbsp;ha) of woodland and farmland.<ref>[http://www.sussex.nj.us/documents/planning/farmland/Preserved%20Farms.pdf Preserved Farmland in Sussex County (NJ)], spreadsheet from the County of Sussex (New Jersey) no further authorship information given, accessed [[30 October]] [[2006]].</ref>  Likewise, Warren County has preserved 100 farm properties, comprising over 12,200&nbsp;acres (4,937&nbsp;ha).<ref>[http://www.co.warren.nj.us/wn/12-15-2004.html Preserved Farms in Warren County Hit 100] (2004 Press Release) Warren County (NJ), no further authorship information given, accessed [[30 October]] [[2006]].</ref> 

In addition, four Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) are in the Paulins Kill valley: Bear Swamp WMA, Trout Brook WMA, White Lake WMA, and Columbia Lake WMA. Together they comprise 6,564&nbsp;acres (2656&nbsp;ha) of protected lands, mostly acquired through "Green Acres" funds.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/wmaland.htm New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection: Wildlife Management Areas], no further authorship information given, accessed [[20 December]] [[2006]].</ref> Hunting and trapping are permitted in season in many of these protected areas. Common game animals include [[White-tailed Deer]], [[Coyote|Eastern Coyote]], [[Red Fox]], [[Gray Fox]], [[Opossum]], [[Eastern Cottontail|Eastern Cottontail Rabbit]], [[Raccoon]], [[Gray Squirrel|Gray]] and [[Red Squirrel]], [[Beaver]], [[Muskrat]], and[[Woodchuck]] or Groundhog. Common game birds include [[Ring-necked Pheasant]], [[Eastern Wild Turkey]], [[American Crow]], and [[Canada Goose]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/smgame_info.htm New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection: Division of Fish and Wildlife: Small Game Hunting in New Jersey], no further authorship information given, accessed [[20 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Hiking===
The [[Paulinskill Trail|''Paulinskill Valley Trail'']]&mdash;a network of trails along abandoned railroad beds of the [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway|New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad]]&mdash;have been transformed and maintained for [[hiking]], [[horseback riding]], and other recreational uses, stretches for 27&nbsp;miles (44&nbsp;km) from [[Sparta Township, New Jersey|Sparta Junction]] in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]] to [[Knowlton Township, New Jersey|Columbia]] in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], roughly following the entire length of the river.  After the New York, Susquehanna and Western decommissioned the route in 1962, the right-of-way along this corridor was purchased by the City of Newark the following year.  Newark hoped to use the bed for a water pipeline connecting to the proposed [[Tocks Island|dam and reservoir project]] on the [[Delaware River]].  However, this project&mdash;controversial from the start because of environmental concerns and the federal government's abuse of eminent domain&mdash;was cancelled during the 1970s.  Newark sold their claim to the corridor in 1992 to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection for $600,000, and the Paulinskill Valley Trail was created.<ref>[http://www.railtrails.org/find/totm/archives/04-06.asp Paulinskill Valley Trail at Rails-to-Trail Conservancy], no further authorship information given,  accessed [[24 August]] [[2006]].</ref> The [[Appalachian Trail]] follows the top of Kittatiny Ridge at the northern edge of the valley.<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/worthington.html Worthington State Forest], official website, no further authorship information given, accessed [[December 20]] [[2006]]</ref>
