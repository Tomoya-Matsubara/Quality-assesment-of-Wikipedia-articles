The [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] '''Branch''' hieroglyph, also called a '''Stick''',<ref>Kamrin, 2004. ''Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Practical Guide'', Appendix C, ''Key to Sign List, M. Vegetation'', M3, stick, p. 241.</ref> is a member of the trees and plants hieroglyphs.

The branch is an [[Egyptian language]] [[Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral]] with the value ''(kh)t'', (khet); it is an [[ideogram]]-([[determinative]]),<ref>Schumann-Antelme, and Rossini, ''Biliterals'', (B1-B83), ''B23, khet'', p. 118-119. </ref> for wood, tree, and the linear measure (=100 cubits).<ref>Schumann-Antelme, and Rossini, p. 118. </ref> The hieroglyph is described as a branch without leaves.

<div>As the value (kh)t, it is often complemented in a [[quadrat (hieroglyph block)|hieroglyphic block]] with ''kh''  <hiero>Aa1</hiero>, and ''"t"'' <hiero>X1</hiero>.</div>

==Iconographic usage==

===Pharaonic usage===
Pharaoh [[Nectanebo II]] used the branch hieroglyph for his [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|Nomen]] name of ''Nakhthoreb'', "Strong is His Lord, Beloved of [[Hathor]]".

Pharaoh [[Nectanebo I]]'s nomen was ''Nekhtnebef'', "Strong is His Lord."

===Old Kingdom usage===
[[File:EbonyLabelOfDen-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Object label of Pharaoh [[Den (Pharaoh)|Den]]. ]]

Two labels are known from the [[Old Kingdom]] showing usage of the ''branch hieroglyph'', one by Pharaoh [[Den (pharaoh)|Den]], one by [[Semerkhet]]. The usage on the labels shows the branch hieroglyph in a more archaic form.

===Rosetta Stone usage of branch--"khet"===
In the 198 BC [[Rosetta Stone]] the ''branch hieroglyh'' is used six times, lines R1 combined with N23-(the Nabayrah Stele), R5, R6, R9, R13 and R14.<ref>Budge, 1989, (1929), ''The Rosetta Stone,'' p. 147-169. </ref>

The Rosetta Stone usage of the hieroglyph is somewhat distinctive:

:<div>''line R1''&ndash;<hiero>M3:X1*Z1</hiero>"kh-t", <br>".... Were brought some of them (rebels) into White Wall ([[Memphis, Egypt]]-"Aneb-Hetch-t"), at the festival of the receiving behold of the kingdom from his father, slaying by placing [them] upon '''stakes['''s''']'''."<ref>Budge, 1989, (1929), p. 147.</ref>

:<div>''line R5''&ndash;<hiero>N35:M3:Aa1*X1-Z9:D40</hiero>"nekh-t" for ''"might"''-(''Nike'', as the goddess of Victory: Greek [[Nike (goddess)|Nike]])<br>''".... As a reward for these things have given him ([[Ptolemy V]]) the gods and goddesses: victory, '''might''', life, strength, health, ([[ankh wedja seneb|AUS]]) and everything good to the fullest possible extent of them;..."''<ref>Budge, 1989, (1929), p. 152-3.</ref><div>
:<div>''line R6''&ndash;Same usage of '''might''', but instead ''strong'':<br>".... Ptolemy, the Avenger of Baq-t the interpretation whereof is'' '''Ptolemy, the''' '''''strong one''''' '''of [[km (hieroglyph)|Kam-t]]'''-(Egypt)..."''<ref>Budge, 1989, (1929), p. 155.</ref><div>
:<div>''line R9''&ndash;Used in a prepositional phrase: ''"em-khet"'', literally vertical letter "M"-(vertical form of Gardiner U31, unlisted) with the branch hieroglyph.
:<div>''lines R13/R14''&ndash;<hiero>M3:Aa1*X1-D40-Z7:X1-(ros-line13)</hiero>-"khet-tu", (both lines reconstructed except "-tu" of R13). ''"To inscribe"'', upon the priest's rings, and on the Rosetta Stone, (i.e. the [[Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy V)]]), in the three scripts: Egyptian hieroglyphs, [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Egyptian Demotic]], and the [[Greek language|Greek]] language.<div>

==Variant forms==
<div>One common variant form of the branch hieroglyph is combined with the tree, M1, <hiero>M1</hiero>, and <hiero>M3</hiero> in a [[typographic ligature|ligature]], Gardiner Aa40, <hiero>Aa40</hiero>, (there is also an Aa41 with the tree). </div>

A wall relief inside the Great Temple of Abu Simbel shows Ramses II smiting Libyans. Young Ramses in a chariot is shown on the left, bow drawn, charging into Syrian ranks.<ref>Time-Life Books, 1993. ''[[Ramses II]]: Magnificence on the Nile,'' "From the series of reliefs...", photo caption, p. 28, (28-29). </ref> On the right he is standing over one prone Libyan fighter, and is smiting another with a mace-club in his right hand, while holding the Libyan fighter with his extended left arm. The extensive military scenes are commemmorating his military victories,<ref>Time-Life Books, 1993. p. 28, (28-29). </ref> and the text explains the specifics of the events.

Above the clasped Libyan fighter is one column of text, (out of a series of about 15 columns, variable in height), describing the "victory-buildings", the strongholds that the captives will be confined in. The text explains that Ramses and the Egyptian army went after three groups of rebels, and then confined them.

<div>Above the Libyan captive's arm is a column of text,<ref>wikipedia commons photo, Egypt-Abu Simbel (Ramses II with Libyan).</ref> (see here: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Egypt_Abou_Simbel6.jpg]), and the columns states: "...the 'strong-buildings', ...constructed by pharaoh,..." The last two hieroglyphs in the vertical text shows a vertical wall hieroglyph and constructing-man, and the horizontal [[djsr (arm with powerstick)|arm holding a "power scepter"]], (showing an action of force by one's arm-(hands), i.e. the constructing of the wall, the "stronghold" building). The hieroglyphs are Gardiner A35-(with foot raised onto side of wall-(variation)), <hiero>A35</hiero>, D40-(arm showing action of forse: Egyptian language: ''"djser"'', for 'power'). <hiero>D40</hiero> Combinded they are: <hiero>A35:D40</hiero>.
