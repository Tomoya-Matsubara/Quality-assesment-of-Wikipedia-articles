'''Bahram-e Pazhdo''', meaning Bahram (son) of Pazhdo, was a [[Zoroastrian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet of the 13th century.

Bahram-e Pazhdo's only surviving work is his ''Bahariyyat'' "Spring", a 330-couplet composition, in [[hazaj meter]], that dates to 1257. The poem celebrates the spring season, the Iranian new year festival [[Nowruz]], the prophet [[Zoroaster]], the praise of Kings and leaders who upheld or propagated the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion, the [[ashavan|righteous deceased]] of that faith, as well as those who might copy his poem.  According to Professor Jaleh Amuzegar, the ''Bahariyyat'' "has little literary merit and is poorly composed."<ref name="EIr">{{citation|last=Amuzegar|first=J.|chapter=Bahram Pazhdu|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=3|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f5/v3f5a046.html}}</ref>

The oldest surviving copy of the ''Bahariyyat'' is in a greater collection that dates to 1653-1655. That edition of the ''Bahariyyat'', dated 1654, covers folios 219-223 of the 512-folio codex. As of 1989,<ref name="EIr" /> the compendium was in the custody of the Public Library<!-- capitalized, that is the proper name of that library --> in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]].

Bahram-e Pazhdo was the father of [[Zartosht_Bahram_e_Pazhdo|Zartosht Bahram]], composer of the better-known ''Zartosht-nama''. In the son's verse adaptation of the ''[[Book of Arda Viraf]]'' and which immediately precedes the father's poem in the above-mentioned 512-folio codex, Bahram-e Pazhdo is described as a writer (''dabir''), as a man of letters (''adib''), as a priest (''[[herbad]]'') and astronomer, and as someone who wrote good poetry in [[Middle Persian]] and in [[New Persian]].
