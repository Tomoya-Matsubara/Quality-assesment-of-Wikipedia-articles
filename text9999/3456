'''Creoda''' (or '''Crida''') (c. [[540]]<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup> - [[593]]) was the first monarch of [[Mercia]] (c. [[585]] - [[593]]).

Creoda is recorded as having been the son of [[Cynewald]], the grandson of [[Cnebba]], and the great-grandson of [[Icel (person)|Icel]]; consequently, members of the Mercian royal line were known as [[Iclinga]]s.  Although this suggests that Creoda was only a fourth-generation descendant of the first [[Angles]] in [[England]], the sources nevertheless record him as having been the first ruler of the Kingdom of Mercia. One explanation for this is that the Mercians had initially settled further east and only moved into the area of what became known as Mercia in the time of Creoda.

Like most of the early [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kings, very little is known about his life. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records his death in the year 593.

# Or circa [[520]].  [[Google]] returns 148 results for Creoda being born c. 540 [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&as_qdr=all&q=creoda+540&btnG=Search] and 136 results for his birth at c. 520 [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&as_qdr=all&q=creoda+520&btnG=Search]. c. 520 is relatively implausible given that his father, Cynewald, was born c. 512.
