The '''Tin [or Teen] Bigha Corridor''' ({{lang-bn|<U+09A4><U+09BF><U+09A8><U+09AC><U+09BF><U+0998><U+09BE> <U+0995><U+09B0><U+09BF><U+09A1><U+09B0>}}) is a strip of land belonging to [[India]] on the [[West Bengal]]<U+2013>[[Bangladesh]] border, which in September, 2011, was leased to Bangladesh so that it can access its Dahagram<U+2013>Angarpota enclaves. <ref>[http://www.nenanews.com/NEE%20%20Sept.22%20-%20Oct.%206,%2003/Cover%20Story.htm Cover story]</ref> 

==Facts==
According to the Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Mujibur Rahman treaty of 1974, [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] were to hand over the sovereignty of the Tin Bigha Corridor (178 x 85 sq m) and South Berubari (7.39 sq km) to each other, thereby allowing access to the Dahagram<U+2013>Angarpota enclaves and the Indian enclaves adjacent to South Berubari.  Bangladesh did hand over the sovereignty of the larger South Berubari to India instantly in 1974. India, however, refused to transfer the much smaller Tin Bigha Corridor to [[Bangladesh]]. <ref><http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2009/09/24/79555.html></ref><ref><http://www.banglapedia.org/httpdocs/HT/E_0054.HTM></ref>

After much [[Bangladesh]] government protest, [[India]], instead of handing over sovereignty in 2011, proposed to lease the Tin Bigha Corridor to [[Bangladesh]] for a certain time. South Berubari, meanwhile, would remain in the possession of [[India]].

==Etymology==

''Tin'' is the word for the numeral "three" in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and [[bigha]] is a unit of area ranging from 1,500 to 6,771 sq m.

Following a treaty signed by the Prime Ministers of [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] on September 6, 2011 in [[Dhaka]], it was agreed that the corridor would be open for 24 hours for [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]]s in the enclave to access the mainland.<ref name=24hr>{{cite news|title=Tin Bigha corridor to remain open 24 hours|url=http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=537ca67a1852ec7e93feda1fa86a3a05&nttl=2011090724619|accessdate=7 September 2011|newspaper=Bangla News 24|date=6 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=24hr1>{{cite news|title=Transit tumbles into Teesta abyss|url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?cid=52&id=205307&hb=4|accessdate=7 September 2011|newspaper=bdnews24.com|date=7 September 2011}}</ref>
