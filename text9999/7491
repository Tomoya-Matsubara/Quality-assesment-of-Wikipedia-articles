'''William Julius Coleman''' (March 8, 1869 &ndash; September 2, 1934) was an [[American football]] player and coach, as well as a [[Rowing (sport)|collegiate rower]] and track & field athlete. He was the first coach for the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas football team]], when he served as a player-coach in 1890. He also competed on the KU rowing team, winning the 1 mile 2 man rowing competition along with Charles Orton Lasley in 1892 with a time of 6:04.<ref name="Kansas1">{{cite book | title=Quivira | year=1893 | publisher=[[University of Kansas]] Class of '93 Board of Publication | location=Lawrence, Kansas | page=157 | accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> Will was a track & field athlete while at KU, as well. He ran both the 100 yard dash and the 1 mile, coming in 2nd in the 100 yard dash and 1st in the mile with a time of 5 minutes and 19.5 seconds at the 1892 official KU Field Day.<ref name="Kansas2">{{cite book | title=Quivira | year=1893 | publisher=[[University of Kansas]] Class of '93 Board of Publication | location=Lawrence, Kansas | page=143 | accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life and playing career==
Coleman was born in 1869 in Kentucky to Leonidas William Coleman(July 20, 1842&ndash;1929) and Fena Coleman. At the age of one his family moved from Kentucky to rural [[Chase County, Kansas]] just outside of [[Strong City, Kansas|Strong City]]<ref name=Census1>{{cite census |title=1870 United States Census |year=1870 |location=Toledo Township, Chase County, Kansas |page=1 |line=27 |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> where he went on to become an athletic star at Chase County high school in [[Cottonwood Falls, Kansas]]. After graduating from Chase County high school he attended the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] where he played football from 1890 through 1894. He was the starting center and lettered all five years he was at KU. 

For several years during Coleman's time at Kansas, KU ran what was known as the [[Flying wedge#Sports|Flying V]] formation on offense where the center, Will's position, is the point of the "V" leading the way for the ball carrier and other blockers and takes the brunt of the punishment from defensive players. This formation proved so dangerous and lead to so many severe injuries that it was later banned in both collegiate and pro football.<ref name=Football>{{cite web |url=http://footballencyclopedia.com/cfeintro.htm Introduction: A Brief History of College Football |title=Introduction: A Brief History of College Football |publisher=College Football Encyclopedia |accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
Will Coleman coached the Jayhawks in what is widely considered the [[1890 Kansas vs. Baker football game|first college football game]] played in the state of Kansas.<ref name="kshs">{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-college-football-in-kansas/12834|publisher=Kansas Historical Quarterly|title=College Football in Kansas|first=Harold|last=Evans|date=August 1940|pages=285<U+2013>311|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref> As listed by the [[College Football Data Warehouse]], he served as the first head coach for the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas football team]], coaching for a single season in 1890 and tallying a mark of 1&ndash;2.<ref name=CFDW>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/kansas/yearly_results.php?year=1890|publisher=[[College Football Data Warehouse]]|accessdate=September 11, 2012|title=Kansas Yearly Results}}</ref> The team actually went 2&ndash;1 on the field, but their last game against Baker University, which was initially won by KU with a score of 14 to 12, was awarded to Baker on a technicality.<ref name="Kansas">{{cite book | title=Quivira | year=1893 | publisher=[[University of Kansas]] Class of '93 Board of Publication | location=Lawrence, Kansas | page=149 | accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> 

The 1890 Kansas Jayhawks football team was not officially associated with the [[University of Kansas]].  Coleman was not an employee or a faculty member of the University of Kansas, but instead a KU student who played [[Center (American football)|center]] on the football team. The first Jayhawks football coach recognized by the University of Kansas was faculty member [[Edwin Mortimer Hopkins]], who helmed the team the next season in 1891.

==Later life and death==
Will Coleman met Lawrence native Eliza May Rush (January 6, 1867&ndash;May 16, 1939) while attending KU. They later married in 1895 upon his graduation from the University of Kansas. They had a daughter, Margaret Rush Coleman in 1896. Margaret latter married Robert Bell Rose, the grandson of Dr. Simeon Bishop Bell (May 13, 1820 &ndash; January 16, 1913), a Wyandotte County doctor and real estate speculator who donated $100,000 in cash and land to the University of Kansas for the purpose of founding KU Med Center and the [[University of Kansas Hospital]] in [[Rosedale, Kansas]].

Will's first job after college was as the superintendent of [[Haskell Indian Nations University]], also located in Lawrence, Kansas. He held this job for more than 15 years before changing careers and becoming a traveling salesman in 1910. In 1918 he moved his family to Kansas City, Missouri until later moving to Mission, Kansas and then Overland Park, Kansas where he eventually passed away in 1934. His wife, May Coleman, would die in 1939 while under the care of another important KU football figure, [[John H. Outland|Dr. John H. Outland]]. Both Will Coleman and his wife May are buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas.
