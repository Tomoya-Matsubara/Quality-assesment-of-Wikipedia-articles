'''Dundee''' ({{lang-gd|D<U+00F9>n D<U+00E8>agh}}) is the fourth largest [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[Scotland]] with a population of 143,090.  It is located on the north bank of the [[River Tay|River Tay's]] estuary and so is near the east coast and the [[North Sea]]. Dundee is known as the ''City of Discovery'', both in honour of Dundee's history of scientific activities, and of the [[RRS Discovery]], [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] exploration vessel, which was built in Dundee and is now berthed there.

Its history began with the [[Picts]] in the [[Iron age]] and during the medieval period included several hostilities. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the local [[jute]] industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period Dundee also gained a reputation for its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its epithet as the city of "jam, jute and journalism". Dundee's population reached a peak of nearly 200,000 at the start of the 1970s, but it has since declined due to outward migration and a falling birth rate. 

The biomedical and technology industries have grown since the 1980s and the city now accounts for 10% of Britain<U+2019>s digital entertainment industry. The city is also famous for being the home of [[William McGonagall]], who is widely known as the "world's worst poet". The city is home to the [[Scottish Dance Theatre]], who are based in the city's [[Dundee Repertory Theatre]], and the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], which regularly plays in the city's Caird Hall. On [[5 March]], [[2004]] Dundee was granted [[Fairtrade Town|Fairtrade City]] status.<ref>{{cite press release

==History==
{{main|History of Dundee}}
Dundee first became a settlement when the [[Picts]] settled the area 3,500 years ago. At the time the area was known by the Pictish name of '''Alec-tum'''.<ref>{{cite book | first=Hector | last=Boece|title=History of the Scottish People|year=1527 }}</ref> The name "Dundee" was later adopted from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] D<U+00F9>n D<U+00E8>agh, meaning "Fort on the Tay". In 1191 [[Common Era|CE]], the town was awarded a [[charter]] making it a [[royal burgh]].<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite book

}}</ref> This charter was later revoked by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], though it was replaced by a new charter from [[Robert the Bruce]] in 1327. Dundee became a walled city in 1545, owing to a period of hostilities known as the [[rough wooing]]. In July 1547, much of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment. In 1645, during the [[Scottish Civil War|Scottish civil war]], Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]].<ref name="Gazetteer" /> In 1651 during the [[Third English Civil War]], it was invaded by [[General Monck]], who was the commander of [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell's]] forces in Scotland. These [[Parliament of England|English Parliamentarians]] destroyed much of the city and killed many of its inhabitants. Dundee was later the site of an early [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] uprising when [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee]] raised the [[Stuart]] standard on [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]] in support of [[James II of England|James VII (James II of England)]] following his overthrow, earning him the nickname [[Bonnie Dundee]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> By the end of the 19th century, a majority of the city's workers were employed in its many jute mills and in related industries. Dundee's location on a major estuary allowed for the easy importation of jute from the [[Indian subcontinent]] and of [[whale oil]] &mdash; needed for the processing of the jute &mdash; from the city's large [[whaling]] industry. The industry began to decline in the 20th century as it became cheaper to process the cloth on the Indian subcontinent. The city's last jute mill closed in the 1970s. 
[[Image:Tayrailbridge.jpg|thumb|250px|The original Tay Bridge (from the south) the day after the disaster. The collapsed section can be seen near the northern end]]
In addition to jute the city is also known for [[jam]] and [[journalism]]. The "jam" association refers to [[marmalade]], which was purportedly invented in the city by [[Janet Keiller]] in 1797 (although in reality, recipes for marmalade have been found dating back to the 1500s). [[Keiller's marmalade]] became a famous brand because of its mass production and its worldwide export. However, the industry was never a major employer compared with the jute trade.<ref name="jam">{{cite web

Dundee also developed a major maritime and shipbuilding industry in the 19th Century. 2,000 ships were built in Dundee between 1871 and 1881, including the Antarctic research ship used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]], the ''[[RRS Discovery]]''. This ship is now on display at Discovery Point in the city, and the Victorian steel-framed works in which Discovery's engine was built is now home to the city's largest bookstore.<ref>{{cite book

Dundee's population increased substantially with the urbanisation of the Industrial Revolution as did other British cities. The most significant influx occurred in the mid-1800s with the arrival of [[Ireland|Irish]] workers fleeing from the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845<U+2013>1849)|Potato Famine]] and attracted by industrialisation.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The city also attracted immigrants from [[Italy]] and [[Poland]] in the 19th and 20th Centuries, although Dundee did not experience post-[[World War II]] immigration on the same scale as other cities. Nevertheless, Dundee still has a sizable [[ethnic minority]] population. The city's declining industrial base has caused the population to reduce since the start of the 1970s. A 7.3% drop in population occurred between 1991 to 2001 and a decline of further 14.3% (20,674) is predicted from 2005 to 2011.<ref name="population" /> The number of deaths has exceeded the number of births since 1993, with a drop of 19% in births between 1993 and 2003.<ref name="population" /> There has also been an annual net average emigration of 1,000 from 1998 to 2002.<ref name="population" /> Dundee attracts a large number of students (many Irish), so that students account for 14.2% of the population, more than any other Scottish city.<ref name="population" />

The City Churches, [[Dundee Parish Church (St Mary's)]] and the [[Steeple Church]], are the most prominent [[Church of Scotland]] buildings in Dundee. However the [[Presbytery]] of Dundee currently consists of 45 congregations, although many now share a [[Minister (religion)|minister]]. [[Robert Murray McCheyne]], who was the minister of St Peter's ([[Free Church of Scotland]]) from 1838 until his death in 1843, led a significant religious revival in Dundee.<ref>{{gutenberg|no=15251|name=The Biography of Robert Murray M'Cheyne ''by Andrew A. Bonar'}}</ref> There are two [[cathedral]]s in the city &mdash; the St. Paul's ([[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopal]]) and St. Andrew's ([[Roman Catholic]]). A [[Jewish]] community has existed in the city since the 19th century.  The present [[synagogue]] was built in the 1970s. [[Muslim]]s are served by a large [[mosque]], which opened in 2000. The city also has a [[Hindu]] [[mandir]] and [[Sikh]] [[gurdwara]].

===Local government===
Dundee is one of 32 [[Council areas of Scotland|council areas]] of Scotland,<ref name="localgovact" /> represented by the Dundee City Council, a local authority composed of 29 elected [[councillor]]s. Previously the city was a [[Counties of Scotland|county city]] and later a [[Regions and districts of Scotland|district]] of the [[Tayside]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. Council meetings take place in the City Chambers, which opened in 1933 and are located in City Square. The civic head and chair of the council is known as the [[Lord Provost]], a position similar to that of [[mayor]] in other cities. The council executive is based in Tayside House on the banks of the [[River Tay]], but the council recently announced plans to demolish it in favour of new premises (Dundee House) on North Lindsay Street.<ref>[http://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/output/2006/03/15/story8126277t0.shtm ''Long live Dundee House''], [[The Evening Telegraph|Evening Telegraph]] (publisher [[DC Thomson]]), 15 March 2006</ref> [[As of 2006]] the council is controlled by a minority coalition of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Democrats]] of 12 councillors, with the support of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] who have five.

===History===
The period following [[World War II]] was notable for the transformation of the city's economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. [[NCR Corporation]] selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945,<ref name="ncr">{{cite book

}}</ref> primarily because of the lack of damage the city had sustained in the war, good transport links and high productivity from long hours of sunshine. Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on [[June 11]], [[1947]]. A fortnight after the 10th anniversary of the plant, the 250,000<sup>th</sup> cash machine was produced. By the 1960s, NCR had become the principal employer of the city and produced [[Automatic Teller Machine|ATMs]] at several of its Dundee plants.  Magnetic-strip readers for [[cash register]]s and computers were also built in Dundee.<ref name="ncr500">{{cite journal| author=CJP|month=December 7|year=1966| title=First Dundee computer next year| journal=The Courier}}</ref> Astral, a Dundee-based firm that manufactured and sold [[refrigerators]] and [[Clothes dryer|spin dryers]] was merged into [[Morphy Richards]] and rapidly expanded to employ over 1,000 people.<ref name="astral">{{cite web

Employment in Dundee changed dramatically during the 1980s with the loss of nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs due to closure of the shipyards, cessation of carpet manufacturing and the disappearance of the jute trade. In 1983, the first [[Sinclair Research Ltd|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]] [[home computers]] were produced in Dundee by [[Timex Corporation|Timex]]. In the same year the company broke production records, despite a [[sit-in]] by workers protesting job cuts and plans to demolish one of the factory buildings to make way for a supermarket. Timex closed their Dundee plant in 1993 following an acrimonious six month [[industrial dispute]].<ref>{{cite news

===Modern day===
As in the rest of Scotland manufacturing industries are being gradually replaced by a modern [[Mixed economy|mixed economy]], supported by public and private investment and a skilled or semi-skilled workforce, although 13.5% of the workforce still work in the manufacturing sector, higher than the Scottish and UK average, and more than double that of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The main new growth sectors have been [[software development]] and [[biotechnology]] along with retail. The city has a small financial, banking and insurance sector, with 11% of the workforce, smaller than the three larger Scottish cities, for example Edinburgh<U+2019>s banking and finance sector accounts for 33.3% of it<U+2019>s workforce.

In 2005 32 companies employed 250 or more staff these include limited and private companies [[NCR Corporation]], [[Michelin]], [[Tesco]] (although it was announced in [[March]] [[2003]] that they would be closing their distribution centre in the city with the loss of 450 jobs), [[D.

Major employers in the public sector and non profit sector are [[NHS Tayside]], the [[University of Dundee]], [[Tayside Police]], [[Dundee College]], [[Tayside|Tayside Fire Brigade]], [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs|HM Revenue and Customs]], [[University of Abertay Dundee]] and [[Wellcome Trust]].

The largest employers in Dundee are the [[Dundee City Council|city council]] and the [[National Health Service]], which make up over 10% of the city's workforce. The [[biomedical]] and [[biotechnology]] sectors, including start-up biomedical companies arising from university research, employ 1,000 people directly and nearly 2,000 indirectly.<ref name="chembelt">{{cite news

Dundee is served by the [[A90 road|A90]] road which connects the city to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the west, and [[Forfar]] and [[Aberdeen]] in the north. The part of the road that is in the city is a [[dual carriageway]] and forms the city's main bypass on its north side, known as the ''Kingsway''. To the east, the [[A92 road|A92]] connects the city to [[Monifieth]] and [[Arbroath]]. The A92 also connects the city to the county of [[Fife]] on the south side of the Tay estuary via a [[Tay Road Bridge|toll bridge]], although tolls are only charged for southbound traffic heading into Fife. The main southern route around the city is Riverside Drive and Riverside Avenue (the A991), that runs alongside the Tay from a junction with the A90 in the west, to the city centre where it joins the A92 at the bridge.

Dundee has an extensive public bus transport system, with the [[Seagate Bus Station]] serving as the city's main terminus. [[Travel Dundee]] operates most of the intra-city services, with other more rural services operated by [[Strathtay Scottish]]. The city's two main railway stations are the [[Dundee railway station|Dundee (Tay Bridge) Station]], which is situated near the waterfront and the [[Broughty Ferry railway station|Broughty Ferry Station]], which is further east in [[Broughty Ferry]]. Both are on the same [[railway line]], which serves the east coast of Scotland. Passenger services at Dundee are provided by [[First Scotrail]], [[Virgin Cross Country]] and [[GNER]]. There are no freight services that serve the city since Dundee lost its [[Freightliner (UK)|Freightliner]] terminal in the 1980s.
