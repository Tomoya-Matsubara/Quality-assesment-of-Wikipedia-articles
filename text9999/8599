Huntsman School of Business  |author= |date=18 February 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Utah State University]] |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>

==Books==
===''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People''===
{{Main|The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People}}
''[[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]]'', Covey's best-known book, has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication in 1989. (The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies.){{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Covey argues against what he calls "The Personality Ethic", something he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He instead promotes what he labels "The Character Ethic": aligning one<U+2019>s values with so-called "universal and timeless" principles. Covey adamantly refuses to conflate principles and values; he sees principles as external [[natural law]]s, while values remain internal and subjective. Covey proclaims that values govern people's behavior, but principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence via [[independence]] to [[interdependence]].

===''The 8th Habit''===
In 2004, Covey's book ''[[The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness]]'' was published by [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] (an imprint of [[Simon and Schuster]]). It functions as the sequel to ''The Seven Habits''. Covey claims that [[effectiveness]] does not suffice in what he calls "The [[knowledge worker|Knowledge Worker]] Age". He proclaims that "[t]he challenges and complexity we face today are of a different order of magnitude." The 8th habit essentially urges: "Find your voice and inspire others to find theirs..."

===''The Leader in Me''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Covey Book Leader In Me.jpg|100 px|right|Cover of Covey's New Book ''The Leader in Me -- How Schools and Parents Around the World are Inspiring Greatness, One Child at a Time'']] -->
In November 2008, Covey released a new book ''The Leader in Me<U+2014>How Schools and Parents Around the World Are Inspiring Greatness, One Child at a Time''. This book tells the story of how extraordinary schools, parents and business leaders are preparing the next generation to meet the great challenges and opportunities of the 21st Century. ''The Leader in Me'' shows how one elementary school in Raleigh, North Carolina, decided to try incorporating ''The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People'' and other basic leadership skills into their school<U+2019>s curriculum in unique and creative ways. Inspired by the amazing success of Principal Muriel Summers and the teachers and staff of A.B. Combs Elementary School in Raleigh, other schools and parents around the world have adopted the approach and have seen remarkable results.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.franklincovey.com/blog/press-release-7-habits-inspire-teachers-students-worldwide.html |title = The 7 Habits Inspire Teachers & Students Worldwide |author = Press Release |date = Oct 5, 2009 |accessdate = Aug 12, 2011 |quote = The Leader in Me is being used by more than 150 elementary schools in the U.S., Canada, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Hungary and the Philippines.}}</ref>

===Stephen Covey Online Community===
In March 2008 Covey launched the Stephen Covey's Online Community. The site is a mash up of online courses, goal management and social networking. Covey uses it as a place to teach his most recent thoughts and ideas on current topics and self leadership, his books as well as goal setting and reaching. The content is shared via videos, podcasts, printable text and online activities. Users are also able to set personal goals, track their progress and share their progress with others within the community.

Huntsman]] Presidential Chair in Leadership at the Huntsman School of Business at [[Utah State University]]. Huntsman and Covey were longtime friends.
