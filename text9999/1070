The '''Rolls-Royce Merlin''' is a British, liquid-cooled, 27-[[litre]] (1,650&nbsp;[[cubic inch|cu in]]) [[Engine displacement|capacity]], [[V12 engine|V-12]] [[Reciprocating engine|piston]] [[Aircraft engine|aero engine]], designed and built by [[Rolls-Royce Limited]]. Initially known as the '''PV-12''', Rolls-Royce named the engine the ''[[Merlin (bird)|Merlin]]'' following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].<ref name=Gunston137>Gunston 1989, p. 137.</ref>  

The PV-12 first ran in 1933, and a series of rapidly applied developments brought about by wartime needs improved the engine's performance markedly. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the [[Fairey Battle]], [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. More Merlins were made for the four-engined [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bomber than any other aircraft; however, the engine is most closely associated with the Spitfire and powered its maiden flight in 1936.

==Design and development==
===Origin===
In the early 1930s, Rolls-Royce started planning its future aero engine development programme and realised that there was a need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296&nbsp;cu in) [[Rolls-Royce Kestrel|Kestrel]] that had been used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft.<ref>Rubbra 1990, p. 64.</ref> Consequently, work was started on a new 1,100-[[horsepower]] (820&nbsp;[[Watt#kilowatt|kW]])-class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for ''private venture'' as the company received no government money for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a [[Hawker Hart]] ([[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|''K3036'']]) biplane on 21 February 1935.<ref name="Lumsden203">Lumsden 2003, p. 203.</ref> The engine originally used the [[Radiator (engine cooling)#Steam cooling|evaporative cooling]] system then in vogue.  This proved unreliable and when supplies of [[ethylene glycol]] from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.<ref>Mason 1991, p. 168.</ref>

In 1935, the [[Air Ministry]] issued a specification, [[List of Air Ministry specifications|F10/35]], for new [[fighter aircraft]] with a minimum airspeed of 310&nbsp;[[miles per hour]] (500&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]). Fortunately, two designs had been developed: the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and the [[Hawker Hurricane]]; the latter designed in response to another specification, F36/34.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 53.</ref> Both were designed around the PV-12 instead of the Kestrel, and were the only modern British fighters to have been so developed. Production contracts for both aircraft were placed in 1936, and development of the PV-12 was given top priority as well as government funding. Following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey, Rolls-Royce named the engine the ''[[Merlin (bird)|Merlin]]'' after a small, Northern Hemisphere falcon (''Falco columbarius'').{{#tag:ref|The naming tradition was started by managing director, Claude Johnson, in 1915 with the Eagle, Hawk and Falcon engines. There is no connection to King Arthur's [[Merlin (wizard)|legendary magician.]]|group=nb}}<ref name=Gunston137/>

Two more Rolls-Royce engines developed just prior to the war were added to the company's range. The 700-horsepower (500&nbsp;kW) [[Rolls-Royce Peregrine]] was an updated, [[Supercharger|supercharged]] development of their V-12 Kestrel design, while the 1,700-horsepower (1,300&nbsp;kW) 42-litre (2,560 cu in) [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] was based on two joined Peregrines, using a common crankshaft and forming an [[X24 engine|X-24]] cylinder layout. This was to be used in larger aircraft such as the [[Avro Manchester]].<ref name="Lumsden2003 p198, 200">Lumsden 2003, pp. 198<U+2013>200.</ref>

Although the Peregrine appeared to be a satisfactory design, it was never allowed to mature since Rolls-Royce's priority was refining the Merlin. As a result the Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft: the [[Westland Whirlwind (fixed wing)|Westland Whirlwind]] and the [[Gloster F9/37]]. The Vulture was fitted to the [[Hawker Tornado]] and [[Avro Manchester]], but proved unreliable in service.<ref>Lumsden 2003, p. 200.</ref> With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the 1,500-horsepower (1,100&nbsp;kW) range, the Peregrine and Vulture were both cancelled in 1943, and by mid-1943 the Merlin was supplemented in service by the larger [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]].<ref>Rubbra 1990, p. 118.</ref> The Griffon incorporated several design improvements and ultimately superseded the Merlin.

===Development===
Initially the new engine was plagued with problems, such as failure of the accessory gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set.<ref>Rubbra 1990, pp. 64<U+2013>117.</ref> Early production Merlins were also unreliable: common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the [[camshafts]] and the [[crankshaft]] [[main bearing]]s.<ref>Rubbra 1990, pp. 82<U+2013>92.</ref>

====Early engines====
The prototype and developmental engine types were the:

*'''PV-12'''
: The initial design using an evaporative cooling system. Two built, passed Type Testing in July 1934, generating 740&nbsp;horsepower (552&nbsp;kW) at 12,000&nbsp;[[Foot (length)|feet]] (3,657&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) equivalent. First flown 21 February 1935.<ref name="Lumsden203"/>
*'''Merlin B'''
: Two built, ethylene glycol liquid cooling system introduced. "Ramp" [[cylinder head]]s ([[Poppet valve#Internal combustion engine|inlet valves]] were at a 45-[[Degree (angle)|degree]] angle to the cylinder). Passed Type Testing February 1935, generating 950&nbsp;horsepower (708&nbsp;kW) at 11,000&nbsp;feet (3,353&nbsp;m) equivalent.<ref name="Lumsden203"/>
*'''Merlin C'''
: [[Crankcase]] and [[cylinder block]]s became three separate [[Casting (metalworking)|castings]] with bolt-on cylinder heads.<ref name="Lumsden203"/>
*'''Merlin E'''
: Similar to '''C''' with minor design changes. Passed 50-hour civil test in December 1935 generating a constant 955&nbsp;horsepower (712&nbsp;kW) and a maximum rating of 1,045&nbsp;horsepower (779&nbsp;kW). Failed military 100-hour test in March 1936. Powered the Supermarine Spitfire prototype.<ref name="Lumsden204">Lumsden 2003, p. 204.</ref>
[[File:MerlinHead.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A sectioned, parallel valve, aircraft engine cylinder head is shown with colour-coded internal details. Coolant passage ways are painted green; the valves, valve springs, camshaft and rocker arms are also shown.|Parallel valve Merlin cylinder head]]
*'''Merlin F''' ('''Merlin I''') 
: Similar to '''C''' and '''E'''. This became the first production engine; and was designated as the Merlin I. The Merlin continued with the "ramp" head, but this was not a success and only 172 were made. The [[Fairey Battle]] was the first production aircraft to be powered by the Merlin I and first flew on 10 March 1936.<ref name="Lumsden204"/>
*'''Merlin G''' ('''Merlin II''')
: Replaced "ramp" cylinder heads with parallel pattern heads (valves parallel to the cylinder) scaled up from the Kestrel engine. It was first widely delivered as the 1,030-horsepower (770&nbsp;kW) Merlin II in 1938, and production was quickly stepped up.<ref name="Lumsden204"/>

====Production engines====
The Merlin II and III series were the first main production versions of the engine. The Merlin III was manufactured with a "universal" propeller shaft which allowed either [[de Havilland]] or [[Rotol]] manufactured propellers to be used.<ref>Fozard 1991, p. 125.</ref> 

The next major version was the XX which ran on 100 [[Octane rating|octane]] fuel. This allowed higher [[Manifold vacuum|manifold pressures]], which were achieved by increasing the boost from the [[centrifugal type supercharger]]. The Merlin XX incorporated the first of the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in 1,300&nbsp;horsepower (970&nbsp;kW) at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, which allowed the XX and future Merlin variants to run some {{nowrap|70 degrees [[Celsius|C]]}} cooler, was the use of a 70/30% water/glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable [[ethylene glycol]], and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.<ref name = "Fozard 1991, pp.127, 165"> Fozard 1991, pp. 127, 165.</ref> 

The process of improvement continued, with later versions running on further-increased octane ratings, delivering ever higher power. Fundamental design changes were also made to all key components, again increasing the engine's life and reliability. By the end of the war the "little" engine was delivering over 1,600&nbsp;horsepower (1,200&nbsp;kW) in common versions, and as much as 2,060&nbsp;horsepower (1,536&nbsp;kW) in the Merlin 130/131 versions specifically designed for the [[de Havilland Hornet]]. Ultimately, during tests conducted by Rolls-Royce at [[Derby]], Merlin 130 series engines generated over 2,600&nbsp;horsepower (1,939&nbsp;kW).<ref>Flight 1946, p. 93.</ref>

====Basic component overview (Merlin 61)====
''From Jane's'':<ref>Bridgman 1998, pp. 280<U+2013>281.</ref>
;Cylinders
:Twelve cylinders consisting of high-carbon steel liners set in two, two-piece cylinder blocks of cast "R.R.50" [[aluminium alloy]] having separate heads and skirts. Coolant in direct contact with external face of liners. Cylinder heads fitted with cast-iron inlet valve guides, [[phosphor bronze]] exhaust valve guides, and renewable "Silchrome" steel-alloy valve seats. Two diametrically opposed [[spark plug]]s protrude into each [[combustion chamber]].
;Pistons
:Machined from "R.R.59" alloy [[forging]]s. Fully floating hollow [[gudgeon pin]]s of hardened nickel-chrome steel. Three [[Internal combustion engine#Compression|compression]] and one oil-control [[Piston ring|ring]] above the gudgeon pin, and one oil-control ring below.
;Connecting rods
:H-section machined nickel-steel forgings, each pair consisting of a plain and a forked [[Connecting rod|rod]]. The forked rod carries a nickel-steel bearing block which accommodates steel-backed lead-bronze-alloy bearing shells. The "small-end" of each rod houses a floating phosphor bronze [[Bushing|bush]].
;Crankshaft 
:One-piece, machined from a [[Nitriding|nitrogen-hardened]] nickel-chrome [[molybdenum]] steel forging. [[Engine balance|Statically and dynamically balanced]]. Seven main bearings and six throws. 
;Crankcase
:Two aluminium-alloy castings joined together on the horizontal centreline. The upper portion bears the wheelcase, supercharger and accessories; and carries the cylinder blocks, crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead<U+2013>bronze alloy), and part of the housing for the [[Propeller speed reduction unit|airscrew reduction gear]].  The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the oil pumps and filters.
;Wheelcase
:Aluminium casting fitted to rear of crankcase. Houses drives to the camshafts, [[Magneto (electrical)|magnetos]], coolant and oil pumps, [[supercharger]], hand and electric [[Starter motor|starters]], and the electric [[Electrical generator|generator]].
;Valve gear
:Two inlet and two exhaust [[poppet valve]]s of "K.E.965" steel per cylinder.  Both the inlet and exhaust valves have hardened "[[stellite]]d" ends; while the exhaust valves also have [[sodium]]-cooled stems, and heads protected with a "BrightRay" (nickel-chromium) coating. Each valve is kept closed by a pair of concentric [[Coil spring|coil-springs]]. A single, seven-bearing camshaft, located on the top of each cylinder head operates 24 individual steel [[Rocker arm|rockers]]; 12 pivoting from a rocker shaft on the inner, intake side of the block to actuate the exhaust valves, the others pivoting from a shaft on the exhaust side of the block to actuate the inlet valves.

====Technical improvements====
Most of the Merlin's technical improvements resulted from more efficient [[Centrifugal type supercharger|supercharger]]s, designed by [[Stanley Hooker]], and the introduction of aviation spirits with increased [[octane rating]]s. Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to the engine to withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.<ref>Lovesey 1946, pp. 224<U+2013>226.</ref>

=====Ejector exhausts=====
The Merlin consumed an enormous volume of air at full power (equivalent to the volume of a [[single-decker bus]] per minute), and with the exhaust gases exiting at 1,300&nbsp;miles per hour (2,100&nbsp;km/h) it was realised that useful [[thrust]] could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting sideways.[[File:SpitEjectors.JPG|thumb|left|alt=The right side of an uncowled, installed aircraft engine, with details of the exhaust system.|Merlin 55 ejector exhaust detail, Spitfire LF.VB, ''EP120'']] During tests, 70&nbsp;[[Pound-force|pounds-force]] (32&nbsp;[[kilogram-force|kgf]]) thrust at 300&nbsp;miles per hour (480&nbsp;km/h), or roughly 70&nbsp;horsepower (52&nbsp;kW) was obtained which increased the level maximum speed of the Spitfire by 10&nbsp;miles per hour (16&nbsp;km/h) to 360&nbsp;miles per hour (580&nbsp;km/h).<ref>Price 1982, p. 51.</ref> The first versions of the ejector exhausts featured round outlets, while subsequent versions of the system used "fishtail" style outlets which marginally increased thrust and reduced exhaust glare for night flying.

In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|K5054]],'' was fitted with ejector type exhausts. Later marks of the Spitfire used a variation of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high [[altitude]]s, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air [[Lapse rate|temperatures are lower]].<ref>Tanner 1981, A.P.1565E, Vol.1, Section II.</ref> Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.

=====Supercharger=====
Central to the success of the Merlin was the supercharger. [[Cyril Lovesey|A.C. Lovesey]], an engineer who was a key figure in the design of the Merlin, delivered a lecture on the development of the Merlin in 1946; in this extract he explained the importance of the supercharger:
<blockquote>"Coming now to specific development items we can, for convenience, divide them into three general classes:
# Improvement of the supercharger.
# Improved fuels.
# Development of mechanical features to take care of the improvements afforded by (1) and (2).

Dealing with (1) it can be said that the supercharger determines the capacity, or in other words the output, of the engine. The impression still prevails that the static capacity known as the swept volume is the basis of comparison of the possible power output for different types of engine, but this is not the case because the output of the engine depends solely on the mass of air it can be made to consume efficiently, and in this respect the supercharger plays the most important role. This applies equally to any engine but the engine has to be capable of dealing with the greater mass flows with respect to cooling, freedom from detonation and capable of withstanding high gas and inertia loads...During the course of research and development on superchargers it became apparent to us that any further increase in the altitude performance of the Merlin engine necessitated the employment of a two-stage supercharger."<ref>Lovesey 1946, p. 218.</ref></blockquote>

As the Merlin evolved so too did the supercharger; the latter fitting into three broad categories:<ref name= "Lumsden p. 201">Lumsden 2003, p. 201.</ref>
# Single-stage, single-speed gearbox: Merlin I to III, XII, 30, 40, and 50 series.
# Single-stage, two-speed gearbox: experimental Merlin X (1938), Merlin XX (1940<U+2013>1945).
# Two-stage, two-speed gearbox with intercooler: mainly Merlin 60, 70, and 80 series (1942<U+2013>1946).

The Merlin supercharger was originally designed to allow the engine to generate maximum power at an [[altitude]] of about 16,000&nbsp;feet (5,000&nbsp;m). In 1938 Stanley Hooker, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] graduate in applied mathematics, conducted experiments that showed the original intake design was inefficient, limiting the performance of the supercharger:
<blockquote>"Back in 1938 I soon became very familiar with the construction of the Merlin supercharger and carburettor. The engine had been designed to fit the Hurricane and Spitfire fighters, and its length had been compressed as much as possible to match the fore-and-aft balance on these aircraft. Since the supercharger was at the rear of the engine it had come in for pretty severe design treatment, and the air intake duct to the impeller looked very squashed...<ref>Hooker 1984, p. 45.</ref></blockquote>

The function of the supercharger is to compress the fuel/air mixture entering the engine cylinders, and any pressure loss to the [[Centrifugal compressor|impeller]]{{#tag:ref|The impeller was also called the rotor.|group=nb}} would impair the supercharger's efficiency. Hooker designed a new air intake duct with improved flow characteristics which increased maximum power at a higher altitude of over 19,000&nbsp;feet (5800&nbsp;m). He also improved the design of both the impeller, and the diffuser which controlled the airflow to it. These modifications led to the development of the Merlin XX and 45 series.<ref>Hooker 1984, pp. 46<U+2013>50, 52, 235<U+2013>247.</ref>
  
A development of the single-stage supercharger resulted in the Merlin 45M and 55M, both of which incorporated a smaller "cropped" impeller that allowed the engine to develop greater power at low altitudes. A further development was the incorporation of a two-speed drive, designed by the French company [[Farman Aviation Works|Farman]], for the supercharger of the Merlin X.<ref>Lumsden 2003, p. 206.</ref> Rolls-Royce took out a license in 1938 to build the two-speed drive.<ref>Rubbra 1990, p. 71.</ref>

=====Carburettor developments=====
[[File:Packard Merlin V1650 7 3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A rear view of an aircraft piston engine shows details of the induction system. The engine is sitting on a bespoke wooden pallet.|Carburettor, supercharger and intercooler detail of a preserved Packard V-1650-7 (Merlin 66)]]
The use of [[Carburetor|carburettors]] was calculated to give a higher [[specific power]] output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems.<ref>Hooker 1984, p. 62.</ref> However, the Merlin's lack of direct [[fuel injection]] meant that both [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] were unable to [[Flight dynamics|pitch]] nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf-109E]], which had direct fuel injection, could "bunt" into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been forced out of the carburettor's float chamber by the effects of negative [[g-force]] (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to "half-roll" their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents.<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 205.</ref> "[[Miss Shilling's orifice]]",{{#tag:ref|Invented in March 1941 by [[Beatrice Shilling]], an engineer at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]], Farnborough.|group=nb}} a holed diaphragm fitted across the float chambers, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a "fuel rich" mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet from the bottom of the [[SU carburetor|S.U. carburettor]] to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.<ref>Smallwood 1996, p. 135.</ref>

Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw the introduction of a [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix-Stromberg]] [[pressure carburetor|pressure carburettor]] that injected fuel at 5&nbsp;[[pounds per square inch]] (0.34&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|bar]]) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.<ref>Lumsden 2003, p. 212.</ref>

=====Improved fuels=====
At the start of the war the engine ran on the then standard 87 octane [[avgas|aviation spirit]] and could supply just over 1,000&nbsp;horsepower (750&nbsp;kW) from its 27-litre displacement: the maximum [[Turbocharger#Boost|boost]] pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6&nbsp;pounds per square inch (0.41&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]).{{#tag:ref|Imperial unit boost pressures refer to figures above or below atmospheric pressure, the Atmosphere unit is used to enable comparison with contempary German engines that used the unit for supercharger pressures.|group=nb}} However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265&nbsp;horsepower (943&nbsp;kW) at 7,870&nbsp;feet (2,400&nbsp;m), 1,285&nbsp;horsepower (958&nbsp;kW) at 9,180&nbsp;feet (2,800&nbsp;m) and 1,320&nbsp;horsepower (984&nbsp;kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150&nbsp;horsepower (857&nbsp;kW) at 15,400&nbsp;feet (4,700&nbsp;m) and 1,160&nbsp;horsepower (865&nbsp;kW) at 16,730&nbsp;feet (5,100&nbsp;m).<ref>Flight 1938, p. 528.</ref>

From late-1939, 100 octane fuel became available from the U.S., West Indies, Persia and domestically.<ref>Payton-Smith 1971, pp. 259<U+2013>260.</ref>  Merlin IIs and IIIs were adapted to run on the new fuel, using an increased boost pressure of +12&nbsp;pounds per square inch (0.82&nbsp;atm). Small modifications were made to the engines which were now capable of generating 1,310&nbsp;horsepower (877&nbsp;kW) at  {{convert|9000|ft|m|abbr=on}}  while running at 3,000&nbsp;revolutions per minute.<ref name="Harvey-Bailey 1995, p. 155."/><ref name ="Encyclopaedia of Aero Engines">Gunston, p. 144.</ref> This increased boost was available for a maximum of five minutes, and if the pilot resorted to emergency boost he had to report this on landing and have it noted in the engine log book. Using +12&nbsp;pounds per square inch (0.82&nbsp;atm) of boost was considered a "definite overload condition on the engine" and the engineering officer was subsequently required to examine the engine and reset the throttle gate.<ref>Air Ministry 1940.</ref> 

In late-1943 trials were run of a new "100/150" grade fuel, recognised by its bright-green colour and "awful smell".<ref>McKinstry 2007, p. 356.</ref> Initial tests were conducted using 6.5&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre]]s of [[tetraethyl lead]] (T.E.L.) for every one gallon of 100 octane fuel; but this mixture resulted in a build-up of lead in the combustion chambers, causing excessive fouling of the [[spark plug]]s. Better results were achieved by adding 2.5% [[Aniline|mono methyl aniline]] (M.M.A.) to 100 octane fuel.<ref>Lovesey 1946, pp. 222<U+2013>223.</ref> The new fuel allowed the boost rating of the Merlin 66 to be raised to +25&nbsp;pounds per square inch (1.7&nbsp;atm).<ref name=Price170>Price 1982. p. 170.</ref> 

Starting in March 1944, the Merlin 66 -powered Spitfire IXs of two squadrons were cleared to use the new fuel for operation trials, and it was put to good use in the summer of 1944 when it enabled Spitfire L.F. Mk. IXs to intercept [[V-1 flying bomb]]s coming in at low altitudes,<ref name=Price170/> as well as by other fighters flown by the [[Air Defence of Great Britain|ADGB]], but continued problems with [[Back-fire|backfires]] were not remedied until August.
In early February 1945, Spitfires of the [[Second Tactical Air Force|2 TAF]] also began using 100/150 grade fuel.<ref name="Berger & Street, 1994. p. 199.">Berger & Street 1994. p. 199.</ref> Monty Berger, Senior Intelligence Officer of 126 (RCAF) Spitfire Wing, 2 TAF, noted that there were still problems being experienced with the new fuel, leading to several fatal accidents. Pilots were relieved when the return to 130 grade was authorised by April 1945.<ref name="Berger & Street, 1994. p. 199."/>

==Production==
Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin was driven by the forethought and determination of [[Ernest Hives, 1st Baron Hives|Ernest Hives]], who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with [[Air Ministry]] and local authority officials. Hives was an advocate of [[Factory#Shadow factories|shadow factories]], and sensing the imminent outbreak of war pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of uninterrupted production several factories were affected by [[industrial action]].<ref>McKinstry 2007, pp. 327<U+2013>329.</ref>

[[File:Osmaston Rolls-Royce.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Image of a red brick building with a central front door, the words Rolls-Royce Limited appear above the door in white letters|Rolls-Royce factory, Nightingale Road, [[Derby]] (photo 2005)]]
The existing Rolls-Royce facilities at [[Osmaston, Derby]] were not suitable for large-scale engine production although the [[Area|floor space]] had been increased by some 25% between 1935 and 1939; nevertheless, Hives planned to build the first two- or three hundred engines there until engineering teething troubles had been resolved. Having a workforce that consisted mainly of design engineers and highly skilled men, the Derby factory carried out the majority of development work on the Merlin, with flight testing carried out at nearby [[Hucknall Airfield|RAF Hucknall]]. The original factory closed in March 2008, but [[Rolls-Royce plc]] still maintains a large presence in Derby.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/7321327.stm Derby factory closure] news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved: 24 August 2009</ref>

===Crewe===
To meet the increasing demand for Merlin engines, Rolls-Royce started building work on a new factory at [[Crewe]] in May 1938, with engines leaving the factory in 1939. The Crewe factory had convenient road and rail links to their existing facilities at Derby. Production at Crewe was originally planned to use unskilled labour and [[Subcontractor|sub-contractors]] with which Hives felt there would be no particular difficulty, but the number of required sub-contracted parts such as crankshafts, camshafts and cylinder liners eventually fell short and the factory was expanded to manufacture these parts "in house".<ref>Pugh 2000, p. 193.</ref>

Initially the local authority promised to build 1,000 new houses to accommodate the workforce by the end of 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a [[Strike action|strike]] took place when women replaced men on [[Turret lathe|capstan lathes]], the workers' [[Trade union|union]] insisting that this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.<ref>Pugh 2000, pp. 196<U+2013>197.</ref> Post-war the factory was used for the production of [[Bentley]] motor cars, and in 1998 [[Volkswagen AG]] bought both the marque and the factory.<ref>[http://www.jackbarclayparts.co.uk/about-us/crewe-history/ Crewe factory history] jackbarclayparts.co.uk. Retrieved: 24 August 2009</ref>

===Glasgow===
[[File:Female workers who works in Rolls Royce Factory.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An image of female workers on an engine assembly line|Female workers on a Merlin production line in 1942]]
Hives further recommended that a factory be built near [[Glasgow]] to take advantage of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers. This [[Her Majesty's Government|government]]-funded and -operated factory was built at [[Hillington, Glasgow|Hillington]] starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, one month after the outbreak of war, the factory becoming fully occupied by September 1940. A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in.<ref>Pugh 2000, p. 197.</ref> 

Having 16,000 employees, the factory was one of the largest industrial operations in Scotland, with engines beginning to leave the line in November 1940. By the start of the [[Battle of Britain]] 2,000 Merlins had been produced at Hillington, the final total being 23,675. Worker [[absenteeism]] became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of [[air-raid shelter]]s. It was agreed to cut the punishing working hours slightly to 82&nbsp;hours a week, with one half-Sunday per month awarded as holiday.<ref>Pugh 2000, p. 198.</ref> Record production is reported to have been 100 engines in one day.<ref name=BBCNews>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/scotland/4531580.stm End of era for Rolls-Royce plant.] news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved: 25 August 2009</ref>

Immediately after the war the site repaired and overhauled Merlin and Griffon engines, and continued to manufacture spare parts.<ref name=BBCNews/> Finally, following the production of the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] and others, the factory was closed in 2005.<ref>[http://www.rolls-royce.com/about/heritage/branches/scotland.jsp Hillington factory history] rolls-royce.com. Retrieved: 24 August 2009 </ref>

===Manchester===
The [[Ford of Britain|Ford Motor Company]] was asked to produce Merlins at [[Trafford Park]], [[Manchester]], and building work on a new factory was started in May 1940 on a 118-acre site. Built with two distinct sections to minimise bomb damage, it was completed in May 1941 and bombed in the same month. At first, the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour, and large numbers of women, youths and untrained men had to be taken on. Despite this, the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month later<ref name=Nicholls103>Nicholls 1996, p. 103.</ref> and it was building the engine at a rate of 200 per week by 1943, at which point the joint factories were producing 18,000 Merlins per year.<ref name= "Lumsden p. 201"/> In his autobiography ''Not much of an Engineer'',  Sir Stanley Hooker states: "...&nbsp;once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production, Merlins came out like shelling peas&nbsp;...".<ref>Hooker 1984, pp. 58<U+2013>59.</ref>

Some 17,316 people worked at the Manchester plant, including 7,260 women and two resident doctors and nurses.<ref name=Nicholls103/> Merlin production started to run down in August 1945, and finally ceased on 23 March 1946.<ref>Nicholls 1996, p. 105.</ref>

===Packard V-1650===
{{Main|Packard V-1650}}

As the Merlin was considered to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. [[Henry Ford]] rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the [[Packard Motor Car Company]] was subsequently selected to take on the [[United States dollar|$]]130,000,000 Merlin order.{{#tag:ref|Value in 1940 U.S. dollars.|group=nb}}<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,795076,00.html ''Time Magazine'' (8 July 1940) <U+2013> Business: Ford's Rolls-Royces.] time.com.

{{Main|List of Rolls-Royce Merlin variants}}
This is a summary list of representative Merlin variants. Engines of the same power output were typically assigned different model numbers based on supercharger or propeller gear ratios, differences in cooling system or carburettors, engine block construction, or arrangement of engine controls.<ref>Bridgman 1998, p. 283.</ref> All but the Merlin 131 and 134 engines were "right-hand tractor", ''i.e.'' the propeller rotated to the right when viewed from the rear.

===Postwar===
At the end of World War II, new versions of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the [[Avro Tudor]], [[military transport aircraft]] such as the [[Avro York]], and the [[Canadair North Star]] which performed in both roles. These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.<ref>Lumsden 2003, pp. 214<U+2013>215.</ref>

A Spanish-built version of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] G-2, the 1954 [[Hispano Aviaci<U+00F3>n HA-1112|Hispano Aviaci<U+00F3>n HA-1112-M1L ''Buchon'']], was built in [[Hispano Aviaci<U+00F3>n|Hispano's]] factory in [[Seville]] with the Rolls-Royce Merlin 500/45 engine of {{convert|1600|hp}} <U+2013> a fitting powerplant for the last-produced version of the famous Messerschmitt fighter, as the Bf 109 V1 prototype aircraft had been powered by the Rolls-Royce Kestrel V-12 engine in 1935.<ref>Lumsden 2003, p. 214.</ref> 

The [[CASA 2.111]] was another Spanish-built version of a German aircraft, the [[Heinkel He 111]], that was adapted to use the Merlin after the supply of [[Junkers Jumo 211]]F-2 engines ran out at the end of the war.<ref>Wilson, Randy.

In the United States many [[Military surplus|war surplus]] engines and airframes were sold relatively cheaply <U+2013> two of the most popular items were [[P-51 Mustang]]s and Packard V-1650 Merlin engines, several of which were "souped up" and modified for air racing in the [[Bendix Trophy]], the Cleveland [[National Air Races|Air Races]]<ref>[http://www.airracinghistory.freeola.com/Cleveland%20Air%20Races.htm Cleveland Air Races] airracinghistory.freeola.com.

===Alternative applications===

A non-supercharged version of the Merlin using a larger proportion of steel and iron components was produced for use in [[tank]]s. This engine, the [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]], in turn led to the smaller [[Rolls-Royce Meteorite]].<ref>Pugh 2000, p. 254.</ref>

In 1938, Rolls-Royce started work on modifying some Merlins which were later to be used in British [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTBs]], [[Motor Gun Boat|MGBs]], and RAF Air-Sea Rescue Launches. For these the superchargers were modified single-stage units and the engine was re-engineered for use in a marine environment.<ref>[http://www.rolls-royce.com/marine/about/marine_history/index.jsp Marine history.] rolls-royce.com.

==Survivors==
One of the most successful of the [[World War II]] era aircraft engines, the Merlin continues to be used in many restored World War II vintage aircraft all over the world. The [[Royal Air Force]] [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]] is a notable current operator of the Merlin. In England the [[Shuttleworth Collection]] owns and operates a Merlin-powered Hawker Sea Hurricane IB and a Supermarine Spitfire VC <U+2013> the Hurricane can be seen flying at home displays throughout the summer months, while the Spitfire is currently undergoing a major restoration project.<ref>[http://www.shuttleworth.org/shuttleworth_aircraft_details.asp?ID=36 Shuttleworth Collection - Hawker Sea Hurricane IB] shuttleworth.org.
