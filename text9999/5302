'''Josip Stritar''' (6 March 1836 <U+2013> 25 November 1923) was a [[Slovene language|Slovene]] [[writer]], [[poet]], [[playwright]], [[publisher]] and [[translator]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.velike-lasce.si/velikolaska-dezela/velikolaski-razumniki/josip-stritar.html |title=Velike La<U+0161><U+010D>e Municipality site |language=Slovene |work=Josip Stritar |publisher=Velike La<U+0161><U+010D>e Municipality |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> 

Stritar spent his early childhood in his home village in rural [[Lower Carniola]] and was sent to school in [[Ljubljana]]. In 1855 he went to study in [[Vienna]] and completed his studies in 1874 after which he became an assistant teacher at [[Hernals]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and after 1878 professor in [[Josefstadt]] where he remained until his retirement in 1901. He returned to Slovenia after he was given a house in [[Roga<U+0161>ka Slatina]] by the regional government in Ljubljana in recognition of his work. He lived there until his death in 1923 and is buried in Ljubljana.<ref>Ga<U+0161>per Troha, [[Sebastijan Pregelj]]: ''Ljubljana Literary Trail'', pgs. 25-26, Beletrina, 2011, ISBN 978-961-242-362-9</ref> One of his important contributions was the introduction to the 1866 edition of [[France Pre<U+0161>eren]]'s collected poems where he pointed out the importance of his poems to nascent Slovene national identity. Despite living most of his life in Vienna he was much admired and appreciated at home even during his lifetime and was made an honorary member of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 1919.<ref>Helga Glu<U+0161>i<U+010D>, ''Sto Slovenskih Pripovednikov'' (Ljubljana: Pre<U+0161>ernova dru<U+017E>ba, 1996) ISBN 961-6186-21-3</ref>
