The '''Angevins''' {{IPAc-en|<U+00E6>|n|d<U+0292>|v|<U+026A>|n|s}}{{mdash}} meaning ''from [[Anjou]]''{{mdash}}are considered by many historians to be the distinct Royal House{{mdash}}and part of the [[House of Plantagenet]]{{mdash}}that provided the English monarchs [[Henry II of England]], [[Richard I of England]] and [[John, King of England|King John]].<ref name=TheAngevins>{{cite web|title= The Angevins | url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAngevins/TheAngevins.aspx | work = The Official Website of The British Monarchy}}</ref> They were a family of [[Franks|Frankish]] origin descended from a ninth-century noble named [[Ingelger]]. The chronicler [[Gerald of Wales]] borrowed elements of the [[Melusine]] legend to give a demonic origin to the Angevins, and several of them were prone to joke about the story.<ref name= Warren>{{harvnb|Warren|1978|p=2}}</ref>

The family held the title [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou]] from 870. Territorial ambitions to expand the Angevin holdings prompted power struggles with neighbouring provinces and led to influence extending into [[County of Maine|Maine]] and [[Touraine]]. [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V, Count of Anjou]] had a number of failed attempts to expand his domains via marrying his daughters to the heirs of Normandy and England before he managed to arrange the marriage between his son and heir, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]], to [[Henry I of England]]'s daughter and only surviving legitimate child, Matilda. This brought about the convergence of the Angevins, the [[House of Normandy]] and the [[House of Wessex]] to form the Plantagenet dynasty. [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk the Younger]] who had forged valuable connections while on the [[Second Crusade]] then resigned his titles to Geoffrey and sailed to become [[King of Jerusalem]] through marriage to [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II's]] daughter [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Melisende]] in 1131.

Geoffrey  who was Fulk's eldest son succeeded upon his father's departure for Jerusalem, whilst [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], Fulk's eldest son with Melisende, inherited Jerusalem after Fulk's death in 1143. It was in 1154 that Geoffrey<U+2019>s son, [[Henry II of England]] won control of England and Normandy  and he later expanded the family's holdings into what was later termed the [[Angevin Empire]] through marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Historians have retrospectively  considered that members of the family from after 1204, when [[John, King of England|John]] lost Anjou and the Angevins' continental territory to the [[House of Capet]] are known as the Plantagenets  until the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. This is from a nickname of Geoffrey. After this the dynasty is considered to split into two [[cadet branch]]es, the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].

== Origins ==
[[Image:The Children of Henry2 England.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=An illuminated diagram showing the Angevins; coloured lines connect the two to show the lineal descent|13th-century depiction of the Angevins{{mdash}}[[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his legitimate children: (l to r) [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] and John]]The Angevins descended from a ninth-century noble named [[Ingelger]] with the family holding the title [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou]] from 870. Main line descent from Ingelger failed in 1060, but [[cognatic]] descent continued from [[Geoffrey II, Count of G<U+00E2>tinais]] and [[Ermengarde of Anjou, Duchess of Burgundy|Ermengarde of Anjou]], the daughter of [[Fulk III of Anjou]]<ref name = Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name="vauchezsixtyfive">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}.</ref> Territorial ambitions to expand the The Angevins struggled successfully for regional power with neighbouring provinces such as [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], extending their influence into [[County of Maine|Maine]] and [[Touraine]]. [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V, Count of Anjou]], married his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Alice]] to the heir of [[Henry I of England]], [[William Adelin]], to address competition from Normandy, but the prince drowned in the wreck of the [[White Ship]].<ref name = Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref> Fulk then wed his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother, [[Robert Curthose]]. Henry had this marriage annulled because of the threat of a rival claim to his throne. Finally, Fulk married his son and heir, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]], to Henry's daughter and only surviving legitimate child, Matilda. This brought about the convergence of the Angevins, the [[House of Normandy]] and the [[House of Wessex]] to form the Plantagenet dynasty. [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk the Younger]] who had forged valuable connections while on the [[Second Crusade]] then resigned his titles to Geoffrey and sailed to become [[King of Jerusalem]] through marriage to [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II's]] daughter [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Melisende]] in 1131.

==Angevin arrival in England==
{{Main|Angevin Empire}}
[[File:France 1154 Eng.jpg|thumb|right|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands named as the "Angevin Empire"]]
[[Empress Matilda|Matilda's]] father {{mdash}}Henry I of England{{mdash}} named her as heir to his large holdings in what are now France and England.<ref name="hooper">{{harvnb|Hooper|1996|p=50}}</ref> But on Henry's death her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] had himself proclaimed king.<ref name=Schama2000p117>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=117}}</ref> Geoffrey showed little interest in England, but he supported Matilda by entering Normandy to claim her inheritance.<ref name="Grant">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> Matilda landed in England to challenge Stephen and was declared "Lady of the English" which resulted in [[the Anarchy|a civil war called the Anarchy]]. When Matilda was forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], Stephen was re-crowned. Matilda was never crowned as the English conflict continued inconclusively. However, Geoffrey secured the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. Matilda's son, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], by his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] had acquired the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] and was now immensely rich. With skilful negotiation with the war-weary Barons of England and King Stephen, he agreed to the [[Treaty of Wallingford]] and was recognised as Stephen's heir.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashley|2003|p=73}}.</ref>

When [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury]] died, Henry appointed his friend, [[Thomas Becket]], to the post in an attempt to re-establish what Henry saw as his rights over the Church in England and reassert the privileges previously held by his father in law. Henry had clashed with the church over whether bishops could excommunicate royal officials without his permission and whether he could try clerics without them appealing to Rome. However, Becket opposed Henry's [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] and fled into exile. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soon soured again when Becket saw the crowning as [[coregent]] of Henry's son by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. On hearing the news Henry uttered the infamous phrase "What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low born clerk". In response to please Henry three of his men murdered Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], probably by misadventure after Becket resisted a botched arrest attempt.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref> In Christian Europe Henry was considered complicit in this crime, making him a pariah, and he was forced to make a dramatic exhibition of penance, publicly walking barefoot into the cathedral and allowing monks to scourge him.<ref name="Schama2000p117" />

In 1155 [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland in order to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref> This was not a matter of urgency until Henry allowed [[Dermot MacMurrough|Dermot of Leinster]] to recruit soldiers in England and Wales for use in Ireland, including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], known as Strongbow. These knights took on the role of colonisers, accruing autonomous power, which concerned Henry. When Dermot died in 1171, his son-in-law, Strongbow, seized significant territory. In response, and also to escape the controversy caused by the murder of Becket, Henry landed and re-established all fiefs, and jurisdictions in Ireland were held subordinate to him as high king.<ref name=Jones2012p79>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=79<U+2013>80}}</ref>

When Henry II attempted to give his land-less youngest son, John, a wedding gift of three castles it prompted his three eldest sons and wife to rebel in the [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174]]. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] encouraged the three elder sons to destabilise his mightiest subject and not to wait for their inheritances. [[William the Lion]] and disgruntled subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt for their own ends. It was only after eighteen months of conflict that Henry II was able to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82<U+2013>92}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182 Henry II gathered his children to plan for [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son, also called Henry, would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]], the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], Brittany and John would receive Ireland. This broke down into further conflict and [[Henry the Young King|the younger Henry]] rebelled again, but died of [[dysentery]]. In 1186 Geoffrey died as a result of a tournament accident but Henry was still reluctant to have a sole heir <ref name=Jones2012p86>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=86}}</ref> so, in 1189, Richard and [[Philip II of France]] were more successful, this time taking advantage of Henry II<U+2019>s failing health. Henry II was forced to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard as sole heir. When Henry II died shortly afterwards his last words to Richard were allegedly "God grant that I may not die until I have my revenge on you".<ref name=Jones2012p109>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=109}}</ref>

==Angevin decline==
{{Main|Richard I of England|John, King of England}}
[[File:Seal - Richard I of England.jpg|thumb|[[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s [[Privy Seal Office|Great Seal]] of 1189]]On the day of Richard's English coronation there was a mass slaughter of the Jews, described by [[Richard of Devizes]] as a "holocaust".<ref name=Ackroyd2000>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|2000|p=54}}</ref> After the coronation Richard quickly put the affairs of the Angevin Empire in order before he joined the Third Crusade to the Middle East in early 1190. Opinions of Richard amongst his contemporaries were mixed. He had rejected and humiliated the king of France's sister; deposed the well-connected king of Cyprus and afterwards sold the island; insulted and refused spoils of the [[third crusade]] to nobles like [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], and was rumoured to have arranged the assassination of [[Conrad of Montferrat]]. His cruelty was demonstrated by his massacre of 2,600 prisoners in Acre.<ref name=Jones2012p128>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=128}}</ref> However, Richard was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners. He achieved victories in the [[Third Crusade]] but failed to capture Jerusalem, retreating from the Holy Land with a small band of followers.<ref name="rich">{{harvnb|Carlton|2003|p=42}}</ref>

Richard was captured  by Leopold on his return journey. Custody was passed to [[Henry the Lion]] and a tax on Richard<U+2019>s subjects of 25% of movables and income was required to pay the ransom of 150,000 marks.<ref name=Jones2012133>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=133}}</ref><ref name=Davies351>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=351}}</ref> Philip II of France had overrun great swathes of Normandy while [[John, King of England|John of England]] controlled much of the remainder of Richard's lands.<ref name=Jones2012139>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=139}}</ref> But, on his return to England, Richard forgave John and re-established his control.<ref name=Jones2012140>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=140-141}}</ref> Leaving England in 1194 never to return, Richard battled Phillip for the next five years for the return of the holdings seized during his incarceration.<ref name=Jones2012145>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=145}}</ref> Close to total victory he was injured by an arrow during the siege of [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Ch<U+00E2>lus-Chabrol]] and died after lingering injured for ten days.<ref name=Jones2012146>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=146}}</ref>

Richard's failure in his duty to provide an heir caused a succession crisis. Anjou, Brittany, Maine and Touraine chose Richard's nephew and nominated heir, [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]], while John succeeded in England and Normandy. Yet again Philip II of France took the opportunity to destabilise the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland, supporting his vassal Arthur's claim to the English crown. Eleanor supported her son John and when Arthur's forces threatened her, John won a significant victory at the [[Battle of Mirebeau]], capturing the entire rebel leadership.<ref name=Turnet1994p100>{{harvnb|Turner|1994|pp=100}}</ref>

Arthur was murdered, it was rumoured by John's own hands, and his sister [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]] would spend the rest of her life in captivity. John's behaviour drove numerous French barons to side with Phillip. The resulting rebellions by the Norman and Angevin barons broke John's control of the continental possessions, leading to the de facto end of the [[Angevin Empire]], even though Henry III would maintain the claim until 1259.<ref name=Jones2012p161>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=161<U+2013>169}}</ref>

After re-establishing his authority in England, John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou. The strategy was to draw the French from Paris while another army, under [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], attacked from the north. However, his allies were defeated at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in one of the most decisive and symbolic battles in French history.<ref name=Favier>{{harvnb|Favier|1993|p=176}}</ref> The battle had both important and high profile consequences.<ref name=Contramine>{{harvnb|Contramine|1992|p=83}}</ref> John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown while King John agreed to a five-year truce. Philip's decisive victory was crucial in ordering politics in both England and France. The battle was instrumental in forming the [[absolute monarchy in France]].<ref name=Smedley1836>{{harvnb|Smedley|1836|p=72}}</ref>

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|One of only four surviving [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the 1215 text of [[Magna Carta]]]]
John's defeats in France weakened his position in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in the treaty called [[Magna Carta]], which limited royal power and established [[common law]]. This would form the basis of every constitutional battle through the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=217}}.</ref> However, both the barons and the crown failed to abide by the terms of Magna Carta, leading to the [[First Barons' War]] in which the rebel barons invited an invasion by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]]. This is considered by some historians to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty with John's death and William Marshall's appointment as the protector of the nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref name=TheAngevins>{{cite web|title=The official website of The British Monarchy|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAngevins/TheAngevins.aspx|work=The Angevins|publisher=The Royal Household <U+00A9> Crown Copyright}}</ref> Marshall won the war with victories at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Dover (1217)|Dover]] in 1217, leading to the [[Treaty of Lambeth]] by which Louis renounced his claims.<ref name=Jones221>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=221<U+2013>222}}.</ref> In victory, the Marshal Protectorate reissued the ''Magna Carta'' agreement as a basis for future government.<ref name=DanzigerGillingham>{{harvnb|DanzigerGillingham|2003|p=271}}.</ref> The term Angevin has also become associated with later [[House of Anjou|Houses of Anjou]] rewarded with the title count by kings of France.

==Legacy==

===House of Plantagenet===
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|One of only four surviving [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the 1215 text of [[Magna Carta]]]]
Prince Louis<U+2019>s invasion is considered by some historians to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] dynasty. The likely outcome of military situation was uncertain at the time of John's death and it was William Marshall who saved the dynasty forcing Louis to renounce his claim through his military victory.<ref name=Jones221>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=221<U+2013>222}}.</ref> However, Philip had captured all of the Angevin possessions in France except [[Gascony]]. This collapse had various causes, including long-term changes in economic power, growing cultural differences between England and Normandy but, in particular, the fragile, familial nature of Henry's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=31}}</ref> Henry III continued his attempts to reclaim Normandy and Anjou until 1259, but John's continental losses and the consequent growth of Capetian power in the 13th century proved to mark a "turning point in European history".<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=270}}</ref>

It was [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]], who adopted Plantagenet as a family name for him and his descendants in the 15th century. ''Plantegenest'' (or ''Plante Genest'') had been a 12th-century nickname of Geoffrey, perhaps because his emblem may have been the [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]], (''planta genista'' in medieval Latin).<ref name=plant2007>{{harvnb|Plant|2007}}</ref> It is uncertain why Richard chose this specific name, but it emphasised Richard's hierarchal status as Geoffrey's (and six English kings') patrilineal descendant during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The retrospective usage of the name for all of Geoffrey's male descendants was popular in Tudor times, perhaps encouraged by the added legitimacy it gave Richard's great grandson, [[Henry VIII of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|2001|p=206}}</ref>

===Descent===

Through John descent from the Angevins is widespread{{mdash}}both legitimate and illigimate{{mdash}} including all subsequent monarchs of England and the United Kingdom. He had five legitimate children by Isabella.

John also had a large number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons <U+2013> [[Richard FitzRoy|Richard]], Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip <U+2013> and three daughters <U+2013> [[Joan, Lady of Wales|Joan]], Maud and probably Isabel.<ref>{{harvnb|Richardson|2004|p=9}}</ref> Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince [[Llywelyn the Great]] of Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=328}}</ref>

===Contemporary Opinion===

[[File:Henry-eleanor-tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Henry and Eleanor in [[Fontevraud Abbey]]]]Henry was not a popular king and few expressed much grief on news of his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Strickland|2007|p=187}}</ref> Writing in the 1190s, William of Newburgh commented that "in his own time he was hated by almost everyone"; he was widely criticised by his own contemporaries, even within his own court.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|p=213}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Vincent|2007b|p=330}}</ref> In contrast his son Richard's contemporaneous image was more mixed. On one hand that of a king who was also a [[knight]], and that was apparently the first such instance of this combination.<ref name="flori484">{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=484<U+2013>485.}}</ref> He was known as a valiant and competent military leader and individual fighter, courageous and generous. Richard, however, also received negative portrayals. During his life, he was criticised by chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the Crusade and for his ransom, whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes.<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=322.}}</ref> 
Chroniclers, including [[Richard of Devizes]], [[William of Newburgh]], [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Ralph de Diceto]] were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard's rule, but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John's reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=2}}</ref> Accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with [[Gervase of Canterbury]] and [[Ralph of Coggeshall]] writing the main accounts; neither of them were positive about John's performance as king.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2000|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=15}}</ref> John's later, negative reputation was largely established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, [[Roger of Wendover]] and [[Matthew Paris]], the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam, a story which is considered to be untrue by modern historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2000|pp=11,14}}</ref>

===Constitutional Impact===
Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule had major long-term consequences. His legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for [[English Common Law]], with the Exchequer court a forerunner of the later [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Bench]] at Westminster.<ref>{{harvnb|Brand|2007|p=216}}</ref> Henry's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of itinerant ''bailli'', for example, clearly drew on the Henrician model.<ref>{{harvnb|HallamEverard|2001|p=211}}</ref> Henry's intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland also had a significant long-term impact on the development of their societies and governmental systems.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1990|pp=22<U+2013>23}}</ref>
John's reign and his signing of ''Magna Carta'' was seen as a positive step in the constitutional development of England and the part of a progressive and [[Universalism|universalist]] course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period by historians in the "[[Whig history|Whiggish]]" tradition.<ref name=DyerP4CossP81>Dyer, p.4; Coss, p.81.</ref> This was despite the flaws of the king himself.<ref name=DyerP4CossP81/> [[Winston Churchill]], for example, argued that "[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns".<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=190}}</ref> Magna Carta was reissued by the Marshal Protectorate and repeatedly afterwards as a basis for future government.<ref name=DanzigerGillingham>{{harvnb|DanzigerGillingham|2003|p=271}}.</ref>

===Historiography===
[[Image:Foxe's Book of Martyrs title page.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A photograph of the wood block print of the Book of Martyrs. The book's title is in the centre and various scenes from the book are depicted around it.|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]'', officially titled ''Acts and Monuments'', which took a positive view of John's reign]]Henry and his reign have attracted historians for many years while Richard's reputation over the years has "fluctuated wildly", according to historian John Gillingham. That reputation has come down through the ages and defines the popular image of Richard.<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=484}}</ref> He left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present, in large part because of his military exploits. This is reflected in [[Steven Runciman]]'s final verdict of Richard I: "he was a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king, but a gallant and splendid soldier." ("History of the Crusades" Vol. III).  
In the 18th century the historian [[David Hume]] argued the Angevins were pivotal to creating a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007a|p=2}}</ref> Interpretations of ''Magna Carta'' and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between "partisan" factions.<ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2005|pp=174}}</ref>
Henry<U+2019>s role in the death of Becket and his disputes with the French were considered relatively praiseworthy and patriotic by [[Protestant]] historians of the period<ref>{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007a|p=3}}</ref> Similarly John's opposition to the Papacy and his promotion of the special rights and prerogatives of a king gained him favour from [[Tudor period|Tudor]] historians in the 16th century. [[John Foxe]], [[William Tyndale]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] portrayed John as an early Protestant hero, and [[John Foxe]] included the king in his ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bevington|2002|p=432}}</ref> [[John Speed]]'s ''Historie of Great Britaine'' in 1632 praised John's "great renown" as a king; he blamed the bias of medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=4}}</ref>

He was no Englishman, but it does not follow that he gave to Normandy, Anjou, or Aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom. His ambition was that of a mere warrior: he would fight for anything whatever, but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for.

The growth of the [[British Empire]] led historians such as [[Kate Norgate]] to undertake detailed research into Henry's continental possessions, creating the term "the Angevin Empire" in the 1880s.<ref>{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007a|p=16}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=15}}</ref> Twentieth-century historians challenged many of these conclusions. In the 1950s Jacques Boussard and John Jolliffe, among others, focused on the nature of Henry's "empire"; French scholars in particular analysed the mechanics of how royal power functioned during this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=19}}</ref> The Anglocentric aspects of many histories of Henry were challenged from the 1980s onwards, with efforts made to bring together British and French historical analysis of the period.<ref>{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007a|p=21}}</ref> More detailed study of the written records left by Henry has cast doubt on some earlier interpretations: Robert Eyton's ground-breaking 1878 work tracing Henry's itinerary through deductions from the [[pipe roll]]s, for example, has been criticised as being too certain a way of determining location or court attendance<ref>{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007a|pp=279<U+2013>281}}</ref> Although many more of Henry's [[royal charter]]s have been identified, the task of interpreting these records, the financial information in the pipe rolls and wider economic data from the reign is understood to be more challenging than once thought.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007a|pp=286,299}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb| Barratt |2007|pp=248<U+2013>294}}</ref> Significant gaps in historical analysis of Henry remain, especially the nature of his rule in Anjou and the south of France.<ref>{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007a|pp=22}}</ref> There has also been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies. Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by [[W. L. Warren|Lewis Warren]], suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed.<ref>Duffy, pp.221, 245.</ref>


Interest in the personal morality of historical figures and scholars grew in the Victorian period led to greater criticism of Henry's personal behaviour and Becket<U+2019>s death.<ref>{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007a|pp=5<U+2013>7}}</ref> Historians were also more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John's moral personality. [[Kate Norgate]], for example, argued that John's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his "almost superhuman wickedness", whilst James Ramsay blamed John's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall.<ref>{{harvnb|Norgate|1902|p=286}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ramsay|1903|p=502}}</ref>

Richard's sexuality has become an issue of wider interest and controversy since the 1940s when John Harvey challenged what he perceived as "the conspiracy of silence" surrounding Richard's [[homosexuality]] drawing on chronicler accounts of Richard's behaviour, two public confessions, penitences and Richard's childless marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=119<U+2013>139.}}</ref> Opinion remains divided on this question. For example Gillingham argues against the idea<ref name="Gillingham 1994 119<U+2013>139.">{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=119<U+2013>139.}}</ref> and Jean Flori takes the contrary position.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=119<U+2013>139}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=448}}</ref>
Today historians {{mdash}} such as  John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren{{mdash}} argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but also that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers. .<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|2007|pp=353}}</ref>  [[Jim Bradbury]] notes the contemporary consensus that John was a "hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general", albeit, as Turner suggests, with "distasteful, even dangerous personality traits".<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|2009|pp=23}}</ref> [[John Gillingham]], author of a major biography of Richard I concurs but considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren; Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|2007|pp=361}}</ref> Popular historian [[Frank McLynn]] maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, arguing that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is "bizarre", and that as a monarch John "fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set".<ref>{{harvnb|McLynn|2007|pp=472<U+2013>473}}</ref>

 [[Image:BritLibRoyal14CVIIFol006rMattParisSelfPort.jpg|thumb|alt=A medieval sketch of Matthew Paris, dressed as a monk and on his hands and knees.|Matthew Paris, one of the first historians of John's reign]]Henry II appears in highly fictionalised form as a character in several modern plays and films. The King forms a central character in [[James Goldman]]'s 1966 play ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'', set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. He is presented as masculine in contrast to John represented as an "effete weakling".<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2011|pp=109<U+2013>110}}</ref>  In the 1968 film Henry is represented as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king.<ref>Martinson, p.263; Palmer, p.46.</ref>  Henry also appears in the play ''[[Becket]]'' by [[Jean Anouilh]], [[Becket (1964 film)|filmed]] in 1964. .<ref>{{harvnb|Anouilh|2005|p=xxiv}}</ref><ref>Anouilh, p.xxiv.</ref> The Becket conflict also forms the basis for [[T. S. Eliot]]'s play ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]''  forming a discussion of the of Becket's death and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode. .<ref>{{harvnb|TiwawiTiwawi|2007|p=90}}</ref>

 [[Image:FirstFolioKingJohn.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the first page of Shakespeare's play "King John", with two columns of text below.|Shakespeare's play ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'']]It was in the Tudor period that popular representations of John first emerged. .<ref>{{harvnb|Bevington|2002|pp=432}}</ref> He appeared as a "proto-Protestant martyr" in the anonymous play ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]''  and [[John Bale]]'s morality play ''[[John Bale#Kynge Johan|Kynge Johan]]'' {{mdash}} in which John attempts to save England from the "evil agents of the Roman Church".<ref name="Curren-Aquino 1989 19">{{harvnb|Curren-Aquino|1989|pp=19}}</ref>  Shakespeare's relatively anti-Catholic play {{mdash}}''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]''{{mdash}} draws on ''The Troublesome Reign''  but offers a more "balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler".<ref>{{harvnb| Curren-Aquino |1989 |p=19}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bevington|2002|pp=454}}</ref> [[Anthony Munday]]'s play ''[[The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington]]'' portrays many of John's negative traits, but adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church. <ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=70}}</ref> By the middle of the 17th century, plays such as [[Robert Davenport]]'s ''[[King John and Matilda]]'', although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour. <ref>{{harvnb|Maley|2010|p=50}}</ref>  Graham Tulloch noted that totally unfavourable nineteenth-century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s historical romance  ''[[Ivanhoe]]''. This in turn influenced the late 19th-century children's writer [[Howard Pyle]]'s book ''[[The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood]]''  which established John as the principal villain within the traditional [[Robin Hood]] narrative. During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. [[Sam De Grasse]]'s role as John in the black-and-white [[Robin Hood (1922 film)|1922 film version]] shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture. .<ref>{{harvnb|Aberth|2003|p=166}}</ref> [[Claude Rains]] played John in the [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|1938 colour version]] alongside [[Errol Flynn]], starting a trend for films to depict John as an "effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home"...<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|pp=210}}</ref> The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], who is usually the "swashbuckling villain" opposing Robin. An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Disney cartoon version]], for example, which depicts John, voiced by [[Peter Ustinov]], as a "cowardly, thumbsucking lion".<ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=218}}</ref>

===Medieval folklore===
{{main|Matter of England}}
From the 13th century folk tales developed in which Richard<U+2019>s minstrel [[Blondel de Nesle|Blondel]] travelled singing a song known only to the two of them to find where Richard was imprisoned.<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=191<U+2013>192.}}</ref> The story was the basis of [[Andr<U+00E9> Ernest Modeste Gr<U+00E9>try]]'s opera ''Richard Coeur-de-Lion'' and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to [[Richard Thorpe]]'s film version of ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]''.  In the 16th century, tales of [[Robin Hood]] started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry, during the misrule of Richard's evil brother John, while Richard was away at the Third Crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Holt|1982|p=170}}</ref>
