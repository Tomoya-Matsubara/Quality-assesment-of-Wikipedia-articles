'''Jakob''' "'''Jaap'''" '''Stam''' (born 17 July 1972 in [[Kampen (Overijssel)|Kampen]]) is a retired Dutch [[Association football|football]] player who was twice voted best defender in the [[1998<U+2013>99 UEFA Champions League|1998<U+2013>99]] and [[1999<U+2013>2000 UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/SuperCup/news/Kind=1/newsId=447990.html |title=UEFA Super Cup |publisher=UEFA.com |date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2008 }}</ref> He played for several European clubs including [[PSV Eindhoven]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[S.S. Lazio]], [[A.C. Milan]] and [[AFC Ajax]] before retiring in October 2007.  He was known for possessing "a rare combination of speed, strength and ball-playing ability".<ref>{{cite web|title=Player Profile|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/holland/squad/742254.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>  Stam is currently the assistant manager of Art Langeler at his former club [[FC Zwolle]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Stam started his career with local amateur football club [[DOS Kampen]]. On 15 August 1992, Stam made his professional debut for [[FC Zwolle]] in a 1<U+2013>1 draw against [[Heracles Almelo|SC Heracles]] in the [[Eerste Divisie]]. He became a first team regular right away and moved to [[Eredivisie]] side [[SC Cambuur|Cambuur Leeuwarden]] for the following season, but relegated in his first season which brought him back into the Eerste Divisie. Two seasons at Cambuur earned him a transfer to Eredivisie side [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]]. At Willem II he impressed at the Eredivisie level straight away, which meant his final breakthrough.  A shock 1<U+2013>0 home victory over [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] led to Stam's transfer to [[PSV Eindhoven]] in the same season in which they eventually won the [[KNVB Cup]], his first professional trophy.

===PSV===
Stam was a key player for PSV in the 1996<U+2013>97 season, as the team won the Eredivisie Championship and the [[Johan Cruijff Shield|Johan Cruijff-schaal]]; Stam won the VVCS Footballer of the Year award. 

In 1998, Stam became the then [[World football transfer record|most expensive]] Dutch football player in history and the most expensive defender in history, when [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] bought him for [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]10.6&nbsp;million.

===Manchester United===
Stam spent three seasons at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], during which time United won three [[Premier League]] titles, one [[FA Cup]], the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He scored his only goal for the club in a 6-2 away victory against [[Leicester City]].<ref>{{cite news

Early in the [[2001<U+2013>02 in English football|2001<U+2013>02]] season, Stam was controversially sold to [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in [[Italy]], after Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was reportedly furious with allegations Stam had made in his autobiography ''Head to Head'' about himself and the club. Stam made numerous statements in the book about his views on opposing players, and notoriously alleged that Ferguson's approach to buy him was done without the permission of [[PSV Eindhoven]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,543938,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Interview: Jaap Stam | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> [[Laurent Blanc]] was signed as his replacement.

However, Alex Ferguson has since described the decision to sell Stam: "At the time he had just come back from an achilles injury and we thought he had just lost a little bit. We got the offer from Lazio, <U+00A3>16.5m for a centre-back who was 29. It was an offer I couldn't refuse. But in playing terms it was a mistake. He is still playing for Ajax at a really good level."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ferguson-will-never-talk-to-the-bbc-again-401487.html|title=Ferguson will never talk to the BBC again|date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2011-11-29| Alex Ferguson describing the sale of Jaap Stam http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ferguson-will-never-talk-to-the-bbc-again-401487.html|publisher=The Independent|location=London|first=Nick|last=Harris}}</ref> On the financial report Manchester United announced the fee was <U+00A3>15.3 million.<ref>http://production.investis.com/manutd/findata/reports/anrep01/chstat.pdf</ref>

===Lazio===
During his time with [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], Stam was found guilty of having the banned steroid [[nandrolone]] in his system following a [[Serie A]] game,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1660605.stm|title=Stam suspension upheld|date=2001-11-17|accessdate=2009-10-09|publisher=BBC}}</ref> and received a five-month ban, which was eventually reduced by a month after appeals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/1853735.stm|title=Stam cleared to return|date=2002-03-04|accessdate=2009-10-09|publisher=BBC}}</ref> He is the second Lazio player suspended in 2001, after [[Fernando Couto]].

In his last season at the club, he won the [[Coppa d'Italia]] with Lazio.

===Milan===
Stam joined [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] after [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]].  He reached his second Champions League final with the ''Rossoneri'' in 2005, but was a runner-up after his team was defeated by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in a penalty shootout.<ref>{{cite news| title = AC Milan 3<U+2013>3 Liverpool (aet)|publisher=BBC Sport | date=25 May 2005| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4573159.stm| accessdate=15 April 2007 }}</ref>

===Ajax===
On 30 January 2006, it was announced that he would return to the Eredivisie and play for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], where he signed a two-year contract for <U+20AC>2.5 million transfer fee. Stam was named team captain upon his arrival at the club. In his first season, he won both the [[Johan Cruijff Shield|Johan Cruijff-schaal]] and the [[KNVB Cup]], and another Johan Cruijff-schaal was added to his trophies at the start of the 2007<U+2013>08 season.

On 29 October 2007, he announced his retirement from professional football with immediate effect after playing six league games for Ajax in [[Eredivisie 2007-08]].

==Post career==
In October 2008 Stam returned to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a scout for the club, responsible for most of [[South America]].<ref name="sky_scout">{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_4339033,00.html |title=Douglas advised to ignore European interest |work=Sky Sports |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1076167/Jaap-Stam-makes-Sir-Alex-signs-United-South-American-talent-scout.html |title=Jaap Stam makes up with Sir Alex and signs up for United as a South American talent scout |work=Daily Mail |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=13 October 2008 | location=London | first=Ashley | last=Gray}}</ref>  

==Soccer Aid==
Stam has been involved with [[Soccer Aid]], which puts celebrities and football legends together in two teams; England and Rest of the World for a charity game in aid of [[Unicef]]. Stam first appeared in Series 2 of Soccer Aid in 2008, where he played ninety minutes in his favoured centre-back position. Stam was on the losing side as Rest of the World fell to a 4-3 defeat to England at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Most notable players to be included in the Rest of the World 2008 squad include [[Paolo Di Canio]] and [[Luis Figo]].

Stam also appeared in Soccer Aid for Series 4, playing for Rest of the World who lost 3-1. Former [[Blackburn Rovers]] star [[Robbie Savage]] picked Stam as one of the best players in the match.

==International career==
Stam made his debut for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] on 24 April 1996, in the 1<U+2013>0 defeat to [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. He was also an important player in the Dutch team that finished fourth in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]

During the [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], he reached another semi finals with the Dutch team, hosted in his home country and [[Belgium]]. Stam missed an important penalty kick in the [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] in the semi-finals, which led to defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

Stam reached his third semi finals in an international competition with his nation during [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] in [[Portugal]] and retired from international football after the tournament. The reason cited for his international retirement was that he wanted to focus on his new team [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and his family.

In total he played 67 matches for the Netherlands, scoring 3 goals.
