'''Heinz Field''' is an [[American football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It is the home to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]]; members of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), respectively. The stadium opened in 2001, shortly after the [[building implosion|controlled implosion]] of the teams' previous stadium, [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. The stadium is named for locally based [[H. J. Heinz Company]], which bought the [[naming rights]] in 2001.

Funded in conjunction with [[PNC Park]], the [[United States dollar|US$]]281 million stadium stands along the [[Allegheny River]], on the [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|Northside]] of Pittsburgh. The stadium was designed with the city of Pittsburgh's history of steel production in mind, which lead to the inclusion of 12,000&nbsp;[[ton]]s of steel into the design.<ref name=FactSh/> Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999 and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium's natural grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers ownership has kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. Attendance for the 65,050&nbsp;seat stadium has sold out for every Steelers home game, a streak which dates back to 1972. A collection of memorabilia from the Steelers and Panthers of the past can be found in the [[Coca-Cola]] Great Hall.

===Planning and funding ===
The Pittsburgh Steelers and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] shared [[Three Rivers Stadium]] from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pittsburgh Pirates building a full-time [[baseball park]], a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility.<ref name=Bflawed/> Though met with negative reaction from Steelers ownership, the proposal was used as a "fallback position" that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed.<ref>{{cite news |first= Tom|last= Barnes|title= Steelers sell bonds to help raise money for new stadium|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19980618bplanb5.asp|publisher= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date= 1998-06-18|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> Steelers ownership stated that failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances of signing players who might opt to sign with other teams, such as the other five teams in the Steelers division who had all recently built new football-only stadiums.<ref>{{cite news |first= Ed|last= Bouchette|title= Heinz Field: Standing up to the competition |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/steelers/20010824hsteele0824p2.asp|publisher= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date= 2001-08-24|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> In June 2001, the [[H.
