'''Apollo Smile''' (born Paula Apollo Anne Scharf on [[February 16]], [[1967]] in [[New York City]]) is a [[pop music]] [[songwriter]], [[singer]] and [[voice actress]]. Among her earliest efforts was a track on the [[Tom Cruise]] film ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' and a self-titled [[1991]] album.  Later on, she billed herself as ''"The [[Live Action]] [[Anime]] Girl"'' and was invited to several [[science fiction]] [[Fan convention|conventions]] as a guest.  Her convention appearances usually showcased music concerts featuring her original upbeat music and demonstrations of her [[martial arts]] abilities.  Her typical look during this time was skin-tight [[spandex]] clothing, with her blonde hair in pigtails tied off with pink bows.

Smile hosted [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel's]] Anime Week in the summer of 1998.  Other notable projects included a self-published comic book featuring herself as the central character and the voice of [[Ulala]] in the [[Space Channel 5|''Space Channel 5'']] [[video game]] series.

In more recent years, Apollo Smile has seemingly moved away from the "anime girl" role she created for herself, seeking small but more conventional film and television roles.  She also toured for a short while with the [[Virginia]] ''"[[Atari]]"'' band [[Rockbot]].
