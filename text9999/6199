In [[coordination chemistry]], the '''coordination sphere''' refers to a central atom or ion and an array of molecules or anions, the [[ligand]]s, around.

Molecules that are attached noncovalently to the ligands are called the '''second coordination sphere'''.

==Second coordination sphere==
The second coordination sphere refers to the molecules that are attached non[[covalent]]ly to ligands that occupy the first coordination sphere.  These molecules are typically solvent.  The interations between the first and second coordination spheres usually involve hydrogen-bonding.  For positively charged complexes, [[ion-pair]]ing is important.  Solvent effects are pronounced in complexes where the ligands in the first coordination ligands are strong hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, e.g. respectively [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> and [[Ferricyanide|[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>]].  Crown-ethers bind to polyamine complexes through their second coordination sphere.<ref>Lehn, J. M. Supramolecular Chemistry: Concepts and Perspectives; VCH: Weinhiem, 1995.</ref>

== Example ==
[[File:CoA6Cl3.png|thumb|right|250px|Hexamminecobalt(III) chloride<br />([Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub>)]]

In [[hexamminecobalt(III) chloride]] ([Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub>), the cobalt cation plus the six ammonia ligands comprise the first coordination sphere. The coordination sphere of this ion thus consists of a central MN<sub>6</sub> core "decorated" by 24 N-H bonds that radiate outwards.{{clear}}

==In biological and computational chemistry==
Mechanisms of [[metalloprotein]]s often invoke modulation of the second coordination sphere by the protein.  In solution, metal ions can be described as consisting of series of two concentric coordination spheres, the first and second.  More distant from the second coordination sphere, the solvent molecules behave more like "bulk solvent."  Simulation of this [[solvation]] is of interest in [[computational chemistry]].

==Role in mechanistic inorganic chemistry==
The rates at which ligands exchange between the first and the second coordination sphere is the first step in ligand substitution reactions. In [[Associative substitution|associative ligand substitution]], the entering nucleophile enters via the second coordination sphere.  These rates vary over many orders of magnitude.  The energetics of many [[inner sphere electron transfer]] reactions are discussed in terms of second coordination sphere.  Some [[proton coupled electron transfer]] reactions involve atom transfer between the second coordination spheres of the reactants:
:[Fe*(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>  +  [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(OH)]<sup>2+</sup>  <U+2192>   [Fe(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>  +  [Fe*(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(OH)]<sup>2+</sup>
