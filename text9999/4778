==Service to the church==
Waller taught [[Sunday school]] while in his early teens.<ref name = "discovering"/> In 1837 the [[Presbytery of New Castle]] granted Waller [[licensure]].<ref name = "family papers"/> In 1838 the Presbyterian Church in [[Milton, Pennsylvania]] requested Waller's service, but Waller instead opted to preach in [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania]].<ref name = "discovering"/> However, before doing so, he preached in Wilkes-Barre and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in late 1838 and in Danville and Milton in early 1839.<ref name = "preacher, entrepreneur"/> On May 1, 1839 he was [[ordain]]ed in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania.<ref name = "family papers"/> His Presbyterian ministry began on a wooden church on Third Street in Bloomsburg.<ref name = "discovering"/> When Waller first began preaching, his [[Christian ministry|ministry]] covered all of [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia County]], stretching from [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]] to the Wyoming Valley.<ref name = "discovering"/> In 1840 Waller ceased preaching at [[Briar Creek, Pennsylvania|Briar Creek]] and [[Berwick, Pennsylvania|Berwick]].

==Land purchase and sale==
Waller owned 20 percent (900 acres) of the land in Bloomsburg at some time, which is more than any other person has held in the town to date as well as some land in other parts of Columbia County and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. Waller's lands in Bloomsburg primarily included northeastern, southeastern, and south-central Bloomsburg, but also included some small areas of land near Bloomsburg's border with [[Hemlock Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Hemlock Township]]. He sold some of his land, but also donated parts of it by selling those areas for $1.<ref name = "preacher, entrepreneur"/>

Waller developed a number of community features on this land, including five churches, the Columbia County Courthouse and Jail, and several industries such as the Magee Carpet Company and the Bloomsburg Silk Mills. In 1870 Waller sold three acres of land on Seventh Street in Bloomsburg for the purpose of building a [[park]], but the land was instead used for athletic competitions. In 1890 he sold two lots at the corner of Sixth Street and Iron Street to [[Paul E. Wirt]], a [[fountain pen]] manufacturer. Waller also hired the town engineer [[Samuel Neyhard]] to [[housing development|develop]] Bloomsburg from Fifth Street to the Susquehanna River.

In 1869 Waller purchased 330 acres of land along [[Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)|Fishing Creek]] from the [[Bloomsburg Iron Company]] and for $3000 and later sold it for $19,037.

In 1854 Waller and two other people were chosen to find a location for Bloomsburg's Rosemont Cemetery. They chose a hill immediately north of Bloomsburg. This was partly Waller's land, so on August 1, 1855 he sold them 2 acres and 33.5 [[perch (unit)|perches]] of land to the Rosemont Cemetery Company for $490. Waller was president of the company from 1856 to his death in 1893.<ref name = "discovering"/>

Waller put most of his money into the building of the North and West Branch Railway. The work on the railroad stopped during the [[Panic of 1873]] but resumed in 1880. The North and West Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 but Waller managed to regain much of the company. The company was leased to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] on November 23, 1881 but remained its own company for approximately 20 years.<ref name = "preacher, entrepreneur"/> He was president of the North and West Branch Railway in the 1880s.

Waller was involved in the process of mining [[anthracite]] and owned large tracts of coal-containing land. In 1837 he invested jointly in an area of coal-containing land in [[Plymouth Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Township]] (now [[Larksville, Pennsylvania|Larksville]]) with his uncle, [[Oristus Collins]]. Waller and Collins divided the land into their own parcels in 1840. He and several of his siblings also bought a piece of coal-mining land from his father for $10,000 in 1857. Waller gradually bought the coal-containing lots of his siblings until he had close to 250 acres of land with coal in 1872. In 1878 Waller purchased 28 acres of coal-mining land in Plymouth Township from [[Joseph Jaquish]]'s heirs. Altogether Waller's coal-mining lands outputted 50,000 [[ton]]s (45,454 [[tonne]]s) per year, although this was only a small portion of the total coal output of the Wyoming Valley. After retiring as a minister Waller also purchased 2000 acres of coal-mining land near [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name = "preacher, entrepreneur"/>
