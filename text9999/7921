==Background==
Dagmar Nordstrom was born in [[Chicago]], the second daughter of Anna and Alexander Nordstrom. The family were of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] extraction. Dagmar was married briefly to a society playboy, but lived most of her life with her older sister after the death of Siggie's husband, Samuel Ferebee Williams, in 1931.<ref>"Samuel F. Williams, Originator of 'Tootsie Rolls,' Dies In His 48th Year", ''The New York Times'', October 17, 1931, page 12.</ref>

==Career==
During the 1920s she cut [[piano roll]]s for [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] and  [[Piano roll|Duo-Art]]. These included: 
* ''"I Still Love You"'' (by [[Milton Ager]])
* ''"If You Don't Love Me"'' (by [[Jack Yellen|Yellen]]-[[Milton Ager|Ager]])
* ''"[[Happy Days and Lonely Nights]]"''
* ''"Sweet Dreams"'' (Ager)
* ''"Are You Happy?"'' (Ager)
* ''"Blue River"''
* ''"[[Glad Rag Doll]]"'' (by [[Jack Yellen|Yellen]]-[[Milton Ager|Ager]]-[[Dan Dougherty|Dougherty]])
* ''"That's the Good Old Sunny South"''

Dagmar and Siggie had a [[apartment|flat]] in [[London]] for a year in 1939 when they were the resident performers at [[The Ritz London Hotel|The Ritz]]. With the exception of their October trips to [[Bad Gastein]] for the baths, they regularly performed either in clubs in [[New York City]] or on board [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] [[ocean liners]], most commonly on the [[Cunard Line]] and [[Norwegian America Line]].  The duo were on the maiden around the world voyage of the combined ocean liner/cruise ship ''[[Saga Rose|MS Sagafjord]]''.

Dagmar wrote the music for ''Remembering You'', a [[foxtrot]] which was published as sheet music and a full orchestration in 1940. During the 1940s she and her sister were often on the radio and through the 1960s when they were not otherwise engaged as a team, Dagmar would at times take an assignment alone playing in a club.<ref>"News of Night Clubs; Great expectations"

Several good friends, including the photographer [[Edgar de Evia]], arrived for dinner and she was reclined in their living room, her mind still clear, saying ''"Oh, my dear boys, I believe that I've had a stroke."'' She died that night, aged 72. Following services at the [[Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home]],<ref>"Beloved sister of S Nordstrom Williams" [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0917FE3E5F167493C2A8178FD85F428785F9&scp=29&sq=Nordstrom%20Sisters&st=cse] ''[[New York Times]]'', April 10, 1976; retrieved February 21, 2009</ref> she was [[cremated]] and [[interred]] with her mother in the [[mausoleum]] at [[Ferncliff Cemetery]], [[Westchester County, New York]].
