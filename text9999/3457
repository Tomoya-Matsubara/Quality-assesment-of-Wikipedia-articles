Similar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer through the region of [[Unova]], as they train Pok<U+00E9>mon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. ''Black'' and ''White'' introduced 156 new Pok<U+00E9>mon to the franchise, 5 more than the previous record holder [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Red'' and ''Blue'']], as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pok<U+00E9>mon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pok<U+00E9>mon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]].

Upon their release, ''Black'' and ''White'' received positive reviews; critics praised the advancements in gameplay, as well as several of the new Pok<U+00E9>mon introduced. Reviewers, however, were divided on some of the character designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, ''Black'' and ''White'' sold one million consumer pre-orders and sold five million copies as of January 2011, making it one of the best selling DS games to date. As of March 2013, the games' combined sales have reached 15.42 million, putting the titles amongst [[List of best-selling Nintendo DS video games|the best selling games for the Nintendo DS]], but still being outsold by their predecessors, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']].<ref name="mar13">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/software/ds.html|title=Top Selling Software Sales Units - Nintendo DS Software|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2013-03-31|accessdate=2013-04-24}}</ref> 
Sequels to ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' and ''White'', named [[#Pok<U+00E9>mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], were released in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]] in June 2012, with October releases in North America, Europe, and Australia.

==Gameplay==
{{main|Gameplay of Pok<U+00E9>mon}}
''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' and ''White'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements, presented in a [[Grammatical person#Use of grammatical person in creative media|third-person]], [[overhead perspective]].<ref name="IGN Review"/> There are three basic screens: an [[overworld]], in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player controls a Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer who begins the game with a single Pok<U+00E9>mon<ref name="m7">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, p. 7.</ref> and is able to capture more using [[Pok<U+00E9> Ball]]s.<ref name="m19">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, p. 19.</ref> Like all other Trainers, the player can carry up to six Pok<U+00E9>mon at one time. However, the game also includes a network of PCs to store hundreds of Pok<U+00E9>mon. PCs are found in certain buildings<U+2014>namely, "Pok<U+00E9>mon Centers", where the player heals their Pok<U+00E9>mon with low health.<ref name="m21">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, p. 21.</ref>

Most Pok<U+00E9>mon evolve into other forms when certain conditions are met, such as when they reach a certain [[levels up|level]]<U+2014>levels range from 1 to 100<U+2014>or have a certain [[item (gaming)|item]] used on them.<ref name="m20"/> They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent.<ref name="m18">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, p. 18.</ref> They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum [[health (gaming)|HP]] (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, such as Normal, Water, Electric, Ghost, Bug, and Rock; Pok<U+00E9>mon can have one or two types. Generally, most of a Pok<U+00E9>mon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pok<U+00E9>mon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pok<U+00E9>mon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/snivy|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6TNYpaXzn|archivedate=2014-10-16|deadurl=no|publisher=Pokemon.com|accessdate=2014-10-16|title=Snivy / Pok<U+00E9>dex}}</ref>

When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pok<U+00E9>mon]] or is challenged by another Trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen where the Pok<U+00E9>mon fight. During battle, the player may [[Types of Pok<U+00E9>mon moves|fight]], use an item, switch the active Pok<U+00E9>mon, or flee. However, the player cannot flee a battle against another Trainer or against certain wild Pok<U+00E9>mon that are stronger than the player's. When a Pok<U+00E9>mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints until it is revived.<ref name="m17 18">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref> If an opposing Pok<U+00E9>mon faints, all of the player's Pok<U+00E9>mon who participated in defeating it receive [[experience point]]s. After accumulating enough experience points, a Pok<U+00E9>mon may level up, increasing its stats.<ref name="m20">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, p. 20.</ref> Many Pok<U+00E9>mon evolve into other forms, usually by reaching certain levels.<ref name="m20"/> At the "Day Care" location, the player can breed two of their Pok<U+00E9>mon<U+2014>usually, a male and a female<U+2014>to create Eggs that hatch into baby Pok<U+00E9>mon at level 1.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06|quote='''Day Care Lady:''' I'm the Day Care Lady. We can raise Pok<U+00E9>mon for you. What do you want to do today?}}</ref>

The world of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' and ''White'', known as Unova, consists of a number of cities and towns connected by "Routes".<ref name="IGN Review"/> Random encounters may take place in tall grass along routes or in bodies of water. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities and towns, as well as along routes.<ref name="game">{{cite video game|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06}}</ref> In addition, eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to "Gym Leaders", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok<U+00E9>mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a "Badge". All eight Badges are needed to unlock the Pok<U+00E9>mon League,<ref name="m10">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, p. 10.</ref> where the player faces off against the "Elite Four" and, finally, the Champion. Across Unova, items can be found on the ground or purchased from "Pok<U+00E9> Marts".<ref name="game"/> For example, Hyper Potions restore HP,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Black|developer=Game Freak|publisher=Nintendo|date=2011-03-06|quote='''Description:''' Hyper Potion / A spray-type medicine for wounds.

The "Surf" HM move, as one example, is used to cross bodies of water.<ref name="m23">''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' instruction manual, p. 23.</ref>

===New features===
The graphics have been improved from [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]. The dialog boxes of previous games have been changed to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have [[kanji]] appear on screen, rather than only [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system01-01.html|title=<U+6F22><U+5B57><U+30E2><U+30FC><U+30C9> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> During battles, the sprites of the Pok<U+00E9>mon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle.<ref name="IGN Review"/> In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']], ''Black'' and ''White'' introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as [[Autumn leaf color|changing of leaves in autumn]] or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pok<U+00E9>mon can be found in the wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/story/story01.html|title=<U+30A4><U+30C3><U+30B7><U+30E5><U+5730><U+65B9> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> The Pok<U+00E9>mon [[Deerling]] and [[Sawsbuck]] change their physical appearance to match the seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/pokemon/new/pk015.html|title=<U+30B7><U+30AD><U+30B8><U+30AB> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonblackwhite.com/en-us/unova-region/seasons/ |title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Black Version and Pok<U+00E9>mon White Version {{!}} Four Seasons of Pok<U+00E9>mon! |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref>

There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02.html|title=<U+30D0><U+30C8><U+30EB> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and Rotation Battles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-02.html|title=<U+30ED><U+30FC><U+30C6><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3><U+30D0><U+30C8><U+30EB> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> In Triple Battles, both teams must send out three Pok<U+00E9>mon in a row at once; Pok<U+00E9>mon on the left or right side can only attack the opponent's Pok<U+00E9>mon on the same side or in the center. Changing position takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pok<U+00E9>mon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. ''Black'' has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in ''White''. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pok<U+00E9>mon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pok<U+00E9>mon rather than only Single Battles as usual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-01.html|title=<U+91CE><U+751F><U+306E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+304C><U+540C><U+6642><U+306B>2<U+5339><U+51FA><U+73FE><U+FF01> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|language=Japanese|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>

Occasionally, the player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pok<U+00E9>mon, a Pok<U+00E9>mon more common in the opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pok<U+00E9>mon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This is the only way to capture Pok<U+00E9>mon such as [[Audino]], [[Emolga]], and [[Alomomola]]. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pok<U+00E9>mon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter [[Drilbur]], [[Excadrill]], [[Ducklett]], or [[Swanna]], none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Pok<U+00E9> Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event.<ref name="game"/> There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in [[Gameplay of Pok<U+00E9>mon#Pok<U+00E9>mon Musicals|Pok<U+00E9>mon Musicals]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|title=<U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30DF><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+30B8><U+30AB><U+30EB> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> a side-game similar to the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Contest]]s of previous games; the [[Battle Subway]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-04.html|title=<U+30D0><U+30C8><U+30EB><U+30B5><U+30D6><U+30A6><U+30A7><U+30A4> {{!}} <U+300E><U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30FB><U+30DB><U+30EF><U+30A4><U+30C8><U+300F><U+516C><U+5F0F><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30C8>|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> similar to the [[Battle Tower]]s and [[Battle Frontier]]s of previous games; and on the ''Royal Unova'',{{efn|In the original Japanese release, this is named the {{nihongo4|''Royal Isshu''|<U+30ED><U+30A4><U+30E4><U+30EB><U+30A4><U+30C3><U+30B7><U+30E5><U+53F7>|Roiyaru Isshu-g<U+014D>}}.}} a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/23718/news/pokmon-black-white-gameplay-video-shows-castelia-city/|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Black & White gameplay video shows Castelia City|last=East|first=Thomas|publisher=''Official Nintendo Magazine''|date=2011-02-21|accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref>

===Story===
Like previous ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games, ''Black'' and ''White'' both follow a [[linear gameplay|linear]] storyline; the main events occur in a fixed order. The [[protagonist]] of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' and ''White'' is a teenager who sets out on a journey through Unova to become the Pok<U+00E9>mon master. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either [[Snivy]], [[Tepig]], or [[Oshawott]] as their [[starter Pok<U+00E9>mon]] as a gift from [[Professor Juniper]]. The protagonist's friends, Cheren and Bianca, are also rival [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer]]s who occasionally battle the player, Cheren will chose the Pok<U+00E9>mon with a type advantage against yours, while Bianca will chose the Pok<U+00E9>mon with a type disadvantage. The player's primary goal is to obtain the eight [[Gym Leader|Gym Badges]] of Unova and ultimately challenge the [[Elite Four]] of the Pok<U+00E9>mon League, and its Champion, to win the game.
[[File:Brooklyn Bridge Postdlf.jpg|thumb|The [[Brooklyn Bridge]] was used as an inspiration for the Skyarrow Bridge in Unova.]]
In addition to the standard gameplay, the player will also have to defeat the games' main antagonist force, [[Team Plasma]], a [[Knights Templar]]-esque group who claims that Pok<U+00E9>mon are oppressed by mankind and seeks for a means to liberate them.<ref name="What You Need To Know About Pokemon Black/White">{{cite web|title=What You Need To Know About Pokemon Black/White|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/what-you-need-to-know-about-pokemon-black-white|publisher=[[UGO.com]]|accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> Team Plasma is led by "[[Natural Harmonia Gropius|N]]", a young man who was brought up alongside Pok<U+00E9>mon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport.<ref name="GameFreak">{{cite video game|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Black Version/ Pok<U+00E9>mon White Version |developer=[[Game Freak]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]], [[The Pok<U+00E9>mon Company]]|date=2011-03-06|platform=[[Nintendo DS]]| scene=|level=|language=|isolang=|quote=}}</ref> Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Dragon Pok<U+00E9>mon of Unova and defeating the Pok<U+00E9>mon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pok<U+00E9>mon.

After the player defeats the Elite Four and enters the Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has defeated Alder and has become the newest Pok<U+00E9>mon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pok<U+00E9>mon League, challenging the player to find him to take part in one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in ''Black'' or Zekrom in ''White'' appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, as [[Pok<U+00E9>mon crime syndicates#Ghetsis|Ghetsis]] intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pok<U+00E9>mon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pok<U+00E9>mon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake about the nature of the relationship between people and their Pok<U+00E9>mon before leaving the castle on his captured Dragon Pok<U+00E9>mon to a far-off land.<ref name="GameFreak" />

After Team Plasma's defeat, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Fan Club President|Looker]] arrives in Unova and tasks the player with finding the remaining [[Pok<U+00E9>mon crime syndicates#Seven Sages|Sages of Team Plasma]], so they can be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pok<U+00E9>mon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pok<U+00E9>mon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pok<U+00E9>mon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pok<U+00E9>mon living in harmony. [[Cynthia (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Cynthia]], a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after [[Shigeki Morimoto]], a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, and the director of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games, can also be found and battled in the game.

When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon|species of Pok<U+00E9>mon]], Masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be able to know what is a good Pok<U+00E9>mon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/115/1152956p1.html |title=Struggling With Pokemon - Nintendo DS Feature at IGN |publisher=IGN |first=Richard |last=George |date=2011-03-01|accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref>

[[IGN]] gave the games a 9/10, a higher rating than any of the other [[Nintendo DS]] ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games. The review praised the games for renewing interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pok<U+00E9>mon designs, explaining that "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling".<ref name="IGN Review">{{cite web |title=Pokemon Black Review|publisher=IGN|last=DeVries |first=Jack |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-04|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/115/1153589p1.html}}</ref> Jeremy Parish of [[Retronauts]] criticized ''Black'' and ''White'', commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Mystery Dungeon]]'' games and ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' series games published before them.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Super-Effective Pokemon Talk|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120724162555/http://podcast.the1upnetwork.com/flat/Retronauts/R030611.mp3|archivedate=2012-07-24|url=http://podcast.the1upnetwork.com/flat/Retronauts/R030611.mp3|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> [[GamesRadar]] editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable.

===Changes===
''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' are set two years after the events of ''Black'' and ''White'', and much of the beginning events take place in new locations on the western side of the Unova region. These new locations also feature  several Pok<U+00E9>mon that were previously unavailable in ''Black'' and ''White'', featuring a total of 300 unique creatures available from the start of the game, including [[Psyduck]], [[Mareep]], [[Growlithe]], and [[Riolu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/122/1222863p1.html|title=Pokemon Black 2 and White 2: First Details|date=2012-04-12|accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>

A new game mechanic introduced in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' is the {{nihongo4|Pok<U+00E9>wood|<U+30DD><U+30B1><U+30A6><U+30C3><U+30C9>|Pokeuddo|"Pok<U+00E9>Star Studios" in the English release}} side game, where the player character participates in the filming of a movie involving Pok<U+00E9>mon and other actors.

===Plot===
The player and their rival begin their Pok<U+00E9>mon journey on the western side of Unova in the new Aspertia City, receiving their starter Pok<U+00E9>mon from Bianca, an NPC that served as one of the player's rivals in the previous ''Black'' and ''White''. The player also meets Cheren, the other rival character, who is now a Gym Leader in Aspertia City. Much like other ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games, the player travels around the region, battling Gym Leaders to acquire eight Gym Badges, and then goes on to challenge the Elite Four of the Pok<U+00E9>mon League and its champion to win the game.

The plot of ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' once again features the antagonistic Team Plasma, whom the player first encounters while running an errand, and later when travelling to the first other major city where the team announces its plans to take over the world and steal others' Pok<U+00E9>mon in front of the player, the rival, and new Gym Leader Roxie ({{nihongo4|Homika|<U+30DB><U+30DF><U+30AB>}} in Japan).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/b2w2/characters/character03.html|title=<U+30DB><U+30DF><U+30AB>|publisher=Pokemon.co.jp|accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> At the behest of Iris, the player helps Burgh track down more Team Plasma members in the sewers of Castelia City, where the player meets Colress ({{nihongo4|Achroma|<U+30A2><U+30AF><U+30ED><U+30DE>|Akuroma}} in Japan) for the first time, who claims to be a researcher of the strengths of Pok<U+00E9>mon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/b2w2/characters/character02.html|title=<U+30A2><U+30AF><U+30ED><U+30DE>|publisher=Pokemon.co.jp|accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref>

Later, it is revealed that the new Team Plasma has stolen a [[Purrloin]] the player's rival was planning on giving to his sister, which makes the rival angry towards the organization, including its reformed former members. After learning about the legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon Kyurem, which arrived at the Giant Chasm years ago, the player discovers that the new Team Plasma is working to use Kyurem to take over the world, harnessing its power to freeze large portions of Unova, including Opelucid City. The player tracks Team Plasma to Humilau City, home of the final new Pok<U+00E9>mon Gym led by Marlon ({{nihongo4|Shizui|<U+30B7><U+30BA><U+30A4>}} in Japan),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/b2w2/characters/character04.html|title=<U+30B7><U+30BA><U+30A4>|publisher=Pokemon.co.jp|accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> where he helps the player battle Team Plasma to remove Kyurem from their grasps, and to help the rival retrieve his Purrloin, which has since evolved into a [[Liepard]] that is used in battle against the player and rival.

The battle reaches its climax in the Giant Chasm, where the player discovers Colress has sided with Team Plasma to learn more about the capabilities of Pok<U+00E9>mon, and that Ghetsis is planning to use Kyurem, the "empty" Pok<U+00E9>mon that is left over from when Zekrom and Reshiram split apart hundreds of years ago, by filling it with his ambition to rule the world. After battling the Shadow Triad with help from the player's rival (receiving his Liepard back), the player enters the inner sanctum of the Giant Chasm where they find Kyurem and Ghetsis. N appears with either his Zekrom (''Black 2'')/Reshiram (''White 2'') to try to talk sense into his father Ghetsis, but N's legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon is defeated by and fused with Kyurem, transforming it into Black Kyurem (''Black 2'')/White Kyurem (''White 2''), and forcing the player to battle it. After defeating Kyurem, it separates from N's Pok<U+00E9>mon and the player faces Ghetsis, who is stunned that he has been defeated again. N tries to talk sense into him, but Ghetsis leaves, and N thanks the player for his assistance in defeating Team Plasma once and for all. After defeating Team Plasma, the player is finally able to battle the Elite Four and the New Champion of the Unova League, Iris, and win the game.

After the game's main story is completed, the player is able to challenge N who has taken up residence in his former castle, where upon the defeat of his legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon, it turns into the object that once held its essence and N gives it to the player. The player can then bring the item to another part of Unova where it transforms back into the Pok<U+00E9>mon and the player can then capture it. Also, after completion of the game, the player can battle former Unova Champion Alder, [[Sinnoh]] Champion Cynthia, the former Striaton City Gym Leaders, and take on the Black Tower or White Treehollow challenges in Black City or White Forest. Through use of a unique game feature called "Memory Link", the player can access new content and side quests dependent on the original ''Black'' and ''White'' games, such as references to the player's name in the previous game, flashback sequences, the ability to capture Pok<U+00E9>mon that once belonged to N, battling Cheren and Bianca who reminisce about the protagonist of the previous game, and participating in the Pok<U+00E9>mon World Tournament.

===Music===
''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black 2'' and ''White'' 2 background music contains the music of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' and ''White'', adds a lot of brand new tracks, and utilizes the arrangements of most tracks from ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Black'' and ''White''.
