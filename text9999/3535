'''''J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings''''' is a 1978 [[animation|animated]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]]. It is an adaptation of the first half of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Set in [[Middle-earth]], the film follows a group of [[hobbit]]s, [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|men]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]] and [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizards]] who form a [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]]. They embark on a quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] made by the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], and ensure his destruction. The film features the voices of [[William Squire]], [[John Hurt]], [[Michael Graham Cox]] and [[Anthony Daniels]]. The screenplay was written by [[Peter S. Beagle]], based on an earlier draft by Chris Conkling.<ref name="Screenplays">{{cite web |url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm |title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle |accessdate=2007-01-09 |last=Croft |first=Janet Brennan |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=University of Oklahoma |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 

Director Ralph Bakshi encountered Tolkien's writing early in his career, and had made several attempts to produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as an animated film before being given funding by producer [[Saul Zaentz]] and distributor [[United Artists]].<ref name="Jim Hill Media">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Jim Korkis |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The film is notable for its extensive use of [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]], a technique in which scenes are first shot in live-action, then traced onto animation [[cel]]s.<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/> Although the film was a financial success,<ref name="Maltin">{{cite book | title = Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons | author = Maltin, Leonard | year = 1987 | publisher = Plume | location = | id = ISBN 0-978-0452259935}}</ref><ref name="Sacks">{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Terence J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Opportunities in Animation and Cartooning Careers |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2000 |month= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location= |language= |isbn=0658001833 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=page 37 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> it received a mixed reaction from critics, and the original distributors refused to fund a sequel to cover the remainder of the story. However, the film sparked new interest in Tolkien's writing, inspiring the production of several further adaptations of the story.

==Plot==

Early in the [[Second Age]] of [[Middle-earth]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elven]] smiths forged nineteen [[Rings of Power]] for mortal [[Man (Middle-earth)|men]], the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf-Lords]], and the Elf-Kings. At the same time, the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] made the [[One Ring]] to rule them all. As the [[Last Alliance|Last Alliance of men and elves]] fell, the Ring fell into the hands of Prince [[Isildur]] from [[N<U+00FA>menor|across the sea]], and after Isildur was killed by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]], the Ring lay at the bottom of the river [[Anduin]]. Over time, Sauron captured the nine Rings made for men and turned their owners into the [[Nazg<U+00FB>l|Ringwraiths]], terrible beings who roamed the world searching for the One Ring. The Ring was found by two friends, one of whom, Sm<U+00E9>agol, was so enticed by the Ring's power that he killed his friend [[D<U+00E9>agol]] to get it. The Ring warped him into a twisted, gurgling wretch known only as [[Gollum]].  His "precious" Ring was later accidentally discovered and taken by the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]]. 

Years later, during Bilbo's birthday celebrations in the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], the wizard [[Gandalf]] tells him to leave the Ring for [[Frodo Baggins]]. Bilbo agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that the Shire is in danger: evil forces have learned that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets with Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses to all of Middle-earth. Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him.

He is accompanied by three hobbit friends, [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Sam Gamgee|Sam]]. After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths pursuing them, the hobbits eventually come to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], where they meet [[Aragorn]] (who is first introduced to them as Strider), a friend of Gandalf's, who leads them the rest of the way to [[Rivendell]]. Frodo is stabbed atop [[Weathertop]] mountain by the [[Witch-king of Angmar|chief of the Ringwraiths]] with a knife imbued with evil magic. Part of the knife stays inside him, and he gets sicker as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the elf [[Legolas]], and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the enchanted river. At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by its lord, [[Elrond]]. He meets Gandalf again, held captive by his fellow wizard [[Saruman]], who plans to join with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. Bilbo, Gandalf, and the others argue about what should be done with the One Ring, and Frodo volunteers to go to [[Mordor]], where the Ring can be destroyed. Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; [[Boromir]], son of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] of [[Gondor]]; Legolas; [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] the dwarf; and Frodo's original three hobbit companions.
[[Image:Bakshi Orcs.jpg|thumb|left|The Fellowship encounters Orcs in [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].]]
Their attempt to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced to take a path under the mountains via [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. Moria was an ancient dwarf kingdom, but is now full of orcs and other evil creatures, and Gandalf falls into an abyss after battling a [[balrog]]. The remaining eight members of the Fellowship continue through the elf-haven [[Lothl<U+00F3>rien]], but Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo. Frodo decides to leave the others behind and continue his quest alone, although faithful Sam insists on accompanying him.

Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. They are captured by the orcs, who intend to take them to Isengard through the land of [[Rohan]].  The hobbits escape and flee into Fangorn Forest, where they meet [[Treebeard]], a huge [[Ent (Middle-earth)|tree-like creature]]. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track Merry and Pippin; they find small footprints and follow them into Fangorn Forest.  There, they find Gandalf, whom they had believed dead in the mines of Moria. The four ride to Rohan's capital, [[Edoras]], where Gandalf persuades King [[Th<U+00E9>oden]] that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas then travel to the defensive fortification [[Helm's Deep]]. 

Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, discover Gollum stalking them, and capture him. Frodo pities him, and lets him live in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Mordor. At Helm's Deep, Th<U+00E9>oden's forces struggle to resist an onslaught of orcs sent by Saruman.  Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Riders of Rohan just in time, destroying the orc army.

==Production==
Director Ralph Bakshi was introduced to ''The Lord of the Rings'' during the mid-1950s while working as an animator for [[Terrytoons]]. In 1957, the young animator started trying to convince people that the story could be told in [[animation]].<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/> At the time, the film rights to the story were held by [[Walt Disney]],<ref name="Beck">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=page 155 |isbn=9781556525919 }}</ref> but in 1968, the rights were passed to [[United Artists]], where filmmakers [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[John Boorman]] each tried to adapt the story.<ref name="Beck"/>

In the mid-1970s, Bakshi, who had since achieved box office success producing adult-oriented animated films such as ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'', learned of UA and Boorman's attempts to adapt the story. He was told that Boorman had planned to produce all three parts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a single film, and commented, "I thought that was madness, certainly a lack of character on Boorman's part. Why would you want to tamper with anything Tolkien did?"<ref name="A.V. Club">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22810 |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Robinson, Tasha |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 31, 2003 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Onion A.V. Club |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> When Boorman's [[Adaptations of The Lord of the Rings#Early efforts|proposed adaptation]] fell apart, Bakshi approached the studio and proposed that he direct a three-part animated film adaptation of the book: 

{{quote|"They said fine, because Boorman handed in this 700-page script, and do I want to read it? I said, 'Well, is it all three books in one?' They said, 'Yes, but he's changed a lot of the characters, and he's added characters. He's got some sneakers he's merchandising in the middle.' I said, 'No, I'd rather not read it. I'd rather do the books as close as we can, using Tolkien's exact dialogue and scenes.' They said, 'Fine,' which knocked me down, 'because we don't understand a word Boorman wrote. We never read the books. [...] We ain't got time to read it. You understand it, Ralph, so go do it.'"|Director Ralph Bakshi<ref name="A.V. Club"/>}}

The [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] office was located in the same building, and Bakshi spoke to then-president Dan Melnick. "I thought he would understand what ''The Rings'' meant, because UA did not."<ref name="A.V. Club"/> Bakshi and Melnick made a deal with Mike Medavoy at United Artists to buy the Boorman script. "The Boorman script cost $3 million, so Boorman was happy by the pool, screaming and laughing and drinking, 'cause he got $3 million for his script to be thrown out."<ref name="A.V. Club"/> However, after Melnick was fired from MGM, the deal fell through.<ref name="A.V. Club"/> Bakshi then contacted Saul Zaentz (who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'') to ask him to produce ''The Lord of the Rings'', and Zaentz agreed. Before the production started, the original three-part adaptation was negotiated down to two parts at United Artists, and Bakshi met with Tolkien's daughter Priscilla to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing. Bakshi says, "My promise to Tolkien's daughter was to be pure to the book. I wasn't going to say, 'Hey, throw out Gollum and change these two characters.' My job was to say, 'This is what the genius said.'"<ref name="Fox News">{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 7, 2000 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Fox News |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

===Direction===
[[Image:RBLorcamera.jpg|thumb|right|Ralph Bakshi looks into the camera lens during the live-action shoot.]]
Ralph Bakshi states that one of the problems with the production was that the film was an [[epic film|epic]], because "epics tend to drag. The biggest challenge was to be true to the book."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/> When asked what he was trying to accomplish with the film, Bakshi stated "The goal was to bring as much quality as possible to the work. I wanted real illustration as opposed to cartoons."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/> Bakshi states that descriptions were removed because they are seen in the film:

{{quote|"It's not that important to me how a hobbit looks. Everyone has their own idea of what the characters look like. It's important to me that the energy of Tolkien survives. It's important that the quality of animation matches the quality of Tolkien. Who cares how big Gandalf's nose is? The tendency of animation is just to worry about the drawing. If the movie works, whether you agree about Bilbo's face or not, the rest becomes inconsequential."|Ralph Bakshi<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/>}}

Bakshi's major artistic influences on the film were classical illustrators such as [[Howard Pyle]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]]; he stated that no contemporary illustrators were an influence on the style of the film. 

{{quote|"The film is a clash of a lot of styles like in all my films. I like moody backgrounds. I like drama. I like a lot of saturated color. Of course, a big problem was controlling the artists so they drew alike. How do you have 600 people draw one character alike? The tendency is to want to let the artist have some freedom but then someone would leave off a hat or horn on a hat on a character. [...] I think we've achieved real illustration as opposed to cartoons. Artistically, we can do anything we want."|Ralph Bakshi<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/>}}

===Screenwriting and development===
An early draft of the screenplay was written by Chris Conkling,<ref name="Beck"/> who told the bulk of the story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view.<ref name="Screenplays"/> After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author [[Peter S. Beagle]] was called in for a rewrite.<ref name="Screenplays"/><ref name="Beck"/> According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.<ref name="Beagle">{{cite web |url=http://www.conlanpress.com/html/zaentz_f.html |title=Beagle/Zaentz FAQ |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Conlan Press |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

The film makes some deviations from the book, but overall follows Tolkien's narrative quite closely. Of the adaptation process, Bakshi stated that elements of the story "had to be left out but nothing in the story was really altered."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/> The film greatly condenses Frodo's journey from Bag End to Bree. Stop-overs at [[Farmer Maggot]]'s house, Frodo's home in Buckland, and the house of the mysterious [[Tom Bombadil]] deep in the Old Forest are omitted. Maggot and his family and Bombadil and his wife [[Goldberry]] are thus all omitted, along with [[Fredegar Bolger|Fatty Bolger]], a hobbit who accompanied Frodo at the beginning. According to Bakshi, the character of Tom Bombadil was "dropped" because "he didn't move the story along."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/>

Some changes were cosmetic in nature. For example, Saruman the White adopts the title "Saruman of Many Colours" as in Tolkien's novel. In it he initially wore white but modified his robe.<ref name="elrond">{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Council of Elrond"}}</ref> However, in the film his robes are neither white nor multicolored, but are in different shades of red. Legolas wears silver and grey clothes whereas in the book he is "clad in green and brown".<ref name="elrond"/> Aragorn too wore "rusty green and brown"<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Ring Goes South"}}</ref> in the book whereas his garments are in different shades of brown in the film. Boromir wears a [[horned helmet]], which has no precedent in the book.

The scene where the Ringwraiths arrive in the hobbits' room and slash at their beds, only to find that they are not there, is not in the book, only the discovery of the aftermath.<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"At the Sign of the Prancing Pony"}}</ref> Also, Tolkien implies that the attack was carried out by agents of the Ringwraiths in Bree, possibly including one [[Bill Ferny]], not the Ringwraiths themselves (though they were present in the town). <!--Copyeditor's note: is this relevant? If not, please delete: "As Aragorn states, "In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people - not until they are desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too."<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"Strider"}}</ref>"-->

The depiction of the [[Battle of the Hornburg|battle of Helm's Deep]] differs in some details from the book. Notably, the fortress itself is called "Helm's Deep" in the film while in the book it was called the "Hornburg", and "Helm's Deep" is the name of the valley where it is located,<ref name="helm's deep">{{ME-ref|ttt|"Helm's Deep"}}</ref> or more precisely, the ravine behind the fortress.<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#210}}</ref> The explosive-like "blasting-fire", here the "Fire of Isengard," appears as magical projectiles shot from Isengard itself. <U+00C9>omer is portrayed as a renegade found by Gandalf; together, they save the day at Helm's Deep. In the book, he was present at the battle, and Gandalf arrives with Erkenbrand.<ref name="helm's deep"/>

===Animation===
[[Image:LOTR cast.jpg|thumb|right|Many scenes were shot in live-action and [[rotoscope]]d. Director Ralph Bakshi is seen here posing with the rotoscope models during the shooting of the live-action sequences.]]
Publicity for the film announced that Bakshi had created "the first movie painting" by utilizing "an entirely new technique in filmmaking."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/> Much of the film used live-action footage which was then [[rotoscope]]d to produce an animated look.<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/> This saved production costs and gave the animated characters a more realistic look. Animation historian [[Jerry Beck]] wrote in ''The Animated Movie Guide'' that "up to that point, animated films had not depicted extensive battle scenes with hundreds of characters. By using the rotoscope, Bakshi could trace highly complex scenes from live-action footage and transform them into animation, thereby taking advantage of the complexity live-action film can capture without incurring the exorbitant costs of producing a live-action film."<ref name="Beck"/>

{{quote|"I was told that at Disney the actor was told to play it like a cartoon with all that exaggeration. In ''Lord of the Rings'', I had the actors play it straight. The rotoscope in the past has been used in scenes and then exaggerated. The action becomes cartoony. The question then comes up that if you're not going to be cartoony, why animate? [...] It is the traditional method of rotoscoping but the approach is untraditional. It's a rotoscope realism unlike anything that's been seen. It really is a unique thing for animation. The number of characters moving in a scene is staggering. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', you have hundreds of people in the scene. We have cels with a thousand people on them. It was so complex sometimes we'd only get one cel a week from an artist. It turned out that the simple shots were the ones that only had four people in them."|Ralph Bakshi<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/>}}

For the live-action portion of the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the rotoscope models acted out their parts in costume. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by [[Billy Barty]], while [[Sharon Baird]] served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/fullcredits |title=''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978) - Full cast and crew |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film,<ref name="Deleted scenes">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/films.php?film=thelordoftherings_bonus |title=''The Lord of the Rings'' - deleted scenes |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Official Ralph Bakshi website |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref name="Hobbits">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/albums/userpics/10001/normal_701.JPG.JPG |title=''The Lord of the Rings'' - gallery image |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Official Ralph Bakshi website |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is [[posterization|posterized]] to produce a more three-dimensional look. In a few shots the two techniques are combined. 

Bakshi claimed he "didn't start thinking about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved back and forth on the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/>

Following the live-action shoot, each frame of the live footage was printed out, and placed behind an animation cel. The details of each frame were copied and painted onto the cel. Both the live-action and animated sequences were storyboarded.<ref name="Rotoscope-2">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=20 |title=''The Lord of the Rings'' - gallery image |accessdate=2007-08-08 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Official Ralph Bakshi website |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Of the production, Bakshi is quoted as saying, 
{{quote|"Making two pictures [The live action reference and the actual animated feature.] in two years is crazy. Most directors when they finish editing, they are finished; we were just starting. I got more than I expected. The crew is young. The crew loves it. If the crew loves it, it's usually a great sign. They aren't older animators trying to snow me for jobs next year."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/>}}

Although he continued to use rotoscoping in ''[[American Pop]]'', ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]'', and ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'', Bakshi later regretted his use of rotoscoping, stating that he felt that it was a mistake to trace the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name="DirectorsSeries">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968&hl=en |title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One) |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last=Gallagher |first=John A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1983 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> [[Tim Burton]] worked as a cel painter on the film.

===Sequel===
[[Image:Lotr78.jpg|thumb|Later poster depicting a scene not featured in the film that may have been intended for the unproduced sequel.]]
The film was originally intended to be distributed as ''The Lord of the Rings Part One''.<ref name="A.V. Club"/><ref name="Fox News"/> According to Bakshi, when he completed the film, United Artists executives told him that they were planning to release the film without indicating that a sequel would follow, because they felt that audiences would not pay to see half of a film. 

{{quote|"I told them they can't drop the Part One, because people are going to come in thinking they'll see the whole film, and it's not there. We had a huge fight, and they released it as ''Lord Of The Rings''. So when it came to the end, people were stunned in the theater, even worse than I ever realized they would be, because they were expecting to see the whole film. People keep telling me I never finished the film. And I keep saying, 'That's right!'"<ref name="A.V. Club"/>}}

{{quote|"Had it said 'Part One,' I think everyone would have respected it. But because it didn't say 'Part One,' everyone came in expecting to see the entire three books, and that's where the confusion comes in."<ref name="Fox News"/>}}

''The Film Book of J.R.R. Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings'', published by [[Ballantine Books]] on [[October 12]], [[1978]], still referred to the sequel in the book's inside cover jacket.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Film Book of J.R.R.

Bakshi also stated that he felt that the film "took more out of me than I got back."
{{quote|"[The film] made me realize that I'm not interested in [adapting another writer's story].

==Reception==
''The Lord of the Rings'' was a financial success. The film grossed $30.5 million at the [[box office]]<ref name="Beck"/> (the budget was $4 million).<ref name="Beck"/> In [[Leonard Maltin]]'s book ''Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons'', Maltin cites ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''Fritz the Cat'' as the only major box office successes of Bakshi's career.<ref name="Maltin"/> The film was nominated for both the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[The Saturn Awards|Saturn]] Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation and Best Fanatasy Film, respectively. Leonard Rosenman's score was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Motion Picture Score, and Bakshi won a Golden Gryphon award for the film at the Giffani Film Festival.<ref name="IMDb-awards">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/awards |title=Awards for ''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978) |accessdate=2007-12-19 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>

===Critical response===
Critics were generally mixed in their responses to the film.<ref name="Beck"/> In ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Frank Barrow wrote that the film was "daring and unusual in concept."<ref name="Beck"/> Joseph Gelmis of ''[[Newsday]]'' wrote that "the film's principal reward is a visual experience unlike anything that other animated features are doing at the moment."<ref name="Beck"/> [[Roger Ebert]] called Bakshi's effort a "mixed blessing" and "an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job ...

===Recognition===
The film has been cited as an influence on director Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|film trilogy]] based on ''The Lord of the Rings''. After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered ''The Lord of the Rings'' via Bakshi's film, stating that while the film was a "brave and ambitious attempt," he wasn't initially inspired to read the books.<ref>[[Peter Jackson]], as quoted at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre|Egyptian Theater]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], on February 6th, 2004. [http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 Audio]; Retrieved on 2007-08-22.</ref> In another interview, Jackson stated that he "enjoyed [the film] and wanted to know more."<ref name="Jackson">{{cite web |url=http://chud.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38299 |title=Peter Jackson interview |accessdate=2007-08-22 |accessmonthday= |accessdaymonth= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October/November 2001 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=''Explorations'' (the Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter) |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312050233/http://chud.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-38299.html|archivedate=2001-10-10 |quote= }}</ref> Bakshi is quoted as saying "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up."<ref name="IGN"/> Jackson's adaptation borrows from Bakshi's version. On the [[audio commentary]] for the DVD release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.

Bakshi is quoted as saying that he had "mixed feeling[s]" about Jackson's adaptations, although he had not seen the films. "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] [Nor] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at<U+2014>I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget."<ref name="IGN"/>

===Legacy===
The film was adapted into [[comic book]] form with artwork by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Luis Bermejo]], under license from [[Tolkien Enterprises]]. Three issues were published for the [[Europe]]an market, starting in 1979, and were not published in the [[United States]] or translated into [[English language|English]] due to copyright problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/miscellanea/comics/description.htm |title=J.R.R.Tolkien comics  |accessdate=2007-08-22 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=J.R.R.

Bakshi's film sparked enough interest in Tolkien's work to provoke not only an animated [[TV special]] produced by the [[Rankin-Bass]] animation studio based on ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', but a complete [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] on [[BBC Radio]]. For this broadcast, Michael Graham Cox and Peter Woodthorpe reprised their roles of Boromir and Gollum, respectively. 

[[Warner Bros.]] (the rights holder to the post-1974 Rankin-Bass library and most of the Saul Zaentz theatrical backlog) has released ''The Hobbit,'' ''The Lord of the Rings,'' and ''The Return of the King'' on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]], both packaged separately and as a boxed-set "trilogy" of films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/J-R-R-Tolkien-Animated-Hobbit-Return/dp/B00005UM49/ref=sr_1_1/105-4130415-0230007?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1186252506&sr=1-1 |title=ASIN: B00005UM49 |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/J-R-R-Tolkien-Giftset-Hobbit-Return/dp/B00005RJ2W/ref=sr_1_1/105-4130415-0230007?ie=UTF8&s=video&qid=1186252593&sr=1-1 |title=ASIN: B00005RJ2W |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' is currently out of print as a separate release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Christopher-Guard/dp/B00005MP5B/ref=sr_1_2/105-4130415-0230007?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1186252678&sr=1-2 |title=ASIN: B00005MP5B |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> In 2003, the [[Online Film Critics Society]] ranked the film as the 90th greatest animated film of all time.<ref name="OFCS">{{cite web |url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated  |title=Top 100 Animated Features of All Time |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Online Film Critics Society]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>
