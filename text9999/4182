{{History of Scotland}}
'''Scandinavian Scotland''' refers to the period from the 8th to the 15th centuries during which [[Viking]]s, [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlers and their descendents colonised parts of what is now modern Scotland. Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and hostility between the Scandinavian [[Earl of Orkney|Earls of Orkney]] and the emerging [[thalassocracy]] of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]], and the rulers of Ireland, [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] and [[Alba]], and intervention by the crown of [[Norway]] were recurring themes.

Scandinavian-held territories included the [[Northern Isles]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], the [[Hebrides]], the [[Islands of the Clyde|islands of the Firth of Clyde]], the [[Isle of Man]] and associated mainland territories including [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]].  The historical record is weak and the Irish annals and the later Norse sagas, of which the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'' is the principal source of information, are sometimes contradictory although modern [[archaeology]] is beginning to provide a broader picture of life during this period.

There are various competing theories that have addressed the early colonisation process although it is clear that the Northern Isles were the first to be conquered by Vikings and the last to be relinquished by the Norwegian crown. [[Thorfinn the Mighty|Thorfinn Sigurdsson]]'s rule in the 11th century included expansion well into north mainland Scotland and this may have been the zenith of Scandinavian influence. The obliteration of pre-Norse names in the Hebrides and their replacement with Norse ones was almost total although the emergence of alliances with the native [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speakers produced a powerful [[Norse-Gael]] culture that had wide influence in [[Argyll]], [[Galloway]] and beyond.

Scottish influence increased from the 13th century on. In 1231 an unbroken line of Norse earls of Orkney ended and the title was henceforward held by Scots nobles. An ill-fated expedition by [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonarson]] later in that century led to the relinquishing of the islands of the west to the Scottish Crown and in the mid-15th century Orkney and Shetland were also transferred to Scottish rule.

The negative view of Viking activities held in popular imagination notwithstanding,<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 200</ref> Norse expansion may have been a motive factor in the emergence of the Gaelic kingdom of Alba, the forerunner of modern Scotland, and the trading, political, cultural and religious achievements of the later periods of Norse rule were significant.

==Geography==
[[Image:Kingdom of Mann and the Isles-en.svg|thumb|Norse [[List of islands of Scotland|Scottish island]] possessions in the 12th century]]
The [[Northern Isles]], known to the Norse as the ''Nor<U+00F0>reyjar'', are the closest parts of the [[United Kingdom]] to Norway and these islands experienced the first and most long-lasting Norse influence of any part of Scotland. Shetland is some {{convert|300|km|mi}} due west of Norway<ref name=Philips6>''Philip's World Atlas'' (1999) p. 6</ref><ref name=Philips14>''Philip's World Atlas'' (1999) p. 14</ref> and in favourable conditions could be reached in 24 hours from [[Hordaland]] in a Viking [[longship]].<ref>Crawford (1987) pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref> Orkney is {{convert|80|km|mi}} further to the south west.<ref name=Philips6/> 

Some {{convert|16|km|mi|0}} due south of Orkney is the Scottish mainland.<ref name=Philips12>''Philip's World Atlas'' (1999) p. 12</ref> The two most northerly provinces of mainland Scotland, [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]], fell under Norse control at an early date. South of there the entire western seaboard of mainland Scotland from [[Wester Ross]] to [[Kintyre]] was also subject to significant Scandinavian influence. 

The ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'', or "Southern Isles" include:
* The Hebrides or Western Isles comprising:{{#tag:ref|Murray (1973) notes that "Western Isles" has tended to mean "Outer Hebrides" since the creation of the [[Na h-Eileanan an Iar (UK Parliament constituency)|Na h-Eileanan an Iar]] or Western Isles parliamentary constituency in 1918. The phrase can also be used to refer to the Hebrides in general, which is the usage here throughout.<ref>Murray (1973) p. 32</ref>|group="Note"}} 
** The [[Outer Hebrides]], aka the "Long Island" to the west, separated from the northern Inner Hebrides by the waters of the [[Minch]]. These islands are some {{convert|180|km|mi}} west of Orkney.<ref name=Philips12/>
** The [[Inner Hebrides]] including [[Skye]], [[Islay]], [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] and [[Iona]].
* The islands of the [[Firth of Clyde]] some {{convert|140|km|mi}} to the south, the largest of which are [[Isle of Bute|Bute]] and [[Isle of Arran|Arran]].<ref name=Philips12/>
* The [[Isle of Man]], located in the [[Irish Sea]] equidistantly from modern England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales<ref name=Philips10>''Philip's World Atlas'' (1999) p. 10</ref>
The total distance from the southern tip of the Isle of Man to the [[Butt of Lewis]], the northern extremity of the Outer Hebrides, is approximately {{convert|515|km|mi}}.<ref name=Philips14/> This entire region became dominated by Norse culture for much of the period under consideration. For example, it is likely that the Norse language became as dominant throughout the Inner Hebrides as it did on [[Lewis]] during the 10th and 11th centuries.<ref name=W297>Woolf (2007) p. 297</ref><ref>Woolf (2007) pp. 328<U+2013>29</ref><ref name="Barrett" /> 

There was also significant direct Norse influence exerted in [[Galloway]] in south west Scotland<ref name=GCB203/> and for much of the period, up until the 1266 Treaty of Perth, Norwegian and Danish foreign policy and the activities of independent or semi-independent Norse rulers of the above parts of Scandinavian-dominated Scotland had a powerful influence on the affairs of Scotland as a whole.<ref name=OC431/><ref name=Oram48/><ref name=Burns48/>

==Colonisation process==
Scholarly interpretations of the period "have led to widely divergent reconstructions of Viking Age Scotland"<ref>Barrett (2008) p. 412</ref> especially in the early period and Barrett (2008) has identified four competing theories, none of which he regards as proven.<ref name=B419>Barrett (2008) pp. 419, 422</ref> 
[[File:Scarba and The Strait of Coryvreckan - geograph.org.uk - 20844.jpg|thumb|The [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]] between [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Scarba]]. According to tradition "Prince Breacan of [[Lochlann]]" was shipwrecked there with a fleet of fifty ships.<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 51</ref><ref> Murray (1966) pp. 71<U+2013>2</ref>]]
The traditional explanation is the earldom hypothesis. This assumes a period of Norse expansion into the Northern Isles and the creation of an aristocratic dynasty that lasted well into the Medieval period, which exerted considerable influence in western Scotland and Mann into the 11th century. This version of events is essentially as told by the Norse sagas and as noted above is supported by some archaeological evidence although it has been criticised for exaggerating Orcadian influence in the ''Su<U+00F0>reyar''.<ref name=B419/>

The second of these theories is the [[genocide]] hypothesis, which asserts that the aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin throughout much of the region.<ref name=B419/> Its weakness is that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial.<ref>Thomson (2008) pp. 43<U+2013>50.</ref> Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.<ref name=Goodacre>Goodacre, S. ''et al'' (2005) [http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v95/n2/full/6800661a.html#bib14 "Genetic evidence for a family-based Scandinavian settlement of Shetland and Orkney during the Viking periods"] ''Heredity'' '''95''', pp. 129<U+2013>135. Nature.com. Retrieved 20 Mar 2011.</ref>

The pagan reaction hypothesis proposed by Bjorn Mhyre suggests  a long tradition of mobility amongst the various populations of the North Atlantic seaboard and that the expansion of Christian missions resulted in ethnic tensions that led to or exacerbated [[Viking expansion]]. There is some evidence of such mobility, such as Irish missionary activities in [[Iceland]] and [[Faroe Islands|The Faroes]] in the 8th century, but little that is conclusive.<ref name=B419/><ref><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (2008) p. 428</ref>

The fourth suggestion is the ''[[Lochlann|Laithlind]]'' or Lochlann hypothesis. This word appears in various forms in the early Irish literature and is usually assumed to refer to Norway itself, although some have preferred to locate it in the Norse-dominated parts of Scotland.<ref>Woolf (2007)  pp. 107<U+2013>108 & 286<U+2013>289</ref> [[Donnchadh <U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in]] is a proponent of this view and claims that that a substantial part of Scotland<U+2014>the Northern and Western Isles and large areas of the coastal mainland<U+2014>were conquered by the Vikings in the first quarter of the 9th century and that a Viking kingdom was set up there earlier than the middle of the century.<ref><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1998) various pages.</ref> Essentially a variant of the earldom hypothesis, there is little archaeological evidence in its favour,<ref name=B419/> although it is clear that extensive Viking incursions on the Irish coasts were supported by a presence of some kind in the [[Hebrides]], even if the date the latter became prominent is far from certain.{{#tag:ref|Barret (2008) suggest a "late, mid-ninth-century" date for Viking settlement and raids "launched from bases in Atlantic Scotland" but notes a variety of other options suggested by scholars.<ref name=B419/>|group="Note"}}  As <U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in himself admits "when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable".<ref><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1998) p. 25</ref>

==Early Viking incursions==
Norse contacts with Scotland certainly predate the first written records in the 8th century, but their nature  and frequency are unknown.<ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 2, 23</ref>
From 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded.

==''Nor<U+00F0>reyjar''==
The Northern Isles were  "Pictish in culture and speech"<ref name="H44"/> prior to the Norse incursions, and although it is recorded that Orkney was "destroyed" by King [[Bridei III of the Picts|Bridei]] in 682 it is not likely that the Pictish kings exerted a significant degree of ongoing control over island affairs.<ref name=H44>Hunter (2000) pp. 44, 49</ref><ref>Jennings and Kruse (2007) p. 78</ref> According to the ''Orkneyinga Saga'', about 872 [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]] became [[Monarchy of Norway|King of a united Norway]] and many of his opponents fled to the [[List of islands of Scotland|islands of Scotland]]. Harald pursued his enemies and incorporated the Northern Isles into his kingdom in 875 and then, perhaps a little over a decade later, the Hebrides as well. The following year the local Viking chieftains of the Hebrides rebelled. Harald then sent [[Ketill Flatnose]] to subdue them. Ketill achieved this quickly but then declared himself an independent "King of the Isles", a title he retained for the rest of his life.<ref>Gregory (1881) p. 4</ref> Hunter (2000) states that Ketill was "in charge of an extensive island realm and, as a result, sufficiently prestigious to contemplate the making of agreements and alliances with other princelings".<ref>Hunter (2000) p. 78</ref>{{#tag:ref|Ketill Flatnose is also sometimes equated with Caittil Find although this connection is far from definite.

Nonetheless, the Norse tradition states that [[Rognvald Eysteinsson]] received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]].<ref>Thomson (2008) p. 24</ref> Sigurd's line barely survived him and it was [[Torf-Einarr]], Rognvald's son by a slave, who founded a dynasty that controlled the Northern Isles for centuries after his death.<ref>Thomson (2008) p. 29</ref>{{#tag:ref|Sigurd the Mighty's son Gurthorm ruled for a single winter after Sigurd's death and died childless.

In [[Old Irish|early Irish]] literature Shetland is referred to as ''Inse Catt''<U+2014>"the Isles of Cats", which may have been the pre-Norse inhabitants' name for these islands. The [[Kingdom of Cait|Cat tribe]] certainly occupied parts of the northern Scottish mainland and their name can be found in [[Caithness]], and in the Gaelic name for [[Sutherland]] (''Cataibh'', meaning "among the Cats").<ref>Watson (2005) p. 30</ref> There is limited evidence that Caithness may have had an intermediate phase of Gaelic-speaking control between the Pictish era and the Norse takeover,<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 306</ref> but if it existed it is likely to have been short-lived.

[[Thorfinn the Mighty|Thorfinn Sigurdsson]] expanded his father's realm south beyond Sutherland<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 72</ref> and by the 11th century the Norwegian crown had come to accept that Caithness was held by the Earls of Orkney as a fiefdom from the Kings of Scotland although its Norse character  was retained throughout the 13th century.<ref>Imsen (2007) pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref> [[Raghnall mac Gofraidh]] was granted Caithness after assisting the Scots king in a conflict with [[Harald Maddadson]], an earl of Orkney in the early 13th century.{{#tag:ref|Although the  ''Orkneyinga Saga'' states that this story is about Raghnall mac Gofraidh it also relates that Ingibj<U+00F6>rg H<U+00E1>konard<U+00F3>ttir, the daughter of Earl [[Hakon Paulsson]] was his mother.

In the [[Firth of Clyde]], Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not Bute and place name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around [[Largs]] and an ornate silver brooch was found on a hillside near [[Hunterston]] that is of likely 7th century Irish origin but with a 10th century runic inscription.<ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 96<U+2013>98</ref> Five [[Hogback (sculpture)|Hogback]] monuments found in [[Govan]] hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.<ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 100<U+2013>01</ref>

The Isle of Man (which was absorbed into Scotland from 1266 until the 14th century) was dominated by the Norse-Gaels from an early date and from 1079 onwards by the [[Crovan dynasty]] as attested by the ''[[Chronicles of Mann]]'' and evidenced by the numerous [[Manx Runestones]] and Norse place names.<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 215</ref><ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) p. 111</ref>  The modern-day [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]] retains the centuries-old name.

South of Sutherland there is considerable place name evidence of Norse settlement along the entire western coast, although unlike on the islands the settlement in the south seems to have been less prolonged and undertaken  in tandem with pre-existing settlement rather than replacing it entirely. The distinction between the ''Innse Gall'' (islands of the foreigners) and the [[Argyll|''Airer Goidel'']] (coastland of the Gael) is further suggestive of a distinction between island and mainland at an early date.<ref name = Kruse97/><ref>Woolf (2006) pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> In [[Wester Ross]] most of the Gaelic names that exist on the coastline today are of likely Medieval rather than pre-Norse origin<ref>Jennings and Kruse (2007) pp. 87, 90, 95</ref> and a now-lost charter refers to the mainland village of [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]] opposite Skye as having been in the possession of the king of Man.<ref name=CR25>Crawford (1987) p. 25</ref> As in Orkney and Shetland, Pictish seems to have been entirely replaced wherever the Norse encountered it.

In the 9th century the first references to the ''[[Norse-Gaels|Gallg<U+00E1>edil]]'' (i.e. "foreign Gaels") appear. This term was variously used in succeeding centuries to refer to individuals of mixed Scandinavian-Celtic descent and/or culture who became dominant in west and south-west Scotland, parts of northern England and the isles.<ref>Woolf (2007) pp. 253, 296<U+2013>97</ref> This alliance between the two cultures, which also took place in Ireland,<ref name=OC430><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (2008) p. 430</ref> may have been instrumental in saving the Gaels of D<U+00E1>l Riata from the fate of the Picts in the north and west.<ref>Jennings and Kruse (2007) pp. 98<U+2013>99</ref> Evidence for Norse settlement in mainland Argyll is limited<ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref> although the [[Port an Eilean Mh<U+00F2>ir ship burial]] in [[Ardnamurchan]] is the first boat burial site to be discovered on the mainland of [[Great Britain|Britain]].<ref>Ross, David (19 Oct 2011). "Britain's first intact Viking boat burial site unearthed". Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''.</ref>

==South west Scotland==
By the mid 10th century [[Amla<U+00ED>b Cuar<U+00E1>n]]  controlled [[Wigtownshire|The Rhinns]]<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 254</ref> and the region gets the modern name of Galloway from the mixture of Viking and Gaelic Irish settlement that produced the Gall-Gaidel.<ref>Logan, (1992) p. 49</ref> Magnus Barelegs is said to have "subdued the people of Galloway"<ref name=GCB106/> in the 11th century and [[Whithorn]] seems to have been a centre of Hiberno-Norse artisans who traded around the [[Irish Sea]] by the end of the first millennium.<ref name=GCB203>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) p. 203</ref> However, the place name, written and archaeological evidence of extensive Norse (as opposed to Norse-Gael) settlement in the area is not convincing.<ref name=GCB106>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 106<U+2013>08</ref>

The ounceland system seems to have become widespread down the west coast including much of Argyll and this is just as true of most of the south west apart from land adjacent to the inner [[Solway Firth]]. In [[Dumfries and Galloway]] the place name evidence is complex and of mixed Gaelic, Norse and [[Danish language|Danish]] influence, the last most likely stemming from contact with the extensive Danish holdings in northern England.<ref name=C87>Crawford (1987) pp. 87, 93, 98</ref> One feature of the area is the number of names with a "[[kirk]]" prefix followed by a saint's name such as [[Kirkoswald, South Ayrshire|Kirkoswald]]. Interpretation of this is not certain but it is also indicative of a mixed Gaelic/Norse population.<ref name=C100>Crawford (1987) pp. 100</ref>

==Eastern Scotland==
[[File:DunnottarCastle2004.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Dunnottar Castle]]]]
There is no evidence of permanent Viking settlement on the east coast south of the Moray Firth, nor of Norse burials, although raids and even invasions certainly occurred. [[Dunnottar Castle|Dunnottar]] was taken during the reign of [[Donald II of Scotland|Domnall mac Causant<U+00ED>n]].<ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 102<U+2013>03</ref> and the ''Orkneyinga saga'' records an attack on the [[Isle of May]], by [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] and Margad Grimsson:
{{quote|text=They sailed south off Scotland until they came to M<U+00E1>eyar. There was a monastery, the head of which was an abbot, by name, Baldwin. Swein and his men were detained there seven nights by stress of bad weather. They said they had been sent by Earl R<U+00F6>gnvald to the King of Scots. The monks suspected their tale, and thinking they were pirates, sent to the mainland for men. When Swein and his comrades became aware of this, they went hastily aboard their ship, after having plundered much treasure from the monastery.<ref>''Orkneyinga saga'' chapter 83</ref>}}

Place name evidence of Scandinavian settlement is very limited on the east coast and in the south-east [[Old English|Anglian]] was the predominant influence during this period of history.<ref name=C87/><ref name=C100/>

==Internal politics==
The first phase of Norse expansion was that of war bands seeking plunder and the creation of new settlements.  The second phase involved the integration of these settlers into organised political structures of which the most prominent in the early part were the Earls of Orkney in the north<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 63</ref> and the [[U<U+00ED> <U+00CD>mair]] in the south. 

Even if the commencement of a formal earldom of Orkney is a matter of discussion (see above) there  is little doubt that the institution experienced continuity thereafter. Until the mid to late 11th century the Earls of Orkney and Kings of the Western Isles were probably independent rulers.<ref>Imsen (2007) p .13</ref> The imposition of direct Norwegian rule at the end of this century brought this to a close in the north and  unusually, from c. 1100 onwards the Norse ''jarls'' of the Northern Isles owed allegiance both to Norway for Orkney and to the Scottish crown through their holdings as [[Earls of Caithness]].<ref>Crawford, Barbara E. "Orkney in the Middle Ages" in Omand (2003) p. 64.</ref> In 1231 the line of Norse earls, unbroken since Rognvald Eysteinsson, ended with [[Jon Haraldsson]]'s murder in [[Thurso]].<ref>Crawford, Barbara E. "Orkney in the Middle Ages" in Omand (2003) pp. 72<U+2013>73.</ref> The [[Earldom of Caithness]] was granted to [[Magnus II, Earl of Orkney|Magnus]], second son of the [[Earl of Angus]], whom [[Haakon IV of Norway]] confirmed as Earl of Orkney in 1236.<ref>Thomson (2008) pp. 134<U+2013>37.</ref> In 1379 the earldom passed to the [[Clan Sinclair|Sinclair]] family, who were also barons of [[Roslin Castle|Roslin]] near [[Edinburgh]]<ref>Thompson (2008) p. 160.</ref> although Orkney and Shetland remained part of Norway for a century more.

The situation in the Su<U+00F0>reyar was more complex. Different kings may have ruled over very different areas and that few of them can be seen as exerting any kind of close control over this "far-flung sea kingdom".<ref name=W0696>Woolf (2006) p. 96</ref>  The U<U+00ED> <U+00CD>mair were certainly a powerful force from the late 9th to the early 11th century with dynasts such as [[Amla<U+00ED>b Cuar<U+00E1>n]] <ref name=G4-6>Gregory (1881) pp. 4<U+2013>6</ref> and [[Gofraid mac Arailt]]<ref>Downham (2007) p. 185</ref> claiming kingship of the Isles. Norse sources also list various rulers such as ''jarls'' [[Gilli (jarl)|Gilli]], Sigurd the Stout, [[H<U+00E5>kon Eiriksson]]<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 246 </ref> and [[Thorfinn the Mighty]] as rulers over the Hebrides who were vassals of the Kings of Norway or Denmark. The dates from the Irish and Norse sources do not significantly overlap, but it is not clear if these are records of competing empires, or reflect U<U+00ED>  <U+00CD>mar influence in the south and direct Norse rule in the north, or both. Furthermore, two records in the ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'' hint that the Western Isles may not have been "organised into a kingdom or earldom" at this time but rather that they were "ruled by assemblies of freeholders who regularly elected lawmen to preside over their public affairs".<ref name="Woolf 2007 p. 213">Woolf (2007) p. 213</ref> The ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' entries for 962 and 974 hint at a similar arrangement.<ref>Woolf (2007) pp. 298<U+2013>30</ref> Crawford (1987) suggests that influence from the south rather than the north was "usually predominant" whilst admitting that the islands probably formed "groups of more or less independent communities".<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 26</ref>

[[Godred Crovan]] became the ruler of Dublin and Mann from 1079<ref>Gregory (1881) p. 5</ref><ref name=C51>''The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys'' (1874) p. 51</ref> and from the early years of the 12th century the Crovan dynasty asserted themselves and ruled as "Kings of Mann and the Isles" for the next half century.  The kingdom was than sundered due to the actions of [[Somerled]] whose sons inherited the southern Hebrides whilst the Manx rulers held on to the "north isles" for another century.<ref>Sellar (2000) p. 193</ref> The origins of both Godred Crovan and Somerled are obscure<U+2014>  the former may have been an U<U+00ED> <U+00CD>mair dynast from Islay, the latter married a Crovan heiress.<ref>Duffy (1992) p. 106</ref><ref name=G917>Gregory (1881) pp. 9<U+2013>17</ref>

Thus it is clear that although there were competing factions in play, the Hebrides and islands of the Clyde were essentially under the control of rulers of Scandinavian origin from "at least the late tenth century"<ref> Sellar (2000) p. 189</ref> until the emergence of the kingdom of Scotland and its 13th century expansion into the west.

==Relations with Pictland, Strathclyde  and Alba==
[[File:Scotland Dumbarton Castle bordercropped.jpg|thumb|left|Modern [[Dumbarton Castle]], the site of the 9th-century siege by the [[U<U+00ED> <U+00CD>mair]]]]
The early Viking threats may have speeded a long term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians continue to debate whether it was a Pictish takeover of D<U+00E1>l Riata, or the other way around. This culminated in the rise of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|C<U+00ED>naed mac Ailp<U+00ED>n]] in the 840s, who brought to power the [[House of Alpin]] who were leaders of a combined Gaelic-Pictish kingdom for almost two centuries.<ref>Yorke (2006) p. 54.</ref> 

In 870 [[Dumbarton Castle|Dumbarton]] was besieged by Amla<U+00ED>b Conung and [[U<U+00ED> <U+00CD>mair|<U+00CD>mar]], "the two kings of the Northmen", who "returned to Dublin from Britain" the following year with numerous captives.<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 109</ref> Dumbarton was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and this was clearly a major assault which may have brought the whole of mainland Scotland under temporary Ui Imair control.<ref name=OC431/><ref>Woolf (2007) p. 115</ref> Three  years earlier Vikings had seized Northumbria, forming the [[Kingdom of York]]<ref name=R2003p212>Rollason (2003) p. 212</ref> and subsequently conquered much of England except for a reduced kingdom of Wessex,<ref name=R2003p212/> leaving the new combined Pictish and Gaelic kingdom almost encircled.<ref>Hearn (2000) p. 100</ref> Amla<U+00ED>b and his brother Auisle "ravaged the whole of Pictland and took their hostages" and later occupied this territory for a protracted period.<ref><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1998) p. 32, quoting the ''[[Scottish Chronicle]]''.</ref> The 875 [[Battle of Dollar]] was another major setback for the Picts/Scots.

In 902 the Norse suffered a serious reverse in Ireland losing control of [[Dublin]] and this seems to have intensified attacks on the emerging kingdom of [[Alba]]. A year later [[Dunkeld]] was attacked and  <U+00CD>mar, the "grandson of <U+00CD>mar" was killed in battle with the forces of [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]] in mainland Scotland.<ref name=OC431><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (2008) p. 431</ref><ref>Woolf (2007) pp. 130<U+2013>31</ref> In the late tenth century the battle of "Innisibsolian" was won by Alban forces over Vikings. {{#tag:ref|The battle has been identified as possibly taking place near the [[Slate Islands]] of Argyll, although this seems speculative.<ref>Downham (2007) p. 145</ref><ref><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1998) p. 123</ref>|group="Note"}} Yet these events were setbacks for the Norse rather than a definitive moment.

In 962 [[Indulf|Ildulb mac Causant<U+00ED>n]], King of Scots, was killed (according to the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'') fighting the Norse near [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen]], at the [[Battle of Bauds]]<ref>Woolf (2007) pp. 193<U+2013>94</ref> but the line of the [[House of Alpin]] held firm and the threat posed by the Scandinavian presence  to the emergent [[Kingdom of Scotland]] lessened.  Perhaps to counter growing Irish influence in the Western Isles Magnus Barelegs re-established direct Norwegian overlordship there by 1098.<ref>Duffy (1992) pp. 106<U+2013>09</ref><ref><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1998) p. 23</ref> He first took Orkney, the northern Scottish mainland and the Hebrides, where he "dyed his sword red in blood" in the [[Uist]]s.<ref name=H102>Hunter (2000) pp. 102<U+2013>3</ref> In that year, [[Edgar of Scotland]] signed a treaty with Magnus which settled much of the boundary between the Scots and Norwegian claims in the islands.

For example, [[Luing]] and [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore]] were retained by the Scots in the treaty of 1098.<ref>Sellar (2000) p. 191</ref>|group="Note"}} 

Following the intervention of Somerled and his death at the [[Battle of Renfrew]] the Kings of the Isles were weakened relative to the Scottish state, but more than 150 years later Norway intervened again, this time unsuccessfully. Following [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonarson]]'s ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the [[Battle of Largs]] the Hebrides and Mann and all rights that the Norwegian crown "had of old therein" were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 [[Treaty of Perth]].<ref>Hunter (2000) pp. 106<U+2013>111</ref><ref name="Barrett">Barrett (2008) p. 411</ref>

Although there is evidence of varying burial rites practised by Norse settlers in Scotland, such as grave goods found on [[Colonsay]] and [[Westray]], there is little that enables a confirmation that the Norse gods were venerated prior to the reintroduction of Christianity.<ref>Jensen (2007) pp. 52, 58</ref> The [[Standing Stones of Stenness|Odin Stone]] has been used as evidence of [[Odin|Odinic]] beliefs and practices but the derivation may well be from "oathing stone".<ref name=Jen54>Jensen (2007) p. 54</ref>  A few Scandinavian poetic references suggest that Orcadian audiences understood elements of the Norse [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], although this is hardly conclusive proof of active beliefs.<ref>Jensen (2007) pp. 54, 59</ref> Nonetheless, it is likely that pagan practices existed in early Scandinavian Scotland.<ref>Jensen (2007) p. 62</ref> 

According to the sagas, the Northern Isles were Christianised by [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvasson]] in 995 when he stopped at [[South Walls]] on his way from Ireland to Norway.

Once again, the situation in the Hebrides is much less clear. There was a [[Bishop of the Isles|Bishop of Iona]] until the late 10th century and there is then a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first [[Diocese of the Isles|Bishop of Mann]] in 1079.<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 82</ref> The conversion of Scandinavian Scotland and the resultant end to slavery and integration of Viking society into mainstream European culture was a significant event.

Women enjoyed a relatively high status during the Viking Age, possibly due to the high degree of mobility in society. There is little knowledge of their role in the Scandinavian colonies of Scotland although the indirect evidence of graves during the pagan and Christian periods suggests roles similar to those held elsewhere.<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 216</ref> Amongst the best known figures are [[Gormflaith ingen Murchada]], [[Gunnhild, Mother of Kings|Gunnhild Gormsd<U+00F3>ttir]],  [[Aud the Deep-Minded]]<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 217</ref> and  [[Ingibj<U+00F6>rg Hakonsd<U+00F3>ttir|Ingibj<U+00F6>rg]], the daughter of Earl [[Hakon Paulsson]] and wife of  King [[Olaf I Godredsson|Olaf Godredsson]].

The Norse legacy of art and architecture is limited. The Christchurch at Brough of Birsay, now reduced, was the early seat of the Bishop's of Orkney. [[St. Magnus Cathedral]], [[Kirkwall]] is peerless as an example of Norse-era construction in Scotland and St. Magnus Church, on [[Egilsay]] retains its round tower.<ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 253<U+2013>55</ref> The iconic [[Lewis chessmen]] are the best known [[treasure trove]], although numerous other finds of  grave goods such as brooches and weaponry<ref>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref> and other hoards are well-documented.

There is growing evidence  of the importance of trade and commerce. Data from the Outer Hebrides suggests that pigs were a more important aspect of Viking farming than prior to that time, that [[red deer]] numbers may have been controlled rather than the species simply being subject to hunting, that [[herring]] fishing became an important commercial consideration and that trade with centres to the south such as Dublin and [[Bristol]] may have been important. Coins found at Bornais and Cille Pheadair were produced in Norway, [[Westphalia]],  and England, although there were none from Scotland.<ref>Sharples and Smith (2007) pp. 113<U+2013>14, 119</ref> Ivory from [[Greenland]] was also found there.<ref>Sharples and Smith (2007) p. 120</ref>

The Scandinavian influence in Scotland was probably at its height in the mid 11th century<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 221</ref> during the time of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man.<ref>Crawford (1987) p. 79</ref> The ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' have a total land area of approximately {{convert|8374|km2|sqmi|0}}.{{#tag:ref|The land areas of the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' are as follows: the Isle of Man is {{convert|572|km2|sqmi|0}};<ref>[http://www.gov.im/isleofman/geography.xml "Physical Geography"] Isle of Man Government. Retrieved 11 Jan 2011.</ref> the Islands of the Clyde {{convert|574|km2|sqmi|0}};<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 2</ref> the Inner Hebrides {{convert|4158|km2|sqmi|0}};<ref name=GRO>General Register Office for Scotland (28 November 2003) ''[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/census/censushm/occpapers/occasional-paper-10.html Occasional Paper No 10: Statistics for Inhabited Islands]''.

The Viking invasions may have inadvertently played a role in the creation of modern Scotland. Their destructive raids initially weakened Pictland, Strathclyde and Dal Riata, but these "harassed remnants" eventually became a united front and Norse aggression thus played a significant role in the creation of the kingdom of [[Alba]],<ref name="Barrett" /> the nucleus from which the Scottish kingdom expanded as the Viking influence waned, just as in the south the [[Kingdom of Wessex]] expanded to become the kingdom of England.<ref name=Burns48>Burns (2009) p. 48.</ref> 

Some Scots take pride in their Scandinavian ancestry. For example, [[Clan MacLeod]] of Lewis claims its descent from [[Leod]], who according to tradition was a younger son of [[Olaf II of the Isle of Man|Olaf the Black]].<ref>[http://www.clanmacleod.org/about-macleods.html "About MacLeods"]  The Associated Clan MacLeod Societies. Retrieved 16 Oct 2010.</ref> To the contrary, the [[clan MacLean]] being descendants of the rulers of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]], fought against the Vikings gaining autonomy in the first half of the 13th century, eventually allying with the [[Lord of the Isles]] and then with the [[Robert the Bruce]].

Unlike the [[Danelaw]] in England the Scandinavian occupation of Scotland has no single [[WP:COMMON NAME|common name]]. This may be a reflection of the less well documented nature of the various invasions involved, but it also hints at a relative lack of popular understanding of the history. By comparison to the [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman occupations of Scotland]] the Norse kingdoms were much longer lived, more recent and had a significantly more dramatic influence on spoken language and by extension culture and lifestyles generally. They were however confined to areas that are relatively remote from the main centres of modern population. Furthermore, regardless of the actual impact of Scandinavian culture, the hereditary leaders of the Scots nation are generally descended from Pictish, Gaelic and Anglo-Saxon stock. The Vikings are thus often seen in a negative light and as a foreign invasion rather than as a key part of a [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] polity.<ref>Crawford (1987) pp. 221<U+2013>22</ref>

Nonetheless, in the Northern Isles the Scandinavian connection is still celebrated, one of the best-known such events  being the [[Lerwick]] fire-festival [[Up Helly Aa]]. In particular, Shetland's connection with Norway has proven to be enduring. When Norway became independent again in 1906 the Shetland authorities sent a letter to King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]] in which they stated: "Today no 'foreign' flag is more familiar or more welcome in our voes and havens than that of Norway, and Shetlanders continue to look upon Norway as their mother-land, and recall with pride and affection the time when their forefathers were under the rule of the Kings of Norway."<ref name=Sch13>Schei (2006) p. 13</ref>
