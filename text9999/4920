'''''Williams v. Lee''''', [[Case citation|358 U.S. 217]] (1959), was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark case]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that the state of Arizona does not have jurisdiction to try a civil case between a non-Indian doing business on a reservation with tribal members who reside on the reservation, the proper forum for such a case is the tribal court.<ref name=SCOTUS>Williams v. Lee, {{ussc|358|217|1959}}.</ref>

==Background==
Paul Williams and his wife Lorena were enrolled tribal members of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribe, and resided on the [[Navajo nation|Navajo reservation]] in [[Arizona]].  Hugh Lee was an [[Indian Trade|Indian trader]] who operated a [[trading post]] on the reservation.  Lee was licensed by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) to operate the trading post and he sold goods on credit to members of the tribe.  Williams bought goods on credit and did not make payment.  In 1952, Lee filed a [[lawsuit]]<ref name=Ball>{{smallcaps|Dewi Ioan Ball}},  (2010), ''[http://www.msulawreview.org/PDFS/2010-2/Ball.pdf William v. Lee - 50 Years Later: A Reassessment of One of the Most Important Cases in the Modern-Era of Federal Indian Law]'' {{smallcaps|2010 Mich. State L. Rev. 391}} (2010).</ref> in the [[Arizona Superior Courts|Superior Court]] of [[Apache County, Arizona]] and obtained a [[writ of attachment]] for sheep belonging to Williams.{{#tag:ref|Sheep were the primary livelihood for Williams and for most members of the Navajo tribe<ref name=Berger>{{smallcaps|Bethany R. Berger}}, ''[http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/109/8/Berger.pdf Williams v. Lee and the Debate over Indian Equality]'', {{smallcaps|109 Mich. L. Rev. 1463}} (2009).</ref>|group=fn}}<ref name=Berger />  Williams moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the state court did not have jurisdiction on the reservation.  In the meantime, Lee was granted an order authorizing the [[Apache County Sheriff's Office|Apache County Sheriff]] to sell at auction the sheep belonging to Williams.  In 1954 the trial court finally issued a ruling denying the motion to dismiss and in 1955, found for Lee.<ref name=Berger />  Williams appealed to the [[Arizona Supreme Court]].<ref name=ASC>Williams et ux. v. Lee, [http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=195832483Ariz241_1275.xml&docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985 319 P.2d 998] (Ariz. 1958).</ref>

At the Arizona Supreme Court, Williams argued that the proper jurisdiction was the [[Navajo Nation#Judiciary|Navajo tribal court]] and that a state officer did not have the authority to sell the sheep.  The Arizona Supreme Court held that the state did have jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] and non-Indians, since there was no [[United States Congress|Congressional]] prohibition against it.  The court did rule, however, that federal regulations prohibited the sale of Indian livestock without the approval of BIA.<ref name=ASC />  Williams then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case and issued a writ of ''[[certiorari]]''.<ref name=SCOTUS /><ref name=Ball />

==Opinion of the court==
[[File:HugoLaFayetteBlack.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Justice Hugo Black portrait|Justice Hugo Black, author of the unanimous opinion]]

===Arguments===
Norman M. Littell{{#tag:ref|Littell was the attorney for the Navajo tribe, who funded the appeal to the Supreme Court.  The tribe was concerned that if the Arizona Supreme Court decision stood, that state would undermine the authority of the tribe to govern itself.<ref name=Ball /><ref name=Berger />|group=fn}} argued the case for Williams.  Littell argued that Congress had [[plenary power]] to end tribal immunity but had not done so, and that other federal laws preempted state jurisdiction.<ref name=Berger />  William W. Stevenson argued the case for Lee.  He argued that the Navajo tribe was a creation of the federal government, and not a long-standing tribe like the Cherokee.  His position was that there was no tribal sovereignty.<ref name=Berger />  [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[J. Lee Rankin]] filed an ''[[amicus curae]]'' brief at the request of the court, urging reversal.<ref name=SCOTUS />  While Rankin supported reversal, he did so on narrow grounds, based on federal regulations of Indian traders.<ref name=Ball /><ref name=Berger />

===Unanimous opinion===
[[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[Hugo Black]] delivered the opinion of a unanimous court.  Black noted that in 1830, the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] had tried to extend its laws to the [[Cherokee]] reservation and that ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''<ref name=Worcester>[[Worcester v. Georgia]], {{ussc|31|515|1832|Pet.|6}}.</ref> clearly established that state law and jurisprudence did not reach into the confines of a reservation.{{#tag:ref|Black quoted [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]], who stated "The Cherokee nation . . . is a distinct community, occupying its own territory . . . in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter, but with the assent of the Cherokees themselves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of congress. The whole intercourse between the United States and this nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States."<ref name=SCOTUS /><ref name=Worcester />|group=fn}}<ref name=Ball />  He then stated that the question was whether, absent Congressional authorization, a state infringed on the right of the tribe to govern itself.<ref name=Clinton>{{smallcaps|Robert N. Clinton}}, ''[http://robert-clinton.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/scholarship/26%20S.Dak.%20L.%20Rev.%20434-46.pdf State Power over Indian Reservations: A Critical Comment on Burger Court Doctrine]'', {{smallcaps|26 S.Dak.

Georgia'' had denied."<ref name=SCOTUS />  Finally, he noted that the Navajo tribal court has jurisdiction to hear civil cases brought by non-Indians against tribal members and that no federal statute has given Arizona jurisdiction to hear such cases.{{#tag:ref|Black did note that [[Public Law 280]] would grant Arizona such authority, but that Arizona has not moved to accept such jurisdiction.<ref name=SCOTUS /><ref name=Ball />|group=fn}}<ref name=SCOTUS /><ref name=Ball /><ref name=Clinton /><ref name=Wilkinson>{{smallcaps|Charles F. Wilkinson}}, {{smallcaps|American Indians, Time, and the Law: Native Societies in a Modern Constitutional Democracy}} 1-3, 106 (1988).</ref>

Black stated that allowing the exercise of state jurisdiction would undermine [[tribal sovereignty]] and that only Congress had the authority to do so.<ref name=Ball /><ref name=Clinton /><ref name=Iverson>{{smallcaps|Peter Iverson & Monty Roessel}}, {{smallcaps|Din<U+00E9>: A History of the Navajos}} 209-210 (2002).</ref>  The case was reversed.<ref name=SCOTUS />
