'''U.S. Route 206''' ('''US 206''') is a {{convert|130.23|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long north&ndash;south [[United States highway]] in [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. Only about a half a mile (800 m) of its length is in Pennsylvania; the [[Milford-Montague Toll Bridge]] carries it over the [[Delaware River]] into New Jersey, where it is the remainder of the route. The highway's northern terminus is near [[Milford, Pennsylvania]] at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 209 (Pennsylvania)|US 209]]; some sources and signs show an [[concurrency (road)|overlap]] with US 209 to end at its parent route [[U.S. 6 (Pennsylvania)|US 6]]. Its southern terminus is in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]] at an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 54|Route 54]] and [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|US 30]].  For much of its length, US 206 is a rural two-lane undivided road that passes through the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]], agricultural areas, and the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of northwestern New Jersey, with some urban and suburban areas. The route connects several cities and towns, including [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], [[Netcong, New Jersey|Netcong]], and [[Newton, New Jersey|Newton]]. The road is known as the '''Disabled American Veterans Highway''' for much of its length.
 
What is now US 206 in New Jersey was designated as part of several state routes prior to 1927, including [[Pre-1927 Route 2 (New Jersey)|Pre-1927 Route 2]] between Bordentown and Trenton in 1916, [[Pre-1927 Route 13 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 13]] between Trenton and Princeton in 1917, and [[Pre-1927 Route 16 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 16]] between Princeton and [[Bedminster Township, New Jersey|Bedminster Township]] in 1921. The current routing along pre-1927 Route 2 became a part of [[U.S. Route 130|US 130]] in 1926. In 1927, current US 206 became [[New Jersey Route 39|Route 39]] between Hammonton and [[White Horse, New Jersey|White Horse]], [[New Jersey Route 37|Route 37]] between White Horse and Trenton, [[New Jersey Route 27|Route 27]] between Trenton and Princeton, '''Route 31''' between Princeton and Newton, and '''Route S31''' between Newton and the Delaware River. In the later 1930s, US 206 was designated to connect US 30 in Hammonton north to US 6 and US 209 in Milford; the northern terminus was moved to its current location in the 1940s. The state highways running concurrent with US 206 in New Jersey were removed in 1953. In the 1960s, two separate [[freeway]]s were proposed for US 206 but never built. The first freeway was to connect Hammonton south along the Route 54 corridor toward [[New Jersey Route 55|Route 55]] and the planned [[New Jersey Route 60|Route 60]] in [[Vineland, New Jersey|Vineland]] and [[Millville, New Jersey|Millville]]. The other US 206 freeway was planned in northwestern New Jersey, connecting [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] in Netcong north to [[Montague Township, New Jersey|Montague Township]]. Construction has begun for a bypass of US 206 around [[Hillsborough, New Jersey|Hillsborough]] in 2010 after being planned since 1974. The NJDOT is currently widening the route in [[Byram Township, New Jersey|Byram Township]] to alleviate congestion, with completion expected in 2011.

From Trenton north to Princeton, pre-1927 Route 13 was replaced by Route 27. Present-day US 206 between Princeton and Newton became part of Route 31, a route that was to go past Newton to the New York border near [[Unionville, Orange County, New York|Unionville]], while the portion north of Newton to the Delaware River in Montague became Route S31, a spur of Route 31.<ref name=nj1927>State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319.</ref><ref name="Map">{{cite map|title=1927 New Jersey Road Map|publisher= 1920s New Jersey Highways}}</ref> Another spur of Route 31, [[New Jersey Route 31A|Route 31A]], was legislated in 1941 to run from Route 31 in Princeton to [[New Jersey Route 33|Route 33]] in [[Hightstown, New Jersey|Hightstown]]; only a small portion of this was built over the Northeast Corridor railroad line and is now [[New Jersey Route 64|Route 64]].<ref name=nj1941>State of New Jersey, Laws of 1941, Chapter 105.</ref><ref name="nj1953"/><ref name=nyt/>

US 206 is currently being widened in Byram Township to six lanes, with completion expected in 2011. This construction follows a decade of controversy, including concerns that the widening would violate the [[Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act]] passed in 2004; an exemption to this act allowed the construction to proceed. The widening is being done in order to eliminate backups on the current two-lane stretch during rush hours.<ref name=dr>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-12-14|title=Route 206 widening finally under way |publisher=''[[Daily Record (Morristown)|Daily Record]]''|date=December 7, 2009|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20091207/COLUMNISTS21/91204122/1099/COLUMNISTS }}</ref>
