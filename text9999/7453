'''John, Dauphin of France and Duke of Touraine''' (31 August 1398 &ndash; 5 April 1417) was the fourth son and ninth child of [[Charles VI of France]] and [[Isabeau of Bavaria]]. He was born in Paris.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} After his three elder brothers died, he became [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] in 1415. In 1406 he married [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut|Jacqueline]], heiress of the [[Count of Hainaut|County of Hainaut]], [[Count of Holland|Holland]], [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], and [[Frisia]].
After his marriage to Jacqueline, he was brought up at the castle of [[Le Quesnoy]] in Hainaut, at the court of his mother-in-law, [[Margaret of Burgundy, Duchess of Bavaria|Margaret of Burgundy]]. This arrangement was made between his father and his father-in-law to ensure his safety away from the tulmultous court in Paris, as well as to acquaint him with the lands which he would rule as husband of Jacqueline after her father's death.<ref>A. Janse, ''Een Pion voor een Dame'' (2009)</ref>
After the death of his elder brother [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|Louis]] in December 1415, he became the next Dauphin of France.

He died on 5 April 1417 at the age of eighteen. What exactly caused his death is disputed. According to some, he died of the consequences of an abscess to the head, while other sources suggest he had been poisoned.<ref>Ernest van Bruyssel, [http://books.google.fr/books?id=KEEaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66 ''Histoire du commerce et de la marine en Belgique''], 1863, p. 66., A. Janse, ''Een Pion voor een Dame'' (2009)</ref> He was buried in [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]]'s Saint-Corneille abbey. His younger brother [[Charles VII of France|Charles]] became dauphin and eventually king.
