'''Nancy Campbell Cartwright''' (born October 25, 1957) is an American [[film]] and [[television]] [[actor|actress]], [[comedienne]] and [[Voice acting|voice artist]]. Noted for her long-running role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', she also voices other characters for the show, including [[Nelson Muntz]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Flanders family#Todd|Todd Flanders]], [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]] and [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Database|Database]]. 

Born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], Cartwright moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained as a voice actress alongside [[Daws Butler]]. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', which she followed up with a starring role in the television movie ''Marian Rose White'' and her first feature film in ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' in 1983.

Cartwright continued to audition for voice-over and live-action roles, and in 1987, she decided to audition for a role in a series of animated [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] about a [[Simpson family|dysfunctional family]] on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the eldest daughter; however, when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be much more interesting. [[Matt Groening]], creator of the shorts, allowed her to audition for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing her read. For her work as Bart, Cartwright would receive a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.

==Early life==

She regularly entered public speaking competitions, placing first in the "Humorous Interpretation" category at the National District Tournament for two years in a row, where the judges often suggested to her that she should do cartoon voices. She graduated from high school in 1976 and received a scholarship from [[Ohio University]], which she accepted.<ref>Cartwright, pp. 9&ndash;10.</ref> There she continued to compete in public speaking competitions; during her sophomore year, she competed in the National Speech Tournament and placed fifth in the exposition category with her speech "The Art of Animation".<ref>Cartwright, pp. 15&ndash;16.</ref> 

Cartwright got a part-time job doing voice-overs for commercials at [[WING]] radio station in Dayton in 1977.<ref name=Cincinatti>{{Cite web|title=Bart Simpson's secrets revealed |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/12/18/tem_kiesewetter_bart.html|author=Kieswetter, John|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=2000, 12-18|accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref> In the second quarter of the same year, a representative of [[Warner Bros. Records]] visited WING and agreed to send Cartwright a list of contacts in the animation industry.<ref>Cartwright, pp. 12&ndash;13.</ref> One of the contacts was [[Daws Butler]], who voiced characters such as [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Snagglepuss]], [[The Jetsons|Elroy Jetson]] and [[Yogi Bear]]. Cartwright decided to try to call him, and left a message on his answering machine in which she used a cockney accent.<ref name="Eat my shorts"/> Butler immediately called her back and agreed to mentor her on voice acting. He sent her a script in the mail, instructing her to make a tape recording of herself reading it and to send it back to him. He would then critique it and send her notes. Butler continued to train her in this method for the next year, sending her a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as "absolutely amazing, always encouraging, [and] always polite."<ref>Cartwright, p. 14.</ref>

Cartwright returned to Ohio University for her sophomore year, but decided to transfer to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) in the following years so she could be closer to Hollywood and to work with Butler.<ref name=Cincinatti/> Miriam Cartwright died late in the summer of 1978, two weeks before Nancy was going to move to California.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Just don't call me Bart|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|date=2000-11-19}}</ref> She nearly changed her relocation plans but, on September 17, 1978, Cartwright "joylessly" flew to [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, California]].<ref>Cartwright, pp. 16&ndash;18.</ref>

While attending UCLA, which did not have a public speaking team,<ref>Cartwright, p. 19.</ref> Cartwright continued to train as a voice actress with Butler. She recalled, "every Sunday I<U+2019>d take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours [...] They had four sons, they didn<U+2019>t have a daughter and I kind of fitted <nowiki>[</nowiki>''[[sic]]''<nowiki>]</nowiki> in as the baby of the family."<ref name="Edinburgh">{{Cite web|url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/thesimpsons/And-speaking-of-the-Simpsons.2554090.jp|title=And speaking of the Simpsons|date=2004-08-12|work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> Butler introduced her to many of the voice actors and directors at [[Hanna-Barbera]]. One of the directors was [[Gordon Hunt (director)|Gordon Hunt]], who later asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]''. She got the part, and would later work with Hunt on several different projects. In the third quarter of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a role as a lead character in a pilot for a sitcom called ''In Trouble''. Cartwright described ''In Trouble'' as "forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career."<ref name=p25>Cartwright, pp. 23&ndash;25.</ref> She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12253984|title=Cartwright: It's Bearable Being Bart's Likeness|accessdate=2007-07-26|author=Terry Gross Interview on "Fresh Air" (Interview confirms transfer to UCLA)|date=2007-07-26|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}</ref> During the summer, Cartwright worked with [[Jonathan Winters]] as part of an improvisation troupe for several shows at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]].<ref name=p25/> 

Returning to [[Los Angeles]], Cartwright got the lead role in the television movie ''Marian Rose White''. [[Janet Maslin]], a critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Cartwright as "a chubby, lumbering, slightly [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] actress whose naturalness adds greatly to the film's impact;"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1D81138F93AA25752C0A964948260|title=TV: 'Marian Rose White' in a mental institution|author=Maslin, Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1982-01-19|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> in response, Cartwright sent Maslin a letter insisting she was not cross-eyed and included a photograph.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bart is a good girl at heart; the mischievous little boy, who brings his iconoclastic status to the big screen, is really a middle aged woman|work=[[Guelph Mercury]]|date=2007-07-26|author=New York Times News Service}}</ref> Cartwright then auditioned for a role as Ethel in ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', and met with director [[Joe Dante]]. She described Dante as "a total cartoon buff, and once he took a look at my resume and noticed Daws Butler's name on it, we were off and running, sharing anecdotes about Daws and animation.

In 1985, she auditioned for a guest spot as Cynthia in ''[[Cheers]]''. In the audition, she was supposed to say her line and walk out the door. Cartwright did this, but continued walking, leaving the building and eventually receiving the part.<ref name=p29/> Wanting more training, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach [[Milton Katselas]]. Katselas recommended that Cartwright study ''[[La strada]]'', a 1956 Italian film starring [[Giulietta Masina]] and directed by [[Federico Fellini]]. She began performing "every imaginable scene" from ''La Strada'' in her class and decided to try to get the rights to produce a stage adaptation of the film. For several months she unsuccessfully tried to secure the rights the film. She decided to visit Italy so she could meet and try to get the rights from Fellini in person. Although she never did meet him, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one woman play called ''In Search of Fellini'' that was partially based on experiences in Italy.<ref>Cartwright, pp. 30&ndash;33.</ref> The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and she won a [[Drama-Logue Award]] after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995.

===''The Simpsons''===
[[File:AndreaCartwright07.jpg|thumb|right|Cartwright in October 2007]]
Cartwright became most famous for her role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the long-running animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', a live-action [[variety show]]. The show featured shorts as bumpers, and aired between sketches. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the eldest daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever".<ref>Cartwright, pp. 35<U+2013>40</ref> Creator [[Matt Groening]] let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm|title=Bart's voice tells all|accessdate=2009-02-05|date=2000-11-10|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Bart's voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', she had used elements of it in ''My Little Pony'', ''Snorks'', and ''Pound Puppies''.<ref name="My Boy"/> Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared to other characters."<ref name="My Boy"/> The recording of the shorts was often primitive, the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on ''The Tracey Ullman show'' set. Cartwright described the sessions as "great fun", but she also wanted to appear on the live-action portion of the show. She occasionally showed up for recording sessions early in hopes of being noticed by a producer and used in a sketch.<ref>Cartwright, pp. 43&ndash;50.</ref> 

In 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] called ''The Simpsons''. Bart quickly became the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]] and one of the most popular characters on television; the character's increasing popularity in 1990 and 1991 was termed "Bartmania".<ref name=p120>[[#Turner|Turner]], pp. 120<U+2013>121</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon leads a revolt against apple-pie family&nbsp;<U+2014> Simpsons|accessdate=2009-02-07|date=1990-07-08|author=Cassidy, John|work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22062437-5009160,00.html|title=Simpsons set for big screen|accessdate=2009-02-07|date=2007-07-15|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D71F3AF93AA15757C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=4|title=Cashing in on a Hot New Brand Name |author=Kleinfield, N.R.|accessdate=2009-02-07|date=1990-04-29|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Bart was described as "television's brightest new star" by Mike Boone of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Bart Simpson was ray of hope in a year of generally drab television |accessdate=2009-02-07|date=1990-12-30|author=Boone, Mike|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]}}</ref> and was named "entertainer of the year" by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318928,00.html|title=1.
