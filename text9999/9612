This article contains a '''list of Encyclicals of Pope John Paul II'''.  [[Pope John Paul II]] issued 14 Papal [[Encyclical]]s during his reign as [[Pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for over 26 years, from his election on [[16 October]] [[1978]] until his death on [[2 April]] [[2005]].</onlyinclude>

An encyclical (from [[Latin]] ''encyclia'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "en kyklo, {{Polytonic|<U+1F10><U+03BD> <U+03BA><U+03CD><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+1FF3>}}", meaning "general" or "encircling") was a [[Flyer (pamphlet)|circular]] letter sent to all the churches of a particular area in the ancient Christian church.  For the modern Roman Catholic Church, a Papal Encyclical, in the strictest sense, is a letter sent by the Pope which is explicitly addressed to Roman Catholic [[bishop]]s of a particular area or to the world, usually treating some aspect of Catholic [[doctrine]].  A Papal Encyclical is generally used for significant issues, and is second in importance only to the highest ranking document now issued by popes, an [[Apostolic Constitution]]. 

The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its [[incipit|first few words]].
