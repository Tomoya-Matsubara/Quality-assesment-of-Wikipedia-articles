==Early life==
Tyson was born as the second of three children in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, and was raised in [[the Bronx]].<ref name="birthplace" /> His mother, Sunchita Feliciano Tyson, was a [[gerontologist]], and his father, Cyril deGrasse Tyson, was a [[sociologist]], human resource commissioner for the New York City mayor [[John Lindsay]], and the first Director of [[Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited]].<ref>Whitaker, Charles (August 2000).

Accessed September 4, 2009.</ref> Tyson attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] (1972<U+2013>1976, [[astrophysics]] emphasis) where he was captain of the wrestling team, and [[editor-in-chief]] of the school's ''Physical Science Journal''. Tyson had an abiding interest in [[astronomy]] since he was nine years old, following his visit to the Hayden Planetarium. He obsessively studied astronomy in his teens, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson <U+2013> The Prodigy Astronomer |publisher=Parlemagazine.com |date=1958-10-05 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> Tyson recalls that "so strong was that imprint [of the night sky] that I'm certain that I had no choice in the matter, that in fact, the universe called me."<ref>{{cite video|title=Stephen Colbert Interviews Neil deGrasse Tyson|date=January 29th, 2010|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=YXh9RQCvxmg#t=1597s|work=interview}}</ref>

Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who was a faculty member at [[Cornell University]], tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies.<ref>{{cite news

Somehow the admissions office brought my application to the attention of the late Dr. Sagan, and he actually took the initiative and care to contact me. He was very inspirational and a most powerful influence. Dr. Sagan was as great as the universe, an effective mentor." Tyson chose to attend [[Harvard University]], however, where he majored in [[physics]] and lived in [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]]. He was a member of the [[Sport rowing|crew]] team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, eventually [[Letterman (sports)|lettering]] in his senior year. In addition to wrestling and rowing in college, he was active in dance, in styles including [[Jazz dance|jazz]], [[ballet]], [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]], and [[List of dance style categories#International Latin|Latin Ballroom]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Tyson earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in physics from Harvard in 1980 and began his graduate work at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he earned a [[Master of Arts]] in astronomy in 1983. In 1985, he won a gold medal with the University of Texas dance team at a national tournament in the International Latin Ballroom style. Tyson transferred from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] to [[Columbia University]] in 1988 after his committee was dissolved.<ref>{{cite video|date=December 12, 2008|title=Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I5Fl1Qn-Do|accessdate=May 1, 2010|time=45:43}}</ref> At Columbia University, he earned a [[Master of Philosophy]] in astrophysics in 1989, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in astrophysics in 1991.

==Career==
[[File:Tyson & students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution|evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]] and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and Hayden Planetarium.

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for the magazine in 2002, Tyson coined the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the cross streets of the street grid in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257|title=Neil deGrasse Tyson|work=The Great Courses|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref>

In 2001, US President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Tyson to serve on the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]] and in 2004 to serve on the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.<ref Name="PSM">{{cite web| title= Symposium Awards|publisher=National Space Symposium|accessdate=October 25, 2010| url= http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/about/awards/douglas-s-morrow-public-outreach-award}}</ref>

In 2004, he hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of PBS's ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/|title=NOVA <U+2013> Origins |year= 2004| work= [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS)|author=WGBH Educational Foundation|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref> and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald|last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

[[File:Tyson & Kepler team.jpg|thumb|left|Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'']]
As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''The Colbert Report'', ''The Daily Show'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.<ref>''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006</ref> In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification. Daniel Simone wrote of the interview with Tyson describing his frustration. "For a while, we were not very popular here at the Hayden Planetarium."

Tyson recounted the heated on-line debate on the [[CCNet (network)|Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group" following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.<ref name=TysonPluto2008>

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]''  until 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/|title=NOVA <U+2013> scienceNOW <U+2013> PBS|work=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS)|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref> He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium on November 2006. In 2007, Tyson, who is known for his vibrant character, cheerful demeanor, and awe of the vastness of the universe itself, was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.

In May 2009, he launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''StarTalk'', which he co-hosted with comedienne [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KTLK (AM)|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and Leighann Lord instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[Gza]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is also available via the internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://startalkradio.net/|title=StarTalk Radio Show|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.<ref>{{citation

Tyson lived near the [[World Trade Center]] and was an eyewitness to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. He wrote a widely circulated letter on what he saw.<ref>[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2001/09/12/the-horror-the-horror "The Horror, The Horror"] from Tyson's website</ref> Footage he filmed on the day was included in the 2008 documentary film ''[[102 Minutes That Changed America]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1312203/combined IMDB: 102 Minutes That Changed America (2008)(TV)]</ref><ref>[[102 Minutes That Changed America]] (2008)(TV) - Credits</ref>

On June 6, 2008, after the conclusion of the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic presidential primaries]], Tyson wrote an op-ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in which he presented a statistical analysis of then recent polling data. From this analysis, Tyson concluded that in a hypothetical election held on the day of the publication of his article, [[Barack Obama]] would lose to [[John McCain]], whereas [[Hillary Clinton]] would beat McCain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/opinion/06tyson.html|title=Vote by Numbers|work=The New York Times|author=Neil deGrasse Tyson|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref>

Tyson collaborated with the organization, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), on a [[public service announcement]] that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Interview With PETA|url=http://www.peta.org/features/Dr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> He also granted PETA an interview, in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be [[Empathy|empathetic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Exclusive PETA Interview|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6hj6xLE8w&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ffeatures%2FDr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx&feature=player_embedded|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref>

Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing,"<ref name="buffalo2010">{{cite web|title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o|publisher=University at Buffalo Communications|accessdate=30 Nov 2012|date=2 April 2010}}</ref> Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."<ref name="buffalo2010" />

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that "Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar.
