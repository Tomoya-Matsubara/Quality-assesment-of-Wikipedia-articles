==Biography==

{{quote|... I went to &#91;[[Middlesex Hospital]]&#93; [[Medical School]], started on the first part of a medical training, jacked it in and went on to do a degree in English at [[Oxford University]]. I then worked for the BBC until they chucked me out and I have been a freelance writer, broadcaster, lecturer, performer ever since <U+2013> that's to say since 1972. Most of my books have been for children, but that's not how I started out. ...

Sometime around the age of twelve and thirteen I began to get a sense that I liked writing, liked trying out different kinds of writing, I tried writing satirical poems about people I knew.<ref name=WriteWords/>}}

===Early career===
After his studies at [[Wadham College, Oxford]], and graduation in 1969, Rosen became a graduate trainee at the BBC. Among the work that he did while there in the 1970s was presenting a series on BBC Schools television called ''WALRUS'' ('''W'''rite '''A'''nd '''L'''earn, '''R'''ead, '''U'''nderstand, '''S'''peak). He was also scriptwriter on the children's reading series ''[[Sam on Boffs' Island]]''. But Rosen found working for the corporation frustrating: "Their view of 'educational' was narrow. The machine had decided this was the direction to take. Your own creativity was down the spout."<ref name=Styles>{{citation|author=Morag Styles|title=Authorgraph No 51 <U+2013> Michael Rosen|url=http://www.booksforkeeps.co.uk/issues/51/27198|journal=Books for Keeps: the Children's Book Magazine|date=July 1988|issue=51|accessdate=2008-08-21}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}.</ref>

Despite previously having made no secret of his radical [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] politics when he was originally interviewed for a BBC post, he was asked to go freelance in 1972, though in practice he was sacked despite several departments of the BBC wishing to employ him. In common with the China expert and journalist [[Isabel Hilton]] among several others at this time, Rosen had failed the vetting procedures which were then in operation. This long-standing practice was only revealed in 1985.<ref>{{citation|author=Mark Hollingsworth|author2=Richard Norton-Taylor|chapter=MI5 and the BBC <U+2013> Stamping the 'Christmas Tree' files &#91;chap. 5&#93;|chapterurl=http://bilderberg.org/mi5bbc.htm|title=Blacklist: The Inside Story of Political Vetting|location=London|publisher=Hogarth Press|year=1988|page=104|isbn=0-7012-0811-2 (pbk.)}}; David Leigh and Paul Lashmar [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/mi5.bbc.page9_obs_18aug1985.html "The Blacklist in Room 105"], ''The Observer'', 18 August 1985, p.9</ref>

In 1974 ''Mind Your Own Business'', his first book of poetry for children, was published. In due course, Rosen established himself with his collections of humorous verse for children, including ''Wouldn't You Like to Know'', ''You Tell Me'' and ''Quick Let's Get Out of Here''.

Educationalist Morag Styles has described Rosen as "one of the most significant figures in contemporary children's poetry". He was, says Styles, one of the first poets "to draw closely on his own childhood experiences ... and to 'tell it as it was' in the ordinary language children actually use".<ref name=Styles/>

Rosen played a key role in opening up children's access to poetry: both through his own writing and with important anthologies such as ''Culture Shock''. He was one of the first poets to make visits to schools throughout the UK and further afield in Australia, Canada and Singapore.<ref name=Styles/> His tours continue to enthuse and engage school children about poetry in the present.<ref>See, for example, {{citation|title=Michael Rosen tour highlights|url=http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/podcasts/video/michael-rosen-tour-highlights|publisher=Scottish Book Trust|accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref>

===Since 1990===
In 1993, he gained an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in Children's Literature from the [[University of Reading]]; he also holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of North London]].<ref>{{citation|author=Nicholas Tucker|title=Interview: Why Michael Rosen will relish being the Children's Laureate|url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/features/article2783654.ece|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=20 July 2007}}</ref> 

He is well established as a broadcaster, presenting a range of documentary features on British radio. He is the presenter of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s regular magazine programme ''[[Word of Mouth (radio programme)|Word of Mouth]]'' which looks at the English language and the way it is used.<ref>{{citation|title=Word of Mouth|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/wordofmouth.shtml|publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]]|accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref>

The English Association gave ''[[Sad Book|Michael Rosen's Sad Book]]'' an Exceptional Award for the Best Children's Illustrated Books of 2004, in the 4<U+2013>11 age range. The book was written by Michael Rosen and illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]]. It deals in part with bereavement, and followed the publication of ''Carrying the Elephant: A Memoir of Love and Loss'' which was published in November 2002 after the death of his son Eddie, who features as a child in much of his earlier poetry. In 2004 Rosen published ''This Is Not My Nose: A Memoir of Illness and Recovery'', an account of his ten years with undiagnosed [[hypothyroidism]]; a course of drugs in 1981 alleviated the condition.<ref name=Styles/>

Rosen has been involved in campaigning around issues of education and for the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cause. He has written columns for the ''[[Socialist Worker]]'' newspaper<ref>{{cite web | last=Rosen | first=Michael | title=Michael Rosen: <U+2018>Question Time has opened the door for the BNP<U+2019> | work= | publisher=Socialist Worker | date=27 October 2009 | url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=19404 | doi= | accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref> and spoken at conferences organised by the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]].<ref>{{cite web | last= | first= | title=Ideas to change the world<U+2026> Marxism 2010 | publisher=Socialist Workers Party | date= | url=http://www.swp.org.uk/party-notes | doi= | accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref> He stood for election in June 2004 in London as a [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]] candidate.<ref name=Alberta/> He is a supporter of the [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.uk/supporters/index.php |title=Our Supporters |publisher=Republic |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref>

In August 2010 Rosen contributed to an eBook collection of political poems entitled ''Emergency Verse - Poetry in Defence of the Welfare State'' edited by [[Alan Morrison (poet)|Alan Morrison]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therecusant.org.uk |title=Welcome |publisher=The Recusant |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref>

In 2011 he collaborated with his wife, Emma-Louise Williams, to produce the film 'Under the Cranes',<ref>{{cite web|author=Under the Cranes |url=http://underthecranes.blogspot.com |title=Under the Cranes |publisher=Underthecranes.blogspot.com |date=2012-11-23 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref> with Rosen providing the original screenplay (a 'play for voices' called 'Hackney Streets') which Williams took as a basis with which to direct the film. It premiered at the Rio Cinema, Dalston, London on 30 April 2011 as part of the East End Film Festival.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/newsandviews/festivals/east-end-film-festival-2011.php | title=East London on film, East End Film Festival | publisher=BFI | date=May 2011 | accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

From September 2014 he will take up a new role at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] as a Professor in the Department of Education Studies responsible for developing courses in children's literature.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/news/pressrelease/?releaseID=1040 | title=Award-winning children's author joins Goldsmiths | publisher=Goldsmiths |date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref>
