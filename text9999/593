'''Knut Arild Hareide''' (born [[November 23]] [[1972]] in [[Rubbestadneset]]) is a Norwegian businessperson and politician for the [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian Democratic Party]]. He is best known as a former Minister of the Environment, serving from 2004 to 2005. Hareide received his share of criticism during this time; environmental press groups spoke out against him on numerous occasions, and even pressed legal charges following a controversial case. Before his tenure as government minister, Hareide had sat through one term in the municipal council of his native [[B<U+00F8>mlo]], served as a deputy representative to the national parliament as well as working two years as a [[State Secretary#Norway|State Secretary]]. He was also second deputy leader of his party from 2003 to 2007, having come through the ranks of the party's youth organization. An economist by education, Hareide currently works for the media conglomerate [[Schibsted]], having stepped down from the national political scene for the time being.

==Education==
Hareide started his higher education in 1992, the same year he graduated from upper secondary school. Enrolled at the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]] (NHH), he graduated in 1997 with a ''[[sivil<U+00F8>konom]]'' degree. During his time at NHH, he also minored in [[sociology]] (1995) at the [[University of Bergen]].

Hareide was active in student politics. His involvement included terms as a member of the [[Students' union|student parliament]] at the University of Bergen, as the leader of the [[Student Union of the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]] 1994&ndash;1995, and as a board member of the national student union 1993&ndash;1994. During the period in student politics, Hareide held a [[Christian democratic]] middle ground between radical (such as later socialist politician [[Aslak Sira Myhre]]) and conservative representatives, an experience he has described as educational.<ref>{{cite news |first=<U+00D8>yvind Lefdal |last=Eidsvik |title=Utstudert: Knut Arild Hareide |url=http://www.studvest.no/kultur.php?art_id=2064 |work=Studvest |date=[[9 February]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>

==Career==
Hareide was active in the [[Youth of the Christian People's Party]], being a member of the national board 1999<U+2013>2001 before joining the national board of the Christian Democratic Party. He worked as a political advisor in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education|Ministry of Church Affairs, Education and Research]] from 1998 to 2000, during the [[first cabinet Bondevik]]. He later became [[State Secretary#Norway|State Secretary]] in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Finance|Ministry of Finance]] from 2001 to 2003 during the [[second cabinet Bondevik]]. In 2003 he became second deputy leader of the Christian Democratic Party nationwide.

He then joined the cabinet during a 2004 reshuffle, serving as the [[Minister of the Environment (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of the Environment]] from summer 2004 to fall 2005. He was the youngest ever cabinet member from the Christian Democratic Party,<ref name="leftpolitics">{{cite news |first=Berit |last=Almendingen |title=Derfor g<U+00E5>r han av |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/politikk/article991751.ece |work=Nettavisen |date=[[27 April]] [[2004]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> and the first Christian Democratic to hold the post. The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 elections]], and as such Hareide had to step down from office that year. His successor was [[Helen Bj<U+00F8>rn<U+00F8>y]]. Hareide has never been elected to the [[Stortinget|Norwegian Parliament]], but has served as a deputy representative during the terms 1997&ndash;2001, 2001&ndash;2005 and 2005&ndash;2009. On the local level of politics he was a member of B<U+00F8>mlo [[municipal council (Norway)|municipality council]] from 1991 to 1995.

In 2007 Hareide announced that he had left politics for the time being to pursue a career in the national media conglomerate [[Schibsted]], as an organizational director.<ref name="leftpolitics">b</ref> His career in the company started with the position of trainee in 1997. Outside politics, his only paid full-time appointments have been in Schibsted. He still works behind the scenes for his party,<ref name="leftpolitics">c</ref> occasionally commenting on issues in the national media.<ref>an [http://www.vl.no/samfunn/article3146084.ece example] from November 2007 {{no icon}}</ref> He has not ruled out a return to national politics in the future.

===Reception and issues===
Following the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#COP-10, Buenos Aires, Argentina|11th United Nations Climate Change Convention]] in Buenos Aires in December 2004, Hareide spoke out against the United States and China, whom he saw as "problems" in the international work against climate change.<ref>{{cite news |first=Hege |last=Holm |coauthors=Wenche Lamo Hadland |title=- USA er problemet |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/utenriks/4362253.html |work=NRK |date=19 December 2004 |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> Hareide gained a fair level of praise for his role in the convention, from both his own party as well as political opponents.<ref>{{cite news |first=Einar |last=Hagvaag |coauthors=Wenche Lamo Hadland |title=Ikke no' klima |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/tekstarkiv/artikkel.php?id=5001040091981&tag=emneord&words=klima |work=Dagbladet |date=[[19 December]] [[2004]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>

Hareide received heavy criticism for the policy on [[large carnivore]]s. A decision in early 2005, to uphold the ongoing wolf hunt even though a certain [[Alpha (biology)|alpha]] she-wolf ''Gr<U+00E5>fjellstispa'' had mistakenly been shot<ref>{{cite news |first=Anders Holth |last=Johansen |title=Skj<U+00F8>t feil ulv |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2005/01/22/421063.html |work=Dagbladet |date=[[22 January]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> in January that year, was met with protests from the national [[World Wildlife Fund]] chapter and other environment organizations, as well as the Swedish Minister of the Environment [[Lena Sommestad]] and representatives from the European Union. Hareide described the event as "regrettable", but "not against the law".<ref>{{cite news |first=Kristin Straumsheim |last=Gr<U+00F8>nli |title=Ulvejakt vekker internasjonal oppsikt |url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2005/januar/1106767090.26 |work=Forskning.no |date=[[28 January]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> The case made headlines in ''[[BBC]]''<ref>{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Kirby |title=Norway to kill 25% of its wolves |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4194963.stm |work=BBC News |date=[[21 January]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref> and ''[[New Scientist]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Permission given to hunt endangered wolves |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4194963.stm |work=New Scientist |date=[[22 January]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref> A few weeks before, Hareide had been criticized in a parliamentary hearing session for being too wolf-friendly.<ref>{{cite news |first=<U+00D8>ivind |last=Nielsen |title=Sl<U+00E5>r ring om ulven |url=http://www.siste.no/Innenriks/article1409288.ece |work=Siste.no |date=[[12 January]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> The environmental organizations went as far as to press charges against the Ministry of the Environment.<ref>{{cite news |author=NTB |title=Saks<U+00F8>ker staten etter ulvejakt |url=http://web3.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/politikk/article174382.ece?service=print |date=[[2 February]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> The Ministry was acquitted when the case was finally brought up in late 2006,<ref>{{cite news |first=Christian |last=Bakken |title=Staten vant i ulvesaken |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1080476.ece |work=Nettavisen |date=[[8 November]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> some time after Hareide left office.

In July the same year, Hareide received further criticism as the number of licenses to kill large carnivores allegedly was not only at a record high (12 brown bears, 10 grey wolves, 22 wolverines and 13 lynx), but also contradictory to the parliamentary policy on the matter.<ref>{{cite news |first=Leif Tore |last=S<U+00E6>dberg |title=WWF: - For mange rovdyr felles |url=http://web3.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/article208891.ece?service=print |work=Stavanger Aftenblad |date=[[18 July]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> According to Hareide, the actions were in line with the parliamentary stance on the issue.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ragnhild Nordahl |last=N<U+00E6>ss |title=Viltvenner fyrer l<U+00F8>s mot Hareide |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1080476.ece |work=Aftenposten |date=[[15 July]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>

In April 2005 he was criticized for an issue connected to monetary support of environmental projects and organizations. The Ministry approved a $90,000 project support for the [[Church of Norway]], while the pressure group [[Bellona]] faced a cut of the same amount. Hareide, being a devout Christian and a member of the Church of Norway, was accused of putting his own religious interests ahead of environmental considerations.<ref name="churchsupport">{{cite news |author=NTB |title=Prioriterer b<U+00F8>nn foran milj<U+00F8>vern |url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/innenriks/article495061.ece |date=[[20 April]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> The case became a curiosity in the Norwegian media as some of the money was channelled into the church internet site, which, among other things, contained a set of prayers for [[earthworm]]s <U+2013> described in such odd terms as "the blind subterranean workers", "small sisters and brothers in the [[compost]]" and "members of the subterranean congregation".<ref name="churchsupport">b</ref> Hareide responded to the criticism by describing the overall project as "exciting".<ref name="churchsupport">c</ref>

One of Hareide's last actions in office was to approve the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in the Hatteberg watershed in Kvinnherad, a protected natural area. Most of the criticism went to his successor, [[Helen Bj<U+00F8>rn<U+00F8>y]], who neglected to roll back the decision when assuming office.<ref>{{cite news |first=Stine |last=Barstad |title=- Stoltenberg m<U+00E5> redde Hatteberg |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1080476.ece |work=Aftenposten |date=[[30 April]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> She eventually resigned halfway into her term.

During his time as Minister of the Environment, Hareide was parodied in the television comedy program ''[[Tre br<U+00F8>dre som ikke er br<U+00F8>dre]]''. The character Knut Arild Hareide, played by [[Harald Eia]], was portrayed in several [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] as a physically weak person. These parodies were criticized by the authors in a 2005 book about different forms of [[mobbing]]; this stirred a minor debate in the Norwegian media.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lillian |last=Vatn<U+00F8>y |coauthors=Vigdis Alver, Gunnar Hagen |title=- Harald Eia er en IQ-b<U+00F8>lle |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/10/17/446703.html |work=Dagbladet |date=[[17 October]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Geir |last=Evensen |title=- Ikke ondsinnet ment |url=http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/tre_brodre/5148759.html |work=NRK |date=[[17 October]] [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref> Nonetheless, Hareide himself showed a video clip of one of the parodies when publicly announcing his stepdown from national politics at the 2007 party congress.

==Personal life==
Hareide comes from a middle class background, his father being a transportation manager and his mother a consultant.

Although reluctant to comment on the issue, Hareide is likely single.<ref name="leftpolitics">d</ref> He has been confronted with rumours of homosexuality by segments of the media, but these have been dismissed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tore |last=Gjerstad |title=Avkrefter homorykter |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2004/06/19/400929.html |work=Dagbladet |date=[[19 June]] [[2004]] |accessdate=2007-11-28 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>
