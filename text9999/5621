Persi]] and written by [[John Frink]].

==Plot==
When [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] makes a fool of himself on a freeway, [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] manages to catch the whole hilarious scene on his [[mobile phone|phone]]. He calls most of his friends to see Skinner getting beaten up by a drunken [[Barney Gumble|Barney]], but can't call [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]. When [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] asks why, Milhouse explains it's simply because Bart doesn't have a cell phone. Later on, Bart is taunted for missing out on laughing at Skinner. Bart asks [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] for a phone; Marge explains she simply can't afford to get a phone for Bart - she also can't afford to fund a dream trip for [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] to [[Machu Picchu]]. A depressed Bart takes a walk past the Springfield Glen Country Club, and is promptly hit by a golf ball. Angrily, he enters the golf course to hit the golf ball against the person who threw it at him; upon entering, it turns out [[Dr. Hibbert]] had accidentally hit him. Hibbert immediately pays Bart a dollar for retrieving the ball. Surprised, Bart takes the money and gets an inspiration: retrieving golf balls for money, in order to buy a cell phone.

A gleeful Bart is only $20 short, but his glee is cut short when [[Groundskeeper Willie]] discovers Bart is cutting in on ''his'' job. Willie confiscates all the golf balls, prompting Bart to return to his miserable mood. However, nearby, a celebrity golf tournament is underway.  Celebrity [[Denis Leary]] (guest starring as himself) prepares to swing, but misses brutally when his [[cell phone]] rings at the same time. Angrily, Leary throws away his phone, which lands beside Bart. Bart  quits his job and takes Leary's phone all for himself. While going to inform Milhouse of his new cell, Bart receives a call from producer [[Brian Grazer]] (guest starring as himself), who asks Leary to star in the film adaption of ''[[Everyone Poops]]''. Bart, realizing the phone belongs to Leary, pretends to be him. A mischievous Bart makes prank calls all over the world, (using names having to do with sex and the body i.e. Maya Normusbutt) has all of Leary's money spent on [[New York Yankees]] hats and uniforms, among other pranks towards Skinner. Marge overhears Bart and Milhouse's mischievousness, and finally confiscates Bart's phone. Leary recalls his cell, and Marge answers, apologizing for her son's behaviour. Leary, still angry with Bart's tricks, suggests Marge activate the [[GPS]] system on the phone and return it to Bart, meaning she could track down Bart's every move.

Somewhat guiltily, Marge activates the GPS system and returns the phone to Bart. Marge, with the help of the GPS system, is able to prevent Bart from watching an R movie, gambling at a horse race, and skating down steps and hurting himself. Bart now knows that as long as Marge and Homer have him under constant surveillance, he can't have any fun. Lisa is shocked by Marge's injustice, and tells Bart. Predictably, Bart grows angry, and decides to get revenge. He ties the GPS chip to the leg of a [[scarlet tanager]], which flies away. Marge, thinking the bird is Bart, assumes that Bart is running away from her. While [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], Marge, Lisa, and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] are going through a nation-wide search for Bart, Lisa realizes that the bird is the one they had been chasing the whole time. After checking research on her laptop, she discovers the bird is migrating to [[Machu Picchu]], her dream trip they couldn't afford. She deliberately lets the bird go free, so the family can chase it to Machu Picchu. 

Bart relishes his newfound freedom, but is horrified and frightened of being alone at night. When the Simpsons arrive in Machu Picchu in the morning, the family searches for Bart. Marge, despite being exhausted, won't give up, but Lisa convinces her to rest on an ancient sculpture, below the statue of the ancient [[Peru]]vian God of the Sky. Marge, quickly falling asleep, is pulled into a dream world where the God of the Sky shows her Ancient [[Peru]]. He teaches her how throughout history, parents who over-parented their children could never set them free, which was how they were conquered by the [[Conquistador]]s. Upon waking, Marge learns that she cannot over-mother Bart, and must let him take steps for himself. Homer discovers that the family had been following a bird the whole time, assuring Marge she knows exactly where Bart is. Upon returning to Springfield, Marge asks Bart if he missed her. Bart says he didn't notice they were gone (for two weeks), so Marge, depressed, goes upstairs. However, upon reaching the stairs, she is stopped by Bart, who quickly begs her to never leave again. The episode ends with Lisa asking Homer, "Where's Maggie?" As it turns out, the family had left her in Machu Picchu, where she is being worshiped.<ref name=Recapist/>

==Cultural references==
The Swedish barman is modelled on [[Ingmar Bergman]], and his bar is in fact called Inga-Bar Beerman. <ref name="ign"/> The image of the barman in profile and another person in the background is from Bergman's 1966 film [[Persona (film)|Persona]]. The Australian barman resembles [[Crocodile Dundee]], and so his bar is called Crocodile Drunkie. However, the Hawaiian barman is not based on anyone, and his bar is simply named Bar. Skinner plays a human version of the arcade game ''[[Frogger]]'' when trying to cross the interstate for gas.<ref name=Recapist>{{cite news | title = The Simpsons - "Lost Verizon" (Episode 2002)| publisher = The Recapist|url = http://www.recapist.com/2008/10/07/the-simpsons-lost-verizon-episode-2002 | accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref> Marge receives a collection notice from Allied Peas whose corporate mascot bares a striking resemblance to the [[Jolly Green Giant]] while paying for frozen peas on installment.<ref name=Recapist/> Bart, [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]], and [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] grill [[Twizzlers]] licorice.<ref name=Recapist/> Bart suggests to Leary's manager that he order [[New York Yankees]] hats and [[Derek Jeter]] jerseys.
