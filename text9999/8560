==Recent acceleration==
[[Image:Pigshelf.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Floating [[ice shelf]] at the downstream end of Pine Island Glacier. The crack shows the start of a large [[iceberg]] calving]]

In 1981 Terry Hughes proposed that the region around Pine Island Bay may be a "weak underbelly" of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]].<ref name=hughes1981>{{cite journal |author=Hughes T. |title=The weak underbelly of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet |journal=Journal of Glaciology |volume=27 |pages=518<U+2013>525 |year=1981}}</ref> This is based on the fact that, unlike the majority of the large West Antarctic ice streams, those flowing into the [[Amundsen Sea]] are not protected from the ocean by large floating [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. Also, although the surface of the glacier is above sea level, the base lies below sea level and slopes downward inland, this suggests that there is no geological barrier to stop a retreat of the ice once it has started.<ref name=hughes1981/>

The Pine Island and [[Thwaites Glacier|Thwaites]] Glaciers are two of Antarctica's five largest [[ice stream]]s. Scientists have found that the flow of these ice streams has accelerated in recent years, and suggested that if they were to melt, global sea levels would rise by 0.9<U+2013>1.9 m (1<U+2013>2 yards), destabilizing the entire West Antarctic ice sheet and perhaps sections of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].<ref>''With Speed and Violence: Why scientists fear tipping points in climate change'', Fred Pearce, Beacon Press Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-8070-8576-9</ref>

The speed of Pine Island Glacier increased by 73% from 1974 to the end of 2007, with an 8% increase over the last 16&nbsp;months of this period alone. This speed up has meant that by the end of 2007 the Pine Island Glacier system had a negative mass balance of 46&nbsp;[[gigatonne]]s per year,<ref name=rignot2008/> which is equivalent to 0.13&nbsp;mm per year global [[Current sea level rise|sea level rise]].<ref name=shepherdwingham2007>{{cite journal |author=Shepherd A., Wingham D. |title=Recent sea-level contributions of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1529<U+2013>1532 |year=2007 |doi=10.1126/science.1136776}}</ref> In other words, much more water was being put into the sea by PIG than was being replaced by snowfall. Measurements along the center of the ice stream by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] demonstrated that this acceleration is still high nearly 200&nbsp;km inland, at around 4 % over 2007. As the ice stream accelerates it is also getting steeper.<ref name=scott2009>{{cite journal |author=Scott J.B.T., Gudmundsson G.H., Smith A.M., Bingham R.G., Pritchard H.D., Vaughan D.G. |title=Increased rate of acceleration on Pine Island Glacier strongly coupled to changes in gravitational driving stress |journal=The Cryosphere |volume=3 |pages=125<U+2013>131 |year=2009 |url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/3/125/2009/tc-3-125-2009.html}}</ref>

It has been suggested that this recent acceleration could have been triggered by warm ocean waters at the end of PIG, where it has a floating section ([[ice shelf]]) approximately 50&nbsp;km long.<ref name=shepherd2001/><ref name=payne2004/><ref name=thoma2008>{{cite journal |author=Thoma M., Jenkins A., Holland D., Jacobs S. |title=Modelling Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf, Antarctica |journal=[[Geophys.

==Subglacial volcano==
{{see also|Subglacial volcano|Subglacial eruption}}

In January 2008 the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported that 2,200&nbsp;years ago a [[volcano]] erupted under the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. This was the biggest Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000&nbsp;years. The volcano is situated in the [[Hudson Mountains]], close to Pine Island Glacier.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7194579.stm|title=Ancient Antarctic eruption noted|date=January 20, 2008|work=[[BBC]] News|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref><ref name=corr2008>{{cite journal |author=Corr H.F.J., Vaughan D.G. |title=A recent volcanic eruption beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet |journal=[[Nature Geoscience]] |volume=1 |pages=122<U+2013>125 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/ngeo106}}</ref> The eruption spread a layer of [[volcanic ash]] (or [[tephra]]) over the surface of the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby [[ice core]]s.<ref name=corr2008/>  The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/080120-antarctic-volcano.html|title=Buried Volcano Discovered in Antarctica|last=Mosher|first=Dave|date=January 20, 2008|work=Imaginova Corp|publisher=LiveScience.com|accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref>

==History of fieldwork==
===On the ice===
[[Image:Iceseismic.jpg|thumb|right|Seismic surveying on Pine Island Glacier]]

Due to the remoteness of Pine Island Glacier, most of the information available on the ice stream comes from airborne<ref name=vaughan2006/> or satellite-based measurements.<ref name=shepherd2001/><ref name=rignot2008/>

The first expedition to visit the ice stream was a United States over-snow traverse, where they spent around a week in the area of PIG during January 1961. They dug snow pits to measure snow accumulation and carried out seismic surveys to measure ice thickness. One of the scientists on this traverse was [[Charles Bentley|Charlie Bentley]],<ref name=bentley>{{cite web | title = Practically Home | publisher = The Antarctic Sun | url = http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contentHandler.cfm?id=1370 | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}</ref> who claims "we didn't know we were crossing a glacier at the time." This is not surprising, because PIG is around 50&nbsp;km wide at the point visited and at ground level cannot be visually distinguished from the surrounding ice. This expedition, was called the 'Ellsworth Highland Traverse.'<ref name=behrendt2005>{{cite book |last=Behrendt |first=John |year=2005 |title=The Ninth Circle: A memoir of life and death in Antarctica, 1960 - 1962 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0826334253}}</ref><ref name=scott>{{cite web | title = History of Fieldwork on PIG | url = http://www.docjules.com/pig/index.html | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}</ref>

A team from the [[British Antarctic Survey]] arrived at the ice stream on 8 December 2006 for the first of two field seaons. In the second field season, they spent three months there from November 2007 to February 2008. Work on the glacier included [[Ground-penetrating radar|radar]] measurements and [[Reflection seismology|seismic surveys]].<ref name=measuring/>

In January 2008 [[Robert Bindschadler|Bob Bindschadler]] ([[NASA]]) landed on the floating [[ice shelf]] of PIG, this is at the downstream end where it floats on the sea. This landing, by a [[Twin Otter]] plane fitted with skis, was the first ever landing on this ice shelf. The reason for landing on the ice shelf was for a reconnaissance mission to investigate the feasibility of drilling through around 500 m of ice, to lower instruments into the ocean cavity below. It is hoped that this will provide important information on the link between the ocean and Pine Island Glacier.<ref name=antarcticsunPIG>{{cite web | title = Going to the edge | publisher = The Antarctic Sun | url = http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/science/contenthandler.cfm?id=1277 | accessdate = 2009-05-28}}</ref> It was decided that the small [[crevasse]] free area was too hard for further landings and so further fieldwork had to be postponed. Therefore two [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] units and a weather station were positioned as near as possible to PIG.<ref name=discovery>{{cite web | title = Discovery Earth Live | publisher = Discovery Channel | url = http://blogs.discovery.com/discovery_earth_live/ | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}</ref>

===From the sea===
[[Image:PineIslandBay.jpg|thumb|left|Calving front of the Pine Island Glacier's ice shelf. Taken by Tom Kellogg on the USCGC Glacier cruise ''Deep Freeze'']]

The first ship to reach Pine Island Glacier's ice shelf, in Pine Island Bay, was the ''[[USS Glacier (AGB-4)|USS/USCGC Glacier]]'' in 1985. This ship was an icebreaker operated by the US coastguard. The mission, known as ''Deep Freeze'', had scientists on board who took sediment samples from the ocean floor.<ref name=AMGRF>{{cite web | title = USGS Glacier | publisher = Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility | url = http://dev.arf.fsu.edu/publications/glacier.php | accessdate = 2009-04-29}}</ref>

During the summer field season, over two months from January to February 2009, researchers aboard the [[U.S. Antarctic Program]] research vessel ''[[Nathaniel B. Palmer (icebreaker)|Nathaniel B. Palmer]]'' made it to the ice shelf. This was the second time that the ''Palmer'' had successfully made it up to the glacier, the first time being in 1994. In collaboration with the British, the scientists used a robotic submarine to explore the glacier-carved channels on the continental shelf as well as the cavity below the ice shelf and glacier.<ref name="The Antarctic Sun">{{cite web | title = Pine Island Cruise | publisher = The Antarctic Sun | url = http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/science/contenthandler.cfm?id=1752 | accessdate = 2009-05-21}}</ref> The submarine, known as ''Autosub 3'', was developed and built at the [[National Oceanography Centre]] in the UK. It completed six successful missions, travelling a total of 500&nbsp;km under the ice shelf.<ref name=Autosub>{{cite web | title = Robot Submarine | publisher = British Antarctic Survey | url = http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/press/press_releases/press_release.php?id=797 | accessdate = 2009-04-29}}</ref> Autosub is able to map the base of the ice shelf as well as the ocean floor and take various measurements and samples of the water on the way. The success of ''Autosub 3'' was particularly notable because its predecessor Autosub 2 was lost beneath the [[Fimbul Ice Shelf]] on only its second such mission.<ref name=dowdeswell2008>{{cite journal |author=Dowdeswell J.A, Evans J., Mugford R., Griffiths G., McPhail S., Millard N., Stevenson P., Brandon M.A., Banks C., Heywood K.J., Price M.R., Dodd P.A., Jenkins A., Nicholls K.W., Hayes D., Abrahamsen E.P., Tyler P., Bett B., Jones D., Wadhams P., Wilkinson J.P., Stansfield K., Ackley S. |title=Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and investigations of the ice-ocean interface in Antarctic and Arctic waters |journal=[[International Glaciological Society|Journal of Glacioloy]] |volume=54 |pages=661<U+2013>672 |year=2008 |doi=10.3189/002214308786570773}}</ref>
