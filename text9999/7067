'''Copper Breaks State Park''' is a [[state park]] in [[Hardeman County, Texas|Hardeman County]], located approximately {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of [[Quanah, Texas|Quanah]], the county seat.  It covers around {{convert|1900|acre|ha}} and contains two small lakes and {{convert|10|mi|km}} of trails. 

Originally, Copper Breaks was part of the land held by the [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]].  Comanche mound sites can be found in Hardeman County, but not in the park itself.  Purchased from a private landowner in 1970, the state park opened to the public in 1974. 

It receives {{convert|23.4|in|mm}} of rainfall in an average year, allowing the growth of grass and drought-resistant trees such as [[mesquite]] and [[juniper]].

Copper Breaks also includes a portion of the official state [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas longhorn]] herd.
