'''Bradley Joseph''' (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and producer of contemporary  instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from "quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth".<ref name="NaplesDailyNews"/>

Active since 1983, Joseph has performed in front of more than a half million people around the world.<ref name="st.croix"/>  He played various instruments in rock bands throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] until 1989 when [[Greece|Greek]] composer [[Yanni]] hired him for his core band after hearing a tape of his original compositions. He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours, most recently in 2003 for the 60-city ''[[Ethnicity (Yanni album)|Ethnicity]]'' tour.  He appears in the multi-platinum album and concert film, ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]]''. Joseph also spent four years as [[musical director]] and lead keyboardist for [[Sheena Easton]], including a 1995 performance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.

Joseph is the founder of the Robbins Island Music label.  His solo career began when he independently released ''[[Hear the Masses]],'' featuring many of his Yanni bandmates. This debut was followed by ''[[Rapture (Bradley Joseph album)|Rapture]]'', an instrumental album recorded with a 50-piece orchestra in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores. It was released on the [[Narada Productions|Narada]] label and reached [[Zone Music Reporter|ZMR]] Airwaves Top 30.  A number of subsequent recordings including ''[[Christmas Around the World]]'' and ''[[One Deep Breath]]'' also held positions on ZMR's Top 100 radio chart, with the most recent being ''[[Paint the Sky]]'' which debuted at #15 in April 2013.    ''Paint the Sky'' was nominated for Best Neo-Classical Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards.<ref name="ZMR Nom">{{cite web | url=http://www.zonemusicreporter.com/admin/nominees_site.asp | title=The 10th Annual ZMR Music Award Nominees | publisher=zonemusicreporter.com | accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>  He has produced numerous CDs/DVDs and piano books. His music is included in multiple various-artist compilation albums including the 2008 release of ''[[The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II]]''.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Bradley Joseph was born in [[Bird Island, Minnesota]] and raised in [[Willmar, Minnesota]],<ref name="Parsons-Interview"/> graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983.<ref name="Heeeeeeere's Bradley"/>  He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench.<ref name="audiointerview"/>  One morning his father taught him how to play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece.<ref name="Official bio"/>  He started playing classical piano at age eight,<ref name="Official bio"/> taking lessons for a year and a half but was self-taught thereafter.<ref name="audiointerview"/>  While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw [[Buddy Rich]] perform. He recalls, "I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked <U+2014> the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared."<ref name="Official bio"/>  Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school,<ref name="daily telegram1"/> and trombone through high school and college.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  When he picked up the horn, he got a whole new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different [[timbre]]s available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras.<ref name="daily telegram2"/>  The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics.<ref name="audiointerview"/>  After attending [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|Moorhead State University]] as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs.  He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> Later, he started performing with guitarist [[Dugan McNeill]], whose [[U2]]-like group was signed to Polygram.<ref name="Official bio"/>  McNeill and [[Yanni]] had once played together in the technopop band [[Chameleon (American band)|Chameleon]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

===Yanni===
In 1989, Joseph recorded his first demo tape and sent it off to Greek composer [[Yanni]], who was looking for someone to replace keyboardist [[John Tesh]], as Tesh was launching his own solo career.<ref name="Yanni in Words"/>  When Yanni heard Joseph's compositions and arrangements, he was hired over the phone to join his core band, without ever meeting.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> 
{{Rquote|left|When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni.<ref name="SJSheet"/>}}
After moving to [[Los Angeles]] at age 23,<ref name="AlbumNotesStories"/> he composed, arranged, and performed alongside Yanni for more than six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame.<ref name="Bradley Joseph to play for Concerts in the Park"/>  His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] filming a video project. "It was a real trial by fire for me", said Joseph.<ref name="Official bio"/>  "First show + 10,000 people + TV cameras equals NERVOUS."<ref name="SJSheet"/>  He told Jane Fredericksen of the ''St. Croix Valley Press'' that "It was a big jump, you don't really realize it at the time, but there's no in-between <U+2014> going from playing nightclubs to arenas."<ref name="st.croix"/> Some of these early tours included the ''[[Reflections of Passion]]'', ''[[In Celebration of Life|Revolution in Sound]]'', ''[[Dare to Dream (Yanni album)|Dare to Dream]]'',<ref name="Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 - Official concert program"/> ''[[In My Time|Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts]]'' 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers.<ref name="Heeeeeeere's Bradley"/>  Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]].''<ref name="Yanni in Words"/>  He recounts, "When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni.  Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems.  I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show.  People still come up to me and comment how that show has affected their lives."<ref name="SJSheet"/>

In the band, Joseph covered a lot of the keyboard parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage,<ref name="SL Tribune1"/> and helped layer with the orchestra to create a "full-bodied, live-effect sound".<ref name="SL Tribune2"/>  He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>   Joseph said that "[Yanni] gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. If you listen to the original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input."<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.<ref name="AlbumNotesRapture"/>

Between tours, Joseph worked extensively in recording studios on music ranging from rock and pop to rhythm and blues and orchestration with numerous artists from [[RCA]], [[Epic Records|Epic]], [[Warner Brothers]], and [[Polygram Records]],<ref name="Live, The Symphony Concerts 1994 - Official concert program"/> in addition to performing in an elaborate national keyboard show tour with various musicians.<ref name="Dare to Dream - Official concert program"/>  In 2003, he returned for the 60-city ''[[Ethnicity (Yanni album)|Ethnicity]]'' tour.<ref name="reflections"/>

===Sheena Easton===
Joseph also performed with [[Sheena Easton]] for four years as her [[Musical director|co-musical director]] and lead keyboardist.<ref name="Continuing Journey"/> He went from Yanni to Easton and back to Yanni in a few years.  "It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again", he said in reference to Easton's [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] style. "I went back to where I started but it felt like a new invention."<ref name="Joseph has Encountered Fame"/>

{{Rquote|right|Working with Easton was "...a shock in musical styles but a welcome change."<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>}} Wheeler questioned how he got hooked up with Easton; Joseph answered that he was recommended by a former road manager. He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, they then cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> Joseph anticipated they would ask him to do a solo on at least one of the songs he was asked to play during the audition, so he wrote a solo for all three songs, which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job.<ref name="WPSaward"/>

In a 1995 interview, he said that after five years of touring with Yanni and working on his own debut album, he needed a break.  Yanni was still building his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule.  Working with Easton, on the other hand, was "the best of both worlds".  "She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in", said Joseph.<ref name="Heeeeeeere's Bradley"/> Tour venues with her included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States,<ref name="Official bio"/> as well as routine appearances in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Atlantic City]].<ref name="Heeeeeeere's Bradley"/> In March 1995, he appeared with her on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' when she performed her new single at the time, "My Cherie".<ref name="Joseph Tonight Show"/>

===Solo career===

====More Core Records====
In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, ''[[Hear the Masses]]'', a self-produced, self-published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions.  He invited most of the Yanni band to contribute.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  They include [[Charlie Adams (drummer)|Charlie Adams]] (drums, percussion); [[Ric Fierabracci]] (fretless bass); [[Jeanette Clinger]] (vocals); and [[Grammy]]-winning violinist [[Charlie Bisharat]].  Other guest artists include Larry Preston (guitar); and Terry Brau <U+2014> featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings <U+2014> playing trumpet, saxophone, and [[fluegelhorn]].

====Narada====
{{Rquote|left|Joseph's music is backed by 15 talented musicians, some  playing three or more different instruments, that make up a symphony of sounds ranging from quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth.|Ken Moore|''Naples Daily News''<ref name="NaplesDailyNews"/>}} 
Joseph's style attracted the attention of [[Narada Productions]],<ref name="ShowGo"/> a [[Virgin Records]] subsidiary, via the [[World-Wide Web|World Wide Web]].  A representative for Narada came across his website and downloaded some music.  This sparked their interest and resulted in signing Joseph to a multi-record deal, according to Peter Spellman of the [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref name="BerkleeShares"/> The outcome was ''[[Rapture (Bradley Joseph album)|Rapture]]'', containing intimate piano pieces, quartets, and full orchestral works.<ref name="Official bio"/>  It reached ZMR's "Airwaves Top 30" at No.&nbsp;15 in July 1997.<ref name="New Age VoiceTop30"/>  This album was recorded at a number of different studios including [[Captain and Tennille]]'s studio in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]],<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/> and [[Pachyderm Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]].<ref name="Blllboard Magazine"/>  In addition to a core band including [[Charlie Adams (drummer)|Charlie Adams]] on percussion, [[Charlie Bisharat]] on violin, and Steven Trochlil on clarinet, Joseph brought in a 50-piece orchestra, and conducted and wrote all the scores.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>   Ken Moore of the ''Naples Daily News'' cites, "Joseph's music is backed by 15 talented musicians, some playing three or more different instruments, that make up a symphony of sounds ranging from quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth."<ref name="NaplesDailyNews"/>  ''Wind and Wire Magazine'' contributor, Michael Debbage, recalls, "It was the year 1997 and New Age music had already peaked commercially as the interest and exposure seemed to lag. The genres main labels &ndash; Narada, Windham Music, and Higher Octave &ndash; were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established. It appeared that the abundance of new artists was becoming a dying breed. An exception to the rule was Bradley Joseph, who released his first mainstream album ''Rapture'' to glorious reviews, and to this day it remains his [[wikt:tour de force|tour de force]]."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  One of Joseph's compositions, "[[The Glen]]", was written solely for the album ''[[Stories (Narada Artist Collection)|Stories, a Narada Artist Collection]]'', and is now also featured on ''[[20 Years of Narada Piano]]''.  His works are included in other Narada compilation projects as well.

====Robbins Island Music====
Although Joseph said that working with Narada was a great experience music-wise, he did not like the lack of control over the end product, and asked to be released from his contract.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  He started Robbins Island Music in 1998, composing, producing, and distributing his own recordings. ''[[Solo Journey]]'' was released and consists of eleven soft piano compositions that are based on mood and not on melody.<ref name="WPSaward"/>  It is characterized by Debbage as being a "scaled down introspective, ... and while simplistic was still breath-taking".<ref name="Christmas Around the World at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>

Later releases include ''[[Christmas Around the World]]'' reaching [[Zone Music Reporter|ZMR's]] Top 100 Radio Playlist;<ref name="New Age Voice"/> and ''[[One Deep Breath]]'' also holding a position on ZMR's Top 100 Radio Chart for over six months.<ref name="NAV's top 100"/> Bill Binkelman writes that while he doubts fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces, as well as for lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music."<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB"/>  Reviewing for ''[[Allmusic]]'', Jim Brenholts describes ''One Deep Breath'' as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds "world music flair and inspirational touches".  "The vocal expressions by Clystie Whang and Joseph have devotional qualities that weave through the atmospheres and soundscapes smoothly."<ref name="One Deep Breath at Allmusic"/> {{Rquote|right|The special audiences and beautiful cities inspired me to compose after sound checks... What an inspiration it was for me to sit alone on stage in these grand arenas and compose music.<ref name="Fall 2003 Newsletter"/>}}

Joseph returned as a featured instrumentalist during Yanni's 2003 ''[[Ethnicity (Yanni album)|Ethnicity]]'' world tour,<ref name="Ethnicity"/> and wrote his sixth album on stage after sound checks.<ref name="Fall 2003 Newsletter"/> ''[[The Journey Continues (Bradley Joseph album)|The Journey Continues]]'', a sequel to ''Solo Journey'', features Joseph on solo piano.  Debbage writes, "The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with ''Solo Journey'' that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that ''The Journey Continues'' is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>

Subsequent releases include ''[[For the Love of It (album)|For the Love of It]]'', ''[[Piano Love Songs]]'', and ''[[Hymns and Spiritual Songs (album)|Hymns and Spiritual Songs]]''.  On these albums, Joseph arranges piano, orchestra, and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as "[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]" ([[Burt Bacharach]]), "[[Fields of Gold]]" ([[Sting (musician)|Sting]]), and "[[Ellens dritter Gesang|Ave Maria]]" ([[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]). He has produced numerous CD and DVD projects designed for pets in a ''[[Music Pets Love: While You Are Gone|Music Pets Love]]'' series.<ref name="WBL"/><ref name="GTN"/>  He has also produced a four-CD set of Nature Sounds and has published many of his compositions in sheet music form.  His music is used throughout the DVD, ''Isle Royale Impressions Volume II'', containing video footage by Carl TerHaar of scenery and wildlife from the [[Isle Royale National Park]] in Michigan.<ref name="IRNHA"/>

In April 2013, Joseph released his first album of original compositions in 10 years entitled ''[[Paint the Sky]]'' which debuted at #15 on ZMR's Top 100 Radio Chart.  It is self-described as "piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel".<ref name="PTS-PressRelease"/>  He received requests from listeners to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano, similar to ''Hear The Masses'' and ''Rapture''.<ref name="Parsons-Interview"/>  Kathy Parsons of ''MainlyPiano'' states that "Joseph is obviously a very versatile musician, and there are a lot of influences and musical styles that meld together to make ''Paint the Sky'' an exceptional musical experience."<ref name="parsons-PTS"/>  Michael Debbage of ''MainlyPiano'' writes that ''Paint the Sky'' represents Joseph<U+2019>s most complete recording since his landmark album ''Rapture''. He goes on to say that "whether you have enjoyed Joseph<U+2019>s more spatial recordings or his deeper embellished adventures, ''Paint The Sky'' essential is a musical rainbow of where Joseph has been and where he can potential go."<ref name="Debbage-PTS"/>

====Accolades and achievements====
Joseph was named one of the ''"Ten Outstanding Young Minnesotans"'' (TOYM) of 2004 by the Minnesota [[Jaycees]].<ref name="TOYM Award"/><ref name="WBL Composer Named Outstanding Young Minnesotan"/><ref name="Metro People Bradley Joseph"/> In April 2008 he was presented the "WPS Foundation Arts and Academics Hallmarks of Pride" award for outstanding achievements by an alumnus.<ref name="WPSaward"/> His music has been on Billboard charts, #1 on [[Amazon.com]], #1 on [[ITunes]], and top 40 for Sirius satellite radio.

Joseph's music has been heard in regular [[spin (radio)|rotation]] in the United States and Canada by more than 160 major radio networks including [[XM Satellite Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] satellite radio, [[DMX (music)|DMX]]; in the United Kingdom including [[RT<U+00C9> lyric fm]]; as well as airwaves in Japan, Spain, China, South-East Asia, Thailand, Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. Airlines such as [[Aerom<U+00E9>xico]], [[AirTran Airways|AirTran]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]], and [[ExpressJet Airlines|ExpressJet]] feature his music in their in-flight music programs.  [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]] also utilizes his compositions during the "Local on the 8s" segments, and the song "[[Hear the Masses|Friday's Child]]" is included in their 2008 compilation release, ''[[The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II]]''.<ref name="TWC-Midas"/>

''Paint the Sky'' (2013) was nominated for Best [[Neoclassical (New Age)|Neo-Classical]] Album in the 10th annual ZMR Music Awards.<ref name="ZMR Nom"/>

====Thoughts on success as an independent artist====
Having experienced both avenues of recording on a [[Major record labels|major label]] and later choosing to be an [[Independent music|independent artist]], a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music.  He spends most of his time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told [[West Central Tribune]]'s Anne Polta.<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>    As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent."  "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players."<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>

In an interview with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed a great deal from when he was younger.  He said, "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses."<ref name="NFOJ"/>  But some artists just want to  be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both.  Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants.  He advises, "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time.  All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything."<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  He explains, "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business.  And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for."<ref name=NFOJ/>

When asked by Wheeler what brought him back to Minnesota after living in Los Angeles and traveling around the world, Joseph replied, "The first thing business people say is 'First and foremost, if you want to be successful, live where you want to live'."  He grew  up there and family were important to him.  When he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>

==Composition and musical style==

===On composing===
{{Rquote|left|The piano is always true to me. In times of despair, happiness, and joy, its mood is always my own.|Bradley Joseph|<ref name="AlbumNotesGrand"/>}}

In an interview with ''Indie Journal'', Joseph said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first, stating, "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint.  First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener."<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the ''Government Television Network'' with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody.  Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right.  Then he would start "building around it",  like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it.<ref name="GTN"/> Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and everyone feels everyday.  "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>

Debbage comments, "One strength of Bradley Joseph as an artist has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally".<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  Joseph explained to Janus that, "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed to come up with musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything.  It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it.  And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences."<ref name=NFOJ/>  He believes that "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." <ref name="xtrememusic.org"/>  He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says.<ref name="xtrememusic.org"/>  Parsons goes on to say, "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own."<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-ODB"/> Yanni once said, "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift".<ref name="WPSaward"/> Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component "to be sensitive to what you see and to be able to apply that to music".<ref name="WPSaward"/>

Polta reports that he often references the past when he names his songs and his music is frequently reminiscent of his rural [[Minnesota]] roots.<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>  "Wind Farmer" was inspired by childhood visits to a relative's farm near [[Olivia, Minnesota|Olivia]], and his company, Robbins Island Music, is named after a city park in [[Willmar, Minnesota|Willmar]].<ref name="Continuing Journey"/>

Joseph employs a variety of instruments to compose including the [[Korg Triton]] music workstation, Korg SG-1 piano, and occasionally [[Korg M1]]. Rack units have included [[Roland JD-800]], and [[Roland JV-1080]] which he says is "great for string layers".<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  The [[Alesis|Alesis D4]], Yamaha SY22, and [[Yamaha TG77]] which has "some nice ethereal textures" have been utilized; working also with [[E-mu Systems]] Proteus 1, Proteus 2, and the E-5000 sampler because it is "easy to use and has a great library".<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  Acoustic pianos vary, [[Yamaha (piano)|Yamaha]] and [[B<U+00F6>sendorfer]] were used for the 1997 album, ''Rapture''.

===Musical style===
<!--Per 2013 NFC Review - Suggestion to obtain talk page consensus before adding clips from future works.  (see talk)) -->
Joseph's musical style and direction have varied over time, having released more than two hundred original compositions and arrangements since 1994.  "When I write it, it just kind of moves, because where I am in life is different", Joseph said. "So as I get older, it kind of changes."<ref name="WBL Composer Named Outstanding Young Minnesotan"/>

Joseph's recordings can offer full orchestrations such as in ''Hear the Masses'' and ''Rapture'' that combine smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes.<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/> A review of ''Rapture'' from ''New Age Voice'' states Joseph "paints romantic pictures in sound with voices and instruments that escalate from quiet, intimate passages to big, energetic movements".

====''Solo Journey'' and ''The Journey Continues''====
In contrast, albums such as ''Solo Journey'' and ''The Journey Continues'' are considered to be "stripped back and basic" by Debbage, with the latter featuring "Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter".  "There is color in the songs via their understated melodies."<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  As examples, Debbage describes Joseph as using a chord progression that translates into a strolling rhythm in the song "The Road Ahead".<ref name="The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  ''Solo Piano Publications'' contributor, Kathy Parsons, writes, "...'The Long, Last Mile' starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano. Then it breaks off, and the opening melody returns."<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-SJ"/>

====''One Deep Breath''====
For the 2002 album ''One Deep Breath'', Joseph combines "structured melodic pieces and free-form ambient compositions",<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-ODB"/> which "departs dramatically from the previous more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, ''Hear the Masses'' and ''Rapture''".<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB"/>  Binkelman writes, "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between."<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB"/>   For instance, the song "Dance of Life" was inspired by [[Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]]'s opera, "[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]".<ref name="AlbumNotesODB"/>  It is a bit more straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says ''Instrumental Weekly''.<ref name="InstrumentalWeekly"/>  Then the album closes with its title track, "One Deep Breath", that "floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds".<ref name="SPP-Kathy Parsons-ODB"/> It is "far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here",<ref name="InstrumentalWeekly">{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.instrumentalweekly.com/reviewarchive/mar2002/20020301.asp|title= Review of ''One Deep Breath''|publisher = Instrumental Weekly (archived page from instrumentalweekly.com)|accessdate=2006-12-21 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020706100223/http://www.instrumentalweekly.com/reviewarchive/mar2002/20020301.asp |archivedate=2002-07-06}}</ref>  and is "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".<ref name="One Deep Breath-Wind and Wire Magazine-BB"/>

====''Christmas Around the World'' and ''Classic Christmas''====
Debbage depicts "A Minnesota Snowfall" from ''Christmas Around the World'' as taking "a more naked, bare-boned [[ballad]] approach".<ref name="Christmas Around the World at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage"/>  While discussing ''[[Classic Christmas (Bradley Joseph album)|Classic Christmas]]'', Gerry Grzyb, chairman of the University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Oshkosh sociology department, states that Joseph's usual approach is to play the carol straight, and then add his own twists.  "... he's very effective at that<U+2014>he doesn't stray as far as a jazz or classical organ improviser might, but he does keep the interest up."    Grzyb says that the same applies to Joseph's earlier ''Christmas Around the World'' CD, which he found even more interesting because of the use of other instrumental sounds.<ref name="northwestern"/>

====''Suites & Sweets''====
Joseph has also produced numerous CDs that include cover arrangements for piano and orchestra. The 2009 release of ''[[Suites & Sweets]]'' features compositions by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], and other classical composers.  Joseph told Fredericksen that he, "took the best parts and movements out of those classical songs <U+2026> and made it soft and calm all the way through."<ref name="st.croix"/>

====''Paint the Sky''====

After requests from listeners for Joseph to do another CD with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano, similar to ''Hear The Masses'' and ''Rapture'', Joseph released ''[[Paint the Sky]]'' in April 2013.<ref name="Parsons-Interview"/>  It is self-described as "piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel".<ref name="PTS-PressRelease"/>  John P. Olsen of ''New Age Music World'' writes that "''Paint The Sky'' ...is best expressed by the near even number of songs with upbeat melodies and lively rhythms, with the balance centered by a light, casual relaxed atmosphere...with importance given to melodic rhythm and phrasing."<ref name="olsen-PTS"/> In another review of ''Paint the Sky'', Bill Binkelman of ''Wind and Wire'' says that "Joseph is one of the very best artists when it comes to crafting piano instrumentals augmented by the spot-on application of an assortment of keyboard embellishments, from standard orchestral accompaniment to more textural/new age elements".<ref name="windwire-PTS"/>  Kathy Parsons of ''MainlyPiano'' states "The thirteen pieces ...range from tender to majestic. Several pieces are solo piano and others are orchestrated with keyboards to give a vibrant, cinematic effect."<ref name="parsons-PTS"/>

About this album, Binkelman describes the song "Inside the Stars" as "an uptempo, joyous lead piano melody accented by bouncy rhythms played on kit drums, thumping bass, and tambourine plus superlative orchestral strings".<ref name="windwire-PTS"/>  Michael Debagge of ''MainlyPiano'' states that "the optimism of this album is felt immediately courtesy of the buoyancy of 'Inside The Stars', filled with Joseph<U+2019>s nifty piano work more in the vein of [[Bruce Hornsby]], then layered in strings and percussion work".<ref name="Debbage-PTS"/>

In an in-depth analysis of the composition "In Dreams Awake", Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that some people might even hear strains of [[Philip Glass]]<U+2019> music. He says there is an exultant feel to the melody, but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast. As the track progresses, the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif, with more textural synths, bell tones and bell trees, and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur. The Glass-like motif returns for the song<U+2019>s finale.<ref name="windwire-PTS"/>  Parsons characterizes this same song as "a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings. Building as it evolves, it never takes a breath until near the end of the theme. From there, the piece becomes dreamy and ambient, "floating effortlessly" on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter, increasing to the intensity of the first theme".<ref name="parsons-PTS"/> At the same time, Debbage notes "...the multi-movements found on the challenging 'In Dreams Awake'..." and says that it "...opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other, only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings, much like our nonsensical dreams".<ref name="Debbage-PTS"/>

Binkleman goes on to say that the song "Into the Big Blue" should instantly call [[Aaron Copland]] to mind <U+2013> it has the same BIG orchestral/cinematic sound to it, along with Copland-esque western rhythm and melodic motifs.<ref name="windwire-PTS"/>  Similarly, Debbage states that this song brings to mind the musical opening theme of that old western television show ''[[The Big Valley]]''.<ref name="Debbage-PTS"/>

In reference to the song "Secrets of the Sun", Binkelman describes "lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic with a dash of wistfulness besides". The synth sounds remind him a little of [[Ray Lynch]].<ref name="windwire-PTS"/>  Parsons details this as "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements".<ref name="parsons-PTS"/>  Debbage writes that "the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph<U+2019>s uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads. Back track to 'Secrets Of The Sun' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on 'The Edge Of My Heart'.<ref name="Debbage-PTS"/>

===Genres and radio formats===
Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in the [[Adult contemporary music#Soft adult contemporary|adult contemporary]], [[smooth jazz]], [[easy listening]], and [[beautiful music]] radio formats, and while some is classified in the [[New age music|new age]] genre, he considers [[Instrumental music|contemporary instrumental]] to fit his style of playing the best.<ref name="Indie Journal Interview"/>  In discussing ''Rapture'', John Blake of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Journal]]'' notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy <U+2014> soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. "For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake."<ref name="Atlanta"/>  "The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream."<ref name="Atlanta"/> Along the same line, Michael Debbage of ''Mainly Piano'' says that ''Rapture'' almost single-handedly gave a sense of hope that there was much more that the New Age genre could offer.<ref name="Debbage-PTS"/>  Cicily Janus remarks that, "Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities."<ref name="NFOJ"/>
