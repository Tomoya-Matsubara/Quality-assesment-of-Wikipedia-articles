The '''Type 206''' is a class of diesel-electric [[submarines]] ([[U-boat]]s) developed by [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft|Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW)]]. Its design is based on the preceding [[Type 205 submarine]] class. These small and agile submarines were built during the [[Cold War]] to operate in the shallow [[Baltic Sea]] and attack [[Warsaw Pact]] shipping if the war turned hot. The pressure hulls were built out of non-magnetic [[steel]] to counter the threat of magnetic [[naval mine]]s and make detection with [[Magnetic anomaly detector|MAD]] sensors more difficult. The low emission profile allowed the submarines in exercises to intrude even into well protected opposing forces such as carrier formations with their screen.

==Programme==
[[File:Uss enterprise viewed by U24.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Enterprise'' pictured through ''U 24'' 's periscope during an exercise in the Caribbean]]
Ten [[Type 205 submarine|Type 205]] submarines were constructed between 1962 and 1968 with hulls constructed of a new non-magnetic steel. The early boats, however, suffered from cracking due to stress corrosion and an urgent programme was initiated to develop a new steel which overcame these problems, which received much publicity at the time. The new high-strength, non-magnetic, austenitic steel has greater elasticity and good dynamic strength, and has proved very satisfactory in service, thoroughly overcoming the doubts that were raised by those early problems, although it has never been selected by IKL's many export customers and thus remains unique to German Navy submarines. Subsequently, the Type 206 was designed by IKL in 1964-65 and a production order was placed on 7 June 1969 for eight from HDW in [[Kiel]] and ten from [[Nordseewerke]] in [[Emden]].

Of the 18 submarines built for the [[Bundesmarine]] (West German Navy), 12 were modernized in the early 1990s and were re-designated as '''Type 206A'''; the others have been decommissioned. The current [[German Navy]] is starting to decommission some 206A vessels, with more of the new [[Type 212 submarine]]s being commissioned. In June 2010 the Ministry of Defence announced that all six remaining vessels were to be retired from active service immediately and to be decommissioned by the end of 2010 to cut costs.<ref name="spacewar.com"/>

A slightly modified variant of the Type 206 (which includes the distinctive dome, or bulge, in the front of the boat), the [[Gal class submarine|''Gal''-class submarine]] for the [[Israeli Navy]] was built to Israeli specifications as the [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd|Vickers]] Type 540 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] rather than Germany for political reasons.  Three such boats were built, the first being commissioned in 1976. When the Israeli navy received its new [[Dolphin class submarine|''Dolphin''-class submarine]]s (also built by HDW), the ''Gal''s were retired. As of 2006, one had been scrapped and two had been sent to HDW in an attempt to find a buyer for them. When no buyer was found, one of the submarines was returned to Israel for display in the [[Haifa]] naval museum.

==Modernisation==
A major mid-life modernisation was conducted on twelve of these submarines, the boats concerned now being officially designated Type 206A. The work started in mid-1987 and completed in February 1992, being carried out by Nordseewerke, Emden; this upgrade includes:

The STN Atlas DBQS-21D sonar has been fitted, together with new periscopes, and a new weapon control system (LEWA). The ESM system has been replaced and GPS navigation installed. The rebuilt submarines are armed with new torpedoes (''Seeaal''), and the propulsion system has been comprehensively refurbished, and improvements have been made to the accommodation.

'''Notes:'''
* After its decommissioning, ''U21'' had an ever-changing history: First it should have been sold to [[Indonesia]] as ''Cundamanik''. After the deal failed it was about to be scrapped in [[Itzehoe]], but HDW managed to salvage it for the planned company's museum in Kiel. After that had to be given up, ''U21'' was gifted to the city of [[Eckernf<U+00F6>rde]] and towed there. For a short time it had been a well accepted tourist attraction/technology museum, but because of local politics it was sold for scrap and broken up. <!-- :( -->
* ''U13'', ''U14'', ''U19'' and ''U20'' were also to be sold to [[Indonesia]]. Their names would have been ''Nagarongsang'', ''Nagabanda'', ''Bramastra'' and ''Alugoro''.
* The six surviving submarines are all upgraded Type 206A ones.<ref name=BW>{{cite web|url=http://www.marine.de/portal/a/marine/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKOD_QzA8mB2d5mIfqRcNGglFR9X4_83FR9b_0A_YLciHJHR0VFAMCgKn8!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjNfUVQ2?yw_contentURL=%2F01DB070000000001%2FW2699KBL528INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp
