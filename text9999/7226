'''''Golden Sun''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''<U+014C>gon no Taiy<U+014D> Hirakareshi F<U+016B>in'''''|<U+9EC4><U+91D1><U+306E><U+592A><U+967D> <U+958B><U+304B><U+308C><U+3057><U+5C01><U+5370>||literally "Golden Sun: The Broken Seal"}}, is the first installment of a series of [[Console role-playing game|role-playing]] video games developed by [[Camelot Software Planning]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. It was released in November 2001 for Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]], with a Game Boy Advance sequel, ''[[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]]'', in 2003. The game is notable for certain unique game elements, such as the use of special "[[Genie|Djinn]]" that empower the player and can be used against enemies. 

The story follows a band of magic-attuned "adepts" who are sent from their home town into the wide world of [[Weyard]] to prevent the destructive power of [[alchemy]] from being released as it was in the past. Along the way the adepts gain new abilities, help out the local populations, and learn more about why alchemy was sealed away.<ref name=manual>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual | pages=2<U+2013>29 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> Upon its release, the game was highly praised; [[IGN]] said that ''Golden Sun'' could "arguably be one of the best 2D-based Japanese RPGs created for any system."<ref name=ignreview>{{cite web|author=Harris, Craig|date=2001-11-09|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165255p1.html|title=IGN ''Golden Sun'' Review|work=ign.com|accessmonthday=February 1 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> <!--The game eventually went on to sell nearly two million copies internationally.-->

==Gameplay==
''Golden Sun'' is a contemporary presentation of the traditional [[console role-playing game]] formula, where the player guides a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed game world, interact with other characters, battle many monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and take part in a building, predefined narrative.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual | pages=3 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref>  While many actions the player takes are compulsory, ''Golden Sun'' often allows the player to complete certain objectives out of order, and to visit previous locations, which can advance minor story elements.

Much of the game's time spent outside of battle takes place in [[dungeon crawl|dungeon]]s, caves, and other locales involving many puzzles integrated into their layout.<ref name=advice/> One must push logs into rivers in order to cross them, shift the track of a mine cart to access new areas, and a host of other activities in order to get from point A to point B and progress through the story and game world.<ref name=advice>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Advice for Adepts | pages=50<U+2013>53| publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> Many of these puzzles revolve heavily around the usage of the game<U+2019>s resident form of [[magic (fantasy)|magic spells]], "Psynergy," requiring the player to find items that grant the bearer new forms of psynergy in order to accomplish tasks.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Psynergy | pages=18| publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:GoldenSunPsynergy.png|thumb|right|240px|Psynergy spells can be used both in battle and in dungeons. Here, a cold spell is used to create a traversable path of frozen ice pillars from puddles of water.]]
Both successful exploration of the game<U+2019>s world and victory in the game<U+2019>s battles are heavily dependent on the smart usage of the hundreds of Psynergy spells available.<ref name="psynergy">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensun.rpgplanet.gamespy.com/gs/psynergy.php|title=Psynergy List|work=Goldensun.rpgplanet.gamespy.com|accessmonthday=July 10 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Whereas many other [[Console role-playing game|RPG]]s limit the usage of their forms of magic to battles as offensive and defensive measures, Psynergy spells can be used both for battle, and for solving puzzles in the game<U+2019>s locales.<ref name=ae>{{cite web|date=2001-12-08|author=Flowe, Doug|url=http://www.armchairempire.com/Reviews/gba/golden_sun.htm|title=GBA Reviews: Golden Sun|work=armchairempire.com|accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> Some types of psynergy can only be used in combat; conversely, many spells are only used in the game's [[overworld]] and in non-battle scenarios. At the same time, Psynergy spells can also be used in both situations; for example, the <U+201C>Whirlwind<U+201D> spell that can be used to damage enemies in battle is also used out of battle to clear away overgrown foliage that may block the player<U+2019>s path.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Advice for Adepts| pages=51| publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> Psynergy comes in four [[element]]s: [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] (Manipulation of rocks and plants), [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] (Revolving around fire and heat), [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] (Based on wind and electricity), and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (Concerning water and ice).<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Djinn | pages=16 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> The player gains more and more Psynergy spells as the game progresses, either through [[Experience point|levelling up]] or acquiring and equipping (using) special items, and with each "utility" Psynergy spell the party gains access to more and more locations and secrets hidden within the game world. Players may return to previous locations in the game to finish off puzzles which they could not solve earlier because of the lack of a specific Psynergy spell.<ref name=advice/>

===Battle===
[[Image:GoldenSunBattle.png|frame|left|240px|Battles in ''Golden Sun'' are full of special effects. Here, a magic-enhanced attack is unleashed by the sword Gaia Blade.]]
''Golden Sun'' contains both [[random encounter|random monster encounters]], featuring randomly generated enemies,<ref name=allgame/> and compulsory battles, which advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought up where the enemy party is on the opposing side (the background) and the player<U+2019>s party is on the battling side (in the foreground, with only the character<U+2019>s backs visible). When a battle is conducted and progresses, the characters and the background swirl around and change positions in a pseudo-[[3D computer graphics|3D]] effect.<ref name="spaceworld"/>

The gameplay in relation to ''Golden Sun''<U+2019>s battle mode is similar to traditional [[Console role-playing game|console RPGs]]. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies by using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping the player<U+2019>s own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Shops, Inns, and Sanctums | pages=34 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> If the player's entire party is downed by reducing their [[hit points]] to zero, it is considered <U+201C>Game Over<U+201D>, and the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a monetary penalty. The successful completion of a battle yields [[experience points]], coins, and rare [[item|items]].<ref name=rpg>{{cite web|author=Nguyen, Chase|url=http://www.allrpg.com/games/goldensun/index.php3?page=review&num=2|title=Golden Sun|work=allrpg.com|accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref>

In addition to the main game itself, there is also a competitive battling mode accessible from the menu screen, where players can enter their currently-developed team from their saved game files into an arena environment where they can battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies or other players head-to-head to see which of their team setups are stronger. In both cases there are no experience points or coins to be earned.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: The Arena | pages=52<U+2013>54 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref>

===Djinn system===
[[Image:GoldenSunDjinnScreen.png|frame|right|240px|Djinn can be arranged to bring out complex character classes. The pictured class setup is one of the more statistically powerful setups available.]]
One of the most important features in ''Golden Sun'' is the collecting and manipulation of magical creatures called [[Genie|Djinn]]. Djinn can be found scattered in hiding throughout the game, for each of the four elements and likewise for allocation to each character. The Djinn form the basis of the game<U+2019>s statistic enhancement, as well as the system that dictates the character<U+2019>s Psynergy capabilities.<ref name=p19>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Djinn and their Abilities | pages=19 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> Attaching different djinn to different characters modifies that character's [[character class]], modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other stats, as well as what psynergy the character can perform.<ref name=p32>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Character Classes | pages=32 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref>

In the game, Djinn can either be <U+201C>turned on<U+201D> (<U+201C>Set<U+201D>) or <U+201C>turned off<U+201D> (<U+201C>On Standby<U+201D>). When a Djinni is "Set" to a character, that Djinni exerts influence on that character<U+2019>s class<ref name=allgame>{{cite web|url=http://allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:35091|title=All Game Guide: ''Golden Sun''|work=allgame.com|accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> (and therefore, his or her statistics and Psynergy collection) relative to both the character<U+2019>s innate element and that of the Djinni<U+2019>s.<ref name=p19/> As there are twenty-eight Djinn encompassing the four elements that can be mixed and matched to the four characters in seemingly any manner, a large array of possible class setups for all four characters are potentially available, allowing a variety of combat options.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Tips | pages=50 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:GoldenSunSummon.png|frame|right|240px|Using Djinn, characters can call forth powerful elemental gods like [[Thor]] to unleash heavy damage on the opposition.]]
In combat, a player can use a Djinni during that character's turn. Each Djinni has its own special ability which can be invoked during combat. These abilities can include (but are not limited to) enhanced elemental attacks, [[Buff (MMORPG terminology)|buffing]] or debuffing spells, healing/restoration spells, and other effects. After a successful invoke, the Djinni shifts to "Standby" mode until it is "Set" on the character again.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual: Dijinn | pages=44 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> While in standby, the Djinn do not contribute to character classes, but can be used for Summon Sequences, where the player summons a powerful elemental monster. This is the game<U+2019>s most powerful method of attack, and also the riskiest, as it requires Djinn to be on Standby and therefore not be available to bolster the statistics of whatever character the Djinn are on.<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manual | pages=Appendix A | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> Once a Djinni on Standby has been used for a Summon Sequence, it must take any number of turns before it restores itself to Set position on a character. There are sixteen Summon Sequences in Golden Sun, four for each element, and each Summon Sequence takes between one and four Djinn of the same element on Standby.

==Synopsis==  
===Setting===
{{main|Weyard}}
''Golden Sun'', in both background and chain of events, takes place in a [[fantasy]] setting that may be considered fairly typical of classic-style RPGs. It is the world of "Weyard", a massive earth-like environment with several major continents and many oceans. Weyard is revealed by the game's sequel, ''[[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]]'', to be a setting modeled off the [[flat Earth]] ideal of the world; it is a flat, vaguely circular plane whose oceans perpetually spill off the edge of the world's entire perimeter into an endless abyss.<ref name="gaiafalls1">'''Male villager:''' The huge waterfall at the edge of the world is known as Gaia Falls. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun: The Lost Age |developer=Camelot Software Planning |publisher=Nintendo |date=2003-04-14 |platform=Game Boy Advance |language=English}}</ref><ref name="gaiafalls2">'''Old male villager:''' Well, at least Gaia Falls will put an end to a few silly arguments. After all, if it's got an edge and you can fall off it, the world is clearly FLAT! {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun: The Lost Age |developer=Camelot Software Planning |publisher=Nintendo |date=2003-04-14 |platform=Game Boy Advance |language=English}}</ref> The plot progression of ''Golden Sun'' spans the two largest continents in the world's central region: The Eurasian-themed main continent of Angara to the north and the more African and Middle Eastern-inspired continent of Gondowan to the south.

Weyard is a world governed by its own set of physics based on magic. All matter on Weyard consists of any combination of the four base elements: Venus (Essence of rocks and plants), Mars (Heat, fire, and lava), Jupiter (Wind and electricity), and Mercury (Water and ice).<ref>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'': A Forbidden Power Is Unleashed | pages=5<U+2013>6 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> These four building blocks of reality can be manipulated by the omnipotent force of Alchemy, which used to reign supreme in the world's ancient past. Alchemy was sealed away in the past, however, and the world in the present age has become seemingly devoid of all magic. Various individuals throughout the world, however, each demonstrate an adeptness to manipulate one of the four elements through a [[chi]]-like form of magic called Psynergy. These Adepts, as wielders of Psynergy are called, generally refrain from displaying their talents to outsiders of their various settlements.

===Characters=== 
{{main|List of characters in Golden Sun}}
The player controls a total of four characters of ''Golden Sun''. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Isaac|Isaac]] is a seventeen-year-old Venus Adept from the village of Vale, who serves as the game's [[silent protagonist]]. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Garet|Garet]], a seventeen-year-old Mars Adept also from Vale, is big and strong but slightly oafish and unfocused; nonetheless he is Isaac's closest companion. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Ivan|Ivan]] is a fifteen-year-old Jupiter Adept who has lived with a famous merchant in the town of Kalay all his life, but whose real hometown is actually Contigo, a town on the continent of Atteka; he is a somewhat quiet, insightful boy. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Mia|Mia]], a seventeen-year-old Mercury Adept from the wintry town of Imil, is a gentle healer from a heritage of Mercury Adept clansmen. A fifth character seen and playable in the game's exposition sequence is the 17-year-old Mars Adept [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Jenna|Jenna]], another childhood friend to Isaac, and Felix's Sister, in Vale.<ref name=adepts>{{cite book | year=2002 | editor=Camelot | title=''Golden Sun'' Instruction Manua: The Adepts | pages=14<U+2013>15 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref>

===Plot===
The force of Alchemy was prevalent in Weyard's ancient past, allowing for the development of great civilizations, but this eventually gave way to worldwide conflict that had subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy in the ancient past.<ref name="agesago">'''In-game text:''' Ages ago, or so the stories tell, the power of Alchemy ruled over the world of Weyard. Alchemy wrought the base elements of humanity into thriving civilizations, like lead into gold. But in time, man<U+2019>s dreams gave birth to untold strife. Dreams of endless riches, of eternal life, of dominion over all that lived<U+2026> Dreams of conquest and war. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun: The Lost Age |developer=Camelot Software Planning |publisher=Nintendo |date=2003-04-14 |platform=Game Boy Advance |language=English}}</ref> The keys to unlocking Alchemy, a quartet of magic jewels named the Elemental Stars, have been hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn has been guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base over the ages. Three years prior to the start of the game in the game's prologue, however, [[Characters of Golden Sun#Saturos and Menardi|Saturos and Menardi]] raid Mt. Aleph with the intent to take the Elemental Stars for themselves, but fail to solve the riddles guarding them and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.<ref name="sattymenny">'''Menardi:''' How could we have anticipated Sol Sanctum would unleash such fury? / '''Saturos:''' It<U+2019>s a miracle that even the two of us were spared. / '''Menardi:''' That switch<U+2026> It must have been a trap. / '''Saturos:''' But to think it could conjure up a storm this powerful! / '''Menardi:'''<U+2026>Another demonstration of the awesome powers of Alchemy. / '''Saturos:''' Regardless, we must not fail the next time we challenge Sol Sanctum. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun |developer=Camelot Software Planning |publisher=Nintendo |date=2001-11-11 |platform=Game Boy Advance |language=English}}</ref>

In the present, the teenaged adepts from Vale, [[Characters of Golden Sun#Isaac|Isaac]], [[Characters of Golden Sun#Garet|Garet]], and [[Characters of Golden Sun#Jenna|Jenna]], join [[Characters of Golden Sun#Kraden|Kraden]] in his research of Mt.

''Golden Sun'' underwent a development cycle of between twelve and eighteen months by Camelot Software Planning, which is considered quite a long period of time for the development of a handheld video game,<ref name="development-time">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=2001 | title=Import Impressions: Golden Sun | url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/097/097263p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessmonthday=January 6 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and was described as a "testament" to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game.<ref name=ignreview/> It was shown in early, playable form at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan on August 2000.<ref name="spaceworld">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=2001 | title=Golden Sun Preview | url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/135/135255p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessmonthday=January 6 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> North American previewers received the game a few weeks before the release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing ''[[Shining Force]]'' for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.<ref name=ign2prev>{{cite web|author=IGN staff|date=2001-11-2|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/099/099610p1.html|title=First Look: US Golden Sun|work=gbign.com|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

Originally, Camelot planned to create a single title instead of a series, but due to both the hardware limitations of putting it on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge and the developers' own desire for what they wanted to do with the game, it was expanded to become two successive games, ''Golden Sun'' and ''[[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]]''. Scenario writer Hiroyuki Takahashi and director Shugo Takahashi had previously designed ''[[Shining Force III]]'', where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the "good" side and the "bad" side of the characters. Thinking that it was an effective way of conveying the full story of a fictional game world, they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into the two-game setup of the ''Golden Sun'' series, having the player control the "good guys" in ''Golden Sun'' and members of the antagonistic party in ''The Lost Age''.<ref name="gameplan">{{cite web | author=Louie the Cat | year=2004 | title=Rumor: Golden Sun for Gamecube? | url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/rumorsArt.cfm?artid=4522 | publisher=Nintendo World Report | accessmonthday=January 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

''Golden Sun'' met with generally strong reviews, of which many were emphatically glowing.<ref name="reviews">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/g/game_boy_advance/golden_sun|title=Rotten Tomatoes review page|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessmonthday=July 13 |accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="reviews2">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/gba/goldensun|title=Metacritic Game Rankings page|work=Metacritic.com|accessmonthday=July 13 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Many praised the game's vibrant graphics, high-quality sound, and varied, refined RPG gameplay, with particular optimism on the Djinn-based gameplay system and Battle aspect.<ref name="goodreview1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/launchreview.asp?reviewid=59181 IGN Game Rankings review|title=Game Rankings- Golden Sun|work=Gamerankings.com|accessmonthday=July 13 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> It was also praised for being graphically stunning for the limitations of the 32-bit cartridge, with gamespot.com noting that "''Golden Sun'' is a throwback to some of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]]' best."<ref name=gamespot>{{cite web|date=2001-11-12|author=Torres, Ricardo|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/goldensun/review.html|title=Golden Sun for GBA- gamespot.com|work=gamespot.com|accessmonthday=February 1 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[G4tv.com|G4 TV]] stated "It's the best original (nonport) GBA RPG to date", while GamePro raved that ''Golden Sun'' was "A huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn<U+2019>t seem to care that it<U+2019>s 'just' on a GBA."<ref name="reviews2" />

Complaints about the game generally revolved around the overuse of text dialogue in the numerous cutscenes throughout the game, especially in the prologue, causing the game to get off to a rather cumbersome start.<ref name=ignreview /> In addition, some faulted ''Golden Sun'' for still relying on the "wander around, get into a random battle, win battle, wander around, random battle, etc." theme in many role-playing games. ''Golden Sun'' rates a 9.2/10 on [[MobyGames]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/golden-sun|title=''Golden Sun'' for GBA- Moby Games|work=mobygames.com|accessmonthday=February 2 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> and an 8.5/10 on GameInformer.com (the main complaint being low replay value, it was still titled "GBA's Golden Child").<ref>{{cite web|author=Leeper, Justin|date=2002|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200201/R03.0731.1805.25876.htm|title=Game Informer Online|work=gameinformer.com|accessmonthday=February 1 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> The game has a 91% ranking on [[Metacritic]].<ref name=mc/>
