'''Junior Woodchucks''' are the [[Scouting]] organization to which [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] belong. They have a uniform with a [[coonskin cap]]. The Junior Woodchucks were created by [[Carl Barks]] in 1951, in the story "Operation St. Bernhard" (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #125). Later stories introduced a similar organization for girls, [[The Junior Chickadees|Junior Chickadees]], to which [[Daisy Duck]]'s nieces, [[April, May and June]] belong. A hallmark of the Woodchucks are exalted titles and ranks (Huey, Dewey, and Louie being promoted to become ''Ten Star Generals'' in the 1952 story of that name) and the awarding of buckets of badges, along with severe ideals as to decorum. In this way Barks poked gentle but pointed satire at aspects of the Boy Scouts.

The Junior Woodchucks also have [[Scoutmaster]]s. This role is usually taken by Donald, or [[Launchpad McQuack]] in the [[Ducktales]] cartoon, where they also had a [[baseball]] team, which Launchpad also coached. In some Italian stories the scoutmaster is a tall, strong and wise (but that fears flight) goose called ''gran mogol'' (the great [[moghul]]), whose name is Bertie McGoose.

Junior Woodchucks always carry with them a copy of the ''Junior Woodchucks Guidebook'', a [[fictional guidebook]] filled with detailed and pertinent information about whatever country or situation the Woodchucks find themselves. Its depth of coverage is remarkable, considering that it is a small [[paperback]] [[book]].

[[Don Rosa]] wrote and drew a story regarding the origin of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, "[[Guardians of the Lost Library]]", which [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] mentioned as possibly the greatest comic book story of all time. Rosa's later story ''[[W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N.]]'' tells of how Huey, Dewey, and Louie came to join the Junior Woodchucks.

In 1971 Carl Barks drew a model sheet of the nephews, with some of the drawings showing them in their Junior Woodchuck uniforms, for the Disney studio's publications department.<ref>[http://www.seriesam.com/barks/art_dms.html#awdms_1971xxxx A Guidebook to the Carl Barks Universe (test)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Most of the early Junior Woodchucks stories appeared in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories''. They also appeared in [[Donald Duck]] and in [[Uncle Scrooge]]. In 1966, they got their own title, ''Huey, Dewey, and Louie and the Junior Woodchucks'', published by [[Gold Key Comics]] for 62 issues, and then continued by [[Whitman Comics]] for another 20 issues until 1983. The stories which Carl Barks wrote for this comic book, among the last comic book stories he scripted, were drawn by Kay Wright, John Carey and [[Tony Strobl]]. More recently [[Daan Jippes]] has been commissioned by [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]] to redraw these stories emulating Barks' style and drawing inspiration from the sketches of Barks' [[storyboard|storyboard-like]] scripts.

[[Disney Comics]] published a Junior Woodchucks four issue mini series in 1991.

Today, their stories are printed in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'', published by [[Gemstone Comics]].

Comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] once claimed, in his TV show, to have been a member of the Junior Woodchucks in his childhood.

==The Chickadees==
The ''Chickadee Patrols'', sometimes also called the ''Littlest Chickadees'', are female counterparts to the Junior Woodchucks. The Chickadees first appeared in "The Chickadee Challenge," a Carl Barks [[Donald Duck]] story in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #161 (1954). The Chickadees' Duckburg patrol is led by a brawny woman named Captain Ramrod. [[Daisy Duck]]'s nieces [[April, May, and June Duck]] are members of the Chickadees. The Chickadees are named after the [[titmouse|chickadee]], a species of small bird; the phrase "littlest chickadee" also suggests "my little chickadee", a term of endearment classically used by [[W. C. Fields]].

The Chickadee Patrols are based to some extent on the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] and the [[Campfire Girls]]. In the spirit of friendly rivalry, the [[Duckburg]] troops of the Little Chickadees and Junior Woodchucks once held a bridge-building competition, which ended in a tie.

Carl Barks wrote a poem which mentions the rivalry between the two groups:

''The world is full of clans and cults''
<br/>''Abuzz as angry bees''
<br/>''And Junior Woodchucks snapping jeers''
<br/>''At Littlest Chickadees''

==Junior Woodchucks Guidebook==
The '''''Junior Woodchucks Guidebook''''', or the '''Woodchuck book''' for short, appears to contain information and advice on every possible subject. [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] frequently consult a volume of the set to get themselves and their uncles [[Donald Duck]] and [[Scrooge McDuck]] out of dangerous situations (see [[deus ex machina]]). It was first mentioned in ''[[The Secret of Atlantis]]'' by [[Carl Barks]] in 1954. Its history was later discussed in ''[[Guardians of the Lost Library]]'' by [[Don Rosa]] in 1993.

According to the cartoonist Don Rosa, this book was written by the Guardians of the lost [[Library of Alexandria]], compiling the essence of all the knowledge that was unique to the Library. It was later found by [[Cornelius Coot]] who gave the book to his son [[Duck family (Disney)#Clinton Coot|Clinton Coot]] who, in turn, was inspired to found The Junior Woodchucks as a continuation of the Guardians of the Library.

The Woodchuck book seems almost magical in its breadth of information; it almost never fails to provide the required information and yet is small enough to fit into a Junior Woodchuck's backpack (though many stories reveal that the Guidebook consists of a great number of volumes, the full collection being stored at the Junior Woodchucks' Head quarters. However the Woodchucks have an uncanny knack for always having the right volume with them for the task at hand). In particular, the Guidebook contains information on lost treasure, a complete [[Survival skills|survival guide]], extensive historical and technical information and phrase books for various more or less common languages (like a minimal [[lizard]] phrase book), and many more. However, it does not contain information that a Junior Woodchuck is already supposed to know, such as the location of [[Cape of Good Hope]] nor does it contain information on allegedly non-existent things. (In one episode of Duck Tales, the three nephews faced a [[dragon]] and when they consulted the Guidebook, the entry on dragons read that since dragons did not exist, there was no reason to include information on them. However, in the story on which that episode was based, the guidebook did have an entry on dragons.  And, in a story which appeared in [[Uncle Scrooge]] entitled "The Golden Fleecing" the ducklings looked up the question, how to put a dragon to sleep, and found the answer, Pull the wool over his eyes. The boys then covered the dragon's eyes with the [[Golden Fleece]], which they had just discovered by going to [[Colchis]] on the [[Argo]] and obtaining it from the [[Harpies]].) On the other hand, the Guidebook does have information on Martian technology, despite the fact that in the Duck Tales universe Martians had not been discovered when the book was printed. In short, it is a minimal [[encyclopedia]] (although the subset of articles is extraordinarily well-chosen), available only to Junior Woodchucks.

Information is readily available by searching the extensive index; a key skill of a Junior Woodchuck is being able to retrieve information quickly from the Woodchuck book in the midst of a dangerous situation, such as a [[bear]] attack, an [[earthquake]], falling out of an airplane ''sans'' parachute, or being swallowed by a crocodile. 

Just as the Junior Woodchucks are based on the [[Boy Scouts of America]], their Guidebook is inspired by the [[Boy Scout Handbook]]. The real Handbook (at least in the 1950s) was the same size as the Guidebook and was believed by all Scouts to contain all necessary information. In this respect, the almost limitless and sometimes esoteric knowledge the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook offers is a gently satirical comment on the "Scout Bible", as the original ''[[Scouting For Boys]]'' by [[Baden-Powell]] was sometimes known, a book giving advice on a vast range of subjects, including "Smoking", "How The Empire Must be Held", "Courtesy To Women", and "How to Revive A Suicide"<ref>''Scouting For Boys'', 1916 edition, p 266.</ref>

That guide was the inspiration for the "Junior Woodchucks Guidebook" (''Il Manuale delle Giovani Marmotte''), a series of several Disney books with tips, advice, general culture, and curious facts about nature and life, released in Italy by [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Mondadori]] in seven volumes between 1969 and 1974, and later translated into several languages.
