{{otherships|Russian battleship Poltava|Russian battleship Chesma}}

The Russian [[battleship]] '''''Poltava''''' (Russian: <U+041F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0442><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430>) was a [[Petropavlovsk class battleship|''Petropavlovsk''-class]] [[battleship]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. She was one of eight Russian [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>1905. ''Poltava'' was built at the [[Admiralty Shipyard|Galernii Island shipyard]], one of a three-ship class. She was the only ''Petropavlovsk''-class battleship to survive the war. Her sister ships [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1897)|''Petropavlovsk'']] and [[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)|''Sevastopol'']] were both lost, ''Petropavlovsk'' sunk by a [[naval mine|mine]], and ''Sevastopol'' scuttled after the capitulation of [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]]. ''Poltava'' was sunk during the siege of Port Arthur in December of 1904, but was raised by the Japanese soon after and renamed '''''Tango''''' (<U+4E39><U+5F8C>).

She saw little combat service during her Japanese career, aside from the [[Siege of Tsingtao]]. As Japan and Imperial Russia were [[Allies of World War I|allies]] at the time, the Japanese government decided to transfer ''Tango'' back to Russia. Returned in 1916, she was renamed '''''Chesma''''' (Russian: <U+0427><U+0435><U+0441><U+043C><U+0430>). She joined the [[Red Fleet|Russian revolutionary fleet]] in October 1917, but was captured by the British, who used her as a barracks hulk to house Bolshevik prisoners. Abandoned by the British and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.

== Design ==

The first design for ''Poltava'' and her [[sister ship]]s of the [[Petropavlovsk class battleship|''Petropavlovsk'' class]] was approved in January 1891. She was to be an improved version of the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperator Nikolai I||2}}, but with most of her armament in [[barbettes]], including four {{convert|12|in|0|adj=on}} guns. The class was designed with a displacement of {{convert|10960|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} at full load.{{sfn|McLaughlin|p=85}} She had a full waterline [[Belt armor|belt]], and the upper hull featured a [[tumblehome]]. ''Imperator Nikolai I'' was chosen as a starting point for the design because of her good [[seakeeping]] and seaworthiness. Some characteristics were also copied from the {{ship|French battleship|Brennus|1891|6}} and the American {{sclass|Indiana|battleship|2}}s, such as the [[flush deck|flush-deck]] hull and ''Brennus{{'}}'' high [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]].{{sfn|Forczyk|pp=15<U+2013>16}}

Following a redesign of the class, ''Poltava'' ceased to resemble ''Imperator Nikolai I''. The armor plating was changed before construction, and plans for the armament were modified while the ship was being built. The barbettes were replaced with [[gun turrets|turrets]], including [[wing turret]]s for some of the secondary {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} guns, modeled after those on ''Brennus'', with electric hoists.{{sfn|Watts|p=43}} The propulsion was based on the machinery present on [[Russian battleship Georgii Pobedonosets|''Georgii Pobedonosets'']].{{sfn|McLaughlin|p=85}} ''Poltava'' was the first Russian battleship to use [[Krupp armor]]; her sisters used [[Harvey armor|Harvey nickel-steel armor]]. {{sfn|Forczyk|pp=15<U+2013>16}}

== Characteristics ==

''Poltava'' displaced {{convert|11400|t|LT|0}} and was {{convert|367|ft|m|1}} long [[Length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|69|ft|m|1}} and a mean [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|26|ft|6|in|m|1}}. Powered by 16 cylindrical coal-burning [[boiler (steam generator)|boilers]], she could carry {{convert|1310|LT|t}} of coal.{{sfn|Hore|p=116}} This gave her a range of {{convert|4000|nmi}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|lk=in}}.{{sfn|Watts|p=44}} She had a crew of 688.{{sfn|Watts|p=44}}

The ship's main armament consisted of a [[artillery battery|battery]] of four {{convert|12|in|0|adj=on}} guns in two twin turrets. This was supplemented by a secondary battery of twelve {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} guns. ''Poltava''{{'}}s armament was rounded out with ten {{convert|47|mm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} guns, twenty-eight {{convert|37|mm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} anti<U+2013>[[torpedo boat]] guns, and six {{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four of which were submerged.{{sfn|Hore|p=116}}

== Service history ==

[[File:Battleship Poltava in Kronstadt, Russia - Autumn 1898.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Poltava'' at [[Kronstadt]], Russia, in 1898]]
''Poltava'' was laid down on 7 May 1892, at the [[Admiralty Shipyard|Galernii Island shipyard]], launched on 25 October 1894, and commissioned on 18 August 1896. Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899. She was then assigned to the [[Baltic Fleet]]. As no conflicts were ongoing at this time, ''Poltava'' did not participate in any combat roles.{{sfn|Taras|p=24}}

On 3 October 1900, ''Poltava'' and her sister ship ''Sevastopol'' set sail to Port Arthur, where they arrived on 13 April 1901 and were incorporated into the [[First Pacific Squadron]]. As Russia was at peace at this time, ''Poltava'' did not participate in any combat roles.{{sfn|McLaughlin|p=91}}

=== Russo-Japanese War ===

[[File:Battleships Petropavlosk, Sevastopol and Poltava.jpg|thumb|left|''Poltava'' (front right) and her sisters|alt=A black and white shot of three large ships near a hill-like background, with several small skiffs in the foreground.]]

On 8 February 1904, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a [[Battle of Port Arthur|surprise attack]] on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. ''Poltava'' was hit once on her aft hull, but sustained no casualties. In response to the attack, Poltava turned in pursuit along with other ships of the Russian fleet, all firing their forward guns, but she failed to score any hits.{{sfn|Balakin|p=30}} She went back to port and remained there for the next six months with the rest of the fleet. The fleet attempted to breakout several times, but ''Poltava'' did not participate in any of efforts.{{sfn|Taras|pp=26<U+2013>50}}

On 9 August the Imperial Japanese Army, which had been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur, began an assault on the city's outer defenses. With their base now directly under attack, the First Pacific Squadron sortied from its base in an attempt to escape to [[Vladivostok]] in the morning, around 07:00.{{sfn|Watts|p=21}} They were intercepted by the Japanese fleet in what became the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] at 12:55.{{sfn|Watts|p=21}}

''Poltava'' was sixth in the column of Russian ships when the Japanese engaged them, and from her position started to bombard the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Asahi||2}} at around 14:45. {{ship|Japanese battleship| Mikasa||2}}, the Japanese flagship, then fired several shots that hit ''Poltava'', causing the Russian squadron to drop back to support her. The Russians scored several hits on ''Mikasa'', including two from shots fired by ''Poltava''. ''Poltava'' also scored one hit on the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}. Owing to the damage ''Mikasa'' had sustained, the Japanese fleet broke off the attack at around 15:20 and turned to starboard, opening the range. By 17:35 the Japanese were again closing on the Russian tail end. ''Mikasa'' and three other battleships opened fire on ''Poltava'' and three armored cruisers, but problems with their turrets forced the Japanese battleships to break off the engagement. They returned at 18:30, with the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Shikishima||2}} and ''Asahi'' firing on ''Poltava''. As the Russian fleet began to slip away, two 12-inch shells from ''Asahi'' penetrated the [[conning tower]] of the Russian flagship {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, killing Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], the commander of the First Pacific Squadron, and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind ''Tsesarevich'', including ''Poltava'', to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. Second in command of the squadron, Prince Pavel Ukhtomski, who was on the [[Russian battleship Peresvyet|''Peresvyet'']], signaled the other Russian ships via [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] to steam back to Port Arthur. The signals were only gradually recognized by ''Pobeda'', ''Sevastopol'', ''Pallada'' and ''Poltava''. The ''Poltava'' was hit by twelve 14-inch and eight 12-inch shells during the battle, killing 12 and wounding 43.{{sfn|Forczyk|pp=49<U+2013>52}}

Returning to Port Arthur on 10 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the [[Japanese Third Army]] led by [[Baron]] [[Nogi Maresuke]]. The squadron remained safely inside the port until 5 December, when the Third Army captured [[203 Hill|203 Meter Hill]], a crucial position overlooking the harbor. From there, the Japanese were able to fire on ''Poltava'' and other ships of the First Pacific Squadron that had survived the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The ships at that time were about {{convert|5.7|km|mi|sp=us}} away from the hill, placing them within range of Japanese artillery. By 9 December, 1904, the Japanese had sunk four battleships and two cruisers, including ''Poltava''.{{sfn|Forczyk|p=54}}

===Japanese career===
Following the capture of Port Arthur, Japanese engineers raised ''Poltava'' on 8 July 1905, repaired her, and commissioned her as the ''Tango'', taking her name from the [[old provinces of Japan|ancient Japanese province]] of [[Tango Province|Tango]], now a part of [[Kyoto-fu]].{{sfn|Taras|p=24}}She was the only ship of her class still afloat, as her sister ships [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1897)|''Petropavlovsk'']] and [[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)|''Sevastopol'']] were both lost, ''Petropavlovsk'' sunk by a [[naval mine|mine]], and ''Sevastopol'' scuttled after the capitulation of Port Arthur.{{sfn|McLaughlin|pp=91<U+2013>93}}  She was refitted at [[Maizuru Naval Arsenal]] from 1908<U+2013>1909, and was re-classified as a 1st class Coastal Defence Vessel.{{sfn|Taras|p=24}} She saw little combat service during her Japanese career, aside from the [[Siege of Tsingtao]] against the [[Imperial German Navy]]. As Japan and Russia were [[Allies of World War I|allies in World War I]], the Japanese government decided that ''Tango'' should be transferred back to Russia. {{sfn|McLaughlin|p=92}}

===Return to Russia===
She was transferred in early 1916, arriving at [[Vladivostok]] on 21 March 1916, where she was renamed ''Chesma'' (her original name had been re-used for a [[Russian battleship Poltava (1911)|dreadnought launched in 1911]]). She then set sail for the Mediterranean, arriving at [[Port Said]] on 6 September to join the Allied fleet off [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] demanding the disarmament of the Greek fleet. Her machinery was overhauled at [[Birkenhead]], an English port, on 22 November, and she arrived at Aleksandrovsk, a port in the [[Murmansk Oblast]], on 3 January 1917. She joined the [[Red Fleet|Revolutionary fleet]] in October of the same year.{{sfn|Taras|p=24}} After the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied invasion]] in early 1918, the ship was captured by the [[Royal Navy]], who described her as "aground and unseaworthy". She was used as a floating prison to house 40 [[Bolshevik]] prisoners. After the British withdrew, the ship was instated into the Bolshevik White Sea Military Flotilla. She was turned over to the port of [[Archangelsk]] on 16 June 1921 and stricken from the [[navy list|list of naval vessels]] on 3 July 1924, after which she was scrapped.{{sfn|McLaughlin|p=91}}
