The '''Silesian Offensives''' were two offensives by the [[Red Army]] in its fight against the [[Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]. The [[Lower Silesian Offensive Operation]] lasted from [[8 February|8]] to [[24 February]] [[1945]], and [[Upper Silesian Offensive Operation]] lasted from [[15 March|15]] to [[31 March]] 1945. Designed to flank Soviet main advance on Berlin, both attacks pushed the ''Wehrmacht'' from [[Silesia]].

The [[1st Ukrainian Front]] under [[Ivan Konev]]<U+2019>s command, having completed the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]], was to advance westward toward [[Silesia]] region with the primary aim of protecting the left flank of [[1st Belorussian Front]], which was pushing towards [[Berlin]]. Similarly, the [[East Pomeranian Offensive]] of [[2nd Belorussian Front]] in the north was designed to protecd the 1st Belorussian front right flank. The need to secure the flanks delayed [[Battle of Berlin|the Soviets final push towards Berlin]], which was originally planned for February, to April. By mid-April, the East Pomeranian Offensive <U+2014> carried by 2nd and elements of the 1st Belorussian Fronts <U+2014> had succeeded in its objectives, reaching an important port town of [[Szczecin]] (Settin). [[Stalin]]'s decision to delay the push towards Berlin from February to April has been a subject of some controversy among both the Soviet generals and military historians, with one side arguing that the Soviets had a chance of securing Berlin much quicker and with much lower losses in February, and the other arguing that the danger of leaving large German formations on the flanks could have resulted in a successful German counterattack and prolonged the war further. It is likely that Stalin's aim was political, as the delay allowed him to occupy significant parts of [[Austria]] ([[Vienna Offensive]]).
