'''''A Journey''''' is a [[memoir]] by [[Tony Blair]] of his tenure as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. Published in the UK on 1 September 2010, it covers events from when he [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|became leader]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1994 and transformed it into "New Labour", holding power for a party record [[Premiership of Tony Blair|three successive terms]], to his [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|resignation and replacement]] as Prime Minister by his [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]]. Blair donated his <U+00A3>4.6m [[Advance against royalties|advance]], and all subsequent [[royalties]], to the [[British Armed Forces]] charity [[The Royal British Legion]]. It became the fastest-selling autobiography of all time at the bookstore chain Waterstones. Promotional events were marked by antiwar protests.

Two of the book's major topics are the strains in Blair's relationship with Brown after allegedly reneging on the pair's [[Blair<U+2013>Brown deal|1994 agreement]] to step down as Prime Minister much earlier, and his [[Opposition to the Iraq War|controversial decision]] to participate in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Blair discusses Labour's future after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], his relations with the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], and how he came to respect [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.

Gordon Brown was reportedly unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of ''[[The London Review of Books]]'' suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled relationship with his Chancellor that were absent from ''A Journey''. Labour politician [[Alistair Darling]] said the book demonstrates how the country can be changed for the better when a government has a clear purpose, while the ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Families of servicemen and servicewomen who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of ''A Journey'', the screenwriter of the 2006 film ''[[The Queen (film)|The Queen]]'', which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with [[Elizabeth II]] from him.

From the outset Blair's government plays a significant role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], during which Blair admits to using "a certain amount of creative ambiguity" to secure an agreement,<ref>{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=David|title=Tony Blair: Northern Ireland peace is an inspiration to the world|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/tony-blair-northern-ireland-peace-is-an-inspiration-to-the-world-14933852.html|accessdate=9 November 2010|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|publisher=Independent News and Media|date=4 September 2010}}</ref> claiming the process would not have succeeded otherwise.

One of the themes that dominates the latter part of Blair's time in office is his decision to join [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W.

Several days after the launch of the book, Blair appeared on the [[series premiere]] of ITV1's breakfast television programme ''[[Daybreak (ITV)|Daybreak]]'', where he criticised the Dublin protestors as a small minority given undue media attention. Since the book was selling well, and given fears that protesters would also be present at a forthcoming book signing in London on 8 September, he expressed doubts over whether that event was justifiable or worth the inevitable disruption.<ref name=Telegraph6Sep2010PMMayCancel>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/tony-blair/7983792/Tony-Blair-memoirs-former-PM-may-cancel-book-signing-amid-security-fears.html|title=Tony Blair memoirs: former PM may cancel book signing amid security fears|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|publisher= Telegraph Media Group|first= Andrew|last= Hugh|date=6 September 2010|accessdate=6 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100907185856/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/tony-blair/7983792/Tony-Blair-memoirs-former-PM-may-cancel-book-signing-amid-security-fears.html| archivedate= 7 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Later in the day it was confirmed the signing at Waterstones in [[Piccadilly]] would not go ahead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Blair cancels book signing amid protest fears|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11197376|accessdate=15 November 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=6 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/06/tony-blair-cancels-london-book-signing|title= Tony Blair scrapped London book signing to avoid protest 'hassle'|newspaper= The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|first= Alexandra|last= Topping|date= 6 September 2010|accessdate= 6 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100908013405/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/06/tony-blair-cancels-london-book-signing| archivedate= 8 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> A spokesman for Blair announced that a planned launch party for the book scheduled for the [[Tate Modern]] would take place despite plans by the [[Stop the War Coalition]] to demonstrate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/blairs-secret-launch-party-go-ahead-despite-protests.html|title= Blair's 'secret' launch party to go ahead despite protests|newspaper= The Bookseller|publisher= Bookseller Media Ltd|date= 7 September 2010|accessdate= 7 September 2010}}</ref> However, the following day this event was also cancelled as a result of threats of disruption by campaigners.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/08/tony-blair-book-party-cancelled|title= Tony Blair book launch party cancelled|newspaper= The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|first= H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne|last= Mulholland|date= 8 September 2010|accessdate= 8 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100911215043/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/08/tony-blair-book-party-cancelled| archivedate= 11 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In subsequent weeks, a number of media organisations reported that copies of ''A Journey'' were being moved from autobiographical sections in bookshops to sections on crime and horror.<ref name="SkyCrimeMove">{{cite news|last=Pearse|first=Damien|title=Blair Book's Journey To Crime Section|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Tony-Blair-Book-A-Journey-Shifted-To-Fantasy-Section-In-Bookshops-As-Part-Of-Facebook-Campaign/Article/201009115713873?f=rss|accessdate=13 November 2010|work=Sky News|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|date=4 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="IndyCrimeMove"/><ref name="GuardianCrimeMove">{{cite news|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|title=Looking for Tony Blair's memoir?

==Reception==

===In the United Kingdom===

''A Journey'' drew a mixed reception from critics. ''[[Financial Times]]'' editor [[Lionel Barber]] called it "part psychodrama, part treatise on the frustrations of leadership in a modern democracy ... written in a chummy style with touches of [[Mills & Boon]]". He wrote that it made Blair seem "likable, if manipulative; capable of dissembling while wonderfully fluent; in short, a brilliant modern politician (whatever his moans about the media)."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c2cc9b08-b6e9-11df-b3dd-00144feabdc0.html|title= Tony Blair: A Journey|newspaper= Financial Times|publisher=Pearson PLC|first= Lionel|last= Barber|format=subscription required|date= 3 September 2010|accessdate= 5 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100904192639/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c2cc9b08-b6e9-11df-b3dd-00144feabdc0.html| archivedate= 4 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Writing in ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]'', Geoffrey Beattie said ''A Journey'' offered an understanding of Blair's "underlying psychology."<ref name=Beattie>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/inside-the-mind-of-tony-blair-2070838.html|title= Inside the mind of Tony Blair|newspaper=The Independent on Sunday|publisher= Independent Print Ltd|first= Geoffrey|last= Beattie|date= 5 September 2010|accessdate= 5 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100906154627/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/inside-the-mind-of-tony-blair-2070838.html| archivedate= 6 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[John Rentoul]], author of the Blair biography ''Tony Blair Prime Minister'', was equally positive, giving particular praise to the chapter on the Iraq War.

Other reviewers were less positive. The political journalist and author [[Andrew Rawnsley]] was critical of Blair's writing style in ''[[The Observer]]''. "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," he wrote. "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but he can be a ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated."<ref name=Rawnsley>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review|title= Tony Blair's A Journey: Andrew Rawnsley's verdict|first= Andrew|last= Rawnsley|newspaper= The Observer|publisher= Guardian Media Group|date= 5 September 2010|accessdate= 5 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100906220157/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review| archivedate= 6 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Julian Glover, a columnist in ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream<U+2014>or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience.

===In the United States===
Reviews in the U.S. sounded similar themes. In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', British novelist [[John Lanchester]] called ''A Journey'' "a detailed account of scrambling, scraping, horse-trading, bluffing, and fudging the way to a deal<U+2014>a remarkable combination of the ramshackle and the historic."<ref>{{cite news|last=Lanchester|first=John|title=The Which Blair Project|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/09/13/100913crbo_books_lanchester?currentPage=all|accessdate=10 November 2010|newspaper=The New Yorker|publisher= Cond<U+00E9> Nast|date=13 September 2010}}</ref> [[Fareed Zakaria]] of the ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' praised Blair for his openness in the publication. "When speaking about the challenges of his first term in office, Blair writes honestly and openly," the newspaper said. "The style is not the elegant Oxbridge prose that might have been expected of a former prime minister but one filled with Americanisms. It is breezy, informal and candid enough to keep the reader thoroughly engaged."<ref name=NYTreview/> However, Zakaria attacked Blair's "sweeping generalizations" about terrorism.<ref name=NYTreview>{{cite news|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|title=The Convert|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/Zakaria-t.html|accessdate=10 December 2010|newspaper=The New York Times Book Review|publisher= The New York Times Company|date=8 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101110103928/http://www10.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/books/review/Zakaria-t.html| archivedate= 10 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Leonard Downie, Jr.]], former editor of that paper, called the work a "notably wistful memoir" and is generally positive about its content: "Toward the end of this well-written and perhaps unintentionally self-revealing memoir, Tony Blair, who was Britain's prime minister during an eventful decade from 1997 to 2007, insists he is "trying valiantly not to fall into self-justifying mode<U+2014>a bane of political memoirs."

===Internationally===

There are fewer reviews from newspapers outside the United Kingdom and United States, but those available are generally positive. Writing for Australia's ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' [[Alexander Downer]], who served as Foreign Minister in the [[Howard Government|Government of John Howard]] gave ''A Journey'' a favourable review: "His [Blair's] commitment to humanity is sincere and convincing, and his personality infectiously amiable with a delightful sense of self-deprecating humour."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/tony-blair-a-journey-20101001-160py.html|title= Tony Blair: A Journey|first= Alexander|last= Downer|publisher= Fairfax Media|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 1 October 2010|accessdate= 29 May 2012}}</ref> Konrad Yakabuski, a senior political writer for Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' was also positive: "If Tony Blair has not continued to agonize over the tough decisions of his prime ministership, he does a pretty good job of persuading otherwise in A Journey."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-249311312.html|title=Book Review: Blair, Tony: A Journey: My Political Life|first= Konrad|last= Yakabuski|publisher= The Globe and Mail Inc|newspaper= The Globe and Mail|format=subscription required|date= 11 September 2010|accessdate= 8 June 2012}}</ref> India's English language daily ''[[The Hindu]]'' said of the book, "It is by no means a confessional memoir but a brave attempt with only patchy success at self-justification."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article1080458.ece|title= Blair has a story for Indians|publisher= Kasturi and Sons Ltd|newspaper= The Hindu|first=M.

The Queen reportedly felt a "profound sense of disappointment" in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing in his memoirs sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister.{{efn|It is generally accepted that a Prime Minister does not discuss details of conversations he has with the Sovereign.<ref name=Telegraph-2010-09-03/>}} A spokesman for [[Buckingham Palace]] told the newspaper, "No prime minister before has ever done this and we can only hope that it will never happen again."<ref name=Telegraph-2010-09-03>{{cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/7978415/The-Queen-is-not-amused-by-Tony-Blairs-indiscretions.html|title= The Queen is not amused by Tony Blair's indiscretions|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|publisher= Telegraph Media Group|first= Tim|last= Walker|date= 3 September 2010|accessdate= 5 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100906145131/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/7978415/The-Queen-is-not-amused-by-Tony-Blairs-indiscretions.html| archivedate= 6 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The ''[[Sunday Express]]'' claimed, quoting "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" and other "Royal insiders", that due to the book's contents, Elizabeth&nbsp;II would withhold granting Blair the [[Order of the Thistle]], an [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honour]] which is bestowed on the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office.<ref name=Express5Sep2010QueensSnub>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/197595/Queen-s-snub-to-Tony-Blair-by-withholding-honour|last=Giannangell|first=Marco|title=Queen's snub to Tony Blair by withholding Honour|newspaper=Sunday Express|publisher= Northern and Shell Media|date=5 September 2010|accessdate=6 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100908053416/http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/197595/Queen-s-snub-to-Tony-Blair-by-withholding-honour| archivedate= 8 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Gordon Brown was said to be "seething" and "dismayed" over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it.<ref name=Independent3September2010>{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/seething-brown-claims-moral-high-ground-ndash-but-will-not-attack-his-old-ally-2069230.html|title= 'Seething' Brown claims moral high ground&nbsp;<U+2013> but will not attack his old ally|newspaper= The Independent|publisher= Independent Print Ltd|first= Andrew|last= Grice|date= 3 September 2010|accessdate= 7 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100905150758/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/seething-brown-claims-moral-high-ground-ndash-but-will-not-attack-his-old-ally-2069230.html| archivedate= 5 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Ed Balls]], a Brown ally who served in [[Brown ministry|his government]] as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations.

Several more of Blair's former colleagues and political opponents also commented on the book. Former [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative]] minister [[Norman Tebbit]] wrote in ''The Daily Telegraph'', "''A Journey'' seems to be dominated by Blair's anxiety to be seen as a great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100052530/tony-blair-didnt-save-the-labour-party-he-crucified-it-and-this-country/|title= Tony Blair didn't save the Labour Party: he crucified it, and this country|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|first= Norman|last= Tebbit|date= 6 September 2010|accessdate= 7 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100909122530/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/normantebbit/100052530/tony-blair-didnt-save-the-labour-party-he-crucified-it-and-this-country/| archivedate= 9 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Writing in ''The Guardian'', [[Alistair Darling]], who was Chancellor under [[Premiership of Gordon Brown|Gordon Brown]], said that he "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor.

Of Blair, he said, "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful lot longer than he was unpopular."<ref name="GuardianLiveReaction">{{cite news|last=Sparrow|first=Andrew|title=Tony Blair's A Journey memoir released&nbsp;<U+2013> live blog|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2010/sep/01/tonyblair-past|accessdate=17 November 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=1 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101126020537/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2010/sep/01/tonyblair-past| archivedate= 26 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Ed Miliband]], then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page.

Some of the dialogue Blair uses to describe his first meeting with Elizabeth&nbsp;II led to accusations of plagiarism from [[Peter Morgan (screenwriter)|Peter Morgan]], who wrote ''[[The Queen (film)|The Queen]]'', set during the first few months of Blair's premiership. Blair recalls his first meeting with Elizabeth&nbsp;II in which she tells him, "You are my 10th prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born." In the film, [[Helen Mirren]]'s fictionalised Elizabeth&nbsp;II says almost exactly the same thing.<ref name=blairTheQueenpla/><ref>{{cite news |title=In Blair Memoir, Is It the Queen or 'The Queen'?|first=David |last=Itzkoff |newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=8 September 2010|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/in-blair-memoir-is-it-the-queen-or-the-queen/|accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref> Morgan said it had been purely his own imagination.<ref name=blairTheQueenpla>{{cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7987064/Peter-Morgan-accuses-Tony-Blair-of-plagiarising-lines-from-his-film-The-Queen.html|title= Peter Morgan accuses Tony Blair of plagiarising lines from his film The Queen|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|first= Tim|last= Walker|date= 8 September 2010|accessdate= 9 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100909153931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7987064/Peter-Morgan-accuses-Tony-Blair-of-plagiarising-lines-from-his-film-The-Queen.html| archivedate= 9 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Other accounts of the Blair years==

Some commentators offered comparisons between ''A Journey'' and accounts of the Blair years written by other senior members of his government, particularly on Blair's relationship with Gordon Brown. David Goodhart of ''[[Prospect Magazine]]'' wrote that in both Peter Mandelson<U+2019>s memoir ''The Third Man'' and the first volume of [[Alastair Campbell]]<U+2019>s Diaries (1994-97), "Blair is important, but a rather weak figure buffeted by events and by Gordon Brown. In Blair<U+2019>s own account, A Journey (in which Mandelson features hardly at all, and Gordon Brown only at the end) it is of course very different. Almost everything is driven forward by him; the new Labour project was not imminent in Britain<U+2019>s political history<U+2014>it had to be shaped and moulded."<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodhart |first=David |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/tony-blair-journey/ |title=The leader we deserved |publisher=Prospect Publishing |work=Prospect Magazine |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> A similar theme was echoed by David Runciman in ''The London Review of Books'', where he reflected that Mandelson's memoirs "provide a much more complete account of the Blair/Brown relationship", including details of ''Operation Teddy Bear'', an aborted plot from 2003 to curb Brown's increasing influence as Chancellor by dividing the Treasury to create a separate Office of Budget and Delivery that would be controlled directly by the [[Cabinet Office]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Runciman |first=David |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/david-runciman/preacher-on-a-tank |title=Preacher on a Tank |date=7 October 2010 |work=London Review of Books |publisher=Nicholas Spice |accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref>

Writing for the journal ''British Politics'', academic Mark Garnett provided a detailed analysis of the Blair and Mandelson memoirs, observing that while ''A Journey'' gives a more in-depth account of what he termed "contemporary British government", ''The Third Man'' is a more satisfying read: "''The Third Man'' was a worthwhile effort for Peter Mandelson's reputation, while Tony Blair has journeyed in vain."<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.palgrave-journals.com/bp/journal/v6/n3/abs/bp201116a.html|title= Cash for quotations: The memoirs of Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair| first= Mark|last= Garnett|journal= British Politics, Vol 6|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year= 2011)|page= 397<U+2013>404|format=subscription required|accessdate= 23 June 2012}}</ref> The ''New Zealand Listener'', on the other hand, suggested that ''A Journey'' and other memoirs written by prominent architects of New Labour had helped to seal its doom after [[David Miliband]] <U+2013> the preferred candidate of all three as Brown's successor <U+2013> failed to be elected to the position: "All three backed David Miliband, and however much Miliband tried to distance himself <U+2013> I<U+2019>m not New Labour, I<U+2019>m Next Labour <U+2013> these three books and the publicity that surrounded them showed he had New Labour dye all over his hands. David was beaten to the leadership by his younger brother, Ed (a man who lacked, as Blair himself might put it, the New Labour baggage), by a whisker <U+2013> just over 1%. And at a stroke, it<U+2019>s clear these great, vocal proselytisers of New Labour have unwittingly written its epitaph."<ref>{{cite news|last=Manhire |first=Toby |url=http://www.listener.co.nz/culture/books/journeys-end-3/ |title=Journey<U+2019>s end |work=New Zealand Listener |publisher=APN News and Media |date=16 October 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref>
