Throughout the [[Soviet history]] millions of people became victims of 
'''Soviet political repression''', which in various degrees was an instrument of the internal [[politics of the Soviet Union|politics of the Soviet Russia and Soviet Union]] since the first days after the [[October Revolution]]. Culminating during the [[Great Purge]], it still existed during the "[[Khrushchev Thaw]]," followed by increased persecution of [[Soviet dissidents]] during [[Brezhnev stagnation]], and didn't cease to exist even during [[Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]]. Its heritage still  influences the life of the  modern [[Russia]].

==Origins and early Soviet times==

{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}
Early on the theoretical basis of the repressions was the [[Marxist]] view at the [[class struggle]] and the resulting notion of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. Its legal basis was formalized into the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|Article 58 ]] in the code of [[RSFSR]] and similar articles for other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s. 

The term "[[repression]]", "[[terror]]", and other strong words were normal working terms with respect to the internal politics of the early Soviet state, reflecting the fact that the dictatorship of the proletariat was supposed apply ruthless force to suppress the resistance of the [[social class]]es which Marxism considered antagonistic to the class of [[proletariat]]. This phraseology was gradually abolished after [[destalinization]], but the system of persecution for political views and activities remained until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

At times, the the victims were called the [[enemies of the people]]. Punishments by the state included [[summary execution]]s, [[torture]], sending innocent people to [[Gulag]], [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]], and [[Lishenets|stripping of citizen's rights]]. Sometimes, all members of a family, including children, were punished as "[[NKVD Order <U+2116> 00486|traitor of Motherland family members]]". Repression was conducted by the [[Cheka]], [[OGPU]] and [[NKVD]] in several consecutive waves known as [[Red Terror]], [[Collectivisation in the USSR|Collectivisation]], the [[Great Purge]]s, the [[Doctor's Plot]], and others. The [[secret police]] forces conducted [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacres of prisoners]] on numerous occasions.  Repression was practiced in the [[Soviet republics]] and in the territories liberated by [[Soviet Army]] during [[World War II]], including [[Baltic States]] and [[Eastern Europe]] <ref>[[Anton Antonov-Ovseenko]] ''[[Beria]]'' (Russian) Moscow, AST, 1999. [http://fictionbook.ru/author/antonov_ovseenko_anton/beriya/antonov_ovseenko_beriya.html Russian text online] </ref>.

State repression led to resistnace, which were brutally suppressed by military force, such as the [[Tambov rebellion]], [[Kronstadt rebellion]], and [[Vorkuta Uprising]]. During the Tambov rebellion, [[Bolshevik]] military forces used [[chemical weapons]] against villages with civilian population and rebels.<ref name="Tambov"> [http://gulag.ipvnews.org/article20061017.php B.V.Sennikov.

==Red Terror==
{{main|Red Terror}}

Red Terror in Soviet Russia was the campaign of mass arrests and [[execution]]s conducted by the [[Bolshevik]] government. The Red Terror was officially announced on [[September 2]], [[1918]] by [[Yakov Sverdlov]] and ended in about October 1918. However [[Sergei Melgunov]] applies this term to repressions for the whole period of the [[Russian Civil War]], 1918-1922.<ref name="Melgunov">[[Sergei Melgunov|Serge Petrovich Melgunov]], ''Red Terror in Russia'', Hyperion Pr (1975), ISBN 0-883-55187-X</ref><ref name="Black"/>

==Collectivization==
{{main|Collectivization in the USSR}}

Collectivization in the [[Soviet Union]] was a policy, pursued between 1928 and 1933, to consolidate individual land and labour into [[collective farm]]s ({{lang-ru|<U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0445><U+043E><U+0301><U+0437>}}, ''[[kolkhoz]]'', plural ''kolkhozy''). <!--and into state farms ({{lang-ru|<U+0441><U+043E><U+0432><U+0445><U+043E><U+0301><U+0437>}}, ''[[sovkhoz]]'').--> The Soviet leaders were confident that the replacement of individual peasant farms by kolkhozy would immediately increase food supplies for the urban population, the supply of raw materials for processing industry, and agricultural exports generally. Collectivization was thus regarded as the solution to the crisis in agricultural distribution (mainly in grain deliveries) that had developed since 1927 and was becoming more acute as the Soviet Union pressed ahead with its ambitious industrialization program.<ref>Davies, R.W., ''The Soviet Collective Farms, 1929-1930,'' Macmillan, London (1980), p. 1.</ref> As peasantry, with exception of the poorest part, resisted the collectivization policy, the Soviet government resorted to the harsh measures to force the farmers to collectivize. In his conversation with [[Winston Churchill]] Stalin gave his estimate of the number of "[[kulak]]s" who were repressed for resisting [[collectivization]] as 10 million, including those forcibly deported.<ref>Valentin Berezhkov, "Kak ya stal perevodchikom Stalina", Moscow, DEM, 1993, ISBN 5-85207-044-0. p. 317</ref><ref>Stanislav Kulchytsky, [http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/420/36833/  "How many of us perished in Holodomor in 1933"], ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]'', November 23-29, 2002.</ref>

By Robert Gellately. 2007. Knopf. 720 pages ISBN 1400040051</ref> It involved the [[purge of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], repression of [[kulaks|peasants]], deportations of [[ethnic minorities]], and the persecution of unaffiliated persons, characterized by widespread police surveillance, widespread suspicion of "saboteurs", imprisonment, and killings.<ref name="Figes"/> Estimates of the number of deaths associated with the Great Purge run from the official figure of 681,692 to nearly 2 million.

==Democide, ethnic cleansing, and population transfers==
{{main|Population transfer in the Soviet Union}}

In Soviet Union, political repressions targeted not only individual persons, but also whole ethnic, social, religious, and other categories of population.

Population transfer in the Soviet Union may be classified into the following broad categories: deportations of "[[anti-Soviet]]" categories of population, often classified as "[[enemies of workers]]", deportations of nationalities, labor force transfer, and organized migrations in opposite directions to fill the [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] territories. In most cases their destinations were underpopulated remote areas, see [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]].

Entire nations and ethnic groups have been collectively punished by the Soviet Government  for alleged collaboration with the enemy during [[World War II]]. At least nine of distinct ethnic-linguistic groups, including [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|ethnic Germans]], ethnic [[Greeks]], [[Polish minority in the Soviet Union|ethnic Poles]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Balkars]], [[Chechen people|Chechen]]s, and [[Kalmyk deportations of 1944|Kalmyks]], were deported to remote unpopulated areas of [[Siberia]] (see [[sybirak]]) and [[Kazakhstan]]. [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]] led to millions of deaths due to the inflicted hardships.<ref name="Conquest">[[Robert Conquest]] (1986) ''The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine.'' [[Oxford University Press]]. ISBN 0-19-505180-7. </ref>[[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|Koreans]] and [[Deportation of Romanians in the Soviet Union|Romanians]] were also deported. [[Mass operations of the NKVD]] were needed to [[deport]] hundreds of thousands of people.

The [[Soviet famine of 1932-1933]] was severely aggravated by the actions of the [[government of the Soviet Union]], such as confiscation of food no meet the planned delivery amounts with disregard of the circumstances, blocking the migration of starving population, and the suppression of the information about the famine, which prevented any organization of relief. This had lead to deaths of millions of people in the affected area.<ref name="Conquest"/>.

==Gulag==
{{main|Gulag}}
''[[Gulag: A History]]'', by [[Anne Applebaum]],<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/acmart/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780767900560 Gulag: A History, by Anne Applebaum]</ref> explains: "It was the branch of the [[NKVD|State Security]] that operated the penal system of [[Labor camp|forced labour camps]] and associated detention and transit camps and prisons. While these camps housed criminals of all types, the Gulag system has become primarily known as a place for [[political prisoners]] and as a mechanism for repressing political opposition to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet state]].<U+201D>

==Repressions in Baltic countries==
{{main|Occupation_of_Baltic_States#Soviet_terror}}
The [[Baltic countries]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as the result of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet Pact]] and its [[s:Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact#Secret Additional Protocol|Secret Additional Protocol]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-37317/Latvia The Soviet occupation and incorporation] at [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]</ref> 

The repressions followed with the mass [[deportations]] carried out by the Soviets. [[Order <U+2116> 001223]], ''"On the Procedure for carrying out the Deportation of Anti-Soviet Elements from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia"'', contained detailed instructions for procedures and protocols to observe in the deportation of Baltic nationals. Public tribunals were also set up to punish "traitors to the people": those who had fallen short of the "political duty" of voting their countries into the USSR. In the first year of Soviet occupation, from June 1940 to June 1941, the number confirmed executed, conscripted, or deported is estimated at a minimum of 124,467: 59,732 in Estonia, 34,250 in Latvia, and 30,485 in Lithuania.<ref>Dunsdorfs, Edgars. ''The Baltic Dilemma''. Speller & Sons, New York. 1975</ref> This included 8 former heads of state and 38 ministers from Estonia, 3 former heads of state and 15 ministers from Latvia, and the then president, 5 prime ministers and 24 other ministers from Lithuania.<ref>K<U+00FC>ng, Andres. ''Communism and Crimes against Humanity in the Baltic States''. 1999 [http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm]</ref>

==Post-Stalin era (1953-1991)==

After Stalin's death, the suppression of dissent was dramatically reduced and took new forms. The internal critics of the system were convicted for [[anti-Soviet agitation]], [[Anti-Soviet slander]], or as [[Parasitism (social offense)|"social parasites"]].  Others were labeled as mentally ill, having [[sluggishly progressing schizophrenia]] and incarcerated in "[[psikhushka]]s", i.e. [[mental hospital]]s used by the Soviet authorities as prisons<ref name="Psyche"> [http://hrw.org/reports/2002/china02/china0802-02.htm#P397_91143 The Soviet Case: Prelude to a Global Consensus on Psychiatry and Human Rights. Human Rights Watch. 2005]</ref>. A number of notable dissidents, including [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], and [[Andrei Sakharov]], were sent to internal or external exile.

==Loss of life==
The exact number of victims may never be known and remains a matter of debate among historians. The published results vary depending on the time when the estimate was made, on the criteria and methods used for the estimates, and sources available for estimates. Some historians attempt to make separate estimates for different periods of the Soviet history. For example, the number of victims under [[Stalinism|Joseph Stalin's regime]] vary from 8 to 61 million <ref name="Ponton">Ponton, G.
