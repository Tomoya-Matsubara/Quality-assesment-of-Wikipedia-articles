'''2-Ethylhexanol''' (abbreviated 2-EH) is a [[fatty alcohol]], an organic compound is a branched, eight-carbon [[chiral]] [[alcohol]].  It is a colorless liquid that is nearly insoluble in water but soluble in most organic solvents.  It is produced on a massive scale as a precursor to plasticizers, some of which are controversial as potential [[endocrine disruptor]]s.

==Applications==
Almost all 2-ethylhexanol is converted into the di[[ester]]s [[bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]] (DEHP), a [[plasticizer]]. Because it is a [[fatty alcohol]], its [[ester]]s tend to have [[emollient]] properties.  For example, the [[sunscreen]] [[octocrylene]] contains a 2-ethylhexyl ester for this purpose.  It is also commonly used as a low volatility [[solvent]].

==Industrial production==
2-Ethylhexanol is produced industrially by the [[aldol condensation]] of ''n''-[[butyraldehyde]], followed by hydrogenation of the resulting hydroxyaldehyde. About 2,500,000 tons are prepared in this way annually.<ref name=aliphald>C. Kohlpaintner, M. Schulte, J. Falbe, P. Lappe, J. Weber, "Aldehydes, Aliphatic" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2008, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a01_321.pub2}}.</ref><ref>Ashford<U+2019>s Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, page 4180-1</ref> The ''n''-butyraldehyde is made by [[hydroformylation]] of [[propylene]], either in a self-contained plant or as the first step in a fully integrated facility.  Most facilities make ''n''-butanol and [[isobutanol]] in addition to 2-ethylhexanol.

==Nomenclature==
Isooctanol and 2-ethylhexanol are not synonyms.  According to the Chemical Abstracts Service, isooctanol (CAS# 26952-21-6) refers to a different [[isomer]] of [[octanol]], 6-methylheptan-1-ol.
