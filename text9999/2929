'''''Life in Cold Blood''''' is a [[BBC]] [[nature documentary]] series written and presented by [[David Attenborough]], first transmitted in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] from [[4 February]] [[2008]] on [[BBC One]].<ref>[http://www.radiotimes.com/ListingsServlet?event=10&channelId=92&programmeId=73105751&jspLocation=/jsp/prog_details_fullpage.jsp RadioTimes.com: ''Life in Cold Blood'']</ref>

A study of the evolution and habits of [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s, it is the sixth and last of Attenborough's specialised surveys following his major trilogy that began with ''[[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]]''.

The series comprises five 50-minute programmes, each one followed by ''Under the Skin'', a 10-minute section that features Attenborough interviewing the scientists whose work has led to the sequences included in the main programme. It also examines the challenges faced by the crew and reveals some of the techniques used to film the series.<ref name="pressoffice">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/01_january/08/cold.shtml BBC Press Office: ''Life in Cold Blood'']</ref>

The series is a co-production between the [[BBC]] and [[Animal Planet]]. The executive producer is Sara Ford and the series producer is Miles Barton. The ''Under the Skin'' segments were produced by James Brickell in collaboration with the [[Open University]].<ref name="pressoffice" /> The music for the main films was composed by David Poore and Ben Salisbury, whilst the scoring for ''Under the Skin'' was provided by Tony Briscoe.

Within David Attenborough's 'Life' series, it is preceded by ''[[Life in the Undergrowth]]'' (2005).

== Background ==
Filming began in the early part of [[2006]] and, as with Attenborough's previous series, the production team travelled the world to photograph the required sequences. In May 2006, Attenborough celebrated his 80th birthday in the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]] while filming [[giant tortoise]]s, one of which, called [[Lonesome George]], is thought to be the same age.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/david_attenborough.shtml BBC David Attenborough biography]</ref>

Several innovative techniques were used to capture footage. [[Thermography|Thermal imaging]] cameras were used to demonstrate the creatures' variable body temperatures, probe cameras allowed access to underground habitats and even a matchbox-sized one was attached to the shell of a [[tortoise]].<ref name="techniques">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/lifeincoldblood/techniques.shtml BBC Science and Nature: ''Life in Cold Blood'' filming techniques]</ref>

Expert scientists helped the producers to film animal behaviour that is rarely seen. The team 'staked out' radiotagged [[Crotalus horridus|timber rattlesnake]]s in order to witness one of them despatching its prey. However, for Attenborough's close encounter with a spitting [[cobra]], a captive snake that was used to being handled was placed in a natural setting and the presenter wore a face visor. Other examples of 'pets' being used were for sequences depicting the lassoing tongue of a [[chameleon]] (which had to be [[High speed photography|filmed at ultra-high speed]]) and the digestive system of a [[Pythonidae|python]] (which was enhanced by [[computer-generated imagery]]).<ref name="techniques"/>

''Life in Cold Blood'' is Attenborough's last major series and also represents the final study in his 'Life' series, which comprises 79 programmes. In a 2008 interview, he stated:
<blockquote>The evolutionary history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will come along and tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still have something to say about the world we live in.<ref>''Radio Times'' 26 Jan<U+2013>1 Feb 2008: "The Last Word", interview with Jeremy Paxman</ref></blockquote>

However, although Attenborough is 81 years old, he is developing further projects with the BBC Natural History Unit that he is expected to narrate rather than present.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/sep/21/bbc.television1 Guardian: David Attenborough returns for two BBC natural history series]</ref>

Attenborough confirmed on the penultimate edition of ''Parkinson'', broadcast on [[16 December]] 2007, that he did not intend to retire completely and would still make occasional single documentaries, rather than any more series.

== Episodes ==
{{quotation|"Reptiles and amphibians are sometimes thought of as primitive, dull and dimwitted. In fact, of course, they can be lethally fast, spectacularly beautiful, surprisingly affectionate and very sophisticated."| David Attenborough's opening words}}

=== 1. "The Cold Blooded Truth" ===
Broadcast [[4 February]] 2008, the first episode discusses the keys to success of reptiles and amphibians, looking at [[thermoregulation]], parental care and the time-scales on which reptiles operate. Attenborough begins in the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]], using [[thermography|thermal imaging]] to demonstrate how [[marine iguanas]] warm their bodies by basking in the sun before feeding. Meanwhile, the [[lizard]] inhabitants of a [[Minorca]]n island have a relationship with its indigenous [[Helicodiceros muscivorus|dead horse arum]] plants. Attenborough visits [[Dassen Island]] to witness one of the world's greatest concentrations of [[tortoise]]s <U+2014> around 5,000 of them. Few reptiles are active at night, but [[crocodiles]] can rely on water that retains much of its daytime temperature. Conversely, amphibians' moist skin would be damaged by the sun and so most are nocturnal. An exception is the [[Phyllomedusa sauvagii|waxy monkey leaf frog]], which can deal with sunlight by covering its body in a wax secretion. A [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]] illustrates the relative inactivity of reptiles compared to [[mammal]]s: one large meal can last up to a year. When it hatches at the onset of winter, the young [[Painted Turtle|painted turtle]] stays underground, near frozen until the spring when it can emerge. Attenborough wonders if the [[dinosaur]]s' immense size allowed them to maintain warm blood. The largest living reptile is the [[leatherback turtle]] and indeed is able to do so because of insulating body fat. ''Under the Skin'' looks at the hunt for the [[chameleon|pygmy leaf chameleon]], filmed in [[Madagascar]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Cold Blooded Truth| series = Life in Cold Blood | credits = Writer David Attenborough, Director Scott Alexander, Producer Miles Barton | network = BBC | station = BBC One | airdate = 2008-02-04}}</ref>

=== 2. "Land Invaders" ===
Broadcast [[11 February]] 2008, the second programme explores the world of [[amphibian]]s, of which there are some 6,000 known species. Attenborough visits [[Australia]] to illustrate how they became the first back-boned creatures to colonise land: the [[lungfish]], which is capable of breathing air, and whose ancestors became the first amphibians. The largest of them is the [[Japanese giant salamander]] and two are shown wrestling for territory. In [[North America]], the [[Marbled Salamander|marbled salamander]] spends most of its life on land, yet is still able to retain the necessary moisture in its skin through the damp [[plant litter|leaf litter]]. A female [[caecilian]] is filmed with her young, whose rapid growth is discovered to be the result of eating their mother's skin <U+2014> re-grown for them every three days. The most successful amphibians are [[frogs]] and [[toads]]. Their calls are most active during the breeding season: females are impressed by both volume and frequency. However, gestures are sometimes needed and the poisonous [[Panamanian golden frog]] uses a conspicuous form of '[[semaphore]]'. Most other frogs rely on [[camouflage]] and the [[Agalychnis callidryas|South American red-eyed tree frog]] is an example. An [[African Bullfrog|African bullfrog]] is shown defending its exposed tadpoles by digging a canal for them. Meanwhile, the male [[Pouched Frog|marsupial frog]] keeps its young moist by carrying them in its skin pouches. ''Under the Skin'' examines the filming of the last population of Panamanian golden frogs, which is threatened by a fungal disease.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Land Invaders| series = Life in Cold Blood | credits = Writer David Attenborough, Director Scott Alexander, Producer Hilary Jeffkins | network = BBC | station = BBC One | airdate = 2008-02-11}}</ref>

=== 3. "Dragons of the Dry" ===
Broadcast [[18 February]] 2008, the third instalment takes a look at the immense diversity, social skills and displays of the [[lizard]]s. While they are highly adept at camouflage, occasionally there is a need to break cover in order to ward off rivals. Attenborough holds up a mirror to an [[Polychrotidae|anole]] and causes it to extend its colourful throat flap as a warning sign. Madagascar is host to over 60 species of [[chameleon]] but one of the largest, Meller's chameleon, is native to [[Malawi]] and two rival males are shown jousting. A female [[Bradypodion|South African dwarf chameleon]] demonstrates its ability to [[chromatophore|change colour]] when communicating to a potential mate, and the chameleon's muscular tongue is depicted lassoing its prey. In southern Australia, Attenborough uses a baited fishing rod to attract the attention of a rare [[Adelaide Pigmy Blue-tongue Skink|pygmy bluetongue]] [[skink]], thought to have been extinct for over thirty years until it was rediscovered in 1992. [[Stump-tailed skink|Shingleback]]s are among the most devoted lizards and breeding pairs can reunite each year for up to two decades. Alongside South Africa's [[Orange River]], large groups of [[Platysaurus|flat lizard]]s feed on the swarms of [[black fly|black flies]], but the males also use the occasion to indulge in social squabbling. The [[Mexican Beaded Lizard|Mexican beaded lizard]] is one of the few with a poisonous bite, but males do not employ it when wrestling each other. Finally, Attenborough comes face to face with a [[perentie]], Australia's largest [[monitor lizard]]. ''Under the Skin'' focuses on filming in Australia.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Dragons of the Dry| series = Life in Cold Blood | credits = Writer David Attenborough, Director Scott Alexander, Producer Miles Barton | network = BBC | station = BBC One | airdate = 2008-02-18}}</ref>

=== 4. "Sophisticated Serpents" ===
Broadcast [[25 February]] 2008, the fourth episode focuses on the most modern reptiles, the [[snake]]s, exploring how they have managed to become successful despite their elongated body shape. Attenborough explains how they evolved from underground burrowers to surface hunters, losing their limbs in the process. With the aid of infrared cameras, a [[crotalus horridus|timber rattlesnake]] is shown lying in wait for a mouse and sensing its repeated path before despatching and eating it. A snake's constantly flickering tongue is used to gather and evaluate the molecules of its surroundings, and Attenborough visits [[Carnac Island]] to witness a population of blind [[tiger snake]]s, which feed on the chicks of nesting [[gull]]s. He also confronts a [[Mozambique Spitting Cobra|Mozambique spitting cobra]], which quickly sprays [[venom]] over the presenter's protective face visor. The similarities in colouration between the harmless [[kingsnake]] and potentially lethal [[coral snake]] are highlighted. An example of a snake that can tackle unusual prey is the [[Queen snake]], which almost exclusively hunts newly-[[ecdysis|moulted]] [[crayfish]]. A pair of rival male [[King Cobra|King cobra]]s are seen battling and infant [[cobra]]s are shown hatching: their venom is immediately as fatal as that of their parents. In [[Argentina]], a [[yellow anaconda]] evades nearby [[Alligatoridae|caiman]]s to give birth to live young. Finally a turtle-headed [[sea snake]] feeds not on fish, but on their eggs laid on a [[coral reef]]. ''Under the Skin'' discusses the filming of timber rattlesnakes during inclement weather.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Sophisticated Serpents| series = Life in Cold Blood | credits = Writer David Attenborough, Director Scott Alexander, Producer James Brickell | network = BBC | station = BBC One | airdate = 2008-02-25}}</ref>

=== 5. "Armoured Giants" ===
Broadcast [[3 March]] 2008, the final programme covers the most ancient of the reptiles: the [[crocodile]]s and [[turtle]]s. In the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]], among the [[giant tortoise]]s, Attenborough explains how the creatures came to develop their [[animal shell|shell]]s as a defence against predators. This is demonstrated by the [[Terrapene carolina carolina|eastern box turtle]], whose shell includes a hinged 'drawbridge'. The aquatic [[Pig-nosed Turtle|pig-nosed turtle]] is unusual in that its eggs need to be submerged before hatching, whereas those of other species would drown; Attenborough illustrates this by dropping an egg into a jar of water: it immediately hatches. In the open ocean, male [[sea turtle]]s attempt to separate a rival from its mate by attacking and overwhelming the pair, stopping them from taking in air. In northern Australia, Attenborough observes a large gathering of [[crocodile]]s at a flooded coastal road: they time their arrival to ambush migrating [[flathead mullet|mullet]]. The complex communication and body language of the [[American Alligator|American alligator]] is investigated and in Argentina, the calls of young caimans help their mother locate and lead them to a nursery pool. The mother's maternal instinct extends to releasing unhatched babies by gently crushing their eggs in its jaws. In [[Venezuela]], a female [[Spectacled Caiman|spectacled caiman]] in charge of an entire cr<U+00E8>che leads the infants from a drying river bed on a trek to permanent water. ''Under the Skin'' explores filming on the Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands and Attenborough's meeting with [[Lonesome George]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = Armoured Giants | series = Life in Cold Blood | credits = Writer David Attenborough, Director Scott Alexander, Producer Adam White | network = BBC | station = BBC One | airdate = 2008-03-03}}</ref>

{{quotation|"Reptiles and amphibians are sometimes seen as simple, primitive creatures. That's a long way from the truth. The fact that they are solar-powered means that their bodies require only 10% of the energy that mammals of a similar size require. At a time when we ourselves are becoming increasingly concerned about the way in which we get our energy from the environment and the wasteful way in which we use it, maybe there are things that we can learn from 'life in cold blood'."| David Attenborough, in closing}}
