The '''Panopticon''' is a  type of [[prison]] building designed by English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1785. The concept of the design is to allow an observer to observe (''-opticon'') all (''pan-'') prisoners without the prisoners being able to tell whether they are being watched, thereby conveying what one architect has called the "sentiment of an invisible [[omniscience]]."<ref>Lang, Silke Berit. [http://graphics.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Dissertations/Lan04.pdf "The Impact of Video Systems on Architecture"], dissertion, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, 2004.</ref>

Bentham himself described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example."<ref>Bentham, Jeremy. ''[http://cartome.org/panopticon2.htm Panopticon (Preface)]''. In [[Miran Bozovic]] (ed.), ''The Panopticon Writings'', London: Verso, 1995, 29-95.</ref>

==Conceptual history==

:''"Morals reformed<U+2014> health preserved <U+2014> industry invigorated <U+2014> instruction diffused <U+2014> public burthens lightened <U+2014> Economy seated, as it were, upon a rock <U+2014> the [[Gordian Knot|gordian knot]] of the [[Poor Law|poor-law]] not cut, but untied <U+2014> all by a simple idea in Architecture!"''<ref>Jeremy Bentham. ''[http://cartome.org/panopticon2.htm Panopticon]''. In [[Miran Bozovic]] (ed.), ''The Panopticon Writings'', London: Verso, 1995, 29-95.</ref> 

Bentham derived the idea from the plan of a [[military school]] in [[Paris]] designed for easy supervision, itself conceived by his brother [[Samuel Bentham|Samuel]] who arrived at it as a solution to the complexities involved in the handling of large numbers of men. Bentham supplemented this principle with the idea of ''contract management''; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a pecuniary interest in lowering the average rate of mortality. The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; "Allow me to construct a prison on this model," Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, "I will be the [[gaoler]]. You will see ... that the gaoler will have no salary <U+2014> will cost nothing to the nation." As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched.  According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour walking on wheels to spin looms or run a water wheel.  This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.<ref>In [[Miran Bozovic]] (ed.), ''The Panopticon Writings'', London: Verso, 1995, 29-95.</ref>

Bentham devoted a large part of his time and almost his whole fortune to promote the construction of a prison based on his scheme. After many years and innumerable political and financial difficulties, he eventually obtained a favourable sanction from [[Parliament]] for the purchase of a place to erect the prison, but in [[1811]] after the King refused to authorize the purchase of the land, the project was finally aborted. In [[1813]] he was awarded a sum of <U+00A3>23,000 in compensation for his monetary loss which did little to alleviate Bentham's unhappiness for the miscarriage.

While the design did not come to fruition during Bentham's time, it has been seen as an important development. For instance, the design was invoked by [[Michel Foucault]] (in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'') as metaphor for modern "disciplinary" societies and its pervasive inclination to observe and normalise. Foucault proposes that not only prisons but all [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures like the army, the school, the hospital and the factory have evolved through history to resemble Bentham's Panopticon. The notoriety of the design today (although not its lasting influence in architectural realities) stems from Foucault's famous analysis of it.

The architecture {{epigraph
| quote = ''incorporates a tower central to a circular building that is divided into cells, each cell extending the entire thickness of the building to allow inner and outer windows. The occupants of the cells are thus backlit, isolated from one another by walls, and subject to scrutiny both collectively and individually by an observer in the tower who remains unseen. Toward this end, Bentham envisioned not only [[venetian blinds]] on the tower observation ports but also maze-like connections among tower rooms to avoid glints of light or noise that might betray the presence of an observer''

The Panopticon is widely, but erroneously, believed to have influenced the design of [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville Prison]] in North London, [[Armagh Gaol]] in Northern Ireland<!-- dead link    <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/restoration/profiles/?6]</ref> -->, and [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]].  These, however, were [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] examples of the [[Separate system]], which was more about prisoner isolation than prisoner [[surveillance]]; in fact, the separate system makes surveillance quite difficult.  No true panopticons were built in Britain during Bentham's lifetime, and very few anywhere in the British Empire.

Many modern prisons built today are built in a "podular" design {{Fact|date=March 2009}}influenced by the Panopticon design, in intent and basic organization if not in exact form. As compared to traditional "cellblock" designs, in which rectangular buildings contain tiers of cells one atop the other in front of a walkway along which correctional officers patrol, modern prisons are often decentralized and contain triangular or trapezoidal-shaped housing units known as "pods" or "modules" designed to hold between sixteen and fifty prisoners each. In these designs, cells are laid out in three or fewer tiers arrayed around either a central control station or a desk which affords a single correctional officer full view of all cells within either a 270<U+00B0> or 180<U+00B0> field of view (180<U+00B0> is considered a closer level of supervision). Control of cell doors, CCTV monitors, and communications are all conducted from the control station. The correctional officer, depending on the level of security and segregation, may be armed with nonlethal and lethal weapons to cover the pod as well. Increasingly, meals, laundry, commissary items and other goods and services are dispatched directly to the pods or individual cells. These design points, whatever their deliberate or incidental psychological and social effects, serve to maximize the number of prisoners that can be controlled and monitored by one individual, reducing staffing; as well as restricting prisoner movement throughout the prison as tightly as possible.

==Other panoptic structures==

The Panopticon has been suggested as an "open" [[hospital]] architecture: "Hospitals required knowledge of contacts, contagions, proximity and crowding... at the same time to divide space and keep it open, assuring a surveillance which is both global and individualising", 1977 interview (preface to French edition of Jeremy Bentham's "Panopticon").{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The Worcester State Hospital, constructed in the late 19th century, extensively employed panoptic structures to allow more efficient observation of the inmates.  It was considered a model facility at the time.

The only industrial building ever to be built on the Panopticon principle was the Round Mill in Belper, Derbyshire, England. Constructed in 1811 it fell into disuse by the beginning of the twentieth century and was demolished in 1959. <ref>Farmer, Adrian, Belper and Milford, Tempus Publishing, Stroud, Gloucestershire, 2004, 119.</ref>
 
Contemporary social critics often assert that [[technology]] has allowed for the deployment of panoptic structures invisibly throughout society. [[Surveillance]] by [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) cameras in public spaces is an example of a technology that brings the gaze of a superior into the daily lives of the populace. Further more, a number of cities in England (UK), including Middlesbrough, Bristol, Brighton and London have recently added loudspeakers to the a number of their existing CCTV cameras. They can transmit the voice of a camera supervisor in order to issue audible messages to the public.<ref>[http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092206/view4.cfm Cameras Help Stop Crime] The Hoya, [[September 22]] [[2006]]</ref><ref>[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/09/351051.html 2006, But Has 1984 Finally Arrived?] Indymedia UK, [[19 September]] [[2006]]</ref> Similarly, critical analyses of internet practice have suggested that the internet allows for a panopticon form of observation. <ref>[http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol003.001/brignall.html The New Panopticon: <br>The Internet Viewed as a Structure of Social Control<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Internet Service Providers|ISP]]s are able to track users' activities, while user-generated content means that daily social activity may be recorded and broadcast online. <ref> [http://mobimundi.net WORKSHOP:Exploring the Impact of User-generated Mobile Content <U+2013> The Participatory Panopticon] </ref>

===In popular culture===
* In [[Franz Kafka]]'s "[[The Castle]]", the main character, K, finds himself in a village which is overseen by an unreachable Castle, bearing [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s design.
* [[Closed-circuit television]] is similar to the methods used in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by the [[thought police]] to control the citizenry. At any moment, a person may or may not be being observed via a [[telescreen]], though whether one is being watched at any given moment is unknown to that person.
* In [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]]'s novella, ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]'', the Vicario brothers spend three years in the "panopticon of Riohacha" awaiting trial for the murder of Santiago Nasar.
* [[Angela Carter]] also includes a critique of the Panopticon prison system during the Siberian segment of [[Nights at the Circus]].
* [[John Twelve Hawks]] writes about panopticon as a model for society in his book [[The Traveler (novel)|The Traveler]]
* In her 2008 young adult novel ''The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks,'' [[E. Lockhart]] has the protagonist talk about reading an excerpt from [[Michel Foucault]]'s book ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' in which he "uses the idea of the panopticon as a metaphor for Western society and its emphasis on normalization and observation" (Lockhart 2008, p. 54). She goes on to bring up the panopticon again throughout the course of the book.
* In the [[Terry Pratchett]] novel ''[[Making Money]]'', a banker has a similar device so that he can supervise the work of all the clerks at the bank.
*[[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Glasshouse (novel)|Glasshouse]] features a technology-enabled panopticon as the novel's primary location.  "Glasshouse" is [[British Army]] [[slang]] for a [[Glasshouse (British Army)|military prison]].<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasshouse_(British_Army) Glasshouse (British Army)] Wikipedia</ref>.
* The popular film ''[[Gilda]]'' ([[1946]]) features a panopticon-style headquarters in the casino of Nazist crime lord Ballin Mundson ([[George Macready]]). This menacing office and control base allows Mundson to oversee his gambling empire, and also provides Johnny Farrell ([[Glenn Ford]]) with a means to keep a check on the activities of the film's eponymous ''[[femme fatale]]'' ([[Rita Hayworth]]).
* The 1993 science fiction film [[Fortress (1993 film)|Fortress]] features a heavily panoptic multi-level structure, albeit wholly underground. Most of the control over the structure and the inmates is given to the prison's central computer in similar vein to above literature, with ultimate leverage still exercised by the half-cyborg prison director.
* In prison drama series [[Oz (TV series)|''Oz'']] Emerald City unit features a central control station with visibility to all pods.
* The 2004 sci-fi adventure [[The Chronicles of Riddick]] employs a similar underground structure, which is set deep within the recesses of a planetoid enduring extreme ground temperatures day and night. 
* In the British TV science fiction series [[Doctor Who]], the main room of the Capitol on Gallifrey (the Time Lords' home planet) was called the Panopticon, although it apparently did not have a panoptic design. (It may have been called that because events there were televised to the whole planet.)
* In the television show [[LOST]] much of how the [[Others]] watched [[Jack Shepherd]], [[James "Sawyer" Ford]], and [[Kate Austen]] was very similar to the Panopticon. A character even takes the name of [[Jeremy Bentham]] in Season 4.
* Post-metal band [[Isis (band)|Isis]]'s 2004 album ''[[Panopticon (album)|Panopticon]]'' takes both its title and its central lyrical theme from the Panopticon design.
*[[Joanna Newsom]] references the panopticon in the song Yarn and Glue.
* The 1998 video game [[Sanitarium (videogame)|Sanitarium]] features a [[mental asylum]] designed as Panopticon.
* In the 2000 video game [[Deus Ex]] 'panopticon' is the password for a computer terminal that allows access to the fictional omniscient, media controlling AI [[Helios]].
* The Asylum level of the 2003 game [[XIII (video game)|XIII]] contains a cell block that is organized in this manner.
* The 2004 game [[Silent Hill 4]] featured the Water Prison, a panopticon in 'prison world' which the main character visits. The water prison was used to punish and brainwash the children of the Holy Mother sect from the town of [[Silent Hill]].
* "After The Rush Hour" by [[Million Dead]], from their 2nd album [[Harmony No Harmony]], mentions to "Mazzini's Paradisiacal Panopticon" referring to Italian Politician [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]
