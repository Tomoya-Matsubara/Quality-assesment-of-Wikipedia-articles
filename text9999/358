'''Bradley Land''' was the name [[Frederick Cook]] gave to a mass of land which he claimed to have seen between ({{coord|84|20|N|102|0|W|}}) and ({{coord|85|11|N|102|0|W|}}) during a 1909 expedition. He described it as two masses of land with a break, a strait, or an indentation between.<ref>{{cite book |title=The North Pole and Bradley Land |last=Balch |first=Edwin Swift  |year=1913 |publisher=Campion and Company |location=Philadelphia |isbn= |page=54 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mc6fAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The land was named for John R. Bradley, who had sponsored Cook's expedition.

Cook published two photographs of the land and described it thus: "The lower coast resembled Heiberg Island, with mountains and high valleys. The upper coast I estimated as being about one thousand feet high, flat, and covered with a thin sheet ice."<ref>{{cite book |title=My Attainment of the Pole: Being the Record of the Expedition that First Reached the Boreal Center, 1907<U+2013>1909 |last=Cook |first=Frederick A. |year=1911 |publisher=The Polar Publishing Co |location=New York |isbn= |page=246 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=918uAAAAYAAJ }}</ref> 

It is now known there is no land at that location and Cook's observations were based on either a misidentification of sea ice or an outright fabrication.  Cook's Inuit companions reported that the photographs were actually taken near the coast of [[Axel Heiberg Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humbug.polarhist.com/bland.html |title=Fredrick A.
