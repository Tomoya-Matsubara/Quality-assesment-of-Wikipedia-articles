==Flight==

Following its scheduled departure time of 22:35 ([[UTC]]) from [[Dubai International Airport]] in Dubai, the plane crashed upon landing on the {{convert|8033|ft|m}} runway number 06/24 at Mangalore International Airport at around 01:00 [[UTC]]. Situated in a hilly area, the airport is one of seven Indian airports designated as a "critical airfield" by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. DGCA rules at critical airfields prohibit "supervised take offs and landings", so that only the captain (not the first officer) may pilot an aircraft during take-off and landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dgca.nic.in/rules/aero-ind.htm |title=Aeronautical Information Circulars |publisher=Dgca.nic.in |date= |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dgca.nic.in/aic/aic09_07.pdf |title=NEW DELHI-110003 |publisher=Government of India, Aeronautical information Services |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref><ref name="india5962329">{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5962329.cms|title=Mangalore airport tests pilot's skills: Krishna|work=The Economic Times |location=India|accessdate=22 May 2010|date=22 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref><ref name="Difficult runway">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2006/12/16/stories/2006121600490100.htm|title=Hi-fliers on a high|publisher=The Hindu|date=16 December 2006}}</ref> The airport is one of three airports in India having [[Tabletop runway|table top runway]]s (the others being [[Calicut International Airport|Kozhikode]] and [[Lengpui Airport|Lengpui]])<ref>{{cite news|url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/Indian-skies-are-safe-for-flying-Kanu-Gohain-Ex-Director-General-DGCA/articleshow/5964029.cms|title= Indian skies are safe for flying: Kanu Gohain, Ex-Director General, DGCA|date= 23 May 2010|work=The Economic Times |location=India|accessdate= 23 May 2010}}</ref> that require a very precise landing approach.<ref name="Tabletop">{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/05/23/stories/2010052356181100.htm|title=Tabletop runway creates an optical illusion, says pilot|date=23 May 2010 | location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu}}</ref>

==Crash==
[[Image:Bajpe plane crash (40).jpg|thumb|The plane's wreckage at the crash site]]
After touching down, the plane overran runway 06/24 and crashed down the hill at its far end.<ref name="India Plane Crash Kills At Least 160 People"/> The final conversations between [[Air traffic control]] (ATC) and the pilot prior to the landing showed no indication of distress.<ref name="India Plane Crash Kills At Least 160 People"/><ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Updated 1136 hrs 3 Feb 2010(+5:30 GMT)--> |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mangalore-atc-had-no-inkling-of-a-disaster/116125-3.html?from=tn |title=Last conversation between ATC and IX 812 <U+2013> India News <U+2013> IBNLive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> 

The then [[Ministry of Civil Aviation (India)|Civil Aviation Minister]], [[Praful Patel]] said that the aircraft was following an [[Instrument landing system]] (ILS) approach for landing on the newer runway, which was commissioned in 2006. The pilot reported to ATC that it was 'established' on an ILS approach about {{Convert|4.3|mi|km}} from touchdown; landing clearance was then given at {{convert|2000|ft|m}} from touchdown. The aeroplane concluded its ILS approach on runway 24, touching down {{convert|300|ft|m}} past the touch down zone, then overran the runway and ploughed through a {{Convert|90|m|ft}} sand arrestor bed which did not stop it. As the aircraft passed the arrester bed, its starboard wing collided with the concrete socket of the ILS localiser antenna, it then plunged over the cliff and on to the hillside coming to a stop {{Convert|660|to|980|ft|m}} metres past the top of the slope.<ref name="cliff"/>
