==History==
Peter Steiner, a cartoonist and contributor to ''The New Yorker'' since [[1980]], said the cartoon initially did not get a lot of attention, but later took on a life of its own, and that he felt similar to the person who created the "[[smiley face]]."<ref name=fleishman /> In fact, Steiner was not that interested in the [[Internet]] when he drew the cartoon, and although he did have an online account, he recalled attaching no "profound" meaning to the cartoon; it was just something he drew in the manner of a "make-up-a-caption" cartoon.<ref name=fleishman />

==As a commentary on Internet privacy==
{{see also|Internet privacy}}
The cartoon symbolizes an understanding of the Internet that stresses the ability of users to send and receive messages in general obscurity. [[Lawrence Lessig]] suggests "no one knows" because [[Internet protocols]] do not force users to identify themselves, although [[Internet access|local access point]]s such as a user's university may; but this information is privately held by the local access point and not part of the Internet transaction itself.<ref>{{cite book|title=Code: Version 2.0|first=Lawrence|last=Lessig|authorlink=Lawrence Lessig|pages=35|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465039146}}</ref>

==As a commentary on Internet sociology==
A study by Morahan-Martin and Schumacher (2000) on compulsive or problematic Internet use discusses this phenomenon, suggesting the ability to self-represent from behind the computer screen may be part of the compulsion to go online.<ref>Morahan-Martin, J., & Schumacher, P.(2000).Incidence and Correlates of Pathological Internet Use among College Students. Computers in Human Behavior, 16, 13-29.</ref> The phrase can be taken "to mean that [[cyberspace]] will be liberatory because gender, race, age, looks, or even 'dogness' are potentially absent or alternatively fabricated or exaggerated with unchecked creative license for a multitude of purposes both legal and illegal", an understanding echoed in [[1996]] by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], a key figure in the history of [[Usenet]].<ref name=Jordan>{{cite book|title=Cyberpower: The Culture and Politics of Cyberspace and the Internet|first=Tim|last=Jordan|pages=66|chapter=3 The virtual individual|year=1999|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415170788}}</ref> The phrase also suggests the ability to "computer [[crossdress]]" and represent oneself as a different gender, age, race, etc.<ref name=Trend/> On another level, "the freedom which the dog chooses to avail itself of, is the freedom to '[[Passing (sociology)|pass]]' as part of a privileged group; i.e. human [[computer user]]s with access to the Internet."<ref name=Trend>{{cite book|title=Reading Digital Culture|first=David|last=Trend|pages=226-7|year=2001 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0631223029}}</ref><ref name="wired">{{Cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/09/fraudster-who-i.html|title=Fraudster Who Impersonated a Lawyer to Steal Domain Names Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 2|publisher=Wired - Cond<U+00E9>Net|year=2007|author=Ryan Singel|language=English}}</ref> In [[2007]], the cartoon was used to illustrate how the 17 year-old founder of a website could be mistaken for a seasoned Internet professional, and as a metaphor for the program [[Wikiscanner]] that is able to link anonymous editors of [[Wikipedia]] to the organization owning that [[IP address]].<ref name="crikey">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20070903-Wikipedia-and-the-PM.html|title=Wikipedia and the PM -- the trail is still hot|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 2|publisher=Crickey.com.au - Private Media Pty Ltd,|year=2007|author=Crickey.com.au|language=English}}</ref><ref name="kristv">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kristv.com/Global/story.asp?S=7005491|title=From Teenager's Hobby to Booming Online Business|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 2|publisher=CBS KRISTV.com/WorldNow |year=2007|author=Chuck Salter|language=English}}</ref> There may also be relevance to the possibility of using the internet for [[paedophilia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Child Pornography: An Internet Crime|first=Maxwell|last=Taylor |coauthors=Ethel Quayle|pages=97|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=1583912444}}</ref>

==Influences==
The cartoon has inspired the play ''[[Nobody Knows I'm a Dog]]'' by [[Alan David Perkins]]. The play revolves around six different individuals unable to effectively communicate with people in their lives who find the courage to socialize on the Internet, protected by their anonymity.<ref name=fleishman />
