It primarily details the life of a mysterious girl called Kaguya-hime, who was discovered as a baby inside the stalk of a glowing [[bamboo]] plant. She is said to be from Tsuki-no-Miyako (<U+6708><U+306E><U+90FD> "The Capital of the Moon") and has unusual hair that shines like the moon.

==Narrative==
[[Image:Taketori Monogatari 1.jpg|thumb|right|Taketori no Okina takes Kaguya-hime to his home, Drawn by Tosa Hiromichi, c. 1600]]
One day, while walking in the bamboo forest, an old, childless bamboo cutter called {{Nihongo|Taketori no Okina|<U+7AF9><U+53D6><U+7FC1>||"the Old Man who Harvests Bamboo"}} came across a mysterious, shining stalk of bamboo. After cutting it open, he found inside it a baby the size of his thumb. He rejoiced to find such a beautiful girl and took her home. He and his wife raised her as their own child and named her Kaguya-hime (<U+304B><U+3050><U+3084><U+59EB> "radiant-night princess"). Thereafter, Taketori no Okina found that whenever he cut down a stalk of bamboo, inside would be a small nugget of [[gold]]. Soon he became rich. Kaguya-hime grew from a small baby into a woman of ordinary size and extraordinary beauty. At first, Taketori no Okina tried to keep her away from outsiders, but over time the news of her beauty had spread. 

Eventually, five princes came to Taketori no Okina's residence to ask for Kaguya-hime's hand in marriage. The princes eventually persuaded Taketori no Okina to tell a reluctant Kaguya-hime to choose from among them. Kaguya-hime concocted impossible tasks for the princes, agreeing to marry the one who managed to bring her his specified item. That night, Taketori no Okina told the five princes what each must bring. The first was told to bring her the stone begging bowl of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] from [[India]], the second a jewelled branch from the island of [[Mount Penglai|H<U+014D>rai]],<ref name="McCullough">{{cite book

  }}</ref> the third the legendary robe of the fire-rat of [[China]], the fourth a colored jewel from a [[Japanese dragon|dragon]]'s neck, and the final prince the [[cowrie]] which was born from [[swallow]]s. 

Realizing that it was an impossible task, the first prince returned with an expensive bowl, but after noticing that the bowl did not glow with holy light, Kaguya-hime saw through his deception. Likewise, two other princes attempted to deceive her with fakes, but also failed. The fourth gave up after encountering a storm, while the final prince lost his life in his attempt. 

After this, the [[Emperor of Japan]], Mikado, came to see the strangely beautiful Kaguya-hime and, upon falling in love, asked her to marry him. Although he was not subjected to the impossible trials that had thwarted the princes, Kaguya-hime rejected his request for marriage as well, telling him that she was not of his country and thus could not go to the palace with him. She stayed in contact with the Emperor, but continued to rebuff his requests.

That summer, whenever Kaguya-hime saw the full moon, her eyes filled with tears. Though her adoptive parents worried greatly and questioned her, she was unable to tell them what was wrong. Her behaviour became increasingly erratic until she revealed that she was not of this world and must return to her people on the Moon. In some versions of this tale, it is said that she was sent to the Earth as a temporary [[punishment]] for some crime, while others say it was for safety during a celestial war. 

[[Image:Taketori Monogatari 2.jpg|thumb|right|Kaguya-hime goes back to the Moon]]
As the day of her return approached, the Emperor set many guards around her house to protect her from the Moon people, but when an embassy of "Heavenly Beings" arrived at the door of Taketori no Okina's house, the guards were blinded by a strange light. Kaguya-hime announced that, though she loved her many friends on Earth, she must return with the Moon people to her true home. She wrote sad notes of apology to her parents and to the Emperor, then gave her parents her own robe as a memento. She then took a small taste of the [[elixir of life]], attached it to her letter to the Emperor, and gave it to a guard officer. As she handed it to him, the feather robe was placed on her shoulders, and all of her sadness and compassion for the people of the Earth were forgotten. The heavenly entourage took Kaguya-hime back to ''Tsuki-no-Miyako'' ("the Capital of the Moon"), leaving her earthly foster parents in tears. 

The parents became very sad and were soon put to bed sick. The officer returned to the Emperor with the items Kaguya-hime had given him as her last mortal act, and reported what had happened. The Emperor read her letter and was overcome with sadness. He asked his servants, "Which mountain is the closest place to [[Heaven]]?", to which one replied the Great Mountain of [[Suruga Province]]. The Emperor ordered his men to take the letter to the summit of the mountain and burn it, in the hope that his message would reach the distant princess. The men were also commanded to burn the elixir of immortality since the Emperor did not wish to live forever without being able to see her. The legend has it that the word {{nihongo|''immortality''|<U+4E0D><U+6B7B>|fushi|or ''fuji''}} became the name of the mountain, [[Mount Fuji]]. It is also said that the [[kanji]] for the mountain, <U+5BCC><U+58EB><U+5C71> (literally "Mountain Abounding with Warriors"), is derived from the Emperor's army ascending the slopes of the mountain to carry out his order. It is said that the smoke from the burning still rises to this day. (In the past, Mount Fuji was much more volcanically active.)

==Literary connections==

Elements of the tale were drawn from earlier stories. The protagonist Taketori no Okina, given by name, appears in the earlier poetry collection ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'' (c. 759; poem# 3791). In it, he meets a group of women to whom he recites a poem. This indicates that there previously existed an image or tale revolving around a bamboo cutter and celestial or mystical women.<ref>Horiuchi (1997:345-346)</ref><ref>Satake (2003:14-18)</ref>

A similar retelling of the tale appears in the c. 12th century [[Konjaku Monogatarish<U+016B>]] (volume 31, chapter 33), although their relation is under debate.<ref>Yamada (1963:301-303)</ref>

There have been suggestions that ''The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'' is adapted from the Chinese legend [[Chang'e]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and is related to the tale of ''[[Swan Lake]]''{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. This probably is due to Kaguya-hime wearing the ''hagoromo'' (<U+7FBD><U+8863> "feather robe") when she ascends to her homeland. But the hagoromo figures more famously in a group of tales known as the ''hagoromo densetsu'' (in one example recorded in the ''[[<U+014C>mi Province|<U+014C>mi-no-kuni]] [[Fudoki]]'' tells of a man who instructs his dog to steal the hagoromo of eight heavenly maidens while they were bathing, forcing one of them to become his bride). And the latter is remarkably similar to the tale of the Chinese traditional Magpie Festival legend of the [[Fairy Couple]]. also similar to the story of how [[V<U+00F6>lundr]] Smith and his brothers wedded the swan-maidens.

===Banzhu Guniang===

In 1957, ''Jinyu Fenghuang'' (<U+91D1><U+7389><U+51E4><U+51F0>), a Chinese book of Tibetan tales, was published.<ref>
{{cite book |title=<U+91D1><U+7389><U+51E4><U+51F0> |author= <U+7530><U+6D77><U+71D5> (ed.) |publisher=<U+5C11><U+5E74><U+513F><U+7AE5><U+51FA><U+7248><U+793E> |year=1957 |location=Shanghai |language=Chinese }}</ref>
In early 1970s, Japanese literary researchers became aware that "Banzhu Guniang" (<U+73ED><U+7AF9><U+59D1><U+5A18>), one of the tales in the book, had certain similarities with ''The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter''.<ref>

==Adaptations==
[[Kon Ichikawa]] made a film of the story in 1987.  Composer [[Robert Moran]] saw it and composed an opera based on it, ''[[From the Towers of the Moon]]''.

[[Big Bird in Japan]] includes schoolchildren performing the play within the story.

The Hello Kitty television series has a simplified episode version of this story.

[[Lilpri]] has a character representing Kagura-hime.

In the second Inuyasha movie '''The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass''' contains many references to the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. In addition to this, the villain is supposed to be Princess Kaguya.

In the video game [[<U+014C>kami]], both Princess Kaguya and Taketori no Okina appear as important non-player characters (as Kaguya and Mr. Bamboo, respectively). The sub-plot concerning the two is very similar to The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, with a few clear differences.
