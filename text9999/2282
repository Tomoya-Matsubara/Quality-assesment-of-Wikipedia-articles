 |ShortSummary    = Sonico wakes up late and prepares food for her pet cats. She meets people as she rushes towards the college and still ends up late on her class, which her professor praises her intellect but criticizes for her tardiness. After her class, she engages on a photo shoot with a lecherous client. After an array of photos, the client requests Sonico to wear a much more revealing outfit but thanks to the intervention of Mr. Kitamura, Sonico's manager, she does not. After the photo shoot, she helps her grandmother on a bar where a baseball team is their usual patron giving praises on Sonico's growth. After a phone call from her bandmates, she meets up with Suzu, the bassist, and Fuuri, the drummer. They practice a new song that Suzu composed.
