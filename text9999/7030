'''''The Walking Man''''' (''L'homme qui marche'' in French) is a bronze sculpture by the French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]. It was created by Rodin during 1877 and 1878.

The best example of Rodin<U+2019>s <U+2018>sketchy<U+2019> impressionist sculpture also happens to be his most well-known <U+2018>incomplete<U+2019> figure. This work personifies the latter part of Rodin<U+2019>s career: the dynamic pose of a partial figure. Deriving much from Rodin<U+2019>s earlier work [[Saint John the Baptist (Rodin)|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'']], including the powerful stance, Rodin had stripped all academic associations from his figure, and instead focused on what he considered essential: the dynamic pose.

According to the bibliography supplied by the [[National Gallery of Art]], ''The Walking Man'' is a version of St. John without head and arms. This sculpture, which used to be considered a preliminary study for the complete Baptist, was based on the movement of that piece. According to Albert Elsen and [[Henry Moore]]'s suggestions, ''The Walking Man'' was created for the purpose of a Roman or Greek art without the any live reference.{{Clarify|date=February 2013}}

The art historian [[Leo Steinberg]] said of ''The Walking Man''<U+2019>s pose: <blockquote>
The stance is profoundly unclassical, especially in the digging-in conveyed by the pigeon-toed stride and the rotation of the upper torso. Unlike the balanced, self-possessed classical posture with both feet turned out, Rodin uses the kind of step that brings all power to bear on the moment<U+2019>s work
</blockquote>

The statue has served as the inspiration for the works of other artists, such as [[Carl Sandburg]], who described it in his 1916 poem, "The Walking Man of Rodin": <blockquote>
THE WALKING MAN OF RODIN<br />
Legs hold a torso away from the earth.<br />
And a regular high poem of legs is here.<br />
Powers of bone and cord raise a belly and lungs<br />
Out of ooze and over the loam where eyes look and ears hear<br />
And arms have a chance to hammer and shoot and run motors.<br />
You make us<br />
Proud of our legs, old man.<br />
<br />
And you left off the head here,<br />
The skull found always crumbling neighbor of the ankles. </blockquote>
