As with its predecessors, ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' is a departure from traditional fighting games, notably in its simplified move commands and its emphasis on [[Fighting game#Ring-out|ring outs]] over [[Fighting game#Knockout (K.O.)|knockouts]]. This installment also includes a deeper single-player mode than its predecessors. Known as ''The Subspace Emissary'', this mode is a plot-driven, side-scrolling [[beat 'em up]] game featuring ''Brawl''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> playable characters. ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' supports [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] battles with up to four combatants, and is the first game of its franchise to support online battles through [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].<ref name="Wi-Fi Play">{{cite web|url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/wi-fi/wi-fi01.html|title=Wi-Fi Play|author=Sakurai, Masahiro|date=2007-11-16|publisher=Smash Bros.

==Gameplay==
{{see also|Super Smash Bros. (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the ''Super Smash Bros.'' Series}}
Following the style of its predecessors, the game uses a battle system different from that of typical fighting games. Choosing from a variety of characters, one to four players fight on various stages, trying to knock their opponents off the screen. Instead of using health bars like those used in most fighting games, percentage displays are employed. These start at 0%, and increase as the characters take damage, up to 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies farther back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life or a point depending on the mode of play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic01.html|title= The Basic Rules|accessdate=2007-08-11|date=2007-05-22|publisher=Smash Bros. DOJO!!}}</ref> The game can be played using the [[Wii Remote]] on its side, the Wii Remote and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] together, the [[Wii Remote#Classic Controller|Classic Controller]], or the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] controller, for a total of four possible control styles.<ref name="four control"/> Players are also able to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various02.html|title=Names|accessdate=2007-08-11|date=2007-06-28|publisher= Smash Bros.

[[Image:SSBB Gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Mario]], [[Yoshi]], [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Ike|Ike]], and [[Wario]] preparing to fight. The damage meter now displays the name, image, and series symbol of the character.]]
The characters can fight each other with a variety of attacks. Each move is executed with the press of a button in conjunction with a tilt of the [[analog stick|control stick]] or a press of the [[D-pad]], depending on the mode of control. In addition to basic attacks, such as punches and kicks, characters have access to more powerful smash attacks. Each character also has four character-specific special moves, which often have unique effects beyond damaging an opponent. The game introduces the ability to perform character-specific [[Super (fighting games)|super attacks]], referred to as "Final Smash" moves. Final Smashes are significantly more powerful than regular attacks, having a wide variety of effects that range from nearly unavoidable blasts to temporary transformations. These abilities may be performed upon destroying a Smash Ball, an item bearing the ''Smash Bros.'' symbol. When the Smash Ball has been successfully broken by a character, that character can execute a Final Smash. However, should the player wait too long to use it and sustain too much damage, the ability will be lost and the Smash Ball will be knocked out of the character to resume flying about the stage.<ref name="E3 2006"/><ref name="Final Smash">{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic02.html|title=What is a Final Smash?| accessdate=2007-06-21|date=2007-05-29|publisher=Smash Bros. DOJO!!}}</ref>

The characters can make use of a variety of items, ranging from projectiles to melee weapons. Each item has a different effect on the characters around it. While many items return from previous ''Super Smash Bros.'' games, new items are also introduced in ''Brawl''. Some returning items have also received upgrades, changing their appearances and/or capabilities.<ref name="Returning Items">{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/items/item11.html|title=Items from previous installments| accessdate=2007-11-06|date=2007-11-06|publisher=Smash Bros.

===Group===
[[Image:SSBB Main Menu.jpg|thumb|The main menu, with Options highlighted.]]
In addition to the standard multiplayer mode "Brawl", ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' features other multiplayer modes and options in Group mode.

Special Melee from [[Super Smash Bros. Melee|the previous game]] returns as Special Brawl. In this mode, players are able to battle in matches using special rules for a greater level of customization. Whereas previously standard options such as "Giant Melee" or "Invisible Melee" were limited to only one feature per match, players may now select as many options as they like for a single match.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various04.html |title=Special Brawl |accessdate= 2007-09-13 |date=[[2007-09-13]] |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref>

Another returning game type, Tourney mode, formerly Tournament mode, enables players to create an [[Single-elimination tournament|elimination-based tournament]] with a large number of CPU or human opponents.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various06.html |title=Tourney Mode|accessdate= 2007-09-28 |date=[[2007-09-28]] |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref>

Previously only available in Tournament mode, ''Brawl'' features a multiplayer option called Rotation. Rotation allows up to 16 players to compete in sequence by switching out winners or losers after each round.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various17.html |title=Rotation |accessdate= 2007-12-11 |date=[[2007-12-11]] |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref>

===Solo===
Keeping consistent with its predecessors, ''Brawl'' includes various modes of play from the previous game designed for a single player. In Classic mode, the player goes through a number of semi-randomly generated matches. Each match features an arena or opponent from a particular series, such as [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''The Legend of Zelda'']] or [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video game series|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'']]. Several matches also have a unique battle condition, such as a metal opponent or a two-on-two team battle.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html |title=Classic |accessdate= 2007-10-17|last= |first= |authorlink= |date=2007-10-30 |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!!|publisher= Smashbros.com}}</ref>

As in the previous game, ''Brawl'' has Events, which are matches with predetermined battle conditions. These conditions include defeating opponents within a time limit or using a specific move on opponents. New to the mode, each of the sixty-two Events has three difficulties, with a high score recorded for each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various16.html |title=Events |accessdate=2007-11-29|last= |first= |authorlink= |date=2007-11-29 |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref> In addition to the normal set of forty-one Events played with a single player, a smaller set of twenty-one two-player Co-op Events is included.<ref name="Co-op Events">{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various19.html |title=Co-op Events |accessdate=2007-12-17|last= |first= |authorlink= |date=2007-12-17 |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref>

Also returning from ''Melee'', ''Brawl'' features objective-oriented minigames in Stadium Mode. The Home-Run Contest mode is one of these features. In Home-Run Contest, the player must beat the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)#Other characters|Sandbag]] to deal as much damage as possible in ten seconds, then strike it with a [[Baseball bat|Home-Run Bat]] to send it as far as possible. Returning from the two previous games is the Target Smash! minigame, in which the player must break 10 targets as quickly as possible. Departing from previous incarnations of this mode, players can access five different maps with any character, whereas the previous ''Super Smash Bros.'' games featured one unique map per character. In addition, items are also now available.<ref name="targets"/> Updated from ''Melee'', some Stadium Mode minigames feature cooperative or competitive multiplayer.<ref name="Co-op Events" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various08.html |title=STADIUM: Home-Run Contest |accessdate=2007-10-17|last= |first= |authorlink= |date=2007-10-16 |work=Smash Bros.

[[Image:SSBB Emissary Gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Pit (Kid Icarus)|Pit]] and [[Mario]] in "The Subspace Emissary", fighting against two "Primid" enemies.]]
====Adventure Mode: The Subspace Emissary====
''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' features a new Adventure Mode titled "The Subspace Emissary". This mode features unique character storylines along with numerous [[Side-scrolling video game|side scrolling]] levels and multiple [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] to fight, as well as [[Computer graphics|CG]] [[cut scene]]s explaining the storyline. "The Subspace Emissary" features a new group of antagonists called the Subspace Army, who are led by the Ancient Minister. Some of these enemy characters appeared in previous Nintendo video games, such as [[List of Mario series characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]] from the [[Super Mario Bros. (series)|''Mario'' series]] and a squadron of [[R.O.B.]]s based on classic Nintendo hardware. "The Subspace Emissary" also boasts a number of original enemies, such as the Roader, a robotic unicycle; the Bytan, a one-eyed ball-like creature which can replicate itself if left alone; and the Primid, enemies that come in many variations.<ref>{{citeweb| url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/modea/modea06.html | title=The Enemies From Subspace| accessdate=2007-09-19| date=[[2007-09-19]]| work=Smash Bros. DOJO!!| publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref> Though primarily a single-player mode, "The Subspace Emissary" allows for cooperative multiplayer. This mode also features a unique power-up mechanism in the form of collectible Stickers that can be applied to the base of the player's character trophies.<ref name="Sticker Power-ups">{{cite web |url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/modea/modea12.html |title=Sticker Power-ups |accessdate=2008-01-18 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=[[2008-01-18]] |work=Smash Bros.

DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com |quote=}}</ref>

Unlike other game modes, "The Subspace Emissary" has a team system for the characters. The player begins with a limited choice of characters. Others join the team as the game progresses, while some characters may leave the team temporarily.<ref>{{citeweb| url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/modea/modea04.html | title=Petey Piranha| accessdate=2007-10-08| date=[[2007-08-24]]| work=Smash Bros. DOJO!!| publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref> Once one character loses a life, another character on the team can take his or her place until the stock count, of which each stage has a set number, runs out. The character order can be changed to the player's liking.<ref name="team" />

[[Masahiro Sakurai]] claimed that this mode would be more "fleshed out" than the single-player modes in previous ''Smash Bros.'' titles.<ref name="subspace">{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/modea/modea02.html |title=What is the Subspace Emissary? |accessdate=2007-08-11 |date=[[2007-08-03]] |work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref> [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] has explained that Sakurai always wanted to have a very deep single-player game, but he wanted Sakurai to focus more on the multiplayer aspects in the previous titles since there were already many single-player games of this kind. With the development time allotted for ''Brawl'', both were possible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=64601&page=2 |title=Miyamoto and Sakurai on Nintendo Wii |accessdate=2007-08-11 |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=[[2005-05-11]] |publisher= Eurogamer}}</ref> In order to put together a plotline for the mode, Sakurai enlisted the help of [[Kazushige Nojima]], a scenario writer known for his work on the [[Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' series]].<ref name="IwataAsksSubspace">{{cite web | url = http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/ssbb/vol4_page2.jsp | title = Iwata Asks: Super Smash Bros.

=====Plot=====
The story opens with [[Mario]] and [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]] battling in a stadium in the Smash Bros. world. Suddenly, the Ancient Minister and his Subspace Army attack and unleash a Subspace Bomb, which transports part of the world into Subspace. As the Ancient Minister's armies spread across the land, some heroic characters of the Smash Bros. world team up and attempt to repel the enemy, while the other, villainous characters compete to harvest the power of the good characters by converting them into [[trophies]]. As the adventure progresses, [[Samus Aran]] and [[Pikachu]] infiltrate the Subspace Bomb factory; [[Solid Snake]], [[Lucario]], and [[Meta Knight]] also team up and successfully board and retake the [[Meta Knight|Halberd]], which had been captured by the Subspace Army.

It is revealed that the Ancient Minister is subordinate to [[Ganon|Ganondorf]], who in turn obeys [[Master Hand]]. The Ancient Minister's true identity is found to be that of a [[R.O.B.|R.O.B. unit]], and he eventually rebels against his superiors and joins with the good characters. The allied heroes destroy Ganondorf and [[Bowser]]'s gunship and enter Subspace, where it is revealed R.O.B., Ganondorf, and Master Hand were all pawns of an even higher being, Tabuu. Tabuu unleashes a power blast which transforms all of the heroes into trophies, except for [[Luigi]], [[Ness (Earthbound)|Ness]], and Kirby, who were revived by badges attached to them by [[King Dedede]]. They work together to revive the other heroes scattered across Subspace and make their way through the Great Maze, receiving the help of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] when confronting Tabuu, and challenge him to a final showdown and ultimately defeat him, saving the Smash Bros. universe.

===Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection===
''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' allows players to play against distant opponents through the use of [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. Online multiplayer games can be played either with registered friends or with other randomly selected participants. The players' nicknames will be displayed during multiplayer matches. Additionally, players can converse with up to four phrases that are set by the player beforehand. The four phrases correspond to the characters' [[Taunt#Video games|taunts]] and will appear in [[speech bubbles]] above the characters. These names and phrases are not displayed in random-player matches. A Spectator mode allows players to watch matches from players who have enabled the "Allow Spectators" option, and bet on the outcome using coins earned within the game. The winner of the bet receives a jackpot of coins.<ref name="Spectator">{{cite web|url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/wi-fi/wi-fi02.html |title=Spectator|accessdate=2007-11-16 |author=Sakurai, Masahiro|date=2007-11-16|work=Smash Bros.

In addition, snapshots may be taken during battles or in certain other modes.

===Vault===
Returning from ''Melee'' are [[trophy|trophies]], statuettes of video game characters and objects that can be collected in the game. These trophies give brief histories or descriptions of their subjects.<ref name="Trophies">{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various05.html |title=Trophies |accessdate=2007-10-24|date=2007-09-24|work=Smash Bros.

DOJO!!|publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref> Coins can also be used to bet on the victor of online battles via Spectator Mode.<ref name="Spectator"/>

Some trophies which are unavailable in Coin Launcher mode are obtained by using an item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary single-player mode. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the game.<ref name="Trophy Stands">{{cite web|url= http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/modea/modea11.html |title=Trophy Stands|accessdate=2007-12-30|date=2007-12-26|work=Smash Bros.

In addition to trophies, players can now collect [[Label#Stickers|stickers]] of video game artwork.<ref name="Stickers">{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various03.html |title=Stickers |accessdate=2007-10-24 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=[[2007-08-15]] |work=Smash Bros.

New to ''Brawl'' is the Challenges menu, an [[interactive]] display which catalogs unlocked features and items in gridded windows. Once a window has been broken and its contents are unlocked, horizontally adjacent windows display the conditions necessary to unlock their contents.<ref name="Challenges">{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various22.html |title=Challenges |accessdate=2008-01-19|date=2008-01-14|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref> This system is similar to the [[Kirby Air Ride#Influence in Other Games|Checklist]] feature of the [[Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''.

''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' contains demo versions of classic Nintendo titles, known as Masterpieces within the game, allowing players to relive defining moments of the characters' pasts. These titles utilize [[Virtual Console]] technology to emulate classic hardware. The demos have time constraints ranging from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, and some utilize save data to allow the player to play a certain scenario or level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various23.html |title=Masterpieces |accessdate=2008-01-25|author=Masahiro Sakurai|date=2008-01-25|work=Smash Bros.

<!--DO NOT ADD OR CHANGE ANY EXAMPLES IN THIS SECTION UNLESS IT IS DISCUSSED ON THE TALK PAGE-->
Super Smash Bros. Brawl features 35 playable characters, with some having alternate forms that play differently from each other. The cast of characters includes various returning characters from ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' and a variety of newcomers. Some returning characters have been updated or refined since their last appearance, either in terms of appearance, fighting capabilities, or both. For example, [[Link (character)|Link]] and [[Fox McCloud|Fox]] have taken on new designs from more recent titles, while [[Samus Aran|Samus]] has gained the ability to change into a new form, "[[Samus Aran#Super Smash Bros. series|Zero Suit Samus]]".

Some previously represented series have had more characters added to ''Brawl''.

==Stages==
[[Image:Brawl Stages.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The starting stage select screen in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' with Battlefield being shown.]]
Stages are arenas that are generally based on levels from the various represented game series of ''Super Smash Bros.'' Stages range from floating platforms to moving areas where the characters must stay within the field of play. Each stage has a boundary that cannot be passed, or the character will be "KO'd", thus losing a life or losing a "point".

''Brawl'' contains forty-one selectable stages, with twenty-nine initially available. Many stages undergo elaborate changes while battles take place, such as a cycling day-to-night system<ref name="Battlefield">{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/stages/stage01.html |title=Battlefield |accessdate=2007-06-21 |date=[[2007-05-22]] |work=Smash Bros.

DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref> Environmental gameplay mechanics are featured in this installment, such as [[destructible environment|destructible terrain]] and floating in water. Unlike its predecessors, ''Brawl'' also includes stages based on third-party games such as the ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear Solid]]''-inspired Shadow Moses Island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/stages/stage13.html |title=Shadow Moses Island |accessdate=2007-12-22 |date=[[2007-10-02]] |work=Smash Bros.

DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com}}</ref>

''Brawl'' also allows players to create their own stages using a variety of options in a mode called Stage Builder. Players can save their stages to an [[Secure Digital card|SD card]] or the internal memory of the Wii console. Stages can also be sent to registered friends. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, players are able to submit their creations daily to Nintendo and receive a daily stage from the service.<ref name="Stage Builder">{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various10.html|title=Stage Builder|accessdate=2007-10-29|date=2007-10-29|work=Smash Bros.

==Development==
At the pre-E3 2005 press conference, the president of Nintendo, [[Satoru Iwata]], announced the next installment of ''Super Smash Bros.'' was not only already in development for their next gaming console, but would hopefully be a launch title with Wi-Fi compatibility for online play.<ref name="E3 2005">{{cite web|last=Casamassina |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Casamassina | date=[[2005-05-17]] |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/670/670552p1.html |title=E3 2005: ''Smash Bros.'' For Revolution| publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2006-05-03}}</ref> The announcement was a surprise to [[Masahiro Sakurai]], creator of the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series. In 2003, Sakurai left [[HAL Laboratory]], the company that was in charge of the franchise's development. He was not informed of Nintendo's intent to release another ''Smash'' title, despite the fact that Iwata told Sakurai shortly after his resignation from HAL that if a new ''Smash'' game was to be developed, he would want Sakurai to again serve as director. It was not until after the conference that Sakurai was called to Iwata's hotel room, where he was asked to be involved in the production of the new title, if possible as its director.<ref name="director">{{cite web |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/667/667525p1.html |title=''Smash Bros. Revolution'' Director Revealed|author=IGN Staff |accessdate=2007-06-21 |date=[[2005-11-16]] |publisher=IGN}}</ref> Sakurai agreed to become director, and as of May 2005 was the only member of the new development team. Development of the game did not begin until October 2005,<ref name="oldDojo">{{cite web | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061116232400/www.smashbros.com/en/main.html | archivedate=2006-11-16 | url=http://www.smashbros.com/en/main.html | title = Foreword | accessdate = 2007-11-11 | last = Sakurai | first = Masahiro | authorlink = Masahiro Sakurai| publisher =Smashbros.com}}</ref> when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Nintendo also enlisted outside help from various developer studios, including [[Game Arts]] and [[Monolith Soft]]. Sakurai also stated that these people had spent excessive amounts of time playing ''Super Smash Bros. Melee''. This team was given access to all the original material and tools from the development of ''Melee'', courtesy of HAL Laboratory. Also, several ''Smash Bros.'' staff members that reside around the area of the new office joined the project's development.<ref name="devteam">{{cite web|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/673/673532p1.html|title= Sakurai Elaborates on ''Smash Bros.

The game was absent from Nintendo's Wii showing at its 2006 Pre-E3 press conference. The next day, on Wednesday, [[May 10]], [[2006]], its first official trailer was unveiled at [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3]] and at the After-Hours Press Conference, Nintendo officially revealed the game under the name of ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl''. In an interview with IGN, Sakurai said the Wii's motion sensing features might not be included because, "we found that trying to implement too much motion-sensory functionality can get in the way of the game".<ref name="E3 2006">{{cite web|last=Casamassina |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Casamassina |coauthors=Peer Schneider | date=[[2006-05-10]] |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/707/707504p1.html |title=E3 2006: ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2006-08-01}}</ref> As far as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|Wi-Fi]] play is concerned, Sakurai stated his plan was to include Wi-Fi connection compatibility and online functionality from the start. He goes on to say "one of the primary reasons Super Smash Bros. Brawl was created was that Nintendo, when taking Wii online, wanted to have Smash Bros. to do that".<ref name="E3 2006"/> However, as stated in the Toukouken on the Japanese version of the ''Smash Bros.'' website, "there would be many hurdles to cross", and an online ranking system is unlikely to be implemented.<ref name="Joystiq">{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/05/sakurai-reveals-new-smash-bros-brawl-details/ |title=Sakurai reveals new ''Smash Bros.

At the Nintendo Media Conference at [[History of E3#2007|E3 2007]], it was announced by Nintendo of America president [[Reggie Fils-Aime]] that ''Super Smash Bros.

Due to the fact that ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' is the first Wii title to use a double-layer disc, Nintendo has admitted that some Wii systems have trouble reading the game due to a dirty laser lens. Nintendo is repairing systems with dual-layer problems free of charge, regardless of warranty status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/repair/repair_form_us_ssbb.jsp|title=www.nintendo.com/consumer/repair/repair_form_us_ssbb.jsp<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref><!-- Do NOT add any extra sentences here about the new March release date.

===Inclusion of characters===

Sakurai originally stated that he may not want to put much emphasis on Japan-only characters. However, reflecting upon Marth and Roy's inclusion in ''Melee'' leading to the international release of the formerly exclusive ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series,<ref name="Fire Emblem Details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem Database'|url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/agb-ae7.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-07|date|work=[http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/index.html Nintendo Database]}}</ref> Sakurai expressed more interest in including characters exclusive to Japan-only releases.<ref name="thirdparty">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3151198 |title=Super Smash Bros.

This in turn led to his appearance in the following game instead.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://kotaku.com/gaming/nintendo/e306-super-smash-bros-brawl-qa-173071.php|title = E306: Super Smash Bros.

''[[IGN]]'' critic [[Matt Casamassina]] noted that although ''Brawl'' is "completely engrossing and wholly entertaining," it suffers from "long loading times" and "uninspired enemies" in the ''Subspace Emissary'' adventure mode. The review also gave a mixed response to the quality of the graphics, and described them as "an enhanced version of ''[[Super Smash Bros.
