The Mossad is responsible for [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence collection]] and [[covert operation]]s including [[assassination]]s and [[paramilitary]] activities beyond Israel's borders, and bringing [[Jews]] to Israel from countries where official [[Aliyah]] agencies are forbidden. It is one of the main entities in the [[Israeli Intelligence Community]], along with [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Aman]] ([[military intelligence]]) and [[Shin Bet]] (internal security), but its director reports directly to the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]].

==Organization==
===Executive offices===
The largest department of the Mossad is Collections, tasked with many aspects of conducting espionage overseas. Employees in the Collections Department operate under a variety of covers, including diplomatic and unofficial.<ref name="Globalsecurity">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/israel/mossad.htm Mossad profile], Globalsecurity.org, Retrieved October 28, 2006.</ref>  Their field intelligence officers, called [[katsa]]s (Hebrew: acronym, meaning "Collections Officer"), are similar to [[agent handling|case officers]] of the CIA.  Thirty to forty operate at a time, mainly in Europe and the Middle East.<ref name="By_Way_of_Deception">Ostrovsky, Victor. ''By Way of Deception-The making and unmaking of a Mossad Officer''.  New York: St. Martin's Press, 1990. ISBN 0-9717595-0-2</ref>The Political Action and Liaison Department is responsible for working both with allied foreign intelligence services, and with nations that have no normal diplomatic relations with Israel.<ref name="Globalsecurity"/>Additionally, the Mossad has a Research Department, tasked with intelligence production, and a Technology Department concerned with the development of tools for Mossad activities.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/israel/mossad/index.html the Mossad profile], Federation of American Scientists. Retrieved October 28, 2006</ref>

==History==
The Mossad was formed on December 13, 1949 as the "Central Institute for Coordination" at the recommendation of [[Reuven Shiloah]] to Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]]. Shiloah wanted a central body to coordinate and improve cooperation between the existing security services <U+2013> the army's intelligence department (AMAN), the General Security Service (GSS or "Shin Bet") and the foreign office's "political department".  In March 1951, it was reorganized and made a part of the prime minister's office, reporting directly to the prime minister.

Mossad's former motto: be-tachb<U+016B>l<U+014D>t ta`aseh lekh<U+0101> milch<U+0101>m<U+0101>h (Hebrew: <U+05D1><U+05EA><U+05D7><U+05D1><U+05D5><U+05DC><U+05D5><U+05EA> <U+05EA><U+05E2><U+05E9><U+05D4> <U+05DC><U+05DA> <U+05DE><U+05DC><U+05D7><U+05DE><U+05D4>) is a quote from the Bible (Proverbs 24:6): "For by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory" (NRSV). The motto was changed recently to another Proverbs passage: be-'<U+00E9>yn tachb<U+016B>l<U+014D>t yippol `<U+0101>m; <U+016B>-tesh<U+016B>`<U+0101>h be-rov y<U+014D>'<U+00E9>ts (Hebrew: <U+05D1><U+05D0><U+05D9><U+05DF> <U+05EA><U+05D7><U+05D1><U+05D5><U+05DC><U+05D5><U+05EA> <U+05D9><U+05E4><U+05D5><U+05DC> <U+05E2><U+05DD>, <U+05D5><U+05EA><U+05E9><U+05D5><U+05E2><U+05D4> <U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05D1> <U+05D9><U+05D5><U+05E2><U+05E5>) (Proverbs 11:14). This is translated by NRSV as: "Where there is no guidance, a nation falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety."

According to journalist [[Ron Ben-Yishai]], potential successors include [[Yuval Diskin]], [[Yoav Galant]], [[Gadi Eisenkot]], [[Benny Gantz]], R ("Dagan's stand-in"), and T (a retired deputy to Dagan).<ref>{{Cite web|first=Ron |last=Ben-Yishai |title=Who will replace Dagan? |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3911495,00.html |publisher=''[[Ynetnews]]'' |date=2010-06-27 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref>

==Relations with other agencies==
Over the last 60 years, the Mossad has experienced a mixed relationship with Western intelligence agencies. A secret addendum was promised to [[Anwar Sadat]] by the CIA if he agreed to the terms of the [[Camp David Accords]]. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] would supply Sadat with all of Israel's military secrets, as part of a covert intelligence liaison between Washington and Cairo. According to a former US army officer:<blockquote>We gave Sadat everything. Satellite photos, intercepts, the location of Israel's nuclear force, everything he wanted. As it turned out, the Israelis discovered that we had bribed Sadat, but [[Menachem Begin|Begin]] told everyone to keep their mouths shut. America was the only ally Israel had left. Still, betraying all of Israel's secrets was a pretty shitty thing for us to do.<ref>{{Cite book

Starting in 1979, the CIA started sharing intelligence provided by the Mossad with [[Saudi Arabia]]. The CIA was "pouring intelligence about Israel into the Saudi's military headquarters." The Saudis lacked the skills to interpret and analyze most of the Israeli intelligence, so the CIA would provide the expertise, and in exchange the Saudis would share US supplied-information about Israel's weak points with other Arab nations.<ref>{{Cite book

In the aftermath of the [[Six Day War]], the [[French government]] and [[Military of France|military]] terminated all weapons support for Israel in a "fawning attempt to please Arab oil kingdoms." Despite the ban, the Mossad was able to convince French intelligence to force their contractors to finish construction on [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear weapons]] project. Prior to the ban, the Mossad uncovered [[Charles De Gaulle]]'s scandalous role in recruiting Fascist fugitives as French agents to fight the Communists in the Balkans. The Mossad revealed that several prominent members of de Gaulle's administration had been [[Nazi]] collaborators, among them [[Andr<U+00E9> Fran<U+00E7>ois-Poncet]].<ref>{{Cite book

During the Eisenhower administration, CIA director [[Allen Welsh Dulles]] was responsible for recruiting [[Nazi]] war criminals as intelligence agents and sponsored their immigration to the United States. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] and Allen Welsh Dulles actively betrayed British, French and Israeli military secrets to the Arab nations in order to gain the dominant role in the Middle East. In response to Eisenhower's policies, the Mossad temporarily abandoned intelligence sharing with the United States and switched allegiances to [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and French intelligence.<ref>{{Cite book

==Alleged operations==

====United States====
During the 1990s, the Mossad discovered a [[Hezbollah]] agent operating within the United States in order to procure materials needed to manufacture [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s and other weapons. In a joint operation with U.S. intelligence, the agent was kept under surveillance in hopes that he would betray more Hezbollah operatives, but was eventually arrested.<ref>Ross, Michael ''The Volunteer'', pp. 168-171</ref>

Shortly before the [[September 11 attacks]], the Mossad warned the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] that it had detected as many as 200 terrorists slipping into the United States and planning a major attack against a large-scale target.<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/mossadwarn.html</ref>

====Argentina====
In 1960, the Mossad discovered that [[Nazi]] [[War crime|war criminal]] [[Adolf Eichmann]] was in [[Argentina]]. A team of five Mossad agents slipped into Argentina and through [[surveillance]], they confirmed that he had been living there under the name of Ricardo Klement. He was abducted on May 11, 1960 and taken to a hideout, where the agents put an SS cap on him and compared him to a photograph of Eichmann in SS uniform, confirming that it was Eichmann. He was subsequently smuggled to Israel aboard an [[El Al]] flight where he was tried and executed. Argentina protested what it considered as the violation of its sovereignty, and the [[United Nations]] [[Security Council]] noted that "repetition of acts such as [this] would involve a breach of the principles upon which international order is founded, creating an atmosphere of insecurity and distrust incompatible with the preservation of peace" while also acknowledging that "Eichmann should be brought to appropriate justice for the crimes of which he is accused" and that "this resolution should in no way be interpreted as condoning the odious crimes of which Eichmann is accused."<ref>Argentina claimed that the "illicit and clandestine transfer of Eichmann from Argentine territory constitutes a flagrant violation of the Argentine State's right of sovereignty[.]" Bass, Gary J. (2004.) The Adolf Eichmann Case: Universal and National Jurisdiction. In Stephen Macedo (ed,) ''Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes''. (ch.4) Philadelphia: U.Penn. Press. In Eichmann's case, the most salient feature from the perspective of international law was the fact of Israeli law enforcement action in another state's territory without consent; the human element includes the dramatic circumstances of the capture by Mossad agents and the ensuing custody and transfer to Israel[.] Damrosch, Lori F. (2004.) Connecting the Threads in the Fabric of International Law. In Stephen Macedo (ed,) ''Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes''.

In 1986, Mossad used an undercover agent to lure nuclear whistleblower [[Mordechai Vanunu]] from the United Kingdom to Italy where he was abducted and transported to Israel where he was tried for treason because of his role in exposing [[Israel's nuclear program]].<ref>http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=%20417663&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y</ref>

Mossad assisted the UK Intelligence organization [[MI5]] following the [[7/7]] bombings in London.  According to the 2007 edition of a book about the Mossad entitled <U+201C>Gideon<U+2019>s Spies,<U+201D> shortly after the 7/7 London underground bombings, the British domestic intelligence agency MI5 gathered evidence that a senior al-Qaeda operative known only by the alias Mustafa travelled in and out of England shortly before the 7/7 bombings. For months, the real identity of Mustafa remained unknown, but in early October 2005, Mossad told MI5 that this person was, in fact, Azhari Husin, a bomb-making expert with Jemaah Islamiyah, the main al-Qaeda affiliate in Southeast Asia. Husin studied in Britain and reports claim that he met the main 7/7 bomber, Mohammad Sidique Khan, in late 2001 in a militant training camp in the Philippines (see Late 2001). Meir Dagan, the head of Mossad, apparently also told MI5 that Husin helped plan and recruit volunteers for the bombings. Mossad claimed that Husin may have been in London at the time of the bombings, and then fled to al-Qaeda<U+2019>s main safe haven in the tribal area of Pakistan, where he sometimes hid after bombings. Husin was killed in a shootout in Indonesia in November 2005.<ref>Thomas, 2007, pp.&nbsp;520, 522</ref> Later official British government reports about the 7/7 bombings did not mention Husin.

====Switzerland====
In February 1998, five Mossad agents were caught wiretapping the home of a [[Hezbollah]] agent in a [[Bern]] suburb. Four agents were freed, but the fifth was tried, found guilty, sentenced to one year in prison, and following his release was banned from entering Switzerland for five years.<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/mossad2.html</ref>

====Soviet Union/Russia====
In February 1956, a friendly member of the [[Politburo]] provided the Mossad with a copy of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s speech denouncing [[Joseph Stalin]]. The Mossad passed it on to the United States, which published the speech, embarrassing the [[USSR]]. This was a major intelligence coup that raised the prestige of the organization.<ref>[http://zionism-israel.com/Israel_espionage_timeline_1948.htm Timeline:Israeli intelligence and covert operations From the War of Independence to 1956]</ref>

In the summer of 2009 the Mossad was reported to have been involved in the hijacking of the ''[[MV Arctic Sea]]'', allegedly carrying Russian missiles to [[Iran]] in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Mark |last=Franchetti |coauthors=Mahnaimi, Uzi |title=Channel pirate ship carried arms for Iran |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6823300.ece |publisher=The Times |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>

====Pakistan====
In a September 2003 news article, it was ''alleged'' by [[rediff.com|Rediff News]] (One of India's leading online portals) that [[Pervez Musharaf|General Pervez Musharaf]], the then-[[President of Pakistan]], decided to establish a clandestine relationship between [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] and Mossad via officers of the two services posted at their embassies in [[Washington, DC]]. The article further ''claimed'' that the ISI had offered Mossad information about Libyan, Syrian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian military which it had acquired through officers on official military deputations on those countries. However, no proof was offered to back up these allegations.<ref>Anonymous: [http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/sep/08spec.htm RAW and Mossad: The secret link] at Rediff.com, 8 Sep 2003</ref>

====India====
After discovering that an Indian nuclear scientist was trying to sell the [[Prithvi missile]] to [[Libya]], the Mossad leaked the information to the Indian government, press, and the [[CIA]], resulting in an investigation, as well as editorials in the Indian press about the need to monitor India's military exports.{{fact}}

====Iran====
Prior to the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1978<U+2013>79 in Iran, [[SAVAK]] (Organization of National Security and Information), the Iranian [[secret police]] and intelligence service was created under the guidance of United States and Israeli intelligence officers in 1957 to protect the regime of the [[Mohammad Reza Shah|shah]] by arresting, torturing, and executing the dissidents (especially Leftists). After security relations between the [[United States]] and Iran grew more distant in the early 1960s which led the [[CIA]] training team to leave [[Iran]], Mossad became increasingly active in Iran, "training SAVAK personnel and carrying out a broad variety of joint operations with SAVAK."<ref>[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v5f3/v5f3a002.html CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) IN PERSIA.] In ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''.

Jordanian authorities apprehended two Mossad agents posing as Canadian tourists and detained a further six. In exchange for their release, an Israeli physician had to fly to Amman and administer an antidote to Mashal.The fall out from the failed assassination eventually led to the release of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of the Hamas movement, and scores of Hamas prisoners.

The Mossad is suspected of establishing a large spy network in Lebanon, recruited from [[Druze]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] communities, and officials in the Lebanese government, to spy on [[Hezbollah]] and its Iranian [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Revolutionary Guard]] advisors. Some have allegedly been active since 1982. In 2009, Lebanese Security Services supported by Hezbollah's intelligence unit, and working in collaboration with [[Syria]], [[Iran]], and possibly [[Russia]], launched a major crackdown which resulted in the arrests of around 100 alleged Israeli spies.<ref>http://www.yalibnan.com/2010/06/28/lebanon-arrests-another-2-over-spying-for-israel/</ref>

====Syria====
[[Eli Cohen]], a spy for the Mossad, infiltrated the highest echelons of the Syrian government, was a close friend of the Syrian President, and was considered for the post of Minister of Defense. He gave his Mossad handlers a complete plan of the Syrian defenses on the [[Golan Heights]], the Syrian Armed Forces order of battle, and a complete list of the Syrian military's weapons inventory. He also ordered the planting of trees by every Syrian fortified position under the pretext of shading soldiers, but the trees actually served as targeting markers for the Israel Defense Forces. He was discovered by Syrian and Soviet intelligence, tried in secret, and executed in 1965.<ref>Our Man in Damascus, 1969.</ref> His information played a crucial role during the [[Six Day War]].

====United Arab Emirates====
{{Main|Assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh}}
The Mossad is suspected of assassinating [[Mahmoud al-Mabhouh]], a senior Hamas military commander, in January 2010 at [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]].  The team which carried out the killing is estimated, on the basis of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] and other evidence, to have consisted of at least 26 agents traveling on bogus passports. The operatives entered al-Mabhouh's hotel room, where Mabhouh was subjected to electric shocks and interrogated.

After the Mossad discovered the presence of two [[Iran]]ian agents in [[Johannesburg]] on a mission to procure advanced weapons systems from [[Denel]], a Mossad agent was deployed, and met up with a local Jewish contact. Posing as South African intelligence, they abducted the Iranians, drove them to a warehouse, and beat and intimidated them before forcing them to leave the country.<ref>Ross, Michael, ''The Volunteer'', pp. 251-272</ref>

====Sudan====
After the [[1994 AMIA bombing]], the Mossad began gathering intelligence for a raid by Israeli Special Forces on the [[Iran]]ian embassy in [[Khartoum]] as retaliation. The operation was called off due to fears that another attack against worldwide Jewish communities might take place as revenge. The Mossad also assisted in [[Operation Moses]], the evacuation of [[Ethiopian Jews]] to Israel from a famine-ridden region of Sudan in 1984, also maintaining a relationship with the Ethiopian government.

====Zimbabwe====
The Mossad secretly evacuated Zimbabewan Jews out of the country due to fears of persecution by the Zimbabwean government, which was allied with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and [[Libya]]. The Mossad infiltrated the Zimbabwean government's [[Central Intelligence Organization]], in response to the supply of [[plutonium]] from the [[Congo]] via Zimbabwe to [[North Korea]], [[Syria]], and [[Iran]]. {{fact}}
