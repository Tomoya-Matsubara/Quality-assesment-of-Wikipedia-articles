"'''Treehouse of Horror V'''" is the sixth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]] and the fifth episode in the ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' series. It premiered on October 30, 1994, and features three short stories called ''The Shinning'', ''Time and Punishment'',  and ''Nightmare Cafeteria''. The episode was directed by [[Jim Reardon]] and written by [[Greg Daniels]], [[Dan McGrath]], [[David X. Cohen|David Cohen]] and [[Bob Kushell]].<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|pages=154, 155}}</ref>

In ''The Shinning'' the Simpsons become caretakers at [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns']] mansion. Deprived of television and beer, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] becomes insane and tries to murder the family; after finding a portable TV set, he returns to normal. In ''Time and Punishment'', Homer repeatedly travels back in time and alters the future; upon failing to restore the future, he settles for a reality close to his own. In ''Nightmare Cafeteria'', [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] begins using students in detention as cafeteria food; when [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] are about to be slaughtered, Bart realizes it is a dream (but is then attacked by fog which turns people inside out).

[[David Mirkin]] deliberately placed more [[graphic violence]] in the episode due to complaints about excessive violence in the show. The episode features [[James Earl Jones]] as the voice of an alternate universe [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] (his second appearance in a Simpsons Halloween episode), and a recurring joke where [[Groundskeeper Willie]] is struck in the back with an axe in every tale when trying to help someone.

==Plot==
===Opening===
[[Marge Simpson|Marge]] warns that the episode is frightening and children should not watch it. During the warning, she receives a note saying that the episode is so scary that [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] would not even let them show it. They suggest that the 1947 [[Glenn Ford]] movie, ''200 Miles to Oregon'', be shown instead. But Bart stops Marge from doing this on a radio transmission, where Homer comes in and ruins the whole experience. Bart shows the episode anyway.

===The Shinning===
[[Simpson family|The Simpsons]] go to Mr. Burns' mansion in the mountains to become its caretakers. Before he leaves, Mr. Burns cuts the cable television wire and removes the beer, believing that this will ensure hard work from the family. While there, [[Groundskeeper Willie]] discovers that Bart has the power to read his thoughts ("[[The Shining (film)|the Shinning]]") and that if Homer goes insane, he should use this to call him. The absence of his two favorite things sends Homer insane and a ghostly [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] tells Homer he must kill his family in order for him to give Homer a beer. Marge later finds a typewriter, and sees the words "Feelin' fine" typed upon them, but a [[lightning]] flash reveals that he has scrawled, "[[All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy|No TV and no beer make Homer go crazy]]" on all the walls. Homer then begins chasing the family with an axe and Bart uses his powers to call Willie, who runs to the family's rescue, dropping his [[pocket television]] in the snow, but Homer kills him by stabbing him in the back with the axe. Homer chases his family outside into the snow and just as he is about to kill them, Lisa finds the [[portable television]] that Willie dropped and shows it to him. With access to television again, Homer's [[insanity]] gradually fades. The family sits in the snow to watch with him and eventually freeze.  The [[Tony Award]]s begin and the family try to change the channel but cannot because they are frozen stiff. As the family watch the Awards helplessly, Homer's insanity rises.

===Time and Punishment===
While trying to fix a broken [[toaster]], Homer accidentally turns it into a [[time travel|time machine]]. It transports him to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times where he realizes that he must be careful because if he affects anything in the past, it could cause changes in the future. He kills a [[mosquito]] before returning to the present and finds a horrific [[dystopia]] where [[Ned Flanders]] is now a brutal world dictator. Homer travels back in time again to try to set things right. However, he accidentally kills a [[Walking fish#Evolutionary link|walking fish]], and after returning to the present he finds Bart and Lisa are [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], narrowly avoiding being crushed by them. He then infects the dinosaurs with a [[common cold|cold virus]] while defending himself from a [[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], which proceeds to cause [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Tertiary extinction event|their extinction]]. He is initially pleased with the results in the present; Bart and Lisa are polite and well-behaved, the family is extremely wealthy and [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]] are dead. However, he is horrified to find that [[doughnut|donuts]] do not exist in this universe. As Homer flees back to the past in terror, however, it is shown that they frequently rain from the sky. In another world, Willie tries to help Homer, but is once again hit in the back with an axe, this time by a talking [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. When Homer returns to the prehistoric times again, he furiously smashes everything in sight with a baseball bat. After several more trips back and forth in time, Homer eventually arrives in a reality that appears normal. However, he finds that humans eat with [[chameleon]]-like tongues, but decides it is close enough.

===Nightmare Cafeteria===
[[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] is worried that the [[School punishment|detention hall]] is becoming overcrowded and [[Springfield Elementary School#Lunchlady Doris|Lunchlady Doris]] is being forced to serve Grade F meat in the cafeteria. Skinner discovers a common solution to both problems: eating misbehaving children. The first student to be eaten is [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Jimbo Jones|Jimbo Jones]] who is served as "[[Sloppy Joes|Sloppy Jimbos]]". [[List of recurring characters on The Simpsons#<U+00DC>ter|<U+00DC>ter]] is then sent to detention and made into a German meal called "<U+00DC>terbraten". Bart and Lisa figure out what the teachers are doing, but one by one, the kids are "sent to detention" where they are caged and butchered. The kids try to get Marge to help, but she instead tells them that they must stand up for themselves ("Look them in the eye and say, 'Don't eat me'.")  Eventually Bart, Lisa and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] are the only students left, besides [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]], and they decide to escape. Skinner and the other teachers corner them on a ledge above a giant operating blender. Willie tries to help the students, but is killed with an axe in the back by Skinner. Before he dies, he sways and moans: "Oh, I'm bad at this!" He then collapses, dead. Milhouse, Bart, and Lisa fall to their dooms. Bart wakes up to find it was all a terrible dream. Marge assures him that he has nothing to be afraid of. Except that mysterious green fog that turns people inside out.  The fog seeps through the window and the Simpsons are turned inside out.  They perform a bloody song and dance number as the credits roll.

==Production==
[[David Mirkin]] tried to put "as much blood and guts" into the episode as he could. This was because Mirkin was angry about complaints by the [[United States Congress]] about the amount of violence in the show and their attempting to [[censorship|censor]] it. He later called it "the most [...] disturbing Halloween show ever". The opening sequence, in which Marge states the episode cannot be shown and plays some live action stock footage, was also in reaction to this. Mirkin said he believes Halloween shows can be "scary as well as fun".<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror V"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

This episode marks the end of the tradition of using humorous tombstones in the title sequence of Halloween episodes. This sequence contained a tombstone that reads "Amusing Tombstones", which was the writers' way of showing that they were tired of coming up with ideas for humorous tombstone messages. Similar sequences had been used as introductions in all four previous ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes, but have not been used since this episode.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror V"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The staff also decided against continuing the tradition of using wraparound segments that were used before each story in the previous ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes, to make more time for the main stories.<ref name="Weinstein7">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The first segment, ''The Shinning'', was inspired by the film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', and is basically a parody of that film. The film's director, [[Stanley Kubrick]], had been a big influence on the writer, and was "one of the main reason [he] wanted to be a director". Ironically, series creator [[Matt Groening]] admitted that he had not seen ''The Shining'' and most of the references to the film were entirely lost on him.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror V"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

[[File:David X. Cohen by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|This episode marked [[David X. Cohen|David Cohen]]'s debut as a Simpsons writer.|alt=A closeup of a man in front of a microphone. He has a receding hairline and wears dark-framed glasses.]]

Matt Groening originally pitched the idea that Homer would travel through time in ''Time and Punishment''. His original idea was that the time-travel would be the result of Homer simply jamming his hand in the toaster, but the other writers rejected that.<ref name="Groening"/> Scenes where Homer is in the past were written so that he is there for the time it takes to toast a piece of bread. Mirkin gave [[Mister Peabody|Peabody and Sherman]] a cameo appearances in this segment, which was due to the show ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|Rocky and His Friends]]'' being a major influence on ''The Simpsons''.

The first time Homer travels back in time, he was originally supposed to state "I'm the first non-[[fiction]]al character to travel backwards through time".<ref name="Cohen"/> The line was later changed from "non-fictional" to "non-Brazilian". Groening was confused as to the reason for the change, since he liked the original so much. In fact, he didn't even understand what the new line meant.<ref name="Groening"/>

In the scene where the Simpsons' house changes into various different things, one of the original designs was the house made entirely of [[squirrel]]s. The layout artist who designed it worked on the drawings for more than two days, but ultimately it was cut. To make sure their work did not go to waste, some staff members have used the drawings on Christmas cards and other studio-related notices.<ref name="Reardon">{{cite video | people=Reardon, Jim|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror V"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

In another deleted scene involving an alternate Simpsons future, the Simpsons had a teenage son named Roy.<ref name="Daniels">{{cite video | people=Daniels, Greg|date=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror V"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Groening said that "somebody from outside the show" originally suggested the idea.<ref name="Groening"/> The joke was later used as a sub-plot for the episode "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]", although Roy was a [[wikt:lodger|lodger]] in that episode, rather than a son.<ref name="Cohen"/>

''Nightmare Cafeteria'' was the first Simpsons story to be written by [[David X. Cohen]].<ref name="Mirkin"/> He wrote the final scene where a nightmarish fog turns the family "inside out". This was inspired by a thriller featured on the radio show ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'' called ''The Dark'', which scared Cohen as a child. A dance number was added immediately afterwards in order to end the show on a lighter note. He also cut two scenes from this segment feature Sherri and Terri being cooked as "[[Teriyaki]]" steak with "[[Sherry]]" sauce and Homer regaling Lisa about his dream of eating Milhouse. Nevertheless, a book from this scene was used in this segment. As a result of this scene being cut, Homer does not appear in the third segment, something Cohen believed to be unprecedented at the time.<ref name="Cohen"/> The "grade F meat" joke was written by Mirkin, inspired by his cousin once seeing a box of [[hot dog]]s labeled "grade C, approved for human consumption".<ref name="Mirkin"/>

==Cultural references==
The voice over in the pre-title sequence is a reference to ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> The first segment ''The Shinning'' is a parody of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' and the [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[The Shining (film)|film]] of the same name.  The basic plot of the segment is the same as the novel and there are also many references to specific moment from the film, such as the blood coming out of the elevator and Homer breaking though a door with an axe and yelling "Here's Johnny".<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="book"/>

The plot of the second segment ''Time and Punishment'', where Homer causes major changes in the future by killing animals in the past, is a parody of the [[Ray Bradbury]] short story "[[A Sound of Thunder]]".<ref name="Mirkin"/> [[Mister Peabody|Peabody and Sherman]] from the animated series ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', make an appearance during Homer's time traveling sequence.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The dinosaur scenes are reminiscent of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'',<ref name="BBC"/> and the floor morphing into a television screen is a reference to similar scenes in both ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[Time Bandits]]''.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The title of the third segment ''Nightmare Cafeteria'', is a reference to the television series ''[[Nightmare Cafe]]''.<ref name="Cohen"/> The song sung over the end credits is based on the song "One" from the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]''.<ref name="BBC"/>

==Reception and legacy==
The episode is often considered one of the best Simpsons Halloween episodes ever. It finished ninth on a list by the magazine ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' of its top 25 ''Simpsons'' episodes. In it, ''The Shinning'' segment was described as "a parody [...] with such detail [and] comic timing" and that it "ranks with the great [...] spoofs of all time", and the ''Time and Punishment'' segment as "one of the most beautifully random moments in ''[The] Simpsons'' history", but also said that the ''Nightmare Cafeteria'' segment "doesn't shine as brilliantly".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_2,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2007-03-03|date=2003-01-29|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> It ranked fifth on AskMen.com's "Top 10: Simpsons Episodes" list.
