'''Florence Violet McKenzie''' [[OBE]] (''n<U+00E9>e'' '''Granville'''; 1890<U+2013>1982), affectionately known as "Mrs Mac", was Australia's first female [[electrical engineer]], founder of the [[Women's Emergency Signalling Corps]] (WESC) and lifelong promoter for technical education for women.<ref name="DoS">{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/mckenzie_violet |title = McKenzie, Violet | author = Catherine Freyne | date = 2010 |work = Dictionary of Sydney |publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust |accessdate = 05 January 2012}}</ref> She campaigned successfully to have some of her female trainees accepted into the all-male Navy, thereby originating the [[Women's Royal Australian Naval Service]] (WRANS).<ref name="womenaustralia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0386b.htm|title=McKenzie, Florence Violet (1892<U+2013>1982)|work=The Australian Women's Register|year=2010|accessdate=2011-04-08}}</ref> Some 12,000 servicemen passed through her signal instruction school in [[Sydney]], acquiring skill in [[Morse code]] and visual signalling ([[flag semaphore]] and [[International Code of Signals]]).<ref name="Who's who">{{Citation | title=Who's Who in Australia | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Herald and Weekly Times Ltd | edition=15th ed. / compiled and edited by Joseph A.

She set up her own electrical contracting business in 1918, and [[apprentice]]d herself to it, in order to meet the requirements of the Diploma in Electrical Engineering at [[Sydney Technical College]] and in 1922 she was the first Australian woman to take out an [[amateur radio operator]]'s license. Through the 1920s and 1930s, her "Wireless Shop" in Sydney's Royal Arcade was renowned amongst Sydney radio experimenters and hobbyists. She founded ''[[The Wireless Weekly]]'' in 1922, established the [[Electrical Association for Women]] in 1934, and wrote the first "all-electric [[cookbook]]" in 1936. She also corresponded with [[Albert Einstein]] in the postwar years.<ref name="HJS">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2009/2451146.htm |title=Hindsight <U+2013> 18 January 2009 <U+2013> Signals, currents, and wires: the untold story of Florence Violet McKenzie |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2009-01-18 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref>

==Family and education==
Florence Violet McKenzie was born Florence Violet Granville on 28 September 1890 in [[Melbourne]], although before her marriage to Cecil McKenzie at the age of 34 , she was known as Violet Wallace.<ref name="DoS" /> Other sources cite 1892 as her birth year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Anne|title=McKenzie, Florence Violet (1892<U+2013>1982)|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0386b.htm|work=The Australian Women's Register|publisher=The National Foundation for Australian Women|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> Wallace was her stepfather George's surname; he was a commercial traveller. When Violet was an infant, the family moved to [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]], south of [[Sydney]].

}}
From a young age, Violet had an independent interest in electricity and invention. As she recalled in an oral history interview in 1979:
<blockquote>I used to play about with bells and buzzers and things around the house. My mother would sometimes say "Oh, come and help me find something, it's so dark in this cupboard" <U+2013> she didn't have very good eyesight<U+2026> So I'd get a battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a light would come on<U+2026> I started sort of playing with those things.<ref name="Oralinterview">{{cite book|title=Interview with Florence Violet McKenzie at Glenwood Nursing Home, Greenwich|author=Louise Lansley and Islay Wybenga of the [[Sydney Girls' High School|Sydney High Old Girls' Union]]|date=1979-09-08}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref></blockquote>

From [[Thirroul, New South Wales|Thirroul]] school, McKenzie won a bursary to study at [[Sydney Girls' High School]]. In 1915 she passed Chemistry I and Geology I at the [[University of Sydney]],<ref>{{Citation | author1=University of Sydney | title=Calendar of the University of Sydney for the year 1916| publication-date=1888-1942 | publisher=Gibbs, Shallard &amp; Co | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13098848 | accessdate=3 January 2012 }}, pp 429<U+2013>30. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> then approached the [[Sydney Technical College]] in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] to enrol in the Diploma of Electrical Engineering. In December 1923, McKenzie graduated from the Sydney Technical College. She later gave her Diploma <U+2013> the first of its kind awarded in Australia to a woman <U+2013> to the collection of the [[Powerhouse Museum]], also in Ultimo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://from.ph/262414 |title=K50 Diploma, Electrical Engineering, awarded to Miss Florence Violet Wallace (married name Mrs F V McKenzie) on 31-12-1923|author=Powerhouse Museum |accessdate=13 November 2011 |publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Australia}}</ref>

[[File:Violet McKenzie and husband Cecil McKenzie.png|thumb|left|Violet McKenzie and husband Cecil McKenzie c1935]]
Cecil Roland McKenzie was a young electrical engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. He too was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's customers at the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]] on [[New Years Eve]] 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, [[Greenwich, New South Wales|Greenwich]] complete with a wireless room in the attic.<ref name="Dale">{{cite news|last=Dale|first=Marie|title=The Radio Girl 'tunes in' to many interests|newspaper=[[The Australian Woman's Mirror]]|date=21 July 1925|page=20}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> The house remains, but has been extensively renovated since the McKenzies lived there.

The McKenzies had no children of their own, but sometimes took in the two sons of Violet's only sibling, Walter Reginald Wallace, from Melbourne. According to the [[Sands Directory]] these boys, Merton Reginald Wallace and Lindsay Gordon Wallace, later operated their own radio shop in [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]], Melbourne.<ref>{{Citation | title=Sands &amp; McDougall's Melbourne, suburban and country directory | publication-date=1862 | publisher=Melbourne | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36461848 | accessdate=3 January 2012 }}.

==Early employment and interests==
[[File:Crowd outside McKenzie's wireless shop.png|thumb|right|The Wireless Shop<br> Miss F.V. Wallace, electrical engineer]]
Throughout her studies, Miss Wallace worked as an electrical contractor, installing electricity in private houses, such as that of politician [[Archdale Parkhill]] in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], and in factories and commercial premises, including the Standard Steam Laundry on Dowling Street, [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]].{{cite news |title= Self made success |author= |url= |newspaper= Sunday Guardian|date= 20 October 1929}} She was an enthusiastic [[ham radio]] operator, being the first licensed woman in the country and with the call sign "2GA" (later changed to "VK2FV").<ref name="Ozatwar">{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=Peter|title=Women's Emergency Signalling CORPS IN AUSTRALIA DURING WWII|url=http://www.ozatwar.com/sigint/wesc.htm|publisher=Ozatwar.com|accessdate=21 November 2011|year=2006}}</ref> In 1922 Miss Wallace opened "The Wireless Shop" <U+2013> billing itself as "the oldest radio shop in town"<ref>{{cite news|title=Advertisement for The Wireless Shop|newspaper=The Wireless Weekly|date=24 November 1933|page=20}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> <U+2013> in the [[Royal Arcade, Sydney|Royal Arcade]] (which ran from George Street through to Pitt Street <U+2013> replaced in the 1970s by the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel).<ref>Ric Havyatt quoted in {{cite news|last=Begbie|first=Richard|title=The Marvellous Mrs Mac, alias FV Wallace <U+2013> Part 1|newspaper=Radio Waves|date=October 2008|page=7}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> McKenzie later said it was schoolboys visiting her shop who first introduced her to Morse code.<ref name="Oralinterview" /> Australia's first weekly radio magazine was conceived at the shop, by Miss Wallace and three co-founders. "The Wireless Weekly" eventually became [[Electronics Australia]],<ref name="Ozatwar" /> and remained in circulation until 2001.<ref name="DoS" />

[[File:Violet McKenzie with wireless.png|thumb|left|McKenzie working with the wireless radio c1922]]
In 1924 McKenzie became the only female member of the [[Wireless Institute of Australia]].<ref name="Radi">{{cite book |title= 200 Australian Women: A Redress Anthology|last= Broomham|first= Rosemary| editor= Heather Radi|year= 1988|publisher= Women's Redress Press|location= Broadway NSW|isbn= 0958960372|page= 179}} </ref> That same year she travelled to the United States for business reasons, and in San Francisco was welcomed at radio 6KGO: 'Miss Wallace, an electrical engineer from Australia, will now talk from the studio.' She reportedly used her time on air to comment on the difference between the tram systems in San Francisco and those in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news|title=Miss Wallace speaks from 6 KGO|newspaper=The Australasian Wireless Review|date=December 1924|page=37}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> In 1931 she also notes that that she experimented with improving the science of television through the use of [[chemistry]]:
<blockquote>
"[I] have a pronounced kink for television work and devote most of my spare time in experimenting that branch of the science. Have a deep-rooted conviction that chemistry is going to provide the solution and am working along those lines."<ref>{{cite news|author=F.V. McKenzie|newspaper=The Wireless Weekly|date=3 April 1931}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref>
</blockquote>

The McKenzies had a mutual interest in [[tropical fish]] and had an enormous fish pond in the front yard.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1982|page=6}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> She spoke of heating water electrically to house tropical fish at home in the early 1920s, and of having given talks on radio 2FC about tropical fish in the days when she was doing electrical contracting work.<ref name="Oralinterview" /> In January 1933 the American journal [[Aquariana]] published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Mrs F. Violet|title=Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores|journal=Aquariana|year=1933|month=January|volume=1|issue=7|pages=160<U+2013>1}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref>

==Women's technical education==
[[File:The Electrical Association for Women.png|thumb|The rooms of the Electrical Association for Women, c1936. McKenzie sitting at the piano]]
In the 1930s, McKenzie turned her attention increasingly to teaching other women about electricity and radio. She had observed the need over years of working in the field herself. In 1925, she told the [[Australian Women's Mirror]]: "[T]here are such a lot of women experimenters [amongst my customers] that I would like to form a Women's Wireless Club.'<ref name="Dale" /> In 1931 she told a [[Sunday Sun]] reporter that she wanted to see a course of lectures on domestic radio and electricity established in girls' schools and technical colleges.<ref>{{cite news|title=Careers for girls <U+2013> Radio offers wide field|newspaper=Sunday Sun|date=1 February 1931}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> The following year she took matters into her own hands, opening a Women's Radio College on Phillip Street in 1932. She persuaded employers to take on some of her trainees, as one of them later recalled:

<blockquote>During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's electrical school in Phillip Street. It was the first time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac decided it was time to use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Other memories of Mrs Mac|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1982|pages=9}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref></blockquote>

McKenzie believed that electricity could save women from domestic drudgery, writing that... "To see every woman emancipated from the "heavy" work of the household by the aid of electricity is in itself a worthy object."<ref>{{cite news|last=McKenzie|first=Florence Violet|title=What have the ladies to say?|newspaper=[[The Contactor]]|date=8 November 1935|page=7}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> To this end in 1934 she founded an educational initiative, the [[Electrical Association for Women]] (EAW) at 170 King Street, later moving to 9 Clarence Street. 

By 1936, McKenzie had sold the Wireless Shop, and was busy at the Electrical Association for Women. She gave electric cooking demonstrations in the EAW kitchen, which was fitted out with show electrical appliances by the Sydney County Council.<ref name="Oralinterview" /> She compiled the EAW Cookery Book, Australia's first "all-electric" cookery book, which ran into seven editions and remained in print until 1954.<ref>{{Citation | author=McKenzie, F. V. (Florence Violet) | author2=Association for Electrical Development | title=The all electric cookery book | publication-date=1954 | publisher=Associated General Publications | edition=7th ed | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6398597 | accessdate=19 November 2011 }}</ref> She wrote an illustrated book for children about electrical safety called ''The Electric Imps'' in 1938.<ref name="Who's who" />

==Women's Emergency Signalling Corps==
[[File:The Women's Emergency Signalling Corps.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers entering WESC c1940 to receive signals training]]
As [[World War II]] loomed, McKenzie saw that with her qualifications and teaching skills she could make a valuable contribution. She foresaw a military demand for people with skills in wireless communications. As she told the [[Australian Women's Weekly]] in 1978: "When Neville Chamberlain came back from Munich and said '[[Peace for our time|Peace in our time]]' ''[sic]'', I began preparing for war."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article0 |title=Thank you, Mrs Mac|last=Flynn|first=Gregg|newspaper=[[Australian Women's Weekly|The Australian Women's Weekly (1933<U+2013>1982)]] |location=1933<U+2013>1982 |date=12 July 1978 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In July 1938, McKenzie was one of 80 women in attendance at the inaugural meeting of the Australian Women's Flying Corps (later known as the [[Australian Women's Flying Club]]) held at the Feminist Club of New South Wales at 77 King Street. McKenzie was appointed treasurer and instructor in Morse code to the organisation.<ref>{{Citation | author=Thomson, Joyce A. (Joyce Aubrey) | title=The WAAAF in wartime Australia | publication-date=1991 | page=32 | publisher=Melbourne University Press ; Portland, Or. : International Specialized Book Services | isbn=978-0-522-84435-1 }}</ref>

In 1939 McKenzie established the Women's Emergency Signalling Corps (WESC) in her Clarence Street rooms <U+2013> known affectionately as "Sigs". Her original idea was to train women in telegraphy so that they could replace men working in civilian communications, thereby freeing those skilled men up to serve in the war.<ref name="Ditty">{{cite news|last=McKenzie|first=Florence Violet|title=The Women's Emergency Signalling Corps|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1976}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> By the time war broke out, 120 women had been trained to instructional standard.<ref name="Ellison">{{cite news|last=Ellison|first=Norman|title=Magnificent Mrs Mac!|newspaper=Sky Script|page=14|month=April|year=1948}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> 

However, it quickly became apparent that men in the armed forces also urgently needed training in wireless communications and McKenzie's female trainees were in a position to train the male servicemen directly:
<blockquote>Early in the war, one young would-be pilot tried to enlist but was refused because he didn't know Morse code<U+2026>By sheer coincidence he walked past [the Women's Emergency Signalling Corps on Clarence Street] and heard the sounds of Morse signalling. "It was just a room full of women," remembered Mrs McKenzie, "but he walked up to me and said 'Will you teach me Morse code?' I just heaved a big sigh because I saw a whole world opening up in front of me. Then I knew what we could do. We could train girls to train the men. It was wonderful, because I'd thought we could only do things like relieving in the post office."<ref>"Mrs Mac' <U+2013> pioneer of the WRANS", newspaper clipping held in the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the Naval Heritage Centre, [[Spectacle Island (Port Jackson)|Spectacle Island]], ''publication unknown'', c1970s. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Members of WESC.jpg|thumb|left|Members of WESC]]
By the end of the war approximately 12,000 servicemen and recruits had been trained at the WESC school:
<blockquote> The Army sent lorry loads of soldiers to have early training in Morse before going to the Middle East, the RAAF sent several groups of servicemen in uniform, with their own instructor... to use our equipment. The Royal Indian Navy sent their Indian communication ratings<U+2026> Many RAN musterings came to the signalling school to improve their signalling. Scores of American servicemen attended the school, sometimes with their own instructor, but mostly to join our classes. More than forty police officers attended the school in their spare time to reach the necessary standard for enlisting as pilots in the RAAF.<ref name="Ditty" /></blockquote>

The premises at 9 Clarence Street became overcrowded, so McKenzie moved the operation to an old wool store at 10 Clarence Street, where for the next decade the WESC occupied the first and second floors, which she renovated with [[linoleum]] flooring and installed radio equipment for twelve classes. Sometimes [[military intelligence]] personnel would appear at the school with complaints from guests in the pub next door, who thought a spy operation was at work when they heard Morse code through the walls each evening.<ref>{{cite news|last=Small|first=Barbara|title=A woman engineer wrote our first electric cook book|newspaper=[[The National Times]]|date=26<U+2013>31 August 1974}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref>

McKenzie ran the school without any government grant or allocation of accommodation by the services. The women of the WESC each gave one [[Shilling (Australian)|shilling]] per week towards the rent.<ref name="DoS" /> No fees were ever charged for tuition as McKenzie said it was "her contribution to the war effort".<ref name="HJS" />

== Women's Royal Australian Naval Service==
[[File:Women<U+2019>s Emergency Signalling Corps members at Castle Hill c1939.png|thumb|Dressed in the practical green uniforms designed by McKenzie, Corps members spell out W E S C in [[flag semaphore]].]]
McKenzie campaigned energetically to have some of her female trainees accepted into the Air Force and Navy as [[telegraphist]]s. She encountered a great deal of official resistance. In 1940 she wrote to the Minister of the Navy (later to become Prime Minister), [[Billy Hughes|WM (Billy) Hughes]] saying "I would like to offer the services of our Signalling Corps, if not acceptable as telegraphists then at least as instructors."<ref name="Nelson">{{Citation | author=Nelson, Annette | author2=HMAS Harman (A.C.T.) | title=A history of HMAS Harman and its people : 1943<U+2013>1993 | page=26| publication-date=1993 | publisher=DC-C Publications | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10668727 | accessdate=19 November 2011 }}</ref> Despite her suggestion being dismissed, some time later McKenzie and six trainees were provided third-class train tickets to Melbourne to meet with the Naval Board for testing.<ref name="Ozatwar" />

In early January 1941, Commander Newman, the Navy's Director of Signals and Communications, visited the WESC headquarters on Clarence Street to test McKenzie's trainees. Finding they were highly proficient, he recommended the Navy admit them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ships Belles: The Story of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service 1941<U+2013>1985|last=Fenton Huie|first=Shirley|publisher=The Watermark Press|year= 2000|isbn= 0949284475}}</ref> Hughes still took some convincing. After McKenzie threatened to take her offer to the Air Force instead, the urgent need for trained telegraphists prevailed, and on 21 April a Navy Office letter authorised the entry of women into the Navy.<ref>{{cite news|title=1941<U+2013>1962: WRANS comes of age|newspaper=Royal Australian Navy News|date=24 April 1962|page=1}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> This was the beginning of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service <U+2013> the WRANS. The minister's condition was that "no publicity...be accorded this break with tradition'.<ref name="Nelson" />

On 28 April 1941, McKenzie accompanied 14 of her WESC trainees (twelve telegraphists and two domestic helpers). They had their medical test on 25 April and arrived at [[HMAS Harman]] in [[Canberra]] on 28 April 1941. The women were dressed in their green WESC uniform which had been designed by McKenzie herself<ref>{{cite news|last=Newton|first=Gloria|title=Ex-WRANS plan get-together for 30th anniversary|newspaper=Women's Weekly|date=10 March 1971|page=15}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> <U+2013> it was several months before a female Navy uniform was ready.<ref name="Nelson" /> Francis Proven became WRANS number 1. From this initial intake of 14, the WRANS ranks expanded to some 2,600 by the end of the war, representing about 10 per cent of the entire Royal Australian Naval force at the time.<ref>Margaret Curtis-Otter, W.R.A.N.S.: The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, The Naval Historical Society of Australia, Garden Island NSW, 1975, p 5. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> All told, McKenzie trained about 3,000 women, one-third of whom went into the services.<ref name="Radi" /> Many others remained at the Clarence Street school as instructors.

In May 1941, the Air Force appointed McKenzie as an honorary flight officer of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force,<ref>{{Citation | author=Thomson, Joyce A. (Joyce Aubrey) | title=The WAAAF in wartime Australia | publication-date=1991 | page=339 | publisher=Melbourne University Press ; Portland, Or. : International Specialized Book Services | isbn=978-0-522-84435-1 }}</ref> so she could legitimately instruct Air Force personnel.<ref>{{cite news|title=To 20,000 men and women she's 'Dear mother <U+2013> Mrs Mac'|newspaper=Australian Home Journal|date=July|year=1963|page=45}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> This was the only official recognition McKenzie received during the war for her efforts.

==Postwar wireless training==
Violet McKenzie helped with rehabilitation after the war, keeping her school open for as long as there was a need for instruction in wireless signalling. In the postwar years, she trained men from the merchant navy, pilots in commercial aviation, and others needing the trade qualification known as a "signaller's ticket". In 1948, a reporter from ''Sky Script'' visit to the school and described the scene, and the diversity of students:

[[File:Violet McKenzie with overseas naval personnel.png|thumb|right|Mrs McKenzie with overseas naval personnel, c1953]]
<blockquote>At a table in a corner recently there were six elementary trainees: One was a Chinese quartermaster, another a half-Burmese. Two were Americans <U+2026> One <U+2026> an aircraft skipper down from New Guinea to get his wireless ticket; and the other chap a ship's officer with the same objective. In another corner there's an ANA commander preparing for his 20-word-a-minute exam: an English ship's wireless officer...an ex-RAF Wing-Commander...an Indian Navy man... [and] groups of airline 'types' also on the job.<ref name="Ellison" /></blockquote>

McKenzie told a journalist that, after the war, "All the airmen came back and wanted to join Qantas, but they needed to build up their Morse speed and learn to use the modern equipment."<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs Mac is truly special|newspaper=Reveille|date=April|year=1979|page=13}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> The Department of [[Civil Aviation]] fitted out a room at the school with transmitters, receivers and [[radio compass]] so that pilots could train for their wireless ticket at the school. From 1948, McKenzie held a First Class Flight Radio Telephony Operator License. 

One of the ex-RAAF airmen who retrained for a civilian career with McKenzie wrote:
<blockquote>Being unemployed, we spent almost all of each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She required no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true to say that a great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.<ref>Letter from AR Gray to ex-WRAN Jess Prain, 31 July 1987, held in the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the Naval Heritage Centre, [[Spectacle Island (Port Jackson)|Spectacle Island]]. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref></blockquote>

Famous aviators who trained for their wireless ticket at McKenzie's school include [[Patrick Gordon Taylor]] and [[Cecil Arthur Butler]]. McKenzie also trained [[Mervyn Wood]], later Commissioner of Police in New South Wales, and the principals of the Navigation Schools at both the Melbourne and Sydney Technical Colleges.<ref>Resume of FV McKenzie's achievements prepared by the Ex-WRANS Association and held in the archives of the Ex-WRANS Association at the Naval Heritage Centre, [[Spectacle Island (Port Jackson)|Spectacle Island]]. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref>

According to a People magazine profile of McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from the owners of 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The [[Sands Directory]] indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.<ref name="Ditty" />

==Later life==
===Correspondence with Einstein===
In early 1949 McKenzie started writing to [[Albert Einstein]]. Her first letter to him wished him a speedy recovery from recent illness.<ref>Letter from FV McKenzie to Albert Einstein, 7 February 1949, held in the Albert Einstein Archives, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> Two of her letters are held in the Einstein archives in Jerusalem. It is clear from the second letter that he wrote back to her at least once. Some accounts claim that McKenzie corresponded regularly with Einstein for as long as 15 years before his death in 1955,<ref name="Dot">{{cite news|title=A Dot with a Dash|newspaper=[[People (Australian magazine){{!}}People]]|date=28 January 1953|page=23}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> but the documentary record suggests such reports exaggerate the extent of the correspondence. She also sent him several gifts over the years including shells (for his daughter) that airmen would collect across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] on her request<ref name="Oralinterview" /> and a boomerang which had been brought to her from Central Australia by an airline pilot. She wrote that, "Some of your mathematical friends might like to plot its flight!"<ref>Letter from FV McKenzie to Albert Einstein, 28 February 1949, held in the Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref> There are other reports that she sent him a [[didgeridoo]], and a recording of didgeridoo music when he replied that he couldn't work out how to play the instrument.<ref name="Dot" />

===Final years===
Violet McKenzie was nine years older than her husband Cecil, but she outlived him by 23 years. After his death in 1958, she shared her house for a time with Cecil's sister Jean, a primary school teacher. In May 1977, after a stroke paralysed her right side and confined her to a wheelchair, McKenzie moved to the nearby Glenwood Nursing Home. She died peacefully in her sleep on 23 May 1982. At her funeral service, held at the Church of St Giles in Greenwich, 24 serving WRANS formed a Guard of Honour. McKenzie was cremated at the [[Northern Suburbs Crematorium]]. The June 1982 edition of the newsletter of the Ex-WRANS Association was devoted to their former teacher and patron. Amongst the memories recorded therein is a statement McKenzie made two days before she died: "...it is finished, and I have proved to them all that women can be as good as, or better than men."<ref>{{cite news|title=Other memories of Mrs Mac|newspaper=Ex-WRANS Ditty Box|date=June 1982|pages=11}} Cited in ''Dictionary of Sydney''.</ref>
