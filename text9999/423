Every train set is named after a [[Scania|scanian]] person of significance, both real and fictional.

The '''Sk<U+00E5>ne Commuter Rail''' ({{lang-sv|P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>gen}}) is a [[commuter rail]] system in [[Sk<U+00E5>ne County]], [[Sweden]]. The system also acts as a [[regional rail]] system, as it serves other cities over {{convert|100|km}} from the principal city of Malm<U+00F6>.

==Lines==
=== Lines inside Sk<U+00E5>ne ===
''Local trains, called P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>g''

There are six (unnumbered) lines in the P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>gen system, from Hyllie in southern [[Malm<U+00F6>]] to [[Helsingborg]]/[[<U+00C4>ngelholm]] (2 different paths), [[H<U+00F6><U+00F6>r]] and [[Ystad]]/[[Simrishamn]], and from Helsingborg to [[<U+00C5>storp]] and [[Kristianstad]]. 

* Hyllie - Malm<U+00F6> Central - Lund - Esl<U+00F6>v - H<U+00F6><U+00F6>r
* Hyllie - Malm<U+00F6> Central - Lund - ''Landskrona'' - Helsingborg (- <U+00C4>ngelholm)
* Hyllie - Malm<U+00F6> Central - Lund - ''Teckomatorp'' - Helsingborg
* Malm<U+00F6> Central - Ystad - Simrishamn
* Helsingborg - <U+00C5>storp - H<U+00E4>ssleholm - Kristianstad
* Helsingborg - <U+00C5>storp
(major stations only, the internal local trains stops at smaller stations as well)

=== Sk<U+00E5>netrafiken lines going outside Sk<U+00E5>ne ===
''Regional trains, called <U+00D6>resundst<U+00E5>g'' (starting from [[Helsing<U+00F8>r]])

The [[Oresundtrain|<U+00D6>resund Trains]] that cross the [[Oresund]] always depart from [[Elsinore]], go via [[Copenhagen]] and the largest airport in Scandinavia, [[Kastrup]], and serve as regional trains in Sk<U+00E5>ne County and beyond. In Denmark, they serve as suburban trains on the Copenhagen commuter rail network, but not in Sweden, where they are semi-fast regional trains.

* from Denmark => Hyllie - Triangeln - Malm<U+00F6> Central - Lund - Landskrona - Helsingborg - <U+00C4>ngelholm => Halland County => Gothenburgh
* from Denmark => Hyllie - Triangeln - Malm<U+00F6> Central - Lund - H<U+00E4>ssleholm - Kristianstad - Brom<U+00F6>lla => Blekinge County (to Karlskrona)
* from Denmark => Hyllie - Triangeln - Malm<U+00F6> Central - Lund - Esl<U+00F6>v - H<U+00F6><U+00F6>r - H<U+00E4>ssleholm - Osby => Sm<U+00E5>land County (to Kalmar)

=== Other trains ===
''DSB-Inter City trains'' (starts from Copenhagen Central station)
* from Copenhagen => Svedala - Skurup - Ystad => connects to a ferry to [[Bornholm]], a Danish island in the Baltic Sea.
''SJ'' (Swedish National Rail) only operates to/from Sk<U+00E5>ne - '''not''' inside. SJ trains stop only at four stations in Sk<U+00E5>ne.
* Malm<U+00F6> Central
* Lund
* Helsingborg
* H<U+00E4>ssleholm

===Facts===
* The lines are not numbered (yet). Some time tables may be numbered, but the numbers are not shown on the trains.
* The regional train network are officially named "<U+00D6>resundst<U+00E5>g".
* The local train network are officially named "P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>g".
* These names are, however, also unofficially used for the train types (officially called [[Oresundtrain|X31]], [[SL X10|X11]] and [[SL X60#X61|X61]]). Some "<U+00D6>resundst<U+00E5>g" vehicles (X31) runs as local "P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>g", and others run as intercity trains, which is a bit confusing even for the locals.
* A tunnel under Malm<U+00F6>, [[Citytunneln]], was opened in December 2010.
* The county has at present 54 stations, all tracks are electrified, but only half of the track length is dual track.
* There are three different ticket systems, one for traveling inside the Sk<U+00E5>ne county and another for traveling to the Copenhagen metropolitan area, and a third for  <U+00D6>resundst<U+00E5>g to places north of Sk<U+00E5>ne.
* The ticket systems differ in the fare zones only, all tickets can be bought in machines at the stations.
* Tickets for travel to other counties can be bought in machines at <U+00D6>resundst<U+00E5>g stations, through SJ, or through the internet; the same applies to travel to Denmark outside the Copenhagen metropolitan area.
* DSB and SJ have their own separate ticket systems, not compatible with the Sk<U+00E5>netrafiken system. SJ can sell tickets for Sk<U+00E5>netrafiken trains.
* Typically trains on local lines run every hour and the regional lines twice every hour.
* There is a bug in the ticketing system when buying with a discount (Jojo) card, and a different origin station is specified. This can occur if the passenger holds a 'period' card (weekly or monthly pass) for part of the route. If the passenger buys a ticket from Malm<U+00F6> to Kastrup, but from a Lund station ticket vending machine, the passenger will be charged the non-discounted price. The counter staff will credit the passenger's card with the difference, on presentation of the ticket.

==Rolling stock==
The P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>g rolling stock is owned by [[Sk<U+00E5>netrafiken]], although the operation (staff and licences etc.) is carried out by [[Arriva]].

Most P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>g trains are of type [[SL X10|X11]] but demand has grown, necessitating the addition of other available train types to the roster. Some [[Bombardier Regina]] type train sets have been rented from other train owners. The type [[Oresundtrain|X31]], normally used for the Oresundtrain traffic to Denmark, is also used sometimes. Sk<U+00E5>netrafiken has ordered 49 new [[SL X60|Alstom Coradia/X61]] sets, a variant of the type used in Stockholm. Several of them have been used on revenue services since August 2010. Sk<U+00E5>netrafiken plans to sell most of the X11 trains during 2011, and use the X61 trains as P<U+00E5>gat<U+00E5>g. The X11 trains do not fulfill all the safety requirements for the City tunnel and have a temporary exception from the rules.

The rolling stock for Oresundtrain is of type X31 only, and these trains are owned by the <U+00D6>resundst<U+00E5>g company, partially owned by Sk<U+00E5>netrafiken.
