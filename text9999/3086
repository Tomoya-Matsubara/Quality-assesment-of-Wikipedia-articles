==Early life==
Nestor was born on June 24, 1880, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], her father owned a grocery store there, but due to the depression of the 1890s he returned to his old trade as a [[machinist]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> In spring of 1897 Agnes and the rest of her family followed after their father and headed to Chicago; Agnes, still in her teens, found work in Chicago<U+2019>s Eisendrath Glove Company (a non-union shop).<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> In her autobiography ''Woman's Labor Leader'',  Nestor discusses the company<U+2019>s unjust practices such as: the company charged workers fifty cents a week for machine rental, workers had to provide their own needles (and if somebody was to break a needle they were charged for a new one to replace it), and also workers had to purchase their own machine oil, however, these unjust practices would not go unchallenged. In 1902 Nestor stepped forward as leader in a strike of women workers at the Eisendrath Glove Company (encouraged and supported by the [[Trade union|unionised]] men), which lasted ten days. The strike was successful, all the women's demands were met; workers received a raise in pay, no longer had to pay rent for their machines, and the Eisendrath company took greater responsibility for their machinery, its greatest outcome being the implementation of a union shop.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref>

==Activism==

===International Glove Workers Union and the Women's Trade Union League===
Following the success of the strike, Nestor took on more leadership roles. In 1902, the same small organization of women who took part in the Eisendrath Glove Company strike would became the [[International Glove Workers Union]] (IGWU), with Agnes Nestor as a founder and leader. Nestor was the national vice president of the International Glove Workers Union from 1903 to 1906, secretary-treasurer from 1906 to 1913, general president from 1913 to 1915, vice-president, again, from 1915 to 1938, and director of research and education from 1938 until her death in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mcmillan|first=Peter|title=Agnes Nestor|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAWnestor.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational Publishers Ltd|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref> As a leader in the International Glove Workers Union, Nestor gained prominence among labor leaders and earned access to network with notable women in Chicago society, many of whom she met through her involvement with [[women's clubs]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> Though there were differences between "club women" and "working women," particularly in terms of class, domestic roles, and educational attainment, the relationship and outreach efforts Nestor built with club women were to further the agenda of the International Glove Workers Union.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>

Nestor was also an active member of the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL) of Chicago beginning in 1903, and served as its president from 1913 to 1948.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/ |title=Working Her Fingers to the Bone: Agnes Nestor<U+2019>s Story |accessdate=2010-09-17 |quote= |publisher= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100817092630/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5728/| archivedate= 17 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Unlike other women's clubs, the Women's Trade Union League admitted women regardless of class,<ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> the club's aim was to secure the organization of all women workers of the U.S. into [[trade unions]] in the hopes of gaining better working conditions, a reduced work day, a living wage, and full citizenship of women.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> At the Women's Trade Union League, Nestor worked alongside prominent women labor leaders [[Mary Kenny O'Sullivan]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Mary McDowell]], [[Margaret Haley]], [[Helen Marot]], [[Florence Kelley]], and [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]], together they were able to lobby, organize, fundraise, and create the WTUL into an influential and transformative organization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mcmillan|first=Peter|title=Agnes Nestor|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAWnestor.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational Publishers Ltd|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>

The Women's Trade Union League seal exhibits the phrases "The Eight Hour Day," "A Living Wage," and "To Guard the Home," thereby conveying the message that the WTUL believed that in advocating for reduced work hours, and raising wages, women workers would be able to better attend domestic responsibilities at home.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> They would come to work diligently to achieve the status they longed for displayed on their seal. For many years attempts were made by various labor groups to enact legislation to protect women workers from overlong working hours, from the dangers of unprotected machinery, and sweatshop conditions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> The WTUL took action in composing a bill that would make the previous goals attainable, the bill called for an [[eight-hour day]]. They worked for three years gathering reports on conditions under which women were working, including unorganized women who did factory work in their own homes (these women had no standard wages, and payments ranged, the poorer the woman the worse the tragedies).<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> The reports were presented in the Women's Trade Union League's first exhibit, which was called "Exhibit of Dyanamic Sweatshops," they presented the eight-hour day bill as a health measure, because it was on those grounds that the Oregon ten-hour day was passed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> The bill did not pass, Senator Jones suggested they exclude hotel and restaurant workers from the protection of the proposed law, and accept a ten-hour day, the WTUL refused to exclude any working women but did accept the ten-hour day, thus, in 1909 passed the Illinois ten-hour day (their proposed eight-hour day would be reached in 1937).<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> 
The topic of education for working women was just as crucial to the WTUL, they created an education program for working girls, in hopes of providing them with opportunities to explore cultural avenues which they had been denied from.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> In 1917, they worked out a plan with the Chicago Board of Education for the use of the classrooms of public schools (when they were not in use) to hold classes for the working women, Nestor particularly helped work out a course in the history of the trade-union movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref> In 1918, Nestor joined a group organized by [[Samuel Gompers]] to travel on a Labor mission to [[Europe]], the purpose of the mission was to cultivate international relationships between labor groups in the United States and in Europe and to demonstrate the readiness to help war-stricken Europe and cooperate once [[World War I]] ended.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nestor|first=Agnes|title=Woman's Labor Leader:An Autobiography of Agnes Nestor|year=1954|publisher=Bellevue Books Publishing Company|location=Rockford, IL}}</ref>

By the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] would have effected both the WTUL and the IGWU financially, the latter suffered greater than the former.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> Even with such setback, Nestor continued her work as a labor leader and spent a lot of time fundraising for the unions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> In the last decade of her life Nestor never retired, rather she spent her remaining years recruiting unorganized glove workers, and preventing the relaxation of labor laws during [[World War II]] <ref>{{cite web|last=Grivois-Shah|first=Timothy Michael|title=Agnes Nestor: Labor Leader, Politician, and Social Reformer--A Portrait of a Leader|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1351&context=luc_diss|publisher=Dissertations.Paper 352.|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>
