The '''Kennedy half dollar''', first minted in 1964, is a currently struck [[Half dollar (United States coin)|fifty cent coin]] issued by the [[United States Mint]].  Intended as a memorial to the assassinated President [[John F. Kennedy]], it was authorized by Congress just over a month after his death.  Use of existing works by Mint sculptors [[Gilroy Roberts]] and [[Frank Gasparro]] allowed [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] to be prepared quickly, and striking of the new coins began in January 1964.

The coins vanished from circulation soon after their release in April 1964 due to collectors, hoarders, and those interested in a memento of the late president.  Although the Mint greatly increased production, the denomination still failed to circulate.  Continued rises in the price of silver increased the hoarding<U+2014>many early Kennedy half dollars have been melted for their silver. The percentage of fine silver was reduced from 90% to 40% (silver clad), but even this change failed to get the coins to circulate significantly.

In 1971, silver was eliminated entirely from the coins.  A special design for the reverse of the half dollar was issued for the [[United States Bicentennial]] and was struck in 1975 and 1976.  In addition to [[business strike]]s, special collector coins were struck for the Bicentennial in silver clad; silver proof sets in which the dime, quarter and half dollar were struck in 90%&nbsp;silver were first minted in 1992.  Even though ample supplies of half dollars are now available, their circulation is extremely limited.  Since 2002, Kennedy half dollars have only been struck to satisfy the demand from collectors, and are available through the Mint.

In the interest of time (the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while [[Frank Gasparro]] began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal.<ref name="design"/> Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy.<ref name="design"/> After the Mint produced [[Pattern coin|trial strikes]], Jacqueline and [[Robert Kennedy]] were invited to view them.<ref name="design"/> Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly.<ref name="design"/> It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted that there was not enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.<ref name="design"/>

The Treasury Department made the coins available to the public beginning on March 24, 1964.  A line a block long formed at the department's windows in Washington to purchase the 70,000 coins initially allocated for public sale.  Although the department limited sales to 40 per customer, by the end of the day, the coins were gone, but the line had not shortened.  Banks in Boston and Philadelphia quickly rationed supplies, but still sold out by noon.  Sales in New York did not begin until the following day, and rationing was imposed there as well, to the disgruntlement of the head of the coin department at [[Gimbels]], the largest dealer in the city, which had hoped to sell the coins at a premium.<ref>Raymont, Henry.

The Mint struck Kennedy half dollars in large numbers in an attempt to meet the overwhelming demand.  The Treasury had initially planned to issue 91&nbsp;million half dollars for 1964, but raised the number to 141&nbsp;million.  However, a public announcement of the increase failed to cause more coins to actually circulate or to decrease the prices on the secondary market.<ref name = "nyt071964">Bardes, Herbert C.

These minting operations were rapidly depleting the Treasury's stock of silver.  Prices for the metal were rising to such an extent that, by early June, a dime contained 9.33 cents worth of silver at market prices.  On June 3, 1965, President Johnson announced plans to eliminate silver from the dime and quarter in favor of a clad sandwich with layers of copper-nickel on each side of a layer of pure copper.

=== Switch to base metal ===
In May 1969, the Treasury sought authorization to eliminate the half dollar's silver content, changing it to the same copper-nickel clad composition as the dime and quarter.  The Treasury also sought approval to strike base-metal dollar coins, which would fill a need for gaming tokens in Western casinos.  Former president [[Dwight Eisenhower]] had died recently, and there was discussion of placing Eisenhower's portrait on the dollar.  The Treasury hoped that with the removal of the silver content, the coin would cease to be hoarded and again circulate.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XRJSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pzQNAAAAIBAJ&dq=kennedy%20half%20dollar&pg=6091%2C2616341 "End of silver use in U.S. coins urged"].
