'''Hurricane Hilda''' was the third [[hurricane]] to make landfall in the [[United States]] during the [[1964 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Originating near Cuba, the [[cyclone]] intensified while moving through the Gulf of Mexico, and became a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] before striking [[Louisiana]] in early October. In combination with a [[weather front|frontal zone]] located across the Southeast [[United States]], the hurricane spread heavy rains through the South through the Carolinas into the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. Hilda led to significant damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as US$126&nbsp;million (1964&nbsp;dollars) in damage, and 38 deaths.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Hilda 1964 track.png}}
Hilda originated from a slow-moving easterly wave that was moving westward through the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name="HildaPg1">{{

}}</ref> On the morning of September 28, a weak cyclonic circulation formed just off of [[Cuba]] and intensified as it moved westward. It became a storm after passing the western tip of Cuba.<ref name="HildaPg1"/>

Hilda moved at about 9&nbsp;mph (14&nbsp;km/h) and entered the Gulf of Mexico, intensifying steadily.<ref name="HildaPg1"/> The storm reached hurricane status, reaching its peak intensity on October 1 of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h) and a minimal pressure of {{convert|941|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Hilda turned northward on October 1 at an average speed of 6&nbsp;mph (10&nbsp;km/h) for two days. Hilda made landfall in the central Louisiana coast on the evening of October 3. A decrease in intensity had occurred the day prior to landfall, but Hilda was still a major hurricane when it reached the [[Gulf Coast]]. After the eye moved inland, Hilda weakened rapidly, moving towards [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. The storm was forced eastward due to cold air and strong pressure rises.<ref name="HildaPg2">{{

Soon after the eastward turn, Hilda fell to tropical storm status and continued to weaken as cold air continued to enter the storm. Hilda became an extratropical low on October 5 over [[Mississippi]]. The low passed over [[Jacksonville, Florida]] and entered the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Preparations==
Over 2000 personnel from offshore oil rigs were evacuated on September 30 or October 1.<ref name="HildaPg4">{{

==Impact==
===Gulf of Mexico===
Hilda was the most damaging tropical cyclone to the offshore oil industry, at the time of its impact. More than US$100&nbsp;million in losses were incurred, when 13 oil platforms were destroyed, with an additional 5 more damaged beyond repair.<ref>U. S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service. [http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/studies/2004/2004-049.pdf History of the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry in Southern Louisiana Interim Report: Volume I: Papers on the Evolving Offshore Industry.] Retrieved on 2007-02-02.</ref>

===Gulf Coast===
[[Image:Hilda1964filledrainblk.gif|thumb|right|250px|Rainfall from Hilda in the United States]]
====Louisiana====
Almost a complete evacuation of the entire Louisiana coast accounted for the low death toll of 38, most of which were caused by [[tornado]]es spawned by the storm as it approached the coast. One twister at [[Larose, Louisiana]], killed 22 and injured 200 people. Three other tornadoes caused much damage in the [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] metropolitan area but no deaths. In the town of [[Erath, Louisiana]], 8 deaths were attributed to the collapse of the town's water tower onto their city hall, the eight men killed were volunteer civil defense workers. A tornado in Golden Meadow damaged several buildings and knocked down utility lines. The tornado damage, in combination with the crop damage from rainfall, caused a total of $126,000,000 in damage (1964&nbsp;dollars). The highest rainfall report measured during Hilda was five miles northwest of Jeanerette, where 17.71&nbsp;inches/449.8&nbsp;mm fell.<ref>David Roth. [http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/hilda1964.html Hurricane Hilda.] Retrieved on 2007-04-14.</ref> Damage totaled $3&nbsp;million.

====Georgia====
Rains were excessive in Georgia due to Hilda. The rains and resulting flooding caused extensive damage to roads, bridges, culverts, farmland and other property in several portions of the state. The heaviest damage from Hilda was in the northern mountainous towns where eight inches fell and following rains. Damage in Rabun County alone was $100,000 (1964&nbsp;USD).<ref name="HildaDamage1">{{

====Texas====
The only effects on Texas by Hilda were rough seas and high tides.<ref name="HildaDamage2"/> No deaths or injuries were reported and slight damage occurred. A few piers and secondary roads received slight damage. State Highway 87 near the [[Bolivar Peninsula]] in the Gilcrest and High Island area were covered with four foot tides.<ref name="HildaDamage2"/>

=== Mid-Atlantic United States ===
Heavy rains fell in the Carolinas ranging from 5-10&nbsp;inches in [[South Carolina]] and the adjacent [[North Carolina]]. The rains caused [[tributaries]] in Sanatee River System to start rapidly rising.<ref name="Rain1">{{
