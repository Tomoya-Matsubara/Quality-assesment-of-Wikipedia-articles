The video for "Deep, Deep Trouble" illustrates the things Bart raps about in the song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart to hurry up, Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler and as a result he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble.<ref name="dvd"/> Joanne Ostrow of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' thought the video was not "nearly as clever as the cartoon" and that it had "'promotional gimmick' written all over it."<ref name=Ostrow/> "Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?", she added.<ref name=Ostrow>{{cite news|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne|title=Savvy 'Simpsons' slips in a plug for latest music video|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date=1991-03-06|page=1F}}</ref>
