The '''EMC AB6''' was a type of [[diesel locomotive]] built exclusively for the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] (the "Rock Island Line") by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' [[Electro-Motive Diesel|Electro-Motive Corporation]] and delivered in June 1940. Two examples were built, numbered #750 and #751.  They were built for the ''[[Rocky Mountain Rocket]]'' [[passenger train]], which travelled as a unified train from [[Chicago, Illinois]], to [[Limon, Colorado]], but then divided; with one segment going to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], and the other to [[Denver, Colorado]]. The Rock Island desired a locomotive that could look like an integrated part of the train during the Chicago-Limon portion of the route, but could then be operated independently to take three cars to Colorado Springs.  A regular, cab-equipped A-unit could have been purchased, but that would have ruined the streamlined look of the train, so the RI had EMC build a flat-fronted locomotive based on an [[EMD E-unit|E-series]] [[EMC E6|E6]]B ([[B unit]]) but with an operating cab, headlight, [[pilot (locomotive)|pilot]], and other features to enable it to operate as an independent locomotive.

Since the small three- and four-car trains the units would have to haul independently were very light, the AB6 pair were built with only one 1,000&nbsp;hp EMC 567 [[V12 engine]], and a baggage compartment where the second engine would have been. Later, with increasing trainloads, the baggage compartment was replaced with a second engine.

In 1965, the units had their [[Steam generator (railroad)|steam generator]]s replaced with [[head-end power]] and were reassigned to [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] suburban service in the Chicago area. In this form, they lasted until the mid-1970s.
