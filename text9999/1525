'''Calbindin''' refers to several [[calcium in biology|calcium]]-binding proteins. They were originally described as [[vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein]]s in the intestine and kidney in the chick and mammals. They are now classified in different sub-families as they differ in the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding [[EF-hand]] sites.

==Calbindin-D28k==
'''Calbindin-D28k''' was first shown to be present in the intestine in birds and then found in the mammalian kidney. It is also expressed in a number of [[neuroendocrine]] cells, particularly in the [[cerebellum]]. It is encoded in humans by the ''CALB1'' gene.

Calbindin-D28k contains 4 active calcium-binding [[protein domain|domain]]s, and 2 modified domains that have lost their calcium-binding capacity. Calbindin-D28k acts as a calcium buffer and calcium sensor and can hold four Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the [[EF-hands]] of loops EF1, EF3, EF4 and EF5. The structure was solved using high-resolution NMR and which was one of the largest proteins then to be determined.<ref name="pmid16799559" />  The sequence of Calbindin is 263 residues in length and has only one chain.  The sequence consists mostly of alpha helicies but beta sheets are not absent.  According to the PDB it is 44% helical with 14 helices containing 117 residues, and 4% beta sheet with 9 strands containing 13 residues.

Calbindin-D28k is a [[vitamin D]] responsive gene in many tissues, in particular the chick intestine, where it has a clear function in mediating calcium absorption.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wasserman|first=RH|coauthors=Fullmer, CS|title=On the molecular mechanism of intestinal calcium transport.|journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology|year=1989|volume=249|pages=45<U+2013>65|pmid=2543194}}</ref>  In the brain, its synthesis is independent of vitamin-D.

There is no [[homology (biology)|homology]] between calbindin-D28k and calbindin-D9k, apart from their calcium binding domains ([[EF-hands]]): calbindin-D9k has two EF-hands, and calbindin-D28k has six.

==Calretinin==
{{Main|Calretinin}}
'''Calretinin''' is a 29kDa protein with 58% homology to calbindin-D28k and principally found in nervous tissues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=JH|title=Calretinin: a gene for a novel calcium-binding protein expressed principally in neurons.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=1987|volume=105|issue=3|pages=1343<U+2013>53|pmid=3654755|pmc=2114790|doi=10.1083/jcb.105.3.1343}}</ref>   It is encoded in humans by the ''CALB2'' gene.

==Calbindin-D9k==
{{See also|S100G}}
'''Calbindin-D9k''' is present in [[mammal]]ian intestinal [[epithelial cell]]s (enterocytes). Calbindin-D9k can also be found in the kidney and [[uterus]] in some mammalian species.  It in encoded in humans by the ''[[S100G]]'' gene which has also been termed ''CALB3''.

Calbindin-D9k is a member of the [[S-100 protein|S100]] family of [[calcium-binding proteins]]. It has two [[EF-hands]] sequences which bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> with high affinity.

Calbindin-D9k mediates the transport of calcium across the enterocytes from the apical side, where entry is regulated by the [[calcium channel]] [[TRPV6]], to the basolateral side, where [[calcium pump]]s such as [[Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase|PMCA]]1 utilize intracellular [[adenosine triphosphate]] to pump calcium into the blood.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wasserman|first=RH|coauthors=Chandler, JS, Meyer, SA, Smith, CA, Brindak, ME, Fullmer, CS, Penniston, JT, Kumar, R|title=Intestinal calcium transport and calcium extrusion processes at the basolateral membrane|journal=The Journal of nutrition|year=1992|volume=122|pages=662<U+2013>71|pmid=1311756|issue=3 Suppl}}</ref> The transport of calcium across the enterocyte cytoplasm appears to be rate-limiting for calcium absorption in the intestine; the presence of calbindin increases the amount of calcium crossing the cell without raising the free concentration.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feher|first=JJ|coauthors=Fullmer, CS, Wasserman, RH|title=Role of facilitated diffusion of calcium by calbindin in intestinal calcium absorption|journal=The American journal of physiology|year=1992|volume=262|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=C517<U+2013>26|pmid=1539638}}</ref>  Calbindin-D9k may also stimulate the basolateral calcium-pumping [[ATPase]]s.  [[gene expression|Expression]] of calbindin-D9k, like that of calbindin-D28k, is stimulated by the active vitamin D [[metabolite]], [[calcitriol]] although the precise mechanisms are still controversial.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barley|first=NF|coauthors=Prathalingam, SR, Zhi, P, Legon, S, Howard, A, Walters, JR|title=Factors involved in the duodenal expression of the human calbindin-D9k gene|journal=The Biochemical journal|year=1999|volume=341|pages=491<U+2013>500|pmid=10417310|doi=10.1042/0264-6021:3410491|pmc=1220384|issue=3}}</ref>  In mice in which the [[biochemical receptor|receptor]] for vitamin D is not [[gene expression|expressed]], calbindin-D9k is reduced, but not absent.
