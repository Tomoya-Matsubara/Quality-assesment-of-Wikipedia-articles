The '''Battle of Amiens''', which began on [[August 8|August 8th]] [[1918]], was the opening phase of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] offensive later known as the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] that ultimately led to the end of [[World War I]]. Allied forces advanced over seven [[mile]]s on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides' morale and the large amount of [[Surrender (military)|surrendering]] [[German Empire|German]] forces. This led [[Erich Ludendorff]] to famously describe the first day of the battle as "the black day of the German Army." Amiens was one of the first major battles involving [[armoured warfare]] and marked the end of [[trench warfare]] on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]], fighting becoming mobile once again until [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|the armistice]] was signed on [[November 11|November 11th]], [[1918]].

==Prelude==
On [[March 21]], [[1918]], the [[German Empire]] had launched [[Operation Michael]], the first in a series of attacks planned to drive the Allies back along the length of the Western Front. Michael was intended to defeat the right wing of the [[British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), but lack of success before [[Arras]] ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of [[Amiens]], a vital [[railway]] junction, but the advance had been halted at [[Villers-Bretonneux]] by the Australians on April 4.<ref name="atlas">''Historical Atlas of World War I''. Anthony Livesey, Henry Holt and Company: New York. 1994</ref> Subsequent German offensives &mdash; [[Operation Georgette]] (April 9th&ndash;11th), [[Operation Bl<U+00FC>cher-Yorck]] (May 27), [[Operation Gneisenau]] (June 9) and [[Operation Marne-Rheims]] (July 15th&mdash;17th) &mdash; had made advances but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough.<ref>''The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917-1918''. Rod Paschall, Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill: Chapel Hill, North Carolina. 1989</ref><ref>''Kaiserschlat 1918 <U+2013> The Final German Offensive''. Randal Gray, Grolier Educational: Danbury, Connecticut. 1997</ref>

At the end of the Marne-Rheims offensive Allied commander [[Ferdinand Foch]] ordered a counter-offensive which led to the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the [[Marne River|Marne]] to the north. Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto offense and he agreed on a proposal by the commander of the BEF, Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]], to strike on the [[Somme River|Somme]], east of Amiens and southwest of the 1916 battlefield of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]].

===Plan===
Foch had defeated a large amount of German forces at the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] and believed he could begin an offensive in the north of France. Foch disclosed his plan on [[July 23]], [[1918]]<ref name=kearsey2>''Kearsey'' pgs. 11-12</ref> following the German retreat that had begun July 20th.<ref name="duffy">{{cite web | last =Duffy | first = Michael | title = Second Battle of the Marne | publisher=FirstWorldWar.Com | date = [[2004-04-17]] | url= http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/marne2.htm | accessdate = 2006-07-26}}</ref> The plan called for reducing the [[Saint-Mihiel]] [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] (which would later see combat in the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]]) and liberating the [[railroad]] lines that ran through Amiens. Foch planned the operations to start on August 8th with a combination of British, French, Australian, and Canadian divisions along with a single American division and around 580 tanks (150 in reserves as supply and repair vehicles). 1,386 [[Artillery|guns]] and [[howitzer]]s, making up 27 medium artillery brigades and 13 heavy batteries, were responsible for artillery cover. A key factor in Foch's plan was secrecy, there was to be no pre-battle bombardment, only the artillery fire immediately prior to the advance of Australian, Canadian, and British forces.<ref name=kearsey2/> Although the French had 72 [[Whippet_Mk_A|Whippets]] to follow up their advance they had no heavy tanks with which to lead the main assault and so had a 45 minute preliminary barrage starting at zero hour.

Although the Germans were still on the offensive in late July 1918 the Allies were strengthening their positions. German commanders realized in early August that their forces might be forced to defend, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. Germans believed Foch would likely attack the aforementioned Saint-Mihiel front, either east of [[Reims]] or near [[Mount Kemmel]]; while they believed British would attack along either the [[Lys river|Lys]] or [[Somme River]]s. German forces began to withdraw from the Lys and other fronts in response to these theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, only moving troops at night, and making fake movements during the day to mask their actual intent. The [[German 27th Division]] actually attacked the Amiens front planned for the August 8th Allied offensive on August 6th, penetrating roughly 800 [[yard]]s into the one-and-a-half mile front. The division moved somewhat back to its original location on the morning of the 7th, but the movement still required changes to the Allied plan. The Allies did various things to maintain the secrecy of the attack including not bringing the [[Canadian Corps]] into position from the north until August 7th, pasting the notice "Keep Your Mouth Shut" into orders issued to the men, and never using the actual word "offensive".<ref name="kearsey3">''Kearsey'' pgs. 13-14</ref>

[[Image:Amiensmap001.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Map of how the battle unfolded over August 1918]]
The battle began in dense [[fog]] at [[4:20]] AM on [[August 8|August 8th]], [[1918]].<ref name="kearsey3"/><ref name="british1">[http://www.1914-1918.net/bat26.htm The British Army in the Great War: Battle of Amiens]</ref> British forces under Rawlinson were the farthest north in the battle, with Canadian and Australian forces at the center of the field, and the French forces under Debeny in the south.<ref name="atlas"/> Although German forces were alert on August 8th this was largely to stop potential retaliation for their August 6th incursion<ref name="kearsey5">''Kearsey'' pgs. 17-18</ref> and not because they had learned of the pre-planned Allied attack. Although the two forces were within 500 yards of one another [[Chemical warfare|gas bombardment]] was very low as a bulk of the Allied presence was unknown to the Germans. The attack was so unexpected that German forces only began to return fire on Allied positions after five minutes, and even then at the positions forces had assembled at for the start of the battle and had long since abandoned.<ref name="kearsey4">''Kearsey'' pgs. 15-16</ref>

In the first phase seven divisions attacked, the British [[British 18th (Eastern) Division|18th (Eastern)]] and [[British 58th (2/1st London) Division|58th (2/1st London)]] divisions, the Australian [[Australian 2nd Division (World War I)|2nd]] and [[Australian 3rd Division (World War I)|3rd]] divisions, and the [[1st Canadian Division|1st]], [[2nd Canadian Division|2nd]] and [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd]] Canadian divisions. These troops were to capture the first German position, advancing about 4000 [[yard]]s, an objective they had reached by about 7:30 AM.<ref name="british1"/>

In the centre, the leading divisions had been followed up by supporting units who would move through to attack the second objective a further two miles distant. Australian units had reached their first objectives by 7:10 AM, and by 8:20 AM the Australian [[Australian 4th Division (World War I)|4th]] and [[Australian 5th Division (World War I)|5th]] and the Canadian [[4th Canadian Division|4th]] divisions moved off, passing through the initial hole torn in the German line.<ref name="british1"/> The third phase of the attack was to have been performed by infantry-carrying [[Mark V (tank)#Mark V*|Mark V*]] tanks however the infantry were able to carry out this final step unaided.<ref name="british1"/> The Allies had penetrated well to the rear of the German defences and cavalry now continued the advance, one [[brigade]] in the Australian sector and two cavalry divisions in the Canadian sector. Allied forces harassed German positions throughout the advance, [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[armored car]] fire kept retreating Germans from rallying.<ref name="british1"/> 

Canadian and Australian forces in the center, aided heavily by tanks, had quickly advanced, pushing the line 3 miles forward from its starting point by 11 AM. The speed of their advance aided in their activities, capturing a party of officers, and some divisional staff, eating breakfast.<ref name="kearsey4"/> A gap 15 miles long was punched in the German line south of the Somme by the end of the day's advance. The British Fourth Army had taken 13,000 prisoners while the French had taken a further 3,000. Total German losses were estimated to be 30,000 on 8 August. <ref>''Chronicles of World War One, Volume II: 1917-1921''. Randal Gray, Facts on File: New York. 1991.</ref> The Fourth Army's casualties, British, Australian and Canadian infantry were approximately 8800, exclusive of tank and air losses and their French Allies.

 

German Army [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] noted the Allies use of surprise and that Allied destruction of German lines of communication had hampered potential German counter-attacks by isolating command positions.<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/amiens_hindenburg.htm Hidenburg on Amiens] by Paul von Hindenburg from ''Source Records of the Great War, Vol. VI'', ed. Charles F. Horne, National Alumni 1923.</ref> The German general [[Erich Ludendorff]] described the first day of Amiens as "the black day of the German Army", not because of the ground lost to the advancing Allies but because the [[morale]] of the German troops had sunk to the point where large numbers of troops began to [[Surrender (military)|capitulate]].<ref name="atlas"/> Allied forces had pushed, on average, seven miles into enemy territory by the end of the day.<ref name=kearsey2/> The Canadians gained 8 miles, Australians 7, British 2 and the French 5 miles.

===Later fighting===
The advance would continue, but without the spectacular results of August 8th. This is possibly because the rapid gains of the infantry had outrun the supporting artillery<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiens.htm Australians in France - The Battle of Amiens]</ref> and the initial force of more than 500 tanks that played a large role in the initial Allied success<ref name="kearsey4"> was reduced to 6 tanks fit for battle within 4 days.<ref>[http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/greatwar/g3/cs1/background.htm Tanks] from the National Archives of the United Kingdom. Retrieved July 15, 2006.</ref> On August 10th there were signs that the Germans were pulling out of the [[salient (military)|salient]] from Operation Michael. According to official reports the Allies had captured nearly 50,000 prisoners and 500 guns by August 27th.<ref name="gibbs">[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/amiens_gibbs.htm Battle of Amiens, 27 August 1918] by Philip Gibbs from ''Source Records of the Great War, Vol. VI'', ed. Charles F. Horne, National Alumni 1923.</ref> Even with the lessened armor the British had driven 12 miles into German positions by August 13th.<ref name=kearsey2/>

==Aftermath of the Battle==

The Battle of Amiens was a major turning point in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the offensive before the war devolved into trench warfare with the [[Schlieffen Plan]], the [[Race to the Sea]] slowed movement on the Western Front, and the German [[Spring Offensive]] earlier that year had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armored support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions. The British Third army with no armored support had almost no effect on the line while the Fourth with less than a thousand tanks broke deep into German territory, for example.<ref name="atlas"/> Australian commander [[John Monash]] was [[Knight|knighted]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in the days following the battle.

British [[war correspondent]] [[Philip Gibbs]] noted Amiens' effect on the war's tempo, saying on August 27th that "the enemy...is on the defensive" and "the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands that we are able to strike him at many different places." Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop [[morale]], saying "the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory.  On our side the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly" and that "there is a change also in the enemy's mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front.  All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation."<ref name="gibbs"/>
