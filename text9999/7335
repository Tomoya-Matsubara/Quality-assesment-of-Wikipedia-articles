The '''Sutton Wick air disaster''' occurred on 5 March 1957, when a [[Blackburn Beverley|Blackburn Beverley C.Mk 1]] heavy transport aircraft, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''XH117'', of [[No. 53 Squadron RAF|53 Squadron]] [[Royal Air Force]], crashed in the village of [[Sutton Wick, Oxfordshire|Sutton Wick]], [[Berkshire]],<ref>Now part of Oxfordshire</ref> England, near [[RAF Abingdon]] following the failure of two of its four engines.<ref name="ASN" /> After take-off, the [[Engine number|No.]] 1 engine failed, and shortly before impact, whilst on [[Final approach (aviation)|final approach]] back to Abingdon, No. 2 engine failed to respond to throttle inputs. The aeroplane was unable to reach RAF Abingdon and struck cables and trees 18&nbsp;minutes after lifting off.

Of the 17 passengers and 5 crew on board, all but 4 died in the accident. A subsequent investigation found that a valve in the fuel system had been installed backwards, causing the engines to be [[fuel starvation|starved of fuel]].<ref name="ASN" /> Those found responsible for fitting the valve were charged under the [[Air Force Act]].<ref name="Hansard" /> Two men who participated in the rescue efforts following the crash were highly praised for "refusing to give up while there was hope of finding survivors among the wreckage."<ref name="Harrison" /> Following the accident, the design of the valve that had been installed incorrectly was changed so they could not physically be installed backwards.

==Flight history==
In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], the [[Secretary of State for Air]], [[George Ward, 1st Viscount Ward of Witley|George Ward]], stated that the crash took place on 5 March 1957. The Beverley departed RAF Abingdon,<ref name="XH"> Halley 2001 p. 39</ref> a base that had been used as a training station for [[RAF Bomber Command]] throughout the Second World War, bound for [[RAF Akrotiri]] in [[Cyprus]]. On the day of the crash, the aeroplane was carrying freight, a relief crew and eight RAF policemen with their [[Police dog|dogs]]. Eighteen minutes into the flight, as the aircraft was ascending, the No. 1 engine on the aeroplane's [[port (nautical)|port]] wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by [[Propeller_(aircraft)#Feathering|feathering]] the engine, a process that involves rotating the propeller blades parallel to the [[Aerodynamics|airflow]] in order to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on the airframe and increase [[Fuel efficiency|efficiency]].<ref name="Hansard" /> The flight crew declared an [[Mayday (distress signal)|emergency]] and requested a [[Instrument approach|blind approach]] back to RAF Abingdon, upon which the [[Air traffic controller|controller]] in contact with the aeroplane alerted emergency services on the ground.<ref name="Hansard" /> A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from the No. 2 [[fuel tank]]&mdash;which was powering engine No.1&mdash;the second of four such tanks in the port wing of the aeroplane.<ref name="Hansard" /> In an effort to stop the leak, the crew deactivated the [[Petcock|fuel cocks]] and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank on the port side.<ref name="Hansard" /> 

As the Beverley turned on to the final approach for RAF Abingdon, the crew applied power to the remaining three [[Bristol Centaurus]] engines, but No. 2 engine<U+2014>also on the port wing<U+2014>failed to respond, and the aeroplane began to lose speed and height. Knowing he could not make the airfield the captain tried to land the aircraft in an open field. However, the aircraft became uncontrollable and struck a number of high tension cables<ref name="Hansard" />, some trees, which ripped the port side wing from the fuselage, and impacted with the ground.<ref name="Hansard" /> The aircraft destroyed a caravan and a pre-fabricated house before somersaulting and landing upside down.<ref name="Times53782" /> The aircraft crashed at 11:00&nbsp;am,<ref name="ASN" /> 18&nbsp;minutes after take-off,<ref name="Hansard" /> near the village of Sutton Wick, {{convert|2|mi}} south of Abingdon.<ref name="XH" /> Upon impact, the aircraft, which was carrying a large amount of fuel for the flight to Cyprus, instantly caught fire.<ref name="Harrison" /> Although 2&nbsp;civilians on the ground who were in the pre-fabricated building,<ref name="Times53782" /> 3&nbsp;crew, 15&nbsp;passengers,<ref name="ASN">{{ASN accident|id=19570305-0}}</ref> and a number of RAF Police dogs<ref name="Harrison" /> were killed in the initial impact and the post-crash fire, 4&nbsp;survived: 2&nbsp;crew and 2&nbsp;passengers.<ref name="ASN" />

==Investigation==
[[Image:Bristol.centaurus.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|210px|A preserved [[Bristol Centaurus]] engine, similar to those installed on the Beverley involved in the crash. Production of the Centaurus, one of the largest piston aircraft engines built, began in 1942.]]
A Board of Inquiry investigated the crash and found that the accident was caused by the loss of power from the No. 1 and No. 2 engines,<ref name="Hansard" /> both mounted on the port wing of the aircraft. George Ward told the House Of Commons that "the four fuel tanks on the port side of the Beverley feed into a collector box from which the two port engines are fed. From the available evidence, including inspections of part of the aircraft's fuel system, it is clear that a non-return valve between No. 1 (port) tank and the collector box had been fitted in reverse and that the fuel supply from Nos. 3 and 4 (port) tanks were switched off throughout the flight." Ward continued, saying that the loss of power from No. 1 was caused by it being feathered as a precautionary measure and the fuel starvation to No. 2 engine was caused by an incorrectly fitted non-return valve in the supply line from No. 1 fuel tank.<ref name="Hansard" />  No. 2 fuel tank had been isolated and two smaller fuel tanks in the port wing had not been selected during the flight.<ref name="Hansard" />

The tradesman who had fitted the valve, and his supervisor, were prosecuted and charged,<ref name="Hansard" /> but a court found that they were not guilty of the main charge.<ref name="People52">Perry 2004 p. 52</ref> The Board also noted that some fuel was available from the two smaller tanks, which were not used during the flight, and that the captain "must bear some responsibility" for not using those tanks.<ref name="Hansard" /> Ward said however that "owing to the nature of the flight the amount of fuel in the two smaller tanks was not large, and it can only be assumed that the captain had no reason to believe that both port engines would not operate satisfactorily off the two main port tanks individually."<ref name="Hansard" /> The captain lost his life in the accident, and no charges were brought against him or any of the flight crew.

==Aftermath==
As a consequence of the disaster at Sutton Wick, the design of the incorrectly installed fuel valve was changed, so such an error would be impossible.<ref name="People53" /> Aviation author Graham Perry wrote that, following the crash, "airworthiness design standards were changed so that the threads at either end of all such valved manufactured since are now made totally different from each other. Items like a non-return valve simply cannot now be assembled in the wrong sense."<ref name="People53" /> Nevertheless, Perry wrote, "[one] would be amazed how many people have still tried to do so in the forty-seven years since, most realising their mistake after looking in the manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who had gone before them and made it impossible."<ref name="People53">Perry 2004 p. 53</ref>

Reverend Stanley Harrison, the station padre at RAF Abingdon, was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)]] and Flying Officer Charles Evans, the medical officer, a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)]] for efforts in the rescue of the crew.<ref name="Harrison">{{cite web | title=''Ministrare Non Minstrai'' Padre Stanley William Harrison| url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/stclementdanes/rafcms/mediafiles/ABB38EEA_1143_EC82_2E049C58A50E5BCB.pdf | work= | publisher=Ministry of Defence | date= | accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=41120 |date=9 July 1957 |startpage=4085 |supp=x |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref> They were involved in the three-hour rescue effort, removing fourteen bodies from the wreckage, and, after half an hour they found an RAF Police dog alive.<ref name="Harrison" /> The RAF praised the two men for displaying "courage and resourcefulness of a high order, refusing to give up while there was hope of finding survivors among the wreckage."<ref name="Harrison" /> Also singled out for attention by the Board of Inquiry was a Mrs Smith of Abingdon, and the efforts of the [[Berkshire Constabulary]] were praised by investigators.<ref name="Hansard">{{cite web | title=Beverley Aircraft Accident, Abingdon (Report)| url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1957/apr/10/beverley-aircraft-accident-abingdon | work= | publisher=United Kingdom Parliament | date= 10 April 1957| accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>
