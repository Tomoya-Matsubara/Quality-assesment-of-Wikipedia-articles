'''''Anodyne''''' is the fourth and final [[studio album]] by [[alternative country]] band [[Uncle Tupelo]], released on October 5, 1993. The recording of the album was preceded by the departure of the original [[drummer]] [[Mike Heidorn]] and the addition of three new band members: [[bassist]] [[John Stirratt]], drummer [[Ken Coomer]], and [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Max Johnston]]. The band signed with [[Sire Records]] shortly before recording the album; ''Anodyne'' was Uncle Tupelo's only major label release until ''[[89/93: An Anthology]]'' in 2002.

Recorded in [[Austin, Texas]], ''Anodyne'' featured a split in songwriting credits between singers [[Jay Farrar]] and [[Jeff Tweedy]], plus a [[cover version]] of the [[Doug Sahm]] song "Give Back the Key to My Heart", with Sahm on vocals.<ref name="liner"/> The lyrical themes were influenced by [[country music]] and<U+2014>more than their preceding releases<U+2014>touched on interpersonal relationships. After two promotional tours for the album, tensions between Farrar and Tweedy culminated in the breakup of Uncle Tupelo. Well-received upon its initial release, ''Anodyne'' was re-mastered and re-released in 2003 by [[Rhino Entertainment]] including five bonus tracks.

==Context==
[[Uncle Tupelo]]'s third album, ''[[March 16<U+2013>20, 1992]]'', was released though [[Rockville Records]] on August 3, 1992. On the release, the band eschewed the growing popularity of [[alternative rock]] by playing acoustic [[folk music|folk]] and [[country music|country]] songs "as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene".<ref>Kot 2004. p. 66</ref> Drummer [[Mike Heidorn]] had a reduced role on the album; because it was an acoustic album, Heidorn added only brush-stroke percussion on a few songs. Heidorn wanted to leave the band to spend more time with his family<U+2014>his girlfriend was the mother of two children. After band manager Tony Margherita announced that several major labels were interested in signing Uncle Tupelo, Heidorn decided to permanently leave the band.<ref>Kot 2004. pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref>

Rockville Records refused to pay Uncle Tupelo any royalties, even though the band's first two albums, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'' and ''[[Still Feel Gone]]'', sold a combined 40,000 copies. Consequently, Margherita was trying to find a new recording deal for the band.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 70</ref> On a recommendation by singer [[Gary Louris]] of [[The Jayhawks]], talent scout Joe McEwen pursued the band for a contract with [[Sire Records]]. McEwen was impressed by how the band was willing to go against trends, calling the band "an alternative to the alternative".<ref>Kot 2004. p. 71</ref> Executing an out-clause in their contract with Rockville, Uncle Tupelo signed a seven-record deal with Sire in 1992. The deal guaranteed the release of at least two albums, with a $150,000 budget for the first.<ref>Kot 2004. pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref>

Before releasing their first album with Sire, Uncle Tupelo needed a drummer. The two remaining members of the band interviewed twenty-four candidates. Farrar and Tweedy were both impressed with [[Ken Coomer]], the former drummer of [[Clockhammer]], but decided to give the position to [[Bill Belzer]]. Belzer toured with Uncle Tupelo as the opening act for [[Sugar (band)|Sugar]] during the European segment of the promotional tour for ''March 16<U+2013>20, 1992'', but was dismissed for the band after six months in favor of Coomer.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 73<U+2013>74</ref> Coomer was not the only new member added after the tour<U+2014>Uncle Tupelo sought to expand beyond a trio for the ''Anodyne'' recording sessions. They recruited [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Max Johnston]] and [[bassist]] [[John Stirratt]]<U+2014>Stirratt's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full-time guitarist on the songs that he wrote.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 75</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hampel|first=Paul|date=August 5, 1993|title=Uncle Tupelo: Filling Out into a Quintet|publisher=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''}}</ref>

==Recording==
''Anodyne'' was recorded from May to June 1993 at Cedar Creek studio in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]. Uncle Tupelo liked the studio because it "just seemed really kind of homey and small and cheap".<ref name="OS">{{cite news|last=Gettelman|first=Parry|title=Uncle Tupelo Mines Rock's Country Vein|publisher=''[[The Orlando Sentinel]]''|date=February 4, 1994}}</ref> The album was [[Record producer|produced]], [[audio mixing|mixed]], and [[audio engineering|engineered]] by [[Brian Paulson]]. The now-expanded lineup inspired Tweedy to spend more time with his bandmates. After Tweedy wrote each song, he would play it to Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston to get their opinions. Farrar interpreted these practice sessions as a sign of Tweedy's increasing arrogance. At live shows, during this time, tensions between Tweedy and Farrar increased and led to verbal altercations.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 77</ref>

The album was recorded live in the studio, and each song was recorded in only one take. As a result, the recording sessions for ''Anodyne'' were completed in two weeks.<ref name="Req">{{citation|last=Durcholz|first=Daniel|title=Are You Ready for the Country?|magazine=Request Magazine|date=November 1993}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Fine|first=Jason|title=Heart of the Country|magazine=Option Magazine|date=November 1993}}</ref> ''Anodyne'' was the only Uncle Tupelo album to completely lack overdubbing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Masley|first=Ed|title=Mix of Punk and Country? Say Uncle|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|date=February 27, 1994}}</ref> Sire was pleased with the album; according to McEwen, "everybody [at the label] considered it a step up from what they'd done before."<ref name="Kot2">Kot 2004. p. 79</ref> Farrar wrote six of the songs on the album and Tweedy wrote five. While on tour, Uncle Tupelo met [[Texas Tornados]] singer [[Doug Sahm]] at the Hotel Phoenix in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Farrar invited him to join the band in the studio for a [[cover version|cover]] of Sahm's "Give Back the Key to My Heart".<ref name="liner">''Anodyne'' album notes (re-issued version), 2003.

The Band from Belleville, Ill., has a Loose, Spontaneous Sound|publisher=''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]''|date=February 4, 1994}}</ref>

The lyrical content of ''Anodyne'' was influenced by 1950s and 1960s [[country music]], particularly [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Buck Owens]], and [[Lefty Frizzell]]. Tweedy included several songs referencing aspects of the [[music industry]]. One example was "Acuff-Rose", a [[paean]] on the music publishers of [[Acuff-Rose Music]]. He also wrote "We've Been Had", which was intended to chastise bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[The Clash]] who were "all just show biz". Tweedy was also the author of "New Madrid", a song about [[Iben Browning]]'s erroneous prediction of an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[earthquake]] in [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], [[Missouri]]. Farrar was less comfortable discussing the lyrics that he wrote, claiming that his songs frequently change their meanings.<ref name="Req"/> Like other Uncle Tupelo albums, Farrar and Tweedy wrote their own lyrics, and played them for each other a week before the recording sessions.<ref name="OS"/> In comparison to the rest of the Uncle Tupelo catalog, Coomer described the music of the album as "some of [the band's] earlier crunch with the acoustic subtlety of ''March 16<U+2013>20, 1992''".<ref>{{cite news|last=Morrison|first=Mark|title=A Musical Mix Uncle Tupelo is a Little Bit Country, A Little Bit Rock 'N' Roll|publisher=''[[Roanoke Times]]''|date=February 18, 1994}}</ref>

==Promotion and reception==
''Anodyne'' was Uncle Tupelo's only recording to appear on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart.<ref>{{citation|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 10, 1993}}</ref> Despite the lack of a [[single (music)|single]] to promote the album, sales eventually surpassed 150,000 copies.<ref name="Kot3">Kot 2004. p. 80</ref> A promotional tour for the album began later that year, including a sold-out show at Tramps in [[New York City]]. Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets.<ref name="Kot2"/> The success of the tour encouraged the label; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley, "people here thought we were going to have platinum records from Uncle Tupelo."<ref name="Kot3"/>

Despite the label's aspirations, Jay Farrar announced his intention to leave Uncle Tupelo in January 1994.<ref name="Kot3"/> Farrar kept his reasoning secret until fall 1995, when he claimed in an interview that "it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible."<ref>{{citation|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html|title=Jay Farrar Traces a Path Away from Uncle Tupelo|magazine=[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]|date=Fall 1995|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> As a sign of loyalty to band manager Tony Margherita, who had acquired a three thousand [[U.S. dollar|dollar]] debt on behalf of the band, Farrar agreed to do another promotional tour.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 82</ref> Physical altercations between Tweedy and Farrar began two weeks into the tour and continued throughout<U+2014>many were due to Farrar's refusal to play on Tweedy's songs.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 83</ref> Despite Farrar's reservations, Uncle Tupelo performed Tweedy's "The Long Cut" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brian]]'', the band's only network television appearance.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 84</ref> The band played their final concert on May 1, 1994 at [[Mississippi Nights]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>Kot 2004. p. 85</ref> The remaining members of the ''Anodyne'' sessions formed [[Wilco]] a few weeks later.<ref>{{citation|last=Sheridan|first=Phil|title=Roger, Wilco|magazine=[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]|date=February 1995}}</ref>

The band re-mastered and re-released the album on March 11, 2003 through [[Rhino Records]]. The new version included two previously unreleased songs: Farrar's "Stay True", Tweedy's "Wherever". It also included a cover of [[Waylon Jennings]]' "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way?", with vocals by [[Joe Ely]], a song previously released on the 1993 compilation ''Trademark of Quality''. Live cover versions of "Truck Drivin' Man" and "[[Susie Q (song)|Suzy Q]]" were also included on the re-issue.<ref name="liner"/>

''Anodyne'' was well-received by critics domestically and internationally. [[Allmusic]] writer Jason Ankeny wrote, "Uncle Tupelo never struck a finer balance between rock and country than on ''Anodyne''".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:pve097rjkrst~T1|title=Anodyne (review)|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> [[Mark Kemp]] wrote for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the band "[has] an intuitive sense of the simplicity and dynamics of a country song."<ref>{{citation|last=Kemp|first=Mark|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/uncletupelo/albums/album/236800/review/6067452/anodyne|title=Anodyne (review)|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=December 9, 1993|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> German music periodical ''[[Spex (magazine)|Spex]]'' compared the album to [[Neil Young]] and to [[Little Feat]]'s [[Little Feat (album)|debut album]]."<ref>{{citation|last=Diederichsen|first=Detlef|title=Anodyne (review)|magazine=[[Spex (magazine)|Spex]]|date=October 1993}}</ref> At the end of the year, ''Anodyne'' placed at number twenty-eight on [[The Village Voice|''The Village Voice'']]'s [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll and at number nineteen on the ''Spex'' critics' poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres93.php|title=Pazz & Jop 1993|magazine= ''[[The Village Voice]]''|accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=1993 Jahresabrechnung|url=http://home.rhein-zeitung.de/~tommi.s/spex92.htm#1993|magazine=Spex|date=January 1994|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> Nathan Brackett praised Max Johnston's contributions in the 2004 book ''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'' and called the album "Tupelo's finest effort."<ref>Brackett 2004, p. 837</ref> Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' listed ''Anodyne'' in 1999 as one of "The Best Albums of the Century".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A895.htm|title=Uncle Tupelo: Anodyne|publisher=acclaimedmusic.net|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>

Although the majority of the album's reviews were positive, some critics disagreed. [[Q Magazine|''Q Magazine'']]'s reviewer noted that the band needed to "shed some of the Neil Young obsession."<ref>{{citation|title=Anodyne (review)|magazine=[[Q Magazine]]|date=November 1993}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'''s critic Tom Moon commented that the bonus tracks on the 2003 re-release were "pleasant but inconsequential."<ref>{{citation|last=Moon|first=Tom|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/236800/review/6067942/anodyne||title=Anodyne (review)|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=April 8, 2003|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] perceived the album as neither a "dud" nor worthy of "honorable mention".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=3986&name=Uncle+Tupelo|title=Robert Christgau: CG: Uncle Tupelo|publisher=[[Robert Christgau]]|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>
