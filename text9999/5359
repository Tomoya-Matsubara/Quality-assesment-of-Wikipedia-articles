'''''Enter the Grave''''' is the debut album by the English [[thrash metal]] band [[Evile]]. Released on August 27, 2007 in Europe and on September 25 in North America and Japan, the album received generally favorable critical reviews and  entered the [[UK Rock Chart]] at number 33. It was produced by [[Flemming Rasmussen]] and recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark. Rasmussen had earlier produced three [[Metallica]] albums, and some journalists commented on his role.

The track "Thrasher" was part of the ''Earache Thrash Pack'', downloadable content made available on March 18, 2008 for the music video console game ''[[Rock Band]]''. The album's lyrics were inspired by films, as well as topics such as a serial killer, [[Elizabeth B<U+00E1>thory|Countess Bathory]] and [[Witch-hunt|witch burnings]]. ''Enter the Grave'' was re-released as a limited-edition "redux" version on October 13, 2008 in Europe and on October 28 in North America.

==Recording==
On October 18, 2006, [[Earache Records]] announced that it had signed a record contract with Evile.<ref name="EvileSigning">{{cite web|title =Evile Signs With Earache Records| author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=18 October 2006|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=60479|accessdate=03 April 2010}}</ref> Looking for a producer for their debut album, the band decided to send a request by email to producer [[Flemming Rasmussen]] "for a laugh"; Rasmussen was well known and had produced three Metallica albums; 1984's ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'',<ref name="McIver127">McIver, Joel (2004), p. 127.</ref> 1986's ''[[Master of Puppets]]'',<ref name="McIver140">McIver, Joel (2004), p. 140.</ref> and 1988's ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]''.<ref name="McIver186">McIver, Joel (2004), p. 186.</ref> Lead vocalist / rhythm guitarist Matt Drake googled Rasmussen's name, and the first result returned was the producer's official website.

Drake emailed a number of mp3, but Rasmussen did not reply, leading Drake to worry that the producer "hated them, and thought they were shit." Earache Records subsequently emailed Rasmussen to formally ask if he would produce Evile's debut album, to which Rasmussen replied, "Yes".<ref name="EvileLucemFero"/> On March 12, 2007, his involvement was made public.<ref name="ETGRasmussenAnnouncement">{{cite web|title =Evile: Debut Album To Be Produced By Flemming Rasmussen  | author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=12 March 2007|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68615|accessdate=05 April 2010}}</ref>

Pre-production with Rasmussen began on April 28-29 at Evile's [[Huddersfield]], [[West Yorkshire]] rehearsal space. Soon after the band performed a live set at Tottenham Court Road, London's [[Fopp (retailer)|Fopp]] store, which Rasmussen attended to observe Evile's live sound, and "further gain a feel" for the group's music.<ref name="ETGPreProd">{{cite web|title =Evile Begins Pre-Production Process For Debut Album 'Enter The Grave'| author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=02 May 2007|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=71655|accessdate=03 April 2010}}</ref> The album was recorded and mixed at Sweet Silence Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark. ''Enter the Grave'' was produced, engineered, mixed and mastered by Rasmussen, who also supplied additional backing vocals to title track "Enter the Grave". Anders H.

In turn, Evile's guitarists went into a room where another person sat with a microphone, ready to capture the sound. From the control room, Rasmussen would say "Right, play something". The respective guitarist would play his instrument, to which Rasmussen would respond "Right, move it left".<ref name="EvileLucemFero"/> Moving the guitar left, the respective guitarist would play again, Rasmussen replying with "Move it right. Alright, leave it there. Don't touch it". The respective guitarist would leave his instrument in that position, and the "record" button would be pressed. From there, the musician in question would play his parts.<ref name="EvileLucemFero"/> A [[Mesa_Boogie#Rectifier_Series|Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier]] amplifier was tested alongside a [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]]  amplifier, but according to Drake, "the Mesa (sound) was nowhere near as good". Evile chose to record ''Enter the Grave'''s guitar parts using a Marshall amplifier, and spent "roughly ten minutes" attempting to achieve "a decent sound". "A bit longer" was spent testing the drums so that a "nice" sound could be achieved, and so that the drums could be tuned.<ref name="EvileLucemFero"/>

By June 5, recording for ''Enter the Grave'' had been completed, and Rasmussen had begun mixing the album.<ref name="ETGMixing"/> Video footage shot during recording sessions was uploaded to Earache Records' official YouTube account on July 4, providing an exclusive glimpse behind the scenes.<ref name="ETGVideoFootage">{{cite web|title =Evile: Video Footage From Recording Studio Posted Online  | author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=4 July 2007|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=76082|accessdate=05 April 2010}}</ref> In reviewing ''Enter the Grave'', some journalists commented on Rasmussen's role as producer. Chris Kee of ''[[Zero Tolerance Magazine]]'' said that "getting Flemming Rasmussen to produce [Enter the Grave] is a major coup and as you'd expect he's done a sterling job, these fine songs all being blessed with a clean, crisp, uncluttered sound",<ref name ="ETGZTReview">Kee, Chris. ''Enter the Grave'' review. ''Zero Tolerance''. October 2007.</ref> whereas Ian Webster of ''[[Terrorizer Magazine|Terrorizer]]'' felt that "booking a band into Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record their debut with legendary Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen is one hell of a statement of intent from Earache."<ref name="ETGTerrorizerReview">Webster, Ian. ''Enter the Grave'' review. ''Terrorizer''. October 2007.</ref> Eduardo Rivadavia of ''[[Allmusic]]'' also commented on Rasmussen's involvement, declaring that his production "is surely one large reason why the album is characterized by a distinctively crunchy, rhythmically airtight attack."<ref name="ETGAllmusic"/>

==Lyrical themes==
''Enter the Grave''s liner notes credit Evile as a whole for having written the album's lyrics.<ref name="AlbumNotes"/> In discussing his lyrical contributions during an October 2007 interview, lead vocalist / rhythm guitarist Matt Drake said that he was "really inspired by films"; "First Blood"'s lyrics were inspired by the [[First Blood|1982 film]] of the same name, whereas "We Who Are About to Die"'s lyrics were inspired by the 2000 epic ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.<ref name="EvileLucemFero"/> Inspired by an urban legend about [[Elizabeth B<U+00E1>thory|Countess Bathory]], the lyrics for "Bathe In Blood" were written by Drake while Evile were recording at Sweet Silence Studios - after penning the track's lyrics, he thought he "had gone too far".<ref name="EvileLucemFero"/> "Burned Alive", meanwhile, was about burning witches; reading about witches and "how they were dealt with in olden times", Drake "thought it might be interesting to add a devilish slant to it".<ref name="EvileMetalRevolution">{{cite web|title =Interview with Matt Drake| author =Kasper| publisher= Metal Revolution|date=29 August 2007|url=http://www.metal-revolution.com/plugins/content/content.php?content.870|accessdate=06 April 2010}}</ref> Inspired by what he read, Drake wrote about burned witches going to Hell, returning, and then killing everyone.<ref name="EvileLucemFero"/> Drake also wrote the lyrics to title track "Enter the Grave", and "Schizophrenia",<ref name="EvileMetalTemple">{{cite web|title =Interview with Matt Drake from Evile| author =Chronis, Grigoris| publisher= Metal Temple|date=08 October 2007|url=http://www.metal-revolution.com/plugins/content/content.php?content.870|accessdate=06 April 2010}}</ref> the former being about a serial killer.<ref name="EvileMetalRevolution"/>

Written by bassist Mike Alexander, the lyrics to "Armoured Assault" describe a giant tank war machine.<ref name="AlbumNotes"/> Alexander wrote "Killer From the Deep"'s lyrics as well, which Drake thinks might've been inspired by 1975 thriller ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.<ref name="EvileMetalRevolution"/> Drummer Ben Carter contributed lyrics for ''Enter the Grave'', writing the lyrics to "Man Against Machine".<ref name="EvileMetalTemple"/>

Eduardo Rivadavia of ''[[Allmusic]]'' felt that the album's lyrics were characterized by "splatter-demonic lyrics, reminiscent of [[Bay Area thrash metal|Bay Area]] staples like [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] -- even early [[Slayer]] for brief, exceptionally inspired moments."<ref name="ETGAllmusic"/> ''[[Metal Maniacs]]''' Kevin Stewart-Panko commented that ''Enter the Grave'' contained "songs about such need-to-know topics as John Rambo ("First Blood"), sharks ("Killer From the Deep") and, umm, thrash ("Thrasher") abound in all their escapist ridiculousness."<ref>Stewart-Panko, Kevin.

Originally scheduled for issue in early 2007,<ref name="EvileSigning"/> ''Enter the Grave'' was released outside of North America and Japan on August 27, 2007 by [[Earache Records]] and debuted at number 33 on the [[UK Rock Chart]].<ref name="ETGUKRock">{{cite web|title =Evile: 'Enter The Grave' Lands On U.K. 'Rock Albums' Chart| author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=04 September 2007|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=80044|accessdate=05 April 2010}}</ref> Released in North America and Japan almost one month later on September 25 by Earache Records and Howling Bull Records respectively,<ref name="ETGUSIssueDate">{{cite web|title =Evile: 'Enter The Grave' U.S. Release Date Announced| author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=11 June 2007|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=74429|accessdate=05 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="ETGJapanIssueDate">{{cite web|title =Evile: Japanese Version Of 'Enter The Grave' To Include Bonus Tracks| author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=01 September 2007|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=79908|accessdate=05 April 2010}}</ref> the album sold 200 copies in the United States during its first week of release.<ref name="ETGUSSales">{{cite web|title =Dethklok, Down, Arch Enemy, The Bled First-Week Sales Revealed| author = | publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=03 October 2007|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=82007|accessdate=05 April 2010}}</ref> It's Japanese edition included the bonus demo tracks "Darkness Shall Bring Death" and "Sacrificial", both of which were also available as an exclusive red 7" single vinyl.<ref name="ETGJapanIssueDate"/> A limited-edition "redux" version of the album was issued on October 13 in Europe and on October 28 in North America, housed in a slipcase. This re-release included three bonus tracks, an ''Enter the Grave'' patch, a guitar pick, and a two-hour DVD including the entire full-length played live in rehearsal, live footage from Evile's February 2008 European tour with [[Megadeth]], band interviews, and exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the group on the road.<ref name="ThrasherVideo"/>

Writing mostly favourable reviews of the album, many journalists referenced eighties thrash groups, particularly Exodus, Slayer and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. Awarding the album eight out of ten stars, Dom Lawson of ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' described ''Enter the Grave'' as "a monstrous, life-affirming metal album that craftily welds misty-eyed nostalgia for the glory days of Exodus, Testament and [[Arise (Sepultura album)|Arise]]-era [[Sepultura]] to contemporary sonic values".<ref>Lawson, Dom. ''Enter the Grave'' review. ''Classic Rock''. October 2007.</ref> ''[[Rock Sound]]'' writer Ronnie Kerswell observed that "title track "Enter the Grave" nods towards Slayer's classic "[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]"", and summarized by calling the full-length "old school as fuck", while awarding ''Enter the Grave'' eight out of ten stars.<ref>Kerswell, Ronnie. ''Enter the Grave'' review. ''Rock Sound''. October 2007.</ref> Dave Ling of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' gave the album eight out of ten stars as well, feeling that "with the galloping likes of "Bathe In Blood", "Thrasher" and "First Blood", Evile have fulfilled their side of the deal".<ref>Ling, Dave. ''Enter the Grave'' review. ''Metal Hammer''. October 2007.</ref> Chris Kee of ''[[Zero Tolerance Magazine]]'' noted that "the influences are easy to spot - [[Metallica]], Exodus, Testament, Forbidden, [[Laaz Rockit]], Slayer", but still called ''Enter the Grave'' as "a triumph, a resounding war cry from the spearhead of the new UK thrash assault", awarding four and a half out of five stars.<ref name ="ETGZTReview"/> 

Ian Webster of wrote that ""First Blood" is ultra-Exodus and goes head to head with the Slayer attack of "Schizophrenia" and "Armoured Assault"", and hailed the album as "the best UK thrash debut since [[Sabbat (band)|Sabbat]]'s ''[[History of a Time to Come]]''", awarding nine out of ten stars.<ref name="ETGTerrorizerReview"/> Giving ''Enter the Grave'' four out of five stars, ''[[Kerrang!]]'''s James Hoare commented that the album was "honed on a steady diet of early Slayer, [[Sacred Reich]] and [[Nuclear Assault]]", summarizing the full-length as "an absolute hair-swirling, air-punching beast".<ref>Hoare, James. ''Enter the Grave'' review. ''Kerrang!''. August 2007.</ref> ''Terrorizer'' dubbed ''Enter the Grave'' the nineteenth best album of 2007,<ref name="ETG19thTerrorizer">{{cite web|title =
