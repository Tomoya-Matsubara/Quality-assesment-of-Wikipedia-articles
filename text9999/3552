First introduced by designer Alexander McQueen two years ago, Gisele, now 20, is the world's top cover girl, taking to more than 1,600 catwalks and earning a reported $7,000 an hour. When she struts her trademark runway walk<U+2014>sassy and high-stepping, like a filly in tall grass<U+2014>hearts beat faster from Milan to Manhattan.
