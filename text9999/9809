'''''Verbascum thapsus''''' ('''great mullein''' or '''common mullein''') is a species of [[Verbascum|mullein]] native to Europe, northern Africa, and Asia, and introduced in the Americas and Australia. 

It is a hairy [[biennial plant]] that can grow to {{convert|2|m}} tall or more. Its small yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows from a large [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]] of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but prefers well-lit disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the [[soil seed bank]]. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively [[invasive species|invasive]], since its seeds require open ground to [[germination|germinate]]. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive [[Tillage|tilling]]. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.

It is widely used for herbal remedies, with well-established [[emollient]] and [[astringent]] properties. Mullein remedies are especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in [[topical]] applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant has also been used to make [[dye]]s and [[torch]]es.

== Taxonomy ==
For the purpose of [[botanical nomenclature]], ''Verbascum thapsus'' was first described by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in his 1753 ''{{lang|la|[[Species Plantarum]]}}''. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''thapsus'' had been first used by [[Theophrastus]] (as {{lang|el|[[:wikt:<U+0398><U+03AC><U+03C8><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+0398><U+03AC><U+03C8><U+03BF><U+03C2>]]}}, ''{{lang|el|Thapsos}}'')<ref name="carnoy"/> for an unspecified herb from the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] settlement of Thapsos, near modern [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]],<ref name="carnoy">{{fr icon}}{{cite book| last=Carnoy| first=A. |title=Dictionnaire <U+00E9>tymologique des noms grecs de plantes| year=1959|location=Louvain| publisher= Publications Universitaires| oclc=3284108}}</ref><ref>{{sv icon}} [http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/scrophularia/verba/verbtha.html Den virtuella Floran: ''Verbascum thapsus''], retrieved on November 6, 2009.</ref> though it is often assimilated to the ancient [[Tunisia]]n city of [[Thapsus]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Charters|first=Michael L.|title=Plant name: T| work= California Plant Names: Latin and Greek Meanings and Derivations| url=http://www.calflora.net/botanicalnames/pageT.html#thapsus|publisher=Calflora.net| accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref>

At the time, no [[type specimen]] was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it was assigned to specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only ''V.&nbsp;thapsus'' specimen.{{#tag:ref|The lectotypification is usually attributed to Arthur Huber-Morath (1971) ''Denkschriften der Schweizerischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft''  87:43. Some disagree since Huber-Morath did not specifically cite sheet 242.1, and credit instead L. H. Cramer, in Dassanayake & Fosberg (1981) ''A Revised Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon'' 3:389.<ref name="florida-atlas">{{Cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus'': citation| url=http://www.florida.plantatlas.usf.edu/Plant.aspx?id=1757| work=Atlas of Florida vascular Plants | publisher=Institute for Systematic Botany |accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref>|group=note}} The species had previously been designated as [[type species]] for ''[[Verbascum]]''.<ref>{{cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus''| url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/research-curation/projects/linnaean-typification/detail.dsml?ID=925400| work=Linnaean Plant Name Typification Project| publisher=Natural History Museum| accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> European plants exhibit considerable [[phenotype|phenotypical]] variation,<ref name="BoCW"/> which has led to the plant acquiring many [[synonymy|synonyms]] over the years.<ref name="florida-atlas"/><ref>{{Cite web| title=''Verbascum thapsus'' synonymy| url=http://www.northernontarioflora.ca/chklst.cfm?speciesid=1004482| publisher=Northern Ontario Plant Database|accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> Introduced American populations show much less variation.<ref name="BoCW"/>

The taxonomy of ''Verbascum'' has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve M<U+00FC>rbeck's monographies in the 1930s, with the exception of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the floras of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, M<U+00FC>rbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In M<U+00FC>rbeck's classification, ''V.&nbsp;thapsus'' is placed in section ''Bothrospermae'' subsect. ''Fasciculata'' (or sect. ''Verbascum'' subsect. ''Verbascum'' depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as ''[[Verbascum nigrum]]'' (black or dark mullein), ''[[Verbascum lychnitis]]'' (white mullein) and ''[[Verbascum sinuatum]]'' (wavy-leaved mullein).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Farideh |last1=Attar |first2=Atefeh |last2=Keshvari |first3=Ahmad |last3=Ghahreman |first4=Shahin |last4=Zarre |first5=Fatemeh |last5=Aghabeigi |display-authors=1 |year=2007 |title=Micromorphological studies on Verbascum (Scrophulariaceae) in Iran with emphasis on seed surface, capsule ornamentation and trichomes |journal=Flora <U+2013> Morphology, Distribution, Functional Ecology of Plants |volume=202 |issue=2 |pages=169<U+2013>175 |doi=10.1016/j.flora.2006.04.001}}</ref><ref name="iberica"/>

=== Subspecies and hybrids ===

There are three usually recognized [[subspecies]]:
* ''V.&nbsp;thapsus'' subsp. ''thapsus''; type, widespread.
* ''V.&nbsp;thapsus'' subsp. ''crassifolium'' (Lam.) Murb.; Mediterranean region and to 2000 metres in southwestern Austria.<ref name=schmeil/> (syn. subsp. ''montanum'' (Scrad.) Bonnier & Layens)
* ''V.&nbsp;thapsus'' subsp. ''giganteum'' (Willk.) Nyman; Spain, endemic.
In all subspecies but the type, the lower stamens are also hairy.<ref>{{ca icon}} {{cite web|title=''Verbascum thapsus'' L. subsp. ''montanum'' (Schrad.)

''giganteum'' and subsp. ''crassifolium'' were originally described as species.<ref name="FlEu"/> Due to its morphological variation, ''V.&nbsp;thapsus'' has had a great many subspecies described.

Great mullein is a biennial and generally requires [[vernalization|winter dormancy]] before it can flower.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> This dormancy is linked to [[starch]] degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and [[gibberellin]] application bypasses this requirement.<ref name="phyt"/> Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and 40&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or very close to the soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.<ref name="Hoshovsky"/>

Seeds germinate in spring and summer. Those that germinate in autumn produce plants that overwinter if they are large enough, while rosettes less than 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) across die in winter. After flowering the entire plant usually dies at the end of its second year,<ref name="Hoshovsky"/> but some individuals, especially in the northern parts of the range, require a longer growth period and flower in their third year. Under better growing conditions, some individuals flower in the first year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reinartz|first=James A.|title=Life History Variation of Common Mullein (''Verbascum Thapsus''): I.

== Uses ==
Great mullein has been used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and breathing ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an [[astringent]] and [[emollient]], as it contains [[mucilage]], several [[saponin]]s, [[coumarin]] and [[glycoside]]s. [[Dioscorides]] recommended it for diseases of the [[lung]] and it is now widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included [[dye]]ing and making [[torch]]es.
