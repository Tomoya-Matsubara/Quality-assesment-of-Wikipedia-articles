'''Iowa Highway 182''' ('''Iowa&nbsp;182''') is a {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[state highway (Iowa)|state highway]] in the northwestern corner of [[Iowa]].  It begins at [[U.S. Route 18 (Iowa)|U.S. Route 18]] (US&nbsp;18) in [[Inwood, Iowa|Inwood]] and ends at [[Iowa Highway 9|Iowa&nbsp;9]] southeast of [[Larchwood, Iowa|Larchwood]].  The highway has been in the primary highway system since 1930, when it was known as [[Iowa Highway 26|Iowa&nbsp;26]].  On January 1, 1969, Iowa&nbsp;26 and Iowa&nbsp;182 swapped designations.

==Route description==
Iowa Highway 182 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 18 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;18]] (US&nbsp;18) and County Road&nbsp;A42 (CR&nbsp;A42).  At the intersection, eastbound US&nbsp;18 approaches from the west, eastbound US&nbsp;18 approaches from the south, and CR&nbsp;A42 approaches from the east.  Iowa&nbsp;182 travels north through Inwood for {{convert|1|mi}} and continues due north through  the farmland of [[Lyon County, Iowa|Lyon County]] for {{convert|8|mi}} to an intersection with [[Iowa Highway 9]].<ref name="IowaDOT" />  The intersection with Iowa&nbsp;9 is very similar to the intersection with US&nbsp;18; eastbound Iowa&nbsp;9 approaches from the north and westbound Iowa 9 approaches from the east.<ref name="current DOT map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Iowa Department of Transportation]]|title=Transportation Map|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/pdf/current/stmapmain.pdf|year=2010|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
Between 1930 and 1968, the highway now known as Iowa&nbsp;182 was called [[Iowa Highway 26|Iowa&nbsp;26]].  This was the second instance of Iowa&nbsp;26.  The first was designated in 1920 with the rest of the primary highway system.  It was originally a [[spur route]] from Primary Road No. 19 (now US&nbsp;18) to [[Rock Valley, Iowa|Rock Valley]].<ref name=DOT1919>{{cite map|publisher=[[Iowa State Highway Commission]]|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1919-front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1919|at=Top left corner|format=PDF|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>  Iowa&nbsp;26 was extended north from Rock Valley back to US&nbsp;18 in 1929.<ref name=DOT1929>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa State Highway Commission|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1929-front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1929|at=Top left corner|format=PDF|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>

In 1930, US&nbsp;18 was rerouted in [[Lyon County, Iowa|Lyon]] and [[Sioux County, Iowa|Sioux]] counties.  The new routing of US&nbsp;18 went through Rock Valley, thus eliminating the need for Iowa&nbsp;26, which had connected Rock Valley to US&nbsp;18.  The Iowa&nbsp;26 designation was moved northwest.  It replaced County Road S, which followed the same course Iowa&nbsp;182 now follows.<ref name=DOT1930>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa State Highway Commission|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1930-front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1930|at=Top left corner|format=PDF|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref><ref name=DOT1931>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa State Highway Commission|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1931-front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1931|at=Top left corner|format=PDF|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref> 

On January 1, 1969, the [[Iowa State Highway Commission]], now known as the Iowa Department of Transportation, renumbered several [[state highway (Iowa)|state highway]]s.  The changes to the highway system fixed a number of issues: creating continuous route numbers across state lines, removing duplicate route numbers where they were unnecessary, and extending route numbers in some locations.<ref name="TH Jan1969">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LWNFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KbwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=7131%2C1694993|title=New Iowa Map Goes on Sale|date=January 14, 1969|work=[[Telegraph-Herald]]|accessdate=January 9, 2011|location=Dubuque, Iowa}}</ref>  In this case, the former Iowa&nbsp;182 in [[Allamakee County, Iowa|Allamakee County]] crossed into Minnesota and became [[Minnesota State Highway 26|Trunk Highway 26]].<ref name=DOT1968>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa State Highway Commission|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1968_front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1968|section=A-B1, A-B23|format=PDF|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>  The two routes' numbers were switched and have remained the same since then.<ref name=DOT1969>{{cite map|publisher=Iowa State Highway Commission|url=http://www.iowadotmaps.com/msp/historical/pdf/1969_front.pdf|title=Iowa State Highway Map|year=1969|section=A-B1, A-B23|format=PDF|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>
