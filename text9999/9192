The '''Manhattan Beach Branch''' or '''Manhattan Beach Division''' was a line of the [[Long Island Rail Road]], running from [[Fresh Pond, Queens]] south to [[Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[United States]]. It opened in 1877 and 1878 as the main line of the '''New York and Manhattan Beach Railway'''. The tracks from [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] south to Manhattan Beach were removed from 1938 to 1941,<ref name=steel>Ron Ziel and George H. Foster, Steel Rails to the Sunrise, <U+00A9>1965</ref><!--page 38--> while most of the rest is now the freight-only [[Bay Ridge Branch]].

At Manhattan Beach, the line extended east to Oriental Beach, and a branch to the [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] was provided north of [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]]. Other lines in the Manhattan Beach Division included the West Brighton Beach Division (Culver Line),{{Fact|date=February 2007}}<!--was this actually part of the MB Division, or a separate LIRR division?--> [[Bay Ridge Branch]], and Evergreen Branch.

==History==
[[Image:1878 Manhattan Beach Railway.jpg|thumb|200px|1878 map, including the short-lived Prospect Park Division]]
Planning for a line to [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] began in 1870 by the New York and Hempstead Plains Railroad (which built the [[Southern Hempstead Branch]] from [[Valley Stream, NY|Valley Stream]] to [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead]]). By 1873, the line was to run from Bay Ridge to [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]], where it would join the LIRR's [[Atlantic Avenue Division]] to [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]]. The [[panic of 1873]] struck after much work had been done in grading the new line.<ref>[[Vincent F. Seyfried]], [[wikisource:The Long Island Rail Road: A Comprehensive History, Part One: South Side R.R. of L.I.|The Long Island Rail Road: A Comprehensive History, Part One: South Side R.R. of L.I.]], <U+00A9>1961</ref>

The '''New York, Bay Ridge and Jamaica Railroad''' was incorporated on [[November 20]], [[1875]]<ref name=valuation>[[Interstate Commerce Commission]], [http://broadway.pennsyrr.com/rail/prr/Corphist/nyb_mb.html Valuation Report: New York, Brooklyn and Manhattan Beach]</ref> to complete the work and operate the line to Jamaica, using the [[Brooklyn and Rockaway Beach Railroad]] (Canarsie Line) from [[New Lots, Brooklyn|New Lots]] to East New York and the LIRR Atlantic Avenue Division to Jamaica.<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Rapid Transit|md=January 28|y=1876|page=4}}</ref> The first piece, from the Bay Ridge Ferry (to [[South Ferry, Manhattan]]) to the crossing of the [[Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad]] (West End Line) at [[New Utrecht, Brooklyn|New Utrecht]], opened on [[August 23]], [[1876]].

The Kings County Central Railroad was incorporated in 1877 by Electus B. Litchfield and Austin Corbin to build from [[downtown Brooklyn]] via the east side of [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] to a connection with the NYBR&J east of Manhattan Beach, and to be leased by the NYBR&J.<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Quick Transit|md=July 20|y=1877|page=2}}</ref> The line, operated by the NY&MB as its Prospect Park Division (along with the Bay Ridge and Greenpoint Divisions),<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Manhattan Beach Railway|md=August 26|y=1878|page=1}}</ref> was opened [[June 29]], [[1878]] to Prospect Park,<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Coney Island|md=June 28|y=1878|page=1}}</ref><ref name=KCC>{{cite BDE|title=Opened|md=June 30|y=1878|page=4}}</ref> but was a failure and closed for good at the end of the 1878 season.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The '''Eastern Railroad of Long Island''' was organized on [[November 28]], [[1878]]<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1878%20June%2006.pdf PRR Chronology, 1878]|126&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 129497 bytes -->}}, June 2006 Edition</ref> to build a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] line from [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]] on the NY&MB east via [[Woodhaven, Queens|Woodhaven]], [[Clarenceville, Queens|Clarenceville]], [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]], [[Springfield, Queens|Springfield]], [[Woodsburgh, NY|Woodsburgh]]<!--via a branch?-->, [[Valley Stream, NY|Valley Stream]], [[East Rockaway, NY|East Rockaway]], [[Christian Hook, New York|Christian Hook]], [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]], [[Merrick, NY|Merrick]], and [[South Oyster Bay, NY|South Oyster Bay]] to [[Babylon, NY|Babylon]] in competition with the LIRR's [[Southern Railroad Division]]. Corbin, who owned a summer house near Babylon,<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Railroads|md=October 19|y=1878|page=4}}</ref> put up the money to build the road, which was also planned to cross the [[Great South Bay|South Bay]] near [[Amityville, NY|Amityville]] to [[Fire Island, New York|Fire Island]].<ref>{{cite BDE|title=More Steam|md=April 12|y=1879|page=6}}</ref>

However, Corbin acquired a controlling interest in the Long Island Rail Road on [[November 29]], [[1880]]<ref>{{cite BDE|title=A New Era|md=November 30|y=1880|page=4}}</ref> and became [[list of presidents of the Long Island Rail Road|president]] on [[January 1]], [[1881]]. In December 1881,<!--month confirmed by 5-27-1883 article--> the LIRR leased the NY&MB and NYBR&J as the '''Manhattan Beach Division''',<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Manhattan Beach|md=May 24|y=1883|page=6}}</ref> with plans to change it to [[standard gauge]] and build connections to the [[Atlantic Avenue Division]] and [[Montauk Division]].<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Leased|md=December 9|y=1881|page=4}}</ref> The lines from East New York to Manhattan Beach and Bay Ridge were re-gauged after the 1882 season, and the '''Long Island City and Manhattan Beach Railroad''' (incorporated [[February 24]], [[1883]]) built a connection from the new Cooper Avenue Junction north to another new junction, Fresh Pond Junction, on the Montauk.<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Preparing for Summer Travel|md=May 27|y=1883|page=1}}</ref><!--was a third rail added or was a transfer required from Greenpoint? if so, where?--> Trains began running from [[Flatbush Avenue (LIRR station)|Flatbush Avenue]] to Manhattan Beach via the Atlantic Avenue Division on [[May 30]], [[1883]],<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Long Island Railroad|md=May 29|y=1883|page=1}}</ref> and from [[Long Island City (LIRR station)|Long Island City]] via the Montauk Division on [[June 2]], [[1883]].<ref>{{cite BDE|title=The New Route to Manhattan Beach|md=June 5|y=1883|page=1}}</ref>

For the 1884 season (opened [[May 29]]), the double-track [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] line between East New York and Greenpoint was replaced with a single [[standard gauge]] track.<ref>{{cite BDE|title=A New Track and New Cars|md=May 24|y=1884|page=4}}</ref><!--mentions Cooper Avenue station; trains started running through to Manhattan Beach from Greenpoint again, unless they did via a third rail in 1883--> 1885 was the last year that trains ran to Greenpoint, and the line between Greenpoint and the Bushwick Branch crossing was abandoned in October;<ref name="valuation G&ER">[[Interstate Commerce Commission]], [http://broadway.pennsyrr.com/rail/prr/Corphist/g_er.html Valuation Report: Glendale and East River]</ref> they started using Bushwick instead in the 1886 season.<ref>{{cite BDE|title=Manhattan Beach|md=June 12|y=1886|page=1}}</ref><!--what was the ex-Greenpoint line called then?--> Passenger trains stopped serving the line, later the Evergreen Branch, to Bushwick in 1894.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The New York, Bay Ridge and Jamaica Railroad, New York and Manhattan Beach Railroad, and Long Island City and Manhattan Beach Railroad merged on [[August 27]], [[1885]] to form the '''New York, Brooklyn and Manhattan Beach Railway'''.<ref name=valuation/> This company was merged into the LIRR on [[June 19]], [[1925]],<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1925%20Jul%2004.wd.pdf PRR Chronology, 1925]|101&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 103936 bytes -->}}, June 2004 Edition</ref> and the Glendale and East River Railroad was abvorbed in 1928.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The line south of Manhattan Beach Junction was upgraded to a [[grade-separated]] [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]] shared with the [[Brighton Beach Line]] during 1907-1909. A [[New York State]] prohibition on [[racetrack]] [[gambling|wagering]] and the decline of the more [[upscale]] [[resort]]s on [[Coney Island]], combined with more direct and lower-priced competition from nearby [[rapid transit]] and [[streetcar]] lines, led to a rapid decline in the Manhattan Beach's economic viability. Passenger service ended completely in 1924, and freight ended in the early 1930s.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
