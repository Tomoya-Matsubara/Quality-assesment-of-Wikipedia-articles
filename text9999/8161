==Career==

Aaron Neville has had a career as a solo artist and as one of the [[Neville Brothers]]. Of mixed [[African American]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] heritage, his music also features [[Cajun]] influence. 

Aaron is noted for his unusual [[vibrato]] singing style, which he says was inspired by [[Gene Autry]]'s [[yodelling]]. 

With his solo career, Neville is best known for his [[Grammy]]-winning 1989 duets with [[Linda Ronstadt]], "[[Don't Know Much]]" and "All My Life," as well as his first - and to date his biggest - hit, [[1966]]'s "[[Tell It Like It Is]]," which was successfully covered by [[Heart (band)|Heart]] in [[1980]].  His other hits have included "[[Everybody Plays The Fool]]," his successful 1991 cover of the [[1972]] [[Main Ingredient]] soul classic; "Don't Take Away My Heaven", "Hercules" and "Can't Stop My Heart From Loving You (The Rain Song)." Neville's biggest solo successes have been on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart, where "Don't Know Much," "All My Life," and "Everybody Plays The Fool" all reached Number One.

Neville's son [[Ivan Neville]] is also a musician and released an album, ''If My Ancestors Could See Me Now,'' in [[1988]], which yielded a Top 40 hit with "Not Just Another Girl." Ivan has also performed with the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]], and played bass for [[Keith Richards]] on his first solo tour.

==References in pop culture==
Neville<U+2014>his high pitched, dramatic singing style in particular, as well as his penchant for [[cocoa butter]] moisturizer<U+2014>is parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', portrayed by [[Horatio Sanz]].  One example is on the [[February 19, 2005]] [[episode]], in which "[[Judge]] Aaron Neville" sings his verdicts and repeatedly applies cocoa butter moisturizer to his skin.  He was also parodied on ''[[Family Guy]]'' when Peter bought an Aaron Neville megaphone which transformed his voice into Neville's singing style.  He has also been parodied on ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''.  In episode #305 "[[My Lucky Night]]" Dr. Chris Turk imitates Neville's singing voice into a tape recorder.  Standup comedian [[Pablo Francisco]] also does an impersonation of Neville, claiming his voice sounds like someone "trying to find a radio station". 

In [[August 2005]] his home in [[Eastern New Orleans]] was destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina]]; he evacuated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] before the hurricane hit.  He has yet to return to the city, causing the New Orleans Jazz Fest to change its tradition of having the Neville Brothers close the festival.  Neville performed [[Randy Newman]]'s "[[Louisiana 1927]]" during [[NBC]]'s ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'' on [[September 2]], [[2005]].

In [[2006 in music|2006]], Neville sang "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", alongside singer [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Dr John]] on [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] at [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit]].

The album, produced by [[Stewart Levine]], features collaborations between Aaron and [[Chaka Khan]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Chris Botti]], [[David Sanborn]], [[Art Neville]], and others.  The album's first single was a remake of [[The Impressions]]' 1963 classic "It's All Right."

Aaron made a guest appearance on an episode of the soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' on October 27, 2006.<ref name="young">{{cite web | title = Aaron Neville To Perform on 'The Young & The Restless | url = http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/10/02/aaron_neville_to_perform_on_the_young_aa | accessdate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>  He sang the classic hits "[[Stand By Me (song)|Stand By Me]]" and "[[Ain't No Sunshine]]", from his new album, ''[[Bring It on Home<U+2026>The Soul Classics]]''.
