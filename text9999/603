{{chinesetext}}
The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE &ndash; 220 CE) of [[History of China|ancient China]] was the second [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty of China]], following the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221&ndash;206 BCE). It was divided into the periods of Western Han (202 BCE &ndash; 9 CE) and Eastern Han (25&ndash;220 CE), and briefly interrupted by the [[Xin Dynasty]] (9&ndash;23 CE) of [[Wang Mang]]. The capital of Western Han was [[Chang'an]], and the capital of Eastern Han was [[Luoyang]]. The [[Emperor of China|emperor]] headed the government, [[Promulgation|promulgating]] all written laws, serving as [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces, and presiding as the chief executive official. He appointed all government officials who earned a salary of 600 [[bushel]]s of grain or more (though these salaries were largely paid in [[Ancient Chinese coinage|coin cash]]) with the help of advisors who reviewed each nominee. Near the beginning of the dynasty, [[Kings of the Han Dynasty|semi-autonomous regional kings]] rivaled the emperor's authority. This autonomy was greatly diminished when the imperial court enacted reforms following the threats to central control like the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]]. The [[empress dowager]] could either be the emperor's actual or symbolic mother, and was in practice more powerful than the emperor, as she could override his decisions. The emperor's executive powers could also be practiced by any official upon whom he bestowed the Staff of Authority. These powers included the right to execute criminals without the imperial court's permission.

The highest officials in the central bureaucracy, who provided advisory, censorial, executive, and judicial roles in governing the empire, consisted of [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members known as [[Three Excellencies|the Excellencies]], heads of large specialized ministries known as the [[Nine Ministers]], and various metropolitan officials of the capital region.<ref group="note">Most of the English renditions of the Chinese titles used in this article are taken from [[Rafe de Crespigny]]'s  ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms'' (2007); alternate renditions are provided in parentheses and are taken from Hans Bielenstein's ''The Bureaucracy of Han Times'' (1980) and Wang Yu-ch'uan's ''An Outline of The Central Government of The Former Han Dynasty'' (1949). Note that sometimes there is only one variant English title in the parentheses; this means that Bielenstein and Wang used the same English rendition.</ref> Distinguished salary-ranks were granted to officials in the bureaucracy, nobles of the imperial family, concubines of the harem, and military officers of the armed forces.

Local government divisions, in descending order by size, were the [[Zhou (country subdivision)|province]], [[commandery]], [[County (China)|county]], and [[District (China)|district]]. Local [[fief]]s of [[Chinese nobility|the nobility]] included the kingdom, which was modeled largely upon the regular commandery, as well as the [[marquess]]ate, modelled largely upon the regular county. Although the central government's monopolies on salt, iron, and liquor eventually failed and were relinquished back to private production, the government successfully nationalized the issuing of coin currency through its imperial [[Mint (coin)|mint]], which lasted from 113 BCE until the [[End of the Han Dynasty|end of the dynasty]]. The [[conscription]] system for commoners as non-professional soldiers was reduced in size in favor of a [[volunteer army]] and a substitution tax by Eastern Han. A small professional [[standing army]] existed throughout Western and Eastern Han. During times of crisis, large [[militia]]s were raised and certain officer titles were revived for temporary use.

During the Han Dynasty, the power a government official exercised was determined by his annual salary-rank, measured in grain units known as ''shi'' ([[Wiktionary:<U+77F3>|<U+77F3>]], also pronounced ''dan'', approximately 35 L / 1 [[Bushel|U.S. bu]]). However, approximately half an official's salary in grain was made in payments of [[Ancient Chinese coinage|cash coins]],<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 131; de Crespigny (2007), 1221.</ref> the standard of which, after 119 BCE, was the ''wushu'' (<U+4E94><U+9296>) coin measuring 3.2 g (0.11 oz).<ref>Nishijima (1986), 587.</ref> The other half of an official's salary consisted of unhusked grain and [[husk]]ed grain measured in ''hu'' (<U+89F3>, approximately 20 L / 676 [[Fluid ounce|oz]]); since one ''hu'' of unhusked grain was equal to 100 coins and one ''hu'' of husked grain was equal to 160 coins, the conversion ratio for unhusked grain to husked grain was 10 to 6 (see table below).<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 127 & 131.</ref> [[Three Excellencies|The most senior officials]] in central government earned a 10,000-''shi'' salary. The officials who oversaw [[Nine Ministers|nine specialized ministries]] each earned the Fully 2,000-''shi'' rank, while the magistrate of a [[county]] earned a 600-''shi'' rank.<ref>de Crespigny (2007) 1221; Bielenstein (1980), 11&ndash;17; Hucker (1975), 159.</ref> Occasionally, emperors bestowed luxurious gifts of wine, foodstuffs, and [[History of silk|silk clothes]] upon high officials.

{{see|Society and culture of the Han Dynasty|History of the Han Dynasty}}
====Qin's imperial model====
[[File:Arm<U+00E9>e de terre cuite, fouille du tombeau de l'empereur Qin, Xi'an.jpg|thumb|The [[Terracotta Army]], assembled by 210 BCE for the burial of Qin Shi Huang (r. 221&ndash;210 BCE), the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty]]
[[Qin Shi Huang]], first ruler of the [[Qin Dynasty]], established China's imperial system of government in 221 BCE after unifying the [[Warring States Period|Warring States]] through conquest. For a time, the rulers of the Warring States claimed nominal allegiance to an overlord king of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1050 &ndash; 256 BCE), yet the Zhou kings' political power and prestige was less than that of later Chinese emperors.<ref>Ebrey (1999), 60&ndash;61; Wang (1949), 139.</ref> The imperial system fell apart after the fall of Qin in 206 BCE. However, following [[Chu-Han contention|Han's victory over Chu]], the King of Han reestablished the imperial system and is known posthumously as [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] (r. 202&ndash;195 BCE).<ref>Davis (2001), 45&ndash;46.</ref> 

The Han system of imperial government borrowed many of its core features from the model set forth by the Qin Dynasty. For example, Gaozu's Chancellor [[Xiao He]] (d. 193 BCE) integrated much of the statutes of the Qin law code into the newly-compiled Han law code.<ref>Hulsew<U+00E9> (1986), 525&ndash;526; Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 23&ndash;24; Hansen (2000), 110&ndash;112.</ref> Yet Gaozu's establishment of central control over only a third of the empire<U+2014>the other two-thirds of territory ruled by semi-autonomous kingdoms<U+2014>strayed from Qin's imperial model which gave the emperor direct control over all of China.<ref>Wang (1949), 135.</ref> However, a series of reforms would eventually strip away any vestiges of the kingdoms' independence. Han emperors would thereafter enjoy full and direct control over China as the first Qin emperor had.<ref name="hucker 1975 152"/> The Han court's gradual move towards reestablishing central control can also be seen in its monetary policy. While the Qin regime installed a nationwide standard [[Ancient Chinese coinage|currency]],<ref>Hinsch (2002), 28.</ref> the early Western Han regime oscillated between abolishing and legalizing private mints, commandery-level mints, and kingdom-level mints issuing various coins.<ref name="nishijima 1986 586 587">Nishijima (1986), 586&ndash;587.</ref> In 113 BCE the Han court finally established a central-government monopoly over issuing a standard, nationwide currency.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 587&ndash;588; Bielenstein (1980), 47, 83.</ref>

====Roles, rights, and responsibilities====
[[Emperor of China|The emperor]], who enjoyed a paramount social status, was the head of the government administration. His rule was virtually [[Absolutism|absolute]], although civil officials, representing the competing interests of different state organs, scrutinized his decisions.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1216; Bielenstein (1980), 143; Hucker (1975), 149&ndash;150.</ref> Although the Grand Commandant had a nominal role as commander-in-chief, the emperor served as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.<ref>Wang (1949), 141&ndash;142.</ref> The emperor had the sole right to appoint central government officials whose salary-rank was 600-''shi'' or higher.<ref name="wang 1949 142">Wang (1949), 142.</ref> The emperor also appointed the leading officials at the provincial, commandery, and county levels of government.<ref name="wang 1949 142"/> Appointees to office were usually recommended men from the commanderies, family relatives of high officials, or student graduates of the [[Taixue|Imperial University]]. This institution was established in 124 BCE, and provided a [[Confucianism|Confucian]]-based education for those entering [[civil service]].<ref>Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 103; Kramers (1986), 754&ndash;756; Hucker, 156&ndash;157.</ref> 
{{multiple image| align = left | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = A pottery model of a palace from a Han Dynasty tomb; the entrances to the emperor's imperial palaces were strictly guarded by the Minister of the Guards, and if it was found that a commoner, official, or noble entered without explicit permission via a tally system, they were liable for execution.<ref>Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 68&ndash;69.</ref>| footer_align = left | image1 = Pottery palace.JPG | width1 = 150 | caption1  = | image2 = Pottery palace 1.JPG | width2 = 150| caption2  = }}

The emperor had the exclusive right to modify the [[Code (law)|law code]] and issue new laws in the form of imperial edicts (''zhao'' <U+8A54>) and decrees (''ling'' <U+4EE4>).<ref name="wang 1949 142"/> However, he often accepted the decisions and reforms suggested by his chief judicial minister, the Commandant of Justice.<ref name="wang 1949 142"/> The emperor also acted as the supreme judge. Any lawsuits which a county administration, then commandery administration, and then Minister of Justice could not resolve were deferred to the emperor.<ref name="wang 1949 143">Wang (1949), 143.</ref> 

The emperor's role as supreme judge could be temporarily duplicated by any official he designated in times of emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority (''Jiezhang'' <U+7BC0><U+6756>).<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1227 1228">de Crespigny (2007), 1227&ndash;1228.</ref> Roughly 2 m (6 ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as acting on behalf of the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1227 1228"/> Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1227 1228"/>

During the Qin Dynasty, the first Qin emperor's legitimacy to rule was ultimately decided by his ability to conquer others. However, by the time of [[Wang Mang]]'s (r. 9&ndash;23 CE) reign, the [[Mandate of Heaven]] was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority.<ref>Loewe (1994), 55.</ref> This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of [[Tian|Heaven]] over that of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Powers]] in 31 BCE.<ref>Loewe (1994), 55; Loewe (1986), 208; Csikszentmihalyi (2006), xxv&ndash;xxvi.</ref> Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179&ndash;104 BCE), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater [[Cosmology|cosmological]] cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu's]] (r. 141&ndash;87 BCE) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and bring an end to his reign.<ref>Ebrey (1999), 79; Loewe (1986), 201; de Crespigny (2007), 496, 592.</ref> He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.<ref>Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 71.</ref>

[[File:China.Terracotta statues007.jpg|thumb|left|A female servant and male advisor dressed in silk robes, ceramic figurines from the Western Han Era]]

====Court conferences====
Although the emperor held supreme power, he more often sought the advice of his cabinet and other ministers before making decisions and when revoking them.<ref name="wang 1949 173 174 bielenstein 1980 144 hucker 1975 150">Wang (1949), 173&ndash;174; Bielenstein (1980), 144; Hucker (1975), 150.</ref> He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (''tingyi'' <U+5EF7><U+8B70>). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation.<ref name="wang 1949 173 174 bielenstein 1980 144 hucker 1975 150"/> Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the [[Consensus decision-making|majority consensus]] of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 144; Wang (1949), 174&ndash;177; Hucker (1975), 150.</ref>

===Empress dowager===
When the emperor died without officially appointing a successor, his widow, the [[empress dowager]], had the sole right to appoint one of the late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1216 1217">de Crespigny (2007), 1216&ndash;1217.</ref> Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a father or brother, would assume control of the Imperial Secretariat.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1217">de Crespigny (2007), 1217.</ref> Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice and acceptance of the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also had the right to override his decisions.<ref>Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 72.</ref> The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction<U+2014>the [[consort clan]]<U+2014> was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under [[house arrest]].<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1218.</ref>

===Grand Tutor===

The post of Grand Tutor (''Taifu'' <U+592A><U+5085>), although given the highest civil status below the emperor, was not regularly occupied. The role was considered an honorary rather than substantive office.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1221">de Crespigny (2007), 1221.</ref> In Western Han,  a Grand Tutor was supposedly appointed at the beginning of each emperor's reign, and was not replaced until that emperor's death.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1221"/> However, only four Grand Tutors were appointed between 202 BCE &ndash; 6 CE.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 5">Bielenstein (1980), 5.</ref> In contrast, during Eastern Han, a new Grand Tutor was appointed when every emperor except [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146&ndash;168 CE) had a Grand Tutor installed at the beginning of their reigns.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 6">Bielenstein (1980), 6.</ref> The Grand Tutor's salary-rank was unspecified in literary sources, although it was likely higher than the 10,000-''shi'' rank.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 5"/> The Grand Tutor was nominally in charge of providing a young emperor with moral guidance, but it is doubtful that this role was ever taken seriously or formally conducted.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 5 6">Bielenstein (1980), 5&ndash;6.</ref> The post often served to deliberately block someone from obtaining a more important post, such as one of the Excellencies, while Grand Tutors were usually elder statesmen chosen for their age rather than merits (so they would die off quickly after being appointed).<ref name="bielenstein 1980 5 6"/>

===Excellencies===
{{main|Three Excellencies}}

====Title variations====

The Excellencies (''gong'', literally translated as "[[Chinese nobility|dukes]]") were the foremost officials in central government who formed [[Cabinet (government)|the cabinet]] during both Western and Eastern Han. For most of Western Han, the Excellencies were the Chancellor (''Chengxiang'' <U+4E1E><U+76F8>), the Imperial Counselor (''Yushi dafu'' <U+5FA1><U+53F2><U+5927><U+592B>), and the Grand Commandant (''Taiwei'' <U+592A><U+5C09>). The Great Commandant's post was irregularly filled, and it was retitled to Grand Marshal (''Da sima'' <U+5927><U+53F8><U+99AC>) in 119 BCE.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1221 bielenstein 1980 7 17">de Crespigny (2007), 1221; Bielenstein (1980), 7&ndash;17.</ref> In 8 BCE, the post of Imperial Counselor was abolished in favor of a Grand Excellency of Works (''da sikong'' <U+5927><U+53F8><U+7A7A>), and by 1 BCE the Chancellor's post was abolished and replaced by the Grand Excellency Over the Masses (''da situ'' <U+5927><U+53F8><U+5F92>).<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1221 bielenstein 1980 7 17"/> On June 8, 51 CE the prefix "Grand" (<U+5927>) was removed from the titles of the Excellency over the Masses and Excellency of Works, while the Grand Marshal was reinstated with the original title of Grand Commandant, and would remain so for the rest of Eastern Han.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1221 bielenstein 1980 7 17"/> The exact salary figures for the Excellencies before 8 BCE are unknown, although from that year forward they were given a 10,000-''shi'' salary-rank, in addition to periodic gifts which further boosted their incomes.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 7 & 11.</ref>

====Chancellor====
[[File:Jade Han Chine Guimet 2910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chinese jade|Jade-carved]] pendents in the shape of [[Chinese dragon]]s, 2nd century BCE, Western Han Era]]

During Western Han, the [[Chancellor of China|Chancellor]] was the chief civil official.<ref name="wang 1949 143 144">Wang (1949), 143&ndash;144.</ref> The duties of the chancellery were divided between a Right Chancellor (<U+53F3><U+4E1E><U+76F8>) and Left Chancellor (<U+5DE6><U+4E1E><U+76F8>) between 196 and 180 BCE. After 180 BCE, the Left Chancellor's post was merely titular and its incumbent had no real authority.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 7; Wang (1949), 143&ndash;144.</ref> The Western Han Chancellor oversaw state finances, logistics for military campaigns, registers for land and population, [[History of cartography|maps of the empire's territories]], annual provincial reports, high-profile lawsuits, and drafted the [[government budget]].<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 8; Wang (1949), 145&ndash;146.</ref> The Chancellor could directly appoint officials who were ranked 600-''shi'' or below, while he was also able to recommend nominees to the emperor for recruitment to the senior roles in central government.<ref name="wang 1949 145">Wang (1949), 145.</ref> The Chancellor was held responsible for the actions of officials he recommended and appointed, yet he could also punish inadequate officials without the emperor's consent.<ref name="wang 1949 145"/> 

Whenever the emperor was absent from a court conference but sought its advice, he relied on the chancellor to direct it and inform him of the resulting majority opinion. If the attending ministers were split into opposing factions of roughly equal size, the chancellor would listen to the positions of both sides and count the exact number of ministers who supported either opposing opinion.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 8; Wang (1949), 177; Hucker (1975), 150.</ref>

The Palace Writers (''Zhongshu'' <U+4E2D><U+66F8>) were originally palace [[eunuch]] secretaries (''Zhongshu kuan'' <U+4E2D><U+66F8><U+5B98>) from Emperor Wu's reign until 29 BCE, when they were staffed by regular officials. They usurped much of the Chancellor's powers by the end of the Western Han.<ref>Hucker (1975), 151.</ref> The position of Chancellor was abolished for much of Eastern Han and replaced by the Excellency over the Masses. However, in 208 CE the Excellency of Works [[Cao Cao]] (155&ndash;220 CE) assumed the revived post of Chancellor while acting as the ''de facto'' ruler over the court of [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] (r. 189&ndash;220 CE). Cao Cao also abolished the Grand Commandant and Excellency of Works while reinstating the Imperial Counselor.<ref>Hucker (1975), 152; Beck (1986), 352&ndash;353.</ref>

====Imperial Counselor====

====Grand Commandant====
{{see|History of the Han Dynasty}}
The Grand Commandant (also known as the Commander-in-Chief) was the head commander of the military in Western Han, yet his office was irregularly filled (from 205&ndash;202 BCE, from 196&ndash;195 BCE, from 189&ndash;177 BCE, from 154&ndash;150 BCE, and in 140 BCE).<ref>Wang (1949), 150; Bielenstein (1980), 10&ndash;11.</ref> After 119 BCE, the generals [[Huo Qubing]] (d. 117 BCE) and [[Wei Qing]] (d. 106 BCE) simultaneously held the title until their deaths, but when the post was revived in 87 BCE it became politicized when conferred as a [[regent]]'s title for [[Huo Guang]] (d. 68 BCE).<ref name="bielenstein 1980 10 11">Bielenstein (1980), 10&ndash;11.</ref> The regent was thus considered one of the Three Excellencies, although he was not technically part of the cabinet.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 10 11"/>
[[File:Nswag, dinastia han, cavallo e cavaliere.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Han painted pottery mounted cavalryman in armor and uniform]]

The Grand Commandant's office witnessed significant changes during the Eastern Han. Wang Mang separated the regent's role from the Grand Commandant's post during the [[Xin Dynasty]] (9&ndash;23 CE), since he did not want an active regent for his regime.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 12">Bielenstein (1980), 12.</ref> This was retained by Eastern Han, while the third Grand Commandant of Eastern Han appointed in 51 CE transformed his ministry into a primarily civilian one.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 12"/> Although the Eastern-Han Grand Commandant shared the same salary-rank as the other two Excellencies who were nominally considered his equals, he was nonetheless given ''de facto'' privilege as the most senior civil official.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1221; Bielenstein (1980), 12.</ref> However, his censorial jurisdiction now overlapped with the other two Excellencies (i.e. he was able to investigate the same officials in central and local government), who shared an advisory role to the emperor (policy suggestions could be submitted independently or jointly by all three cabinet members).<ref name="bielenstein 1980 11 12">Bielenstein (1980), 11&ndash;12.</ref> His various bureaus handled appointment, promotion, and demotion of officials, population registers and agriculture, the upkeep of transportation facilities, [[post office]]s, and [[courier]]s, civil law cases, granary storage, and military affairs.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 13.</ref> He was also given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of Ceremonies, Minister of the Household, and Minister of the Guards.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1221 1222">de Crespigny (2007), 1221&ndash;1222.</ref>

====Excellency over the Masses====

The Excellency over the Masses (also known as the Minister over the Masses) shared the same censorial and advisory roles as the other two Excellencies, the Excellency of Works and Grand Commandant.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 14">Bielenstein (1980), 14.</ref> Like his previous counterpart, the Chancellor, he must have been responsible for drawing up the annual budget, although contemporary sources fail to mention this point.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 14"/> Aside from the court conference, the Great Conference of leading officials across the empire was conducted by his ministry.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 14"/> The Chancellor's bureaus were also retained by the Excellency over the Masses, and were nearly identical to that of the new Eastern-Han Grand Commandant's bureaus.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 14"/> He was given formal powers to supervise three of the Nine Ministers: the Minister Coachman, Minister of Justice, and Minister Herald.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1222">de Crespigny (2007), 1222.</ref>

====Excellency of Works====

The Excellency of Works, also known as the Minister of Works, was less powerful than his previous counterpart, the Imperial Counselor.

===Nine Ministers===

The Nine Ministers, who were supervised by the Three Excellencies but not direct subordinates of the cabinet, each headed a specialized government ministry and held a salary-rank of Fully 2,000-''shi''.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1221&ndash;1222; Bielenstein (1980), 17; Wang (1949), 151.</ref> Along with the tripartite cabinet members, these ministers usually attended court conferences.<ref name="wang 1949 151">Wang (1949), 151.</ref>

====Minister of Ceremonies====
{{see|Science and technology of the Han Dynasty|Society and culture of the Han Dynasty}}
The Minister of Ceremonies (''Taichang'' <U+592A><U+5E38>) also known as Grand Master of Ceremonies, was the chief official in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers, and the maintenance of [[Ancestor worship|ancestral temples and altars]]. The role's title was changed to Upholder of Ceremonies (''Fengchang'' <U+5949><U+5E38>) from 195 to 144 BCE before reverting back to the original title. <ref>Wang (1949), 150&ndash;151; de Crespigny (2007), 1222; Bielenstein (1980), 17&ndash;23.</ref> Although his main concern was to link the emperor with the supernatural world and [[Tian|Heaven]], he was also given the task of setting educational standards for the [[Taixue|Imperial University]] (est. 124 BCE)<ref name="kramers 1986 754 756">Kramers (1986), 754&ndash;756.</ref> and the academic chairs (''boshi'' <U+535A><U+58EB>) who specialized in the [[Five Classics]], the canon of [[Confucianism]].<ref>Wang (1949), 152; de Crespigny (2007), 1222; Bielenstein (1980), 19.</ref> 

One of the Minister of Ceremonies' many subordinates was the Court Astronomer (''Taishi ling'' <U+592A><U+53F2><U+4EE4>; also known as the Prefect Grand Astrologer), who made [[Chinese astronomy|astronomical observations]] and drafted the annual [[Chinese calendar|lunisolar calendar]]. The Court Astronomer also upheld a [[literacy test]] of 9,000 [[Chinese characters|characters]] for nominees aspiring to become subordinate officials for either the Minister Steward or Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1222; Bielenstein (1980), 19.</ref> These nominees were often recommended subordinates of commandery-level Administrators.<ref name="wang 1949 152">Wang (1949), 152.</ref> Other subordinates of the Minister of Ceremonies reported illegal acts at ancestral temples, prepared sacrificial offerings of food and wine at shrines and temples, and arranged for the music and dancing that accompanied ceremonies.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 18">Bielenstein (1980), 18.</ref>

The Minister of the Household (''Guangluxun'' <U+5149><U+797F><U+52F3>), also known as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was originally titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (''Lang zhongling'' <U+90CE><U+4E2D><U+4EE4>) before 104 BCE. He was responsible for the emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot.<ref>Wang (1949), 150&ndash;153; de Crespigny (2007) 1222; Bielenstein (1980), 23&ndash;24.</ref> However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and [[harem]].<ref>de Crespigny (2007) 1222; Bielenstein (1980), 23.</ref> Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1222&ndash;1223; Bielenstein (1980), 24&ndash;27; Wang (1949), 152&ndash;153.</ref> The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as [[Xiaolian|Filial and Incorrupt]], while others could be relatives of high officials in central government.<ref>Wang (1949), 152&ndash;153; de Crespigny (2007), 1230.</ref> The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinates who provided an advisory role to the emperor;<ref name="wang 1949 153">Wang (1949), 153.</ref> these officials engaged in scholarly debates and were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently-deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1223; Bielenstein (1980), 25&ndash;26.</ref> Internuncios (''Yezhe'' <U+8B01><U+8005>), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (''Yezhe puye'' <U+8B01><U+8005><U+50D5><U+5C04>), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently-deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and [[Ethnic minorities in China|non-Han-Chinese peoples]] along the borders.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1223 & 1227; Beilenstein (1980), 26 & 30&ndash;31.</ref>

====Minister of the Guards====

The Minister of the Guards (''Weiwei'' <U+885B><U+5C09>) was also known as Commandant of the Guards), and briefly as the Prefect of the Palace Grandees (''Zhong da fuling'' <U+4E2D><U+5927><U+592B><U+4EE4>) during [[Emperor Jing of Han]]'s reign (r. 157&ndash;141 BCE) before reverting back to the original title. This Minister was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces.<ref>Wang (1949), 150&ndash;153; de Crespigny (2007), 1223; Bielenstein (1980), 31.</ref> The duties of his ministry were carried out by [[prefect]]s, one of whom controlled the gates where nominees for office were received and officials sent memorials to the throne.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1223; Bielenstein (1980), 31&ndash;32.</ref> To control and monitor the flow of traffic through the palace gates, the prefects used a complex passport system involving wooden and metal tallies. During an emergency, the tallies were collected and no-one was allowed to enter unless they breached the gates by force.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1223; Bielenstein (1980), 33.</ref> The guards were [[Conscription|conscripted]] peasants who served for a year's term as soldiers and were invited to attend a celebratory feast hosted by the emperor before demobilization.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1223; Bielenstein (1980), 31; Wang (1949), 153.</ref>

These stables housed [[Ferghana horse]]s that were imported or gathered as tribute from [[Central Asia]]n countries.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 35.</ref> 

In Eastern Han<U+2014>possibly due to the Coachman's influence over the transport of arms<U+2014>a prefect in charge of manufacturing bows, [[History of crossbows|crossbows]], swords, and armor for the military was transferred from the Minister Steward's ministry to that of the Minister Coachman.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 37 38">Bielenstein (1980), 37&ndash;38.</ref>

====Minister of Justice====

====Minister of the Imperial Clan====

While eight of the Nine Ministers could be of commoner origin, the post of Minister of the Imperial Clan (''Zongcheng'' <U+5B97><U+6B63>), also known as the Director of the Imperial Clan, was always occupied by a member of the imperial family.<ref name="hucker 1975 150">Hucker (1975), 150.</ref> He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1223&ndash;1224; Wang (1949), 150&ndash;151 & 155; Bielenstein (1980), 41.</ref> His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated at the beginning of each year.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 41; Wang (1949), 155.</ref> When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the imperial family, the Minister of the Imperial Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 41"/> This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 41"/> Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of the Imperial Clan.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 41"/>

The Minister of Finance (''Da sinong'' <U+5927><U+53F8><U+8FB2>) was also called the Grand Minister of Agriculture, and before 144 BCE, was known as Clerk of the Capital for Grain (''Zhisu neishi'' <U+6CBB><U+7C9F><U+5167><U+53F2>). This minister was the central government's [[treasurer]] for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1224; Bielenstein (1980), 43; Wang (1949), 150&ndash;151 & 155&ndash;156.</ref> While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 43.</ref> He was in charge of storing the [[poll tax]]es, which were gathered in coin cash, and [[land tax]], which was gathered as a proportion of farmers' annual crop yields.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 43; Wang (1949), 155.</ref> He was also responsible for setting the standards for [[units of measurement]].<ref name="bielenstein 1980 43">Bielenstein (1980), 43.</ref> In addition to reviewing tax collections, he could implement policies for price control exacted on certain commercial commodities.<ref>Wang (1949), 155&ndash;156; de Crespigny (2007), 1224; Bielenstein (1980), 43&ndash;44.</ref> 

During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's powers were limited to the public treasury, the Minister Steward being responsible for the emperor's private wealth.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1224.</ref> However, in Eastern Han, the responsibilities for the public treasury and the emperor's private wealth were amalgamated and entrusted solely to the Minister of Finance, which later proved disastrous when handled by irresponsible emperors such as [[Emperor Ling of Han|Ling]] (r. 168&ndash;189 CE).<ref>Wang (1949), 155; de Crespigny (2007), 1224.</ref> During Western Han, the Minister of Finance managed the government's [[Economy of the Han Dynasty#Private manufacture and government monopolies|monopolized salt and iron agencies]], which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1224; Bielenstein (1980), 43&ndash;44; Nishijima (1986), 584; Wagner (2001), 15&ndash;17; Wang (1949), 155&ndash;156.</ref> He also managed the government's brief monopoly over [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|liquor]] from 98&ndash;81 BCE, before it was returned to private production.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 43&ndash;44; Wagner (2001), 13&ndash;14.</ref> Although the Minister Steward and then the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed the [[Mint (coin)|imperial mint]] for issuing standard coins during Western Han, in Eastern Han the imperial mint was transferred to the office of the Minister of Finance.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1224; Bielenstein (1980), 47.</ref>

====Minister Steward====

When a [[Liu]]-family relative of an emperor<U+2014>usually a princely son<U+2014>was designated as his [[heir apparent]], he was provided living quarters within the palace and a personal staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 78"/> During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the heir apparent, known as the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000-''shi'') and Junior Tutor of the Heir Apparent (salary-rank unknown), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-''shi'').<ref name="bielenstein 1980 74 75">Bielenstein (1980), 74&ndash;75.</ref> During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-''shi''; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-''shi''.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 77 78"/> The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 77 78">Bielenstein (1980), 77&ndash;78.</ref> Other Western Han staff offices of the heir apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of the Hier Apparent.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 77 78"/> If he reached adulthood, the heir apparent could be married to a principle wife who led a harem of the heir apparent's concubines.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 77">Bielenstein (1980), 77.</ref>
 
The [[empress]], the legal wife of the emperor, also had an area of the palace separate from that of the emperor's private apartments,<ref name="bielenstein 1980 69">Bielenstein (1980), 69.</ref> where the empress was expected to spend every fifth night with the emperor.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 69"/> Both the empress and the heir apparent received an income from the taxes of forty counties.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 69 & 74.</ref> She also had a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-''shi''), along with many other subordinates, either male eunuchs or female maids, who took care of domestic needs.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 69 70">Bielenstein (1980), 69&ndash;70.</ref> The concubines of the harem were subordinates of the empress and were ranked below her in fourteen grades by the reign of [[Emperor Yuan of Han]] (r. 49&ndash;33).<ref>Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 75; Bielenstein (1980), 73&ndash;74.</ref> However, the founder of Eastern Han abolished the fourteen salary-ranks in favor of three ranks with no definite salary; instead, the concubines were irregularly granted gifts.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 73 74">Bielenstein (1980), 73&ndash;74.</ref> The chief concubine of Western Han, the Brilliant Companion, shared the same salary-rank as the Chancellor, while the concubine ranked just below her, the Favorite Beauty, shared the same salary-rank as any one of the Nine Ministers.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 73 74"/>

===Metropolitan offices===

The [[metropolitan area]]s of both Western Han [[Chang'an]] and Eastern Han [[Luoyang]] were governed and secured by several officials and officers. The county and municipal divisions of the capital cities were governed by a Prefect (''Ling'' <U+4EE4>). The Prefect was also responsible for a prison and could arrest officials of high rank.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1226">de Crespigny (2007), 1226.</ref> The Colonel of the City Gates (''Chengmen xiaowei'' <U+57CE><U+9580><U+6821><U+885B>) commanded the garrisons at the twelve city gates, each guarded by a captain, in both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 83 84">Bielenstein (1980), 83&ndash;84.</ref>

====Bearer of the Mace====
The Bearer of the Mace (''Zhi jinwu'' <U+57F7><U+91D1><U+543E>) was also known as the Bearer of the Gilded Mace. This official, whose title had been Commandant of the Capital (''Zhongwei'' <U+4E2D><U+5C09>) before 104 BCE, maintained law and order in the capital city<U+2014>excluding the imperial palaces<U+2014>in both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1225; Bielenstein (1980), 78.</ref> During Western Han, his salary-rank was Fully 2,000-''shi'', thus his prestige was similar to that of the Nine Ministers.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 78">Bielenstein (1980), 78.</ref> However, during Eastern Han his salary-rank was reduced from Fully 2,000-''shi'' to Equivalent to 2,000-''shi''.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1225; Bielenstein (1980), 79&ndash;80.</ref>

While his subordinates were on constant patrol, the Bearer of the Mace personally inspected the city three times each month.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 78"/> He was responsible for the military [[arsenal]] as well as disaster relief efforts during floods and fires.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 78"/> The Bearer of the Mace had a large staff of subordinates during Western Han, whose posts were abolished or transferred elsewhere during Eastern Han.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 79 80">Bielenstein (1980), 79&ndash;80.</ref> This included the abolition of the Captains of the Standard Bearers, and the emperor's entourage became responsible for clearing the roadways when the emperor left the palace and hoisting colored standards to signal his return.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 79 80"/>

====Court Architect====

The Court Architect (''Jiangzuo dajiang'' <U+5C07><U+4F5C><U+5C11><U+5E9C>) was in charge of the construction, maintenance, and repair of imperial palace halls, government halls, temples, grave tumuli, buildings in funerary parks, roads leading out of the capital, and [[flood control]] works.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1225; Bielenstein (1980), 80.</ref> His salary-rank was 2,000-''shi''.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 81">Bielenstein (1980), 81.</ref> He directed the efforts of conscripted [[corv<U+00E9>e]] laborers until this duty was transferred to the ministry of the newly created Excellency of Works in 8 BCE.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 80">Bielenstein (1980), 80.</ref> The Court Architect's subordinates were responsible for gathering timber for carpenters and stone for masons.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 81"/> Although his office existed at the establishment of Eastern Han, it was abolished in 57 CE and his duties were transferred to an Internuncio in the Ministry of the Household.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 81"/> However, the post was reinstated in 76 CE with the original salary-rank, yet many of his subordinates remained abolished.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 81"/> Since most buildings were constructed from wood, with ceramic roof tiles, a large workforce was needed to maintain buildings that fell into disrepair. The restoration of the Imperial University during [[Emperor Shun of Han|Emperor Shun's]] (r. 125&ndash;144 CE) reign required 100,000 laborers to work for a year under the supervision of the Court Architect.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1225">de Crespigny (2007), 1225.</ref>

====Colonel Director of Retainers====
{{see|History of the Han Dynasty}}
The Colonel Director of Retainers (''Sili xiaowei'' <U+53F8><U+96B8><U+6821><U+5C09>), also known as Colonel of Censure and Colonel Director of Convict-Laborers, was originally called the Director of Retainers (''Sili'' <U+53F8><U+96B8>). His task was to supervise 1,200 convicts in their construction of roads and canals.<ref name="wang 1949 156 157 bielenstein 1980 84 85">Wang (1949), 156&ndash;157; Bielenstein (1980), 84&ndash;85.</ref> In 91 BCE, an unsuccessful five-day rebellion in Chang'an was instigated by Crown Prince [[Liu Ju]] (d. 91 BCE) and his mother [[Empress Wei Zifu]] (d. 91 BCE), who had been accused of [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].<ref name="wang 1949 156 157 bielenstein 1980 84 85"/> For this event, Emperor Wu prefixed "colonel" to the Director of Retainers' title in 89 BCE, promoting him to the salary-rank 2,000-''shi'', and granted him the Staff of Authority, allowing him to arrest and punish those allegedly practicing witchcraft.<ref>Wang (1949), 156&ndash;157; Bielenstein (1980), 84&ndash;85; de Crespigny (2007), 1226.</ref>

Following the crisis, the Colonel Director of Retainers retained his privileged possession of the Staff of Authority and was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 84 85 wang 1949 157 158">Bielenstein (1980), 84&ndash;85; Wang (1949), 157&ndash;158.</ref> He routinely inspected the conduct of officials in the capital region and seven nearby commanderies. His investigative powers matched those of a provincial Inspector, although his Staff of Authority made him more powerful than the latter.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 84&ndash;85; de Crespigny (2007), 1226.</ref> The Colonel Director of Retainers was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 84 85 wang 1949 157 158"/> However, the Staff of Authority was removed from the Colonel in 45 BCE, limiting his powers to inspection, investigation, and [[impeachment]] and he was distinguished from a provincial Inspector only by a higher salary-rank.<ref>Wang (1949), 157&ndash;158; de Crespigny (2007), 1226; Bielenstein (1980), 85.</ref> The office of Colonel Director of Retainers was abolished in 9 BCE, and reinstated once more as the Director of Retainers in 7 BCE. He was now a subordinate of the new Excellency of Works and supervised convicts in public works projects, like his early Western Han counterpart.<ref>Wang (1949), 157&ndash;158; Bielenstein 1980 85.</ref> In Eastern Han, the Colonel Director of Retainers was reappointed without the Staff of Authority, with powers to inspect the capital region, but his salary-rank was reduced from 2000-''shi'' to Equivalent to 2000-''shi''.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 85; de Crespigny (2007), 1226.</ref>

The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks (''Shuiheng duwei'' <U+6C34><U+8861><U+90FD><U+5C09>) was also known as the Chief Commandant of Waterways and Parks, and was once a subordinate of the Minister Steward until 115 BCE, when he, and other former subordinates of that ministry, became independent officers.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 82">Bielenstein (1980), 82.</ref> His salary-rank was Equivalent to 2000-''shi''.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 82"/> The Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed a large imperial hunting park located outside Chang'an, including its palaces, rest stops, granaries, and cultivated patches of fruit and vegetable gardens which, along with [[Game (food)|game meat]], provided food for the emperor's household.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 82"/> He also collected taxes from commoners using the park's grounds and transmitted these funds to the Minister Steward, who managed the emperor's finances.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 82"/> One of the Superintendent's subordinates supervised convicted criminals in their care of the park's [[hunting dog]]s.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 83"/>

In 115 BCE the central government's [[Mint (coin)|mint]] was transferred from the Minister Steward's ministry to the park managed by the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 83"/> In 113 BCE the central government closed all commandery-level mints; private minting had  previously been outlawed in 144 BCE.<ref name="nishijima 1986 586 587"/> The Superintendent's imperial mint in the park outside Chang'an had the sole right to issue coinage throughout the empire.<ref>Loewe (1986), 162; Nishijima (1986), 587&ndash;588; Bielenstein (1980), 83.</ref> However, [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] (r. 25&ndash;57 CE) abolished the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks and revived his post annually during autumn to conduct a ritual sacrifice. The imperial mint became the responsibility of the Minister of Finance and the imperial park located outside Eastern-Han Luoyang was administered by a prefect.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 83">Bielenstein (1980), 83.</ref>

==Local government==
===Provincial authorities===

The Han Empire was divided by hierarchical political divisions in the following descending order: [[Zhou (country subdivision)|provinces]] (''zhou''), [[Commandery|commanderies]] (''jun''), and [[County (China)|counties]] (''xian'').<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1228">de Crespigny (2007), 1228.</ref> This model of local government was adopted from the previous government structure of the Qin Dynasty.<ref name="hucker 1975 152">Hucker (1975), 152.</ref>

A Han province consisted of a group of commanderies, the administrations of which were subject to scrutiny and inspection by centrally-appointed officials.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 90; Hucker (1975), 152.</ref> These were the Inspectors (''Cishi'' <U+523A><U+53F2>), also known as the Circuit Inspector, who were first appointed in 106 BCE at a salary-rank of 600-''shi''.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 90; de Crespigny (2007), 1228; Wang (1949), 158&ndash;159; Hucker (1975), 152.</ref> In Western Han they were supervised by the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and were subordinates of the Imperial Counselor.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 90; Wang (1949), 160; Hsu (1965), 363.</ref> Aside from the province-sized capital region which was entrusted to the Colonel Director of Retainers from 89&ndash;9 BCE, there were thirteen provinces during Western Han.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 90; Wang (1949), 158 159.</ref> Eventually, the title of Inspector was changed to Governor (''Mu'' <U+7267>; literally "Shepherd"), a post with a considerably higher salary-rank of 2,000-''shi''.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 90">Bielenstein (1980), 90.</ref> From 5&ndash;1 BCE, this post was reverted to Inspector, but was once again re-titled Governor, who  was now responsible to all Three Excellencies.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 90"/> 
[[File:China.Terracotta statues004.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Chinese jade|jade-carved]] [[door knocker]] decorated with [[Chinese dragon|dragons]], dated to the Western Han Era]]

During early Eastern Han, the loss of Han's control over the [[Ordos Desert]] prompted the Han court to reduce the provinces to twelve<U+2014>excluding the capital region<U+2014>in 35 CE.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 90 91">Bielenstein (1980), 90&ndash;91.</ref> In that year, the Inspectors-cum-Governors were still appointed by the central government, but their staffs were recruited from local administrations where they were transferred.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 91 92 de crespigny 2007 1228">Bielenstein (1980), 91&ndash;92; de Crespigny (2007), 1228.</ref> By 42 CE, the title Governor once more became  Inspector, who remained the head of provincial authorities until 188 CE.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 90 91 de crespigny 2007 1228"/> At an unknown date the Governors were reinstated, yet some of the provinces were still administered by Inspectors; this arrangement remained in place until the [[end of the Han Dynasty]] in 220 CE.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 90 91 de crespigny 2007 1228">de Crespigny (2007), 1228.</ref> A key difference between the roles was that an Inspector had no executive powers and only an advisory role, whereas a Governor could execute decisions on his own behalf.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1228"/> There were exceptions to this rule. If banditry or rebellion simultaneously arose in several commanderies under his jurisdiction at once, the Inspector was authorized to raise troops throughout all commanderies under his watch and lead this united force as commander to quell the disruption.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1228"/>

Both the Inspector and Governor were responsible for inspecting commandery-level Administrators and their staffs, as well as the semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 91; Wang (1949), 160.</ref> They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 91; Wang (1949), 159&ndash;160.</ref> These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 91">Bielenstein (1980), 91.</ref> The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 91"/>

===Commandery administration===
[[File:Eastern Han celadon pottery bottle.JPG|thumb|right|An Eastern-Han early [[celadon]] ceramic vase with lug handles and decorations of animalistic-faced (''[[taotie]]'') [[door knocker]]s]]

There were thirteen commanderies, including the capital region, and ten kingdoms at the beginning of Western Han. Many kingdoms were reduced in size and the empire's territory expanded through conquest. By 2 CE there were eighty-three commanderies and twenty kingdoms containing an aggregate total of approximately 58 million people according to the [[census]].<ref>Loewe (1968), 34&ndash;36; Loewe (1986), 122&ndash;123; Nishijima (1986), 595&ndash;596.</ref> A commandery consisted of a group of counties and was governed by an Administrator (''Taishou'' <U+592A><U+5B88>), also known as Grand Administrator, who was appointed by the central government and earned a 2,000-''shi'' salary-rank.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1228; Bielenstein (1980), 93.</ref> The Administrator was the civil and military leader of the commandery.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 93">Bielenstein (1980), 93.</ref> He was not allowed to govern over his native commandery.<ref name="hucker 1975 158">Hucker (1975), 158.</ref>

Many of the Administrators' duties were seasonal, such as inspections of counties every spring to check on local conditions like agriculture.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 96">Bielenstein (1980), 96.</ref> In the fall he sent subordinates into the counties to report whether local criminal lawsuits had been conducted fairly.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 96"/> He was responsible for recommending worthy nominees, known as [[Xiaolian|Filial and Incorrupt]], to the capital at the end each year during winter; the nominees would then be considered for an appointment to a central or local government office.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 96"/> This followed a system of quotas for each of the commanderies that was first established during Emperor Wu's reign, when two Filial and Incorrupt men from each commandery were sent to the capital.

In the nationwide census conducted in 2 CE, there were 1,587 counties listed.<ref name="loewe 1968 36">Loewe (1968), 36.</ref> The Han county was the smallest political division containing a centrally-appointed official.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1230 bielenstein 1980 100">de Crespigny (2007), 1230; Bielenstein 1980 100.</ref> In larger counties of about 10,000 households he was known as the Prefect (''Ling'' <U+4EE4>); in smaller counties he was known as the Chief (''Zhang'' <U+9577>).<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1230 bielenstein 1980 100"/> Depending on the size of the county, the Prefect's salary-rank was 600-''shi'' or 1,000-''shi'', while a Chief was ranked at 300-''shi'' or 500-''shi''.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1230 bielenstein 1980 100"/> Due to their judicial role, historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] does not differentiate between Prefects and Chiefs, referring to both as [[Magistrate]]s.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1230">de Crespigny (2007), 1230.</ref> The county's head civil servants, usually respected scholars or elders in their local communities, were appointed directly by the Magistrate.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1230"/>

A county Magistrate was in charge of maintaining law and order, storing grain in case of famine, registering the populace for taxation, mobilizing conscripted commoners for corv<U+00E9>e labor projects, supervising public works, renovating schools, and performing rituals.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 100">Bielenstein (1980), 100.</ref> They were also given the duty to act as judge for all lawsuits brought to the county court.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 100"/> The judicial jurisdictions of the commandery Administrator and county Magistrate overlapped, so it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first would try him or her.<ref>Hulsew<U+00E9> (1986), 528.</ref> Under Emperor Wu,  commanderies and kingdoms operated public schools, and although counties could operate their own public schools, not all of them did.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 101">Bielenstein (1980), 101.</ref>

The county was further divided into [[District (China)|districts]],<ref>Nishijima (1986), 551&ndash;552; Bielenstein (1980), 103.</ref> each consisting of at least several [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] grouped together; typically a community of approximately one hundred families.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 551&ndash;552; Bielenstein 1980 103.</ref> A [[chief of police]] was assigned to each district by the county Magistrate.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 552&ndash;553.</ref> A county Magistrate heavily relied on the cooperation of local elders and leaders at the district level; these carried out much of the day-to-day affairs of arbitrating disputes in their communities, collecting taxes, and fighting crime.<ref>Hsu (1965), 365.</ref>

===Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses===
{{see|History of the Han Dynasty|Society and culture of the Han Dynasty}}
[[File:ChangXingongdeng.jpg|thumb|A gilt-bronze [[oil lamp]] in the shape of a kneeling female servant wearing [[Han Chinese clothing|silk robes]], dated to the Western Han Era]]

A [[Kings of the Han Dynasty|Han kingdom]] was much like a commandery in size and administration, except it was officially, and after 145 BCE, nominally, the [[fief]] of a relative to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons<U+2014>excluding the heir apparent.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1219 & 1229.</ref> The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] (r. 202&ndash;195 BCE), as many of the early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the [[Chu-Han contention]] (206&ndash;202 BCE).<ref name="bielenstein 1980 105">Bielenstein (1980), 105.</ref> Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his [[Queen consort|queen]].<ref name="bielenstein 1980 105"/> 

The number of kingdoms fluctuated between Western and Eastern Han, but there were never fewer than eight nor greater than twenty-five.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 105"/> In the early Western Han, the kingdoms accounted for approximately two-thirds of the empire. The imperial court ruled over the commanderies located in the western third of the empire, while kings ruled their fiefs with little or no central government intervention.<ref>Wang (1949), 135; Loewe (1986), 122&ndash;128.</ref> The administrative staffs of each kingdom paralleled the model of central government, as each kingdom had a Grand Tutor (ranked 2000-''shi''), Chancellor (2,000-''shi''), and Imperial Secretary (2,000-''shi''). No kingdom was allowed to have a Grand Commandant, since they were not allowed to initiate war campaigns on their own behalf.<ref>Wang (1949), 135; Bielenstein (1980), 105; Loewe (1986), 126; Hsu (1965), 360.</ref> Although the kingdoms' Chancellors were appointed by the imperial court, the king had the right to appoint all other officials in his fief.<ref>Hsu (1965), 360; Bielenstein (1980), 106.</ref> 

The power of the kings declined after the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] in 154 BCE; the number of kingdoms and their sizes were reduced.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 106; Wang (1949), 135.</ref> An imperial edict in 145 BCE removed the kings' rights to appoint officials above the salary-rank of 400-''shi'', and all officials ranked higher than this were appointed directly by the central government.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 106">Bielenstein (1980), 106.</ref> Excluding the kingdom-level Minister Coachman, the kingdoms' Nine Ministers and Imperial Counselors were abolished. The Chancellor, now the equivalent of a commandery Administrator, was retained, although he was still appointed by the central government.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 106 107">Bielenstein (1980), 106&ndash;107.</ref> After these reforms, the kings were no longer administrative heads and merely took a portion of the taxes collected by the government in their kingdoms as personal income.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 106&ndash;107; Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 76.</ref> [[Charles Hucker]] notes that after this transformation of kingdoms and marquessates into virtual commanderies and counties, respectively, a "...&nbsp;fully centralized government was achieved" for the first time since the Qin Dynasty.<ref name="hucker 1975 152"/>

[[File:Painted figures on a lacquer basket, Eastern Han Dynasty2.jpg|thumb|left|Paragons of filial piety, Chinese painted artwork on a [[Lacquerware|lacquered]] basketwork box excavated from an Eastern-Han tomb of what was the Chinese [[Lelang Commandery]] in modern [[North Korea]].]]

Han society below the level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain privileges such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a [[marquess]] and the twentieth being a full marquess<U+2014>the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate (''houguo'' <U+4FAF><U+570B>)<U+2014>typically the size of a county.<ref>Ch'<U+00FC> (1972), 16; Bielenstein (1980), 108; de Crespigny (2007), 1219.</ref> If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, they were considered commoners.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 105"/> However, this rule was changed in 127 BCE so that all the kings' sons were made full marquesses.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 105"/> It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BCE, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 108">Bielenstein (1980), 108.</ref> The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 108"/> His Chancellor was the equivalent of a county Prefect.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 108; de Crespigny (2007) 1230.</ref>

The emperor's sisters and daughters were made either senior [[princess]]es, who shared the same rank as kings, or princesses, who shared the same rank as full marquesses; a princess's fief was typically the size of a county.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 107 de crespigny 2007 1220 1221">Bielenstein (1980), 107; de Crespigny (2007), 1220&ndash;1221.</ref> The husband of a princess was ranked as a marquess.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1220 1221">de Crespigny (2007), 1220&ndash;1221.</ref> The daughters of kings were also princesses, but their fiefs were typically the smaller size of county districts, and could not be inherited by sons.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 107 de crespigny 2007 1220 1221"/> Unlike the fiefs of kings and marquesses, the staffs of the princesses' fiefs answered directly to one of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 107">Bielenstein (1980), 107.</ref>

===Conscripted soldiers and militias===
{{see|Society and culture of the Han Dynasty}}

Upon reaching the age of twenty-three, male commoners became eligible for [[conscription]] into the armed forces (''zhengzu'' <U+6B63><U+5352>) for one year of training and one year of service; the year of service could be served until the age of fifty-six.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114 nishijima 1986 599 hucker 1975 166">Bielenstein (1980), 114; Nishijima (1986), 599; Hucker (1975), 166.</ref> Coscripts were trained, and would serve in one of three branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or naval marine.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114 nishijima 1986 599">Bielenstein (1980), 114; Nishijima (1986), 599.</ref> The year of service could take the form of soldiering at frontier garrisons protecting the borders against nomadic enemies, serving as guards in the courts of kings or as guards under the Minister of the Guards in the capital.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114 nishijima 1986 599 hucker 1975 166"/> By 155 BCE, the minimum age for conscription was lowered to twenty.<ref name="chang 2007 70 71">Chang (2007), 70&ndash;71.</ref> During [[Emperor Zhao of Han]]'s (r. 87&ndash;74 BCE) reign, the minimum age was raised to twenty-three, but after his reign it was once again reduced to twenty.<ref name="chang 2007 70 71"/>
[[File:China.Terracotta statues033.jpg|thumb|left|Western-Han ceramic figurines of cavalrymen on horseback]] 

Although this system of conscription survived into Eastern Han, conscription could be avoided upon payment of a commutable tax.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 564 565 1234 hucker 1975 166">de Crespigny (2007), 564&ndash;565 & 1234; Hucker (1975), 166.</ref> 

The government also exempted those who presented authorities with a slave, a horse, or grain.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114">Bielenstein (1980), 114.</ref> In the system of twenty ranks bestowed on commoners and nobles alike, those of the ninth rank and above were exempt from military service.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114"/> To compensate for the loss of manpower, the Eastern Han government favored the recruitment of a largely [[volunteer army]].<ref name="de crespigny 2007 564 565 1234 hucker 1975 166"/> Many other soldiers in Eastern Han were convicted criminals who commuted their sentences by joining the army.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1234">de Crespigny (2007), 1234.</ref> [[Mercenary|Mercenaries]] eventually comprised much of the capital guard, while foreign nomadic tribes were often employed to guard the frontiers.<ref name="hucker 1975 167">Hucker (1975), 167.</ref>

After their year of active service, Western Han-era soldiers were demobilized and sent home, where they were obligated to join the local [[militia]] that convened every eighth month of the year.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114"/> This obligation was intended to curb local and regional [[Warlord|warlordism]] that nonetheless became prevalent by the end of Han.<ref>Hucker (1975), 166.</ref> Militias dismissed members who reached the age of fifty-six.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114"/> By Eastern Han, the obligation upon retired soldiers to join local militias was removed.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114"/>

===Standing army and army reserves===
[[File:Han Tomb Mural, Horses and Carts.jpg|thumb|Carts and horses going out, 137cm x 201 cm, Eastern Han Dynasty; one of 57 murals from the Nei Menggu Helingeer (or Holingor) Tomb in [[Inner Mongolia]] belonging to a prominent official, landowner, and colonel of the Wuhuan Army]]

The non-professional conscripted soldiers who served a one-year term under the Minister of the Guards belonged to the Southern Army (''Nanjun'' <U+5357><U+8ECD>).<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114 115">Bielenstein (1980), 114&ndash;115.</ref> Non-conscripted, professional soldiers belonged to a [[standing army]] known as the Northern Army (''Beijun'' <U+5317><U+8ECD>).<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114 115"/> The Northern Army's main purpose was to defend the capital, but it was sometimes required to repel foreign invasions.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 118">Bielenstein (1980), 118.</ref> The Northern Army is first mentioned in Han records in about 180 BCE, yet little is known of its command structure at that time.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114 115"/> Several decades later, Emperor Wu reformed the Northern Army's [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] so that its command was shared by five Colonels (''Xiaowei'' <U+6821><U+5C09>) who each ranked 2,000-''shi'' and commanded a regiment.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 114 115"/> Emperor Wu also appointed three other Colonels, ranked 2,000-''shi'', whose forces were considered an extension of the Northern Army yet were stationed far outside the capital at strategic passes.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 115">Bielenstein (1980), 115.</ref> Each of the eight Colonels was assisted by a Major (''Sima'' <U+53F8><U+99AC>) who was ranked at 1,000-''shi''.<ref>Nishijima (1986), 600&ndash;601; de Crespigny (2007), 1234.</ref> Professional soldiers could also be found in [[Tuntian|agricultural garrisons]] established in the [[Western Regions]], such as those led by the Wu and Ji Colonels (''Wuji xiaowei'' <U+620A><U+5DF1><U+6821><U+5C09>, who were ranked Equivalent to 600-''shi'' and were based at the [[Turfan]] oasis.<ref>Bielenstein (1980), 110 & 116.</ref> 

During Eastern Han, the conscripted army under the Minister of the Guards was no longer referred to as the Southern Army. The Northern Army was retained, although it was reformed so that there were five Colonels instead of eight.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1234; Bielenstein (1980), 117.</ref> The Eastern Han-era Colonels of the Northern Army were also demoted to the rank of Equivalent to 2,000-''shi''.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1234 bielenstein 1980 117 118">de Crespigny (2007), 1234; Bielenstein (1980), 117&ndash;118.</ref>

According to Eastern Han-era sources, the Northern Army was a relatively small fighting force of between 3,500 and 4,200 professional soldiers, each regiment consisting of approximately 750 soldiers and 150 junior officers.<ref name="de crespigny 2007 1234 bielenstein 1980 117 118"/> To aid this force, Emperor Guangwu established a 1,000-soldier unit of [[army reserves]] in Liyang County along the Yellow River in 43 CE, while two other reserve units were created in 110 CE; these were headed by a Commandant (the same title used for the commandery-level military officer).<ref name="bielenstein 1980 118">Bielenstein (1980), 118.</ref> The main purpose of these reserve units was to position Han troops at strategic passes to guard the lower [[Wei River]] against Xiongnu, [[Wuhuan]], and [[Tibet]]an tribes.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 118 119">Bielenstein (1980), 118&ndash;119</ref>

===Wartime militia and officers===

During peacetime and war, the command structure of the Northern Army remained the same.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 116">Bielenstein (1980), 116.</ref> However, during times of great conflict and crisis, the raising of large militias required the appointment of many new officers with various titles, which were often bestowed as honorary titles to officials during times of peace.<ref>de Crespigny (2007), 1233; Bielenstein (1980), 116 & 121&ndash;122.</ref> Large [[Division (military)|divisions]] were led by a General (''Jiangjun'' <U+5C07><U+8ECD>) whose rank depended on status; divisions were divided into a number of [[regiment]]s commanded by a Colonel, and sometimes by a Major.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 120 121 de crespigny 2007 1234">Bielenstein (1980), 120&ndash;121; de Crespigny (2007), 1234.</ref> Regiments were divided into [[Company (military unit)|companies]] and led by Captains, who ranked Equivalent to 2,000-''shi'', while companies were further divided into [[platoon]]s.<ref name="bielenstein 1980 120 121 de crespigny 2007 1234"/>
