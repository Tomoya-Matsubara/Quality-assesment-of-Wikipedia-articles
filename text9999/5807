'''John of Tours''' (or '''John de Villula''') (died 1122) was a medieval [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Bishop of Wells]] in England who moved the diocese seat to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. He was a native of Tours and was King [[William I of England]]'s doctor before becoming a bishop. After his consecration as bishop, he was either given or purchased [[Bath Abbey]], a rich monastery, and then moved the headquarters of the diocese from Wells, to the abbey. He rebuilt the church at Bath, building a large cathedral that no longer survives. He gave a large library to his cathedral and received the right to hold a fair in Bath. Not noted for his scholarship, he died suddenly in 1122.

==Early life==

A native of [[Tours]],<ref name=Cantor36>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 36</ref> John was a Norman-French physician<ref name=Smith132>Smith "John of Tours" ''Downside Review'' p. 132<U+2013>133</ref> to King [[William I of England]], being present at the king's deathbed in 1087.<ref>[[Frank Barlow (historian)|Barlow, Frank]], ''William Rufus'' p.45.</ref> [[William of Malmesbury]], the medieval chronicler, called him "a very skilled doctor, not in theoretical knowledge, but in practice."<ref name=Bartlett589>quoted in Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 589</ref> He had been a priest of Tours before becoming doctor to King William.<ref name=DNB>Ramsey "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14846  Tours, John of (d. 1122)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> He seems to have learned his medical skills not in a school, but was considered a skilled doctor.<ref name=Church66/> The name "de Villula" first appears in 1691, and is not a contemporary name.<ref name=BHOBath/> It resulted from a misreading of John's name in his episcopal profession.<ref name=DNB/>

==Bishop of Bath==
[[File:Investiturewoodcut.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A woodcut illustration of [[Investiture]], or the ceremonial granting of the symbols of an ecclesiastical office, by a king. From ''Mediaeval and Modern History'' by Philip Van Ness Myers, 1905.]]
John was appointed Bishop of Wells in 1088 by [[William II of England|King William II]], the son and successor to William I. The bishop's consecration was in July,<ref name=Handbook227>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 227</ref> at [[Canterbury]] by Archbishop [[Lanfranc]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=Smith132/> He probably owed his appointment to the king's desire to honour his father's physician.<ref name=Church66/>

Shortly after his consecration, John bought [[Bath Abbey]]'s grounds from the king,<ref>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p.182.</ref> as well as the city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the town or whether he was given the town as a gift by the king is unclear.<ref name=DNB/> The abbey had recently lost its abbot Alfsige, and was according to [[Domesday Book]] the owner of large estates in and near the town. It would have been the wealth of the abbey that attracted John to take over the monastery.<ref name=Smith134>Smith "John of Tours" ''Downside Review'' p. 134<U+2013>135</ref> By acquiring the town of Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the town.<ref name=Mason130>Mason ''William II'' p. 130</ref> In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey,<ref name=Handbook227/><ref name=Huscroft128>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 128</ref> probably as an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues.<ref name=Williams136>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 136</ref>  William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns.<ref name=DNB/> When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his [[cathedral chapter]], turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the [[Canon (priest)|canon]]s located at Wells that had previously served the diocese.<ref name=Monastic132>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 132</ref>

John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of [[Robert de Mowbray]]'s rebellions. As rebuilt, it was only surpassed in size by the cathedrals at Ely, Norwich and Winchester. The present [[Bath Abbey|Bath Cathedral]] is not the building that John built, and occupies only a fraction of the space that John's building encompassed.<ref name=Smith136>Smith "John of Tours" ''Downside Review'' p. 136<U+2013>137</ref> He also reformed the administration of his diocese, setting up [[archdeacon]]s and organizing a court for hearing ecclesiastical cases.<ref name=Smith138>Smith "John of Tours" ''Downside Review'' p. 138<U+2013>139</ref> His efforts to reform his diocese led to his cathedral chapter's complaining of their treatment, which John seems to have ignored.<ref name=Brett8>Brett ''English Church'' p. 8</ref> At Wells, he was accused of destroying the community of canons there, which had been created by his predecessor.<ref name=Church66/>

In 1092 he helped with the consecration of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], and in 1094 performed the same service for [[Battle Abbey]].<ref name=Smith140>Smith "John of Tours" ''Downside Review'' p. 140<U+2013>141</ref> After the accession of King [[Henry I of England]], John received a confirmation of the grant of the city of Bath, paying 500 pounds of silver for the verification.<ref name=VCH>Page (ed.) ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40919 A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 2: Houses of Benedictine monks: The Cathedral Priory of Bath]''</ref> In 1102, John secured from King Henry the right to hold fairs at Bath on the feast day of the cathedral's patron saint, [[Saint Peter]].<ref name=Smith134/> He gave an extensive library to the cathedral at Bath, and eventually the monks there became reconciled to him. John, however, continued to hold most of the old abbey's manors himself, rather than using them for the support of the monks.<ref name=Church66/>

== Investiture Controversy ==
John was one of the bishops that sided with King William against [[Anselm of Canterbury]] at the king's [[Whitsun]] council in 1097,<ref name=Vaughn201>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Rober of Meulan'' p. 201</ref> one of early councils called during the [[Investiture Controversy]] in England. During the reign of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], who succeeded his brother King William in 1100, John along with [[Robert Bloet]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], consecrated abbots who had been [[investiture|invested]] in office by the king.<ref name=Vaughn248>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' p. 248<U+2013>249</ref> John attended Anselm's reforming [[Council of London (1102)|Council of London]] in 1102, which debated and passed decrees to reform the clergy.<ref name=Smith140/>

==Death and legacy==

John died in December 1122<ref name=Handbook227/> and was buried in Bath Cathedral.<ref name=BHOBath>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34341 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 7: Bath and Wells:Bishops]''</ref> He suffered a heart attack after dinner and died suddenly.<ref name=Church263>Barlow ''English Church'' p. 263</ref> Traditionally the date of his death is given as 29 December.<ref name=VCH/>

Under John, the monks of Bath became known for their scholarship, although he was not particularly noted for learning.<ref name=DNB/> William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the canons of Wells abominably.<ref name=Smith136/> William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived to be old.<ref name=Church66>Barlow ''English Church'' pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> At first he treated the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them.<ref name=Smith136/> John's [[Canon (priest)|canon]]s of Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings as part of the movement of the see to Bath.<ref name=DNB/> A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office.<ref name=Brett178>Brett ''English Church'' p. 178</ref> John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert.<ref name=DNB/> Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.<ref name=BHOArchBath>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34350 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 7: Bath and Wells: Archdeacons without Territorial Title]''</ref>
