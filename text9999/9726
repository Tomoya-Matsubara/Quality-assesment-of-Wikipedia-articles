Long was honored in 2005 at the ''Trumpet Awards'' for his leadership, dedication and service around the world.

==Theology==
Long's sermons, writings and teachings emphasize a "chain of command" <ref name="Watch this!">{{cite book|title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=3-f3bb12kaEC&pg=PR2&dq=%22Watch+this!:+the+ethics+and+aesthetics+of+black+televangelism%22&hl=en&ei=GQO6TI3xBcKB8gaJnMTADg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=eddie%20long&f=true Watch this!

A woman  chooses to be respectful, submissive and obedient to her father or husband. To live otherwise is to be outside of the divinely established order, and will result in the loss of spiritual and natural benefits.<ref name = "Watch this!" />
