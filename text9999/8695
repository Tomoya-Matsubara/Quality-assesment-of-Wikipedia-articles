'''New media art''' is a genre that encompasses artworks created with [[new media]] [[technology|technologies]], including [[digital art]], [[computer graphics]], [[computer animation]], [[virtual art]], [[Internet art]], [[interactive art]], [[video games]], [[computer]] [[robotics]], and art as [[biotechnology]]. The term differentiates itself by its resulting cultural objects and social events, which can be seen in opposition to those deriving from old visual arts (i.e. traditional [[painting]], sculpture, etc.). This concern with medium is a key feature of much [[contemporary art]] and indeed many art schools and major Universities now offer majors in "New Genres" or "New Media"<ref>[http://www.academyart.edu/computer-arts-school/outline.html "Academy of Art New Media Degree"]</ref> and a growing number of graduate programs have emerged internationally.<ref>[http://artexetra.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/shanken_art_industry_academy.pdf Shanken, Edward A. "Artists in Industry and the Academy: Collaborative Research, Interdisciplinary Scholarship, and the Creation and Interpretation of Hybrid Forms,<U+201D> Leonardo 38:5 (2005): 415-18.]</ref> New Media Art often involves interaction between artist and observer or between observers and the artwork, which responds to them. Yet, as several theorists and curators have noted, such forms of interaction, social exchange, participation, and transformation do not distinguish new media art but rather serve as a common ground that has parallels in other strands of contemporary art practice.<ref>[http://hybridge.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/writings-media/ Shanken, Edward "Contemporary Art and New Media: Toward a Hybrid Discourse?" (2011); Quaranta, Domenico, "Postmedia Perspective" (2011); Graham, Beryl and Sarah Cook, Rethinking Curating (2010).]</ref> Such insights emphasize the forms of cultural practice that arise concurrently with emerging technological platforms, and question the focus on technological media, per se.

New Media concerns are often derived from the [[telecommunications]], [[mass media]] and [[Digital electronics|digital electronic]] modes of delivering the artworks involve, with practices ranging from [[conceptual art|conceptual]] to [[Internet Art|virtual art]], [[performance]] to [[Installation art|installation]].

== History ==
The origins of new media art can be traced to the moving photographic inventions of the late 19th century such as the [[zoetrope]] (1834), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877) and [[Eadweard Muybridge|Eadweard Muybridge's]] [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879). From the 1920s through the 1950s, various forms of kinetic and light art, from [[Thomas Wilfred]]'s 'Lumia' (1919) and 'Clavilux' light organs to [[Jean Tinguely]]'s self-destructing sculpture 'Homage to New York' (1960) can be seen as progenitors of new media art.

In 1958 [[Wolf Vostell]] becomes the first artist who incorporates a television set into one of his works. <U+201E>Deutscher Ausblick<U+201C>/<U+201E>German View<U+201C>-<U+201E>Black Room Cycle<U+201C>,<ref>[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/deutscher-ausblick/ Wolf Vostell, <U+201E>Deutscher Ausblick<U+201C>/<U+201E>German View<U+201C>-<U+201E>Black Room Cycle<U+201C> 1958]</ref> Environment, 1958, is part of the collection of the [[Berlinische Galerie]].
During the 1960s the development of then new technologies of video produced the new media art experiments of [[Nam June Paik]], and [[Wolf Vostell]] with the [[Installation art|installation]] <U+201E>6 TV De-coll/age<U+201C>, 1963,<ref>[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/ Wolf Vostell <U+201C>6 TV De-coll/age<U+201C> 1963]</ref> [[A. Michael Noll]], and [[multimedia]] [[performance]]s of [[E.A.T.]], [[Fluxus]] and [[Happening]]. The development of computer graphics at the end of the 1980s and real time technologies then in the 1990s combined with the spreading of the Web and the Internet favored the emergence of new and various forms of interactivity art by [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]], [[David Rokeby]], [[Perry Hoberman]]; [[telematic art]] by [[Roy Ascott]]; Internet art by [[Vuk <U+0106>osi<U+0107>]], [[Jodi]]; virtual and immersive art by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], [[Maurice Benayoun]] and large scale urban installation by [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]].
[[File:WORLD SKIN (3).jpg|thumb|200px|World Skin (1997), [[Maurice Benayoun]]'s Virtual Reality Interactive Installation]]
Simultaneously advances in biotechnology have also allowed artists like [[Eduardo Kac]] to begin exploring DNA and genetics as a new art medium.

New Media Art influences on new media art have been the theories developed around [[hypertext]], databases, and [[computer network|networks]]. Important thinkers in this regard have been [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Theodor Nelson]], whereas comparable ideas can be found in the literary works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Italo Calvino]], and [[Julio Cort<U+00E1>zar]]. These elements have been especially revolutionary for the field of narrative and anti-narrative studies, leading explorations into areas such as non-linear and interactive narratives. A contemporary timeline of media art can be found here.<ref>Hoetzlein, 2009. [http://www.rchoetzlein.com/theory/?p=42 Timeline of 20th c. Art and Media]</ref>

In the book ''New Media Art'', [[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana named several themes that contemporary new media art addresses, including [[computer art]], [[collaboration]], [[Personal identity|identity]], [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Open source|open sourcing]], [[telepresence]], surveillance, corporate parody, as well as intervention and [[hacktivism]].<ref>{{citation

}}</ref> [[Maurizio Bolognini]] suggested that new media artists have one common denominator, which is a self-referential relationship with the new technologies, the result of finding oneself inside an epoch-making transformation determined by technological development. Nevertheless new media art does not appear as a set of homogeneous practices, but as a complex field converging around three main elements: 1) the art system, 2) scientific and industrial research, and 3) political-cultural media activism. There are significant differences between scientist-artists, activist-artists and technological artists closer to the art system, who not only do have different training and technocultures, but have different artistic production.<ref>See also [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris, 2010.</ref> This should be taken into account in examining the several themes addressed by new media art.

Non-linearity can be seen as an important topic to new media art by artists like [[Bill Viola]] who explores the term as an approach to looking at varying forms of digital projects. This is a key concept since people acquired the notion that they were conditioned to view everything in a linear and clear-cut fashion.  Now, art is stepping out of that form and allowing for people to build their own experiences with the piece.  People always ask, "What is the difference between non-linearity and randomness?" Non-linearity describes a project that has freedom with certain parameters, whereas randomness has freedom and no boundaries whatsoever. Non-linear art usually requires audience participation to reveal its non-linearity while random art, more-or-less, acts on its own. In doing so, viewers can understand another theme in the many forms of new media art. The participatory aspect of new media art, which for some artists has become integral, emerged from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s ''Happenings''.

The inter-connectivity and interactivity of the [[internet]], as well as the fight between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web today, fascinate and inspire a lot of current new media art.

Many new media art projects also work with themes like politics and social consciousness, allowing for [[social activism]] through the interactive nature of the media.

One of the key themes in new media art is to create visual views of databases. Pioneers in this area include [[Lisa Strausfeld]] and [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]].<ref>
{{cite book|last1=Bulajic|first1=Viktorija Vesna|
title=Database aesthetics: art in the age of information overflow|publisher=University of Minnesota
Press|year=2007|url=|isbn=}}
</ref> Database aesthetics holds at least two attractions to new media artists: formally, as a new variation on non-linear narratives; and politically as a means to subvert what is fast becoming a form of control and authority.

==Presentation and preservation==
As the technologies used to deliver works of new media art such as [[photographic film|film]], [[cassette tape|tapes]], [[web browser]]s, [[software]] and [[operating system]]s become obsolete, New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to [[Art conservation and restoration|preserve artwork]] beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects into [[New media art preservation]] are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile media arts heritage (see [[Docam|DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage]]).

Methods of preservation exist, including the translation of a work from an obsolete medium into a related new medium,<ref>[http://www.ercim.org/publication/ws-proceedings/DELOS6/rosetta.pdf Digital Rosetta Stone]</ref> the digital archiving of media (see [[Internet Archive]]), and the use of [[emulators]] to preserve work dependent on obsolete software or operating system environments.<ref>[http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm Preserving the Rhizome ArtBase], a report by [[Richard Rinehart]] for [http://rhizome.org Rhizome.org]</ref><ref>[http://netzspannung.org/media-art/topics/cultural-heritage/?lang=en Cultural Heritage as a Mediation of Digital Culture], a report by [[Nina Zschocke; Gabriele Blome; Monika Fleischmann]] for [http://netzspannung.org/index_en_flash.html netzspannung.org]</ref>

==Education==
In New Media programs, students are able to get acquainted with the newest forms of creation and communication. New Media students learn to identify what is or isn't "new" about certain technologies.<ref name="illinois.edu">[[New Media Faculty]], (2011). "New Media", University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. [http://www.art.illinois.edu/content/undergraduate/programs/new-media/].</ref> Science and the market will always present new tools and platforms for artists and designers. Students learn how to sort through new emerging technological platforms and place them in a larger context of sensation, communication, production, and consumption. 

When obtaining a Bachelor's degree in New Media students will primarily work through practice of building experiences that utilize new and old technologies and narrative. Through the construction of projects in various media, they acquire technical skills, practice vocabularies of critique and analysis, and gain familiarity with historical and contemporary precedents. <ref name="illinois.edu" />
