'''Comet Hale-Bopp''' ([[Astronomical naming conventions#Comets|formally designated]] '''C/1995&nbsp;O1''') was arguably the most widely observed [[comet]] of the twentieth century, and one of the brightest seen for many [[decade]]s. It was visible to the [[naked eye]] for a record 18&nbsp;months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the [[Great Comet of 1811]].

Hale-Bopp was discovered on July 23, 1995 at a great distance from the [[Sun]], raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it passed close to Earth. Although predicting the brightness of comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult, Hale-Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed [[perihelion]] on April 1, 1997. The comet was dubbed the [[Great comet|Great Comet]] of 1997.

The passage of Hale-Bopp was notable also for inciting a degree of comet-related [[panic]] not seen for decades. Rumours that an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[spacecraft]] was following the comet gained remarkable currency, and inspired a [[mass suicide]] among followers of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] [[cult]].

== Discovery ==
The comet was discovered by two independent observers, [[Alan Hale (astronomer)|Alan Hale]] and [[Thomas Bopp]], both in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = The comets of 1995 | last = Shanklin |first = Jonathan D. | journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association | year= 2000 | volume =110 |issue = 6 |pages= 311 |url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2000JBAA..110..311S/0000311.000.html}}</ref> Hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in [[New Mexico]] when he chanced upon Hale-Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an [[apparent magnitude]] of 10.5 and lay near the [[globular cluster]] [[Globular Cluster M70|M70]] in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].<ref name="Circ6187" /> Hale first established that there was no other [[deep-sky object]] near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he [[email]]ed the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]], the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.<ref name="TimeDiscovery">{{cite news|title=Comet of the decade Part II| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986055,00.html | work = Time | date=March 17, 1997 | first = Michael D. | last = Lemonick | accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

Bopp did not own a [[telescope]]. He was out with friends near [[Stanfield, Arizona]] observing star clusters and [[galaxy|galaxies]] when he chanced across the comet while at the eyepiece of his friend's telescope. He realized he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects were known to be near M70, and found that there were none. He alerted the Central Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams, and, the following morning, it was confirmed that this was a new comet, and it was named Comet Hale-Bopp, with the designation C/1995&nbsp;O1. The discovery was announced in [[International Astronomical Union]] circular 6187.<ref name="Circ6187">{{cite web|last=Hale|first=A.|coauthors= Bopp, T.; Stevens, J.|title=IAU Circular No. 6187|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |date=July 23, 1995|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iauc/06100/06187.html#Item1|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Amateur Contributions in the study of Comet Hale-Bopp | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume =79 | issue = 1<U+2013>3 | year = 1997 | pages = 307<U+2013>308 | first =Thomas | last =Bopp | doi = 10.1023/A:1006262006364}}</ref>

== Early observation ==
Hale-Bopp's orbital position was calculated as 7.2&nbsp;[[astronomical units]] (AU) from the Sun, placing it between [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] and by far the greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/mpec/J95/J95P01.html | last=Marsden | first= B.

Its great distance and surprising activity indicated that Comet Hale-Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary <U+2013> comets can be extremely unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at great distance only to diminish in brightness later. [[Comet Kohoutek]] in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and turned out to be unspectacular.<ref name="TimeDiscovery"/>

== Perihelion ==
Hale-Bopp became visible to the [[naked eye]] in May 1996, and although its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year,<ref name="Kidger2004"/> scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too close to the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with [[light pollution|light-polluted]] skies.<ref>{{cite news|title = Comet Holds Clues to Birth of Time | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E6DF1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 | last = Browne | first = Malcolm R. | date = March 9, 1997 | work = The New York Times}}</ref>
[[File:Comet-Hale-Bopp-29-03-1997 hires adj.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The comet became a spectacular sight in early 1997.]]

The [[internet]] was a growing phenomenon at the time, and numerous websites that tracked the comet's progress and provided daily images from around the world became extremely popular. The internet played a large role in encouraging the unprecedented public interest in comet Hale-Bopp.<ref>{{cite web| title= The Trail of Hale-Bopp | url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-trail-of-hale-bopp | work= Scientific American | date= 1997-03-17 | accessdate =2008-10-23}}</ref>

As the comet approached the Sun, it continued to brighten, shining at 2nd&nbsp;magnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit. On March 9, a [[solar eclipse]] in [[China]], [[Mongolia]] and eastern [[Siberia]] allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime.<ref>{{cite journal |title = The total solar eclipse of 1997 March 9 | last = McGee | first= H.

As it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997 the comet developed into a spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except [[Sirius]], and its dust tail stretched 40<U+2013>45 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] across the sky.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eso.org/public/events/astro-evt/hale-bopp/comet-hale-bopp-summary-apr13-97-rw.html | title = Comet Hale-Bopp (April 13, 1997) | accessdate=2008-11-23 | last = West | first = Richard M. | authorlink = Richard Martin West | date = April 13, 1997 | publisher=European Southern Observatory}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | first=B.

As impressive as the comet was, it could have been much more so.  Had it passed as close to Earth as [[Comet Hyakutake]] (C/1996 B2) did in 1996 (0.1&nbsp;AU),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/ | title=Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake | accessdate=November 27, 2008 | publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory }}</ref> the comet's tail would have spanned the entire sky and it would have been brighter than the full [[moon]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Marcano | first=Tony | title=A Shadow on the Moon Plus a New Star at Night | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E5DC103BF937A15750C0A961958260 | accessdate=November 27, 2008 | work=The New York Times | date = March 24, 1997}}</ref>

== After perihelion ==
After its perihelion passage, the comet moved into the southern celestial hemisphere, and its show was over as far as most of the northern hemisphere public were concerned. The comet was much less impressive to [[southern hemisphere]] observers than it had been in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569&nbsp;days, or about 18 and a half months.<ref name="Kidger2004">{{cite journal | last = Kidger| first = M.R. | coauthors = Hurst, G; James, N. | year=2004 | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 78 | issue=1<U+2013>3 | pages = 169<U+2013>177 | title = The Visual Light Curve Of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) From Discovery To Late 1997 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/h72381014307x661/ | doi=10.1023/A:1006228113533}}</ref> The previous record had been set by the [[Great Comet of 1811]], which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.<ref name="Kidger2004"/>

The comet continued to fade as it receded, but is still being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 11&nbsp;years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7&nbsp;AU from Sun, the comet was still active as indicated by the detection of the CO-driven coma.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Szab<U+00F3> |first= Gy.

== Orbital changes ==
[[File:Hale-Bopp orbit.svg|thumb|300px|right|Hale-Bopp at perihelion in April 1, 1997]]

Over many orbits, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high orbital [[inclination]]s and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Hale-Bopp has about a 15%&nbsp;chance of eventually becoming a [[sungrazing comet]] through this process.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Orbit Determination and Evolution of Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996MNRAS.281..916B | last=Bailey | first=M.

It has been calculated that the previous visit by Hale-Bopp occurred in July 2215&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Marsden1997" /> The comet may have presented a similar sight to people then, as the estimated closest approach to Earth was 1.4&nbsp;AU, but no records of it have survived. Hale-Bopp may have had a near collision with Jupiter in early June 2215&nbsp;BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215&nbsp;BC may have been its first passage through the [[inner solar system]].<ref name="Marsden1997" />

== Scientific results ==
[[File:Hale-Bopp sodium tail.gif|thumb|right|200px|Comet Hale-Bopp's neutral sodium tail (the straight tail extending up to the left from the nucleus)<ref name="Cremonese1997" />]]

Comet Hale-Bopp was observed intensively by [[astronomy|astronomers]] during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production rate of the comet was very high (up to 2.0{{e|6}} kg/s),<ref name="Jewitt1999">{{cite journal | title= Particulate Mass Loss from Comet Hale-Bopp | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AJ....117.1056J | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 1056<U+2013>1062 | last=Jewitt | first = David | coauthors=Matthews, Henry | year=1999 | doi=10.1086/300743}}</ref> which may have made the inner coma [[Optical thickness|optically thick]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fern<U+00E1>ndez | first= Yanga R. | coauthors= Wellnitz, Dennis D.; Buie, Marc W.; et al. | title = The Inner Coma and Nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp: Results from a Stellar Occultation | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999Icar..140..205F | year = 1999 | journal = Icarus | volume = 140 | pages = 205<U+2013>220 | doi = 10.1006/icar.1999.6127}}</ref> Based on the properties of the dust grains<U+2014>high temperature, high [[albedo]] and strong 10&nbsp;<U+03BC>m silicate emission feature<U+2014>the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Observations of Unusually Small Dust Grains in the Coma of Comet Hale-Bopp C/1995 O1 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...549..635M | last = Mason | first=C.

It is also to be noted that the comet Hale-Bopp showed highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet. Such polarization is the result of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends on the nature of the grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale-Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Polarimetric observations of the comet Hale-Bopp | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998A%26AS..129..489G | last = Ganesh | first=S. | coauthors=Joshi, U.

=== Sodium tail ===
One of the most remarkable discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail. In addition to the well-known gas and dust tails, Hale-Bopp also exhibited a faint [[sodium]] tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Hale-Bopp's sodium tail consisted of [[electric charge|neutral atoms]] (not [[ion]]s), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.<ref name="Cremonese1997">{{cite journal | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume = 490 | pages =L199<U+2013>L202 | year = 1997 | doi =  10.1086/311040 | title = Neutral Sodium from Comet Hale-Bopp: A Third Type of Tail| author = Cremonese, G.; Boehnhardt, H.; Crovisier, J.;Rauer, H.; Fitzsimmons, A.; Fulle, M.; Licandro, J.; Pollacco, D.; Tozzi, G. P.; West, R. M.}}</ref>

The source of the sodium appeared to be the inner [[coma (cometary)|coma]], although not necessarily the [[comet nucleus|nucleus]]. There are several possible mechanisms for generating a source of sodium atoms, including collisions between dust grains surrounding the nucleus, and 'sputtering' of sodium from dust grains by [[ultraviolet]] light. It is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating Hale-Bopp's sodium tail, and the narrow<ref name="Cremonese1997" /> and diffuse<ref>{{cite journal | last=Wilson |first=J. K.| coauthors= Baumgardner, J.; Mendillo, M.| title=Three tails of comet Hale-Bopp | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998GeoRL..25..225W | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | volume=25 | issue=3 | pages=225<U+2013>228 | doi=10.1029/97GL03704 | year=1998}}</ref> components of the tail may have different origins.<ref>{{cite journal | first=G. | last=Cremonese | coauthors=Fulle, M. | title=Sodium In Comets | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997EM%26P...79..209C | journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume=79 | issue=1 | pages=209<U+2013>220 | year=1997 | doi=10.1023/A:1006245619568}}</ref>

While the comet's dust tail roughly followed the path of the comet's orbit and the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven away from the comet's head by [[radiation pressure]].<ref name="Cremonese1997" />

=== Deuterium abundance ===
The abundance of [[deuterium]] in Comet Hale-Bopp in the form of [[heavy water]] was found to be about twice that of Earth's [[ocean]]s. If Hale-Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.<ref name="Cometwater">{{cite journal | title = Cometary Deuterium | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 90 | issue = 1<U+2013>2 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005269208310 | pages = 33<U+2013>43 | first = Roland | last = Meier | coauthors = Owen, Tobias C.}}</ref>

Deuterium was also detected in many other [[hydrogen]] compounds in the comet. The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in [[interstellar cloud]]s, rather than in the [[solar nebula]]. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that Comet Hale-Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25<U+2013>45&nbsp;[[kelvin]].<ref name="Cometwater"/>

=== Organics ===
Spectroscopic observations of Hale-Bopp revealed the presence of many [[organic chemistry|organic chemicals]], several of which had never been detected in comets before. These complex molecules may exist within the cometary nucleus, or might be synthesised by reactions in the comet.<ref name="Cometorganic">{{cite journal | title = Organic synthesis in the coma of Comet Hale<U+2013>Bopp?| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume = 320 | issue = 4 | year = 2002| doi = 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04208.x | pages = L61<U+2013>L64  | first = S. D. | last = Rodgers| coauthors = Charnley, S. B.}}</ref>

=== Detection of argon ===
Hale-Bopp was the first comet where the [[noble gas]] [[argon]] was detected.<ref name="Argon" /> Noble gases are chemically inert and highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, they can be used for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. [[Krypton]] has a sublimation temperature of 16<U+2013>20&nbsp;K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Detection of Soft X-rays and a Sensitive Search for Noble Gases in Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1997Sci...277.1488K | last=Krasnopolsky | first=Vladimir A. | coauthors=Mumma, Michael J.; Abbott, Mark; Flynn, Brian C.; Meech, Karen J.; Yeomans, Donald K.; Feldman, Paul D.; Cosmovici, Cristiano B. | year = 1997 | journal=Science | volume=277 | pages=1488<U+2013>1491 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5331.1488 | pmid=9278508}}</ref> while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance.<ref name="Argon">{{cite journal | title=The Discovery of Argon in Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...544L.169S | last=Stern | first=S.

Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet was formed beyond Neptune in the [[Kuiper belt]] region and then migrated outward to the [[Oort cloud]].<ref name="Argon" />

=== Rotation ===
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp Death Valley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Comet Hale-Bopp over [[Zabriskie Point]], [[Death Valley]], USA]]

Comet Hale-Bopp's activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations of the material streaming away from these jets<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/anim30.html |title=Bergeron Comet Hale-Bopp Animation |accessdate=2008-10-14 |work=Stardust|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA}}</ref> allowed astronomers to measure the rotation period of the comet, which was found to be about 11 hours 46 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series |volume = 136 |pages =245<U+2013>256 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1051/aas:1999213 | title = Dust continuum imaging of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp): Rotation period and dust outflow velocity | author = Warell, J.; Lagerkvist, C.-I.; Lagerros, J.

=== Satellite dispute ===
In 1999 a paper was published that hypothesised the existence of a binary [[comet nucleus|nucleus]] to fully explain the observed pattern of Comet Hale-Bopp's dust emission. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30&nbsp;km, with the main nucleus being about 70&nbsp;km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Detection of a Satellite Orbiting The Nucleus of Comet Hale<U+2013>Bopp (C/1995 O1) | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006230712665 | pages = 155<U+2013>163
| first = Z. | last = Sekanina}}</ref>

The findings of this paper were disputed by observational astronomers, as even with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images of the comet revealed no trace of a double nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal| last=McCarthy | first=D.

Given the very small mass of cometary nuclei, the orbit of a binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and [[planet]]s.

Observations using [[adaptive optics]] in late 1997 and early 1998 were claimed to show a double peak in the brightness of the nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marchis | first = F. |coauthors = Boehnhardt, H.; Hainaut, O. R.; Le Mignant, D. | journal = Astronomy & Astrophysics | year = 1999 |

== UFO claims ==
In November 1996 amateur astronomer [[Chuck Shramek]] of [[Houston, Texas]] took a [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] image of the comet, which showed a fuzzy, slightly elongated object nearby. When his computer sky-viewing program did not identify the star, Shramek called the [[Art Bell]] radio program to announce that he had discovered a "Saturn-like object" following Hale-Bopp. [[unidentified flying object|UFO]] enthusiasts, such as [[remote viewing]] proponent [[Courtney Brown (researcher)|Courtney Brown]], soon concluded that there was an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[spacecraft]] following the comet.<ref name="time">{{cite news|title=The man who spread the myth | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986171,00.html | work=Time| date=April 14, 1997 | first = Leon | last = Jaroff | coauthors = Willwerth, James | accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> Several astronomers, including Alan Hale,<ref>{{cite journal | title = Hale-Bopp Comet Madness | first = Alan | last = Hale | journal = Skeptical Inquirer | year = 1997 | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 25<U+2013>28 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/9703/hale.html }}</ref> claimed the object was simply an 8.5-magnitude [[star]], SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly.<ref>{{cite book|title=Great Comets|first=Robert|last= Burnham|coauthors= Levy, David H. |year=2000 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=9780521646000 | pages=191}}</ref>

Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained an image of the object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers [[Olivier Hainaut]] and [[David J. Tholen]] of the [[University of Hawaii]] stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.<ref>{{cite web  |date=January 15, 1997 | title=Fraudulent use of a IfA/UH picture |url=http://www.sc.eso.org/~ohainaut/Hale_Bopp/hb_ufo_tholen.html | publisher=European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere |accessdate=2008-10-14|  first = David J. | last = Tholen}}</ref>

A few months later, in March 1997, the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] cult chose the appearance of the comet as a signal for their mass [[cult suicide]]. They claimed they were leaving their earthly bodies to travel to the spaceship following the comet.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Heaven's Gate: The End | first = Wendy Gale | last = Robinson | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 3 | issue = 3  | doi = 10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00077.x | doi_brokendate = 2008-11-30 | url = http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol3/issue3/robinson.html }}</ref>

Its lengthy period of visibility and extensive coverage in the media meant that Hale-Bopp was probably the most-observed comet in history, making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of [[Comet Halley|Halley's Comet]] in 1986, and certainly seen by a greater number of people than witnessed any of Halley's previous appearances. For instance, 69% of Americans had seen Hale-Bopp by April 9, 1997.<ref name="Aguirre">{{cite journal | last = Aguirre | first = Edwin L. | title = The Great Comet of 1997 | journal = Sky and Telescope | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/skyandtelescope/access/886291661.html?dids=886291661:886291661&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:PAGE&date=Jul+1997&author=Edwin+L+Aguirre&desc=The+Great+Comet+of+1997 | year = 1997 | month = July }}</ref> It was a record-breaking comet<U+2014>the furthest comet from the Sun discovered by amateurs,<ref name="stardust" /> with the largest well-measured cometary nucleus known after [[95P/Chiron]],<ref name="Fernandez2002">{{cite journal | last = Fern<U+00E1>ndez | first=Yanga R. | title = The Nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1): Size and Activity | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/pr2756540kx94403/ | year = 2002 | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 89 | issue=1 | pages = 3<U+2013>25| doi = 10.1023/A:1021545031431}}</ref> and it was visible to the naked eye for twice as long as the previous record-holder.<ref name="Kidger2004"/>  It was also brighter than magnitude&nbsp;0 for eight&nbsp;weeks, longer than any other recorded comet.<ref name="stardust" />
