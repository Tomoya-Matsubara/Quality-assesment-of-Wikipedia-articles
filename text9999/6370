The '''Lindsay pamphlet scandal''' is an [[List of Australian political scandals|Australian electoral scandal]] in which [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] volunteers distributed fake election pamphlets, claiming to be from an [[Islam]]ic organisation that was later found not to exist. The incident made national and even international headlines on [[November 21]] [[2007]], four days before the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 Australian Federal election]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7106164.stm | title=PM Howard condemns fake leaflets | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref>

The retiring [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] member of parliament representing the federal [[Division of Lindsay]], [[Jackie Kelly]], was forced to explain why her husband, local orthodontist Gary Clark, was caught distributing the pamphlets with four other people.<ref name="pamphlet">{{cite news | title=Scanned copy of leaflet | url=http://www.smh.com.au/images/Islamic%20Pamphlet.pdf | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> The pamphlets, claiming to be from "The Islamic Australia Federation", thanked the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) for supporting terrorists involved with the [[2002 Bali bombings]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Kelly's husband linked to misleading flyers | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/21/2097484.htm | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=[[November 21]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref>
The scandal disrupted the election campaign of Prime Minister [[John Howard]].

== The scandal ==

On [[20 November]], 2007, an anonymous member of the Liberal Party contacted the assistant secretary of the ALP, Luke Foley, with information that a flyer linking Foley's party with an extremist Islamic organisation was to be distributed in letterboxes throughout the suburb of [[St Marys, New South Wales|St Marys]] by Liberal members. Due to a redistribution of electoral boundaries, St Marys had recently been moved from the safe Labor seat of [[Division of Chifley|Chifley]] into Jackie Kelly's seat of Lindsay. Because of her impending retirement, Lindsay was at risk of falling to Labor. 

At 6.30pm that night, a group of Liberal members met at a home in Ladbury Avenue, [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]]. A short time later, they left that premises and entered another home across the street. This home was later identified as that of Kelly and her husband Gary Clark. In the meantime, Foley, Labor Senator [[Steve Hutchins]] and several party volunteers had organised a "sting" operation directed from the Log Cabin Hotel in Penrith. As the Liberal members entered the home in Ladbury Avenue, a Labor party member was observing them from a car parked in the street. Another group of Labor volunteers were deployed by Hutchins to St Marys to await further instructions. 

At 8.40pm, the group meeting in Ladbury Avenue left Kelly's home in three cars and drove to St Marys where they parted ways. Various Labor party members, now also including Hutchins and Foley, followed the group. In Boronia Road, the Liberal party group were approached and photographed by Hutchins and eight of his Labor volunteers as they attempted to distribute the bogus pamphlets. Hutchins immediately identified [[Jeff Egan]], Liberal party power broker and member of the State Executive, also a former deputy mayor of the [[City of the Blue Mountains]]. Egan continues to deny he was involved in or had any knowledge of the scam. A short distance away, in Magnolia Street, more Labor operatives had similarly ambushed another group of Liberals led by Clark. Clark was photographed attempting to hide his face behind one of the hoaxed flyers; Egan was also photographed with them.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22806354-5001021,00.html | title=Lib tip-off put scam sting in motion | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=[[November 23]] [[2007]] | first=Simon | last=Benson | accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Phillip | last=Coorey | title=Liberal shame over fake pamphlet | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/federal-election-2007-news/chaserstyle-prank/2007/11/22/1195321873077.html | publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Tony | last=Jones | title=Tony Jones talks to Attorney-General Philip Ruddock and Labor's Anthony Albanese | url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2007/s2098670.htm | work=Lateline | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> Greg Chijoff, husband of the new Liberal candidate for the seat of Lindsay [[Karen Chijoff]], was also found to be involved.

== The pamphlet ==

The pamphlet claimed to be from "The Islamic Australia Federation", a non-existent organisation. It strongly urged support for the Labor party in the upcoming federal election and went on to praise the ALP on a number of divisive issues, including:<ref name="pamphlet"/>

* ''[forgiving] our Muslim brothers who have been unjustly sentenced to death for the Bali bombings'', referring to the Labor party's opposition to the [[Capital punishment in Australia|death penalty]] (in particular [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McClelland]]'s comments) and the Liberals' argument that this policy supports the Bali bombers themselves<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/09/2055161.htm | title=Costello slams Labor as Bali bomber supporters | date=[[October 9]] [[2007]] | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref>
* Supporting the construction of a new [[mosque]], as well as the opening of a new mosque in [[St Marys, New South Wales|St Marys]] with the help of local and state government funding
* Support for controversial former [[Grand Mufti]] Sheik [[Taj El-Din Hilaly]] (spelt "Al-Hilaly")

The pamphlet also misspelt [[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]] as "''Ala Akba''", with the ALP logo on either side. The logo used was an obsolete one that had been retired after the previous election in [[2004]]. There was also no authorising statement, which all political advertising is required to include.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/0/57/0/PA004360.htm | work=Commonwealth electoral act 1918 | title=Section 328 | date=[[1918]] | publisher=Australian Government | accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref>

== Response ==

=== Police investigation ===

The matter was referred by both the Labor and Liberal parties to the [[Australian Electoral Commission]], who in turn referred it to the [[Australian Federal Police]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s2098543.htm | title=Howard faces last-minute campaign distraction | last=Barlow | first=Karen | work=PM | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=[[22 November]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref>

On 22nd March, 2008 NSW police confirmed that they had begun legal proceedings over the incident against five men including Greg Chijoff, Gary Clarke and [[Jeff Egan]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/lib-charges-over-leaflet/2008/03/22/1205602728688.html?s_cid=rss_national | title=Lib charges over leaflet | last=Gilmore | first=Heath | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] | date=[[March 23]], [[2008]] | accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/23/2197097.htm | title=Polic to lay charges over Lindsay pamphlet scandal | last=Gilmore | first=Heath | work=ABC News | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref>

=== Liberal Party response ===

Jeff Egan and Gary Clark were immediately expelled from the Liberal Party for their part in the Lindsay affair. Greg Chijoff, who was not a party member, was refused permission to further participate in his wife's campaign for election.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fake flyer distributors apologise | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/22/2098498.htm | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref><ref name="SMHLeafletResignation">{{cite news | title=Leaflet scandal triggers resignation | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Rudd-condemns-Libs-over-bogus-leaflet/2007/11/22/1195321922180.html | publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> While Egan denied all knowledge of the affair as a deliberate scam, Clark and Chijoff both sent letters of apology to NSW Liberal director [[Graham Jaeschke]] in which they claimed their wives were also unaware of the plot. Karen Chijoff also claims she knew nothing of it.<ref>{{cite news | title=Chijoff 'knew nothing' of fake flyers |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/24/2100097.htm  | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=[[November 24]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> This claim was later questioned by senior Liberals.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/federal-election-2007-news/foul-play-in-dead-of-night-but-who-was-in-dark/2007/11/22/1195321951489.html | title=Foul play in the dead of night, but who was in the dark? | publisher=[[The Age]] | date=[[November 23]] [[2007]] | first=Russell | last=Skelton | accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

Jackie Kelly spoke about it on radio on [[22 November]] in spite of a party directive not to do so. She said her first instinct when she saw the pamphlet was to laugh because it was a parody of some things that had occurred during the election campaign<ref name="chaserstyle">{{cite news | title=Kelly: Fake leaflets a 'Chaser-style prank' | url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22801659-29277,00.html | publisher=[[Herald Sun]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> and compared it to a prank by the satirical comedy team ''[[The Chaser]]''. 

{{cquote|When I first read it I had to laugh . . . pretty much everyone who has read (it) chuckles, in terms of the parody it does make of various things that have happened during the campaign. My view is that it's a bit of Chaser-style prank.|||Jackie Kelly|<ref name="chaserstyle"/>}}

The Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], had to spend part of his last pre-election public address to the [[National Press Club (Australia)|National Press Club]] on 22 November answering questions about the scandal rather than discussing his policies.<ref>{{cite news | title=Jihad Jackie's poor sense of humour blows up in her hapless boss's face | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/jihad-jackies-poor-sense-of-humour-blows-up-in-her-hapless-bosssface/2007/11/22/1195321948268.html | publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=[[November 23]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> He said that the Liberal Party had not authorised the leaflets,<ref>{{cite news | title=PM Howard condemns fake leaflets | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7106164.stm | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> Howard was quoted as saying, "What more can I do? I have condemned it. I've dissociated myself from it. I think it's stupid, it's offensive, it's wrong, it's untrue. For heaven's sake, get a sense of proportion."<ref name="SMHLeafletResignation"/>

=== ALP response ===

Labor leader [[Kevin Rudd]] said the bogus election flyer showed that all the Liberal Party had to offer voters so close to the election was desperation and dirty tactics and that the Prime Minister still had questions to answer over the incident.<ref name="SMHLeafletResignation"/>

=== Islamic community response ===

The [[Sydney]]-based chairman of the [[Australian Federation of Islamic Councils]], Ikebal Patel, said falsification of election material created a further rift between mainstream community and Muslims.<ref>{{cite news | first=Laura | last=Anderson | title=Husband of Libs candidate quits over race smear scandal | url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22801717-5013964,00.html | publisher=[[The Advertiser]] | date=[[November 22]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> The current Mufti of Australia, [[Fehmi Naji]], said "When people read stuff like that, they say 'why are we putting up with Muslims?'

=== Media commentary ===

Media reports suggested this incident was part of a pattern of deceptive behaviour undertaken by Liberal party members in previous elections. Various materials, including fake how-to-vote cards and pamphlets with the ALP logo, were allegedly produced by Liberal Party members<ref>{{cite news | title=Playing dirty an artform in the west | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/federal-election-2007-news/playing-dirty-an-artform-in-the-west/2007/11/22/1195321949397.html | publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=[[November 23]], [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref>.

In response to Kelly's claim that the matter was a "''Chaser''-style prank" ''Chaser'' member [[Julian Morrow]] called the ''prank'' "ham-fisted" and said the pamphlet did not read like a joke. He acknowledged that ''The Chaser'' had done a stunt in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]] that involved claiming a mosque was to be built in the neighbourhood and asking for comments from people on the street. However, he said the aim of their stunt was to reveal the prejudices in the Australian community, not accentuate them in order to try to return the Coalition to government.<ref>{{cite video | url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hack/podcast/thursday/hack_20071122.mp3 | format=MP3 | medium=radio | title=Hack | date2=2007-11-22 | publisher=[[Triple J]] | time=0:00:22 | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref>

On the day of the election, ''Chaser'' member [[Chas Licciardello]] confronted Karen Chijoff in an [[Osama bin Laden]] costume he had used previously [[The Chaser APEC pranks|during the APEC summit]] and attempted to pass her copies of the flyer.<ref>{{cite news | title=Chaser's Chas Licciardello enjoys a big day out |url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22814851-5006301,00.html?from=mostpop  | publisher=[[The Advertiser]] | date=[[November 24]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

==Aftermath==

Five men were charged over the Lindsay leaflet scandal. On [[29 April]] [[2008]] Greg Chijoff and Troy Craig pleaded guilty over the scam when it went before the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney.  The charges against Craig were dismissed.  Chijoff was fined $750 on [[7 May]]<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.smh.com.au/leaflet-charge-dismissed-against-man/20080429-299q.html|title = Leaflet charge dismissed against man| publisher = Sydney Morning Herald| date = 29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23729323-29277,00.html| title = Lib supporter sorry for leaflet drop| publisher = News Ltd.

A fifth man who was charged, Robert Mathew Holstein, was fined $500 on [[20 May]]<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/election-con-confession/2008/04/29/1209234833370.html| title = Election con confession| publisher = Sydney Morning Herald| date = 29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23729323-29277,00.html| title = Lib supporter sorry for leaflet drop| publisher = News Ltd.

[[Karen Chijoff]] declared both her political career and her marriage to be "truly over", and would look toward rejoining the workforce. However, she did not rule out a return to politics at some stage, declaring it would be up to the Liberal Party to make that decision. Ms Chijoff continues to deny any knowledge of the leaflet campaign.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23042467-2,00.html | title='Racist leaflet' candidate folds up her career | date=[[January 13]] [[2008]] | publisher=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] | first=Andrew | last=Chesterton | accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.theage.com.au/chijoff-marriage-over-career-in-doubt/20080113-1lnh.html | title=Chijoff marriage over, career in doubt | date=[[January 13]] [[2008]] | publisher=[[The Age]] | accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref>

In June 2008, Labor revealed it has reason to believe the pamphlets were printed at a Liberal MP's office at taxpayer expense.<ref>http://www.theage.com.au/national/lib-racehate-scam-linked-to-mps-office-20080623-2vlb.html</ref>
