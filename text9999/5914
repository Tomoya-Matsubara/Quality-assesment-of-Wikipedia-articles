'''Pete Best''' (b. [[24 November]] [[1941]], in [[Chennai|Madras, India]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musician]], best known as the original [[drummer]] for [[The Beatles]].

After moving from India to [[Liverpool]] in 1945, Best's mother, [[Mona Best]] ([[1924]]-[[1988]]) started [[The Casbah Coffee Club]] in the cellar of the Best's house in Liverpool, which became very popular&mdash;the membership list grew to over a thousand&mdash;and where The Beatles (then known as [[The Quarrymen]]) played some of their first concerts. The club was also known as The Casbah Club, or simply The Casbah. Best played there with his first band, The Black Jacks, and later with The Beatles.   

Best joined The Beatles on [[12 August]] [[1960]], only one day before they were to go to [[Hamburg]] to play a season of concerts. He was dismissed from the group two years later, on [[16 August]] [[1962]], but was never given a full explanation as to the reason why. He later worked as a [[civil service|civil servant]] for 20 years, before starting The Pete Best Band. Best has been married for over 40 years to Kathy Best; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.

The Bests lived for a short time at John Best's family home in [[West Derby]], called "Ellerslie Manor", until Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife.<ref name="BestRoagPetep21"> Roag and Pete Best "The Beatles: The True Beginnings" 2003 p21</ref> The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool, but Mona was always looking for a large house<U+2014>as she had been used to in India<U+2014>instead of a smaller [[semi-detached]] house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948, where the Bests lived for nine years, Rory saw a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman's Green, in 1957, and told Mona about it.<ref>[http://www.beatlestours.co.uk/Pete%20Best.htm 17 Queenscourt Road] beatlestours.co.uk - Retrieved 1 December 2007 </ref> The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by [[Lester Piggott]] in the 1954 [[Epsom Derby]] called, "Never Say Die", which won at 33-1, and used her winnings to buy the house in 1957.<ref name="BestHappyMan">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=447201&in_page_id=1773 Pete Best is a happy man - 7 April 2007] dailymail.co.uk - Retrieved 5 November 2007 </ref><ref name="Spitzp161"> Spitz 2005 p161</ref> The house had previously been owned by the West Derby [[Association of Conservative Clubs|Conservative Club]], and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool, as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an [[acre]] of land.<ref name="BestRoagPetep16"> Roag and Pete Best "The Beatles: The True Beginnings" 2003 p16</ref><ref name="MilesPage57"> Miles 1997 p57</ref> All the rooms were painted dark green or brown, and the garden was totally overgrown.<ref name="TheCasbahClub">[http://www.samleach.com/photos_beatles.html Photos of The Casbah Club] samleach.com - Retrieved 10 October 2007 </ref> Mona later opened The Casbah Coffee Club in its large cellar.

[[Image:HamburgKarte Version01 070527 150dpi.gif|thumb|left|250px| City map of Hamburg, showing the start of the Reeperbahn (lower middle left).]]
In 1960, [[Allan Williams]] arranged a season of bookings for The Beatles in Hamburg, starting on [[12 August]] [[1960]], but said that he was not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped that he could find a better act to follow them.<ref name="Spitzp203"> Spitz 2005 p203</ref> 

Having no permanent drummer, [[Paul McCartney]] looked around for someone to fill the Hamburg position. Best had been seen playing with The Black Jacks in The Casbah, and it was noted that he had become a steady drummer, meaning that he played the [[bass drum]] on all four [[beat]]s in the [[Bar (music)|bar]], which pushed the [[rhythm]].<ref name="Spitzp204"> Spitz 2005 p204</ref> Best was known in Liverpool as being "mean, moody, and magnificent" by female fans, which convinced McCartney he would be good for the group.<ref name=<U+201D>TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD<U+201D>> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:39:26) McCartney talking Best<U+2019>s reputation in Liverpool</ref> After The Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg with group, but lied by saying they would earn [[<U+00A3>]]15 per week each.<ref name="Milesp57"/><ref name="CynthiaJohnp69-70"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 pp69-70</ref> As Best had passed his school [[exam]]s<U+2014>unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of them<U+2014>he had the chance to go to a teacher-training college, but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move.<ref name="Spitzp6"> Spitz 2005 p6</ref> Best had an [[audition]] in the Jacaranda club&mdash;owned by Williams&mdash;and travelled to Hamburg the very next day with The Beatles.<ref name=<U+201D>TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD<U+201D>> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:39:49) Harrison talking about the audition with Best</ref><ref>[http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/archives/my-beatle-days.shtml My Beatle Days, by Pete Best] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007 </ref> Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed, as The Beatles hadn't found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but didn't tell Best in case he asked for more money.<ref name="Goldsmithp46"> Goldsmith 2004 p46</ref>

The Beatles first played at the Indra club in Hamburg, but slept in the Bambi Kino (cinema) in small, dirty rooms, which were noisy, cold, and directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the ''Indra'', Best remembered it as being a depressing place that was filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger [[Kaiserkeller]].<ref name="Spitzp208"> Spitz 2005 p208</ref> As Best had been the only one to take [[O-Level]] German at school, he could communicate with [[Bruno Koschmider]]&mdash;the club's owner&mdash;and the clientele better than the rest of the group.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp77"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p77</ref> After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, The Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller.<ref name="MilesPage57-58"> Miles 1997 pp57-8</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp76"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p76</ref> In October 1960, they left Koschmider's club to work at the Top Ten Club, which was run by Peter Eckhorn, as he offered the group more money, and a slightly better place to sleep, though by doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage93"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p93</ref><ref name="MilesPage71-72"> Miles 1997 pp71-72</ref> When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, Best found a [[condom]] in his luggage, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set fire to it.<ref name="Spitzp230"> Spitz 2005 p230</ref> There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted [[arson]]. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local [[prison|jail]] and were [[deportation|deported]]<U+2014>as was [[George Harrison]], for working under the legal age limit on [[30 November]] [[1960]].<ref name="MilesPage72-73"> Miles 1997 pp72-73</ref><ref> Lewisohn p24</ref><ref name=<U+201D>TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD<U+201D>> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:49:56) Notice telling Harrison to leave Hamburg.</ref> 

Back in Liverpool, no-one contacted each other for two weeks, but Mona and Best made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group's equipment, which they eventually managed to do.<ref name="Spitzp231"> Spitz 2005 p231</ref> The ex-Black Jacks guitarist Newby was invited to play bass with them for four concerts, as Sutcliffe had decided to stay on in Hamburg.<ref>[http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1960/1960.html Photo of Chas Newby] beatlesource.com - Retrieved 5 November 2007 </ref> Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing, and remembered Best's drumming to be very powerful, which pushed the group to play harder and louder.<ref name="Spitzp5"> Spitz 2005 p5</ref> It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to "Crank it up" (play as loud as possible).<ref name="Spitzp214"> Spitz 2005 p214</ref> Newby played with the group at Litherland Town Hall and at The Casbah.<ref name="Spitzp234"> Spitz 2005 p234</ref> When the group returned to Hamburg, Best was invited to sing a speciality number called "[[Peppermint Twist]]" while McCartney played the drums, but Best always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage.<ref>[http://www.eskimo.com/~bpentium/beatles/besttape/besttape.html Best and "Peppermint Twist"] eskimo.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007 </ref>   

===My Bonnie===
The reunited Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961. While playing at the Top Ten Club they were recruited by singer [[Tony Sheridan]] to act as his [[Backup band|backing band]] on a series of recordings for the German [[Polydor Records]] label, produced by bandleader [[Bert Kaempfert]].<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp97"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p97</ref><ref name="LewisohnChronicles">LewisohnChronicles</ref> Kaempfert signed the group to a Polydor contract at the first session on [[June 22]] [[1961]]. On [[31 October]] [[1961]], Polydor released the recording "[[My Bonnie]]" (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur) which appeared on the German charts under the name "Tony Sheridan and The Beat Brothers"&mdash;a generic name used for whoever happened to be in Sheridan's backup band.<ref> Spitz 2005 p250</ref> The song was later released in the UK.<ref name="MyBonnie"> <U+201C>My Bonnie<U+201C> / <U+201C>The Saints<U+201C> 23 April 1962.

==Parlophone audition==

The Beatles played a [[Parlophone]] audition at [[Abbey Road Studios]] for [[George Martin]] on [[6 June]] [[1962]].<ref name="Martin120-123"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994 pp120-123</ref> Ron Richards and his engineer [[Norman Smith]] recorded four songs, which Martin (who was not present during the recording) listened to at the end of the session. The recording convinced Martin that the group was good enough to be signed to a contract (even though he had already signed a contract with [[Brian Epstein]]) but with one exception; Martin and his engineers did not like Best's playing.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1997 p90</ref><ref name="Spitzp318"> Spitz 2005 p318</ref><ref name=<U+201D>TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD<U+201D>> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 1:02:54) Martin talking about Best<U+2019>s drumming.</ref>

===Dismissal===
When the group heard that Martin did not like Best's drumming, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison asked Epstein<U+2014>who had taken over as manager in January<U+2014>to fire Best from the band.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp119"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p119</ref> Before Epstein became The Beatles' manager, Best had arranged all the bookings in Liverpool, after they had parted company with Williams.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp106"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p106</ref><ref name="Spitzp330"> Spitz 2005 p330</ref> Epstein agonised about the decision, and asked [[Bob Wooler]] if it was a good idea, to which Wooler replied that Best was too popular with the fans to get rid of him.<ref name="Spitzp329"> Spitz 2005 p329</ref> Nevertheless, Epstein dismissed Best on [[16 August]] [[1962]], which was almost exactly two years after Best had joined the group.<ref name="Milesp57"> Miles 1997 p57</ref><ref name="Spitzp330"> Spitz 2005 p330</ref>

Aspinall was waiting downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after Best's dismissal, and was the first one to talk to the then ex-Beatle in The Grapes [[public house|pub]], across from [[The Cavern Club]], where The Beatles had often played.<ref name="Spitzp331"> Spitz 2005 p331</ref> Aspinall was furious and said that he would stop working for them as well&mdash;he had been employed as the band's road manager and personal assistant&mdash;but Best strongly advised him not to. Aspinall decided to stay, but ended his relationship with Mona (and his three-week-old baby, Roag). Aspinall asked McCartney and Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best, to which they replied, "It<U+2019>s got nothing to do with you&mdash;you<U+2019>re only the driver."<ref name="MerseyBeatNeilAspinallPage2">[http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/neilaspinall2.shtml Aspinall, The Beatles and money - Mersey Beat] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 11 February 2007 </ref> 

[[Ringo Starr]] took Best's place, as Starr had previously played with [[Rory Storm|Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]], the alternate band in the Kaiserkeller, and had stepped in to drum with The Beatles in Hamburg and Liverpool when Best was ill or unable to play.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1997 p90</ref><ref>[http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/rorystorm_hamburg.shtml Best and Bill Harry on Rory Storm] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 5 November 2007 </ref> Best's dismissal was reported on the front-page of the ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' magazine, upsetting many Beatles' fans. The Beatles had to suffer jeers and heckling in the street and on stage for weeks afterwards, with fans shouting, "Ringo never, Pete Best forever!" One agitated fan [[head-butt|head-butted]] Harrison in The Cavern, giving him a [[black eye]].<ref name=<U+201D>TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD<U+201D>> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 1:04:24) Harrison  talking about <U+201C>Pete forever, Ringo never!<U+201D>.</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp120"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p120</ref> Lennon would later comment about Best's dismissal by saying, "We were cowards, we got Epstein to do the dirty work for us."<ref name="BestHappyMan"/>

===Reasons for Best's dismissal===

[[Image:Best Sutcliffe and Harrison.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Best wearing a white shirt on stage in Hamburg, with Sutcliffe and Harrison in black leather jackets (1961).]]
Best has never been told why he was dismissed from The Beatles, as the only reason Epstein gave was, "The lads don't want you in the group anymore".<ref name="Spitzp330"> Spitz 2005 p330</ref> It has been documented that while Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison usually spent their offstage time together in Hamburg and Liverpool, writing songs or socialising, Best generally went off alone. This left Best on the outside, as he was not privy to many of the group's experiences, references, and in-jokes.<ref name="BeatlesIreland">[http://www.iol.ie/~beatlesireland/Reviews/books/drummedout.htm The Sacking Of Pete Best]  iol.ie/~beatlesireland - Retrieved 31 May 2007 </ref> 

On their first trip to Hamburg, The Beatles realised that the stage suits they wore could not stand up to the hours of sweating and jumping about on stage every night, so they all bought leather jackets, jeans and cowboy boots, which were much tougher. Best preferred to play in shirtsleeves, so didn't follow the style of the group, even though he was later photographed wearing a leather jacket and jeans.<ref name="Spitzp213-214"> Spitz 2005 pp213-214</ref> Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Sutcliffe were introduced to drugs in Hamburg. As they had to play for hours every night, they often took [[Preludin]] to keep themselves awake, which were given to them by German customers or by [[Astrid Kirchherr]], whose mother bought them.<ref name=<U+201D>TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD<U+201D>> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:44:28) Starr and Harrison talking about Preludins in Hamburg</ref> Lennon would often take four or five, but Best always refused to join in.<ref name="Milesp66-67"> Miles 1997 pp66-67</ref><ref name="Spitzp219"> Spitz 2005 p219</ref>  

Kirchherr asked the Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshots]] that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in a municipal park called "der Dom" which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all<U+2014>minus Best who decided not to go<U+2014>to her mother's house in Altona.<ref name="Spitzp223"> Spitz 2005. p223</ref><ref name=<U+201D>TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD<U+201D>> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:47:16) Harrison talking about their friends: Kircherr, Voormann and Volmer.</ref> Best was described by Dot Rhone<U+2014>McCartney's girlfriend at the time, who later visited Hamburg<U+2014>as being very quiet, and never taking part in conversations with the group.<ref name="Spitzp246"> Spitz 2005 p246</ref> 

Best's popularity with fans was a source of friction, as many female fans considered Best to be the band's best-looking member.<ref name="Spitzp322"> Spitz 2005 p322</ref> In addition, Epstein became exasperated with Best's refusal to adopt the [[mop-top]]-style [[Beatle haircut]] as part of their unified look, although Best later claimed that he was never asked to change his hairstyle. In a 1995 [[BBC]] ''[[Radio Merseyside]]'' interview, Kirchherr, who was former bassist Sutcliffe's girlfriend at the time, explained: 

: {{cquote | My boyfriend, [[Klaus Voorman]], had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very, very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the [[Brylcreem]] out of his hair, and asking me to cut his hair for him.

[[Radio Merseyside]] presenter, Spencer Leigh, wrote a book chronicling Best's firing, suggesting that the other members, McCartney in particular, were jealous.<ref name="Leighp01"> Leigh <U+201C>Drummed Out!: The Sacking of Pete Best<U+201C> 1998 </ref> During the ''Teenagers' Turn'' showcase in [[Manchester]], John, Paul and George walked on stage to applause, but when Best walked on, the girls screamed.<ref name="Spitzp322"> Spitz 2005 p322</ref> Best was surrounded at the stage door afterwards by attentive females while the other members were ignored after signing a few autographs. McCartney's father, [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]], was present at the time and admonished Best by saying: "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back?  I think that was very selfish of you".<ref name="Spitzp322"> Spitz 2005 p322</ref> Jim later encountered the dismissed Best in The Cavern Club when a Beatles' gig was being recorded for the [[ITV]] series ''Know the North'', and said "Great, isn't it! They're on TV!" Observers reported that Best said nothing, and quietly left.<ref name="Claysonp01"> Clayson <U+201C>Paul McCartney<U+201C> (Beatle) 2004 </ref>

Although Martin used a session drummer for The Beatles' first single<U+2014>as many producers did at the time<U+2014>he was shocked that Epstein had sacked Best: {{cquote |He seemed to be the most saleable commodity as far as looks went. It was a surprise when I learned that they had dropped Pete. The drums were important to me for a record, but they didn<U+2019>t matter much otherwise. Fans don<U+2019>t pay particular attention to the quality of the drumming".<ref name="HarryBeatlesEncyclopedia"> Harry 2001 - The Beatles<U+2019> Encyclopedia</ref>}} Martin used a [[session musician]], [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]], on the third session for "[[Love Me Do]]" on 11 September, and not Starr, who was Best's replacement.<ref name="Spitzp353"> Spitz 2005 p353</ref>

===After The Beatles===

Soon after Best was dismissed, Epstein tried to console him by offering to build another group around him, but Best turned him down. Feeling let-down and depressed, he sat at home for two weeks&mdash;not wanting to face anybody or answer the inevitable questions about why he had been sacked.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp119"> Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p119</ref> Best joined Lee Curtis & the All Stars, which then broke off from Curtis and became Pete Best & the All Stars. They signed to [[Decca Records]]&mdash;who had previously rejected The Beatles&mdash;and released the single "I'm Gonna Knock On Your Door", which was not a hit.<ref name="AfterTheBeatles"/> Best later relocated to the [[United States]] along with songwriters Wayne Bickerton and Tony Waddington. As The Pete Best Four, and later as The Pete Best Combo (increasing their number to five) they toured America with a combination of 1950s songs and original tunes, recording for small labels, but had little success.<ref name="AfterTheBeatles">[http://www.petebest.com/1963.asp After The Beatles] petebest.com/1963 - Retrieved 4 December 2007 </ref> They ultimately released an album on [[Cameo Records]] titled ''Best Of The Beatles''; a play on Best's name, leading to disappointment for record buyers who expected a Beatles' [[compilation album|compilation]]. The group disbanded shortly afterwards. Bickerton and Waddington were to find greater success as songwriters in the 1970s, writing a series of hits by the [[The Rubettes|Rubettes]].

Best decided to leave show business, and by the time of [[Hunter Davies]]' 1968 authorised Beatles' biography, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles' association. He once tried to commit suicide, but was talked out of it by his mother, Mona, and his brother, Rory.<ref name="BestHappyMan"/> Best did [[shift work]] loading bread into the back of delivery vans, earning <U+00A3>8 a week, and married a girl named Kathy (in 1968) who worked behind the biscuit counter at a [[Woolworths Group|Woolworth's]] store.

In time, Best began giving interviews to the media, wrote about his time with The Beatles, and served as a [[technical advisor]] for the [[television movie]] ''[[Birth of the Beatles]]''.
