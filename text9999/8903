He was selected [[List of first overall NHL draft picks|first overall]] by the [[Boston Bruins]] in the [[1997 NHL Entry Draft]] and went on to play seven seasons with the club. During the [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], he was traded to the Sharks. Splitting the campaign between the two teams, he received the [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] and [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Memorial Trophies]] as the league's leading point-scorer and most valuable player, respectively.<ref name=MVP>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2006/06/23/SPGC3JJ9801.DTL |title=NHL AWARDS / 'Humbled' Thornton named MVP |format= |work= The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-10-29 | first=Ross | last=McKeon}}</ref> Thornton's on-ice vision, strength on the puck, deft passing ability, and [[Power forward (ice hockey)|power forward]] style of play have led to him becoming one of the league's premier top line centres.<ref name="trade-to-sj">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2242875 |title=ESPN - Thornton traded to Sharks for three players - NHL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |author=Associated Press |date= |accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref> Listed at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, he has received the nickname '''Jumbo Joe'''.

==Playing career==
===Amateur career===
Thornton grew up playing [[minor ice hockey|minor hockey]] in his hometown of [[St. Thomas, Ontario]], for the St. Thomas Travelers.  He played "AA" hockey for the Travelers until joining a peewee team that won an [[Ontario Minor Hockey Association]] (OMHA) championship in 1992<U+2013>93.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Moving on to the bantam level, Thornton joined the "AAA" Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs of the Minor Hockey Alliance of Ontario for the 1993<U+2013>94 season. During his bantam year, he also appeared in six games for the Junior B [[St. Thomas Stars]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA). The following season, he joined the Stars full-time and reeled off 104 points over 50 games.<ref name=nhl>{{cite web|title=Joe Thornton's NHL Profile|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8466138|accessdate=2011-03-07|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}</ref>

Beginning in [[1995<U+2013>96 OHL season|1995<U+2013>96]], Thornton began a two-year career in the [[major junior hockey|major junior]] [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) with the [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]].  He posted a 76-point season in his first year, earning both [[Emms Family Award|OHL]] and [[CHL Rookie of the Year]] honours.<ref name=tsn>{{cite web|title=Joe Thornton's TSN Profile|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=39|accessdate=2011-03-07|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref>  The [[1996<U+2013>97 OHL season|following season]], Thornton improved to 41 goals and 122 points, second overall in league scoring behind [[Marc Savard]] of the [[Oshawa Generals]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and was named to the OHL Second All-Star Team.<ref name=tsn/>

===Boston Bruins (1997<U+2013>2005)===
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
After his second OHL season, Thornton was selected first overall in the [[1997 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Boston Bruins]]. Thornton suffered a fractured arm in the Bruins' preseason but made their roster for the [[1997<U+2013>98 NHL season|1997-98 campaign]]. He scored his first NHL goal on December 3, 1997, in a 3<U+2013>0 win against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=NHL LAST NIGHT; Hasek Blanks Anaheim|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E5DA123DF937A35751C1A961958260|accessdate=2009-01-21|date=1997-12-05|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref> Coach [[Pat Burns]] was measured in his deployment of Thornton, using him almost exclusively on the fourth [[line (ice hockey)|line]] and making him a regular healthy scratch. Averaging eight minutes and five seconds of ice time per game over the course of the season,<ref>{{Cite web|title=1997-1998 - Regular Season - Boston Bruins - Skater - Time On Ice - Time On Ice Per Game|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/playerstats.htm?fetchKey=19982BOSSASALL&sort=avgTOIPerGame&viewName=timeOnIce|accessdate=2011-10-22|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}</ref> he registered three goals and seven points in 55 games as a rookie. In the 1998 playoffs, Thornton went scoreless in six games.

In 1998-99, Thornton saw significantly more ice-time, averaging 15 minutes and 20 seconds per game,<ref>{{cite web|title=1998-1999 - Regular Season - Boston Bruins - Skater - Time On Ice - Time On Ice Per Game|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/playerstats.htm?fetchKey=19992BOSSASALL&sort=avgTOIPerGame&viewName=timeOnIce|accessdate=2011-10-22|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}</ref> and improved to 41 points in 81 games, as well as a 9-point effort in 11 playoff games.

Thornton continued to build into a key player in the Bruins' lineup, increasing his points total in each of the following two campaigns. Prior to the [[2002<U+2013>03 NHL season|2002<U+2013>03 season]], he was named team captain, succeeding [[Jason Allison]], who had left for the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in 2001; the captaincy position was vacant for a full season after Allison's departure. In his first season as team captain, Thornton recorded 68 points over 66 games. The following year, he notched his first career [[List of NHL players with 100-point seasons|100-point season]] with 36 goals, a career-high, and 65 assists. He ranked third in league point-scoring, behind [[Peter Forsberg]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and [[Markus N<U+00E4>slund]] from the [[Vancouver Canucks]].

Thornton's production declined to 73 points in 77 games in the 2003-04 campaign. He suffered a fractured right cheekbone in a fight with Rangers center [[Eric Lindros]] during a game on January 19, 2004. The two power forwards fought after Lindros cross checked Thornton to the head. The injury required surgery,<ref>{{cite news|title=Thornton to have surgery|url=http://articles.boston.com/2004-01-22/sports/29200767_1_surgery-today-joe-thornton-eric-lindros|accessdate=2011-10-22|date=2004-01-22|work=[[Boston Globe]]}}</ref> keeping him out of the lineup for three games.<ref name=tsn>{{cite web|title=Joe Thornton|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=39|accessdate=2011-10-22|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref> Thornton's combination of size and skill had him touted as the "next Eric Lindros" when he first entered the league, but following his injury Thornton's style of play changed dramatically from that of a aggressive power forward to more of a finesse player, and his penalty minutes plummeted from that season onward.{{Fact|date=October 2011}} The 2003-04 campaign also saw a drop in Thornton's goal-scoring production that has never rebounded, as his last 30-goal season remains the 2002-03 season.

=== HC Davos and trade to San Jose (2004<U+2013>05) ===
After his production decreased to 73 points over 77 games in [[2003<U+2013>04 NHL season|2003<U+2013>04]], Thornton went abroad to play for [[HC Davos]] of the Swiss [[National League A]] due to the [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout]]. He played on a [[Line (ice hockey)|line]] with fellow NHL players [[Rick Nash]] and [[Niklas Hagman]], helping HC Davos to a league championship and [[Spengler Cup]] win. Since then Nash and Thornton keep a close contact to [[Arno del Curto]] and HC Davos, Thornton returns every summer to train for up to a month with the club.<ref name="lockout">{{cite web|url=http://hockeydraft.ca/players/joe-thornton.aspx |title=Joe Thornton |publisher=Hockeydraft.ca |date= |accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship-oc09/home/news/news-singleview-world-championship-2009/article/test-1.html The best coach in Europe, The Harry Potter look-alike is no wizard; simply a coaching genius], 2009-04-15, SZYMON SZEMBERG, IIHF.com.</ref>

With the NHL set to resume in [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06]], Thornton became a [[restricted free agent]] in the summer of 2005 and was reportedly unhappy with the state of the Bruins franchise, as well as the criticism of his play in the Bruins' early playoff exit in [[2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2004]].<ref name="unhappy">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=2106450 |title=ESPN - What will the new NHL look like? - NHL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |author=Scott BurnsideSpecial to ESPN.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref>  Thornton was under heavy scrutiny for his leadership style and was criticized for being unable to raise his level of play during the playoffs. Many people felt that Bruins coach [[Robbie Ftorek]] gave Thornton the captaincy too early.{{By whom|date=January 2009}} Regardless, Thornton re-signed with the team on August 11, 2005, to a three-year deal worth [[United States dollar|US$]]20 million.

While Thornton was off to a strong start production-wise (33 points in 24 games), the Bruins were struggling in the standings. On November 30, 2005, Thornton was traded to the [[San Jose Sharks]] in a four-player deal, which sent forwards [[Marco Sturm]] and [[Wayne Primeau]] and defenceman [[Brad Stuart]] to Boston in exchange for the Bruins captain.<ref name="trade-to-sj"/> Thornton was the team's leading scorer at the time by a substantial margin.

Then-Bruins general manager, Mike O'Connell, later stated in a June 2011 interview that he "would still make the trade," and that it was "satisfying" to see Boston win a Stanley Cup before Thornton's San Jose Sharks did.<ref name="o'connell">{{cite news|url=http://www.freezepage.com/1319307625YXISIFGARO|title= Felger & Mazz: Ex-GM Mike O<U+2019>Connell <U+201C>Glad<U+201D> Bruins Won Before Sharks|newspaper= CBSBoston.com|date=17 June 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> O'Connell further explained the trade by questioning Thornton's character both on and off the ice at the time, contrasting him with [[Patrice Bergeron]], who was in his second full season with the Bruins when the trade took place. O'Connell recalled making the decision with assistant general manager Jeff Gorton to alternatively build the team around Bergeron.<ref name="o'connell" /> 

[[Image:Joe Thornton - San Jose Sharks - Warmup vs Nashville.JPG|thumb|left|Thornton during a pre-game warmup in February 2007.]]

===San Jose Sharks===
Upon arriving in San Jose, Thornton improved the Sharks' fortunes and found instant chemistry with [[winger (ice hockey)|winger]] [[Jonathan Cheechoo]]. During the absence of usual [[Captain (hockey)|alternate captain]] [[Alyn McCauley]] from the San Jose lineup, Thornton donned the "A" for the first time as a Shark in a game against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] on March 30, 2006,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and wore the "A" whenever McCauley was out of the lineup for the remainder of the season.  Tallying 92 points in 58 games with the Sharks after the trade, Thornton finished the season with a league-leading 96 assists and 125 points total to earn the [[Art Ross Trophy]] as the league's top scorer. He became the first player to win the award while splitting the season between two teams.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Due to Thornton's success, Cheechoo also enjoyed a career-season, winning the [[Rocket Richard Trophy]] as the league's top goal-scorer with 56 markers. In the playoffs, however, Thornton was once again criticized for his play as his production decreased to 2 goals and 9 points in 11 games as the Sharks were ousted in the second round.  In the off-season, Thornton was honoured for his regular season play and was awarded the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as league MVP to go with his Art Ross Trophy.<ref name=MVP/>  He is the only player in NHL history to win the Hart Trophy while playing for two different teams in the same season.

Thornton began the [[2006<U+2013>07 NHL season|2006<U+2013>07 campaign]] being awarded permanent alternate captaincy, but struggled in the first half of the season while suffering from a toe injury that did not heal until January 2007.<ref name="toe-injury">{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/Joe_Thornton |title=Joe Thornton - Mahalo |publisher=Mahalo.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref>  After recovering, Thornton enjoyed a productive second half, battling Penguins superstar [[Sidney Crosby]] for a second consecutive scoring title late in the year, eventually finishing 6 points behind Crosby with 114. With a league-leading 92 assists, Thornton became only the third player in NHL history to record back-to-back 90-assist seasons, joining [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Mario Lemieux]].<ref name="the-nhl-arena">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenhlarena.com/lofiversion/index.php/t592.html |title=The NHL Arena &gt; Joe Thornton #19 |publisher=Thenhlarena.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-05}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Thornton began the 2007 playoffs by recording six assists in the Sharks' first-round series against Nashville. Advancing to the second round against the [[Detroit Red Wings]], he notched a goal and three assists in the first  three games of the series. However, Thornton was effectively neutralized by Red Wings defenceman [[Nicklas Lidstr<U+00F6>m]],<ref name="joe-nicklas">{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/playoffs/sandet?season=2006 |title=NHL - 2007 Playoffs San Jose Sharks vs. Detroit Red Wings - Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> for the remainder of the seires as the Sharks were eliminated in six games.

In the off-season, Thornton signed a three-year contract extension worth US$21.6 million that, keeping him with the Sharks until June 2011.<ref name="3-year-contract">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2922448 |title=ESPN - Three-year extension keeps Thornton in San Jose through 2011 - NHL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |author=Associated Press |date= |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> In the [[2007-08 NHL season]], Thornton finished with 96 points (29 goals and 67 assists) to finish fifth in NHL scoring. In [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09]], Thornton was named captain of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] for the [[57th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2009 NHL All-Star Game]] in [[Montreal]].<ref>[http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=264258&lid=headline&lpos=topStory_main Kovalev, Thornton named All-Star team captains]</ref> He completed the season with 86 points. In the subsequent post-season, he recorded a goal and four assists in six games as the Sharks were eliminated in the first round by the [[Anaheim Ducks]].<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=290427025]</ref>

In September 2009, before the start of the [[2009-10 NHL season]], the Sharks acquired [[Dany Heatley]] in a three-player trade that sent former Thornton's struggling linemate [[Jonathan Cheechoo]], left winger [[Milan Michalek]] and a 2nd round pick to the [[Ottawa Senators]]. Thornton, Heatley, and Sharks captain [[Patrick Marleau]] were joined on the Sharks' top line and enjoyed immediate offensive success together. The trio helped the Sharks to one of their best regular seasons in franchise history. Although the line's production slowed down in the second half of the season, all three Sharks players finished in the league's top 15 in point-scoring. Thornton's 89 points ranked eighth, while his 69 assists were second to [[Henrik Sedin]] of the Vancouver Canucks. Marleau and Heatley finished 14th and 15th in league scoring with 83 and 82 points, respectively. The Sharks entered the 2010 playoffs as the first seed in the West for the second consecutive year. After advancing past the Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings in the first two rounds, the Sharks were eliminated by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the Western Conference Finals. Thornton finished the playoffs with a career-high 12 points in 15 games.

After the elimination, team management vacated all the Sharks' captaincy positions, including Thornton's role as one of the alternate captains. Prior to the [[2010<U+2013>11 NHL season|2010<U+2013>11 season]], he was chosen to replace the retiring Rob Blake as the eighth captain in team history on October 7, 2010. Nine days later, he signed a three-year, US$21 million contract extension with the Sharks. Near the start of the 2010-11 season, Thornton scored the fourth hat trick of his NHL career against [[Martin Brodeur]] in a 5-2 win over the [[New Jersey Devils]]. In November 2010, Thornton was suspended two games for a controversial hit to the head against [[St. Louis Blues]] forward [[David Perron]]. [[David Perron]] missed the remaining 72 games of the 2010-2011 season due to post-concussion syndrome. Later in the campaign, he eclipsed Marleau as the Sharks' all-time leader in assists. Thornton scored his 1,000th career point with a goal in a game against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] on April 8, 2011.

In the [[2010-11 NHL season|2010-11 season]], Thornton scored only 70 points in 80 games, his lowest point production since the 2001-02 season, when he had 68 points in 66 games. However, he reached a new career high in playoff points with 17, notably scoring the series clinching goal in the first round against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].

===Off-ice incident===
Thornton was accused of hitting two police officers on May 17, 2003, after coming to the aid of his brother, John Thornton, at the bar Burty Bob's Two in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]]. He faced two charges of assaulting police and one of obstructing justice. Crown lawyer Kevin Gowdey announced at a court hearing he would not be pursuing the case against the Bruins captain (at the time) in return for Thornton apologizing to the parties involved and beginning a "significant period of community service." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2003/08/12/thornton_charges_ap/ |title=SI.com - Hockey - Prosecutors won&#039;t pursue charges against Joe Thornton - Tuesday August 12, 2003 12:24 PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>
