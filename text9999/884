'''Comic Fiesta''' or CF for short, is [[Malaysia]]<U+2019>s longest-running and most [[epic]] convention that focuses on [[animation]], [[comics]] and [[games]] (ACG). They take pride in celebrating all aspects of art and creativity (as well as the ever popular ACG culture), collecting all these elements in one location and unleashing this melting pot of human ingenuity to all members of society, both locally and internationally.

Responsible for ushering in the rapidly-expanding ACG community into [[Malaysia]], Comic Fiesta (CF) is proudly an event by fans for fans. This is the first and the biggest non-profit ACG convention in [[Malaysia]], organized by a group of passionate individuals brought together by one common goal, and powered by a massive [[community]] of professionals, amateurs and enthusiasts of all age groups.

== History ==
Since its humble beginnings as a small [[exhibition]] at the [[Selangor]] Chinese Assembly Hall in 2002, CF has grown exponentially in both size and scope to become the premier ACG event in [[Malaysia]]. 2011 marks the tenth anniversary of CF, set to delight close to 20,000 visitors on the 17th and 18th of December 2011, at the [[Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre]]!

In a nutshell, [[cosplay]] (a portmanteau of costume play) is a fascinating [[subculture]] where passionate fans dress up and act as their favourite character from an [[animated]] series, [[film]], [[game]], or [[literary work]]. Over a thousand passionate cosplayers have graciously lent Comic Fiesta their support throughout the years, making their event home to one of the biggest cosplay community in [[Malaysia]].
