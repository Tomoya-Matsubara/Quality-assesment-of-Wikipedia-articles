'''SS ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren''''' was a steel-hulled passenger/cargo steamship built in Norway in 1891. She served as a communications link between the regional capital of [[Western Norway]], [[Bergen]], and the various communities of [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county. 

Following the 9 April 1940 German [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|invasion of Norway]], she was requisitioned by the Norwegian authorities and carried troops for the [[Norwegian Campaign|Norwegian war effort]] until the forces in Western Norway ceased fighting on 2 May 1940.

After a brief stint in German service, she returned to her civilian duties later in 1940, and was accidentally torpedoed and sunk by a German [[E-boat]] in Bergen on 29 March 1945.

==Construction and characteristics==
''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was one of four passenger/cargo steamships built for ''[[Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe]]'' at Norwegian shipyards around the turn of the 20th century. The four ships were constructed to supplement four smaller vessels built decades earlier at British shipyards. In addition to ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'', which was seen as the flag ship of the company's fleet, ''L<U+00E6>rdal'', ''Balder'' and ''Stavenes'' were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in [[Western Norway]]. ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.<ref>Torvanger 2000, p. 30</ref><ref name=Torvanger58>Torvanger 2000, p. 58</ref>

Delivered on 30 June 1891, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was yard number 132 at ''[[Aker (company)|Akers Mekaniske V<U+00E6>rksted]]'' in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (modern-day Oslo), Norway. The steel-hulled ship displaced {{GRT|433|first=yes}}, had a length of {{convert|50.8|m|ft}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|7.5|m|ft}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|3.9|m|ft}}. Her 600 [[indicated horsepower]]/116 [[nominal horsepower]] 3-cylinder [[triple expansion steam engine]] could propel the ship at {{convert|12|kn}}.<ref name=Torvanger58/><ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=5600264|shipname=Kommandoren |accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=Warsailors>{{Cite web|last=Lawson |first =Siri Holm |url=http://www.warsailors.com/homefleetsingles/kommandoren.html |title=D/S Kommand<U+00F8>ren |accessdate=15 April 2013 |work=Warsailors.com |publisher= |date= }}</ref> ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' cost the company {{NOK|264,000}} to build and could take up to 249 passengers.<ref name=Torvanger58/>

Although much newer than the first ships operated by ''Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe'', ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' and the three other ships were only around {{convert|2|kn}} faster than the mid-19th century vessels used by the company.<ref>F<U+00F8>rsund 1998, p. 163</ref>

The new ship was named ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' by [[Nordre Bergenhus amt]] county council, after the affectionate nickname of the county's shipping company's first executive director, [[Hugo Lous]], who had held the rank of ''kommand<U+00F8>rkaptein'' ({{lang-en| [[commander]]}}) in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]].<ref>F<U+00F8>rsund 1998, p. 35</ref><ref name=Torvanger59>Torvanger 2000, p. 59</ref> To name the new ship after the executive director was an unusual decision, as most Norwegian ships of the era were named after place names, historical figures or royalty.<ref>Kolltveit 1982, p. 58</ref> 

Built not only to carry people and cargo between the towns and villages of Western Norway, but also for the tourist trade, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was fitted with a comparatively luxurious first class section. The 10-cabin, 36-bed, first class featured a smoking salon, a women's salon and a dining salon for the first class passengers and ship officers. A [[promenade deck]] gave views in all directions. The third class passengers had two salons, one on the [[main deck]] and one on the [[orlop]] (lowest) deck. On ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'', the third class section was expanded and improved in comparison with earlier vessels, after complaints from passengers to the county council.<ref name=Torvanger59/><ref>Torvanger 2000, p. 60</ref> The third class section of ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was described by the newspaper ''[[Sogns Tidende]]'' as "large, spacious and almost comfortably equipped''.<ref name=countymuni>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfj.no/cmssff/cmspublish.nsf/print/348DB9B38492862EC12578CC003D6396?OpenDocument |title=Kommand<U+00F8>ren i Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane |author=Hermund Kleppa |year=2011 |work=[[Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality]] |publisher= |accessdate=15 April 2013 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was home ported in [[Bergen]].<ref>Nordanger 1975, p. 422</ref> She had her maiden passenger voyage from Bergen to [[Sogn]] on 5 July 1891.<ref name=countymuni/>

==Passenger/cargo and tourist service==
[[File:Kommand<U+00F8>ren 1926.jpg|thumb|''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' at anchor in [[Sandane]] in 1926]]
In the summer season, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes during the winter months. ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was generally used as an express route ship, often carrying patients on their way to treatment.<ref>Torvanger 2000, pp.&nbsp;60<U+2013>61</ref> Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep.<ref>F<U+00F8>rsund 1998, p. 20</ref> During one of her trips, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' ran aground on 20 October 1900 near [[Tjugum]] in [[Balestrand]].<ref>F<U+00F8>rsund 1998, p. 106</ref> The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to [[Vik]] to inspect the area for a proposed railway project.<ref>F<U+00F8>rsund 1998, p. 115</ref> Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' provided transport support to a large-scale [[Norwegian Army]] field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from [[Gudvangen]] to [[L<U+00E6>rdals<U+00F8>yri]] after the completion of the exercises.<ref>NN 1893, p. 35</ref>

In 1910, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was modernized at ''Stavanger St<U+00F8>beri & Dok'' in [[Stavanger]], gaining a new boiler for the steam engine and being painted white. In January the next year, she ran aground at [[Rongev<U+00E6>r]] in the [[Fensfjord]]. She ran aground again in 1913, in [[Herdlefjorden]], and again in B<U+00E5>rdsundet off [[Tysnes<U+00F8>y]] in 1928.<ref name=Warsailors/><ref name=Torvanger59/><ref name=Torvanger61>Torvanger 2000, p. 61</ref> 

A rebuild in 1922 saw the ship's [[well deck]] built over, creating a flush deck profile. In 1930 the ship was refurbished and modernized.<ref name=Torvanger61/> By this time, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' displaced a total of {{GRT|543}} ({{NRT|315}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://minnehallen.no/skip_2/kommandoren-ds |title=DS.

''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' ran aground yet again in April 1938, when she ran into the island Segl<U+00F8>ya while ''en route'' from [[Skjerjehamn]] to [[Eivindvik]]. The incident caused severe damage to the bottom of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].<ref name=Warsailors/><ref name=Torvanger61/>

==Second World War==

===Norwegian Campaign===

====Troop ship====
When Norway was [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|invaded by Nazi Germany]] on 9 April, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was not in the areas immediately captured by the invading Germans. She was thus able to continue her service in the [[Sognefjord]] for much of the month of April 1940.<ref name=Torvanger61/> On 9 April 1940, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was en route to Bergen, but was stopped at [[H<U+00F8>yanger]] and ordered to Sogn to assist in the mobilization of Norwegian Army units to [[Norwegian Campaign|oppose the Germans]].<ref name=Svartefoss22>Svartefoss 1994, p. 22</ref><ref name=Torvanger62>Torvanger 2000, p. 62</ref> 

''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was directed to transport troops from [[Dingja]] via several smaller villages to [[Nordeide]] and Gudvangen. Together with the steamer {{SS|Gudvangen||2}}, she set out in the early morning of 10 April to retrieve troops.<ref name=Svartefoss22/> ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' and the other ships of the company fleet were later praised by the regional police commander for their important role in the successful mobilization in [[Sogn og Fjordane]].<ref>Svartefoss 1994, p. 23</ref>

====Bombing in the Sognefjord====
On 25 April 1940, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' steamed in the Sognefjord, carrying regular passengers, as well as a load of around 100 soldiers bound for Gudvangen and [[Voss]] for service with the Norwegian Army's [[4th Division (Norway)|4th Division]]. The soldiers brought in that day belonged to an older age group not called up in the initial mobilization drive. While ''en route'' from Vik to Balestrand, the steamer was bombed and [[Strafing|strafed]] by a German bomber. The bombs did not hit the ship, and the machine gun bullets only did minor damage and caused no casualties.<ref name=Torvanger62/><ref>Svartefoss 1994, p. 47</ref>

After calling at Balestrand, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' proceeded to [[Leikanger]], where the soldiers on board disembarked. While ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was docked at Leikanger, the village was attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'', the troops being on the march to nearby [[Hermansverk]]. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, [[restaurateur]] Isak Roksv<U+00E5>g from ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While on the way to hospital in [[L<U+00E6>rdal]] with ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'', Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.<ref name=Torvanger62/><ref>Svartefoss 1994, pp.&nbsp;48<U+2013>50</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first= |last= |authorlink= | encyclopedia=NRK Sogn og Fjordane Fylkesleksikon |title=Bombing og d<U+00F8>d p<U+00E5> Hermansverk |editor=[[Hans-Tore Bjerkaas]] |url=http://www.nrk.no/sf/leksikon/index.php/Bombing_og_d%C3%B8d_p%C3%A5_Hermansverk |accessdate=15 April 2013 | year= |publisher=[[NRK]] |location= |isbn= |pages= |language=Norwegian }}</ref>

====End of the campaign====
For the remaining week of the fighting in [[South Norway]], ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was docked at [[Kvams<U+00F8>ya]], immobilized by a damaged [[axle]].<ref name=Torvanger62/> As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was to be handed over to the Germans, along with the ferry [[MF L<U+00E6>rdal (1939)|''L<U+00E6>rdal'']] and 40 smaller boats. The transfer of the ships occurred at L<U+00E6>rdal on 2 May, and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May. The Germans used ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' and the other vessels for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway.<ref>Svartefoss 1994, pp.&nbsp;51<U+2013>54</ref>
When released by the Germans, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was repaired before re-entering service.<ref name=Warsailors/>

===During the German occupation===
By the autumn of 1940, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was back in regular service, providing an important link between Bergen and the smaller town and villages in the region.<ref name=Torvanger62/> By 1944, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' had been assigned the [[code letters]] LEGO.<ref name=Lloyds-44/>

She remained in service until 8 February 1945, when she ran aground in the [[Alverstraumen]] narrows. ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' remained aground for five weeks, and was filled by sea water before being salvaged and towed to Bergen to await repairs. Although the ship's hull was intact, the interior and engine were heavily water damaged.<ref name=Torvanger63>Torvanger 2000, p. 63</ref>

===Sinking===
During the night of 29 March 1945, ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was docked at the remains of S<U+00F8>ndre Nykirkekai in Bergen.<ref name=Warsailors/>{{#tag:ref|Most of the quay S<U+00F8>ndre Nykirkekai had been destroyed in the [[1944 V<U+00E5>gen explosion]] less than a year previously.<ref name=Torvanger51>Torvanger 2000, p. 51</ref>|group=Note}} At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat anchored on the opposite side of [[V<U+00E5>gen, Bergen|V<U+00E5>gen]] bay.<ref>Voks<U+00F8> 1994, p. 511</ref> The torpedo explosion threw debris from ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water.<ref name=Torvanger51/> The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, [[Able Seaman]] Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.<ref name=Torvanger63/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first= |last= |authorlink= | encyclopedia=NRK Sogn og Fjordane Fylkesleksikon |title=Alf H.

Before discovering that the incident had been caused by the accidental launch of two torpedoes by a drunken German crewman on the [[E-boat]] ''S-13'', the German authorities in Bergen launched a search for saboteurs in the city.<ref name=Warsailors/><ref name=Torvanger63/> ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was the only total loss suffered by ''Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane'' (the formerly named ''Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe'') during the Second World War.<ref name=Torvanger63/>

The wreck of ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was raised in April 1946 and towed to [[Kj<U+00F8>kkelvik]] in [[Ask<U+00F8>y]]. ''Kommand<U+00F8>ren'' was sold for scrap in November 1946.<ref name=Warsailors/><ref name=Torvanger63/>
