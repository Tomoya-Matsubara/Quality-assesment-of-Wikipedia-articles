'''''Diary of a Camper''''' is a short 1996 [[cinema of the United States|American film]] made using [[id Software]]'s 1996 [[first-person shooter]] [[video game|computer game]] ''[[Quake]]''. It was created  by [[United Ranger Films]], then a subdivision of a popular group of computer game players, or [[clan (gaming)|clan]], known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the [[Internet]] as a non-interactive [[game demo]] file. The video is generally considered<ref>{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=6}}; {{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=32}}; {{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=28}}</ref> the first known example of [[machinima]]<U+2014>the art of using real-time, virtual 3-D environments, often [[game engine]]s, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone [[camping (computer gaming)|camper]] (a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle) who faces five members of the Rangers clan in a [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]], a type of [[multiplayer game]] in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.

Although players had previously recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or [[speedrun]]s, attempts to complete a [[level (computer and video games)|map]] as quickly as possible. ''Diary of a Camper'' was the first demo to contain a narrative with (text-based) dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.

==Synopsis==
''Diary of a Camper'' occurs entirely within the ''Quake'' map DM6 ("The Dark Zone"). After exploring some of the area, the Rangers gather and decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. Shortly after they teleport into the room, the camper waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers<U+2014>ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member<U+2014>realize their comrades' fate and return fire from a distance, killing the camper. Examining the [[gibs|remains]], they identify their foe as [[John Romero]].<ref name="Brown">{{harvnb|Brown|1996}}</ref>

==Precedent and new ground==
''Diary of a Camper'' built on the ability to record gameplay, which first appeared in id Software's [[1993 in video gaming|1993 computer game]] ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]''. Using this feature, players could efficiently record game events, rather than the rendered video itself, and later replay them in real-time through the game engine.<ref name="Marino 3">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=3}}</ref> ''Doom''{{'}}s successor, ''Quake'', offered new opportunities for both gameplay and customization,<ref name="Lowood 12">{{harvnb|Lowood|2005|loc=12}}</ref> while preserving the demo recording ability.<ref name="Marino 4">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=4}}</ref> In the book ''Machinima'', Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd stated that multiplayer games became popular, almost a sport, and demo files of matches were recorded and studied.<ref name="Kelland 28">{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|loc=28}}</ref> [[Paul Marino]], executive director of the [[Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences]] (AMAS), used a different analogy: "Players began to record deathmatches with a more cinematic flair.... ''[T]he viewpoint of the player became the viewpoint of a director.''"<ref name="Marino 4 emnph">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=4}}, emphasis in original</ref>

Well-known for their playing skill and their ability to program [[mod (computer gaming)|game modifications]],<ref name="Lowood 32">{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=32}}</ref> the Rangers conceived the idea to use ''Quake'' for filmmaking in August 1996<ref name="Salen, 550">{{harvnb|Salen|Zimmerman|2003|loc=550}}</ref> and released ''Diary of a Camper'' on October 26, 1996.<ref name="Marino 21">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=21}}</ref> The group's new demo surprised the ''Quake'' community by exploiting the game differently. According to Henry Lowood, ''Diary of a Camper'' contains the action and gore of previous gameplay demos, but in the context of a simple story<ref name="Lowood 32" /> instead of the usual deathmatch.<ref name="Kelland 28" /> A ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' article compared the events of the film to those of a typical deathmatch.<ref name="Future of Machinima, 1">{{harvnb|McGraw<U+2013>Hill|2007|loc=1}}</ref> Like many of its predecessors, the demo was recorded in ''Quake''{{'}}s networked multiplayer deathmatch mode, but "it marked the transition from sports footage to moviemaking. The players were choreographed like actors, ... delivering their lines as plain text...."<ref name="Kelland 28" /> Lowood stated that "''Diary of a Camper'' breaks with the demo movie as documented gameplay" because the spectator's perspective is independent "from that of any player/actor; the movie is not 'shot' from the first-person perspective of the shooter."<ref name="Lowood 33">{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=33}}</ref> Lowood called the film a "transformation of competitive play to ... minimal theatrical play", emphasized through the inclusion of references to gameplay, such as the camper.<ref name="Lowood 13">{{harvnb|Lowood|2005|loc=13}}</ref>

Before ''Diary of a Camper''{{'}}s release, Uwe Girlich, a German doctoral candidate,<ref name="Kelland 37">{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=37}}</ref> had documented the ''Quake'' demo file format, in which "the player coordinates and camera positions may be different".<ref name="Lowood 33" /> He added that "for people with too much spare-time ''Quake'' can replace a full 3D modelling system".<ref name ="Lowood 33" /> However, the Rangers developed ''Diary of a Camper'' before any demo-editing software tools had been publicly released; clan member Eric "ArchV" Fowler instead created his own tools to reposition the camera and to splice recorded footage.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=33}}; {{harvnb|Wu|n.d.}}</ref> As with all of United Ranger Films' productions, Heath "ColdSun" Brown wrote the story, and Matt "Unknown Soldier" Van Sickler was the director.<ref>{{harvnb|Wu|n.d.}}</ref> In the release notes, Brown credits clan members Chris "Sphinx" Birke<ref>Real name established in {{harvnb|Salen|2002}}</ref> and Mute with helping Fowler with "movie packaging".<ref name="Brown notes">{{harvnb|Brown|1996|loc=release notes}}</ref>

''Diary of a Camper'' and the films that it inspired were initially called "''Quake'' movies"; the term ''machinima'' was later coined in 1998,<ref name="Marino 1">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=1}}</ref> in response to the increasing use of other game engines.<ref name="Marino 12">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=12}}</ref> There was initial hesitance to retroactively label ''Diary of a Camper'' the first machinima piece; a [[Machinima.com]] article from January 2000 opened, "It's kinda hard to pin down the first Machinima: things like the Doom speedruns, the [[Stunt Island]] stuff and the [[demoscene|Demo Scene]] all compete for the title. However, it's a lot easier to pin down the first piece of film made in a 3D game engine: Diary Of A Camper".<ref name="Machinima.com staff 2000">{{harvnb|Machinima.com staff|2000|Ref=CITEREFMachinima.com2000}}</ref> Marino states that the AMAS carefully defined machinima in 2002 as "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment" to separate machinima from its creative lineage.<ref name="Marino 1" /> Separating machinima from the demoscene and earlier demo recordings, he defines ''Diary of a Camper'' as the first machinima work.<ref name="Marino 4-6">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=4<U+2013>6}}</ref> Lowood also contrasts the film with earlier recordings of "documented gameplay".<ref name="Lowood 32-22">{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=32<U+2013>33}}</ref>

==Reception==
Despite ''Diary of a Camper''{{'}}s importance in establishing machinima, commentators have criticized the film's actual content. Marino called the plot "simple";<ref name="Marino 6">{{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=6}}</ref> likewise, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd believed that "it wasn't much of a story",<ref name="Kelland 28" /> and Lowood wrote that "the plot offers little more than a brief sequence of inside jokes".<ref name="Lowood 33" /> Among major ''Quake'' movie review sites,<ref>As listed in {{harvnb|Marino|2004|loc=7}}</ref> Roger Matthews of the ''Quake'' Movie Library called the film "not much more than a deathmatch with a camera".<ref name="QML">{{harvnb|Matthews|1997}}</ref> On Psyk's Popcorn Jungle, Paul Coates wrote, "This movie is ''dull''. It is ''not very interesting''."<ref name="Coates emph">{{harvnb|Coates|1998|emphasis in original}}</ref> Stephen Lum of The Cineplex said that the film contained "weird humour".<ref name="Cineplex">{{harvnb|Lum|n.d.}}</ref>

Although ''Quake'' movie critics found shortcomings in ''Diary of a Camper'', they mentioned positive aspects, including the work's novelty; however, their final ratings varied. Matthews wrote that "the camera work was very nice and never once screwed up",<ref name="QML" /> and Lum gave the film "a perfect 10 for Innovation/Originality because [it] started the Quake Movie craze".<ref name="Cineplex" /> Of the major ''Quake'' movie review sites, only The Cineplex gave ''Diary'' a good rating overall, 7.5 out of 10.<ref name="Cineplex" /> Matthews and Coates rated the film 20% out of 100%<ref name="QML" /> and 2 out of 10,<ref name="Coates">{{harvnb|Coates|1998}}</ref> respectively. Later, Coates updated his review, saying, "I feel I overreacted at the fact that DoaC was old. It's the first ''ever'' Quake movie. I have to give the Rangers massive credit for that.... But, by today's standards, the rating seems to fit."<ref name="Coates emph" />

Because of its significance, ''Diary of a Camper'' continues to be featured in machinima presentations. In a 2005 event at [[Stanford University]], the film was presented with later machinima works, such as ''[[Red vs. Blue]]''.<ref name="Lue">{{harvnb|Lue|2005}}</ref> Likewise, the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] included it in a machinima exhibit that ended on July 16, 2006.<ref>{{harvnb|Marino|2006}}; {{harvnb|Butler|2006}}</ref>
