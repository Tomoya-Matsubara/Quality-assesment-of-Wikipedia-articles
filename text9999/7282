The '''Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoise''' or '''Gal<U+00E1>pagos [[giant tortoise]]''' (''Chelonoidis nigra'') is the largest living species of [[tortoise]] and [[Largest organisms#Reptiles (Reptilia)|13th-heaviest living reptile]], reaching weights of over {{convert|400|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} and lengths of over {{convert|1.8|m|ft|sp=us}}. With life spans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived [[vertebrates]]. A captive individual lived at least 170&nbsp;years.

The tortoise is native to seven of the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]], a volcanic [[archipelago]] about {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on|-1}} west of the [[Ecuador]]ian mainland. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish ''gal<U+00E1>pago'', meaning [[tortoise]].

Shell size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks&nbsp;- on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with "saddleback" shells and long necks. [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] observations of these differences on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] in 1835, contributed to the [[Evolution|development of his theory of evolution]].

Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by exploitation of the species for meat and oil, [[Habitat destruction|habitat clearance]] for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. Ten [[Subspecies of Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoise|subspecies]] of the original fifteen survive in the wild; an eleventh subspecies (''[[Chelonoidis nigra abingdoni|C.&nbsp;n.&nbsp;abingdonii]]'') had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed [[Lonesome George]] until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and it is estimated that the total number of the species exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, the species as a whole is classified as "vulnerable" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).

;Recognition of subpopulations
The first systematic survey of giant tortoises was by [[Albert G<U+00FC>nther]] of the [[British Museum]], in 1875.<ref name='G1875'/> G<U+00FC>nther identified at least five distinct populations from the Gal<U+00E1>pagos, and three from the Indian Ocean islands. He expanded the list in 1877 to six from the Gal<U+00E1>pagos, four from the [[Seychelles]], and four from the [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarenes]]. G<U+00FC>nther theorised that all the giant tortoises descended from a single ancestral population which spread by sunken [[land bridge]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00FC>nther|1877|p=9}}</ref> This theory was later disproven by the understanding that the Gal<U+00E1>pagos, Seychelles and Mascarene islands are all of recent volcanic origin and have never been linked by land bridges. It is now thought that the Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoises descended from a South American ancestor,<ref name='Caccone 1999'/> while the Indian Ocean tortoises derived from Madagascar.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Austin |first=Jeremy|coauthors=Arnold, E.

Previously, the Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoise was considered to belong to the genus ''[[Geochelone]]'', known as 'typical tortoises' or 'terrestrial turtles'. In the 1990s, subgenus ''[[Chelonoidis]]'' was elevated to generic status based on [[phylogenetic]] evidence which grouped the South American members of ''Geochelone'' into an independent [[clade]] (branch of the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]).<ref name = "Le et al.">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.03.003 |url = http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Articles/Le_etal_2006.pdf |last=Le |first=Minh |coauthors=Raxworthy, Christopher J.; McCord, William P.; Mertz, Lisa |year=2006 |title=A molecular phylogeny of tortoises (Testudines:Testudinidae) based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes |journal=[[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=517<U+2013>531 |pmid=16678445 }}</ref> This nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities.<ref name='iucnredlist.org'>{{IUCN2009.2|assessors=Tortoise & Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group |year=1996 |id=9011 |title=Chelonoidis nigra |downloaded=2012-01-11}}</ref><ref name='R2010'/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.vertebrate-zoology.de/vz57-2/57-2_Fritz_149-368.pdf |last1=Fritz |first1=U. |last2=Hava<U+0161>|first2=P.|year=2007|title=Checklist of Chelonians of the World|journal=Vertebrate Zoology|volume=57|issue=2|pages=149<U+2013>368

==Evolutionary history==
All [[subspecies of Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoise]] evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland South America by overwater [[biological dispersal|dispersal]]. The minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair.<ref name='Caccone 1999'/> Survival on the 1000&nbsp;km oceanic journey is accounted for by the fact that the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water.<ref name = "Le et al."/> As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the [[Humboldt Current]], which diverts westwards towards the Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands from the mainland.<ref name='ReferenceA'/> The ancestors of the genus ''[[Chelonoidis]]'' are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the [[Oligocene]].<ref name = "Le et al."/>

===Subspecies genetics===
[[File:Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoise Santa Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoise (''Chelonoidis nigra porteri'') feeding on Santa Cruz Island]]
Modern [[molecular phylogenetics|DNA methods]] have revealed new information on the relationships between the subspecies:

;Isabela Island
The five populations living on the largest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most debate as to whether they are true subspecies or just distinct populations. It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate subspecies.<ref name='Caccone 1999'/> It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf subspecies (''C. n. becki'') while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.<ref name='Caccone 1999'/> It is thought that tortoises from Santa Cruz first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (''C. n. guentheri'') and therefore form the subspecies ''C. n. vandenburghi'' (Alcedo) and ''C. n. microphyes'' (Darwin).<ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727<U+2013>1744">{{cite journal|author=Ciofi, Claudio; Wilson, Gregory A.; Beheregaray, Luciano B.; Marquez, Cruz; Gibbs, James P.; Tapia, Washington; Snell, Howard L.; Caccone, Adalgisa; Powell, Jeffrey R.|year=2006|title=Phylogeographic history and gene flow among giant Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoises on southern Isabela Island |journal= Genetics| volume =172|issue=3|pages=1727<U+2013>1744|doi=10.1534/genetics.105.047860|pmid=16387883|pmc=1456292}}</ref> The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (''C. n. vicina'') is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.<ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727<U+2013>1744"/> Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers they are all genetically different and should each be considered a separate subspecies.<ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727<U+2013>1744"/>

==Description==
The tortoises have a large bony [[carapace]] (shell) of a dull brown colour. The plates of the shell are fused with the ribs in a rigid protective structure that is integral to the skeleton.

Galap<U+00E1>gos tortoises are the only lineage of giant tortoise exhibiting different types of shell shape.<ref name='Chiari 2009'/> They exhibit a spectrum of carapace morphology ranging from "saddleback" (denoting upward arching of the front edge of the shell resembling a saddle) to "domed" (denoting a rounded convex surface resembling a dome). When saddleback tortoises withdraw their head and forelimbs into their shells, a large unprotected gap remains over their neck, evidence of the lack of predation during the evolution of this structure. There is no saddleback/domed dualism, as tortoises can be of intermediate type with characteristics of both.

;Evolutionary implications
In combination with proportionally longer necks and limbs,<ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'/> the unusual saddleback carapace structure is thought to be an adaptation to increase vertical reach, which enables the tortoise to browse tall vegetation such as the ''[[Opuntia]]'' (prickly pear) cactus that grows in arid environments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=E.Y.|year=1966|chapter=Cacti in the Gal<U+00E1>pagos islands, with special reference to their relations with tortoises|editor-last=Bowman|editor-first=R.I|title=The Gal<U+00E1>pagos|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=209<U+2013>214|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f8T3Dl5tokYC&pg=PA209}}</ref> Saddlebacks are more territorial<ref name='I.

A competing hypothesis is that, rather than being principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities might have been a [[Secondary sex characteristics|secondary sexual characteristic]] of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size<ref name='Fritts 1984'/> ([[#Reproduction|see below]]).

===Diet===
[[File:Galapagos giant tortoise feeding.jpg|right|thumb|left|alt=An adult tortoise with a mouthful of green leaves.|A tortoise feeding]]
The tortoises are [[herbivore]]s that consume a diet of cacti, grasses, leaves, lichens, and berries. They have been documented feeding on ''[[Manchineel tree|Hippomane mancinella]]'' ('poison apple'), the endemic [[guava]] ''Psidium galapageium'', the [[Mosquito fern|water fern]] ''Azolla microphylla'', and the [[Tillandsia|bromeliad]] ''Tillandsia insularis''.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Cayot|first=Linda Jean |year=1987| title=Ecology of giant tortoises (''Geochelone elephantopus'') in the Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=Syracuse University |location=Syracuse}}</ref> A tortoise eats an average of {{convert|32|<U+2013>|36|kg|-1}} per day{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}, with a digestive efficiency roughly equal to that of hindgut fermenting herbivorous mammals such as horses and rhinos.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hatt|first=Jean-Michel|coauthors=Class, Marcus; Gisler, Ricarda; Liesegang, Annette; Wanner, Marcel|year=2005|title=Fiber digestibility in juvenile Galapagos tortoises (''Geochelone nigra'') and implications for the development of captive animals |journal=Zoo Biology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=185<U+2013>191|doi=10.1002/zoo.20039}}</ref>

Tortoises acquire most of their moisture from the dew and sap in vegetation (particularly the ''[[Opuntia]]'' cactus); therefore, they can survive long periods without water. They can endure 18 months when deprived of all food and water,<ref name='Porter 1815'>{{cite book|last=Porter|first=David|year=1815|title=Journal of the cruise made to the Pacific Ocean by Captain Porter in the United States Frigate Essex in the years 1812, 1813, 1814|location=New York |page=151 |publisher=Wiley & Halsted |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IiYFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA151}}</ref> surviving by breaking down their body fat to produce water as a by-product. When thirsty they may drink large quantities of water very quickly, storing it in their bladders and the "root of the neck" (the [[pericardium]]<ref name='Swingland 1989'/>), both of which served to make them useful water sources on ships.<ref name='Porter 1815'/> On arid islands, tortoises lick morning dew from boulders, and the repeated action over many generations has formed half-sphere depressions in the rock.<ref name='Swingland 1989'/>

===Senses===
Regarding their senses, Charles Darwin observed that: "The inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf; certainly they do not overhear a person walking near behind them. I was always amused, when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it would draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead."<ref name='D1839'/> Although they are not deaf,<ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'/> tortoises depend far more on vision and smell as stimuli than hearing.<ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/>

===Mutualism===
Tortoises share a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with some species of [[Darwin's finches|Gal<U+00E1>pagos finch]] and mockingbirds. Small groups of finches initiate the process by hopping on the ground in an exaggerated fashion facing the tortoise. The tortoise signals it is ready by rising up and extending its neck and legs, enabling the birds to reach otherwise inaccessible spots on the tortoise's body such as the neck, rear legs, [[cloaca]]l opening, and skin between plastron and carapace. The birds benefit from the food source and the tortoises get rid of irritating [[ectoparasite]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=MacFarland |first=Craig G. |coauthors=Reeder, W.G. |year=1974 |title=Cleaning symbiosis involving Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoises and two species of Darwin's finches|journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Tierpsychologie |volume=34 |pages=464<U+2013>483 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1974.tb01816.x |issue=5 }}</ref>

Some tortoises have been observed to insidiously exploit this mutualistic relationship. After rising and extending its limbs, the bird may go beneath the tortoise to investigate, whereupon suddenly the tortoise withdraws its limbs to drop flat and kill the bird. It then steps back to eat the bird, presumably to supplement its diet with protein.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bonin|first= Franck|coauthors=Devaux, Bernard; Dupr<U+00E9>, Alain |year=2006 |title=Turtles of the world |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-8496-9|others=Pritchard, Peter Charles Howard}}</ref>

[[File:Galapagos dominance display.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two tortoises with their necks extended.|A pair of tortoises engaging in a dominance display]]

===Mating===
[[Mating]] occurs at any time of the year, although it does have seasonal peaks between February and June in the humid uplands during the rainy season.<ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/> When mature males meet in the mating season they will face each other in a ritualised dominance display, rise up on their legs and stretch up their necks with their mouths gaping open. Occasionally, head-biting occurs, but usually the shorter tortoise will back off, conceding mating rights to the victor. The behaviour is most pronounced in saddleback subspecies, which are more aggressive and have longer necks.<ref name='Schafer and Krekorian 1983'/>

The prelude to mating can be very aggressive, as the male forcefully rams the female's shell with his own and nips her legs.<ref name="DS1930"/> Mounting is an awkward process and the male must stretch and tense to maintain equilibrium in a slanting position. The concave underside of the male's shell helps him to balance when straddled over the female's shell, and brings his cloacal vent (which houses the penis) closer to the female's dilated cloaca. During mating, the male vocalises with hoarse bellows and grunts,<ref name='Carpenter 1966'/> described as "rhythmic groans".<ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/> This is one of the few vocalisations the tortoise makes; other noises are made during aggressive encounters, when struggling to right themselves, and hissing as they withdraw into their shells due to the forceful expulsion of air.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Floyd E.|coauthors=Beaman, Kent R.

The width of the tortoise is only marginally wider than the egg.|A young tortoise and a tortoise egg]]

===Egg-laying===
Females journey up to several kilometres in July to November to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy coast. Nest digging is a tiring and elaborate task which may take the female several hours a day over many days to complete.<ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/> It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} deep cylindrical hole, in which the tortoise then lays up to sixteen spherical, hard-shelled eggs ranging from {{convert|82|to|157|g}} in mass,<ref name='Swingland 1989'/> and the size of a billiard ball.<ref name='MacFarland 1972'/> Some observations suggest that the average [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size for domed populations (9.6&nbsp;per clutch for ''porteri'' on Santa Cruz) is larger than that of saddlebacks (4.6&nbsp;per clutch for ''duncanensis'' on Pinz<U+00F3>n).<ref name='MacFarland 1974'/> The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine, seals the nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron, and leaves them to be incubated by the sun. Females may lay 1<U+2013>4 clutches per season. [[Temperature-dependent sex determination|Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchlings]], with lower temperature nests producing more males and higher temperature nests producing more females. This is related closely to incubation time, since clutches laid early will incubate during the cool season and have longer incubation periods (producing more males), while eggs that are laid later incubate for a shorter period in the hot season (producing more females).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cio<U+FB01> |first=Claudio |coauthors=Swingland, Ian R. |year=1995 |title=Environmental sex determination in reptiles |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(96)01108-2 |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=251<U+2013>265}}</ref>

The [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Hawk]] was formerly the sole native predator of the tortoise hatchlings;  Darwin wrote: "The young tortoises, as soon as they are hatched, fall prey in great numbers to the buzzard".<ref name='D1839'/> The hawk is now much rarer, but introduced feral pigs, dogs, cats and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises.<ref name='Cayot 1994'/> The adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans; Darwin noted: "The old ones seem generally to die from accidents, as from falling down precipices. At least several of the inhabitants told me, they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause".<ref name='D1839'/>

Sex can be determined only when the tortoise is about 15&nbsp;years old, and [[sexual maturity]] is reached at around 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;years in captivity, possibly 40&nbsp;years in the wild (when they reach their full size).

==Darwin's development of theory of evolution==

Charles Darwin visited the Gal<U+00E1>pagos for five weeks on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']] in 1835 and saw Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoises on San Cristobal (Chatham) and Santiago (James) Islands.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Grant|first1=K.T.|last2=Estes|first2=G.B.|year=2009|title=Darwin in Galapagos: footsteps to a new world|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-14210-4}}</ref> They appeared several times in his writings and journals, and played a role in the development of the theory of evolution.

Darwin wrote in his account of the voyage:
<blockquote>"I have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the natural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My attention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, Mr. Lawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought&nbsp;... The inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the tortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in size, but in other characters. Captain Porter has described* those from Charles and from the nearest island to it, namely, Hood Island, as having their shells in front thick and turned up like a Spanish saddle, while the tortoises from James Island are rounder, blacker, and have a better taste when cooked."<ref name='Darwin p393'>{{cite book |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=F14&pageseq=406 |last=Darwin |first=C.R. |year=1845 |title=Journal of researches into the natural history and geology of the countries visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle round the world, under the Command of Capt. Fitz Roy |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=John Murray |pages=393<U+2013>394}}</ref> </blockquote>

The significance of the differences in tortoises between islands did not strike him as important until it was too late, as he continued,
<blockquote>"I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement, and I had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted".<ref name='Darwin p393'/></blockquote>

Even though the ''Beagle'' departed from the Gal<U+00E1>pagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck, these weren't for scientific study but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing. Their shells and bones were thrown overboard, leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=51}}</ref> It has been suggested<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|2006||p=62}}</ref> that this oversight was made because Darwin only reported seeing tortoises on San Crist<U+00F3>bal<ref name='D456'>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1839|p=456}}</ref> (''chathamensis'') and Santiago<ref>{{cite book |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=F1925&pageseq=394 |last=Keynes |first=R.D. |year=2001 |title=Charles Darwin's Beagle diary |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-00317-2 |page=362}}</ref> (''darwini''), both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other. Though he did visit Floreana, the ''nigra'' subspecies found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals.<ref name=sulloway/>

[[File:HMS Beagle 1832 longitudinal section larger.jpg|thumb|Line drawing of the HMS ''Beagle'' by F. G. King, a colleague of Darwin's. Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoises were stacked in the lower hold]]
However, Darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands. These were pet tortoises taken by himself (from San Salvador), his captain [[Robert FitzRoy|FitzRoy]] (two from Espa<U+00F1>ola) and his servant [[Syms Covington]] (from Floreana).<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=41}}</ref> Unfortunately they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=52}}</ref> Although the British Museum had a few specimens, their provenance within the Gal<U+00E1>pagos was unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00FC>nther|1877|p=62 for example}}</ref> However, conversations with the naturalist [[Gabriel Bibron]], who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that there were distinct varieties.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=CUL-DAR118.-&pageseq=41|last=Darwin|first=C.R.|year=1827; 1828<U+2013>1829; 1837<U+2013>1839|title=Edinburgh notebook|volume=CUL-DAR118|page=99}}</ref>

Darwin later compared the different tortoise forms with those of [[mockingbird]]s, in the first<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=47}}</ref> tentative statement linking his observations from the Galapagos with the possibility of species transmuting:
<blockquote>"When I recollect the fact that [from] the form of the body, shape of scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought; when I see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure and filling the same place in nature; I must suspect they are only varieties&nbsp;... If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks, the zoology of archipelagos will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of species."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=F1577&pageseq=64|last=Barlow|first=N.|year=1963|title=Darwin's ornithological notes|journal=Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History). Historical Series|volume=2|issue=7|page=262}}</ref></blockquote>

His views on the mutability of species were restated in his notebooks: "animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances.&nbsp;<U+2013> Now Galapagos Tortoises, Mocking birds, Falkland Fox, Chiloe fox,&nbsp;<U+2013> Inglish and Irish Hare."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&pageseq=9|last=Darwin|first=C.R.|year=1837<U+2013>1838|title=Notebook B: <nowiki>[Transmutation of species]</nowiki>|page=7}}</ref>  These observations served as counterexamples to the prevailing contemporary view that species were individually created.

Darwin also found these "antediluvian animals"<ref name='D456'/> to be a source of diversion: "I frequently got on their backs, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their shells, they would rise up and walk away;<U+2014>but I found it very difficult to keep my balance".<ref name='D1839'/>

==Conservation==
Several waves of human exploitation of the tortoises as a food source caused a decline in the total wild population from around 250,000<ref name="amnh.org"/> when first discovered in the 16th century to a low of 3,060 individuals in a 1974 census. Modern conservation efforts have subsequently brought tortoise numbers up to 19,317 (estimate for 1995<U+2013>2009).<ref name='galapagospark.org'>{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagospark.org/nophprg.php?page=parque_nacional_nativas_endemicas_tortugas |publisher=Galapagos National Park |title=Reproduction, breeding, repatriation, and monitoring of tortoises |date=29 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref>

The subspecies ''C.&nbsp;n.&nbsp;nigra'' became extinct by human exploitation in the 19th century. Another subspecies, ''[[Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii|C.&nbsp;n.&nbsp;abingdonii]]'', became extinct on 24 June 2012 with the death in captivity of the last remaining specimen, a male named Lonesome George, the world's "rarest living creature".<ref>{{cite book |last=Footman |first=T. |year=2000 |title=Guinness World Records 2001 |publisher=Guinness Records |isbn=0-85112-102-0 |page=182}}</ref> All the other surviving subspecies are listed by the IUCN as at least "Vulnerable" in conservation status, if not worse.

===Historical exploitation===
An estimated 200,000 animals were taken before the 20th century.<ref name='Swingland 1989'/> The relatively immobile and defenceless tortoises were collected and stored live on board ships, where they could survive for at least a year without food or water (some anecdotal reports suggest individuals surviving two years<ref name='Townsend 1925'/>), providing valuable fresh meat, while their diluted urine and the water stored in their neck bags could be used as drinking water. The 17th century British pirate, explorer and naturalist [[William Dampier]] wrote that "They are so extraordinarily large and fat, and so sweet, that no pullet eats more pleasantly,"<ref>{{cite book|last=Dampier|first=William|year=2007|origyear=1697|title=A new voyage around the world|publisher=Dover Publications |location=Dampier|chapter=Chapter 5|url=http://www.galapagos.to/TEXTS/DAMPIER-1.HTM#galapagos|isbn=978-1-933698-04-5}}</ref> while Captain [[James Colnett]] of the British Navy wrote of "the land tortoise which in whatever way it was dressed, was considered by all of us as the most delicious food we had ever tasted."<ref>{{cite book |last=Colnett|first=J. |origyear=1798 |title=A voyage to the south Atlantic |year=1968 |page=158 |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cihm_33242#page/n195/mode/2up |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=USA}}</ref> US Navy captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] declared that, "after once tasting the Gallipagos tortoises, every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation&nbsp;... The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion, and a quantity of it, exceeding that of any other food, can be eaten without experiencing the slightest of inconvenience."<ref name='Porter 1815'/> Darwin was less enthusiastic about the meat, writing "the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do "carne con cuero"), with the flesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent."<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1839|p=459}}</ref>

In the 17th century, [[pirate]]s started to use the Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands as a base for resupply, restocking on food and water and repairing vessels before attacking [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]] on the South American mainland. However, the Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoises did not struggle for survival at this point because the islands were distant from busy shipping routes and harboured few valuable natural resources. As such, they remained unclaimed by any nation, uninhabited and uncharted. In comparison, the tortoises of the islands in the Indian Ocean were already facing extinction by the late 17th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=85}}</ref>

Between the 1790s and the 1860s, [[whaling]] ships and [[Fur seal#Exploitation|fur-sealers]] systematically collected tortoises in far greater numbers than the buccaneers preceding them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=94}}</ref> Some were used for food and many more were killed for high grade "turtle oil" from the late 19th century onward for lucrative sale to continental Ecuador.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beck, RH. |year=1903 |title=In the home of the giant tortoise |journal=7th Annual Report of the New York Zoological Society |location=New York |pages=1<U+2013>17 }}</ref> A total of over 13,000 tortoises is recorded in the logs of whaling ships between 1831 and 1868, and an estimated 100,000 were taken before 1830.<ref name='Townsend 1925'>{{cite journal|last= Townsend|first=Charles Haskins|year= 1925|title=The Galapagos tortoises in their relation to the whaling industry: a study of old logbooks|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~ttyler/ploughboy/townsendgaltort.htm|journal= Zoologica|volume=4|pages=55<U+2013>135}}</ref> Since it was easiest to collect tortoises around coastal zones, females were most vulnerable to depletion during the nesting season. The collection by whalers came to a halt eventually through a combination of, the scarcity of tortoises that they had created, and the competition from crude oil as a cheaper energy source.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=104}}</ref>

Population decline accelerated with the early settlement of the islands in the early 19th century, leading to unregulated hunting for meat, habitat clearance for agriculture and the introduction of alien mammal species.<ref name='MacFarland 1974'/> Feral pigs, dogs, cats and [[black rat]]s have become predators of eggs and young tortoises, whilst goats, donkeys and cattle compete for grazing and trample nest sites. The extinction of the Floreana subspecies in the mid-19th century has been attributed to the combined pressures of hunting for the penal colony on the relatively small island, the conversion of the grazing highlands into land for farming and fruit plantations, and the introduction of feral mammals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoeck |first=H.N.|year=1984 |chapter=Introduced fauna |editor-last=Perry |editor-first=R |title=Key environments.

Scientific collection expeditions took 661 tortoises between 1888 and 1930, and more than 120 tortoises have been taken by poachers since 1990. Threats continue today with the rapid expansion of the tourist industry and increasing size of human settlements on the islands.<ref>{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Graham |coauthors=Cruz, Felipe |year=2007 |title=Galapagos at risk: a socioeconomic analysis |url=http://www.darwinfoundation.org/english/_upload/Galapagos_At-Risk-2007.pdf |publisher=Charles Darwin Foundation}}</ref>

In 1936 the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species. In 1959, it declared all uninhabited areas in the Gal<U+00E1>pagos to be a [[National Park]]<ref>Ecuador (1959). (In Spanish). ''Decreto ley de emergencia, por el cual se declaran parques nacionales de reserva de exclusivo dominio del estado, para la preservaci<U+00F3>n de la fauna y flora, todas las tierras que forman las islas del Archipi<U+00E9>lago de Col<U+00F3>n o Gal<U+00E1>pagos, Registro Oficial No. 873 (1959) Quito, 20 de Julio, 1959''</ref> and established the [[Charles Darwin Foundation]]. In 1970, capturing or removing many species from the islands (including tortoises and their eggs) was banned.<ref>Ecuador (1970). (In Spanish). ''Ley de Protecci<U+00F3>n de la Fauna Silvestre y de los Recursos Ictiol<U+00F3>gicos, Registro Oficial No. 104 (1970) Quito, 20 de Noviembre 1970''</ref> To halt trade in the tortoises altogether, it became illegal to export the tortoises from Ecuador, captive or wild, continental or insular in provenance. The banning of their exportation resulted in automatic prohibition of importation to the United States under Public Law 91-135 (1969).<ref>United States 1969. ''Endangered Species Conservation Act.'' 83 Stat. 275; 16 USC 668 cc-1 to 668 cc-6 (1969)</ref> A 1971 Ecuadorian decree made it illegal to damage, remove, alter or disturb any organism, rock or other natural object in the National Park.<ref>Ecuador (1971). (In Spanish). ''Decreto Supremo No. 1306 (1971) Quito, 27 de Agosto 1971''</ref>

;Captive breeding
Breeding and release programs began in 1965 and have successfully brought seven of the eight endangered subspecies up to less perilous population levels. Young tortoises are raised at several breeding centres across the islands to improve their survival during their vulnerable early development. Eggs are collected from threatened nesting sites, and the hatched young are given a head start by being kept in captivity for four to five years to reach a size with a much better chance of survival to adulthood, before release onto their native ranges.<ref name='Cayot 1994'>{{cite book|last=Cayot |first=L.J. |year=1994 |title=Captive management and conservation of amphibians and reptiles|pages=297<U+2013>305|location=Ithaca |publisher=Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles |journal=Contributions to Herpetology |volume=11 |isbn=0-916984-33-8}}</ref><ref name="galapagospark.org"/>

The most significant population recovery was that of the Espa<U+00F1>ola Tortoise (''hoodensis''), which was saved from near-certain extinction. The population had been depleted to 3 males and 12 females that had been so widely dispersed that no [[mating in the wild]] had occurred.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Corley Smith|first= G.T.|year=1977 |title=The present status of the giant tortoise ''Geochelone elephantopus'' on the Galapagos islands |journal=International Zoo Yearbook |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=109<U+2013>112 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-1090.1977.tb00877.x }}</ref> The 15 remaining tortoises were brought to the [[Charles Darwin Research Station]] in 1971 for a captive breeding program<ref>{{cite web |last=Caporaso |first=Fred |year=1991 |title=The Gal<U+00E1>pagos Tortoise Conservation Program: the Plight and Future for the Pinz<U+00F3>n Island Tortoise |work=Proceedings of the first international symposium on turtles & tortoises: conservation and captive husbandry |pages=113<U+2013>116|publisher=Chapman University |url=http://www.tortoise.org/archives/pinzon.html

;Island restoration
The Gal<U+00E1>pagos National Park Service systematically [[culling|culls]] feral predators and competitors. Goat eradication on islands, including Pinta, was achieved by the technique of using "Judas" goats with radio location collars to find the herds. Marksmen then shot all the goats except the Judas, and then returned weeks later to find the "Judas" and shoot the herd to which it had relocated. This process was repeated until only the "Judas" goat remained, which was then killed.<ref name='guardian.co.uk'>{{cite news |last=Carroll |first=R. |date=26 June 2010 |title=Gal<U+00E1>pagos giant tortoise saved from extinction by breeding programme |work=The Observer |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jun/27/giant-tortoise-galapagos-saved-extinction
|accessdate=2012-01-11}}</ref> Other measures have included dog eradication from San Crist<U+00F3>bal, and fencing off nests to protect them from feral pigs.<ref name='Cayot 1994'/>

Efforts are now underway to repopulate islands formerly inhabited by tortoises in order to restore their ecosystems ([[island restoration]]) to their pre-human condition. The tortoises are a [[keystone species]], acting as [[ecosystem engineer]]s<ref name='guardian.co.uk'/> which help in plant [[seed dispersal]], trampling down brush and thinning the understory of vegetation (allowing light to penetrate and germination to occur). Birds such as [[Galapagos Flycatcher|Flycatcher]]s perch on and fly around tortoises in order to hunt the insects they displace from the brush.<ref name='MacFarland 1972'/> In May 2010, 39 sterilised tortoises of hybrid origin were introduced to Pinta Island, the first tortoises there since the evacuation of Lonesome George 38 years ago in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724015235/http://www.galapagos.org/2008/index.php?id=68 |publisher=Galapagos Conservancy|title=Project Pinta: Restoration of Lonesome George's Birthplace|accessdate=2012-01-11}}</ref> Sterile tortoises were released so that the problem of interbreeding between subspecies would be avoided if any fertile tortoises were to be released in the future. It is hoped that with the recent identification of a hybrid ''abingdonii'' tortoise, the approximate genetic constitution of the original inhabitants of Pinta may eventually be restored with the identification and relocation of appropriate specimens to this island.<ref name='Russello 2007'/> This approach may be used to "re-tortoise" Floreana in the future, since captive individuals have been found to be descended from the extinct original stock.<ref name='Russello 2010'/>
