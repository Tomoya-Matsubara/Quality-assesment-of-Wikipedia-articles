His contributions to observational astronomy include the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, named the [[Galilean moons]] in his honour, and the observation and analysis of [[sunspots]]. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, improving [[compass]] design.

Galileo's championing of Copernicanism was controversial within his lifetime. The [[geocentric]] view had been dominant since the time of Aristotle, and the controversy engendered by Galileo's opposition to this view resulted in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic Church's]] prohibiting the advocacy of [[heliocentrism]] as potentially factual, because that theory had no decisive proof and was contrary to the literal meaning of Scripture.<ref name="contrary to scripture">[[#Reference-Sharratt-1996|Sharratt (1996, pp.127-131)]], [[#Reference-McMullin-2005a|McMullin (2005a)]].</ref> Galileo was eventually forced to recant his heliocentrism and spent the last years of his life under house arrest on orders of the [[Inquisition]].

==Life==
Galileo was born in [[Pisa]] (then part of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]), the first of six children of [[Vincenzo Galilei]], a famous [[lutenist]] and [[music theory|music theorist]], and Giulia Ammannati. At the age of 8, his family moved to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], but he was left with Jacopo Borghini for two years.<ref name="McTutor" /> He then was educated in the Camaldolese Monastery at Vallombrosa, 21&nbsp;mi southeast of Florence.<ref name="McTutor" /> Although he seriously considered the priesthood as a young man, he enrolled for a medical degree at the University of Pisa at his father's urging. He did not complete this degree, but instead studied mathematics.<ref>[[#Reference-Reston-2000| Reston (2000, pp. 3<U+2013>14).]]</ref> In 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591 his father died and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother [[Michelagnolo Galilei|Michelagnolo]]. In 1592, he moved to the [[University of Padua]], teaching [[geometry]], [[mechanics]], and [[astronomy]] until 1610.<ref>[[#Reference-Sharratt-1996|Sharratt (1996, pp. 45-66).]]</ref> During this period Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure science (for example, kinematics of motion, and astronomy) and applied science (for example, strength of materials, improvement of the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of [[astrology]], which in pre-modern disciplinary practice was seen as correlated to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.<ref>{{cite web

Although a devout [[Roman Catholic]], Galileo fathered three children [[illegitimacy|out of wedlock]] with [[Marina Gamba]]. They had two daughters, Virginia in 1600 and Livia in 1601, and one son, Vincenzio, in 1606. Because of their illegitimate birth, their father considered the girls unmarriageable. Their only worthy alternative was the religious life. Both girls were sent to the convent of San Matteo in [[Arcetri]] and remained there for the rest of their lives.<ref name="daughters unmarriageable">[[#Reference-Sobel-2000| Sobel (2000, p.5)]] [http://www.galileosdaughter.com/firstchapter.shtml Chapter 1.] Retrieved on [[August 26]] [[2007]]. "But because he never married Virginia's mother, he deemed the girl herself unmarriageable. Soon after her thirteenth birthday, he placed her at the Convent of San Matteo in Arcetri."</ref> Virginia took the name [[Maria Celeste]] upon entering the convent. She died on [[April 2]] [[1634]], and is buried with Galileo at the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze]]. Livia took the name Sister Arcangela and was ill for most of her life. Vincenzio was later [[Legitimation|legitimized]] and married Sestilia Bocchineri.<ref>{{cite conference

In 1610 Galileo published an account of his telescopic observations of the moons of Jupiter, using this observation to argue in favor of the sun-centered, [[Copernicus|Copernican]] theory of the universe against the dominant earth-centered [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic]] and Aristotelian theories. The next year Galileo visited Rome in order to demonstrate his telescope to the influential philosophers and mathematicians of the [[Jesuit]] Collegio Romano, and to let them see with their own eyes the reality of the four moons of Jupiter.<ref>[[#Reference-Gebler-1879|Gebler (1879, pp. 22-35).]]</ref> While in Rome he was also made a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].<ref>{{cite web

In 1612, opposition arose to the Sun-centered solar system which Galileo supported. In 1614, from the pulpit of Santa Maria Novella, Father [[Tommaso Caccini]] (1574<U+2013>1648) denounced Galileo's opinions on the motion of the Earth, judging them dangerous and close to [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. Galileo went to Rome to defend himself against these accusations, but, in 1616, [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Roberto Bellarmino]] personally handed Galileo an admonition enjoining him neither to advocate nor teach Copernican astronomy.<ref>There are contradictory documents describing the nature of this admonition and the circumstances of its delivery. Finocchiaro, ''The Galileo Affair'', pp.147<U+2013>149, 153</ref> During 1621 and 1622 Galileo wrote his first book, ''[[The Assayer]]'' (''Il Saggiatore''), which was approved and published in 1623. In 1630, he returned to Rome to apply for a license to print the ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', published in [[Florence]] in 1632. In October of that year, however, he was ordered to appear before the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] in Rome.

Following a papal trial in which he was found vehemently suspect of heresy, Galileo was placed under house arrest and his movements restricted by the Pope. From 1634 onward he stayed at his country house at Arcetri, outside of Florence. He went completely blind in 1638 and was suffering from a painful [[hernia]] and [[insomnia]], so he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical advice. He continued to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, he passed away.<ref>{{cite book

== Scientific methods ==
Galileo Galilei pioneered the use of quantitative experiments whose results could be analyzed with mathematical precision. More typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of [[William Gilbert]], on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, [[Vincenzo Galilei]], a [[lute]]nist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension.<ref>{{cite book

Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.<ref>{{cite book

Galileo is perhaps the first to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. In ''[[The Assayer]]'' he wrote "Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe&nbsp;... It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures; ...".<ref>In [[#Reference-Drake-1957| Drake (1957, pp.237<U+2212>238)]]</ref> His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy.<ref>Wallace, (1984).</ref> Although he tried to remain loyal to the Catholic Church, his adherence to experimental results, and their most honest interpretation, led to a rejection of blind allegiance to authority, both philosophical and religious, in matters of science. In broader terms, this aided to separate science from both [[philosophy]] and religion; a major development in human thought.

By the standards of his time, Galileo was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. Philosopher of science [[Paul Feyerabend]] also noted the supposedly improper aspects of Galileo's methodology, but he argued that Galileo's methods could be justified retroactively by their results. The bulk of Feyerabend's major work, ''Against Method'' (1975), was devoted to an analysis of Galileo, using his astronomical research as a case study to support Feyerabend's own anarchistic theory of [[scientific method]]. As he put it: 'Aristotelians ... demanded strong empirical support while the Galileans were content with far-reaching, unsupported and partially refuted theories. I do not criticize them for that; on the contrary, I favour [[Niels Bohr]]'s "this is not crazy enough."'<ref>{{cite book

 | isbn=0860916464 }}</ref> In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion.

Galileo showed a remarkably modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the [[parabola]], both in terms of [[conic section]]s and in terms of the [[ordinate]] (y) varying as the square of the [[abscissa]] (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically-ideal [[trajectory]] for uniformly accelerated motion, in the absence of [[friction]] and other disturbances. He also noted that there are limits to the validity of this theory, stating that it was appropriate only for laboratory-scale and battlefield-scale trajectories, and noting on theoretical grounds that the parabola could not possibly apply to a trajectory so large as to be comparable to the size of the [[planet]].<ref> [[#Reference-Galileo-1954| Galilei (1954, p.250);]] [[#Reference-Favaro-1890| Favaro (1898,]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&VOLPAG=274 8:274)] {{it icon}}. </ref> Thirdly, Galilei recognized that his experimental data would never agree exactly with any theoretical or mathematical form, because of the imprecision of measurement, irreducible friction, and other factors.

According to [[Stephen Hawking]], Galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody else,<ref name="Hawking galileo">[[#Reference-Hawking-1988| Hawking (1988, p.179)]].</ref> and [[Albert Einstein]] called him the father of modern science.<ref name="father of science Einstein">[[#Reference-Einstein-1954| Einstein (1954, p.271)]]. "Propositions arrived at by purely logical means are completely empty as regards reality. Because Galileo realised this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics&mdash;indeed, of modern science altogether."</ref>

===Contributions===
[[Image:Galileo.script.arp.600pix.jpg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|It was on this page that Galileo first noted an observation of the [[natural satellite|moons]] of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. This observation upset the notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around the Earth. Galileo published a full description in ''Sidereus Nuncius'' in March 1610]][[Image:Phases-of-Venus.svg|thumb|200px|right|The phases of Venus, observed by Galileo in 1610]]

Based only on uncertain descriptions of the telescope, invented in the [[Netherlands]] in 1608, Galileo, in that same year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification, and later made others with up to about 32x magnification. With this improved device he could see magnified, upright images on the earth - it was what is now known as a terrestrial telescope, or spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he was one of very few who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On [[25 August]] [[1609]], he demonstrated his first telescope to [[Venice|Venetian]] lawmakers. His work on the device made for a profitable sideline with merchants who found it useful for their shipping businesses and trading issues. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a short treatise entitled ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Starry Messenger'').

On [[January 7]] [[1610]] Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as "three fixed stars, totally invisible<ref name=invisible>i.e. invisible to the naked eye.</ref> by their smallness", all within a short distance of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]], and lying on a straight line through it.<ref name="jupiter's moons">[[#Reference-Drake-1978| Drake (1978, p.146).]]</ref> Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these "stars" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On [[January 10]] Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days he concluded that they were [[orbit]]ing Jupiter:<ref name=moonconclusion> In ''Sidereus Nuncius'' [[#Reference-Favaro-1890| (Favaro,]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=3&VOLPAG=81 1892, 3:81] {{latin}}) Galileo stated that he had reached this conclusion on [[January 11]]. [[#Reference-Drake-1978| Drake (1978, p.152)]], however, after studying unpublished manuscript records of Galileo's observations, concluded that he did not do so until [[January 15]]. </ref> he had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest [[natural satellite|satellites]] (moons): [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]. He discovered the fourth, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], on [[January 13]]. Galileo named the four satellites he had discovered ''Medicean stars'', in honour of his future patron, Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Cosimo's three brothers.<ref name="medicean stars">[[#Reference-Sharratt-1996|Sharratt (1996, p.17)]].</ref> Later astronomers, however, renamed them [[Galilean moons|''Galilean satellites'']] in honour of Galileo himself.

A planet with smaller planets orbiting it was problematic for the orderly, comprehensive picture of the [[geocentric model]] of the universe, in which everything was supposed to circle around the Earth. As a consequence, many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing.<ref name=scepticism>[[#Reference-Drake-1978| Drake (1978, p.158&ndash;68)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1996| Sharratt (1996, p.18&ndash;19)]].</ref>

Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods&mdash;a feat which [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] had believed impossible.<ref name=periods>[[#Reference-Drake-1978| Drake (1978, p.168)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1996| Sharratt (1996, p.93)]].</ref>

From September 1610, Galileo observed that [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] exhibited a full set of [[Lunar phase|phases]] similar to that of the [[Moon]]. The [[heliocentric model]] of the solar system developed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the [[Sun]] would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. In contrast, the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]] predicted that only crescent and new phases would be seen, since Venus was thought to remain between the Sun and Earth during its orbit around the Earth. Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus proved that it orbited the Sun and lent support to (but did not prove) the [[heliocentric model]]. However, since it refuted the [[Ptolemaic]] pure geocentric planetary model, it seems it was the crucial observation that caused the 17th century majority conversion of the scientific community to geoheliocentric geocentric models such as the [[Tychonic]] and [[Capellan]] models, and was thereby arguably Galileo<U+2019>s historically most important astronomical observation.

Galileo also observed the planet [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], and at first mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he observed the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.<ref>Baalke, Ron. [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html Historical Background of Saturn's Rings.] Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, NASA. Retrieved on [[2007-03-11]]</ref>

Galileo was one of the first Europeans to observe [[sunspot]]s, although Kepler had unwittingly observed one in 1607, but mistook it for a transit of Mercury.. He also reinterpreted a sunspot observation from the time of [[Charlemagne]], which formerly had been attributed (impossibly) to a transit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. The very existence of sunspots showed another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens posited by orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics, but their regular periodic transits also confirmed the dramatic novel prediction of Kepler's Aristotelian celestial dynamics in his 1609 ''Astronomia Nova'' that the sun rotates, which was the first successful novel prediction of post-spherist celestial physics.<ref>In Kepler's Thomist 'inertial' variant of Aristotelian dynamics as opposed to Galileo's impetus dynamics variant all bodies universally have an inherent resistance to all motion and tendency to rest, which he dubbed 'inertia'. This notion or inertia was originally introduced by Averroes in the 12th century just for the celestial spheres in order to explain why they do not rotate with infinite speed on Aristotelian dynamics, as they should if they had no resistance to their movers. And in his ''Astronomia Nova'' celestial mechanics the inertia of the planets is overcome in their solar orbital motion by their being pushed around by the sunspecks of the rotating sun acting like the spokes of a rotating cartwheel. And more generally it predicted all but only planets with orbiting satellites, such as Jupiter for example, also rotate to push them around, whereas the Moon, for example, does not rotate, thus always presenting the same face to the Earth, because it has no satellites to push around. These seem to have been the first successful novel predictions of Thomist 'inertial' Aristotelian dynamics as well as of post-spherist celestial physics.</ref> And the annual variations in sunspots' motions, first noticed by [[Francesco Sizzi]], provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic system and the geoheliocentric system of [[Tycho Brahe]].<ref name="sunspot argument">In geostatic systems the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots could only be explained as the result of an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation [[#Reference-Linton-2004 |(Linton, 2004, p.212;]] [[#Reference-Sharratt-1996 |Sharratt, 1996, p.166;]] [[#Reference-Drake-1970 |Drake, 1970, pp.191&ndash;196)]]</ref>  A dispute over priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation, led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the Jesuit [[Christoph Scheiner]]; in fact, there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by [[David Fabricius]] and his son [[Johannes Fabricius|Johannes]], looking for confirmation of Kepler's prediction of the sun's rotation.  Scheiner quickly adopted Kepler's 1615 proposal of the modern telescope design, which gave larger magnification at the cost of inverted images; Galileo apparently never changed to Kepler's design.

Galileo was the first to report lunar [[mountain]]s and [[impact crater|craters]], whose existence he deduced from the patterns of light and shadow on the Moon's surface. He even estimated the mountains' heights from these observations. This led him to the conclusion that the Moon was "rough and uneven, and just like the surface of the Earth itself," rather than a perfect [[sphere]] as Aristotle had claimed. Galileo observed the [[Milky Way]], previously believed to be [[Nebula|nebulous]], and found it to be a multitude of [[star]]s packed so densely that they appeared to be clouds from Earth. He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. Galileo also observed the planet [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]] in 1612, but did not realize that it was a planet and took no particular notice of it. It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars.

=== Controversy over comets and ''The Assayer'' ===
{{Main|The Assayer}}

In 1619, Galileo became embroiled in a controversy with Father [[Orazio Grassi]], professor of mathematics at the Jesuit [[Collegio Romano]]. It began as a dispute over the nature of comets, but by the time Galileo had published ''[[The Assayer]]'' (''Il Saggiatore'') in 1623, his last salvo in the dispute, it had become a much wider argument over the very nature of Science itself. Because ''The Assayer'' contains such a wealth of Galileo's ideas on how Science should be practised, it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto.<ref name="scientific manifesto">[[#Reference-Drake-1960| Drake (1960, pp.vii,xxiii-xxiv)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1996| Sharratt (1996, pp.139-140)]].</ref>

Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, ''[[The Assayer#disputatio|An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618]]''<!--This should eventually link to a section in the article on the Assayer -->,<ref name="disputatio">[[#Reference-Grassi-1960a| Grassi (1960a)]].</ref> which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth,<ref name="grassi great circle">[[#Reference-Drake-1978| Drake (1978, p.268)]], [[#Reference-Grassi-1960a| Grassi (1960a, p.16)]].</ref> and that it had been located well beyond the moon.

Grassi's arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article, ''[[The Assayer#Discourse on Comets|Discourse on the Comets]]''<!--This should eventually link to a section in the article on the Assayer -->,<ref name="discourse on comets">[[#Reference-Galileo&Guiducci-1960| Galilei & Guiducci (1960)]].</ref> published under the name of one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named [[Mario Guiducci]], although it had been largely written by Galileo himself.<ref name="authorship of discourse">[[#Reference-Drake-1960| Drake (1960, p.xvi)]].</ref> Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets,<ref name="criticism of previous theories">[[#Reference-Drake-1957| Drake (1957, p.222)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1960| Drake (1960, p.xvii)]].</ref> although they did present some tentative conjectures which we now know to be mistaken.

===Galileo, Kepler and theories of tides===
Cardinal Bellarmine had written in 1615 that the Copernican system could not be defended without "a true [[physical]] demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun".<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 67&ndash;9.</ref> Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of the motion of the earth. This theory was so important to Galileo that he originally intended to entitle his ''Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems'' the ''Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea''.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), p. 354, n. 52</ref> For Galileo, the [[tide]]s were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface speeded up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. Galileo circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp.119&ndash;133</ref>

If this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at [[Venice]] instead of one, about twelve hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes, including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp.127&ndash;131 and Drake (1953), pp. 432&ndash;6</ref> Against the assertion that Galileo was deceptive in making these arguments, [[Albert Einstein]] expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his "fascinating arguments" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth.<ref>Einstein (1952) p. xvii</ref>

Galileo dismissed as a "useless fiction" the idea, held by his contemporary [[Johannes Kepler]], that the moon caused the tides.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), p. 128</ref> Galileo also refused to accept [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] elliptical orbits of the planets,<ref>Sachiko Kusukawa.

Galileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as [[technology]], as distinct from pure physics, and suggested others. This is not the same distinction as made by Aristotle, who would have considered all Galileo's physics as ''techne'' or useful knowledge, as opposed to ''episteme'', or philosophical investigation into the causes of things. Between 1595&ndash;1598, Galileo devised and improved a ''Geometric and Military Compass'' suitable for use by [[artillery|gunners]] and [[surveying|surveyors]]. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by [[Niccol<U+00F2> Tartaglia]] and [[Guidobaldo del Monte]]. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating [[cannon]]s accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of [[gunpowder]] for [[Round shot|cannonballs]] of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular [[polygon]], computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. About [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|1593]], Galileo constructed a [[thermometer]], using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.

In 1609, Galileo was among the first to use a [[refracting telescope]] as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. Galileo's telescope was the first instrument given that name by an unidentified Greek poet/theologian, present at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince [[Federico Cesi]] to make Galileo a member of his [[Accademia dei Lincei]].<ref>[http://www.omni-optical.com/telescope/ut104.htm omni-optical.com "''A Very Short History of the Telescope''"]</ref> The name was derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tele'' = 'far' and ''skopein'' = 'to look or see'.

The actual inventors of the telescope and microscope remain debatable. A general view on this can be found in the article [http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/lippershey.html Hans Lippershey] (last updated [[2003-08-01]]), <U+00A9> 1995-2007 by Davidson, Michael W.<!--NO LINK to the Republican political activist--> and the [[Florida State University]]. Retrieved [[2007-08-28]]</ref>. The [[Accademia dei Lincei|Linceans]] played a role again in naming the "microscope" a year later when fellow academy member [[Giovanni Faber]] coined the word for Galileo's invention from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''<U+03BC><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BD>'' (''micron'') meaning "small", and ''<U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03B5><U+1FD6><U+03BD>'' (''skopein'') meaning "to look at".

In 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of [[longitude]]. He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life; but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used by [[Lewis and Clark]]. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable [[marine chronometer]], such as that of [[John Harrison]].

In his last year, when totally blind, he designed an [[escapement]] mechanism for a pendulum clock, a vectorial model of which may be seen [[Galileo's escapement|here]]. The first fully operational pendulum clock was made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s. Galilei created sketches of various inventions, such as a candle and mirror combination to reflect light throughout a building, an automatic tomato picker, a pocket comb that doubled as an eating utensil, and what appears to be a ballpoint pen.

==Physics==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}
Galileo's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]], was a precursor of the [[classical mechanics]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]]. He was a pioneer, at least in the European tradition, in performing rigorous experiments and insisting on a [[mathematics|mathematical]] description of the laws of nature.

A biography by Galileo's pupil [[Vincenzo Viviani]] stated that Galileo had dropped [[ball]]s of the same material, but different [[mass]]es, from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.<ref>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, pp.19,20)]]. At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place, Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall. He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies ''of the same material'' falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(Drake, 1978, p.20)]].</ref> This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight.<ref>[[#Reference-Drake-1978| Drake (1978, p.9)]]; [[#Reference-Sharratt-1996|Sharratt (1996, p.31)]].  </ref> While this story has been retold in popular accounts, it is generally accepted by historians that there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and that it was at most a [[thought experiment]] which did not actually take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/galileo/experiments.html|title=Galileo's Battle for the Heavens].

Galileo arrived at the correct mathematical law for uniform acceleration: the total distance covered, starting from rest, is proportional to the square of the time (<math>d \propto t^2</math>), already discovered by [[Domingo de Soto]] in the 16th century. He expressed this law using geometrical constructions and mathematically-precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms). But he erroneously claimed gravitational free-fall universally is uniformly accelerated as the fundamental law of motion of his cosmology and cosmogony, a claim that was never generally accepted and soon refuted by the 1660s discovery that it is exponentially increasingly accelerated (a difform motion in scholastic terms) and inversely proportional to distance from its gravitational centre. He also concluded that objects ''retain their velocity'' unless a [[force]]&mdash;often [[friction]]&mdash;acts upon them, refuting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that objects "naturally" slow down and stop unless a force acts upon them (philosophical ideas relating to [[inertia]] had been proposed by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] centuries earlier, as had [[Jean Buridan]], and according to [[Joseph Needham]], [[Mo Tzu]] had proposed it centuries before either of them, but this was the first time that it had been mathematically expressed, verified experimentally, and introduced the idea of [[friction|frictional force]], the key breakthrough in validating inertia). Galileo's Principle of Inertia stated: "A body moving on a level surface will continue in the same direction at constant speed unless disturbed." This principle was incorporated into [[Newton's laws of motion]] (first law).[[Image:Pisa.Duomo.dome.Riminaldi01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dome of the cathedral of Pisa with the "lamp of Galileo"]]

Galileo also claimed (incorrectly) that a [[pendulum]]'s swings always take the same amount of time, independently of the [[amplitude]]. That is, that a simple pendulum is [[isochronous]]. It is popularly believed that he came to this conclusion by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse to time it. It appears however, that he conducted no experiments because the claim is true only of infinitesimally small swings as discovered by [[Christian Huygens]]. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in [[1642]]. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its [[verge escapement]], would have been a poor timekeeper. (See [[#Technology|Technology]] above.)

In 1638 Galileo described an experimental method to measure the [[Speed_of_light#Measurement_of_the_speed_of_light |  speed of light]] by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously.<ref>Galileo Galilei, ''Two New Sciences,'' (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1974) p. 50.</ref> Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine ''[[Accademia del Cimento]]'' repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result.<ref>I. Bernard Cohen, "Roemer and the First Determination of the Velocity of Light (1676)," ''Isis'', 31 (1940): 327<U+2013>379, see pp. 332<U+2013>333</ref>

Galileo is lesser known for, yet still credited with, being one of the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency.

In his 1632 [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]] Galileo presented a physical theory to account for [[tide]]s, based on the motion of the Earth. If correct, this would have been a strong argument for the reality of the Earth's motion. In fact, the original title for the book described it as a dialogue on the tides; the reference to tides was removed by order of the Inquisition. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the [[Adriatic Sea]] compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure. Kepler and others correctly associated the Moon with an influence over the tides, based on empirical data; a proper physical theory of the tides, however, was not available until Newton.

Galileo also put forward [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]], that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special theory of relativity]].

==Mathematics==
While Galileo's application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxian]] theory of proportion, as set forth in the fifth book of [[Euclid's Elements]]. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by [[Niccol<U+00F2> Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and others; but by the end of Galileo's life it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes|Descartes]].

Galileo produced one piece of original and even prophetic work in mathematics: [[Galileo's paradox]], which shows that there are as many perfect squares as there are whole numbers, even though most numbers are not perfect squares. Such seeming contradictions were brought under control 250 years later in the work of [[Georg Cantor]].

==Church controversy==
{{main|Galileo affair}}
[[Image:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|250px|Cristiano Banti's 1857 painting ''Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition'']]

Western Christian biblical references [[Psalms|Psalm]] 93:1, Psalm 96:10, and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 16:30 include text stating that "the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved." In the same tradition, {{bibleverse||Psalm|104:5|NIV}} says, "[[the LORD]] set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved." Further, [[Ecclesiastes]] 1:5 states that "And the sun rises and sets and returns to its place, etc."<ref name="Bellarmine quote">[[#Reference-Brodrick-1965| Brodrick (1965, c1964, p.95)]] quoting Cardinal Bellarmine's [[letter to Foscarini]], dated April 12, 1615. Translated from [[#Reference-Favaro-1890| Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=12&VOLPAG=171 (1902, 12:171&ndash;172)] {{it icon}}.</ref>

Galileo defended [[heliocentrism]], and claimed it was not contrary to those Scripture passages. He took [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally, particularly when the scripture in question is a book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the sun does rise and set. In fact, it is the earth's rotation which gives the impression of the sun in motion across the sky.

By 1616 the attacks on Galileo had reached a head, and he went to [[Rome]] to try to persuade the Church authorities not to ban his ideas. In the end, [[Cardinal Bellarmine]], acting on directives from the Inquisition, delivered him an order not to "hold or defend" the idea that the Earth moves and the Sun stands still at the centre. The decree did not prevent Galileo from discussing heliocentrism hypothetically. For the next several years Galileo stayed well away from the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of [[Cardinal Barberini]] as [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. The book, ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the [[Inquisition]] and papal permission.

Pope Urban VIII personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo. Whether unknowingly or deliberate, Simplicius, the defender of the Aristotelian Geocentric view in ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool. This fact made ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'' appear as an advocacy book; an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defense of the Copernican theory. To add insult to injury, Galileo put the words of Pope Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicius. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.<ref> See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp.133&ndash;134)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p.30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p.355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p.491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of haviing intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p.483)]]</ref> However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the blatant bias. Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings.

With the loss of many of his defenders in Rome because of ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', Galileo was ordered to stand trial on suspicion of heresy in 1633. The sentence of the Inquisition was in three essential parts:
*Galileo was required to [[Abjuration|abjure]] the opinion that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, and that the Earth is not at its centre and moves; the idea that the Sun is stationary was condemned as "formally heretical." However, while there is no doubt that Pope Urban VIII and the vast majority of Church officials did not believe in heliocentrism, heliocentrism was never formally or officially condemned by the Catholic Church, except insofar as it held (for instance, in the formal condemnation of Galileo) that "The proposition that the sun is in the center of the world and immovable from its place is absurd, philosophically false, and formally heretical; because it is expressly contrary to Holy Scriptures", and the converse as to the Sun's not revolving around the Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1630galileo.html |title=The Crime of Galileo: Indictment and Abjuration of 1633 |publisher=Modern History Sourcebook |accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>
*He was ordered imprisoned; the sentence was later commuted to house arrest.
*His offending ''Dialogue'' was banned; and in an action not announced at the trial, publication of any of his works was forbidden, including any he might write in the future.<ref name="publication-ban">[[#Reference-Drake-1978| Drake (1978, p.367),]] [[#Reference-Sharratt-1996| Sharratt (1996, p.184),]] [[#Reference-Favaro-1890| Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&VOLPAG=230 230)]{{it icon}}.

According to popular legend, after recanting his theory that the Earth moved around the Sun, Galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase [[E pur si muove!|''And yet it moves'']], but there is no evidence that he actually said this or anything similarly impertinent.

After a period with the friendly [[Ascanio Piccolomini]] (the Archbishop of [[Siena]]), Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at [[Arcetri]] near Florence, where he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest, and where he later became blind. It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works, [[Two New Sciences]]. Here he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called [[kinematics]] and [[strength of materials]]. This book has received high praise from both [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. As a result of this work, Galileo is often called, the "father of modern physics".

Galileo died on [[January 8]], [[1642]]. The Grand Duke of Tuscany, [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]], wished to bury him in the main body of the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica of Santa Croce]], next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour.<ref name=funeral>[[#Reference-Shea&Artigas-2003| Shea & Artigas (2003, p.199)]]; [[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p.378)]].</ref> These plans were scrapped, however, after Pope Urban VIII and his nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, protested.<ref name="funeral protests"> [[#Reference-Shea&Artigas-2003| Shea & Artigas (2003, p.199)]]; [[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p.378)]]; [[#Reference-Sharratt-1996|Sharratt (1996, p.207)]]; [[#Reference-Favaro-1890| Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=18&VOLPAG=378 (1906,18:378&ndash;80)] {{it icon}}.</ref> He was instead buried in a small room next to the novices' chapel at the end of a corridor from the southern transept of the basilica to the sacristy.<ref name="burial spot">[[#Reference-Shea&Artigas-2003| Shea & Artigas (2003, p.199)]]; [[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p.380)]].</ref> He was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737 after a monument had been erected there in his honour.<ref name="reburial spot">[[#Reference-Shea&Artigas-2003| Shea & Artigas (2003, p.200)]]; [[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p.380&ndash;384)]].</ref>

The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned ''Dialogue'') in Florence.<ref name="incomplete works">[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005| Heilbron (2005, p.299)]].</ref> In 1741 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] authorized the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works<ref name="complete works 1">Two of his non-scientific works, the letters to Castelli and the Grand Duchess Christina, were explicitly not allowed to be included [[#Reference-Coyne-2005| (Coyne 2005, p.347)]].</ref> which included a mildly censored version of the ''Dialogue''.<ref name="complete works 2">[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005| Heilbron (2005, p.303&ndash;04)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005| Coyne (2005, p.347)]]. The uncensored version of the ''Dialogue'' remained on the Index of prohibited books, however [[#Reference-Heilbron-2005| (Heilbron 2005, p.279)]].</ref> In 1758 the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of prohibited books]], although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the ''Dialogue'' and Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' remained.<ref name="ban not lifted">[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005| Heilbron (2005, p.307)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005| Coyne (2005, p.347)]]</ref> All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the Church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.<ref name="ban lifted">[[#Reference-McMullin-2005| McMullin (2005, p.6)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005| Coyne (2005, p.346)]]. In fact, the Church's opposition had effectively ended in 1820 when a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, was given permission to publish a work which treated heliocentism as a physical fact rather than a mathematical fiction. The 1835 edition of the Index was the first to be issued after that year.</ref>

In 1939 [[Pope Pius XII]], in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his election to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the ''"most audacious heroes of research&nbsp;... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments"''<ref>Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences 1939-1986, Vatican City, p.34</ref> His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber wrote: "Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo."<ref>Robert Leiber, Pius XII Stimmen der Zeit, November 1958 in Pius XII. Sagt, Frankfurt 1959, p.411 </ref>

On [[February 15]], [[1990]], in a speech delivered at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]],<ref>An earlier version had been delivered on [[December 16]], [[1989]], in Rieti, and a later version in Madrid on [[February 24]], [[1990]] [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(Ratzinger, 1994, p.81)]]. According to Feyerabend himself, Ratzinger had also mentioned him "in support of" his own views in a speech in Parma around the same time [[#Reference-Feyerabend-1995|(Feyerabend, 1995, p.178)]].</ref> [[Cardinal Ratzinger]] cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called "a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology goes today."<ref name=self-doubt>Ratzinger [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(1994, p.98)]].</ref> Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]], whom he quoted as saying <U+201C>The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune.<U+201D><ref name="scupper"> Ratzinger [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(1994, p.98)]]</ref> The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say "It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views".<ref name=self-doubt/>

On [[31 October]] [[1992]], [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed regret for how the Galileo affair was handled, and officially conceded that the Earth was not stationary, as the result of a study conducted by the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]].<ref> [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13618460.600-vatican-admits-galileo-was-right-.html Vatican admits Galileo was right.] ''New Scientist'' [[7 November]] [[1992]].

*There is a play called [[Life of Galileo]] by the German dramatist [[Bertolt Brecht]]. It was filmed in 1975 as ''[[Galileo (movie)|Galileo]]'', with [[Topol]] in the title role, and an all-star cast.
*A play about Galileo's struggle with the Church, ''Lamp at Midnight'', was first televised in 1966 on the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]], with [[Melvyn Douglas]] as Galileo and [[Kim Hunter]] as his daughter. The production also featured an appearance by [[Roy Scheider]] in an early role.
*Galileo is mentioned in [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] song, [[Bohemian Rhapsody]].
*The American duo [[Indigo Girls]] released a song in 1992 about the "king of night vision" whose head was "on the block." Entitled [[Galileo (Indigo Girls song)|"Galileo,"]] the song hit the #10 spot on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] Modern Rock Tracks chart, the biggest hit to date for the musical duo.
*Galileo is also the title of a song by [[Amy Grant]].
*The Philadelphia Atmospheric Sludge Metal band named their 2005 full length "The Galilean Satellites", wherein most songs are about Jupiter and its 4 Galilean moons, specifically [[Europa]].
*The Symphonic Metal band Haggard made an album based on the life of Galileo and the legend that he muttered the phrase Eppur si muove meaning "And yet it does move", after being forced to recant, in front of the Inquisition.
*The shuttlecraft used in the [[Star Trek]] first season episode [[The Galileo Seven]] is named after the famed astronomer. When that shuttle is destroyed at the end of the episode, another shuttlecraft is named the Galileo II.
