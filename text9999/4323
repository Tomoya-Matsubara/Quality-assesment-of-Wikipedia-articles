Eyles at Lambiek Comiclopedia]</ref> which made him particularly suitable for [[western (genre)|western]] characters, including [[Wild Bill Hickok]],<ref name="gifford" /> [[Kit Carson]]<ref name="bookpalace" /> and [[Buffalo Bill]],<ref name="wright&ashford" /> as well other historical characters like [[Hereward the Wake]], [[Robin Hood]]<ref name="clark" /> and [[Dick Turpin]],<ref name="wright&ashford" /> and new artists were given samples of his work as examples of how to "do horses properly".<ref name="bookpalace" />

In the 1960s he worked mainly in the nursery end of the comics market, on titles like ''[[Treasure (comic)|Treasure]]'' and ''[[TV Toyland]]'', and for girls' titles like ''[[Tina (comic)|Tina]]'' and ''[[Princess Tina]]''. By the 1970s westerns and other equestrian genres had fallen out of fashion, and Eyles struggled to get work. Suffering from [[diabetes]], he died in December 1974 after an unsuccessful operation.<ref name="wright&ashford" />
