'''''Ecstasy''''' is the second [[mini-LP|mini album]] by the [[alternative rock]] band [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], released on 25&nbsp;November 1987&nbsp;on Lazy Records. Released in a limited edition of 3,000&nbsp;copies, it was the band's final release for Lazy Records and second to feature vocalist and guitarist [[Bilinda Butcher]], who was recruited in April 1987&nbsp;following the departure of original My Bloody Valentine vocalist [[David Conway (author)|David Conway]]. ''Ecstasy'' followed the [[noise pop]] and [[Indie pop|twee pop]] standards of My Bloody Valentine's earlier releases for the label, drawing influence from various artists including [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[Love (band)|Love]] and [[The Byrds]], and the album distanced the band further from their earlier [[post-punk]] and [[gothic rock]] sound.

The album experienced several technical and financial problems during its recording sessions, including errors in the [[Audio mastering|mastering]] process, and the band were dissatisfied with its outcome; although upon its release, ''Ecstasy'' received moderate critical acclaim and peaked at number 12&nbsp;on the [[UK Indie Chart|UK Independent Albums Chart]]. The album was later combined with My Bloody Valentine's preceding single, "[[Strawberry Wine (My Bloody Valentine song)|Strawberry Wine]]", and reissued on the compilation album ''[[Ecstasy and Wine]]'' (1989), which was released on Lazy Records without the band's consent.

==Background==
Following minor success on the underground scene after the release of ''[[The New Record by My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1986) and 1987's "[[Sunny Sundae Smile]]", original [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] vocalist [[David Conway (author)|David Conway]] left the band due to a gastric illness, dillusionment with music and his ambitions to become a writer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=Vachel|year=1989|title=My Bloody Valentine: Weep For You|journal=Underground|issue=February 1989|page=25}}</ref> The remaining members<U+2014>guitarist [[Kevin Shields]], drummer [[Colm <U+00D3> C<U+00ED>os<U+00F3>ig]] and bassist [[Debbie Googe]]<U+2014>considered splitting up and forming a new band under a different name. However, the band placed advertisements for a vocalist in the local music press in London, which Shields referred to later as "pointless [...] disastrous and excrutiating" due to the advertisements attracting a number of [[Morrissey]]-inspired vocalists who he referred to as "fruitballs".<ref name="ss">{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Nick|year=1991|title=My Bloody Valentine|journal=Spiral Scratch|issue=February 1991}}</ref> Through mutual friends, the band recruited two vocalists, Joe Byfield and [[Bilinda Butcher]]. After performing one show in April 1987&nbsp;with both on vocals, My Bloody Valentine considered Byfield "unsuitable" for the band and he was subsequently fired. Butcher, whose prior musical experience had been playing classical guitar as a child, and singing and playing tambourine "with some girlfriends for fun",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://totallydublin.ie/music/music-features/butchers-block|title=TD Archive: My Bloody Valentine's Bilinda Butcher Interviewed|work=[[Totally Dublin]]|publisher=Totally Partner|last=Johannesson|first=Ika|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> was chosen as My Bloody Valentine's new vocalist and began rehearsing with the band in the middle of 1987.

[[File:Bilinda Butcher - ATP 2009.jpg|thumb|right|''Ecstasy'' was the band's second release to feature vocalist and guitarist [[Bilinda Butcher]] (''pictured in 2009''), who was recruited in April 1987.]]
Lazy Records, on which the band released "Sunny Sundae Smile", requested a full-length album from My Bloody Valentine during summer 1987. The band refused the label's request, claiming their newly-formed line-up "had only been together a couple of months and hadn't really had time to get settled".<ref name="ss" /> However, the band compromised and agreed to record a [[Mini-LP|mini album]], provided they could release a single beforehand. The preceding single, "[[Strawberry Wine (My Bloody Valentine song)|Strawberry Wine]]", was released on 9&nbsp;November 1987&nbsp;and peaked at number 13&nbsp;on the [[UK Indie Chart|UK Independent Singles Chart]].{{sfn|Lazell|1997|p=155}}

==Recording==
The recording sessions for ''Ecstasy'' took place a week after the recording sessions for "Strawberry Wine". My Bloody Valentine spent a total of ten days recording the mini album. According to Kevin Shields, the sessions "had no direction and [the band] didn't even know what [they] were doing",<ref name="ss" /> and they "bashed out all these tunes quickly, very [[Demo (music)|demo]]-like".<ref name="bh">{{cite interview|last=North|first=Aaron|title=Kevin Shields: The Buddyhead Interview|program=[[Buddyhead Records|Buddyhead]]|url=http://samizdat.cc/shelf/documents/2005/01.30-kevinsheilds/kevinsheilds.pdf|format=PDF|city=[[New York City|New York]]|date=19 January 2005|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> A number of songs were recorded that did not feature on the final release, as the band considered them "awful". However, the sessions were "the first time [the band had] actually played around properly in the studio", which resulted in "extreme" and "quite nasty" guitar sounds,<ref name="ss" /> which My Bloody Valentine would later become associated with.{{sfn|DiPerna|1992|p=152}}

''Ecstasy''{{'}}s recording was plagued by technical and financial errors, which impacted the eventual release of the album. The [[Audio mastering|mastering]] process was affected by the album's [[Audio engineering|engineer]] Steve Nunn, who mislaid the source material of the final mix prior to its transfer to the master recording. Shields subsequently "brought an independent engineer in to the studios to point out what was wrong" but Lazy Records refused to invest further finances into the album's recording process.<ref name="ss" /> As a result, "much of what was originally the sound of ''Ecstacy'' {{sic}} was lost, and much of the tone was dulled" and the album "showed a group who appeared to have run out of money half way through recording".<ref name="ss" />

==Composition==
All of ''Ecstasy''{{'}}s seven tracks were written and composed by Kevin Shields, with Colm <U+00D3> C<U+00ED>os<U+00F3>ig credited as the co-writer of three tracks<U+2014>"The Things I Miss", "Clair" and "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me".<ref name="notes">{{cite AV media notes|title=Ecstasy|artist=[[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]|year=1987|type=LP|publisher=Lazy Records|id=LAZY 08}}</ref> Regarding the lyrical content of the album in contrast to the music, Shields said that "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere".<ref name="mm">{{cite journal|last1=Nicholls|first1=Phil|year=1988|title=The Excellence of Ecstasy|journal=[[Melody Maker]]|issue=20 January 1988|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> <U+00D3> C<U+00ED>os<U+00F3>ig remarked that "it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship" and referred to the lyrics as being marked by "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things".<ref name="mm" /> Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour" and considered the songwriting process for ''Ecstasy'' as "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Speller|first1=Stephen|year=1988|title=Dream Demons|journal=[[NME]]|issue=10 December 1988|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>

My Bloody Valentine experimented with a [[noise pop]] sound on the album, a venture which was influenced by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], and incorporated elements of [[Indie pop|twee pop]], similar to "Strawberry Wine". Shields used a [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve-string electric guitar]] during the ''Ecstasy''{{'}}s recording sessions and was influenced by [[The Byrds]] during the writing process, which resulted in the guitar tones being "too jingly jangly".<ref name="bh" /> Writer [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] described ''Ecstasy''{{'}}s sound as "bubblegum pop with buzzsaw guitars", which was similar to their prior releases and further diverged from their earlier [[post-punk]] and [[gothic rock]] sound.{{sfn|Larkin|1992|p=193}} [[Jim DeRogatis]] noted that ''Ecstasy''{{'}}s overall sound "ushered in a sunnier, more optimistic vibe" for the band which was reminiscent of the sound of 1960s American [[Psychedelic music|psychadelia]], in particular the Los Angeles-based band [[Love (band)|Love]].{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=164}} "Clair", one of the first recordings to feature Bilinda Butcher, features a sampled tape [[Loop (music)|loop]] of audience screams from [[The Beatles]]{{'}} live album, ''[[The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl]]'' (1977). The sample was processed through audio filters to emulate guitar [[Audio feedback|feedback]].<ref name="mm" />

{{Listen|filename=My Bloody Valentine - Clair.ogg|title="Clair"|description="Clair" demonstrated the band's [[noise pop]] sound, which was influenced by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].|pos=right}}
However, the music on ''Ecstasy'' have been criticised as being "directionless and floundered about within the framework of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas,"<ref name="ss" /> which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that "even when we'd finished it we didn't like half the songs we'd done. The record never came out right and it made us realise that we were still too twee".<ref name="ss" /> In response to the band's "unwanted reputation for jangly feyness",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dalton|first1=Stephen|year=1992|title=My Bloody Valentine: The Sound of Violence|journal=[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]|issue=April 1992|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American [[indie rock]] music and Shields customised his guitars' [[tremolo]] systems,{{sfn|DiPerna|1992|p=26}} resulting in the band pioneering an [[alternative rock]] subgenre known as [[shoegazing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/shoegaze-ma0000004454|title=Shoegaze: Significant Albums, Artists and Songs|work=[[AllMusic]]||publisher=All Media Network|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> The term "shoegazing", which was considered derogatory,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/02/28/music/mbv-inspires-japan-to-keep-staring-at-its-feet|title=MBV inspires Japan to keep staring at its feet|work=[[The Japan Times]]|publisher=Nifco|last=Martin|first=Ian|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> was coined by ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' journalists in the late 1980s to describe certain bands' "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor".{{sfn|McGonial|2007|p=31}}

==Release and reception==
''Ecstasy'' was released on 25&nbsp;November 1987&nbsp;on Lazy Records. It received a limited edition release of 3,000&nbsp;LP copies{{sfn|Moore|2006|p=238}} distributed by [[Rough Trade Records]] and went [[out of print]] within three months of its release.<ref name="ss" /> The album entered the [[UK Indie Chart|UK Independent Albums Chart]] in December 1987&nbsp;and spent four weeks in total on the chart, peaking at number 12.{{sfn|Lazell|1997|p=155}} The contents of the album were later combined with the band's preceding single, "Strawberry Wine", and reissued on the compilation album ''[[Ecstasy and Wine]]'', released in February 1989&nbsp;on Lazy Records. ''Ecstasy and Wine'', however, was released without the band's consent and Kevin Shields retrieved 10,000&nbsp;LP copies from the manager of Lazy Records soon after its release. Shields sold the records to various distributors in the early 1990s, after My Bloody Valentine were dropped from [[Creation Records]], and used the funds to finance later recording sessions.<ref name="bh" />

Upon its release, ''Ecstasy'' received moderate critical acclaim. ''[[Melody Maker]]'' referred to the album as "a series of aloof, pastel washes of sound, suspended guitars, words from the back of beyond tying in to a large, shifting whole" and "larger than the sum of its parts".<ref name="mm" /> In ''Loveless'', a book from the [[33<U+2153>]]&nbsp;series about the My Bloody Valentine [[Loveless (album)|album of the same name]], Mike McGonial referred to ''Ecstasy'' as a "rarified, effete and poppy approach to [[The Byrds|Byrdsian]] rock"{{sfn|McGonial|2007|p=24}} and [[AllMusic]] rated the album two and a half out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ecstasy-mw0000843238|title=Ecstasy <U+2013> My Bloody Valentine: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=All Media Network|last=Aldrich|first=Steve|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> In a separate review of ''Ecstasy and Wine'', AllMusic writer Bradley Torreano described ''Ecstasy'' as the point where the band "started moving toward [[Cocteau Twins]] territory, using guitarist Bilinda Butcher's airy voice to define their image" and when "Shields and Butcher [were] exploring the guitar landscapes that would later become their trademark".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ecstasy-and-wine-mw0000454856|title=Ecstasy and Wine <U+2013> My Bloody Valentine: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=All Media Network|last=Torreano|first=Bradley|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref>

On ''Ecstasy''{{'}}s supporting tour, My Bloody Valentine conceived the idea of "the holocaust", an interlude of noise and excessive feedback during live performances which was later attributed to their song "[[You Made Me Realise]]" and often exceeded 130[[Decibel|dB]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7132-my-bloody-valentine|title=Articles: My Bloody Valentine &#124; Features|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|last=Ewing|first=Tom|date=23 June 2008|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> The band toured small student venues and, according to Kevin Shields, at "one particular place, there were these guy playing pool in the background, shouting amongst themselves and being quite loud and not paying attention". Before performing "Clair", Shields said to the band "let's just do it until those guys stop" and performed a two-chord riff in the song that lasted for an approximate 30&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2013/08/interview_kevin_shields_my-bloody-valentine.php|title=My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields on the early days of the band, using synths and tape-loops|work=[[Westword]]|publisher=[[Voice Media Group]]|last=Murphy|first=Tom|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>
