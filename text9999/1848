Bennett died in [[Freestone County]] on October 20, 1848.<ref>Huntsville Banner 1848</ref> He was buried on his Headright land in the family cemetery.

In approximately 1971, the cemetery was bulldozed by the landowner at the time. Descendants of Bennett, concerned about the destruction contacted authorities. Freestone County Sheriff J.R. "Sonny" Sessions and Constable Lee Cherry visited the site shortly after the incident.

In a report written by then Sheriff of Freestone County J.R. "Sonny" Sessions, he observed the following:

''"The land owners were contacted but denied any knowledge of the act. Constable Cherry returned to the scene some months later and found nothing remained, he believed the brush piles and markers had been buried as nothing found. We did not see Col. Bennett's marker which was said to be large and impressive"'' - ''J.R. "Sonny" Sessions, Sheriff''<ref>Freestone Past and Present -  J. R. (Sonny) Sessions Sheriff 1965-2001</ref>

==Historical Markers==
The J.L. Bennett Homesite in Montgomery County is no longer in existence but a Texas Historical Marker has been placed near the location. Located on Texas State Highway 105, 1.5&nbsp;miles east of Montgomery (just east of Walden Road).

''Joseph L. Bennett, who came to Texas in 1834 and settled in this area, joined the Texas army in early 1836. As captain of a company of local volunteers, he left this area about March 1, 1836, to lead his troops to aid Texan forces at the Alamo. Upon reaching the Colorado River he learned of the fall of the Alamo, and so discontinued the mission. He soon joined with Sam Houston's main army and was elected Lt. Colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Volunteers, the company he commanded at the Battle of San Jacinto. Bennett received land grants in payment for his military service, and in 1837 President Sam Houston appointed him to command a frontier defense unit. Elected by Montgomery County voters to the Republic of Texas Congress, he served for two terms, 1838-1840. He briefly resumed military service in 1842 as a member of the Somervell Expedition against Mexico. Bennett also was active in local civic affairs, serving as mail carrier from Houston to Montgomery county commissioner and supporter of area schools. He moved his family to his headright land grant in present Navarro and Freestone counties in 1848. He died later that year and was buried in a family graveyard near Streetman.''
