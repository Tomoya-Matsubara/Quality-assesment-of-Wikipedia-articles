The '''wildebeest''', also called the '''gnu''',  is an [[antelope]] in the genus '''''Connochaetes'''''. It belongs to the family [[Bovid]]ae, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned [[ungulate]]s. ''Connochaetes'' includes two species, both native to Africa: the [[black wildebeest]], or white-tailed gnu (''C. gnou''); and the [[blue wildebeest]], or brindled gnu (''C. taurinus''). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more in order to adapt to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring and in the way their horns are orientated. 

In East Africa, the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big [[Game (food)|game]] species and some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over a short period of time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large [[carnivore]]s. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with [[zebra]] which gives heightened awareness of potential [[Predation|predators]]. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as [[baboon]]s. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The [[IUCN]] lists both species as being of "[[least concern]]".

==Classification==
===Taxonomy and evolution===
The wildebeest, or the genus ''Connochaetes'', is placed under family [[Bovidae]] and subfamily [[Alcelaphinae]], where its closest relatives are the [[Alcelaphus|hartebeest]] (''Alcelaphus'' spp.), the [[hirola]] (''Beatragus hunteri'') and species in the genus ''[[Damaliscus]]'', such as the [[topi]], the [[Common tsessebe|tsessebe]], the [[blesbok]] and the [[bontebok]].<ref name=msw3/> The name ''Connochaetes'' was given by German [[zoologist]] [[Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein]] in 1814.<ref name=msw3/><ref name=groves>{{cite book|last=Groves|first=C.|title=Ungulate Taxonomy |year=2011 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=1-4214-0093-6|coauthors=Grubb, P.}}</ref> Wildebeest were first discovered about 1700 by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] settlers on their way to the interior of South Africa. Due to their resemblance to wild cattle, these people called them "wild ox" or "wildebeest". The black wildebeest was first known to westerners in the northern part of South Africa a century later, in the 1800s.<ref name=talbot>{{cite book|last1=Talbot |first1=L. M. |last2=Talbot |first2= M. H. |title=Wildlife Monographs:The Wildebeest in Western Masailand, East Africa|year=1963|publisher=National Academies |pages=20<U+2013>31}}</ref>

In the early twentieth century, one species of the wildebeest, ''Connochaetes albojubatus'', was identified in eastern Africa. In 1914, two separate races of the wildebeest were introduced, namely ''Gorgon a. albojubatus'' (Athi white-bearded wildebeest) and ''G. a. mearnsi'' (Loita white-bearded wildebeest). However, in 1939, the two were once again merged into a single race, ''Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus''. In the mid-twentieth century, two separate forms were recognised, ''Gorgon taurinus hecki'' and ''G. t. albojubatus''.<ref name=talbot/> Finally two distinct types of wildebeest - the blue and black wildebeest - were identified. The blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus, ''Gorgon'',<ref name=nowak/><ref name=corbet>{{cite journal|last=Corbet|first=S. W.|last2=Robinson |first2= T.

According to an [[mtDNA]] analysis, the black wildebeest seem to have diverged from the main lineage during the [[Middle Pleistocene]] and became a distinct species around a million years ago.<ref name=bassi>{{cite book |last=Bassi |first=J. |title=Pilot in the Wild: Flights of Conservation and Survival |year=2013 |publisher=Jacana Media |isbn=978-1-4314-0871-9 |pages=116<U+2013>118}}</ref> A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated.<ref name=corbet/> The split does not seem to have been driven by [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for resources but instead by the fact that each species adopted a different [[Ecological niche|feeding niche]] and occupied a different [[trophic level]].<ref name=Codron>{{cite journal |author=Codron, Daryl; Brink, James S. |year=2007 |title=Trophic ecology of two savanna grazers, blue wildebeest ''Connochaetes taurinus'' and black wildebeest ''Connochaetes gnou'' |journal=European Journal of Wildlife Research |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=90<U+2013>99 |doi=10.1007/s10344-006-0070-2 }}</ref>

Blue wildebeest fossils dating back some two and a half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the [[Cradle of Humankind]] north of [[Johannesburg]]. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as [[Saldanha Bay|Elandsfontein]], [[Cornelia, Free State|Cornelia]] and [[Florisbad]].<ref name=hb>{{cite book|last=B.|first=Hilton-Barber|title=Field Guide to the Cradle of Humankind : Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai & Environs World Heritage Site|year=2004 |publisher=Struik|location=Cape Town|isbn=978-177-0070-653 |pages=162<U+2013>163 |edition=2nd |coauthors=Berger, L.

Both species of wildebeest are even-toed, horned, greyish-brown ungulates superficially resembling cattle. Males are larger than females and both have heavy forequarters compared to their hindquarters. They have broad muzzles, Roman noses, shaggy manes and tails.<ref name=ulfstrand /> The most striking morphological differences between the black and blue wildebeest are the orientation and curvature of their horns and the color of their coats.

==Distribution and habitat==
Wildebeest inhabit the plains and open woodlands of parts of Africa south of the Sahara. The black wildebeest is native to the southernmost parts of the continent. Its historical range included South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho, but in the latter two countries it was hunted to extinction in the 19th century. It has now been reintroduced to them and also introduced to Namibia where it has become well established.<ref name=iucn1/> It inhabits open plains, grasslands and [[Karoo|Karoo shrublands]] in both steep mountainous regions and lower undulating hills at altitudes varying between {{convert|1350|and|2150|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn1/> In the past, it inhabited the [[highveld]] [[temperate grassland]]s during the dry winter season and the arid Karoo region during the rains. However, as a result of widespread hunting, it no longer occupies its historical range or makes migrations, and is now largely limited to game farms and protected reserves.<ref name=estes1991>{{cite book|last=Estes|first=R. D.|title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates|year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=052-0080-858 |page=133}}</ref>

The blue wildebeest is native to eastern and southern Africa. Its range includes [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Angola]]. It is no longer found in [[Malawi]] but has been successfully reintroduced into [[Namibia]]. Blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia [[savanna]]s, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too dry. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open [[woodland]] floodplains.<ref name=iucn2>{{IUCN2010.2|assessors=IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group|year=2008|id=5229|title=Connochaetes taurinus|downloaded= 11 March 2014}}</ref> In East Africa, the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big [[Game (food)|game]] species, both in population and biomass.<ref name=ulfstrand>{{cite book|last=Ulfstrand|first=Staffan|title=Savannah Lives: Animal Life and Human Evolution in Africa |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> It is a notable feature of the [[Serengeti]] National Park in Tanzania, the [[Masai Mara]] Game Reserve in Kenya and the [[Liuwa Plain National Park]] in Zambia.<ref name="National geographic"/>

===Migration===
[[File:Wbeest Mara.jpg|thumb|Wildebeest herding and following zebra in the [[Serengeti National Park]] ([[Tanzania]]). During these migrations, wildebeest spend 10 months per year in the Serengeti National Park and two months in the [[Masai Mara]], ([[Kenya]]).]]
Not all wildebeest are migratory. Black wildebeest herds are often nomadic or may have a regular home range of {{convert|1|km2|sqft|lk=in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Bulls may occupy territories, usually about {{convert|100|to|400|m|0|abbr=on}} apart, but this spacing varies according to the quality of the habitat.

In the [[Masai Mara]] game reserve, there is a non-migratory population of blue wildebeest which had dwindled from about 119,000 animals in 1977 to about 22,000 in 1997. The reason for the decline is thought to be the increasing competition between cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of grazing land as a result of changes in agricultural practices, and possibly fluctuations in rainfall.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ottichiloa, Wilber K.; de Leeuwa, Jan; Prins, Herbert H.

Each year, some East African populations of blue wildebeest have a long-distance [[wikt:migration|migration]], seemingly timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the rainy season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels.<ref name=ulfstrand /> One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.<ref name=benshahar>{{cite journal|last=Ben-Shahar|first=Raphael|coauthors=Malcolm J.

Numerous documentaries feature wildebeest crossing rivers, with many being eaten by [[crocodile]]s or drowning in the attempt. While having the appearance of a frenzy, recent research has shown a herd of wildebeest possesses what is known as a "[[swarm intelligence]]", whereby the animals systematically explore and overcome the obstacle as one.<ref>[http://tanzanear.com/blog/wildebeest-migration-must-see-on-african-safari-vacation ]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> Major predators that feed on wildebeest include the lion, [[hyena]], [[cheetah]], [[leopard]], and [[crocodile]], which seem to favour the wildebeest.<ref name="National geographic"/> Wildebeest, however, are very strong, and can inflict considerable injury even to a lion. Wildebeest have a maximum running speed of around {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web| last = PBS| title = Animal Guide: Blue Wildebeest| work = Nature| accessdate =8 January 2013| url = http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/animal-guides/animal-guide-blue-wildebeest/3255/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 9780521576734| last = McGowan| first = Christopher| title = A Practical Guide to Vertebrate Mechanics| date = 28 February 1999|page=162}}</ref> The primary defensive tactic is herding, where the young animals are protected by the older, larger ones, while the herd runs as a group. Typically, the predators attempt to cut out a young or ill animal and attack without having to worry about the herd. Wildebeest have developed additional sophisticated cooperative behaviours, such as animals taking turns sleeping while others stand guard against a night attack by invading predators. Wildebeest migrations are closely followed by [[vultures]], as wildebeest carcasses are an important source of food for these scavengers. The vultures consume about 70% of the wildebeest carcasses available. Decreases in the number of migrating wildebeest have also had a negative effect on the vultures.<ref name=Virani>{{cite journal|last=Virani|first=Munir Z.|coauthors=Corinne Kendall, Peter Njoroge, Simon Thomsett|title=Major Declines in the Abundance of Vultures and Other Scavenging Raptors in and around the Masai Mara Ecosystem, Kenya|journal=Biological Conservation |year=2011 |volume=144 |pages=746<U+2013>752 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.10.024 |issue=2}}</ref> In the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, wildebeest may help facilitate the migration of other, smaller-bodied grazers, such as [[Thomson's gazelle]]s (''Eudorcas thomsonii''), which eat the new-growth grasses stimulated by wildebeest foraging.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McNaughton, S.

==Ecology==
===Interactions with nonpredators===
[[Zebra]]s and wildebeest group together in open savannah environments with high chances of predation. This grouping strategy reduces predation risk because larger groups decrease each individual<U+2019>s chance of being hunted, and predators are more easily seen in open areas.<ref name=Thaker>{{cite journal|last=Thaker|first=Maria|coauthors=Abi T.

Wildebeest can also listen in on the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more strongly to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.<ref name=Kitchen>{{cite journal|last=Kitchen|first=Dawn M.|coauthors=Thore J.

===Breeding and reproduction===
[[File:Drink From Mom Wildebeest.ogv|thumb|Video of wildebeest feeding its calf, South Africa]]
Wildebeest do not form permanent pair bonds and during the mating season, or [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]], the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. These small territories are about 3000 m<sup>2</sup>, with up to 300 territories per km<sup>2</sup>. The males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into season. The males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed at the end of the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness.<ref name=ulfstrand /> This usually occurs between May and July, and birthing usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. Wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously.<ref name=Clay>{{cite journal|last=Clay|first=A. Moss|coauthors=R.D. Estes, K.V. Thompson, D.E. Wildt, S.L. Monfort|title=Endocrine Patterns of the Estrous Cycle and Pregnancy of Wildebeest in the Serengeti Ecosystem|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|year=2010 |volume=166 |issue=2 |pages=365<U+2013>371 |doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2009.12.005|pmid=20036667}}</ref> The [[estrous cycle]] is about 23 days and the gestation period lasts 250 to 260 days. The calves weigh about {{convert|21|kg|0|abbr=on}} at birth<ref name=Benirschke/> and scramble to their feet within minutes, being able to move with the herd in a matter of days.<ref name="National geographic"/> Groups of wildebeest females and young live in the small areas established by the male. When groups of wildebeest join together, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose to move to the areas held by a smaller number of males.<ref name=Thaker /> This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance as higher male mortality has been attributed to hunting.<ref name=Nidablema>{{cite journal|last=Ndibalema|first=Vedasto G.|title=A Comparison of Sex Ratio, Birth Periods and Calf Survival among Serengeti Wildebeest Sub-populations, Tanzania |journal=African Journal of Ecology |year=2009 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=574<U+2013>582 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.00994.x}}</ref>

==Threats and conservation==
Today many wildebeest populations are experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are increasingly difficult to maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete, as well. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In one of the more striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size.<ref name=Williamson>{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=D.T.|coauthors=B. Mbano|title=Wildebeest Mortality During 1983 at Lake Xau, Botswana|journal=African Journal of Ecology|year=1988|volume=26|pages=341<U+2013>344|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.1988.tb00987.x}}</ref> Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.<ref name=hybrid1>{{cite journal|last=Grobler|first=J. P.|coauthors=Rushworth, I.; Brink, J. S.; Bloomer, P.; Kotze, A.; Reilly, B.; Vrahimis, S.|title=Management of hybridization in an endemic species: decision making in the face of imperfect information in the case of the black wildebeest<U+2014>''Connochaetes gnou''|journal=European Journal of Wildlife Research|year=2011|volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=997<U+2013>1006 |doi=10.1007/s10344-011-0567-1 |issn=1439-0574}}</ref>

The black wildebeest has been classified as of "[[Least Concern]]" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in its [[Red List of Threatened Species]]. The populations of this species are on an increase. There are now believed to be more than 18,000 individuals, 7,000 of which are in Namibia, outside its natural range, and where it is farmed. Around 80% of the wildebeest occur in private areas, while the other 20% are confined in protected areas. Its introduction into Namibia has been a success and numbers have increased substantially there from 150 in 1982 to 7,000 in 1992.<ref name=iucn1>{{IUCN2010.2|assessors=IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group|year=2008|id=5228|title=Connochaetes gnou|downloaded=25 March 2014}}</ref>

The blue wildebeest has also been rated as being of "[[Least Concern]]". The population trend is stable, and their numbers are estimated to be around 1,500,000 - mainly due to the increase of the populations in [[Serengeti National Park]] (Tanzania) to 1,300,000. However, the numbers of one of the subspecies, the Eastern white-bearded wildebeest (''C. t. albojubatus'') have seen a steep decline. Population density ranges from 0.15/km<sup>2</sup>. in [[Hwange National Park|Hwange]] and [[Etosha National Park|Etosha]] National Parks to 35/km<sup>2</sup>. in [[Ngorongoro Crater]] and Serengeti National Park.<ref name=iucn2>{{IUCN2010.2|assessors=IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group|year=2008|id=5229|title=Connochaetes taurinus|downloaded=25 March 2014}}</ref>

==Uses and interaction with humans==
[[File:Natal Provincial Arms.png|thumbnail|right|80px|The coat of arms of Natal Province]]
Wildebeest provide several useful animal products. The hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.<ref name=nowak/> Wildebeest are killed for food, especially to make [[biltong]] in Southern Africa. This dried game meat is a delicacy and an important food item in Africa.<ref name=ulfstrand /> The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is the most tender during the autumn season.<ref name=hoffman /> Wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find. Cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into 11 pieces. The estimated price for wildebeest meat was about US$ 0.47 per kilogram around 2008.<ref name=Nidabelema1>{{cite journal|last=Ndibalema|first=Vedasto G.|coauthors=Alexander N. Songorwa|title=Illegal Meat Hunting in Serengeti: Dynamics in Consumption and Preferences|journal=African Journal of Ecology|year=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=311<U+2013>319|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.2007.00836.x}}</ref> The silky, flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make [[fly-whisk]]s or "chowries".<ref name=nowak/>

The wildebeest benefit the ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. Nowadays they are economically important for human beings as they are a major tourist attraction as well as providing important products like leather.<ref name=adw>{{cite web|last=Geraci |first=G. |title=''Connochaetes taurinus'' : Blue wildebeest |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Connochaetes_taurinus/ |work=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|publisher=Animal Diversity Web|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> However, the wildebeest can also have a negative impact on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like [[rinderpest]] and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread [[Ticks of domestic animals|ticks]], [[lungworm]]s, [[tapeworm]]s, flies and [[Paramphistomum|paramphistome fluke]]s.<ref name=talbot/>

The black wildebeest is depicted on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Natal Province|Province of Natal]] in South Africa. Over the years the South African authorities have issued several stamps displaying the animal and the South African Mint has struck a two cent piece with a prancing black wildebeest.<ref name=mammal>{{cite journal|last=von Richter|first=W.|title=''Connochaetes gnou''|journal=[[Mammalian Species]]|year=1974|issue=50|pages=1<U+2013>6|publisher=The American Society of Mammalogists}}</ref>
