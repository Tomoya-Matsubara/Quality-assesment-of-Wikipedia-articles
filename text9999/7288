'''Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel''' or '''Ouziel'''  ([[1880]]-[[1953]]) ([[Hebrew]]: '''<U+05D1><U+05DF> <U+05E6><U+05D9><U+05D5><U+05DF> <U+05DE><U+05D0><U+05D9><U+05E8> <U+05D7><U+05D9> <U+05E2><U+05D5><U+05D6><U+05D9><U+05D0><U+05DC>''') was the Sephardi [[chief rabbi]] of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] from [[1939]] to [[1948]], and of [[Israel]] from [[1939]] to [[1954]].

Ben-Zion was born in [[Jerusalem]], where his father, Joseph Raphael, was the ''av bet din'' of the [[Sephardi]] community of Jerusalem, as well as president of the community council. At the age of twenty he became a [[yeshivah]] teacher and also founded a yeshivah called Mahazikei Torah for Sephardi young men. In [[1911]], he was appointed ''hakham bashi'' of [[Jaffa]] and the district. Immediately upon his arrival in Jaffa he began to work vigorously to raise the status of the Oriental congregations there. In spirit and ideas he was close to the [[Ashkenazi]] rabbi of the Jaffa community, [[Abraham Isaac Kook|A. I. Kook]], and their affinity helped to bring about more harmonious relations than previously existed between the two communities. 

During [[World War I]] he was active as a leader and communal worker. His intercession with the [[Turkey|Turkish]] government on behalf of persecuted [[Jews]] finally led to his exile to [[Damascus]] but he was permitted to return to [[Eretz Yisrael]], arriving in Jerusalem before the entry of the British army. In [[1921]] he was appointed chief rabbi of [[Salonika]], accepting this office with the consent of the Jaffa-[[Tel Aviv]] community for a period of three years. He returned to become chief rabbi of Tel Aviv in [[1923]], and in [[1939]] was appointed [[Chief Rabbi]] of Palestine. Ben-Zion was a member of the temporary committee of Jews in Israel, a member of the ''Va'ad Le'ummi'', and a representative at the meeting which founded the [[Jewish Agency]]. He appeared before the [[Palestine (mandate)|Mandatory government]] as a representative of the Jewish community and on missions on its behalf, and impressed all with his dignity and bearing. He was also founder of the yeshivah Sha'ar Zion in Jerusalem. He contributed extensively to newspapers and periodicals on religious, communal, and national topics as well as [[Torah]] ''[[novella]]e'' and [[Jewish philosophy]].

He was the author of: ''Mishpetei Ouziel'', ''[[responsa]]'' (1st ed., 3 vols., 1935<U+2013>60; 2nd ed., 4 vols., 1947<U+2013>64); ''Sha'arei Ouziel'' (1944<U+2013>46), consisting of ''[[halakhah]]'', general topics, and a selection of his addresses, letters, and other writings; ''Mikhmannei Ouziel'' (1939); ''Hegyonei Ouziel'' (1953<U+2013>54), and still other works in manuscript. He made "Love, truth, and peace" the motto of his life. This verse (''[[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]]'' 8:19) hung framed above his desk and was inscribed on his note paper. 

Two days before his death he dictated his testament. It said, ''inter alia'', "I have kept in the forefront of my thoughts the following aims: to disseminate [[Torah]] among students, to love the Torah and its precepts, Israel and its sanctity; I have emphasized love for every man and woman of Israel and for the Jewish people as a whole, love for the Lord God of Israel, the bringing of peace between every man and woman of Israel<U+2014>in body, in spirit, in speech, and in deed, in thought and in meditation, in intent and in act, at home and in the street, in village and in town; to bring genuine peace into the home of the Jew, into the whole assembly of Israel in all its classes and divisions, and between Israel and its Father in Heaven."
