'''Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (born '''Benjamin D'Israeli'''; [[21 December]] [[1804]] &ndash; [[19 April]] [[1881]]) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] statesman and literary figure. He served in government for three decades, twice as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]<U+2014>the first and thus far only person of [[Jew]]ish parentage to do so (although Disraeli was [[baptism|baptised]] in the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] at 13). Disraeli's most lasting achievement was the creation of the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] after the [[Corn Laws]] schism of 1846.

Although a major figure in the [[protectionist]] wing of the Conservative Party after 1844, Disraeli's relations with the other leading figures in the party, particularly [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the overall leader, were often strained. Not until the 1860s would Derby and Disraeli be on easy terms, and the latter's succession of the former assured. From 1852 onwards, Disraeli's career would also be marked by his often intense rivalry with [[William Gladstone]], who eventually rose to become leader of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In this duel, Disraeli was aided by his warm friendship with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who came to detest Gladstone during the latter's first premiership in the 1870s. In 1876 Disraeli was raised to the [[peerage]] as the Earl of Beaconsfield, capping nearly four decades in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. 

Before and during his political career, Disraeli was well-known as a literary and social figure, although his novels are not generally regarded as a part of the Victorian literary [[Western canon|canon]]. He mainly wrote romances, of which ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]'' and ''[[Vivian Grey]]'' are perhaps the best-known today. He was and is unusual among British Prime Ministers for having gained equal social and political renown.

==Early life==
<!--Disraeli's biographers think he's Italian Sephardic. Please provide evidence before changing it-->
[[Image:Isaac disraeli.jpg|thumb|left|caption|'''Isaac D'Israeli'''<br /><small>Father of Benjamin Disraeli</small>]]
Disraeli's biographers believe he was descended from [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Sephardi|Sephardic Jews]]. He claimed [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry, possibly referring to the ultimate origin of his family heritage in [[Spain]] prior to the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of Jews]] in 1492.<ref>Blake, 3. Norman Gash, reviewing Blake's work, argued that Benjamin's claim to Spanish ancestry could not be entirely dismissed. Gash, review of ''Disraeli'', 360<U+2013>364</ref> His father, [[Isaac D'Israeli]], a literary critic and historian, though [[Jew]]ish, in 1817 had Benjamin [[baptism|baptised]] in the [[Church of England]], following a dispute with their [[synagogue]]. The elder D'Israeli (Benjamin changed the spelling in the 1820s by dropping the apostrophe) himself was content to remain outside organized religion.<ref>Opponents, however, continued to include the apostrophe in correspondence. [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|Lord Lincoln]], writing to [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] in 1846, referred to  "D'Israeli." Conancher, "Peel and the Peelites, 1846<U+2013>1850," 435. Peel did so as well, see Gash, ''Peel'', 387. Even in the 1870s, towards the end of Disraeli's career, this practice continued. See Wohl, 381, ff. 22.</ref> Benjamin at first attended a small school, the Reverend John Potticary's school at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]<ref>Rhind, I, 157.</ref> (later to evolve into [[St Piran's School]]). Beginning in 1817, Benjamin attended [[Higham Hall]], in [[Walthamstow]]. His younger brothers, in contrast, attended the superior [[Winchester College]], a fact that grated on Disraeli and may explain his dislike of his mother, [[Maria D'Israeli]].

His father groomed him for a career in law, and Disraeli was articled to a solicitor in 1821. Law was, however, uncongenial, and by no later than 1825 he had given it up. His health at the time was uncertain, and in 1824 Isaac took his son abroad for a tour of [[Belgium]] (then part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]) and the [[Rhine Valley]]. Young Benjamin greatly enjoyed the experience, and later claimed that it was while travelling on the [[Rhine]] that he determined to abandon the law and seek fame and fortune: "I determined when descending those magical waters that I would not be a lawyer." <ref>Blake, 22.</ref> On his return to England he speculated on the stock exchange on various South American mining companies. The recognition of the new South American republics on the recommendation of [[George Canning]] had led to a considerable boom, encouraged by various promoters. In this connection, Disraeli became involved with the financier [[John Diston Powles|J. D. Powles]], one such booster. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies.<ref>Blake, 24<U+2013>26; Veliz, 637<U+2013>663</ref>

That same year Disraeli's financial activities brought him into contact with the publisher [[John Murray (1778-1843)|John Murray]] who, like Powles and Disraeli, was involved in the South American mines.  Accordingly, they attempted to bring out a newspaper, ''[[The Representative]]'', to promote both the cause of the mines and those politicians who supported the mines, specifically Canning. The paper was a failure, in part because the mining "bubble" burst in late 1825, which ruined Powles and Disraeli. Also, according to Disraeli's biographer, [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Lord Blake]], the paper was "atrociously edited", and would have failed regardless. Disraeli's debts incurred from this debacle would haunt him for the rest of his life.<ref>Blake, 33-34.</ref>

===Literary career===
[[Image:Young disraeli.jpg|thumb|caption|'''A Young Disraeli''' <br /><small>by Sir Francis Grant, 1852</small>]]
Disraeli now turned towards literature, motivated in part by a desperate need for money, and brought out his first novel, ''[[Vivian Grey]]'', in 1826. Disraeli's biographers agree that ''Vivian Grey'' was a thinly-veiled re-telling of the affair of the [[The Representative (newspaper)|''Representative'']], and it proved very popular on its release, although it also caused much offence within the Tory literary world when Disraeli's authorship was discovered. The book, initially anonymous, was purportedly written by a "man of fashion" &ndash; someone who moved in high society. Disraeli, then just twenty-three, did not move in high society, and the numerous [[solecism]]s present in ''Vivian Grey'' made this painfully obvious. Reviewers were sharply critical on these grounds of both the author and the book. Furthermore, John Murray believed that Disraeli had caricatured him and abused his confidence&ndash;an accusation denied at the time, and by the official biography, although subsequent biographers (notably Blake) have sided with Murray.<ref>Graubard, 139.</ref>

After producing a ''[[Vindication of the English Constitution]]'', and some political pamphlets, Disraeli followed up ''Vivian Grey'' with a series of novels, ''[[The Young Duke]]'' (1831), ''[[Contarini Fleming]]'' (1832), ''[[Alroy (Disraeli novel)|Alroy]]'' (1833), ''[[Venetia (Disraeli novel)|Venetia]]'' and ''[[Henrietta Temple]]'' (1837). During the same period he had also written ''[[The Revolutionary Epick]]'' and three [[burlesques]], ''[[Ixion (novel)|Ixion]]'', ''[[The Infernal Marriage]]'', and ''[[Popanilla]]''. Of these only ''Henrietta Temple'' (based on his affair with [[Sykes Baronets|Henrietta Sykes]], wife of [[Sykes Baronets|Sir Francis William Sykes, 3rd Bt]]) was a true success.

During the 1840s Disraeli wrote three political novels collectively known as "the Trilogy"&ndash;''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil]]'', ''[[Coningsby (novel)|Coningsby]]'', and ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred]]''.

Disraeli's relationships with other male writers of his period were strained or non-existent. After the disaster of ''The Representative'' [[John Gibson Lockhart]] became a bitter enemy and the two never reconciled.<ref>Cline, "Disraeli and John Gibson Lockhart," 134<U+2013>137.</ref> Disraeli's preference for female company prevented the development of contact with those who were otherwise not alienated by his opinions, comportment or background. One contemporary who tried to bridge the gap, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], established a tentative cordial relationship in the late 1840s only to see everything collapse when Disraeli took offence at a burlesque of him which Thackeray penned for ''Punch''. Disraeli took revenge in ''Endymion'' (published in 1880), when he caricatured Thackeray as "St. Barbe".<ref>Cline, "Disraeli and Thackeray," 404<U+2013>408. This view has been accepted by most historians. See Merritt, 85<U+2013>88, who argues that St. Barbe was an attack on [[Thomas Carlyle]].</ref>

Critic [[William Kuhn]] argued that much of Disraeli's fiction can be read as "the memoirs he never wrote," revealing the inner life of a politician for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket <U+2013> particularly with regard to his allegedly "ambiguous sexuality."<ref>Dugdale, "Strike out."</ref>

==Parliament==
[[Image:Robert Peel.jpg|left|thumb|caption|'''Sir Robert Peel, Bt.'''<br /><small>Prime Minister 1834<U+2013>35, 1841<U+2013>46</small>]]
Disraeli had been considering a political career as early as 1830, before he departed England for the [[Mediterranean]]. His first real efforts, however, did not come until 1832, during the great crisis over the [[Reform Bill of 1832|Reform Bill]], when he contributed to an anti-[[British Whig Party|Whig]] pamphlet edited by [[John Wilson Croker]] and published by Murray entitled ''England and France: or a cure for Ministerial Gallomania''. The choice of a Tory publication was regarded as odd by Disraeli's friends and relatives, who thought him more of a [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]]. Indeed, Disraeli had objected to Murray about Croker inserting "high Tory" sentiment, writing that "it is quite impossible that anything adverse to the general measure of Reform can issue from my pen." Further, at the time ''Gallomania'' was published, Disraeli was in fact electioneering in [[High Wycombe]] in the Radical interest.<ref>Robert Blake, ''Disraeli'', (New York, 1966), 84<U+2013>86.</ref> Disraeli's politics at the time were influenced both by his rebellious streak and by his desire to make his mark. In the early 1830s the Tories and the interests they represented appeared to be a lost cause. The other great party, the Whigs, was anathema to Disraeli: "Toryism is worn out & I cannot condescend to be a Whig."<ref>Blake, 87</ref>

Though he initially stood for election, unsuccessfully, as a Radical, Disraeli was a [[Tory]] by the time he won a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1837 representing the constituency of [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]]. The next year he settled his private life by marrying [[Mary Disraeli, 1st Viscountess Beaconsfield|Mary Anne Lewis]], the widow of Wyndham Lewis, Disraeli's erstwhile colleague at Maidstone.

[[Image:Lord John Manners.jpg|right|thumb|caption|'''Lord John Manners'''<br /><small>Friend of Disraeli, and leading figure in the [[Young England]] movement</small>]]
Although a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the demands of the [[Chartists]] and argued for an alliance between the landed aristocracy and the working class against the increasing power of the merchants and new industrialists in the middle class, helping to found the [[Young England]] group in 1842 to promote the view that the landed interests should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by middle-class businessmen. During the twenty years between the [[Corn Laws]] and the Second Reform Bill Disraeli would seek a Tory-Radical alliance, to little avail. Prior to the 1867 Reform Bill the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little tangible political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with [[John Bright]], a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to convince Bright to sacrifice principle for political gain. After one such attempt, Bright noted in his diary that Disraeli "seems unable to comprehend the morality of our political course."<ref>Trevelyan, 207. The specific occasion was the 1852 Budget. Disraeli seems to have held out the possibility of Bright, [[Richard Cobden]], and [[Thomas Milner Gibson]] eventually joining the cabinet in exchange for the support of the Radicals.</ref>

=== Protection ===
[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] passed over Disraeli when putting together his [[First Peel ministry|government]] in 1841 and Disraeli, hurt, gradually became a sharp critic of Peel's government, often deliberately adopting positions contrary to those of his nominal chief.<ref> Peel's reasons for doing so are disputed. Some historians suggest Edward Stanley's well-known antipathy to Disraeli as the prime factor. Robert Blake dismisses these claims, arguing instead that Peel's need to balance the various factions of the Conservative Party, and the heavy preponderance of aristocrats within the cabinet, precluded Disraeli's inclusion. See Cline, "Disraeli and Peel's 1841 Cabinet" 509<U+2013>512 and Blake, 165<U+2013>166.</ref>  The best known of these cases was the [[Maynooth grant]] in 1845 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The end of 1845 and the first months of 1846 were dominated by a battle in parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over the repeal of the Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and [[Lord George Bentinck]]. An alliance of pro free-trade Conservatives (the "Peelites"), Radicals, and Whigs carried repeal, and the Conservative Party split: the [[Peelites]] moved towards the Whigs, while a "new" Conservative Party formed around the protectionists, led by Disraeli, Bentinck, and [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] (later Lord Derby).

This split had profound implications for Disraeli's political career: almost every Conservative politician with official experience followed Peel, leaving the rump bereft of leadership. As one biographer wrote, "[Disraeli] found himself almost the only figure on his side capable of putting up the oratorical display essential for a parliamentary leader."<ref>Blake, 247</ref> Looking on from the House of Lords, the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] wrote that Disraeli "was like a [[subaltern]] in a great battle where every superior officer was killed or wounded."<ref>Quoted in Blake, 247<U+2013>248</ref> If the remainder of the Conservative Party could muster the electoral support necessary to form a government, then Disraeli was now guaranteed high office. However, he would take office with a group of men who possessed little or no official experience, who had rarely felt moved to speak in the House of Commons before, and who, as a group, remained hostile to Disraeli on a personal level, his assault on the Corn Laws notwithstanding.<ref>Blake, 260.</ref>

=== Bentinck and the Leadership ===
[[Image:Lord George Bentinck.jpg|left|thumb|caption|'''Lord George Bentinck'''<br /><small>Conservative leader in the commons 1846<U+2013>48</small>]]
In 1847 a small political crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from the leadership and highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1847|preceding general election]], [[Lionel de Rothschild]] had been returned for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]]. Ever since Catholic Emancipation, members of parliament were required to swear the oath "on the true faith of a Christian." Rothschild, an unconverted Jew, could not do so and therefore could not take his seat. [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild a member for the City of London, introduced a [[Jewish Disabilities Bill]] to amend the oath and permit Jews to enter Parliament.

Disraeli spoke in favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was "completed Judaism," and asking of the House of Commons "Where is your Christianity if you do not believe in their Judaism?"<ref>Hansard, 3rd Series, xcv, 1321-1330, December 16, 1847.</ref> While Disraeli did not argue that the Jews did the Christians a favor by killing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], as he had in ''Tancred'' and would in ''[[Lord George Bentinck (book)|Lord George Bentinck]]''<ref>{{cite book

One member who was not, Lord John Manners, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. Bentinck, then still Conservative leader in the Commons, joined Disraeli in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration.<ref>Blake, 259-260.</ref>

In the aftermath of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and feuded with Stanley, leader in the Lords and overall leader, who had opposed the measure and directed the party whips&ndash;in the Commons&ndash;to oppose the measure as well. Bentinck was succeeded by [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Lord Granby]]; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being.<ref>Blake, 261-262.</ref> Even as these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase [[Hughenden Manor]], in [[Buckingham]] county. This purchase allowed him to stand for the county, which was "essential" if one was to lead the Conservative Party at the time. He and [[Mary Anne Disraeli, 1st Viscountess Beaconsfield|Mary Anne]] alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the remainder of their marriage. These negotations were complicated by the sudden death of Lord George on September 21, 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of [[Pound (currency)|<U+00A3>]]25,000 (equivalent to almost <U+00A3>1,500,000 today) from Lord George's brothers [[Lord Henry Bentinck]] and [[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland|Lord Titchfield]].<ref>Blake, 251-254.</ref>

Within a month Granby resigned the leadership in the commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without an actual leader in the commons for the remainder of the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and [[John Charles Herries]]&ndash;indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted the man. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.<ref>Blake, 266-269.</ref>

== Office ==
====The first Derby government====
[[Image:14th Earl of Derby.jpg|left|thumb|'''The Earl of Derby'''<br /><small>Prime Minister 1852, 1858<U+2013>59, 1866<U+2013>68</small>]] 
{{main|Who? Who? Ministry}}
The first opportunity for the protectionist Tories under Disraeli and Stanley to take office came in 1851, when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell's]] [[First Russell Ministry|government]] was defeated in the House of Commons over the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851]]. Disraeli was to have been [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], with Stanley (becoming the ''Earl of Derby'' later that year) as Prime Minister. Other possible ministers included [[Robert Inglis|Sir Robert Inglis]], [[Henry Goulburn]], [[John Charles Herries]], and [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]]. The [[Peelites]], however, refused to serve under Stanley or with Disraeli so long as the question of [[free trade]] remained unsettled, and attempts to form a purely protectionist government failed. Derby supposedly remarked at the time, "Pshaw! These are not names which I can put before the Queen!"<ref>Blake, 301<U+2013>305.</ref>

Russell resumed office, but resigned again in early 1852 when a combination of the protectionists and [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] defeated him on a Militia Bill.<ref>Palmerston got his "tit for tat" with "Johnny Russell," who under pressure from the Crown had dismissed Palmerston from the Foreign Office the previous December.</ref> This time [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] (as he had become) took office, and to general surprise appointed Disraeli [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].<ref>The expectation had been that Disraeli would assume the Foreign or Home offices.</ref> Disraeli had offered to stand aside as leader of the House of Commons in favour of Palmerston, but the latter declined.

The primary responsibility of a mid-Victorian chancellor was to produce a Budget for the coming fiscal year. Disraeli proposed to reduce taxes on [[malt]] and [[tea]] ([[indirect taxation]]); additional revenue would come from an increase in the [[house tax]]. More controversially, Disraeli also proposed to alter the workings of the [[income tax]] ([[direct taxation]]) by "differentiating"&ndash;i.e., different rates would be levied on different types of income.<ref>Ghosh, 269<U+2013>273; Matthew, "Budgets," 621.</ref> The establishment of the income tax on a permanent basis had been the subject of much inter-party discussion since the fall of Peel's ministry, but no consensus had been reached, and Disraeli was criticised for mixing up details over the different "schedules" of income. Disraeli's proposal to extend the tax to [[Ireland]] gained him further enemies, and he was also hampered by an unexpected increase in defence expenditure, which was forced on him by Derby and [[John Pakington, 1st Baron Hampton|Sir John Pakington]] ([[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]]) (leading to his celebrated remark to [[John Bright]] about the "damned defences").<ref>Bright's diary quotes the conversation in full. See Trevelyan, 205<U+2013>206</ref> This, combined with bad timing and perceived inexperience led to the failure of the Budget and consequently the fall of the government in December of that year.<ref>On the centrality of the income tax, see Matthew, Gladstone, 121-122.</ref>

[[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s final speech on the failed Budget marked the beginning of over twenty years of mutual parliamentary hostility, as well as the end of Gladstone's formal association with the Conservative Party. No Conservative reconciliation remained possible so long as Disraeli remained leader in the House of Commons.

==== Opposition ====
With the fall of the government Disraeli and the Conservatives returned to the opposition benches. Derby's successor as Prime Minister was the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], whose ministry was composed of both Peelites and Whigs. Disraeli himself was succeeded as chancellor by Gladstone.

====The second Derby government====
{{main|Second Derby Ministry}}
[[Image:Palmerston.jpg|left|thumb|'''The Viscount Palmerston'''<br /><small>Prime Minister 1855-58, 1859<U+2013>65</small>]]
[[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]'s [[First Palmerston ministry|government]] collapsed in 1858 amid public fallout over the [[Felice Orsini|Orsini affair]] and Derby took office at the head of a purely 'Conservative' administration. He again offered a place to Gladstone, who declined. Disraeli remained leader of the House of Commons and returned to the Exchequer. As in 1852 Derby's was a [[minority government]], dependent on the division of its opponents for survival.<ref>Hawkins, 79<U+2013>105.</ref> The principal measure of the 1858 session would be a bill to re-organise governance of India, the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]] having exposed the inadequacy of dual control. The first attempt at legislation was drafted by the [[President of the Board of Control]], [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], who had previously served as [[Governor-General of India]] (1841<U+2013>44). The bill, however, was riddled with complexities and had to be withdrawn. Soon after, Ellenborough was forced to resign over an entirely separate matter involving the current Governor-General, [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]].<ref>Blake, 379<U+2013>382.</ref>

Faced with a vacancy, Disraeli and Derby tried yet again to bring Gladstone into the government. Disraeli wrote a personal letter to Gladstone, asking him to place the good of the party above personal animosity: "Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than ourselves, that disposes of all this<U+2026>" In responding to Disraeli Gladstone denied that personal feelings played any role in his decision then and previously to accept office, while acknowledging that there were differences between him and Derby "broader than you may have supposed." Gladstone also hinted at the strength of his own faith, and the role it played in his public life, when he addressed Disraeli's most personal and private appeal: 

{{cquote|I state these points fearlessly and without reserve, for you have yourself well reminded me that there is a Power beyond us that disposes of what we are and do, and I find the limits of choice in public life to be very narrow.&mdash;W. E. Gladstone to Disraeli, 1858<ref>Blake, 382<U+2013>384.</ref>}}

With Gladstone's refusal Derby and Disraeli looked elsewhere and settled on Disraeli's old friend [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], who became [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]; Derby's son [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], succeeded Ellenborough at the Board of Control. Stanley, with Disraeli's assistance, proposed and guided through the house the India Act, under which the subcontinent would be governed for sixty years. The East India Company and its Governor-General were replaced by a [[Viceroy of India|viceroy]] and the Indian Council, while at Westminster the [[Board of Control]] was abolished and its functions assumed by the newly-created India Office, under the [[Secretary of State for India]].<ref>Blake, 385<U+2013>386.</ref>

====The 1867 Reform Bill====
{{main|Third Derby Ministry}}
After engineering the defeat of a Liberal Reform Bill introduced by Gladstone in 1866, Disraeli and Derby introduced their own measure in 1867. [[Image:Gladstone.jpg|right|thumb|'''William Ewart Gladstone'''<br /><small>Four-time Prime Minister</small>]]This was primarily a political strategy designed to give the Conservative party control of the reform process and the subsequent long-term benefits in the Commons, similar to those derived by the Whigs after their 1832 Reform Act. The [[Reform Act of 1867]] extended the franchise by 938,427 <U+2014> an increase of 88% <U+2014> by giving the vote to male householders and male lodgers paying at least 10 pounds for rooms and eliminating [[rotten borough]]s with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and granting constituencies to fifteen unrepresented towns, and extra representation in parliament to larger towns such as Liverpool and Manchester, which had previously been under-represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].<ref>Conancher, "The Emergence of British Parliamentary Democracy in the Nineteenth Century", 177</ref> This act was unpopular with the right wing of the Conservative Party, most notably [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]] (later the '''Marquess of Salisbury'''), who resigned from the government and spoke against the bill, accusing Disraeli of "a political betrayal which has no parallel in our Parliamentary annals."<ref>Quoted in Blake, 473.</ref> Cranborne, however, was unable to lead a rebellion similar to that which Disraeli had led against Peel twenty years earlier.

==Prime Minister==
{{main|Premiership of Benjamin Disraeli}}
====First government====
{{main|First Disraeli ministry}}
Derby's health had been declining for some time and he finally resigned as Prime Minister in late February of 1868; he would live for twenty months. Disraeli's efforts over the past two years had dispelled, for the time being, any doubts about him succeeding Derby as leader of the Conservative Party and therefore Prime Minister. As Disraeli remarked, "I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole."<ref>Blake, 485<U+2013>487.</ref> [[Image:3rd Marquess of Salisbury.jpg|left|thumb|'''The Marquess of Salisbury'''<br /><small>Three-time Prime Minister</small>]]

However, the Conservatives were still a minority in the House of Commons, and the passage of the Reform Bill required the calling of new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister would therefore be fairly short, unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] as [[Lord Chancellor]] with [[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Lord Cairns]], and brought in [[George Ward Hunt]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Disraeli and Chelmsford had never got along particularly well, and Cairns, in Disraeli's view, was a far stronger minister.<ref>Blake, 487<U+2013>489.</ref>

Disraeli's first premiership was dominated by the heated debate over the [[Established Church|established]] [[Church of Ireland]]. Although [[Ireland]] was overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]], the [[Protestant]] Church remained the established church and was funded by direct taxation. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with [[Henry Edward Cardinal Manning|Cardinal Manning]] the establishment of a Roman Catholic university in [[Dublin]] foundered in March when [[William Gladstone|Gladstone]] moved resolutions to dis-establish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal divided the Conservative Party while reuniting the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under Gladstone's leadership. While Disraeli's government survived until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|December general election]], the initiative had passed to the Liberals, who were returned to power with a majority of 170.<ref>Blake, 496<U+2013>502.</ref>

====Second government====
{{main|Second Disraeli ministry}}
After six years in opposition, Disraeli and the Conservative Party won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|election of 1874]], giving the party its first absolute [[majority government|majority]] in the House of Commons since the 1840s. Under the stewardship of [[Richard Assheton Cross|R. A. Cross]], the [[Home Secretary]], Disraeli's government introduced various reforms, including the [[Artisan's and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875]], the [[Public Health Act 1875]], the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876). His government also introduced a new [[Factory Act]] meant to protect workers, the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]] to allow peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As a result of these social reforms the [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]] MP Alexander Macdonald told his constituents in 1879:

<blockquote>"The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty."<ref>William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, ''The Life of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume II. 1860&ndash;1881'' (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 709.</ref></blockquote>

====Imperialism====
{{main|Eastern Question}}
[[Image:old disraeli.jpg|right|thumb|Disraeli and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], during the latter's visit to [[Hughenden]] at the height of the Eastern crisis.]]
Disraeli was a staunch supporter of the expansion and preservation of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]].  Over the objections of his own cabinet and without the Parliament's consent, he obtained a short-term loan from [[Lionel de Rothschild]] in order to purchase 44% of the shares of the [[Suez Canal Company]]. 

Disraeli and Gladstone clashed over Britain's Balkan policy. Disraeli saw the situation as a matter of British imperial and strategic interests, keeping to [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]]'s policy of supporting the Ottoman Empire against Russian expansion. According to Blake, Disraeli believed in upholding Britain's greatness through a tough, "no nonsense" foreign policy that put England's interests above the "moral law" that advocated emancipation of small nations.<ref>Blake, p. 760.</ref> Gladstone, however, saw the issue in moral terms, for Bulgarian Christians had been massacred by the Turks and Gladstone therefore believed it was immoral to support the Ottoman Empire. Blake further argued that Disraeli's imperialism "decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else".<ref>Blake, p. 760.</ref>

A leading proponent of [[the Great Game]], Disraeli introduced the [[Royal Titles Act 1876]], which created Queen Victoria [[Empress of India]], putting her at the same level as the Russian Tsar. In his private correspondence with the Queen, he proposed "to clear [[Central Asia]] of Muscovites and drive them into the [[Caspian]]".<ref>Quoted from Disraeli's letter to the Queen in Mahajan, 53.</ref> In order to contain Russia's influence, he launched an invasion of [[Afghanistan]] and signed the [[Cyprus Convention]] with Turkey, whereby this strategically placed island was handed over to Britain. 

Disraeli scored another diplomatic success at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, in preventing Bulgaria from gaining full independence, limiting the growing influence of [[Russia]] in the [[Balkans]] and breaking up the [[League of the Three Emperors]]. However, difficulties in South Africa (epitomised by the defeat of the British Army at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]), as well as Afghanistan, weakened his government and led to his party's defeat in the 1880 election.

====Title and death====
Disraeli was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876 when [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] (who liked Disraeli both personally and politically) made him '''Earl of Beaconsfield''' and '''Viscount Hughenden'''.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|general election of 1880]] Disraeli's Conservatives were defeated by Gladstone's Liberals, in large part owing to the uneven course of the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].  Disraeli became ill soon after and died in April 1881.
He is buried in a vault beneath St Michael's Church in the grounds of his home [[Hughenden Manor]], accessed from the churchyard. Against the outside wall of the church is a memorial erected in his honour by Queen Victoria. His [[literary executor]], and for all intents and purposes his heir, was his private secretary, [[Montagu Corry, 1st Baron Rowton|Lord Rowton]].

==Personal life and family==
Benjamin was the second child and eldest son of [[Isaac D'Israeli]] and [[Maria Basevi]]. His siblings included Sarah (1802&ndash;1859), Naphtali (1807), Ralph (1809&ndash;1898), and James (1813&ndash;1868).<ref>''Ibid'', 3.</ref>

Before his entrance into parliament Disraeli was involved with several different women, most notably Lady Henrietta Sykes (the wife of Sir Francis Sykes, Bt), who served as the model for ''Henrietta Temple''. His relationship with Henrietta would eventually cause him serious trouble beyond the usual problems associated with a torrid affair. It was Henrietta who introduced Disraeli to [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst|Lord Lyndhurst]], with whom she later became romantically involved. As Lord Blake observed: "The true relationship between the three cannot be determined with certainty<U+2026>there can be no doubt that the affair [figurative usage] damaged Disraeli and that it made its contribution, along with many other episodes, to the understandable aura of distrust which hung around his name for so many years."<ref>''Ibid'', 116<U+2013>119.</ref>

In 1839 Disraeli married [[Mary Disraeli, 1st Viscountess Beaconsfield|Mary Anne Wyndham Lewis]], widow of [[Wyndham Lewis (politician)|Sir Wyndham Lewis]]. Mary Lewis was 12 years his senior, and, in spite of this, their marriage was a success. Originally their union was seen as being based on financial interests only, which may be true. However, they came to cherish one another.

===Disraeli's Judaism===
Although born of Jewish parents, Disraeli was baptised in the Christian faith at the age of thirteen, and remained an observant Anglican for the rest of his life.<ref>Blake, 11. See also Endelman, 115.</ref> At the same time, he considered himself ethnically Jewish and did not view the two positions as incompatible.
