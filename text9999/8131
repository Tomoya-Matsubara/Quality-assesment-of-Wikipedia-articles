'''Imad Fayez Mughniyah''' (7 December 1962 <U+2013> 12 February 2008), also [[transliterate]]d '''Mughniyya''', '''Mughniyeh''', '''Mogniyah''' ({{lang-ar|<big><U+0639><U+0645><U+0627><U+062F> <U+0641><U+0627><U+064A><U+0632> <U+0645><U+063A><U+0646><U+064A><U+0629></big>}}), [[Pseudonym|alias]] '''al-Hajj Radwan''' (<big><U+0627><U+0644><U+062D><U+0627><U+062C> <U+0631><U+0636><U+0648><U+0627><U+0646></big>), was a senior member of [[Lebanon]]'s [[Hezbollah]] organisation. He was alternatively described as the head of its security section, a senior intelligence official and as one of the founders of the organisation. Mugniyah has been associated with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Beirut barracks bombing]] and [[1983 United States embassy bombing|US embassy bombings]], both of which took place in 1983 and killed over 350, as well as the kidnapping of dozens of foreigners in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was indicted in [[Argentina]] for his alleged role in the 1992 [[Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires]]. The highest-profile attacks for which it is claimed he is responsible took place in the early 1980s, shortly after the founding of Hezbollah. He is thought to have killed more [[United States]] citizens than any other militant before the [[2001 US attacks]], and the bombings and kidnappings he is alleged to have organized are credited with all but eliminating the [[US military]] presence in Lebanon in the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Lebanon&article=662 "Mughnieh murder could trigger retaliation", By Nicholas Blanford - TCSM, 16 February 2008]</ref>

Information about him is limited.

==Biography==
Mughniyah was born in Tayr Dibba to a family of poor farmers who harvested olives and lemons in the orchards of Lebanon's southern Shi'a heartland.<ref name=Peraino/> [[CIA]] South Group records state that Mughniyah lived in Ayn Al-Dilbah, a slum in South [[Beirut]].<ref name = "Baer">{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert_Baer|year=2002

Mughniyeh is described as having been a popular boy and a "natural entertainer" who cracked jokes at family weddings and "worked the crowd with a confidence unusual for a youth his age."<ref name=Peraino>{{cite web|title=The Fox is Hunted Down|author=Kevin Peraino|publisher=Newsweek|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/112771?from=rss|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>

Mughniyah became active in the Palestinian Fatah movement at an early age. He was discovered by fellow Lebanese Ali Abu Hassan Deeb (who would later become a leader in Hizbullah) and quickly rose through the ranks of the movement.<ref name = Akhbar/> In the mid-1970s, Mugniyah organized the "Student Brigade," a unit of 100 young men which became part of [[Yasser Arafat]]'s elite [[Force 17]].<ref name=Peraino/> Mughniyah temporarily left Fatah in 1981 due to differences of opinion on the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Mughniyah was a Shiite and deeply religious and was upset by the murder of the Iraqi Grand Ayatullah [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]] in 1980 as well as a previous attempt by the Iraqi intelligence on the life of Lebanese Ayatullah [[Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah]].<ref name=Akhbar>{{cite news|url= http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/4445|title = <U+0628><U+0639><U+0636> <U+0645><U+0646> <U+0633><U+064A><U+0631><U+0629> <U+0633><U+0627><U+062D><U+0631> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0642><U+0627><U+0648><U+0645><U+0629> (About the life of the magician of the resistance)|publisher=Al Akhbar|author= Ibrahim al-Amin|date= 17 February 2012|accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>

Fatah was formally in alliance the [[Lebanese National Movement]], which included the Lebanese pro-Iraqi branch of the [[Ba'ath Party|Ba<U+2019>th party]]. Mughniyah and some of his Lebanese Shiite comrades were forced to leave Fatah after engaging in armed confrontations with Ba<U+2019>th party activists. They had previously organized a body guard unit for Ayatullah Fadlallah and other Shiite clerics in Lebanon. Mughniyah accompanied Ayatullah Fadlallah on a [[Hajj]] pilgrimage in 1980 and thus earned his Hajj title.<ref name=Akhbar/>

Mughniyeh was a student in the engineering department at the [[American University of Beirut]]<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |first=James|last=Risen|title= A Nation Challenged: A Suspect; U.S. Traces Iran's Ties to Terror Through a Lebanese|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEFDB1138F934A25752C0A9649C8B63&|work=[[New York Times]] |date=17 January 2002|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> in 1981 when the United States gave the "green light" for Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon in pursuit of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].<ref name=Morris>{{cite web|title=The Assassination of Mughniyeh: A Death in Damascus|date=25 February 2008|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/morris02252008.html|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref>

When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 Mughniyah was in Iran but hurried back to Beirut where he rejoined Fatah and participated in the defence of West Beirut and was wounded in the fighting. After the withdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut in September 1982 Mughniyah acquired an important position in the nascent resistance to the Israeli occupation due to his knowledge of arms cashes left behind by the Palestinians. He remained a Fatah member during this period but also worked with other factions, such as the leftist Lebanese National Movement and Islamic resistance groups. Mughniyah remained a member of Fatah until 1984 when he joined the newly created [[Islamic Resistance]] of the Hezbullah. He remained however close to Fatah leader [[Khalil al-Wazir]] (Abu Jihad) until the latter<U+2019>s death in 1988. He also remained deeply committed to the Palestine cause throughout his life and apparently founded a secret "Committee for Elimination of Israel" (<U+0644><U+062C><U+0646><U+0629> <U+0644><U+0625><U+0632><U+0627><U+0644><U+0629> <U+0625><U+0633><U+0631><U+0627><U+0626><U+064A><U+0644>) inside the Hizbullah in 2000. In later years, and especially after the Oslo accords, Mughniyah and the Hizbullah sided with the more militant Palestinian factions such as [[Hamas]] and the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]].<ref name = Akhbar/>

Mughniyah worked as the bodyguard for Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a spiritual mentor to many in Lebanon's Shi'a community whose political consciousness was on the rise. Fadlallah held no formal political role, "opposed violence and sectarian division, and defied growing Iranian influence in Lebanon."

===Personal life===
In 1983, Mughniyah married to his cousin Saada Badr Al Din who is the sister of [[Mustafa Badr Al Din]].<ref name=nspecial>{{cite news|title=Car bomb kills Imad Mugniyah, <U+201C>The Fox<U+201D>|url=http://www.nation.lk/2008/02/17/special5.htm|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=Nation Special|date=17 February 2008}}</ref> Mughniyah had two children from this marriage: Fatima Mugniyah (born August 1984) and Mustafa Mugniyah (born January 1987).<ref name=nspecial/> In September 1991, Mugniyah<U+2019>s wife and children were sent to Tehran for security reasons.<ref name=nspecial/>

==Allegations==
Mughniyah was accused of terrorist attacks in the 1980s and 1990s, primarily against [[United States|American]] and [[Israel]]i targets. These allegations include the 18 April 1983 [[April 1983 US Embassy bombing|bombing of the United States embassy]] in [[Beirut, Lebanon]], which killed 63 people including 17 Americans. Agreement is not universal on Mughniyah's involvement as  [[Caspar Weinberger]], the Secretary of Defense at the time, told [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 2001, "We still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn't then."<ref name=Morris/>

Mughniyah was fingered as the mastermind of the 23 October 1983 simultaneous [[truck bomb]]ings against French paratroopers and the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks]], attacks which killed 58 French soldiers and 241 Marines.<ref name="CSM">{{Cite journal|title=U.S. warship stirs Lebanese fear of war|author=Nicholas Blanford|journal=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=4 March 2008|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/0304/p01s01-wome.html }}</ref><ref name=cnn10101>{{cite news|title=U.S. renews bid to catch Beirut bombing suspect|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/10/09/ret.mughniyah.link/|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=10 October 2001}}</ref> On 20 September 1984, he is alleged to have attacked the US embassy annex building.

Mughniyah was also linked to numerous [[Lebanon hostage crisis|kidnappings of Westerners]] in Beirut through the 1980s, most notably that of [[Terry A. Anderson|Terry Anderson]], [[Terry Waite]], and [[William Francis Buckley]], who was the CIA station chief in Beirut. Some of these individuals were later killed, such as Buckley, who was hideously tortured and eventually murdered.<ref>Martin, David C. and Walcott, John, "Best Laid Plans: The Inside Story of America's War Against Terrorism," Harper & Row, (1988), pp. 154-55, 233</ref>  The remainder were released at various times with the last one, Terry Anderson, released in 1991. It is also believed that he took advantage of his status as a student in the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB) to enable him to assassinate Malcolm Kerr, president of the AUB, on campus in 1984. His stay at AUB as an engineering student was financed by a political organisation. Mugniyah has also been tied to the [[Khobar Towers bombing]] in 1996, which killed 19 Americans and one Saudi citizen.<ref name=jgoldberg/>

On 30 September 1985, Mughniyah allegedly organized the kidnapping of four diplomats from the Soviet Embassy in Beirut, one of whom he soon personally killed. The result of this kidnapping was Soviet pressure on Syria to stop its operations in Northern Lebanon in exchange for release of the remaining three hostages.<ref>[http://svr.gov.ru/smi/2001/ogon20011022.htm Interview with former Beirut KGB resident Yuri Perfilev]</ref> On 8 March 1985, the CIA carried out a [[1985 Beirut car bombing|reprisal operation]] funded by the Saudis, for the Marine barracks bombing of 1983, in which they attempted to kill Fadlallah by car-bombing. The cleric escaped harm, but the huge explosion wounded 200 and killed 62 in the poor Shi'a neighbourhood where he lived. Among the dead were Imad Mughniya's brother and some of Fadlallah's bodyguards and close friends.<ref name=Morris/> [[Roger Morris (American writer)|Roger Morris]] claims that this was a "turning point" in Mughniyeh's life and that it was after this event that he "joined the terrorist arm of the increasingly militant political impulse among Lebanon's Shi'ah from which Hezbollah soon emerged, and as the resistance movement's chief of security and intelligence, he joined one of history's more vicious chain reactions."<ref name=Morris/> In 1993, Mughniyah was introduced to [[Osama Bin Laden]] by [[Al Qaeda]] operative Ali Muhammad in [[Somali]].<ref name=twt1293>{{cite news|title=Deadly infiltrator<U+2019>s trail|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/sep/12/20030912-080854-6898r/|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=12 September 2003}}</ref>

Mughniyah was formally charged by [[Argentina]] due to his involvement in the 17 March 1992 [[Israeli Embassy Attack in Buenos Aires|bombings of the Israeli embassy]] in [[Buenos Aires]], which killed 29 and the [[AMIA Bombing|AMIA cultural building]] in July 1994, killing 86 people.<ref>Norton, Augustus Richard, ''Hezbollah: A Short History,''  Princeton University Press, 2007, p. 79</ref>  He has also been accused of orchestrating the 2000 capture of three Israeli soldiers in the northern part of Israel and the kidnapping of Israeli businessman [[Elchanan Tenenbaum]], and of killing eight soldiers and abducting two in the [[2006 Lebanon War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

While the long international hunt for Mughniyah produced many allegations, they were denied or dismissed by Hezbollah. In a July 2003 interview, Hezbollah leader Sheikh [[Hassan Nasrallah]] told ''[[Time Magazine]]'' that the US accusations against Mughniyah were "just accusations," and he questioned whether they could provide evidence to condemn Mughniyah. Nasrallah also stated that, "Hajj Imad is among the best freedom fighters in the Lebanese arena. He had a very important role during the occupation [of southern Lebanon by Israel]. But as for his relationship with Hezbollah, we maintain the tradition of not discussing names."<ref name=Blanford>{{cite news|title=Hizballah Mourns Its Shadowy Hero|author=Nicholas Blanford|date=13 February 2008|accessdate=18 February 2008|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1713020,00.html?xid=feed-cnn-world|work=Time}}</ref>

According to [[Robert Baer]], "Mughniyah is probably the most intelligent, most capable operative we<U+2019>ve ever run across, including the KGB or anybody else. He enters by one door, exits by another, changes his cars daily, never makes appointments on a telephone, never is predictable. He only uses people that are related to him that he can trust. He doesn<U+2019>t just recruit people."<ref name=kohn/> He was described as "tall, slender, well-dressed and handsome ... penetrating eyes," speaking some English but better French.<ref>According to hostage David Jacobsen. Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'', Simon and Schuster, (2001), p.274</ref>

==Organizational affiliation==
Mugniyah has been allegedly linked to [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] operations such as the [[Karine A]] incident in 2002, where the [[Palestinian Authority]] was accused of importing fifty tons of weapons. He was a member of ''[[Force 17]]'', an armed branch of the [[Fatah]] movement charged with providing security for [[Yasser Arafat]] and other prominent [[PLO]] officials.<ref name=darling>{{cite news|last=Darling|first=Dan|title=Mind of Mugniyeh|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/466aubsk.asp|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=The Weekly Standard|date=25 July 2006}}</ref> 

In mid-February 1997, the pro-Israeli [[South Lebanese Army]] radio station reported that Iran's intelligence service had dispatched Mughniyah to Lebanon to directly supervise the reorganisation of Hezbollah's security apparatus concerned with Palestinian affairs in Lebanon and to work as a security liaison between Hezbollah and Iranian intelligence. Mughniyah also reportedly controlled Hezbollah's security apparatus, the Special Operations Command, which handles intelligence and conducts overseas terrorist acts. Allegedly, although he used Hezbollah as a cover, he reported to the Iranians.<ref>Rex A. Hudson, Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, September 1999 [http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/frd.html The Sociology and Psychology of Terrorism: Who becomes a terrorist and why?] Accessed 17 August 2006</ref> According to Jeffery Goldberg, writing in the ''New Yorker'', "It is believed that Mugniyah takes orders from the office of Iran<U+2019>s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, but that he reports to a man named Ghassem Soleimani, the chief of a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps called Al Quds, or the Jerusalem Force<U+2014>the arm of the Iranian government responsible for sponsoring terror attacks on Israeli targets."<ref name=jgoldberg>{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Jeffrey|title=In the party of God|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/10/28/021028fa_fact2?currentPage=all|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=28 October 2002}}</ref> 

The European Union lists him as "Senior Intelligence Officer of Hezbollah".<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/>

==Arrest warrants and attempted assassination==
Various law enforcement agencies attempted to capture Mughniyah. The United States tried to secure his capture in [[France]] in 1986, but were thwarted by French refusal to detain him.

The United States tried to capture him several times afterward, beginning with a 1995 operation that was put in place after it was realized Mughniyah was flying a [[Middle East Airlines]] [[charter flight]] [[A-310 Airbus]] from [[Khartoum]] to [[Beirut]] after a meeting with several militant leaders, and was scheduled to make a stop-over in Saudi Arabia. But Saudi airport officials refused to allow the plane to make its stop-over, thwarting American bids to arrest Mughniyah.<ref name="katz">Katz, Samuel M. "Relentless Pursuit: The DSS and the manhunt for the al-Qaeda terrorists", 2002</ref>

The next year, U.S. military personnel planned to seize him off a ship in [[Doha, Qatar]], but the operation was called off. This plan, dubbed Operation RETURN OX, was carried out by ships and sailors of Amphibious Squadron Three ([[USS ''Tarawa'']], [[USS ''Duluth'']], [[USS ''Rushmore'']]), Marines of the [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit]], and Navy SEALs assigned to the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet]]. The operation was underway, but was canceled at the last minute when it could not be verified that Mughniyah was actually on board the Pakistani ship.

On 10 October 2001, Mughniyah appeared on the initial list of the FBI's top 22 [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists|Most Wanted Terrorists]], which was released to the public by President Bush, with a reward of up to $5 million offered for information leading to his arrest.<ref>BBC News, 10 October 2001 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1591997.stm America's 'most wanted terrorists'] Accessed 17 August 2006</ref> This reward remained outstanding as of 2006.<ref name="FBI"/><ref>Rewards for Justice [http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/wanted_captured/index.cfm?page=Mugniyah Imad Fayez Mugniyah] Accessed 17 August 2006</ref>

The Israeli government made several alleged attempts to assassinate Mughniyah. His brother Fuad Mugniyah was killed in a [[1994 Beirut car bombing]] and another brother, Jihad, was killed in a car-bombing assassination attempt on the life of Hezbollah founder [[Sheikh Fadlallah]] in 1985, this one rumored to be the work of the CIA via the South Lebanese Army. Jeffrey Goldberg in ''The New Yorker'' magazine<ref name=jgoldberg/> suggested that Mugniyah attended a meeting between Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] and Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. He was there representing Hezbollah in Lebanon. Mugniyah had been informed that he was at the top of a US military and CIA assassination list. For this reason, he was said to avoid certain areas of Beirut for fear of being killed by CIA operators.

==Assassination==
[[Image:Mughniyah assassination.png|thumb|right|The fire immediately after the car bomb went off.]]

According to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', Mughniyah was at a reception marking the 29th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution hosted by Iranian ambassador to Syria, Hojatoleslam Ahmad Musavi.<ref name=SundayTimes/> Mughniyah left at 10:35 pm and went to his silver [[Mitsubishi Pajero]] nearby.

===Views about perpetrators=== 
On 27 February 2008, ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'' reported that several Arab states helped the Mossad carry out the bombing.<ref>{{cite news|title='Arabs helped Mossad kill Mughniyeh'|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1203847481137&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=27 February 2008|accessdate=27 February 2008}}</ref> Accounts cited by ''the Jerusalem Post'' state that Mughniyeh was assassinated in revenge for the [[2006 Lebanon War]], which he had a role in instigating. Mossad tasked the Kidon Division, a unit of assassins which operates under the Caesarea Branch, with the mission. An account stated that a team of operatives entered [[Damascus]], where they waited for Mughniyeh. When Mughniyeh walked past a car which had been loaded with explosives, it was detonated. The blast caused the entire street to shake, and Mughniyeh<U+2019>s body parts were later found scattered across the street. His assassination took Hezbollah completely by surprise, particularly Sheikh [[Hassan Nasrallah]], the organization<U+2019>s leader.<ref name="jpost.com"/> Israel officially denied being behind the killing.<ref name=Telegraph/> The U.S. Director of National Intelligence [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]] suggested that was also possible that internal Hezbollah factions or Syria may be to blame for the killing.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/954800.html U.S. spy chief: Hezbollah may be behind Mughniyah killing]</ref>

Without naming a source, the German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' said<ref>{{cite news|title=Die Welt report: Assef Shawkat attempted a coup in Syria|Ya Libnan|Lebanon News Live from Beirut|url=http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/06/die_welt_report.php|publisher=Ya Libnan|date=8 June 2008|accessdate=31 August 2008}}</ref> a story had been circulated amongst German diplomatic staff that it was possible that associates of late [[Assef Shawkat]] had assassinated Mughniyah<ref>{{cite news|title=Report: Syria foiled attempted coup by Assad's brother-in-law|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/990938.html|publisher=Haaretz|date=8 June 2008|accessdate=31 August 2008}}</ref> in revenge for having tipped the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, about coup plot against him, which the Syrian government had foiled a couple of days before Mugniyah's assassination. Releasing the story in advance of going to print, ''Die Welt'' said the Syrian embassy in Berlin had rejected the coup story as utterly untrue.

The Kuwaiti newspaper ''Al-Rai'' reported that Hezbollah sources said they would retaliate for Mughniyah's death by assassinating Israeli leaders.<ref>{{cite news|title=Report: Hizballah threatens to assassinate Israeli leaders |url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/default.aspx?tabid=178&nid=15253|publisher=Israel Today|date=18 February 2008|accessdate=18 February 2008}}</ref>

The assassination of Mughniyah was condemned in some parts of the world.

When polled shortly afterwards, over 61 percent of Lebanese believed Hezbollah's retaliation for Imad Mugniyah's killing by Israel would be justified.<ref name=ptvnop/>

The Bush administration welcomed news of his death. A spokesman of the U.S. State Department said: "The world is a better place without this man in it. He was a coldblooded killer, a mass murderer and a terrorist responsible for countless innocent lives lost. One way or another he was brought to justice."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/13/israelandthepalestinians.usa|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Car bomb kills Hizbullah chief in Syria|first=James|last=Sturcke|date=13 February 2008|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> Danny Yatom, former head of the Israeli Mossad said: "He was one of the most dangerous terrorists ever on Earth." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021300494.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Bombing Kills Top Figure in Hezbollah|first1=Anthony|last1=Shadid|first2=Alia|last2=Ibrahim|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>
