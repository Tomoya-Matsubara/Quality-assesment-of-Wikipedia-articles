==History==
[[File:Port-of-Wilmington-Delaware-1920s.jpg|left|thumb|Aerial view of Wilmington Marine Terminal showing cargo-handling facilities, ca. 1920s.]]
The first development of a marine terminal in Wilmington was completed in 1923 at the location of the current Port of Wilmington. A number of improvements and expansions were made to the port over the course of the following decades. In 1972, [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]] made the port its "principal North American port-of-discharge" for bananas and [[pineapples]]. Four years later, [[Volkswagen of America]] chose the port as its hub for imports of Volkswagen, [[Audi]], and [[Porsche]] automobiles to North America and the Port of Wilmington constructed a floating dock to receive these products. In June 1995, the state of Delaware purchased the port from the city of Wilmington and created [[Diamond State Port Corporation]] to operate the facility. In October 2007, the Port of Wilmington became the first port to implement the [[Transportation Worker Identification Credential]].<ref>{{cite book
