'''Charles Robert "Chuck" Gardiner''' (December 31, 1904&nbsp;<U+2013> June 13, 1934) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[professional]] [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]] who played for the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in the [[National Hockey League]]. Born in [[Edinburgh, Scotland|Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], Gardiner moved with his family to Canada as a child. Playing all of his junior hockey in or around [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Gardiner joined the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in the 1927<U+2013>28 season. He played seven seasons with Chicago, winning two [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina Trophies]], earning three berths to the [[NHL All-Star Team|First All-Star team]], and a berth to the Second All-Star team. In 1934, Gardiner became the only NHL goaltender to captain his team to a Stanley Cup win. A few months after winning the Cup, Gardiner died from a brain hemorrhage brought on by a tonsillar infection, at the age of 29. He became posthumously a charter member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1945.

==Early life==
Born in [[Edinburgh, Scotland|Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], Gardiner moved to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] with his family at age seven, in 1911.<ref name="b202"/> Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. A poor skater, he played goaltender as a child. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten.<ref name="b200">{{harvnb|Allen|Duff|Bower|2002|p=200}}</ref> By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the [[Selkirk Fishermen]].<ref name="mb1">{{cite web|url=http://www.halloffame.mb.ca/honoured/1989/cGardiner.htm|title=Honoured Members<U+2014>Charlie Gardiner|publisher=Manitoba Hall of Fame and Museum}}</ref>
