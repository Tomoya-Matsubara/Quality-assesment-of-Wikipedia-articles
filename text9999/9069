==Decline and fall==

During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper. Social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for women's rights.<ref>Barman (1999), p.319</ref> The country had greatly changed in the five decades since Pedro II's accession to the throne. The [[liberalism]] adopted by successive Government cabinets favored [[Private sector|private initiatives]] and resulted in decades of economic prosperity.<ref>Sodr<U+00E9>, p. 197</ref> Brazil's [[international trade]] reached a total value of Rs 79.000:000$000 (see [[Economy of the Empire of Brazil#Currency|Brazilian currency]]) between 1834 and 1839. This continued to increase every year until it reached Rs 472.000:000$000 between 1886 and 1887 (an annual growth rate of 3.88% since 1839).<ref>Sodr<U+00E9>, p. 201</ref> Brazilian economic growth, especially after 1850, compared well with that of the United States and European nations.<ref>Fausto (2005), p.50</ref> The national revenue, which amounted to Rs 11.795:000$000 in 1831, rose to Rs 160.840:000$000 in 1889. By 1858, it was the eighth largest in the world.<ref>Lyra (v.1), p.200</ref> The [[per capita income]] in 1880 was roughly equivalent to that of the United States.<ref>Nobrega, p.105 "Em 1880, a renda per capita do Brasil era ainda semelhante <U+00E0> americana."</ref> To give an idea of the economic potential of the country during the Empire, if "it had been able to sustain the level of productivity achieved in 1780 and managed to increase exports at a pace equal to that verified in the second half of 19th century, its ''per capita'' income in 1950 would be comparable to the the average per capita income of the [[Western Europe|Western European]] nations".<ref>''[[Barsa (encyclopedia)|Enciclop<U+00E9>dia Barsa]].

Development on an immense scale occurred during this period, which anticipated similar initiatives in European countries.<ref>Lyra (v.2), p.13</ref><ref>Vasquez (2007), p.38</ref> In 1850, there were 50 factories valued at more than Rs 7.000:000$000. At the end of the Imperial period in 1889, Brazil had 636 factories (representing an annual rate of increase of 6.74% from 1850) valued at approximately Rs 401.630:600$000 (annual growth rate of 10.94% since 1850).<ref>Vianna, p.496</ref> The first railroad line with only 15 kilometers was opened on 30 April 1854<ref>Calmon (2002), p.222</ref> at a time when many European countries had no rail service.<ref>Lyra (v.2), p.13</ref> By 1868, there were 718 kilometers of railroad lines<ref>Calmon (2002), p.225</ref>, and by the end of the Empire in 1889, this had grown to 9,200 kilometers (with another 9,000 kilometers under construction).<ref>Calmon (2002), p.226</ref> Brazil was the fifth country in the world to install modern [[sewer]]s in cities, the third to have [[sewage treatment]],<ref>Lyra (v.2), p.13</ref> and one of the pioneers in installing [[telephone]] lines.<ref>Lyra (v.2), p.309</ref> Beyond these, it was the first South American nation to adopt public electric illumination (in 1883)<ref>Vainfas, p.539</ref> and the second in the Americas (behind the United States) to estabilish a [[telegraph]]ic line connecting it directly to Europe (in 1874).<ref>Lyra (v.2), p.13</ref> The first telegraph line appeared in 1852 in Rio de Janeiro. By 1889, there were 18,925 kilometers of telegraph lines connecting the country's capital to distant Brazilian provinces such as [[Par<U+00E1>]], and even linking to other South American countries such as [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].<ref>Calmon (2002), p.366</ref>

The Brazilian Empire was admired internationally for its democratic system and for its respect for freedom of speech.<ref>Carvalho (2007), p. 86</ref> In politics there were "solid and competitive parties, an active parliament, a [[Freedom of the press|free press]], [[Freedom of speech|open debate]]".<ref>Carvalho (1993), p. 65</ref> The [[Argentina|Argentine]] President [[Bartolom<U+00E9> Mitre]] called the country a "crowned democracy" and [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] President [[Juan Pablo Rojas Pa<U+00FA>l|Rojas Pa<U+00FA>l]] after learning of the emperor's fall said, "It has ended the only republic that existed in [South] America: the Empire of Brazil."<ref>Calmon (2002), p.217</ref> The Brazil of the last year of Pedro II's reign was a "prosperous and [internationally] respected" nation<ref>Lima, p.87</ref> which held unchallenged leadership in Latin America.<ref>Lyra (v.2), p. 9</ref> Its navy was the fifth or sixth most powerful in the world in 1889<ref>Calmon (2002), p.265</ref> with the most powerful battleships in the [[western hemisphere]].<ref>Parkinson, Roger.

The British Prime Minister [[William Gladstone]] said that Pedro II was "a model to the Sovereigns of the world" and held him as being a "great and good Sovereign".<ref>Lyra (v.2), p.259</ref> Brazilian writer [[Machado de Assis]] would later remember him as "a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect."<ref>Vainfas, p.201</ref> When he became emperor in 1831, Brazil was on the verge of fragmentation. Fifty-eight years later, the country had been at peace for more than four decades, slavery had been extinguished, the representative system was consolidated, and the [[Civilian control of the military|leadership of the military was in civilian hands]] (something not seen in the Spanish-American countries).<ref>Carvalho, (2007), p.222</ref> Indeed, for "the longevity of his government and the transformations which occurred during its course, no other Head of State has marked more deeply the history of the nation."<ref>Carvalho (2007), p.9</ref> Even though Brazil was richer and more powerful than ever, though it enjoyed an excellent international reputation, and though Pedro II himself was still extremely popular among his subjects, the Brazilian monarchy itself was dying.

===Republicanism===
[[Republicanism]] as an enduring political movement appeared in Brazil during December 1870 in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] with the publishing of a [[manifesto]] signed by 57 people and with the creation of the Republican Club.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.127">Carvalho (2007), p.127</ref><ref name="Bueno, p.238">Bueno, p.238</ref><ref>Lyra (v.3), p.120</ref> It represented an "insignificant minority of scholars."<ref>Sodr<U+00E9>, p.324</ref> There was no repudiation of or desire for eliminating slavery in the manifesto.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.127"/> In 1873, the Republican Party of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] was created, and it affirmed that slavery would have to be resolved by the monarchist (Conservative and Liberal) parties. The reason for this was because many of the republicans from S<U+00E3>o Paulo were themselves slave-owning farmers.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.128">Carvalho (2007), p.128</ref> The objective of most republicans was to wait until the death of Pedro II and by a [[plebiscite]] or other peaceful means, prevent Princess Isabel from ascending the throne.<ref name="Bueno, p.238"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.208">Carvalho (2007), p.208</ref><ref>Besouchet, p.518</ref> Republicanism did not envisage any "social readjustment" (such as improving the quality of life for former-slaves), and they "were not revolutionaries in the deep meaning of the word."<ref>Besouchet, p.516</ref> The republican movement "had a slow and irregular evolution, concentrated in the provinces south of Bahia"<U+2014>more precisely in the provinces of S<U+00E3>o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]].<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.128"/> It was "an extremely small group"<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.121">Lyra (v.3), p.121</ref> with a "precarious organization in the provinces"<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.206">Carvalho (2007), p.206</ref> and no cohesion or connection among themselves.<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.121"/> The only republican faction to achieve political clout was the Republican Party of S<U+00E3>o Paulo, which managed to elect two deputies to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1884,<ref name="Bueno, p.238"/> though none were elected to the Empire's last legislature in 1889.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.206"/> In the 1880s "it attracted sympathy in lesser numbers than [slavery] abolitionism, and at a slower pace."<ref name="Olivieri, p.50">Olivieri, p.50</ref> Its numbers only increased after 1888, adding new adherents consisting of farmers who had been slave owners and who perceived themselves victims of an unjust abolition of slavery that had not included any type of indemnity to them.<ref name="Olivieri, p.50"/><ref>Schwarcz, p.457</ref><ref>Besouchet, p.505</ref> Even so, in 1889 the "avowed republicans were probably a small minority"<ref name="Munro, p.279">Munro, p.279</ref> as the "republican ideals, in reality, had never managed to seduce the people. Its dissemination was restricted to the intellectual and military fields."<ref>Ermakoff, p.189</ref>
[[Image:Pedro II angelo agostini.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Caricature penciled by  [[Angelo Agostini]] to ''Revista Illustrada'' (Illustrated Magazine) mocking the lack of interest from Pedro II in politics by the end of his reign.]]
As "the republicans themselves recognized, the party did not have size, organization and popular support enough to overthrow the monarchy."<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.208"/> Republicanism "did not manage, at any moment of its development, to spur the national soul. It never had the stature to provoke a strong enthusiasm or enlist all forces that were divorcing from the throne."<ref>Sodr<U+00E9>, p.321</ref> Even with radical propaganda and little interference from the authorities, the Republican Party in existence from the beginning of the 1870s was a small one.<ref name="Munro, p.279"/> It praised republics such as the [[United States]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Argentina]], while conveniently ignoring progressive monarchies such as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[Nordic countries|Scandinavian countries]].<ref>Besouchet, p.503</ref> In 1889, its members were "spokesmen in public squares and writers of periodicals. They were far from having the power to develop a propaganda that could shake the foundations of the throne."<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.122">Lyra (v.3), p.122</ref> In the "political process of the second empire [reign of Pedro II], the republican party had such a dull and secondary role that it might even have been forgotten; it was unable to influence rationales advocating the regime's dissolution."<ref>Sodr<U+00E9>, p.326</ref> It was the crisis between the military and the Government, "of very diverse origin and evolution" from the republicanism, which was to prove the main factor in the fall of the monarchy.<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.122"/>

Pedro II showed no interest in the republican manifesto of 1870.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.128"/> The [[Jos<U+00E9> Ant<U+00F4>nio Pimenta Bueno, Marquis of S<U+00E3>o Vicente|Marquis of S<U+00E3>o Vicente]], then [[President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil|President of the Council of Ministers]], suggested to the Emperor that republicans be forbidden to enter into public service, a practice then common in monarchies. Pedro II answered, "Mr. S<U+00E3>o Vicente, allow the nation to govern itself and decide whatever [monarchy or republic] they want."<ref>"''Sr. S<U+00E3>o Vicente, o pa<U+00ED>s que se governe como entender e d<U+00EA> raz<U+00E3>o a quem tiver.''"</ref> The President reprimanded the monarch, "Your Majesty does not have a right to think in that way. The Monarchy is a constitutional doctrine which Your Majesty swore to maintain; it is not incarnate in the person of Your Majesty." But the Emperor did not care and simply answered: "Well, if the Brazilians do not want me as their Emperor, I shall become a teacher instead!"<ref>Carvalho (2007), p.129</ref><ref name="Lyra v.3, p.126">Lyra (v.3), p.126</ref>

The Emperor not only always refused to forbid republicans from becoming public servants, but also hired the republican military officer [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] as a professor of mathematics to his grandsons.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.209">Carvalho (2007), p.209</ref> He allowed open republican activities, including newspapers, assemblies, meetings and political parties,<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.126"/> and exempted republican deputies elected to the Chamber of Deputies from swearing allegiance to the crown.<ref>Besouchet, p.519</ref> The [[freedom of the Press]], "one of the foundations of the regime, kept allowing fierce criticisms and vile caricatures opposing the regime and its public personalities."<ref name="Besouchet, p.508">Besouchet, p.508</ref> Pedro II was intransigent in his defense of the unrestricted [[freedom of speech]]<ref name="Besouchet, p.508"/> which had existed in Brazil since independence in 1822.<ref>Besouchet, p.515</ref> He was accused of being excessively tolerant towards the republicans,<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.209"/> but "he did not pay attention to several warnings stating that his behavior undermined the political foundation of the monarchy."<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.209"/> In 1889, Pedro II said to [[Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Saraiva]] that he would not mind if Brazil became a republic.<ref>Carvalho (2007), p.204</ref><ref>Besouchet, p.504</ref> The "Emperor's indifference towards the fate of the regime was also one of the main factors in the fall of the Monarchy."<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.126"/>

===Fall===
On 9 November 1889, a large number of officers gathered in the Military Club and decided to stage a [[coup d<U+2019>etat]] aimed at the overthrow of the monarchy.<ref>Lyra (v.3), p.91</ref> Two days later in the house of [[Rui Barbosa]] a plan to execute the coup was drawn up by officers who included [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] and Marshal [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], plus two civilians: [[Quintino Bocai<U+00FA>va]] and [[Aristides Lobo]].

Upon learning of the revolt, the [[President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil|President of the Council of Ministers]] [[Afonso Celso]], Viscount of Ouro Preto, and the other Cabinet ministers went to Army Headquarters, located at the Field of Santana in the heart of the capital.<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.93"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.216"/><ref name="Barman 1999, p.358">Barman (1999), p.358</ref> The supposedly loyal troops there outnumbered and were better equipped than the rebel force.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.358"/> The adjutant-general [Commander] of the Army, Marshal [[Floriano Peixoto]] guaranteed his men's loyalty to Ouro Preto, but he was secretly in alliance with the rebels.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.216"/> Floriano and the Minister of the War [[Rufino En<U+00E9>ias]], Viscount of Maracaj<U+00FA> (a cousin of Deodoro) ignored repeated orders from Ouro Preto to attack the rebels who were approaching the headquarters.<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.93"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.216"/> He tried to convince them, recalling the acts of bravery by the Brazilian military in the [[War of the Triple Alliance]].

===Departure to exile===
On Saturday 16 November, the imperial family were confined in the palace, surrounded by a cavalry regiment.<ref name="Carvalho 2007 p.218"/><ref name="Lyra v.3, p.111">Lyra (v.3), p.111</ref> Pedro II continued reading scientific magazines and appeared calm throughout the day.<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.111"/> At 3 p.m, Major [[Frederico Sol<U+00F3>n Sampaio Ribeiro]] informed the Imperial Family that the Republic had been proclaimed and that they must leave the country for exile within 24 hours.<ref name="Schwarcz, p.459"/><ref>Carvalho (2007),  p.218-219</ref> The "republicans had no courage to meet the Emperor, whom they secretly admired, face to face"<ref>Besouchet, p.540</ref> and therefore sent low-ranking officers to communicate with him.<ref name="Schwarcz, p.459"/> Sol<U+00F3>n, when complimenting the emperor, called him first "Your Excellency", then "Your Highness" and lastly "Your Majesty".<ref name="Schwarcz, p.459"/><ref name="Lyra v.3, p.110">Lyra (v.3), p.110</ref><ref>Calmon (1975), p.1616</ref> Although clearly deposed, the emperor was still much respected by those around him, as illustrated by the parley between him and Sol<U+00F3>n.<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.110"/><ref>Sol<U+00F3>n: "I come on behalf of the Provisional Government, to respectfully deliver to Your Majesty this message.

The emperor: "Yes."</ref><ref name="Calmon 1975, p.1617">Calmon (1975), p.1617</ref> The notice of banishment caused the women to weep, while the men struggled to remain calm<U+2014>with the exception of Pedro II, who remained impassive.<ref name="Schwarcz, p.460"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.218"/><ref name="Lyra v.3, p.110"/><ref name="Calmon 1975, p.1617"/> The monarch resolved to travel the afternoon of the following day and sent a written message to the Provisional Government stating that he agreed to leave the country.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.361"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.218"/><ref name="Calmon 1975, p.1611"/><ref name="Lyra v.3, p.111"/><ref>Schwarcz, p.461-462</ref>

The republican Government feared that demonstrations in favor of the emperor might erupt on Monday 17 November.<ref>Olivieri  p.53</ref><ref name="Schwarcz, p.461">Schwarcz, p.461</ref><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.219">Carvalho (2007),  p.219</ref><ref>Calmon (1975), p.1622</ref> The lieutenant colonel [[Jo<U+00E3>o Nepomuceno de Medeiros Mallet]] was sent at dawn to inform the imperial family that it must leave immediately.<ref>Lyra (v.3), p.112-113</ref> A commotion arose among those present until Pedro II himself appeared in the room. Mallet respectfully told him that the Government had asked them to depart at once. The emperor refused to leave immediately,<ref name="Schwarcz, p.461"/><ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.219"/><ref>The emperor: "What is this? So I will have to embark at his hour of the night?" Mallet respectfully told him that the Government asked them to depart immediately. The emperor: "What Government?" Mallet: "The Government of the Republic." The emperor: "Is Deodoro involved in this?" Mallet: "Yes, Sire. He is the Head of the Government." Pedro II: "You are all off your heads!"</ref><ref>Lyra (v.3), p.113</ref><ref>Besouchet, p.545</ref><ref>Calmon (1975), p.1625-1626</ref> claiming that he was not a slave trying to escape in the middle of the night.<ref>Lyra (v.3), p.114 "N<U+00E3>o sou nenhum fugido, n<U+00E3>o sou nenhum fugido!"</ref><ref>Calmon (1975), p.1626 "N<U+00E3>o sou negro fugido. N<U+00E3>o embarco nesta hora!"</ref> Mallet tried to persuade him, alleging that republican students would launch violent demonstrations against him. The emperor seemed skeptical: "Who gives credence to students?"<ref name="Calmon 1975, p.1626">Calmon (1975), p.1626</ref> At that moment, shots were heard outside. Mallet left the palace to find out what had happened. Fifteen imperial sailors had attempted to land in support of the emperor but were overpowered and imprisoned by republican troops. Mallet returned to the building and deceived Pedro II by saying that militant republicans had tried to attack him and his family.<ref name="Calmon 1975, p.1626"/> Astonished, the emperor agreed to leave.<ref name="Calmon 1975, p.1626"/><ref>Barman (1999), p.362</ref><ref name="Lyra v.3, p.114">Lyra (v.3), p.114</ref>

When Pedro II left the palace, the soldiers who were standing guard outside instinctively presented arms, and he responded by raising his hat.<ref name="Lyra v.3, p.114"/> A few close friends voluntarily accompanied the imperial family into exile, including Andr<U+00E9> Rebou<U+00E7>as and [[Franklin D<U+00F3>ria]], Baron of Loreto.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.220">Carvalho (2007),  p.220</ref><ref name="Schwarcz, p.463">Schwarcz, p.463</ref>  Very few were on hand to witness the departure.<ref>Schwarcz, p.465</ref> They were taken to the steamship ''Parna<U+00ED>ba'' and after that to the ship ''Alagoas'', in which they sailed the next day to Europe.<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.220"/><ref>Barman (1999), p.363</ref><ref>Lyra (v.3), p.117</ref> Before the final departure, Pedro II sent a short message to his faithful friend the Marquis of Tamandar<U+00E9>, who had remained at his side until embarkation: "What is done, is done. It remains to all of you to establish order and to consolidate your institutions."<ref>Besouchet, p.547</ref> After learning that the emperor had left, Benjamin Constant spoke: "It is fulfilled, the most painful of our duties."<ref>Besouchet, p.548</ref> Rui Barbosa later recalled saying to Major [[Carlos Nunes de Aguiar]], who had been at his side witnessing the departure from afar: "You were right to weep when the emperor left."<ref>Calmon (1975), p.1633</ref> It was "the end of the monarchy, but not of myth, called d. Pedro."<ref name="Schwarcz, p.463"/>

The government headed by Deodoro "was little more than a military dictatorship. The army dominated affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power."<ref>Munro, p.280</ref> The republican regime which followed the overthrow of the monarchy revealed itself to be highly unstable. In "a little more than a century of existence, the Brazilian Republic faced twelve [[state of emergency|states of emergency]], seventeen Institutional Acts, the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] dissolved six times, nineteen military revolutions, two presidential resignations, three presidents prevented from assuming office, four presidents deposed, seven different [[Constitution]]s, four [[dictatorship]]s, and nine authoritarian governments."<ref>Vasquez (2003), p.91</ref>
