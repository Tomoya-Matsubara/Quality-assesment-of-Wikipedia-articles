'''Federico Heraclio Cant<U+00FA> Garza''' (March 3, 1907 <U+2013> January 29, 1989) was a [[list of Mexican artists|Mexican painter, engraver and sculptor]].  While considered to be a member of the [[Mexican muralism]] movement, his style was noticeably different, mostly for adhering to older and more academic forms of painting and sculpture.  He has his most success exhibiting in the United States and Europe, but he did murals and sculptures in Mexico. His best known work is a sculpture called <U+201C>La maternidad<U+201D> which has been adapted as logo of the [[Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social]] (IMSS).

==Life==
Cant<U+00FA> was born to Mar<U+00ED>a Luiza Garza, a novelist and Adolfo Cant<U+00FA>, a journalist who opposed the [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]] regime. He was born shortly before the [[Mexican Revolution]] and spent his childhood split between [[Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]], with the family moving back permanently to Mexico in the 1920s.<ref name=flechador>{{cite news |author=Abraham Vazquez |title= Federico Cant<U+00FA>: El flechador solitario  |publisher= Palabra  |location=Saltillo  |language=Spanish |trans_title=Federico Cant<U+00FA>:The solitary archer |date=July 28, 2007 |page=7}}</ref><ref name=conarte>{{cite web |title= Federico Cant<U+00FA> |publisher= Pinacoteca de Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n  |location= Monterrey |language=Spanish |url=http://www.conarte.org.mx/PINACOTECA/10-FEDERICOCANT%DA.html |accessdate=July 12, 2013 }}</ref> He was born on March 3, 1907 in [[Monterrey]], but later in life, he changed his birth year to 1908 and his birthplace to [[Cadereyta Jim<U+00E9>nez]], where he family was originally from.<ref name=flechador/><ref name=retratos>{{cite news |author=Abraham Vazquez |title= Exhibir<U+00E1> Linares retratos de Federico Cant<U+00FA>  |publisher= El Norte  |location= Monterrey  |language=Spanish |trans_title=Will exhibit in Linares portraits of Federico Cantu |date=February 15, 2003 |page=7}}</ref><ref name=bancomer>{{cite book |title=Reperatory of Artists in Mexico:Plastic and Decorative Artes |volume=I |publisher=Fundaci<U+00F3>n Cultural Bancomer |location=Mexico City |year=1995 |isbn=968 6258 54 X |page=202 }}</ref>

From 1924 to 1934, he traveled and lived in Europe and the United States.<ref name=bancomer/> He first went to live in Paris on Rue Delambre in [[Montparnasse]], being only sixteen years old.

==Career==
Cant<U+00FA><U+2019>s career extended over 65 years and included exhibitions, monumental works, design, illustrations and more.<ref name=portalf/> From 1924 to 1931 he exhibited his work in the United States and Europe, with his first exhibition occurring at the [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]] .<ref name=conarte/><ref name=blaisten>{{cite web |title= Federico Cant<U+00FA> , 1907-1989 |publisher= Museo Blaisten  |location= Mexico City  |url=http://www.museoblaisten.com/v2008/indexENG.asp?myURL=salaFondoEng&AutoNum=94&ColectionID=3&RoomId=2&SubRoomId=11&SubSubRoomId=1 |accessdate=July 12, 2013 }}</ref> His first exhibition in Mexico was in 1933 at the Sal<U+00F3>n de Arte of the [[Secretar<U+00ED>a de Educaci<U+00F3>n P<U+00FA>blica]]. While living in New York, he took part in several collective shows.<ref name=flechador/><ref name=bancomer/> He had much of his success in these two places, with other shows at Tate Gallery in London, the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the Macy<U+2019>s Gallery and the Perls Gallery in New York.<ref name=bancomer/>

He did monumental works such as murals and sculptures, with one of the first a mural with [[Roberto Montenegro]] in 1934.<ref name=portalf/> These works can be found at universities, government buildings and private homes.<ref name=amrodriguez/> From 1951 to the early 1960s, he devoted most of his time painting murals in private homes, with a number of these since acquired by the government of Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n.<ref name=conarte/><ref name=bancomer/>   In the 1950s, he created a mural at the headquarters of the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social in Mexico City called <U+201C>Las Ense<U+00F1>anzas de Quetzalcoatl<U+201D> and another called <U+201C>Maternidad Yacente.<U+201D> The first was damage by the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], repaired by his son, Cantu Fabila and his wife Elsa. In 1958 he sculpted two stone slabs for the exterior of the Unidad Independencia theater in Mexico City. However, the day after they were finished, they were robbed. A similar fate happened to one of the copies of the IMSS emblem.<ref name=trabajos/> He created a low relief called El Flechador del sol in 1961 on the Sierra Madre along the highway between [[Linares, Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n|Linares]] and [[Galeana, Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n|Galeana]] in the municipality of [[Iturbide, Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]]. However, this work crumbled in 2002, with recovered pieces now on display at a site museum.<ref name=conarte/><ref name=trabajos/>   His last monument was designed in 1988, and dedicated to Alfonso Reyes.<ref name=bancomer/> One notable mural is Los informantes de Sahag<U+00FA>n at the former monastery of San Diego, which was the site of the Pinacoteca Virreinal in Mexico City. He also created a mural dedicated to Greek myth at the Philosophy and Letters department of the [[Universidad Aut<U+00F3>noma de Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]] .<ref name=conarte/> He also created murals for a church in [[San Miguel Allende]] but they were defaced due to a dispute between the artist the institution over how the characters were portrayed.<ref name=flechador/><ref name=trabajos/>

One of the murals he did in a private home was that of Benito Coquet, a public official. When he became head of IMSS in 1958, he hired Cant<U+00FA> to sculptures and designs for the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social.<ref name=bancomer/><ref name=3museos>{{cite web |title= M<U+00E9>xico Virreinal |publisher= Museo de Historia Mexicana/Museo del Noreste/Museo del Palacio |location= Monterrey |language=Spanish |trans_title= Colonial Mexico |url=http://www.3museos.com/themes/coleccion/mv_03.html |accessdate=July 12, 2013 }}</ref> His best known sculpture from this relationship is <U+201C>La maternidad<U+201D> which is used as the symbol of IMSS.<ref name=amrodriguez/> The emblem is also known as <U+201C>Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Seguro Social<U+201D> (Our Lady of Social Security) .<ref name=conarte/>

In addition to canvas works and monumental pieces, Cant<U+00FA> worked on a number of other projects. In 1945, he began working with [[Carlos Alvarado Lang]], creating [[burin]] engraving and dry point.<ref name=bancomer/><ref name=amrodriguez/> He illustrated poems done by writer friends such as [[Renato Leduc]], [[Luis Cardoza y Arag<U+00F3>n]], [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Al<U+00ED> Chumacero]] .<ref name=portalf/>  His first monograph work and book was <U+201C>A Matter of Love<U+201D> by [[Mackinley Helm]], which Cant<U+00FA> illustrated were both published in 1946.<ref name=bancomer/> In addition to the work he did for IMSS, other important sculptures include  Las ense<U+00F1>anzas de Quetzalc<U+00F3>atl and Las ense<U+00F1>anzas de cura Hidalgo.<ref name=amrodriguez/> However, a significant number of his works have been lost for various reasons, especially those done in Europe.<ref name=trabajos/>

In addition, Cant<U+00FA> taught both in Mexico and the United States. In the 1940s, he was an instructor at the [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"]] in the 1940s.<ref name=conarte/> in in 1951 he was a guest lecturer at the [[University of California]] .<ref name=bancomer/>

His work can be found at the Universidad Aut<U+00F3>noma de Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n, the Basilica de la Purisima in Mexico City, the former monastery of San Diego, the Pinacoteca Virreinal, the Charles Morgan Gallery in New York and Vatican City.<ref name=flechador/> He has been featured in a number of monographic publications and his work has been covered in books such as Cien a<U+00F1>os a trav<U+00E9>s de cien artistas of the [[Museo de Arte Contempor<U+00E1>neo de Monterrey]] (2000) and Arte Nuestro of the Museo Metropolitano de Monterrey (2005) .<ref name=conarte/> While alive, he had a retrospective at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in 1970,<ref name=conarte/> and one of the few to receive homage at the same institution while alive in 1986.<ref name=flechador/><ref name=blaisten/>

After his death his work is still sold and exhibited. In 2005, his painting <U+201C>Mujer Desnuda<U+201D> sold for 19,000 USD at [[Sotheby<U+2019>s]] .<ref name=flechador/> In 2007, the [[Universidad Aut<U+00F3>noma del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico]] held a large exhibition of his work for the 100th anniversary of his birth.<ref name=flechador/><ref name=amrodriguez/>

==Artistry==
Cant<U+00FA> created [[watercolor]]s, oils, drawings, inks, prints, [[monotype]]s, sculptures and murals.<ref name=bancomer/><ref name=amrodriguez/> He was admired for the quality of his drawings, which incorporated the people and landscapes of Mexico into his historical and religious works.<ref name=bancomer/>

In Europe, he was exposed to the avant garde movements of the time and in Mexico, the dominant form of Mexican muralism. However, Cant<U+00FA><U+2019>s style was classical and academic, often combining Classic myth with modern symbolism.<ref name=bancomer/><ref name=3museos/> This was true even of his mural work and was the only major painter at the time doing religious themes.<ref name=bancomer/><ref name=blaisten/> This put him at the margins of his Mexican muralist contemporaries.<ref name=portalf/> His dissatisfaction with this situation was expressed by him <U+201C>Is it fair to discount me as a Mexican, just because my paints do not drip [[Mole (sauce)|mole]] or sweat [[pulque]]?<U+201D><ref name=bancomer/> However, he has come to be known as <U+201C>El gran olvidado<U+201D> (the great forgotten one) .<ref name=flechador/><ref name=amrodriguez/>

He was an avid reader, with literature being a major influence on his work. He was especially fond of 15th-century French poet [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Villon]], but also read much of the work of Alfonso Reyes, Renato Leduc, [[Efra<U+00ED>n Huerta]], Jean Nicolas, [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Paul Val<U+00E9>ry]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Goethe]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Malraux]], and [[Paul <U+00C9>luard]] .<ref name=portalf/><ref name=amrodriguez/>
