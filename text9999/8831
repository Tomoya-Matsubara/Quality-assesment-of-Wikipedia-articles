'''''The Brownies' Book''''' was the first magazine published for [[African American]] children and youth.{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} Its creation was mentioned in the yearly children's issue of ''[[The Crisis]]'' in October 1919. The first issue was published during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in January 1920, with issues published monthly until December 1921.{{sfn|Capshaw Smith|2006|p=25}}{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} It is cited as an "important moment in literary history" for establishing black children's literature.{{sfn|Capshaw Smith|2006|p=25}}

The magazine was created by three people, all of whom were also involved with ''The Crisis'',{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} a magazine associated with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Its editor was [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], one of the founders of the NAACP, and its [[business manager]] was [[Augustus Granville Dill]].{{sfn|Lewis|2009|p=263-264}}{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} The magazine's literary editor was [[Jessie Redmon Fauset]].{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}}

Each year, ''The Crisis'' published an issue referred to as the "Children's Number", which included stories, photographs, games, poetry, and educational achievements of black children.{{sfn|Harris|1989|loc=From an excerpt of the article.}} These issues also contained more serious information, particularly political events and [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings in the United States]]; Du Bois covered lynchings and violent attacks on black Americans because he was concerned about the effects reports of these incidents would have on black children.{{sfn|Harris|1989|loc=From an excerpt of the article.}}

In the October 1919 "Children's Number" issue of ''The Crisis'', Du Bois wrote a column titled "The True Brownies"{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=96}} announcing the impending publication of ''The Brownies' Book'', stating the first issue would be released the following month. He also stated that it was "designed for all children, but especially for ours", with a target audience of children and youth between six and sixteen years old.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=92}} Dill and Du Bois established Du Bois and Dill Publishers in [[New York City]] to publish each issue of ''The Brownies' Book''.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=93}}

One of the goals of the magazine was to dispel the "grotesque stereotypes" of the "Dark Continent",{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} a disparaging term used for [[Africa]] and its people. Middle-class African American children "consumed this propaganda along with the white children who were its implied audience" in children's literary works such as the magazine ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]''.{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=95}} The 1919 article "The True Brownies"  included commentary by Du Bois discussing children, stating that "to seek to raise them in ignorance of their racial identity and peculiar situation is inadvisable<U+2014>impossible", in which the use of the phrase "peculiar situation" is an [[allusion]] to the euphemism "[[peculiar institution]]", meaning slavery.{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=95}} Du Bois believed children should be taught their racial identity and social situation.{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=95}} The name of the magazine is derived from the folkloric creatures [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]], who were said to complete household chores at night in exchange for food, alluding to African Americans being used as servants, but the term is used as [[Signifyin'|signification]] in the "oppressive literary-historical context".{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=96}} Specifically, the creators wanted to "make colored children realize that being 'colored' is a normal beautiful thing".{{sfn|Hutchinson|2009|p=128}}

Another goal was to expand the canon of black children's literature, in which fiction and fantasy were rare,{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=102}} and to encourage youth participation in the NAACP.{{sfn|The Crisis|2000|p=25}} It also intended to develop [[The Talented Tenth]], capable African Americans in the top [[decile]] who could become leaders in the black community.{{sfn|Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities}}

The seven goals stated in "The True Brownies" were:{{sfn|Du Bois|1919|p=286}}
{{Quotation|
*To make colored children realize that being "colored" is a normal, beautiful thing.
*To make them familiar with the history and achievements of the Negro race.
*To make them know that other colored children have grown into beautiful, useful and famous persons.
*To teach them a delicate code of honor and action in their relations with white children.
*To turn their little hurts and resentments into emulation, ambition and love of their homes and companions.
*To point out the best amusements and joys and worth-while things of life.
*To inspire them to prepare for definite occupations and duties with a broad spirit of sacrifice.

==Content and editing==
Each issue was published on good quality paper, the cover of each designed by prominent black artists.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=93}} Its format and layout was similar to that of ''The Crisis'', and it contained little advertising.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=93}} Illustrations and photographs complemented the varied content, which included poetry, literature, biographies of successful black people, music, games, plays, and current events.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=93}} Biographies included those for [[Phillis Wheatley]], the [[List of African-American firsts|first published African American woman]],{{sfn|Gates|2010}} [[Bert Williams]], a popular entertainer of the [[Vaudeville]] era, and [[Sojourner Truth]], an abolitionist and women's rights activist that had been born into slavery.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=94}} The advertising it did include promoted black children's literature not typically available in bookstores.{{sfn|Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities}} Each issue cost 15 cents, with a yearly subscription costing {{currency|1.50|USD}}.

Common elements in each issue were the column "As the Crow Flies", written by Du Bois to relate current events to the children, an advice column by Fauset titled "The Judge", a reader's letters section named "The Jury", and "Little People of the Month" featuring photographs and the artistic and academic achievements of children submitted by its readers.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=93}}{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} Content generated by Du Bois would exhibit his "opposition to the social philosophy" of [[Booker T. Washington]].{{sfn|Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities}} His articles for "As the Crow Flies" were usually at "a level incredibly sophisticated for a children's magazine".{{sfn|Wall|1995|p=54}} The inaugural issue contained a photo of African American children protesting violence against blacks by marching in the [[Silent Parade]] of 1917 in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}}<!-- it as on page 26; see

Fauset solicited submissions from many notable authors, particularly those in the Harlem Renaissance movement. Among notable authors to have material published in ''The Brownies' Book'' were [[Langston Hughes]], [[Nella Larsen]], [[Effie Lee Newsome]]{{sfn|Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities}} and [[Georgia Douglas Johnson]].{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} Some of the authors had read ''St. Nicholas'' as children, including Du Bois' daughter Yolande and Newsome.{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=95}}

Hughes submitted a letter to the editor and his high school graduation photograph to the magazine, which published it in one of its summer issues with those of other high school graduates.{{sfn|Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities}}{{sfn|Kommers Czarniecki|2004|p=196}} In 1921, ''The Brownies' Book'' became the first publication to publish his poetry, and it would publish more of his works in subsequent issues.{{sfn|Center for Digital Resources in the Humanities}} Fauset requested Hughes to write about life in Mexico because of its exotic appeal in the United States.{{sfn|Kernan|2007|p=106}} Larsen's first literary works were two articles about games she claimed she learned and played during her youth in [[Denmark]], published in ''The Brownies' Book'' with the byline attributing Nella Larsen Imes.{{sfn|Hostetler|2006|p=537}}{{sfn|Rayson|2004|p=515}}<!-- However, she never travelled outside the United States.{{sfn|Wall|1995|p=92}} -->

Although Fauset was the literary editor, she was also likely responsible for most of the managing editorial work, a role by which she was officially recognized in the second year of the magazine's publication.{{sfn|Kory|2001|p=100}} She also dealt with all correspondence, and wrote hundreds of the articles that appeared in the magazine.{{sfn|The Crisis|2000|p=25}} Fauset promoted the work of African American women authors and illustrators, for some of whom it launched their career.{{sfn|Wall|1995|p=54}}

==Legacy==
The periodical magazine has garnered more critical attention than any other black children's literature produced during the Harlem Renaissance.{{sfn|Capshaw Smith|2006|p=25}}

The Du Bois and Dill Publishers ceased operations after publication of ''The Brownies' Book'' was discontinued.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=93}} It's only other publication was the 1921 book ''Unsung Heroes'' by Elizabeth Ross Haynes.{{sfn|Joyce|1991|p=93}}<!-- not [[Elizabeth Haynes]] -->
