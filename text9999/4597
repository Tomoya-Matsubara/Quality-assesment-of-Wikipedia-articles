The Apple A5 is a [[package on package]] (PoP) [[system-on-a-chip]] (SoC) designed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and manufactured by [[Samsung]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4213981/Samsung-fabs-Apple-A5-processor |title= Updated: Samsung fabs Apple A5 processor | date= March 12, 2011 | publisher= EETimes.com| accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref> to replace the [[Apple A4]]. The chip commercially debuted with the release of Apple's [[iPad 2]] [[tablet computer|tablet]], followed by [[iPhone 4S]] [[smartphone]]. (This is consistent with how Apple debuted the A4 chip: first in the original iPad, then in the iPhone 4, and finally in the iPod touch 4th generation.<ref>[http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=3264638 iPhone 5 expected to have same A5 chip as iPad 2]</ref>)

The A5 contains a dual-core [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore|ARM Cortex-A9]] CPU<ref name="anandtech1">{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4215/apple-ipad-2-benchmarked-dualcore-cortex-a9-powervr-sgx-543mp2/2 |title=Apple iPad 2 Preview - AnandTech :: Your Source for Hardware Analysis and News |publisher=AnandTech |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref> with [[ARM]]'s advanced [[SIMD]] extension, marketed as [[ARM architecture#Advanced_SIMD_.28NEON.29|NEON]], and a dual core [[PowerVR|PowerVR SGX543MP2]] GPU. This GPU can push between 70 and 80 million polygons/second and has a pixel fill rate of 2 billion pixels/second.

==Apple A6==
TSMC is reportedly begun trial manufacturing of the Apple A6 on their 28 nm fabrication process. It is debated whether TSMC will be the only supplier of the A6 chip that is speculated will be the heart of the iPad 3, rumored to be released in the first half of 2012<ref>[http://www.ipodnn.com/articles/11/09/08/supplier.prepping.for.28nm.chip.production/ TSMC may be ready to build A6 chipsets in early 2012]</ref>, since it's also reported that Apple will stick to Samsung as primary supplier due to fabrication problems at TSMC.<ref>[http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/17/apple-to-stick-with-samsung-for-a6-chip-production-after-all/ Apple to Stick with Samsung for A6 Chip Production After All?]</ref>

Other specifications are unknown though rumors include an increased core count to quad-core, enhanced GPU<ref>[http://www.gottabemobile.com/2011/06/16/next-gen-apple-a6-arm-processor-to-use-powervr-series-6-rogue-gpu/#utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Gottabemobile+%28GottaBeMobile%29 Next-Gen Apple A6 ARM Processor to Use PowerVR Series 6 <U+2018>Rogue<U+2019> GPU?]</ref> or an increase in clock speed.
