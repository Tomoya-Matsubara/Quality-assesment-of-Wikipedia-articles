'''Mobile apps''', also called '''mobile applications''', are [[software applications]], usually designed to run on [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s.  They are available through application distribution platforms which are typically operated by the owner of the [[mobile operating system]], such as the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], [[Android Market]], and [[BlackBerry App World]].  Some apps are free, and others have a price.  Usually they are downloaded from the platform to a target device such as an [[iPhone]], [[BlackBerry]], or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone, but sometimes they can be downloaded to less mobile computers such as a [[laptop]]s or [[desktop computer|desktops]]. For apps with a price, generally a percentage, 20-30%, goes to the distribution provider (such as [[iTunes]]), and the rest goes to the producer of the app.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/11/analyst-theres-a-great-future-in-iphone-apps/ |title=Analyst: There<U+2019>s a great future in iPhone apps |last=Siegler |first=MG |work=Venture Beat |date=June 11, 2008}}</ref>

The term "app" has become a buzzword in popular culture, and in 2010 was listed as "Word of the Year" by the [[American Dialect Society]].

Mobile apps were originally intended for productivity: email, [[electronic calendar|calendar]] and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as [[mobile games]], factory automation, [[GPS]] and [[location-based services]], order-tracking, and ticket purchases.
