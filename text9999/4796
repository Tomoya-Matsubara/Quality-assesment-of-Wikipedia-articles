The '''Kaufman Electrification Act of 1923''', enacted by the [[New York State Assembly]], mandated [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] of all [[Transportation_in_New_York_City#Railroads|railroads in New York City]] by January 1, 1926. The bill was sponsored by recently elected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Assemblyman Victor R. Kaufman and signed by Governor [[Al Smith]] on June 2, 1923.<ref name=JUNE5>''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50611F83C5416738DDDAC0894DE405B838EF1D3 Ponder New Law]''.

The city of [[Baltimore]] enacted a similar law, ''Ordinance 746<U+2013>748'', in June 1929.<ref name=U26/>

==Background==

[[File:1918 NYCRR Manhattan crop 27-43rd Streets West.jpg|thumb|right|Freight yards and tracks of the West Side (27th to 43rd Streets).]]

In 1846 the City of New York allowed the [[New York Central Railroad#The Hudson River Railroad|Hudson River Railroad Company]] to lay the tracks for [[West Side Line (NYCRR)|its new line]] to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] directly on the streets, "westerly of and including the [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|8th Avenue]] and [[Hudson Street, Manhattan|Hudson Street]].<ref name=A82>''Annual Report 1930'', p. 82.</ref> For more than seventy years steam trains ran directly on major streets and avenues of New York.<ref name=A82/> The elevated [[rapid transit]] lines on the Manhattan were converted from steam to [[third rail]] electrical traction in 1900<U+2013>1903,<ref>Cudahy, p. 16.</ref> the passenger [[trunk line]]s were gradually electrified over the next decades.

On January 8, 1902 fifteen commuters from [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] were killed when a local train from [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] missed a red light and rear-ended a train stopped in [[Park Avenue Tunnel (railroad)|Park Avenue Tunnel]].<ref name=D19>Douglas et al., p. 19.</ref> The accident was linked to exhaust smoke obstructing view of traffic signals. The resulting public outcry led to calls for electrification of the line and replacement of the then-overcrowded Grand Central Depot. In 1903 state legislators passed a law banning steam locomotives from [[Manhattan]] after June 30, 1908 and demanding electrification of [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYCRR).<ref name=C17>Cudahy, p. 17.</ref> The company, which had already contemplated electrification, introduced electric traction on its Manhattan trunk lines in the end of 1906.<ref name=C17/> The NYCRR mainline employed [[third rail]] electric supply because low clearance in the tunnels ruled out use of [[overhead lines]].<ref name=D19/> The trains changed electric locomotives for steam engines at [[Croton-Harmon (Metro-North station)|Croton-Harmon]] and [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]].<ref name=D19/> Other incoming trunk lines were largely electrified by 1923.<ref name=S35>Solomon, p. 35.</ref> The isolated [[Staten Island Railway]], operated by [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], remained powered by outdated coal-fired [[4-4-0]] [[Camelback locomotive|camelbacks]] and [[2-2-4]]'s hauling wooden cars.<ref name=HW131>Harwood and Wilson, p. 131.</ref>

However, freight and switching operation remained powered by coal-firing steam engines, contributing to [[air pollution]] and road accidents. The NYCRR was the only railroad with north-south tracks connecting [[Manhattan]] to [[upstate New York]]; the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] operated an [[Northeast Corridor|east-west passenger service]] through the [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in [[midtown Manhattan]]. All other mainline railroads terminated along the [[New Jersey]] and [[Brooklyn]] shorelines and ferried their railcars to Manhattan by [[car float]]s. They operated dozens of big and small rail yards on Manhattan and employed scores of coal-fired switchers. The worst offender were the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] freight yards below the 33rd Street, where coal-firing [[switcher]]s hauled their cargoes along the [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|11th Avenue]], popularly called the "Death Avenue",<ref>''[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40D12F63C5D15738DDDAB0994D9415B838EF1D3 Central Asks New 11th Av.

The New York Times, November 12, 1923.</ref> and adjacent streets.<ref name=S35/><ref>Site of present-day [[West Side Yard]] and [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project]].</ref> The government handled safety and pollution problems separately: ordinances to eliminate [[grade crossing]]s were effected on a case-by-case basis, complete elimination of steam traction became the target of the 1923 bill introduced by Victor R. Kaufman.

==Politics==

The 1923 Kaufman Act was enacted in the shadows of a far larger public debate about the future of the troubled [[New York City Subway]]. The [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company]] was placed under [[receivership]] in December 1918 and was heading into liquidation.<ref name=C80>Cudahy, p. 80.</ref> The [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] barely escaped bankruptcy in 1921.<ref name=C81>Cudahy, p. 81.</ref> Post-war [[inflation]] devalued the five-cent ticket price fixed in the [[Dual Contracts]] of 1913, and the companies defaulted on their investment contracts.<ref name=C81/> They lobbied to raise ticket price and were stonewalled by New York City mayor, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Francis Hylan]], who made cheap fares a major campaign issue,<ref>DuTemple, p. 56.</ref><ref>His 1921 campaign motto was "Preservation of democracy and the retention of five-cent fare" - DuTemple, p. 59. Five-cent fare was effective from 1904 to 1948 - well past Hylan's term - DuTemple, p. 68.</ref> denied public help to BMT and IRT,<ref>DuTemple, p.59.</ref> and demanded public control over the subway.<ref name=C82>Cudahy, p. 82.</ref> Hylan, determined to [[nationalization|nationalize]] the subway, ran into an open conflict with the moderately minded Transit Commission, which was created by Republican Governor [[Nathan Lewis Miller]] in 1921.<ref name=C83>Cudahy, p. 83.</ref> The new governor [[Al Smith]], elected in [[New York state election, 1922|November 1922]], sided with Hylan on the transit issue, but failed to disband the Commission due to Republican opposition in the State Assembly.<ref>Cudahy, pp. 83-84.</ref> 

In August 1922 Hylan stirred up the public by announcing the plan to effect forced buy-back provision of the Dual Contracts, which would effectively start nationalization, and a $600 million plan for building an all-new, public transit system <U+2013> the future [[Independent Subway System]].<ref name=C86>Cudahy, p. 86.</ref> The heated discussion that followed coincided with the State Assembly election campaign. Elections of November 1922 brought majority in the Assembly to the Republicans, but in the Senate the Democrats with a very thin edge over the Republicans, although only for one year.<ref name=Jan7/><ref name=Nov5>''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0617F63B5F17738DDDAC0894D9415B848EF1D3 Legislature Again Solidly Republican]''. The New York Times, November 5, 1924.</ref>

One of the Republican Assemblymen elected from New York City was Victor R. Kaufman, of the Seventh electoral district<ref name=Jan7>''New Legislators Hold Conference''. The New York Times, January 7, 1923.</ref> of Manhattan's West Side.<ref name=Mar20/><ref>Complete election roster: ''[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A05E5D61139E133A25756C0A9679D946395D6CF Aspirants Seeking Office Next Tuesday]''. The New York Times, November 5, 1922.</ref> The "boyish-looking" Kaufman was one of the five Republicans who voted against Hylan's popular Traction Bill.<ref name=Apr14>''Hylan Yells Drown Opponent's Speech''. The New York Times, April 14, 1923.</ref> In April 1923 he dared to oppose Hylan in a face-to-face public debate in front of pro-Hylan audience.<ref name=Apr14/> The two discussed subway congestion, public busing and court system, and Hylan easily held his ground; he left with a patronizing remark: "Don't be too harsh with the Assemblyman... he is young yet".<ref name=Apr14/>

==Enactment and reaction==

The debate on the 65th Street occurred just a week after the State Assembly committee issued a go-ahead for Kaufman's electrification bill. Kaufman's proposal had not yet aroused public interest; on April 7 the [[New York Times]] barely mentioned as a local ordinance limited to the freight yards along [[Riverside Drive]].<ref name=Apr7>''May Bar Steam Traffic''. The New York Times, April 7, 1923.</ref> Hylan stayed aside from the electrification debate and the bill passed the Assembly vote without much debate. The Act required that by January 1, 1926 all railroad traffic in New York City, [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] and [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]<ref name=M27/> must be converted to electrical traction (which, at the moment, was the only viable alternative to steam). There were no exclusions, and it applied equally to trunk lines, second-tier country lines and even the [[switcher]]s in the docks and freight yards. The [[exclave]] system of [[Staten Island]] was not excluded either.<ref name=HW131/> Each failure to comply was subject to a $5,000 fine per violation per day.<ref name=M27/>

After the vote, but before signing by the Governor, railroads launched a public and political campaign to block the bill.<ref name=Jun1/> On the eve of the deadline for signing, representatives of the B & O Railroad, New York Central, New Haven & Hartford and Long Island railroads convened in Albany for a last-minute meeting with Al Smith.<ref name=Jun1/> They cited insurmountable costs of conversion (30 million dollars for the LIRR) and the dangers of electrifying urban at-grade railroads.<ref name=Jun1>''Rail Men Fight Bill to Electrify Roads''. The New York Times, June 2, 1923.</ref> Kaufman brought his own party of civic activists and businessmen and prevailed: Smith signed the bill on the next day, Saturday, June 2, 1923.<ref>''Ponder New Law''. The New York Times, June 7, 1923.</ref>

The 1923 act did not attempt to redesign the existing track or decrease at-grade railroad traffic. Kaufman addressed this issue in his 1924 "Death Avenue Bill" that attempted to regulate the NYCRR West Side network.<ref name=Mar20>''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B13FB355812738DDDA90A94DB405B848EF1D3 Death Avenue Bill Would Force Action]''. The New York Times, March 20, 1924.</ref> The bill did not pass, and debate over West Side trackage continued into late 1920s.

==Dieselisation==

In March 1924 [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] began electrification and elimination of grade crossings of its Staten Island lines, for an estimated cost of 13 to 15 millions (not including freight lines).<ref>''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60613F9355812738DDDAE0A94DB405B848EF1D3 B.&O.

The New York Times, November 8, 1929.</ref> The [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] purchased two similar switchers and put one in operation at their 132nd Street ''[[Harlem Transfer]]'' yard as Harlem Transfer #2 <ref name=S36/> and the other locomotive as #3001, which was assigned to their 25th Street Freight Station in Brooklyn. Erie Railroad also purchased two 60 ton 300 hp box cabs: #20 which was built in May 1926 and sent to their "Harlem Station" freight terminal, and #19 which was built in September 1928 and operated at their "West 26th Street Freight Station" in Manhattan. Successful introduction of diesel traction led to the 1926 amendment of the 1923 law that allowed operation of diesel locomotives in the city.

The [[Long Island Railroad]] authorized a 4 million conversion plan in April 1924.<ref>''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C11F6355812738DDDAD0894DC405B848EF1D3 Long Island R.R.

==New York Central and the city==

The NYCRR, on the contrary, had posted record profits for 1923.<ref name=May28>''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B12FC385F17738DDDA10A94DD405B848EF1D3 New York Central has Greater Year]''.

[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]. September 10, 1926.</ref> The State Assembly amended the Act to comply with the concerns raised in the ruling, extended penalty deadline for another five years, and allowed use of diesel locomotives along with electric ones.

On July 1, 1926, when the lawsuit was still in progress, Hylan convened a conference of city and railroad executives. It resulted in a general agreement to remove surface tracks from West Side altogether.<ref name=A82/> The Engineering Committee appointed at this conference presented their detailed plan in May 1927<ref name=A82/> and secured an approval of the State Assembly in 1928.<ref name=A83>''Annual Report 1930'', p. 83.</ref> In July 1929 the NYCRR finally agreed to cease steam traffic north of the 72nd Street in two years time, and remove all tracks south of the 60th Street, in five years.<ref name=A83/> The 30th Street freight yards were allowed to stay.<ref name=A83/> The project resulted in the all-new, {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[High Line (New York City)|High Line]] that cost $150 million and opened up in 1934.
