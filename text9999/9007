'''Hinduism''' {[[Sanskrit]]/[[Hindi]] - '''''Hind<U+016B> Dharma''''', also known as '''San<U+0101>tana''' ''(eternal)'' '''Dharma''', and '''Vaidika''' ''(of the Vedas)'' '''Dharma'''} is the oldest [[religion]] from the [[Indian subcontinent]], based on the [[Veda]]s and the beliefs of other people of India. It is the oldest religion still practiced today. The term ''Hinduism'' is heterogenous, as Hinduism consists of several schools of thought. It encompasses many religious rituals that widely vary in practice, as well as many diverse sects and philosophies. [[Hindu]]s venerate an array of deities, or consider them as manifestations of the one Supreme [[monistic]] Cosmic Spirit ''[[Brahman]]'', while many others focus on a singular concept of God, such as in [[Vaishnavism]], [[Saivism]] and [[Shaktism]].<ref> [http://www.atributetohinduism.com/introduction_to_hinduism.htm]</ref>

Hinduism is the [[Major world religions|third largest religion]] in the world with approximately 970 million adherents ([[2005]] figure), approximately 900 million of whom live in [[India]].<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555715/Hinduism.html]</ref> <ref>[http://www.haryana-online.com/Culture/hinduism.htm]</ref>

== Etymology ==
The term '''[[Hindu]]''' is derived from ''[[Sindhu]]'' ({{lang|sa|<U+0938><U+093F><U+0928><U+094D><U+0927><U+0941>}}, i.e. the [[Indus River]], in particluar, or any river in general). In [[Rigveda]], the Indo-Aryans mention their land as ''Sapta Sindhu'' (the land of the seven rivers of the north-western [[Indian subcontinent]], one of them being the Indus). This corresponds to ''hapta-hendu'' in the ''[[Avesta]]'' (''Vendidad: Fargard'' 1.18). The term was used for people who lived in the Indian sub-continent around or beyond the ''Sindhu''. 

The Persian term was borrowed by the Ancient Greeks as ''Indos'', ''Indikos'' "Indian", from which was derived the name ''India'', ''Indianus'' in Latin. The term ''hindu'' was also loaned into [[Sanskrit]], as ''{{IAST|hindu}}'' ({{lang|sa|<U+0939><U+093F><U+0928><U+094D><U+0926><U+0941>}}), appearing in some early-[[medieval]] texts (e.g. ''{{IAST|Bhavi<U+1E63>ya Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a, K<U+0101>lik<U+0101> Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a, R<U+0101>mako<U+015B>a, Hemantakaviko<U+015B>a}}'' and ''{{IAST|Adbhutar<U+016B>pako<U+015B>a}}'').

According to [[Historical linguistics]], [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] / *s / is  preserved in the  [[Indo-Aryan languages]] (including [[Sanskrit]] as / s /) but was changed to / h / in prevocalic position in the [[Iranian languages|Iranian branch]] (including [[Avestan]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]);  see also [[Indo-European sound laws]].

== Core concepts == 
The Hindu faiths, practices and philosophies have evolved from the Vedic tradition (''Vaidika parampar{{Unicode|<U+0101>}}'') and from the beliefs of the other Indian peoples. [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], share common philosophical and spiritual traits in varying degrees with Hinduism.  Many Hindus would argue that while the aforementioned philosophies have gained recognition as independent world religions, the great diversity within Hinduism itself is even greater and therefore it is best to refer to all Indic religions under one umbrella.

===The Eternal Way ===
''{{IAST|San<U+0101>tana Dharma}}''<U+2014>"The Eternal [[Dharma]] (Ethos, Law, Values)"<U+2014>the traditional name of Hinduism, alludes to the idea that certain spiritual principles hold true forever, transcending man-made constructs, representing a pure science of consciousness. This consciousness is not merely that of the body or mind and intellect, but of a transcendental state that exists within and beyond our somatic existence, the unsullied '[[Soul]]' of all. Religion to the Hindu is the eternal search for the divine ''[[Brahman]]'' (wordstem: {{lang|sa|}} / {{IPA|br<U+0259>hm<U+0259>n}} /; nominative singular: ''{{IAST|brahma}}'' {{lang|sa|}} / {{IPA|br<U+0259>hm<U+0259>}} /), translated as the "Supreme Immanent and Transcendent Truth" or the '''Cosmic Spirit'''.
 
Hinduism has a deserved reputation of being highly tolerant of other religions. As expressed in the ''Rig Veda'' verse:
:{{lang|sa|}}
:''{{Unicode|ekam sat vipr<U+0101> bahudh<U+0101> vadanti}}''
:Truth is One, but sages call it by many names
:<small>Rig Veda 1:164:46</small></blockquote>. 

Hinduism's aspiration is best expressed in the following ''[[mantra]]'' from the ''[[Brihadaranyaka|{{Unicode|B<U+1E5B>had<U+0101>ra<U+1E47>yaka}}]] [[Upanishad]]'':{{lang|sa|}}<ref><small>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1:3:28</small></ref>
:{{Unicode|'''OM''' ''Asato m<U+0101> sadgamaya, tamaso m<U+0101> jyotirgamaya, mrityorm<U+0101>mritam gamaya''}}
:''OM (Lead me) from falsehood to truth, from darkness to light, from death to immortality.''

=== Basic beliefs ===
[[Image:Naradiyamahapuranam.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[N<U+0101>radeya Purana|Atha Naradiyamahapuranam]]'' describes the mechanics of the cosmos. Depicted here are [[Vishnu]] the Maintainer with his consort [[Lakshmi]] resting on [[Shesha|Shesha Nag]]. The great sage [[Narada]] and [[Brahma]] the [[Creator]] are also pictured.]]Themes common to the value system of Hindus is the belief in ''[[Dharma]]'' (individual ethics, duties and obligations), ''[[Samsara|{{Unicode|Sams<U+0101>ra}}]]'' ([[Reincarnation]]/rebirth), ''[[Karma]]'' ("actions", leading to a cause and effect relationship), and ''[[Moksha|{{Unicode|Moksha}}]]'' (salvation) of every soul through a variety of paths, such as ''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotion), ''[[Karma]]'' (selfless action) and ''[[Jnana|{{Unicode|J<U+00F1><U+0101>na}}]]'' (enlightenment, knowledge), and of course, belief in God ([[Ishvara|''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}]]''). ''Reincarnation'' or the soul's transmigration through a cycle of birth and death, until it attains {{Unicode|Mok<U+1E63>ha}}, is governed by ''[[Karma]]''. The philosophy of ''Karma'' lays forth the results of free-willed actions, which leave their imprint on the [[soul]] or the self, called as ''[[Atman (Buddhism)|{{IAST|<U+0101>tman}}]]''. These actions determine the course of life and the life cycle for the soul in its subsequent life. Virtuous actions take the soul closer to the Supreme Divine, and lead to a birth with higher consciousness. Evil actions hinder this recognition of the Supreme Divine, and the soul takes lower forms of worldly life. All existence, according to Hinduism, from vegetation to mankind, are subjects to the eternal ''Dharma'', which is the natural law. Even [[Heaven]] (''[[swarga|Svarga Loka]]'') and [[Hell]] (''[[Naraka|Naraka Loka]]'') are temporary. Liberation from this material existence and cycle of birth and death, to join, reach or develop a relationship with the "universal spirit" (depending on belief), is known as ''{{Unicode|Mok<U+1E63>ha}}'', which is the ultimate goal of all Hindus. 

The other principles include the ''[[Guru-shishya tradition]]'', the divinity of the word [[Aum|OM]], the power of ''[[mantra]]s'' and manifestations of the Divine's spirit in all forms of existence ([[pantheism]]). According to Hinduism, the essential spark of the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]/[[Brahman]]'' is in every living being, the concept that all living beings are divine. Another belief is that though Hindu [[mythology]] mentions a class of evil beings (demons, called ''Asuras'' or ''{{Unicode|R<U+0101>k<U+1E63>hasas}}''), opposed to the celestial spirits (''Devas''), essential Hindu philosophy does not believe in any concept of a central [[Devil]] or [[Satan]]. This does not mean that all the evil in the world is attributed to God, but that the evil (deed or thought) is ascribed to human ignorance. Hinduism does not [[evangelization|evangelize]] as do [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Since the Hindu scriptures are essentially silent on the issue of [[religious conversion]], the issue is open to interpretations. <ref name=conversion>[http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/hbh/hbh_ch-5.html "Does Hinduism Accept Newcomers?"] </ref>

=== Nature of God ===
The Vedas depict ''[[Brahman]]'' as the Ultimate Reality, the Absolute or Universal Soul (''[[Paramatman|{{Unicode|Param<U+0101>tman}}]]'') <ref name=ultimatereality>[http://www.reflectionsindia.org/reality.pdf "Reality-Shift..."]. Page 3</ref>.  It is the ultimate principle who is without a beginning, without an end, who is hidden in all and who is the cause, source, material and effect of all creation known, unknown and yet to happen in the entire universe. ''Brahman'' (not to be confused with the deity ''[[Brahma|{{Unicode|Brahm<U+0101>}}]]'') is seen as the unique [[panentheism|panentheistic]] '''Cosmic Spirit'''. ''Brahman'' may be viewed as bereft of  personal attributes &mdash; ''[[Nirguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Nirgu<U+1E47>a Brahman}}]]'' (except the qualities of infinite truth, infinite consciousness and infinite bliss), or with auspicious manifestable  attributes &mdash; ''[[Saguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Sagu<U+1E47>a Brahman}}]]''. The former view is called ''Parabrahman'' and the latter view is called ''Aparabrahman''.

Perhaps the best word in Hinduism to represent the concept of ''God'' is ''[[Ishvara|{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}]]'' (literally, the ''Supreme Lord'') <ref name=ishvara>Swami Krishnananda. [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_72.pdf "The Doctrine of the Upanishads"]. Page 7</ref>. In ''[[Advaita Vedanta|{{Unicode|Advaita Ved<U+0101>nta}}]]'' philosophy, ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'' is simply the manifested form of Brahman upon human mind. According to ''[[Smarta|{{Unicode|Sm<U+0101>rta}}]]'' views, the Supreme Being can be with attributes, ''[[Saguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Sagu<U+1E47>a Brahman}}]]'', and also be viewed with whatever attributes, (e.g., a [[goddess]]) a devotee conceives <ref name=saguna>Eaton, James. [http://www.stanford.edu/group/dualist/vol5/pdfs/eaton.pdf "Desmond's Fourfold Sense of Being.."]. Page 2</ref>. For the Hindus, ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'', who is one and only one, is full of innumerable auspicious qualities; He is omniscient, omnipotent, perfect, just, merciful, glorious, mysterious, and yet full of love. He is the Creator, the Ruler and the Destroyer of this universe. Some believe Him to be infinite and incorporeal. In Vaishnavism and Shaivism, ''[[Saguna Brahman|{{Unicode|Sagu<U+1E47>a Brahman}}]]'' is viewed solely as ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}]]'' or ''[[Shiva]]''<U+2014>so their followers may attribute an anthropomorphic form to ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}''. He is also called as ''[[Bhagavan|{{Unicode|Bhagav<U+0101>n}}]]'' in modern Hindi.  Note that gender is not a distinguishing attribute: ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'' is neither male nor female, neither "with gender" nor "without" (although ''grammatically'' masculine). ''Brahman'' is grammatically neuter.

===The many deities===
[[Image:UniversalForm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Krishna]] revealing his universal form to [[Arjuna]] in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' <small>''Artwork <U+00A9> courtesy of [http://www.krishna.com The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]''</small>]]
The Hindu religion also believes in many celestial entities which are called ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]''. These ''Devas'' may variously be translated into English as gods, or as demigods, deities, celestial spirits or angels, none of which is an exact translation. The feminine of ''deva'' is '''''{{Unicode|dev<U+012B>}}'''''. It is the worship of the ''devas'' that gives the impression that Hinduism is [[polytheism|polytheistic]]. However, the terms ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'' and ''devas'' must not be confused. ''Devas'' could be as numerous as 330 million.<ref name=numberofdevas> [http://www.indhistory.com/hindu-god.html "Hindu God and Goddess"]</ref> But, it is incorrect to say that Hinduism has 330 million ''Gods'', which are more correctly ''[[deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'' or celestial beings. 
#According to the philosophy of ''[[Advaita Vedanta|{{Unicode|Advaita Ved<U+0101>nta}}]]'', and many verses of ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{Unicode|Bhagavad G<U+012B>t<U+0101>}}]]'', the ''{{Unicode|Upani<U+1E63>hads}}'' and the ''Vedas'', all the ''devas'' are simply the more mundane manifestations of the Supreme Lord ([[Ishvara|''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}]]'') in the human mind, and hence, ultimately, the different manifestations of the One ''Brahman'' that the human mind conceives.<ref name=bhadvadgita>Arnold, Sir Edwin. [http://student.science.uva.nl/~kmaheshw/Files/bhagavadGita.pdf "The Bhagvad Gita"]. Chapter 7 (Page 30)</ref>. In order to worship the formless ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'', the devotee conceives an anthropomorphic form of God in his mind for the sake of worshipping Him with love and {{Unicode|[[Bhakti]]}}.
#According to the philosophies of ''[[Nyaya|{{Unicode|Ny<U+0101>ya}}]]'', ''[[Vaisheshika|{{Unicode|Vaishe<U+1E63>hika}}]]'', ''[[Yoga]]'', verses from the ''Shrutis'' and certain Shaivite and Vaishnavite thoughts, the ''devas'' are those immortal celestial beings who are subservient to the Supreme Lord ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'', but are above human beings. Thus, they are the divine powers who preside over the forces of nature and act as a link between God and the mortal world. They all derive their power from God, under whose control they always work.
# According to the philosophy of ''[[Mimamsa|{{Unicode|M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>s<U+0101>}}]]'', all the ''devas'' and ''{{Unicode|dev<U+012B>s}}'' are the sovereign rulers of the forces of nature and there is no one Supreme ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'' as their Lord. To do a desired action, the humans must please each or several of these ''devas'' by worshipping them with proper rituals. This kind of view could be regarded as purely [[polytheism|polytheistic]]. Although the later ''{{Unicode|M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>sak<U+0101>s}}'' retracted this view and accepted ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'', this view is still held today by a substantial populace of today's Hindus.

More precisely, the Hindu scriptures and most Shaivite and Vaishnavite thoughts regard the ''devas'' as a combination of the first two views; e.g., ''[[Krishna|{{Unicode|Kri<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>a}}]]'' is regarded as ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'' to whom all the demigods are subservient, and simultaneously, all the demigods are seen as mundane manifestations of {{Unicode|Kri<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>a}}. The third view is not supported by the scriptures. Whatever it is, the ''devas'' (also called ''{{Unicode|devat<U+0101>s}}'') are an integral part of the colorful Hindu culture. The 33 early Vedic ''devas'' included ''[[Indra]]'', ''[[Agni]]'', ''[[Soma]]'', ''[[Varuna|{{Unicode|Varu<U+1E47>a}}]]'', ''[[Mitra]]'', ''[[Savitri|{{Unicode|Savit<U+1E5B>}}]]'', ''[[Rudra]]'', ''[[Prajapati|{{Unicode|Praj<U+0101>pati}}]]'', ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}]]'', ''[[Aryaman]]'' and the ''[[Ashvin]]s''; important ''{{Unicode|dev<U+012B>s}}'' were ''[[Sarasvati|{{Unicode|Sarasvat<U+012B>}}]]'', ''[[Ushas|{{Unicode|<U+016A><U+1E63>h<U+0101>}}]]'' and ''[[Prithvi|{{Unicode|P<U+1E5B>ithiv<U+012B>}}]]''. ''Indra'' is traditionally called the king of the demigods. The later {{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>as}} laud the Hindu Trinity of ''[[Brahma|{{Unicode|Brahm<U+0101>}}]]'', ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}]]'' and ''[[Shiva]]'', i.e., ''[[Trimurti|{{Unicode|Trim<U+016B>rti}}]]'', signifying respectively the creative, ruling and destroying aspects of the same One God. Note that ''{{Unicode|Brahm<U+0101>}}'', ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>hnu}}'' and ''Shiva'' are not regarded as ordinary ''devas'' but as '''''{{Unicode|Mah<U+0101>devas}}'''''. The ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>as}}'' also laud other ''devas'' and ''[[avatar|{{Unicode|avat<U+0101>ras}}]]'' such as ''[[Ganesha|{{Unicode|Ga<U+1E47>esha}}]]'', ''[[Hanuman|Hanum<U+0101>n]]'', ''[[Rama|{{Unicode|R<U+0101>ma}}]]'', ''[[Krishna|{{Unicode|Kri<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>a}}]]'', etc. ''{{Unicode|Dev<U+012B>s}}'', worshipped as the mother, include ''[[Lakshmi|{{Unicode|Lak<U+1E63>hm<U+012B>}}]]'', ''[[Saraswati]]'' and ''[[Parvati]]'' and most importantly, ''[[Durga|{{Unicode|Durg<U+0101>}}]]'' and her forms such as ''[[Kali|{{Unicode|K<U+0101>l<U+012B>}}]]''.

===Practice (Yoga Dharma) ===
Hinduism includes a variety of practices, primarily spiritual devotion (''[[Bhakti Yoga]]''), selfless service (''[[Karma Yoga]]''), knowledge (''[[Jnana Yoga|{{Unicode|J<U+00F1><U+0101>na Yoga}}]]'') and meditation (''[[Raja Yoga|{{Unicode|R<U+0101>ja Yoga}}]]''). These are described in the two principal texts of Hindu [[Yoga]]: The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{Unicode|Bhagavad G<U+012B>t<U+0101>}}]]'' and the ''[[Yoga Sutras|Yoga S<U+016B>tras]]''. The ''[[Upanishad]]s'' are also important as a philosophical foundation for these practices. The Yogas provide a sort of alternate path (or faiths) that links together various Hindu beliefs, and can also be used to categorise non-Hindu beliefs that are seen as paths to {{Unicode|mok<U+1E63>ha}}, or ''[[nirvana|{{Unicode|nirv<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}]]''.

===The four pursuits of life=== 
Another major aspect of Hindu ''dharma'' that is common to practically all Hindus is that of the ''[[purusharthas|{{Unicode|puru<U+1E63>h<U+0101>rthas}}]]'', the "four pursuits of life". They are ''[[dharma]]'', ''[[artha]]'', ''[[Kama (Purusharthas)|{{Unicode|k<U+0101>ma}}]]'' and ''[[moksha|{{Unicode|mok<U+1E63>ha}}]]''. It is said that all beings seek ''{{Unicode|k<U+0101>ma}}'' (pleasure, physical or emotional) and ''artha'' (material wealth), but soon, with maturity, learn to govern these legitimate desires within the higher framework of ''dharma'' (righteousness). Of course, the only goal that is truly ultimate, whose attainment results in ultimate happiness, is ''{{Unicode|mok<U+1E63>ha}}'' (salvation), also known as ''[[Mukti]]'' (spiritual liberation), ''[[Samadhi|{{Unicode|Sam<U+0101>dhi}}]]'', ''[[Nirvana|{{Unicode|Nirv<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}]]'', or escape from ''[[Samsara|{{Unicode|Sams<U+0101>ra}}]]'' (the cycle of births and deaths).

Another perspective on these (i.e. dharma, artha, kama, moksha) is that artha and kama are to be pursued like a river which is bounded by dharma and moksha on the two sides.

===The four stages of life===
Ideally (though not feasible for most of today's lay Hindus), the human life is divided into four ''[[Ashrama|{{Unicode|<U+0100>shrama}}]]s'' ("phases" or "stages"). They are ''[[Brahmacharya]]'', ''[[Grihastha|{{Unicode|G<U+1E5B>ihastha}}]]'', ''[[Vanaprastha|{{Unicode|V<U+0101>naprastha}}]]'' and ''[[Sanyasa|{{Unicode|Sany<U+0101>sa}}]]''. The first quarter of one's life, ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' ("meditation, or study of the ''Brahman''") is spent in [[celibate]], controlled, [[sober]] and pure contemplation under a [[Guru]], building up the mind for the realization of truth. ''[[Grihastha]]'' is the [[householder]]'s stage, alternatively known as ''[[samsara]]'', in which one marries and satisfies ''[[Kama (Hinduism)|{{Unicode|k<U+0101>ma}}]]'' and ''[[artha]]'' within one's married and ''[[professional]]'' life. ''[[Vanaprastha|{{Unicode|V<U+0101>naprastha}}]]'' is gradual detachment from the [[material world]], ostensibly giving over duties to one's children, spending more time in [[contemplation]] of the Divine, and making holy [[pilgrimage]]s. Finally, in ''[[sanyasa|{{Unicode|Sany<U+0101>sa}}]]'', the individual goes into seclusion, often envisioned as renunciation, to find the Divine through detachment from worldly life, and peacefully shed the body for the next life (or, for liberation).

===The four classes of society===
Hindu society has traditionally been divided into four classes, based on profession<U+2014>the  ''[[Brahmin|{{Unicode|Br<U+0101>hma<U+1E47>as}}]]'' (also anglicised as Brahmins): teachers and priests; the ''[[Kshatriya|{{Unicode|K<U+1E63>hatriyas}}]]'': warriors, kings and administrators; the ''[[Vaishya|{{Unicode|Vaishyas}}]]'': farmers, merchants, herdsmen and businessmen; and the ''[[Shudra|{{Unicode|Sh<U+016B>dras}}]]'': servants and labourers. Each of these classes was called a ''{{Unicode|var<U+1E47>a}}'', and the system was called ''{{Unicode|Var<U+1E47>a Vyavasth<U+0101>}}''. It is debatable whether the ''{{Unicode|var<U+1E47>a}}'' system is an integral part of Hinduism or not; and whether or not it is strictly sanctioned by the scriptures. The ''Shruti'' texts make very rare mentions of this system, without providing explicit definitions. The ''{{Unicode|Sm<U+1E5B>iti}}'' texts (including the ''[[Manusmriti|{{Unicode|Manusm<U+1E5B>iti}}]]'') are more explicit in their categorisation of the classes <ref name=manusmriti>[http://www.bergen.edu/phr/121/ManuGC.pdf ''Manu Smriti'' Laws of Manu] 1.87-1.91</ref> and framing rather strict rules about this system. During its early development, the social structure was based upon the profession. It is noteworthy that many great sages '''became''' Brahmins. ''[[Vishwamitra|{{Unicode|Vishv<U+0101>mitra}}]]'' was a ''[[Kshatriya|{{Unicode|K<U+1E63>hatriya}}]]'' king before he became recognized as a great Brahmin sage. ''[[Valmiki|{{Unicode|V<U+0101>lmiki}}]]'', once a robber, became a great sage while ''[[Veda Vyasa|{{Unicode|Veda Vy<U+0101>sa}}]]'' was the son of a fisherwoman <ref name=varna>Sabhlok, Prem. [http://www.sabhlokcity.com/metaphysics/metaphysics.pdf "Glimpses of Vedic Metaphysics"]. Page 21</ref>. A hymn from the Rig Veda says : 
:''"I am a bard, my father is a physician, my mother's job is to grind the corn......" ''  
:(Rig Veda 9.112.3). 
Though historians do not agree on the specific period, the social system later became hierarchical and based upon birth, leading to the evolution of several sub-castes (along with a class of outcastes &mdash; now known as [[Dalit]]s &mdash; outside the ''{{Unicode|Var<U+1E47>a Vyavasth<U+0101>}}'') and the practice of social discrimination of the ''{{Unicode|Sh<U+016B>dra}}'' and ''Dalit'' classes. Thus, it evolved to form the [[caste system]] as we know of today. However, Article 15 of the [[Indian Constitution]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of an individual's caste, while Article 17 prohibits practice of the social stigma of [[untouchability]] <ref name=indianconstitution>[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/p03.htm "The Indian Constitution"]. Part III (Articles 15 & 17). "Fundamental Rights"</ref>. In contemporary India, caste differences are slowly disappearing with modernization, but occasional tensions and prejudices still remain.

== Denominations ==
{{main|Hindu denominations}}
[[Image:Pashupatinathskc.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The temple of [[Pashupatinath]] in [[Nepal]] is regarded as one of the most sacred places in [[Shaivism]].]]
Contemporary Hinduism is now divided into four major divisions, [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], and [[Smartism]]. <!-- comment out this statement until it can be sourced

Vaishnavism has 580 million followers, while Shaivism has 220 million followers.{{citation needed}}

--> The primary differences are between the sects of Vaishnavism which conceives God as ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}]]'', and Shaivism which conceives God as ''[[Shiva]]''. Vaishnavas make up the majority of Hindus in India. Shaktism worships a female divine or goddess ''[[Devi|{{Unicode|Dev<U+012B>}}]]'' or alternatively (where it is viewed as a sub sect of Shaivism) as the power of ''Shiva'' personified. Smartism, in contrast, believes in all religions being the same and leading to a [[panentheism|pantheistic]] God. A number of movements have also given rise to sects like Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]]'s ''[[Arya Samaj|{{Unicode|<U+0100>rya Sam<U+0101>j}}]]'' which condemns [[iconolatry]], veneration of multiple deities and focuses on the ''Vedas'' and the Vedic fire-sacrifices (''[[yagna|yaj<U+00F1>a]]'').

Each of the major denominations share [[rituals]], [[beliefs]], traditions and personal deities with each another, but each sect has a different philosophy on how to achieve life's ultimate goal (''[[Moksha|{{Unicode|Mok<U+1E63>ha}}]]'', salvation) and on their concept of God (''[[Ishvara|{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}]]''). However, each denomination respects all others, and conflict of any kind is rare. In fact, many Hindus will not claim to belong to any denomination at all.

== Hindu sacred texts ==
{{main|Hindu scripture}}
[[Image:Classification Hindu Scripture.gif |thumb|200px|Classification of Major Scriptures]]
The overwhelming majority of Hindu [[scripture|sacred texts]] are composed in the [[Sanskrit language]]. Indeed, much of the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[linguistic]] philosophy inherent in the learning of Sanskrit is sometimes claimed to be inextricably linked to study of the Vedas and relevant Hindu scriptures.

===Shruti===
{{main|<U+015A>ruti (scripture)}}
[[Image:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Rigveda]]'' is one of the world's oldest [[religious texts]]. Shown here is a Rigveda [[manuscript]] in [[Devanagari]], early 19th century.]]
The ''[[Veda]]s'' ({{Unicode|<U+0935><U+0947><U+0926>}}, literally, "Knowledge") are considered as ''Shruti'' by the Hindus. They are said to have been revealed by the ''[[Brahman]]'' to the ''[[rishi|{{Unicode|<U+1E5A>i<U+1E63>hi}}]]s'' while the latter were in deep meditation. While the overwhelming majority of Hindus may never read the ''[[Veda]]s'', there prevails in them a reverence for this transcendental notion of "Eternal Knowledge". The four ''[[Veda]]s'' (the ''[[Rig Veda|{{Unicode|<U+1E5A>ig}}]], [[Yajur Veda|Yajur]], [[Sama Veda|{{Unicode|S<U+0101>ma}}]] and [[Atharva Veda]]s'') are various ''{{Unicode|sh<U+0101>kh<U+0101>s}}'' or branches of knowledge. Depending on the branch, different commentaries and instructions are associated with each Veda. The ''{{Unicode|<U+1E5A>ig}} Veda'' contains mantras to invoke the ''devas'' for the fire-sacrifice rituals, the ''{{Unicode|S<U+0101>ma}} Veda'' has chants to be sung there, the ''Yajur Veda'' has actual prosaic instructions for the sacrifices and the ''Atharva Veda'' comprises of semi-magical (sic) spells against enemies, sorcerers, diseases and mistakes during the sacrificing ritual. The Vedas, apart from the hymn (''[[mantra]]'') or the ''[[Samhita|{{Unicode|Sa<U+1E43>hit<U+0101>}}]]'' (<U+0938><U+0902><U+0939><U+093F><U+0924><U+093E>) portion, also have three layers of commentaries integrally incorporated within them. These are: the ''[[Brahmana|Br<U+0101>hma<U+1E47>as]]'' (<U+092C><U+094D><U+0930><U+093E><U+0939><U+094D><U+092E><U+0923>, not to be confused with ''Brahman'' or the caste brahmin) containing prose commentaries on the rituals, the ''[[Aranyaka|{{Unicode|<U+0100>ra<U+1E47>yakas}}]]'' (<U+0906><U+0930><U+0923><U+094D><U+092F><U+0915>) containing the mystical explanations of the mantras, and the ''[[Upanishad|{{Unicode|Upani<U+1E63>hads}}]]'' (<U+0909><U+092A><U+0928><U+093F><U+0937><U+0926><U+094D>) containing highly philosophical and metaphysical writings about the nature of, and the relationship between the soul (''[[Atman|{{Unicode|<U+0101>tman}}]]'') and the ''[[Brahman]]''. Each Veda also has various law books and ritual manuals loosely associated with it, like the ''[[Dharmashastra|{{Unicode|Dharmash<U+0101>stra}}]]s'', ''{{Unicode|Grihyas<U+016B>tras}}'', etc., but most people do not consider them as an integral part of the ''Shruti'' or the Vedic literature.

The ''{{Unicode|Upani<U+1E63>hads}}'' set Hindu philosophy apart with its embrace of transcendent and yet multiple immanent forces that is subjective to each individual, seen by some as an identification of unity in diversity. Modern indology suggests that while early Hinduism is most reliant on the four [[Veda]]s, Classical Hinduism, from the ''[[Yoga]]'' and ''[[Vedanta]]'' to ''[[Tantra]]'' and ''[[Bhakti]]'' streams, was moulded around the ''{{Unicode|Upani<U+1E63>hads}}''. The Vedas are full of mysticism and allegories. The very sound of the Vedic mantras is considered as "purifying" by many Hindus, hence the rigour in learning pronunciation. The rigorous oral tradition of transmitting the Vedas has helped in its preservation.

===Bhagavad Gita===
{{main|Bhagavad Gita}}
''{{Unicode|Bhagavad G<U+012B>t<U+0101>}}'' (<U+092D><U+093E><U+0917><U+0935><U+0926><U+094D> <U+0917><U+0940><U+0924><U+093E>), often referred to as the ''{{Unicode|G<U+012B>t<U+0101>}}'', is one of the most popular sacred texts of Hinduism. It is an integral part of the epic ''[[Mahabharata|{{Unicode|Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata}}]]'', and contains philosophical sermons taught by ''[[Krishna|{{Unicode|K<U+1E5B>i<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>a}}]]'', an incarnation of ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}'', to the ''{{Unicode|P<U+0101><U+1E47><U+1E0D>ava}}'' princes just before a great war. Unlike the ''Vedas'', which are more [[esoteric]] and intricate, the ''{{Unicode|G<U+012B>t<U+0101>}}'' is read by many practicing Hindus. It is a summary of the [[Vedic religion|Vedic]], [[Yoga|Yogic]], [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] and [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantric]] branches of [[Hindu philosophy|philosophy]]. The ''{{Unicode|Bhagavad G<U+012B>t<U+0101>}}'' is described as the essence of the ''Vedas''.

===Smriti===
{{main|Smriti}}
The other Hindu texts form the latter category<U+2014>the '''''{{unicode|Sm<U+1E5B>itis}}''''' (lit., "memory"), all of which laud the ''Vedas''; the most notable of them are the ''[[Mahabharata|{{Unicode|Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata}}]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana|{{Unicode|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>ya<U+1E47>a}}]]'', major [[epic poetry|epic]]s considered sacred by almost all followers of ''San{{Unicode|<U+0101>}}tana Dharma''. Their stories are arguably familiar to the vast majority of Hindus. Other texts considered important by today's Hindus include the ''{{Unicode|Shr<U+012B>mad Bh<U+0101>gavatam}}'', described as the spotless epic detailing devotion to ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>hnu}}'' as the highest goal, ''[[Devi Mahatmya|{{Unicode|Dev<U+012B> Mah<U+0101>tmya}}]]'', an ode to ''[[Devi|{{Unicode|Dev<U+012B>}}]]'', and the ''[[Yoga Sutras|{{Unicode|Yoga S<U+016B>tras}}]]'', a key meditative yoga text of ''Shri [[Patanjali|{{Unicode|Pata<U+00F1>jali}}]]''. There are also a number of revered Hindu ''[[Tantras]]'', the ''[[Manusmriti|{{unicode|Manusm<U+1E5B>iti}}]]'', the 18 ''[[Purana|{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}]]s'' which vividly describe later Hinduism's deities and mythology, and [[List of sutras|{{Unicode|S<U+016B>tras}}]] that command the respect of various Hindu sects of different persuasion, some including the ''{{Unicode|Mahanirv<U+0101><U+1E47>a Tantra}}'', ''[[Tirumantiram]]'' and ''[[Shiva Sutras|{{Unicode|Shiva S<U+016B>tras}}]]''. The eighteen ''[[Purana|{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}]]s'', or ''Ancients'', are divided into three groups of six. The ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}s<U+2019>'' groups and their contents are: 1) the ''{{Unicode|Brahm<U+0101> Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}s'': ''{{Unicode|Brahma Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', ''{{Unicode|Brahm<U+0101><U+1E47><U+1E0D>a Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', ''Brahma Vaivarta'' ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', ''{{Unicode|M<U+0101>rka<U+1E47><U+1E0D>eya Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', ''{{Unicode|Bhavi<U+1E63>hya Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', and the ''{{Unicode|V<U+0101>mana Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}''; 2) the ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>hnu Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}s'': the ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>hnu Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', the ''{{Unicode|Bh<U+0101>gavata Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', the ''{{Unicode|N<U+0101>radeya Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', the ''{{Unicode|Garu<U+1E0D>a Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', the ''Padma'' ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', and the ''{{Unicode|Var<U+0101>ha Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}''; and 3) the ''Shiva'' ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}s'': the ''{{Unicode|V<U+0101>yu Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', the ''{{Unicode|Li<U+1E45>ga Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', the ''Skanda {{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'' , the ''Agni'' ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', the ''Matsya'' ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}'', and the ''Karma'' ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}''. The ''{{Unicode|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>ya<U+1E47>a}}'', ''{{Unicode|Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata}}'' and many ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>as}}'' are much more widely read by today's Hindus than the ''Vedas'', and the temple and icon worship of modern Hinduism is attributable to them. It is interesting to note that the Hindus attach much more importance to the ethics and the metaphorical meanings conveyed by these texts, rather than only the literal mythology. Other important scriptures are the sectarian ''[[Hindu Agamas|Hindu {{Unicode|<U+0100>gamas}}]]'' which are texts related to rituals and worship and is dedicated to ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>hnu}}'', ''Shiva'' and ''{{Unicode|Dev<U+012B>}}''. The ''Shruti'' takes precedence over the ''{{unicode|Sm<U+1E5B>iti}}'' in any matter of apparent mutual dispute. However, many Vaishnavites regard the ''{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>as}}'' to be as authoritative as the ''Vedas''.

== Origins and society ==
===Origins of Hinduism ===
{{main|History of Hinduism}}
[[ Image:Kailash_Tibet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sacred [[Mount Kailash]] in [[Tibet]] is regarded in many denominations as the spiritual center of the world.]]
The roots of Hinduism date from around 1500<U+2013>1300 BCE, though the beliefs and practices of this era are more accurately termed, "Vedism." Fully-formed Hinduism did not emerge until these Vedic traditions interacted with the shramanical movements of Buddhism and Jainism. The synthesis of Vedic ritual and pantheon with the non-violent and gnostic traditions of the shramanas yielded the complex we know today as "Hinduism." 

From the perspective of a believing Hindu, however, the ''[[Sanatana Dharma|{{Unicode|San<U+0101>tana Dharma}}]]'' propounds eternal and universal principles with no beginning or end. The ''[[Purana|{{Unicode|Pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a}}]]s'' place Lord ''{{Unicode|K<U+1E5B>i<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>a}}''<U+2019>s birth at around 3100 BCE. ''{{Unicode|K<U+1E5B>i<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>a}}''<U+2019>s incarnation was preceded by Lord ''[[Rama|{{Unicode|R<U+0101>ma}}]]''<U+2019>s, sometimes dated at over 5<U+2013>6000 BCE, or even more than a million years ago in the [[Treta Yuga|{{Unicode|Tret<U+0101> Yuga}}]] according to the ''{{Unicode|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>ya<U+1E47>a}}'' Epic. Many Hindus believe that their religious tradition was fully formed by the time of Lord ''[[Rama|{{Unicode|R<U+0101>ma}}]]'', the seventh incarnation of Lord ''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}]]''. Modern [[Indology]] dates the roots of Hinduism to about 1500-1300 BCE, based on [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and literary data from the Rig Veda, believed to be composed around a similar period, though it is accepted that they were transmitted orally from at least 1800-1500 BCE. These dates are based on the [[Indo-Aryan migration]] hypothesis, which posits an influx of Sanskrit-speaking [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] peoples and or culture into North India in the early 2nd millennium BCE.

The origin of collective Hindu thought cannot be ascribed to any single founder (though most of its later schools of philosophy and belief can be), or associated with a specific time or a single place of foundation. The Vedas, the earliest Hindu scriptures, are the compilation of spiritual laws and truths binding upon all of creation. It is believed that each Veda was revealed to enlightened sages, called ''[[Rishi|{{Unicode|<U+1E5A>i<U+1E63>hi}}]]s'', over a long period of time. Hinduism, along with [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], is regarded to be an ''[[Arya|{{Unicode|<U+0100>rya}}]] [[Dharma]]'', meaning, a noble religion.

===Vedic religion===

[[Image:Babasteve-View_of_Varanasi_from_the_Ganges.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Varanasi]] is the oldest living city in the world and is considered as one of the most sacred places of [[pilgrimage]] for Hindus irrespective of denomination.[http://www.varanasicity.com/history-of-varanasi.html] ]]
Modern Hinduism grew out of the knowledge described in the [[Vedas]]. The earliest of these, the ''[[Rigveda|{{Unicode|<U+1E5A>gveda}}]]'' centers on worship of celestial spirits such as ''[[Indra]]'', ''[[Varuna]]'' and ''[[Agni]]'', and on the ''[[Soma]]'' ritual. The early Indo-Aryans would perform '''fire-sacrifices''', called ''[[yagna|{{Unicode|yaj<U+00F1>a}}]]'' (<U+092F><U+091C><U+094D><U+091E>), with the chanting of the Vedic mantras, but they built no temples, idols or icons. Probably animals were also sacrificed in larger ''{{Unicode|yaj<U+00F1>as}}'', as claimed by Buddhist and Jain texts. The age and origins of the Vedas themselves are disputed, but it is clear that they were transmitted orally for several centuries, if not several millennia. They show strong similarities to the language and religion of the ''[[Avesta]]'' (of [[Zoroastrianism]]), as well as more distantly to other [[Indo-European languages]] and religions (see [[Indo-Aryan migration]]). The ''[[Rigveda|{{Unicode|<U+1E5A>gvedic}}]]'' deity ''Dyaus'', regarded as the father of the other deities, is linguistically cognate with [[Zeus]]<U+2014>the king of the gods in [[Greek mythology]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jovius]] (''gen. of'' Jupiter)<U+2014>the king of the gods in [[Roman mythology]], and [[Ziu]] in Germanic mythology.

===Temples===
{{main|Mandir}}
[[Image:Tirumala svtemple.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hindu temples have their principal shrine facing the rising sun and their entrance facing east. An important aspect of the temple design is that it is intended to lead from the temporal world to the eternal one. Shown here is the [[Tirupati]] temple, the second richest religious shrine after the Vatican.]]Hindu temples inherited rich and ancient rituals and customs, and have occupied a special place in Hindu society. They are usually dedicated to a primary deity, called the presiding deity, and other subordinate deities associated with the main deity. However, some ''mandirs'' are dedicated to multiple deities. Most major temples are constructed as per the ''[[agama|{{Unicode|<U+0101>gama sh<U+0101>stras}}]]'' and many are sites of [[pilgrimage]]. For many Hindus, the four '''''{{Unicode|Shankar<U+0101>ch<U+0101>ryas}}''''' (the abbots of the monasteries of [[Jyotirmath|Joshimath]], [[Govardhana matha|Puri]], [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|Shringeri]] and [[Dwaraka P<U+012B>tha|Dwarka]]) <U+2014> four of the holiest pilgrimage centers <U+2014> sometimes to which a fifth at [[Kanchi matha|Kanchi]] is also added) are viewed as the four highest [[Patriarch]]s of the Hindudom.
Temples are a place for ''darshan'' (vision of the Divine), ''[[puja|{{Unicode|p<U+016B>j<U+0101>}}]]'', [[meditation]], and religious congregation (though not so regular and often as among the Muslims and the Christians) <U+2014> among other religious activities. ''[[puja|{{Unicode|P<U+016B>j<U+0101>}}]]'' or worship, frequently uses the aid of a ''[[#Forms of worship: icons and mantras|{{Unicode|m<U+016B>rti}}]]'' (statue in which divine presence is invoked) in conjunction with the singing or chanting of meditational prayer in the form of [[mantra]]s. Devotional songs called ''[[bhajan]]s'' (written primarily from the 14th-17th centuries), ''[[kirtan|{{Unicode|k<U+012B>rtan}}]]'' (devotional songs), and ''[[arti|{{Unicode|<U+0101>rat<U+012B>}}]]'' are sometimes sung in conjunction with the performance of the ''{{Unicode|p<U+016B>j<U+0101>}}''. This rather organic system of devotion attempts to aid the individual in connecting with God through symbolic communion.

==Hindu philosophy: the six Vedic schools of thought==
{{main|Hindu philosophy}}
The six ''{{Unicode|<U+0100>stika}}'' or orthodox schools (accepting the authority of the Vedas) of Hindu philosophy are ''[[Nyaya|{{Unicode|Ny<U+0101>ya}}]]'', ''[[Vaisheshika|{{Unicode|Vaishe<U+1E63>hika}}]]'', ''[[Samkhya|{{Unicode|S<U+0101><U+1E43>khya}}]]'', ''[[Yoga]]'', ''[[Purva Mimamsa|{{Unicode|P<U+016B>rva M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>s<U+0101>}}]]'' (also simply called ''{{Unicode|M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>s<U+0101>}}''), and ''[[Vedanta|{{Unicode|Uttara M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>s<U+0101>}}]]'' (also called ''[[Vedanta|{{Unicode|Ved<U+0101>nta}}]]''). The non-Vedic schools are called ''{{Unicode|N<U+0101>stika}}'', or heterodox, and refer to [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and ''[[Lokayata|{{Unicode|Lok<U+0101>yata}}]]''. The schools that continue to enrich Hinduism today are ''[[Purva Mimamsa|{{Unicode|P<U+016B>rva M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>s<U+0101>}}]]'', ''[[Yoga]]'', and ''[[Vedanta|{{Unicode|Ved<U+0101>nta}}]]''. See [[Hindu philosophy]] for a discussion of the historical significance of ''[[Samkhya|{{Unicode|S<U+0101><U+1E43>khya}}]]'', ''[[Nyaya|{{Unicode|Ny<U+0101>ya}}]]'', and ''[[Vaisheshika|{{Unicode|Vaishe<U+1E63>hika}}]]''.

===Purva Mimamsa===
{{main|Purva Mimamsa}}
The main objective of ''[[Purva Mimamsa|{{Unicode|P<U+016B>rva (i.e., earlier) M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>s<U+0101>}}]]'' school (also simply called ''{{Unicode|M<U+012B>m<U+0101><U+1E43>s<U+0101>}}'') was to firmly establish the authority of the Vedas. Consequently, this school's most valuable contribution to Hinduism was its formulation of the rules of interpretation of Vedas. Its adherents believed that true knowledge is self-evidently proven, and tried to find out the basis of the Vedic ritualism through reasoning. This school of thought forms the basis of Modern Hindu ritualism (strictly followed only by a minority), which believes in the inherent power of rituals.

===Yoga===
{{main|Yoga}}
[[Image:Yoga instructor.jpg|thumb|225px|right|In Hinduism, Yoga is considered to be the ultimate way of attaining spiritual goals. The earliest written accounts of yoga appear in the [[Rig Veda]], which began to be codified between 1500 and 1200 BCE.]]
'''''Yoga''''' means ''union'' and is generally interpreted as union with the Divine, or integration of body, mind, and spirit. Its goal is ''[[moksha|{{Unicode|mok<U+1E63>ha}}]]'', or ''[[samadhi|{{Unicode|sam<U+0101>dhi}}]]''. It, like the ''[[Upanishad|{{Unicode|Upani<U+1E63>had}}]]s'', seeks liberation through the disunion of the spirit (''[[Purusha|{{Unicode|Puru<U+1E63>ha}}]]'') and the nature (''[[Prakriti|{{Unicode|Prak<U+1E5B>iti}}]]''), through meditational, physical and spiritual practices, along with a firm belief in God (''[[Ishvara|{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}]]'').

The ''[[Upanishad|{{Unicode|Upani<U+1E63>had}}]]s'', sage ''[[Patanjali|{{Unicode|Pata<U+00F1>jali}}]]''<U+2019>s ''[[Yoga Sutra|{{Unicode|Yoga S<U+016B>tra}}]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{Unicode|Bhagavad G<U+012B>t<U+0101>}}]]'' are indispensable literature to the study of ''Yoga''; they elaborate on ''[[Raja Yoga|{{Unicode|R<U+0101>ja Yoga}}]]'', ''[[Bhakti Yoga]]'', ''[[Karma Yoga]]'' and ''[[Jnana Yoga]]''. Of these, the ''[[Yoga Sutra|{{Unicode|Yoga S<U+016B>tra}}]]'' is essentially a compilation and systematization of meditational ''Yoga'' philosophy.

===Uttara Mimamsa: The Three Schools of Vedanta===
The Uttara ("later") Mimamsa school is perhaps the central pillar of Hinduism and certainly was responsible for a new wave of philosophical and meditative inquiry, renewal of faith, and cultural reform. Primarily associated with the [[Upanishad]]s and their commentary by [[Badarayana]], the [[Vedanta Sutra]]s, Vedanta thought split into three groups, initiated by the thinking and writing of [[Adi Sankara]]. Most Hindu thought today in some way relates to changes affected by [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] thought (e.g., [[ISKCON]], which follows ''{{IAST|Achintya-bhed<U+0101>bheda}}'' Vedantic philosophy), which focused on meditation, morality and centeredness on the one Self rather than on rituals and meaningless societal distinctions like [[caste]]. See [[Vedanta]] for greater depth.

====Pure Monism: Advaita Vedanta====
''Main article: [[Advaita Vedanta]]''

Advaita literally means "not two"; thus this is what we refer to as a monistic (or non-dualistic) system, which emphasises oneness. Its consolidator was [[Adi_Sankara|Shankara]] (788-820). Adi Shankara expounded his theories largely based on previous teachings of the [[Upanishad]]s and his own [[guru]] [[Gaudapada]]. In this philosophy, when a human being tries to know the '''Cosmic Spirit''' (''Brahman'') through his mind, ''Brahman'' becomes the '''Supreme Lord''' (''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}''), under the effect of an illusionary power of ''Brahman'' called ''[[Maya (Hinduism)|{{Unicode|M<U+0101>y<U+0101>}}]]''. An analogy is given that when the reflection of ''Brahman'' falls upon the mirror of ''{{Unicode|M<U+0101>y<U+0101>}}'', its image is seen as ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}''. The material universe and the appearance of the single Atman to be seen as innumerable individual souls are also because of ''{{Unicode|M<U+0101>y<U+0101>}}''. Note that God is still perfect and untouched by the profanity of his divine power ''{{Unicode|M<U+0101>y<U+0101>}}'', just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic. In this level of reality<U+2014>the pragmatic level, God creates and rules the world with the help of his ''{{Unicode|M<U+0101>y<U+0101>}}''. True knowledge of the ''Brahman'' (''{{Unicode|J<U+00F1><U+0101>na}}'') is the only way to liberation; when the curtain of ''{{Unicode|M<U+0101>y<U+0101>}}'' gets removed, the person realizes that there is absolutely no difference between the individual soul (''{{Unicode|<U+0101>tman}}'') and ''Brahman''<U+2014>which is the transcendental level of reality. However, good ''Karma'' and ''Bhakti'' are recognized as great help in attaining true knowledge.  Adi Shankara denounced [[caste]] and meaningless [[ritual]] as foolish, and in his own charismatic manner, exhorted the true devotee to meditate on God's love and apprehend truth.

====Qualified monism: [[Vishistadvaita]] [[Bhakti]]-Vedanta====
{{main|Vishistadvaita}}
[[Ramanuja|{{Unicode|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>nuja}}]] (1040 - 1137) was the foremost proponent of the concept of Sriman ''{{Unicode|N<U+0101>r<U+0101>ya<U+1E47>a}}'' as the supreme ''Brahman''. He taught that Ultimate Reality had three aspects: ''{{Unicode|<U+012A>shvara}}'' (''[[Vishnu|{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}]]''), ''chit'' (soul) and ''achit'' (matter). ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}'' is the only independent reality, while souls and matter are dependent on God ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}'' for their existence. Because of this qualification of Ultimate reality, ''{{Unicode|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>nuja}}''<U+2019>s system is known as qualified non-dualism. ''[[Karma]]'' along with ''[[Bhakti]]'' for is the true path for liberation.

====Dualism: [[Dvaita]] [[Vedanta]] ====
{{main|Dvaita}}
Like ''{{Unicode|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>nuja}}'', ''[[Shri Madhvacharya|Madhva]]'' (1238 - 1317) identified [[God]] with ''{{Unicode|Vi<U+1E63>h<U+1E47>u}}'', but his view was purely dualistic in that he understood a fundamental differentiation between the God, the individual soul and the material world and thus the system is called ''Dvaita'' (dualistic)  ''{{Unicode|Ved<U+0101>nta}}'' or ''tattvavada'' (argument for reality). ''[[Bhakti]]'' is the only way for liberation.

==Alternative cultures of worship==
===The Bhakti schools===
{{main|Bhakti}}
[[Image:Lord_Ganesha.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ganesha]] is the son of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] (pictured left). He is widely worshipped as ''[[Vignesh]]'', the remover of obstacles.]]
The ''[[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti]]'' (Devotional) school takes its name from the Hindu term that signifies a blissful, selfless and overwhelming devotion of God as the beloved Father, Mother, Child, or whatever relationship finds appeal in the devotee's heart. The philosophy of ''Bhakti'' seeks to relate to the personal form of God. Seen as a form of ''[[Yoga]]'', or union, it seeks to interlink the self with God, since consciousness of the body and limited mind as self is seen to be a limiting factor in spiritual realization. 
Essentially, it is God who effects all change, who is the source of all works, who acts through the devotee as love and light. 'Sins' and evil-doings of the devotee are said to fall away of their own accord through the devotion of God. The ''[[Bhakti]]'' movements rejuvenated Hinduism through their intense expression of devotion and their responsiveness to the emotional and philosophical needs of India.

===Tantra===
{{main|Tantra}}
''Tantra'' is one of the least understood areas of Hinduism <U+2014> often (wrongly) perceived as free sex associated with religion, is a class of works teaching magical and mystical formularies, as well as mythology, especially in the form of dialogues between ''[[Shiva]]'' and ''[[Durga|{{IAST|Durg<U+0101>}}]]''. ''Tantra'' means to stretch and expand. It also means a weaving. The word originally referred only to certain sacred texts or Tantras. A ''mantra'' is a hymn or sacred words associated with a deity. A ''mantra'' is associated with a ''Yantra'', which is a mystical diagram. 

''Tantras'' can be divided into two paths - The right hand path (also known as ''{{Unicode|samay<U+0101>ch<U+0101>ra}}'' or ''{{Unicode|Dak<U+1E63>hi<U+1E47><U+0101>ch<U+0101>ra}}'') and the Left hand path (''{{Unicode|V<U+0101>m<U+0101>ch<U+0101>ra}}''). Extolled as a short-cut to self-realization and spiritual enlightenment by some, left-hand tantric rites (somewhat like [[Shamanism]]) are often rejected as dangerous by most orthodox Hindus.

== Important themes and symbols in Hinduism==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:YoungBrahminBoy.jpg|thumb|175px|right|This young [[India]]n brahmachari bears on his forehead the distinctive triple-line [[tilaka]] (made out of ash, referred to as ''vibhuti'') and on his chest a [[rudraksha]] (eye of [[Rudra]]) and [[mala]] (rosary), both symbols of Lord [[Shiva]]]] -->
=== Tilaka (symbol on forehead or between eyebrows) ===
{{main|Tilaka}}
The ''tilaka'' (or ''tilak'') is a mark worn on the forehead and other parts of the body for spiritual reasons. It is believed to symbolize the need to cultivate supramental consciousness, which is achieved by opening the mystic ''third eye''. Traditionally tilaka is adorned, in one form or the other, by all Hindus (as a mark of faith of the particular tradition they belong to) and married women (to denote marriage and auspiciousness). In the modern context, it is most commonly seen as a decorative dot (or ''{{Unicode|Bind<U+012B>}}'') worn by women on the forehead.

Hindus stress meditation to acquire knowledge beyond the mind and body, a trait that is often associated with the ascetic deity ''[[Shiva]]''. Men, too, will bear on their foreheads the equivalent ''Tika'' (''[[tilaka]]'') mark, usually on religious occasions, its shape often representing particular devotion to a certain main deity: a 'U' shape stands for ''[[Vishnu]]'', a group of three horizontal lines for ''[[Shiva]]''. It is not uncommon for some to meld both in an amalgam marker signifying ''Hari-Hara'' (''Vishnu-Shiva'' indissoluble).

=== Ahimsa (non-violence), vegetarian diet and the cow ===
{{main articles|[[Ahimsa]], [[Sacred cow]], and [[Vegetarianism]]}}
Ahimsa is a concept that advocates non-violence and a respect for all forms of life <U+2014> human as well as animal. The term ''ahimsa'' first appears in the [[Upanishad]]s, and is the first of the five ''Yamas'', or eternal vows/restraints in [[Raja Yoga]]. In part at least, it has also been influenced from the teachings of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. 

A large section of Hindus embrace vegetarianism in a bid to respect higher forms of life. While vegetarianism is not a dogma or requirement, it is recommended as a [[sattwa|sattwic]] (purifying) lifestyle. About 30% of today's [[Hindu]] population, especially in orthodox communities in [[South India]], states like Gujarat, which has had significant [[Jain]] influence, and in many [[Brahmin]] and [[Marwari]] enclaves around the subcontinent, are lacto-vegetarian.<ref>Deep Vegetarianism (1999) by: Michael Allen Fox.</ref> Some avoid even [[onion]] and [[garlic]], as they are regarded as [[rajasic]]/tamasic.

Those [[Hindus]] who do eat meat (usually chicken, goat and fish) predominantly abstain from [[beef]]. Some even avoid the use of cow's leather products. This is possibly because the largely pastoral Vedic people, and subsequent generations, relied so heavily on the cow for milk and dairy products, tilling of fields and fuel for fertilizer, that its status as a 'caretaker' led to identifying it as an almost maternal figure (hence the term ''gau mata'', or ''Cow Mother''). While most contemporary Hindus do not actually worship the cow (though many [[veneration|venerate]] her), it still holds an honored place in Hindu society <U+2014> as the best representative of the benevolence of all animals on man. There exists a legal ban against cow-slaughter in almost all states of the Indian Union.

=== Hindu symbolism ===
Among the most revered symbols in Hinduism, three are quintessentially a part of its culture, and representative of its general ethos:

[[Image:Om2.jpg|right|left|thumb|165px|[[Aum]] ([[Om]])]]
[[Image:Hindu_swastika.png|right|thumb|165px|[[Swastika]]]]
[[Aum|'''''Aum''''']] (or Om, '''<U+0950>''') is the sacred symbol of Hinduism, and is prefixed and sometimes suffixed to all Hindu [[mantra]]s and prayers. It contains a deep symbolic message of the divine primordial vibration of the Universe, representing all existence, encompassing all of nature into the ''One Ultimate Reality''. This symbol is commonly found on necklaces worn by Hindus. In the Upanishads, it is defined as an affirmation, as in allowing or saying 'yes'.

'''[[Swastika]]''' ('''<U+5350>''') is an [[Arya]], or ''noble and auspicious'', symbol. It stands for purity of soul, [[satya]], truth, and stability within the power of [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]] or, alternatively, of [[Surya]], the sun. Its rotation in four directions has been used to represent many ideas, but primarily describes the four directions, the four Vedas and their harmonious whole. It has been used predominantly in Hinduism since the early [[Vedic civilization|Vedic culture]], and is still widespread in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Many other cultures continue to hold it as auspicious, in spite of the recent association with [[Nazism]], which used a clockwise, tilted version of this symbol called a ''Hakenkreuz'' standing for purity of race.

The '''[[Mandala]]''' of the hexagram, somewhat resembling the [[Star of David]], is an archetypal symbol for the sacred union of opposite energies. Formed by the intertwining of the "fire" and "water" triangles (the male "blade" and the female "chalice") this symbol represents the masculine and feminine principles in perfect union.

===Murtis (icons)===
{{main|Murti}}
[[Image:Nataraja.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The dancing posture of [[Siva]], known as the [[Nataraja]], is often said to be the supreme statement of Hindu art]]

Worship of God (the unique truth that can be seen by humans in any manifestation) is often represented symbolically through the aid of icons (''{{IAST|m<U+016B>rtiti}}'') which are conduits for the devotee's consciousness, markers for the human mind that signify the ineffable and illimitable nature of the power and grandeur of [[God]]. They are symbols of the greater principle and according to the understanding of the worshipper, the concept or entity is sometimes presumed to be present in them (in monotheistic doctrines) and sometimes not (in monistic doctrines). It bears mention that ''Shiva'' is almost always worshipped as a pillar-like stone called ''[[Lingam]]''. Some interpret the term ''lingam'' as a [[Phallus]] due to its shape and certain Puranic stories, but actually, this Sanskrit word means ''any'' sign, symbol, mark or badge in general. Others interpret it as a mystic column (''stambha'') trying to represent the infiniteness of ''Shiva''.

In a [[Mandir|Hindu Temple]], the divine spirit/energy is commonly invoked into the Murtis at the time of their consecration. [[Veneration]] of such Murtis is done everyday in a [[Mandir|temple]]. Most practicing Hindus also maintain a Puja room like a [[Mandir|temple]] in their homes for worship and meditation. The icons could be two-dimensional paintings or three-dimensional statues.

===Mantra===
{{main|Mantra}}

Reciting [[mantra]]s or incantations is a general practice in Hindu rituals. Many mantras are from the Vedas. Much of ''mantra yoga'', as it is called, is done through ''japa'' (repetition, usually through a [[rosary]]). Mantras are chanted, through their meaning, sound, and chanting style, to help meditational focus for the [[sadhaka]] (practitioner). They can also be used to aid in expression of love for the deity, another facet of [[Bhakti yoga]] akin to the understanding of the [[murti]]. They often give courage in exigent times and serve to help 'invoke' one's inner spiritual strength. Indeed, [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s dying words were a two-word [[mantra]] to the Lord [[Rama]]: ''"H<U+00E9> Ram!"'.

The most revered mantra in Hinduism is the famed [[Gayatri Mantra]] of the [[Rig Veda]] 3.62.10.  Many Hindus to this day, in a tradition that has continued unbroken for at least 3,000 years, perform morning ablutions at the bank of a sacred river (especially the [[Ganga]]/[[Ganges]]) while chanting this mantra.  [[Sanskrit]] is mostly used as a ceremonial language in Hindu religious rituals in the forms of [[hymns]] and [[mantras]].

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of Hinduism}}
Hinduism is criticized based on current or past regressive social customs such as [[Dowry]], [[Sati]] and [[Caste|casteism]]. Hinduism has also been viewed as polytheistic and promoting idol worship. The Hindu counter argument is that Hinduism, specifically Smarta or Advaitan Hinduism is not [[polytheistic]], though it may present an appearance of being so. [[monism|Monism]] or [[monistic theism|Monistic Theism]] is generally more apt definition of the Hindu worldview, with the exception of [[Dvaita]], or dualism. The existence of numerous ''human forms'' and ''idols'' of God is an implied principle in Hindu thought. Each ''human form'' or ''idol'' is associated with an important fable, and these representations help people remember and contemplate over them more easily. An icon is used to focus on God, rather than being the object of worship itself.

Another criticism is directed towards the rise of [[Hindu nationalism]] or [[Hindutva]] in India. In the 20th century, emerging Indian [[nationalism]] began to emphasize Hinduism, in opposition to the British Raj, but also in contrast to [[Islam]], and after independence in connection with the territorial disputes with [[Pakistan]]. Hindutva ideology rose to importance in the [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the [[1980s]] and is chiefly associated with the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] movement and the coming of [[Ayodhya| Ayodhya issue]] to the forefront of Indian politics.
