'''Daft Punk''' is a duo consisting of French [[musician]]s [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] (born February 8, 1974) and [[Thomas Bangalter]] (born January 3, 1975).<ref name="MusiqueVol.1" /> After Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 1990s [[house music|house]] movement in France, other artists such as [[Air (band)|Air]], [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]], and [[Dimitri from Paris]] began to receive a similar amount of attention.<ref name="Mixmag 2006" />

Daft Punk is also credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the [[French house]] scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by [[Pedro Winter]] (Busy P), the head of [[Ed Banger Records]].<ref name="Pedro"/>

==History==
===Early years (1987<U+2013>1993)===
[[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] met in 1987 on the grounds of the [[Lyc<U+00E9>e Carnot]], a secondary school in [[Paris]].<ref name="MusiqueVol.1">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060410194554/http://www.daft-musique.com/ Daft Punk Musique Vol. 1 Official Website]. [[Web archiving|Archived]] from April 10, 2006.</ref> The two became good friends and later recorded [[demo (music)|demo]] tracks with others from the school.<ref name="RFI Musique">[http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6151.asp RFI Musique - Biography - Daft Punk] rfimusique.com. Retrieved on March 3, 2007.</ref> This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group called Darlin' with [[Laurent Brancowitz]] in 1992.<ref name="DarlinBio" /> Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[guitar]], respectively, while Brancowitz performed on [[drum kit|drums]].<ref name="FrenchConn">James, Martin.

It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> A negative review in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' subsequently dubbed the music "a bunch of [[wiktionary:daft|daft]] [[Punk rock|punk]]." Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing.<ref name="RFI Musique" /> As the latter stated, "We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly."<ref name="DaftPulse">Alan Di Perna, "We Are The Robots" ''Pulse!'', April 2001, pp. 65-69.</ref> Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]].<ref name="DarlinBio" /> Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

===''Homework'' era (1993<U+2013>1999)===
In 1993 Daft Punk attended a [[rave]] at [[Disneyland Resort Paris|EuroDisney]], where they met Stuart Macmillan of [[Slam (band)|Slam]], co-founder of the label [[Soma Quality Recordings]].<ref name="RFI Musique" /> The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, "[[The New Wave]]", a limited release in 1994.<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> The single also contained the final mix of "The New Wave" called "Alive".

Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "[[Da Funk]]". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of "Da Funk", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose [[Pedro Winter]], who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs.<ref name="FrenchConn"/> The band signed with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.<ref name="MusiqueVol.1" /><ref name="FrenchConn"/>

"Da Funk" and "Alive" were later included on Daft Punk's [[1997 in music|1997 debut album]] ''[[Homework (album)|Homework]]''. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of [[techno]], [[house music|house]], [[acid house]] and [[electro (music)|electro]] styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the [[1990s|nineties]]. "Da Funk" was also included on ''[[The Saint (film)|The Saint]]'' film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of [[rave music|rave]] that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from ''Homework'' was "[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title. Daft Punk also produced a series of [[music video]]s for ''Homework'' directed by [[Spike Jonze]], [[Michel Gondry]], [[Roman Coppola]] and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled ''[[D.A.F.T. - A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes]]''.

===''Discovery'' era (1999<U+2013>2004)===
By 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier.<ref name="MTVeInterview" /> The 2001 release ''[[Discovery (Daft Punk album)|Discovery]]'' took on a slicker and distinctly [[synthpop]]-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in ''Homework''. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood.<ref name="ROBOPOP">Chris Gill, [http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_robopop/ "ROBOPOP"] (May 2001) ''Remix Magazine Online''. Retrieved on March 6, 2007.</ref> This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single "[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles "[[Digital Love]]" and "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and "[[Face to Face (Daft Punk song)|Face to Face]]" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/release/260250 Face to Face (Rare Remixes!)] [[Discogs]]. Retrieved on October 3, 2008.</ref> A 45-minute excerpt from a ''Daftendirektour'' performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled ''[[Alive 1997]]''.

2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film ''[[Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem]]''. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of [[Leiji Matsumoto]], whom they have said is their childhood hero.<ref name="5555Insert">''[[Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem]]'' companion leaflet (2003)</ref> The album ''[[Daft Club]]'' was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.

===''Human After All'' era (2004<U+2013>present)===
[[Image:Daft Punk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Daft Punk in their robotic suits]]
Starting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material.<ref>''Human After All'' liner notes (2005). Retrieved on December 17, 2007.</ref> The duo released the album ''[[Human After All]]'' in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were "[[Robot Rock (song)|Robot Rock]]", "[[Technologic]]", "[[Human After All (song)|Human After All]]" and "[[The Prime Time of Your Life]]". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was "we believe that ''Human After All'' speaks for itself."

A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled ''[[Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005]]'' was released on April 4, 2006. It contains new music videos for "The Prime Time of Your Life" and "Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)". Daft Punk also released a [[remix album]] of ''Human After All'' called ''[[Human After All#Remix album|Human After All: Remixes]]''. A limited edition included two [[kubrick (toy)|kubricks]] of Daft Punk as robots.

On May 21, 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, ''[[Daft Punk's Electroma]]'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] sidebar Director's Fortnight.<ref name="ElectromaReview">[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=features2006&content=jump&jump=review&dept=cannes&nav=RCannes&articleid=VE1117930614&cs=1 ''Daft Punk's Electroma'' review] variety.com.

Following the ''Alive 2007'' tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material.

==Influences==
[[Image:Daft Punk Human.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bangalter and de Homem-Christo years before the release of ''Homework'']]
Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing [[electronic music]] as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for [[Elton John]], [[MC5]], [[The Rolling Stones]], The Beach Boys and [[The Stooges]].<ref>''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' (March 2005).</ref><ref name="DarlinBio">[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Darlin' Darlin' biography] at [[Discogs]]. Retrieved on February 20, 2007.</ref> Their mutual admiration for [[rock music|rock]] bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that "It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997">Matthew Collin, ([http://www.techno.de/mixmag/97.08/DaftPunk.a.html "Do You Think You Can Hide From Stardom?"] (August 1997) ''[[Mixmag]]''. Retrieved on March 6, 2007.</ref> They drew inspiration from the rock and [[acid house]] displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to ''[[Screamadelica]]'' by [[Primal Scream]] as an influential work, as the record "put everything together" in terms of genre.<ref name="Mixmag 2006" />

The liner notes of ''Homework'' pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from [[Brian Wilson]]. Bangalter expressed that "In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like [[Bob Marley]], too."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, "before us you had [[Frankie Knuckles]] or [[Juan Atkins]] and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> The Daft Punk track "Teachers" on ''Homework'' refers to several influences including [[Romanthony]] and [[Todd Edwards]]. De Homem-Christo stated that "Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions <U+2014> the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul <U+2014> is part of how we sound today."<ref name="ROBOPOP" />

Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for ''Discovery''. For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the [[Aphex Twin]] single "[[Windowlicker]]", which was "neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track" according to Bangalter.<ref name="MTVeInterview">[http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=40 "Daft Punk Embark On A Voyage of Discovery"] MTVe.com. Retrieved on February 22, 2007.</ref> The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, "On 'Digital Love' you get this [[Supertramp]] vibe on the bridge," which was generated through an in-studio [[Wurlitzer]] piano.<ref name="mixonlineinterview">Bryan Reesman, [http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_daft_punk/ Daft Punk interview] mixonline.com. Retrieved on March 6, 2007.</ref> During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that "we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs."<ref name="MiamiHerald" />

==Visual components==
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Umasked_but_blurred.JPG|left|thumb|170px|Daft Punk unmasked, but faces blurred]] -->
Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The [[music video]]s for their singles from ''Homework'' featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album ''Discovery'' subsequently became the soundtrack to ''Interstella 5555''.

Their outward personae have also changed over time. During their ''Homework'' years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance.<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997"/> When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in ''[[Director's Label#Volume 3: The Work Of Director Michel Gondry|The Work of Director Michel Gondry]]'' DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the ''Homework'' liner notes.

In their more visible ''Discovery'' years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various [[light-emitting diode|LED]] effects and metallic finger gloves.<ref name="Disc liner">Liner notes of the ''Discovery'' album - "Bionics Engineering by Tony Gardner & Alterian"</ref> Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Toonami]] block.<ref name="ToonamiDaft">[http://www.toonamiarsenal.com/download/toonami.php Toonami: Digital Arsenal] toonamiarsenal.com Retrieved on April 14, 2007.</ref> Thomas Bangalter once stated, "We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots."<ref name="ROBOPOP"/>

During a [http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=8943495939887017057 video interview] shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. "But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower."<ref name="Mixmag 2006">Suzanne Ely, "Return of the Cybermen" ''Mixmag'', July 2006, pp. 94-98.</ref> When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of [[glam rock|glam]], where it's definitely not you."<ref name="Mixmag 2006" /> With the release of ''Human After All'', the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather [[jumpsuit]]s and simplified versions of the ''Discovery'' head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by [[Hedi Slimane]].<ref name="Mixmag 2006" />
[[Image:Daftpunkkastljos.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Daft Punk during an interview on [[Sj<U+00F3>nvarpi<U+00F0>]]]]

During the filming and promotion of ''Daft Punk's Electroma'', the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.<ref>[http://www.twitchfilm.net/archives/007781.html Daft Punk Talk Electroma. While Wearing Bags On Their Heads.] twitchfilm.net. Retrieved on March 6, 2007.</ref>

It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity.<ref name="Mixmag 2006" /> The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] and the leather jacket worn by [[Iggy Pop]].<ref name="Paper"/> Bangalter stated, "The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it."<ref name="Paper">[http://www.papermag.com/?section=article&parid=2297&page=4 Daft Punk and the Rise of the Parisian Nightlife] ''Paper Magazine''.

They were known for incorporating various styles of music into their [[Disc jockey|DJ]] sets.

In the fall of 1997 they did their ''Daftendirektour'' to promote ''Homework'' in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage.<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997"/> As Bangalter stated, "Everything was synched up <U+2014> the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to."<ref name="ROBOPOP" /> May 25, 1997 saw them perform at the [[Tribal Gathering]] festival at [[Luton Hoo]], England, headlining with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Kraftwerk]].<ref>[http://www.physicsroom.org.nz/2cents/kraftwerk.htm 2 Cents: Kraftwerk, Tribal Gathering] (May 25, 1997).
