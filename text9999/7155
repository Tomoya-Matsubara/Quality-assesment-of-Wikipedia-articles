'''HMS ''Badger''''' was a Dutch [[Hoy (boat)|hoy]], one of some 19 that the Admiralty purchased for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1794 after France's declaration of war in 1793. The intent was to create quickly a class of gun-vessels for operations in coastal and shallow waters. Of all the hoys, she had probably the most distinguished career in that she helped fend off two French attacks on the [[<U+00CE>les Saint-Marcouf]], and participated in the capture of several French vessels. She was sold in 1802.

==Career==
''Badger'' was fitted out at Deptford between April and 25 May 1794, with Lieutenant Lewis Mortlock commissioning her in April.
In 1795 Captain [[William Sidney Smith|Sir Sidney Smith]] seized the uninhabited <U+00CE>les Saint-Marcouf, which lie {{convert|3.5|nmi|km}} off [[Ravenoville]] on the [[Cotentin peninsula]] in [[Normandy]].<ref name="RW102">Woodman (2001), p. 102</ref> Smith constructed barracks and gun batteries and manned the islands with 500&nbsp;sailors and [[Royal Marines]], including a large proportion of men unfit for ship-board service, described as "invalids".<ref name=James>James (1827), pp.113-7.</ref> Smith supported the islands with several gunvessels, including ''Badger'', {{HMS|Hawke|1794|2}}, and {{HMS|Shark|1794|2}}, and the [[floating battery]] {{HMS|Sandfly|1794|2}}. Lieutenant Charles Papps Price assumed command of ''Badger'' in August 1795, with Mortlock moving to command of the newly-catured and commissioned [[French gun-brig Crachefeu (1794)|''Crachefeu'']]. For administrative purposes, the Navy rated ''Badger'' a [[sloop-of-war]], and technically gave Price command of both the Saint-Marcouf islands.

Price was  an unpopular officer who had repeatedly been passed over for promotion. He apparently spent most of his time on the islands with a prostitute he had brought from [[Portsmouth]].<ref name="RW103">Woodman (2001), p. 103.</ref>

On 7 September 1795 the French mounted an attack with 17 large boats filled with men. They retreated in confusion after coming under fire from the redoubts the British had erected on East Island and from the gunvessels,<ref>Barrow (1848),Vol. 1, p.175.</ref> among them the hoys ''Badger'', {{HMS|Serpent|1794|2}} and ''Hawk'', and ''Sandfly''.

On 28 December 1796, ''Badger'' and ''Sandfly'' captured the ''Rebekah''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15114|startpage=231|date=9 March 1799}}</ref> Next year, on 21 February 1797, ''Badger'', ''Sandfly'', and the [[hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[cutter (boat)|cutters]] ''Champion'' and ''Fly'' captured the ''Souris''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=999 |issue=14057|date=17 October 1797}}</ref> ''Souris'' was a [[chasse-maree]] of 16 guns.<ref>''United service magazine'', No. 10, 1829, p.520.</ref> Unlike her sister-ship [[French gun-vessel Eclair (1793)|''Eclair'']], which the British had captured in 1795, the Royal Navy did not take her into service.{{#tag:ref|''Souris'', was built in 1785 in southern Brittany assist in harbour construction at Cherbourg. Between October 1793 and January 1794, the French Navy converted her into a gun-vessel, originally of three 18 or 24-pounder guns, and commissioned her in February.<ref>Winfield and Roberts (2015 forthcoming), Chap. 9.</ref>|group=Note}}  

Near the end of the year, on 12 November 1797, ''Badger'' and ''Sandfly'' captured the French vessels ''Eole'' and the ''Solide Michael''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=324|issue=15008|date=17 April 1798}}</ref> One week later ''Badger'' captured the ''Morgonstern''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=698|issue=15268|date=17 June 1800}}</ref>

On the night of 6 May 1798 the French approached the islands with a large number of armed, troop-carrying barges and some brigs to provide covering fire, as well as 5-6,000 troops. They then launched their attack at dawn. The West Island's batteries, under Lieutenant Price, were ready and inflicted devastating damage on the light invasion craft.<ref name=LG15014/> Despite severe casualties the French barges continued their approach until they were within [[musket]] range, {{convert|50|yd|m}}. The garrison of Royal Marines opened fire and the artillery crews switched to [[canister shot]]. Six or seven boats sank with their entire crews and troops, and others were heavily damaged.<ref name=LG15014/><ref name="RG107">Gardiner, p. 107.</ref>  Losses were so high that the French called off the attack; even so, the return journey carried the barges past East Island, which was under the command of Lieutenant Richard Bourne of ''Sandfly'' and mounted a battery that inflicted additional severe losses.<ref name=LG15014>{{London Gazette|startpage=389|endpage=391|issue=15014|date=8 May 1798}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although a number of records report that the British captured the gunvessel ''Flibustier'',<ref name=Winfield/> the letters from the action make no mention of this.<ref name=LG15014/> Wells's history of the battle, the most thorough account, also makes no mention of this.|group=Note}}

{{main|Battle of the <U+00CE>les Saint-Marcouf}}

British casualties were light. For his efforts, Price received promotion to Commander.<ref name=Winfield/> Nearly five decades later the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Isles St. Marcou" upon application to the three still-living British claimants from the battle.

On 18 July 1799, ''Badger'' captured four French vessels: the ''Pierre de Issigny'', ''Fortunee'', ''St. Pierre de Grandcamp'', and ''Amitie''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=289|issue=15241|date=22 March 1800}}</ref> What was ''Badger{{'}}''s last capture occurred on  15 September 1800 when Price sighted a French long cutter some four miles off the West Island. He sent Lieutenant M'Cullen of the [[Royal Marines]] with 24 picked men in ''Badger{{'}}''s ten-oared galley and six-oared cutter to catch the French vessel. He also signaled the gun-brig {{HMS|Sparkler|1797|2}} to provide covering fire. ''Sparkler'' drew the fire of two batteries, one of two 24-pounder guns and one of two 12-pounder guns while the boats went in to cut out the French vessel. The French crew ran their boat on shore and cut her masts and rigging. Nevertheless, the British towed her off, and despite heavy small-arms fire from the shore. The prize was the privateer row boat ''Victoire'', mounting four [[swivel gun]]s, 26 oars, and having a crew of at least 40 men, under the command of Captain Barier. Price described her as "quite new... the completest Boat for the Service of the Islands that possibly could be constructed." The only British casualty was ''Badger{{'}}''s gunners mate, who took a musket ball to the shoulder.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1062|endpage=1063|issue=15294|date=16 September 1800}}</ref>

==Fate==
''Badger'' was paid off in May 1802 and was sold later that year.<ref name=Winfield/>
