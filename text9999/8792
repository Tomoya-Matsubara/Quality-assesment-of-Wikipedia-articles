'''Oswald the Lucky Rabbit''' (also known as '''Oswald the Rabbit''' or '''Oswald Rabbit''') is an [[anthropomorphic]] [[rabbit]] and [[animated cartoon]] character created by [[Ub Iwerks]] and [[Walt Disney]] for films distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in the 1920s and 1930s. The majority rights to the character are currently held by [[The Walt Disney Company]], with exceptions of Winkler and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons starred Oswald who are owned by Universal. 

==Creation under Disney==
Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was introduced in 1927 after Disney's series of [[Alice Comedies]] had run its course. Disney signed a new contract with [[Universal Studios]] head [[Carl Laemmle]] where he would produce a series of cartoons for [[Charles Mintz]] and [[George Winkler]]. The first Oswald cartoon, ''[[Poor Papa]]'', was rejected by the Universal studio heads due to poor production quality and the sloppiness and age of Oswald. After this, Disney, together with [[Ub Iwerks]], created a second cartoon called ''[[Trolley Troubles]]'' featuring a much younger, neater Oswald. The short officially launched the series and proved to be Disney's greatest success yet. ''Poor Papa'' was finally released a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1928/poorpapa.html|title=''Poor Papa'' at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts|accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref>

A few of Oswald's adventures dealt with humor related to the procreative abilities of his species, as illustrated in the episode description of ''Poor Papa'': "Oswald gets a visit from the stork... again and again and again. He has to resort to a variety of strategies to stop the continual flow of his 420 babies." ''Trolley Troubles'' also showed Oswald surrounded by numerous baby rabbits, this time heckling him while on the job. Other cartoons, however, generally placed Oswald in more human-type conditions and situations.

In spring 1928, with the series going strong, Disney asked Mintz for an increase in the budget. But Mintz instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent budget cut, and as leverage, he reminded Disney that Mintz owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney's current employees to his new contract: Iwerks and [[Les Clark]] were among the few who remained loyal to Walt. Disney refused Mintz's demand, disassociating himself from Oswald after the series' first season. While finishing the remaining Oswald cartoons, Disney, Iwerks and Clark created the cartoon hero who would become [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s lasting symbol: [[Mickey Mouse]] (a slightly altered Oswald the Rabbit to avoid litigation), the most famous of Walt Disney's characters.

==Universal takes direct control==
Mintz, meanwhile, opened his own studio consisting primarily of former Disney employees, where he continued to produce Oswald cartoons, among them the first Oswald with sound, ''Hen Fruit'' (1929). Laemmle was dissatisfied with Mintz, and terminated his contract and opted to have the Oswald cartoons produced right on the Universal lot instead. By a coincidence, Disney and Mintz each produced nine cartoons the first year and 17 the next before Oswald was taken over by others. Laemmle selected [[Walter Lantz]] to produce the new series of Oswald shorts (the first of which was 1929's ''[[Race Riot]]''). Lantz consulted Disney about Oswald and he gave Lantz his blessing to continue the Oswald series as the Mickey Mouse shorts had become more successful so the two became close friends.<ref>http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/wade_sampson/print/1279.aspx</ref>

Over the next decade, Lantz would produce 142 Oswald cartoons, making for a grand total of 194 films that the character starred in, spanning the work of all three producers. After Lantz took over production in 1929, the character's look was changed to some degree over the following years: Oswald got white gloves on his hands, shoes on his feet, a shirt, a "cuter" face with larger eyes, a bigger head, and shorter ears. With 1935's ''Case of the Lost Sheep'', an even more major makeover took place: the character was drawn more realistically now, and with white fur rather than black. This new Oswald model was adapted directly from a non-Oswald bunny in another Lantz cartoon: the two-strip [[Technicolor]] ''Fox and the Rabbit'' (1935), released some two months earlier as the last of the early Cartune Classics series. 

The cartoons containing the new, white-furred Oswald seemed to be different from their predecessors in more than one way, as the stories themselves became softer. Minor changes in the drawing style would continue, too. With ''Happy Scouts'' (1938), the second-to-last Oswald film produced, the rabbit's fur went from being all-white to a combination of white and gray.

Unlike the Disney shorts, in which Oswald did not speak, Lantz's cartoons began to feature actual dialogue for Oswald, although most of the cartoons were still silent to begin with. Animator [[Bill Nolan (animator)|Bill Nolan]] did the voice of Oswald in ''Cold Turkey'', the first Lantz cartoon with dialogue, and the following year [[Pinto Colvig]], who was working as an animator and gag man at the studio, started voicing Oswald. When Colvig left the studio in 1931, [[Mickey Rooney]] took over the voicing of Oswald until early in the following year. Starting in 1932, Lantz ceased to use a regular voice actor for Oswald, and many studio staff members (including Lantz himself) would take turns in voicing the character over the years. [[June Foray]] provided Oswald's voice in ''The Egg Cracker Suite'', which was the final theatrical short to feature the character.

Oswald made a cameo appearance in the first animated sequence with both sound and color (two-strip Technicolor), a 2<U+00BD> minute animated sequence of the live action movie ''[[The King of Jazz]]'' (1930), produced by Laemmle for Universal. However, it was not until 1934 that Oswald got his own color sound cartoons in two-strip Technicolor, ''Toyland Premiere'' and ''Springtime Serenade''. The Oswald cartoons then returned to black-and-white, except for the last one, ''The Egg Cracker Suite'' (1943), released as a part of the Swing Symphonies series. ''Egg Cracker'' was also the only Oswald cartoon to use three-strip Technicolor. But before he was permanently retired, Oswald made a final [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] in ''[[The Woody Woodpecker Polka]]'' (1951), also in three-strip Technicolor, which by then had become the rule in the cartoon industry.

==Return to Disney ownership: the Al Michaels trade==
In February 2006, a number of minor assets including the rights to Oswald were acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company]] from [[NBC Universal]] as part of a deal that sent sportscaster [[Al Michaels]] from Disney's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[ESPN]] to [[NBC Sports]]. At the time, ABC had lost its contract for [[National Football League|NFL]] broadcast rights, and despite recently signing a long-term contract with ESPN, Michaels was interested in rejoining broadcast partner [[John Madden (football)|John Madden]] at NBC for the Sunday night package. Universal transferred the copyright in a cartoon character to Disney, and in exchange, Disney released Michaels from his employment contract, allowing him to sign with [[NBC]].

The deal includes the rights to the character and the original 26 short films made by Disney (namely, most of the Oswald films produced from 1927 to 1928). Rights to the Lantz/Universal-produced Oswald films and other related products were not included, and therefore Oswald appears in both Disney releases and in Universal's ''Woody Woodpecker and Friends'' collection.

Walt Disney's daughter, [[Diane Disney Miller]], issued the following statement after the deal was announced:

{{Cquote|When [[Bob Iger|Bob [Iger]]] was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], he told me he wanted to bring Oswald back to Disney, and I appreciate that he is a man of his word. Having Oswald around again is going to be a lot of fun.<ref name=WD>[http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2006/2006_0209_oswald.html Walt Disney's 1927 Animated Star Returns to Disney], a February 2006 press release</ref>}}

Around the same time, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[New York Jets]] made a similar deal, the Chiefs giving the Jets a draft pick as compensation for releasing coach [[Herm Edwards]] from his contract. Referring to this trade, Michaels said:

{{Cquote|Oswald is definitely worth more than a fourth-round draft choice. I'm going to be a [[trivia]] answer someday.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2324417 ESPN <U+2013> Stay 'tooned: Disney gets Oswald for Al Michaels]</ref>}}

In January 2007, a [[T-shirt]] line from Comme de Gar<U+00E7>on seems to have constituted the first new Disney Oswald merchandise. Following in [[December 2007|December]] was a two-disc [[DVD]] set, ''The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit'', included in [[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Seven|Wave Seven]] of the ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]'' series. Several Oswald collectors' figurines and a stuffed animal appeared shortly after the DVD set's release.  [[The Disney Store]] has also begun to introduce Oswald into its merchandise lines, including a canvas print and Christmas ornament that became available [[Autumn|Fall]] 2007.

==Theme park appearances==
Though the character Oswald showed up at the parks in [[Florida]] and [[California]] on the day Disney reacquired him, Oswald is not currently a character in the parks to meet and greet, like so many others are. Disney officials stated that he probably would be someday; they did not want to just haphazardly add him. When the character's future is determined, they are planning a big splash.<ref name=WD>[http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2006/2006_0209_oswald.html The Walt Disney Company and Affiliated Companies - Corporate Press Releases - February 09, 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2010, [[Tokyo Disneyland]] produced a float featuring Oswald for their first Easter holiday event.<ref name=OswaldFloat>[http://dalia1784.deviantart.com/art/Oswald-Float-160166894 Oswald Float photograph on deviantART]</ref>

==Oswald's career in comics==
Oswald made his first comic book appearance in 1935, when [[DC Comics]] featured him in the series ''New Fun'' (later ''More Fun''). His adventures, drawn by Al Stahl, were serialized one page to an issue for the magazine's first year, after which they ceased. The original black-furred version of Oswald was featured, even though Oswald was by this time a white rabbit on screen.

Oswald's second run in the comics began in 1942, when a new Oswald feature was initiated in [[Dell Comics]]' ''New Funnies'', this time modeled after the latest cartoon version of Oswald and influenced by the drawing style of other Lantz comic book characters at the time. Following the typical development seen in most new comics, the New Funnies stories slowly morphed the character in their own direction. 

At the start of the ''New Funnies'' feature, Oswald existed in a milieu reminiscent of [[Winnie the Pooh]]: he was portrayed as a live stuffed animal, living in a forest together with other anthropomorphized toys. These included Toby Bear, Maggie Lou the wooden doll, Hi-Yah Wahoo the turtle-faced Indian, and [[Woody Woodpecker]]<U+2014>depicted as a mechanical doll filled with nuts and bolts (hence his "nutty" behavior). In 1944, with the addition of writer [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]], the stuffed animal motif was dropped, as were Maggie Lou, Woody, and Wahoo. Oswald and Toby became flesh and blood characters living as roommates in "Lantzville". Initially drawn by Dan Gormley, the series was later drawn by the likes of Dan Noonan and Lloyd White.

In 1948, Toby adopted two orphan rabbits for Oswald to raise. Floyd and Lloyd, "Poppa Oswald's" new sons, stuck around; Toby was relegated to the sidelines, disappearing for good in 1953. Later stories focused on Oswald adventuring with his sons, seeking odd jobs, or simply protecting the boys from the likes of rabbit-eating Reddy Fox and (from 1961) con man Gabby Gator<U+2014>a character adapted from contemporary Woody Woodpecker cartoon shorts. This era of Oswald comics typically featured the art of [[Jack Bradbury]], known also for his Mickey Mouse work.

Post-1960s Oswald comics tended to be produced outside the United States, for example in [[Mexico]] and [[Italy]]. Through the end of the 20th century, the foreign comics carried on the look and story style of the Dell Oswald stories. More recently, they featured a "retro" attempt at recreating the original Disney Oswald.

A 1995 ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'' comic story in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' ("Temple of Doom" in the March and April 1995 issues) had Bonkers and Lucky Piquel, in their quest to save the fabled Toonstone, meet its keeper, Nimrod the Rabbit. This character is designed looking very similar to Oswald, and also resembles how Oswald would have looked if he had gone through a redesign similar to that of Mickey's. Especially with adding pupils in the black dot eye, the same with Mickey Mouse when ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'' was made in the late 1930s.<ref>http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii237/FroggoFan64/Disney%20Pictures/OswaldLookalike.jpg</ref>

It has been confirmed that Oswald will be the star in the comic ''Epic Mickey: Tales of the Wasteland'', a prequel to the game telling about what the Wasteland was like before Mickey.

==2004 Oswald toy craze in Japan==
Not long before Disney reacquired Oswald, Universal was marketing the character actively overseas. In 2004 and 2005, Oswald products were popular in [[Japan]], and were primarily made available as prizes in [[claw vending machine|UFO catchers]]. Typically manufactured by [[Taito]] and/or [[Medicom]], these products included [[puppet]]s, inflatable dolls, [[keyring]]s, and [[watch]]es. They were generally based on a navy-blue version of the original Disney/Iwerks character.<ref>[http://www.cartoonresearch.com/lantz2.html Cartoon Research: Oswald Rabbit toys]</ref>

A parody of Oswald has appeared in the manga 'Billy Bat' by Naoki Urasawa. He is used to represent Lee Harvey Oswald, JFKs assassin.

==2010 ''Epic Mickey'' appearance==
Oswald plays the role of one of the central protagonists, as well as the older half-brother of [[Mickey Mouse]], in the [[Wii]] video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', which was released in 2010. The game was developed by [[Warren Spector]], and features a dark atmosphere and a [[platform game|platform]]-[[Console RPG|RPG]] gameplay.  In this story, sorcerer [[Yen Sid]] has crafted a world for Disney's forgotten creations called the Cartoon Wasteland, in the form of a small model. After being replaced by Mickey, Oswald becomes the first resident and takes the world as his own. He presents himself as king of the Cartoon Wasteland and works to make it comfortable for other retired characters as they join him over time, but grows resentful of Mickey due to his growing popularity. Later on, [[Mickey Mouse]] stumbles into Yen Sid's home, fiddles with the model of the Cartoon Wasteland, and accidentally creates the [[Phantom Blot|Shadow Blot]], who, despite the efforts of its residents, proceeds to take over the Cartoon Wasteland, forcing Oswald into hiding. Years later, after forgetting his previous transgression, Mickey is pulled into the Cartoon Wasteland. There he must regain the trust of his resentful half-brother, Oswald, and get him to help Mickey stop the Shadow Blot and save the forgotten world. Developer Warren Spector comments on Oswald: "All he really wants is to be loved by Walt Disney." 

Although he doesn't have a spoken script, Oswald is voiced by [[Frank Welker]].
