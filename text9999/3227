The '''Ny-<U+00C5>lesund Town and Mine Museum''' ({{lang-no|Ny-<U+00C5>lesund By- og Gruvemuseum}}) is a museum located in [[Ny-<U+00C5>lesund]], a town on [[Spitsbergen]], the central island of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] archipelago [[Svalbard]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. While some sources claim that the more well known [[Svalbard Museum]] holds the position,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hagevik |first=Ellen Marie |date=1994 |title=Svalbard Museum: the world's northernmost museum |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=97972&set=52C72025_3_72&gp=0&lin=1&ll=a |journal=[[Museum International]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |volume=XLVI |issue=2 |pages=37<U+2013>40 |accessdate=20 November 2014 }}</ref> the museum is the [[List of northernmost items|world's northernmost]] such by virtue of Ny-<U+00C5>lesund's position to the far north of the regional capital [[Longyearbyen]].

Formerly a coal mining settlement until a series of serious accidents (including a final one in 1962) closed won the mine, Ny-<U+00C5>lesund <U+2013> which dates back to the first decades of the 20th century <U+2013> has been an centre of international Arctic and polar research in recent years, housing scientific bases such as the [[Arctic Yellow River Station]] and the [[Himadri Station]], belonging to [[China]] and [[India]] respectively.

The museum is housed in a building constructed in 1917, originally for storage. It was eventually converted into the town store in 1920. The museum was created long afterwards, in 1988, and the building has remained in use as such since. The exterior of the wooden structure has been largely preserved, due to its cultural heritage values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturminnesok.no/Lokaliteter/Svalbard/Ny-AAlesund-arealplanomraade/Museet-Butikken |title=Museet (Butikken) |language=Norwegian |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 July 2013 |website=http://www.kulturminnesok.no/ |publisher=[[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]] |accessdate=20 November 2014 }}</ref> The interior has gone through several redevelopments and improvements.
