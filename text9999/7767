'''Albert Snider''' (Not found - March 5, 1948) was an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] [[jockey]].

Al Snider rode at [[Keeneland Race Course]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] and [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[Arlington Park]] in 1940 and 1941. Among his significant wins were the [[Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes]] and the [[Stars and Stripes Breeders' Cup Turf Handicap|Stars and Stripes Handicap]]. In his best finish in an [[American Classic Races|American Classic]], Snider rode owner [[Fred W. Hooper|Fred W. Hooper's]] colt [[Hoop Jr.]] to second place in the 1945 [[Belmont Stakes]].

Signed on to ride for [[Calumet Farm]], Al Snider was made the jockey for future United States' [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Racing Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Citation (horse)|Citation]]. In 1947, he rode the colt in his two-year-old season, notably winning the [[Belmont Futurity Stakes]] en route to Citation being voted the [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse|U.S. Champion 2-Year-Old Colt]]. That year Snider also won the [[Pimlico Special]] aboard Calumet<U+2019>s colt, [[Fervent (horse)|Fervent]]. 

1948 promised to be a great year as Al Snider prepared to ride Citation in the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United States Triple Crowns|U.S. Triple Crown]] series. At [[Hialeah Park Race Track]], he rode the colt to victory in the 1948 [[Seminole Handicap|Seminole]] and [[Everglades Stakes|Everglades Handicap]]s. Then, after winning the [[Flamingo Stakes]], on March 5 Snider used a day off to go [[fishing]] in the [[Florida Keys]]. While out on the water, a sudden [[storm]] came up and Al Snider apparently drowned. A search party found no trace of his body but reportedly found his [[skiff]] eight days later on an island 10 miles south of [[Everglades, Florida|Everglades City]].

Calumet Farms head trainer [[Ben A. Jones|Ben Jones]] hired [[Eddie Arcaro]] to replace Snider on Citation and they won the [[Kentucky Derby]], [[Preakness Stakes]], and [[Belmont Stakes]], making him only the eighth horse in history to win the U.S. Triple Crown. Winning jockey Arcaro, one of Snider's friends, gave Snider's [[widow]] a share of his Kentucky Derby [[Purse distribution|purse money]].
