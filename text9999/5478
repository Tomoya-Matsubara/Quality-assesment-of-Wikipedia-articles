'''''Amanita muscaria''''', commonly known as the '''fly agaric''' or '''fly Amanita''', is a poisonous and [[psychoactive]] [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]], one of many in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. Native throughout the [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] regions of the Northern Hemisphere, ''Amanita muscaria'' has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a [[symbiont]] with pine plantations, and is now a true [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species. It [[mycorrhiza|associates]] with various deciduous and coniferous trees. The quintessential [[toadstool]], it is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually deep red mushroom, one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture. Several subspecies, with differing cap colour have been recognised to date, including the brown ''regalis'' (considered a separate species), the yellow-orange ''flavivolata'', ''guessowii'', and ''formosa'', and the pinkish ''persicina''. Genetic studies published in 2006 and 2008 show several sharply delineated clades which may represent separate species.

Although generally considered poisonous, it has been consumed as a food in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America after parboiling in plentiful water. However, ''Amanita muscaria'' is now primarily famed for its [[hallucinogenic]] properties with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound [[muscimol]]. It was used as an intoxicant and [[entheogen]] by the [[peoples of Siberia]] and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant existed beyond Siberia, however, such traditions are far less well-documented. The American banker and amateur ethnomycologist [[R. Gordon Wasson]] proposed the fly agaric was in fact the [[Soma]] talked about in the ancient [[Rig Veda]] texts of India; although this theory has been refuted by anthropologists, it gained common credence when first published in 1968.

The common name in English is thought to have been derived from its European use as an [[insecticide]], when sprinkled in milk.<ref>{{cite book|author=Atkinson GF.|title=Studies of American fungi.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The name of the mushroom in many European languages is derived from the fact that it was used as an [[insecticide]], when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from [[Germanic languages|Germanic-]] <!--(bar England)--> and [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking]] parts of Europe, as well as the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 198.</ref> [[Albertus Magnus]] was the first to record it in his work ''De vegetabilibus'' sometime before 1256,<ref>{{cite book |title=De vegetabilibus |author=Magnus A.|authorlink=Albertus Magnus |year=1256|chapter=Book II, Chapter 6; p 87 and Book VI, Chapter 7; p 345|publisher= |location= }}</ref> commenting:

("It is called the mushroom of flies, because crushed in milk it kills flies")<ref name = "Ramsbottom44">Ramsbottom, p 44.</ref>}}

The 16th century Flemish botanist [[Carolus Clusius]] traced the practice to [[Frankfurt]] in Germany,<ref>{{cite book |title=Rariorum plantarum historia |author=Clusius C.|authorlink=Carolus Clusius |year=1601|chapter=Genus XII of the pernicious mushrooms |publisher= |location= }}</ref> while [[Carl Linnaeus]], the "father of taxonomy", reported it from [[Sm<U+00E5>land]] in southern Sweden where he had lived as a child.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | author =Linnaeus C.| authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Flora svecica [suecica] exhibens plantas per regnum Sueciae crescentes systematice cum differentiis specierum, synonymis autorum, nominibus incolarum, solo locorum, usu pharmacop<U+00E6>orum| publisher=Holmiae.

The starting date had been formerly set as January 1 1821, the date of the works of the "father of mycology", Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], and under these conditions, the full name was ''Amanita muscaria'' (L.:Fr.) [[William Jackson Hooker|Hook.]]. However, a recent revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] in 1987 changed the rules regarding the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and now names can be considered valid as far back as May 1 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's seminal work.<ref>{{cite book | author = Esser K|coauthors=Lemke PA. | title = The Mycota: a comprehensive treatise on fungi as experimental systems for basic and applied research | publisher = Springer | date= 1994| page = 181| isbn = 3540664939}}</ref> Hence, Linnaeus and Lamarck became the namers of the ''Amanita muscaria'' (L.) Lam.

English mycologist [[John Ramsbottom (mycologist)|John Ramsbottom]] reported that ''Amanita muscaria'' was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and ''bug agaric'' was an old alternate name.<ref name = "Ramsbottom44"/> French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran<U+00E7>ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] tried to replicate its fly-killing properties without success in his work ''Histoire des plantes v<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>neuses et suspectes de la France'', and proposed a new binomial name ''Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus'' because of this.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 200.</ref> One compound isolated from the fungus is 1,3-diolein, which is in fact an insect attractor.<ref name = "Bnejamin95"/>

An alternative derivation proposes that the term ''fly-'' refers not to insects as such but rather the [[delirium]] resulting from consumption of the [[fungus]]. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person's head and cause mental illness.<ref name = "Michelot03"/> Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning either "mad-" or "fool's" ''Amanita caesarea''. Hence there is ''oriol foll'' "mad oriol" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''mujolo folo'' from [[Toulouse]], ''concourlo fouolo'' from the [[Aveyron]] department in Southern France, ''ovolo matto'' from the [[Province of Trento]] in Italy. A local dialect name in [[Fribourg]] in Switzerland is ''tsapi de diablhou'', which translates as "Devil's hat".<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 194.</ref>

The word [[toadstool]] in English does not refer to any particular species, yet it has a more definite specific connotation with ''A. muscaria'' in continental Europe. Yet another name is ''crapaudin'' in many parts of France, and a [[Basque language|Basque]] term from [[Guip<U+00FA>zcoa]] and [[Biscay]] is ''amoroto'', all alluding to toads.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 187.</ref> The toad is thought to be associated with the mushroom because it symbolizes toxicity and [[chthonic]] forces in the same way that the [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] does.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 190.</ref> Wasson proposed this was due to its being a shamanic and also [[taboo]] object and hence unable to be named specifically in ancient Celtic culture.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 190<U+2013>91.</ref> He speculates that the power of this taboo may have perpetuated its maligned reputation while other lethal fungi such as the death cap (''[[Amanita phalloides|A. phalloides]]'') have had few cultural connotations throughout European history.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 192.</ref> In addition, a common name from China is ''ha-ma ch<U+00FC>n'', meaning "toad mushroom" ([[wikt:<U+86E4>|<U+86E4>]][[wikt:<U+87C6>|<U+87C6>]][[wikt:<U+83CC>|<U+83CC>]]), although the toad does not carry a negative connotation in Chinese culture and symbolism.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 189.</ref> An unusual derivation is the Japanese ''beni-tengu-take'' "long-nosed goblin-mushroom".<ref name = "Michelot03"/>

''Amanita muscaria'' varies considerably in its morphology and many authorities recognize a number of subspecies or varieties within the species. In ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', German mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] listed three subspecies, though without description: ''A. muscaria'' ssp. ''muscaria'', ''A. muscaria'' ssp. ''americana'', and ''A. muscaria'' ssp. ''flavivolvata''.<ref name=singer/>

Contemporary authorities recognize up to seven varieties:
* var. '''''muscaria''''', the typical red-and-white spotted variety. Some authorities, such as Rodham Tulloss, only use this name for Eurasian and western [[Alaskan]] populations.<ref name=jenkins/><ref name=tulloss1>{{cite web|url=http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/muscmusc.html|title= ''Amanita muscaria'' (L. : Fr.)

A 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of ''A. muscaria'' by mycologist J<U+00F3>zsef Geml and colleagues found three distinct [[clades]] within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian "subalpine", and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the center of diversification of this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of this species: var. ''alba'', var. ''flavivolvata'', var. ''formosa'' (including var. ''guessowii''), and var. ''regalis'' from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are simply [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] found throughout the species rather than distinct subspecies or varieties.<ref name = "Geml06">{{cite journal |author=Geml J|coauthors=Laursen GA; O'Neill K; Nusbaum HC; Taylor DL. |title=Beringian origins and cryptic speciation events in the fly agaric (''Amanita muscaria'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=225<U+2013>39 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16367842 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02799.x |url=http://users.iab.uaf.edu/~jozsef_geml/AmanitaME.pdf}}</ref> Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak<U+2013>hickory<U+2013>pine forest in the southeastern United States, and two more on Santa Cruz Island in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species; thus ''A. muscaria'' as it stands currently is a [[cryptic species complex|species complex]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geml J|coauthors=Tulloss RE; Laursen GA, ''et al.''|date=2008|title=Evidence for strong inter- and intracontinental phylogeographic structure in ''Amanita muscaria'', a wind-dispersed ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=48|issue=2|pages=694<U+2013>701|url=http://mercury.bio.uaf.edu/~lee_taylor/pdfs/Geml_Mol-Phylo-Evol_2008.pdf|accessdate=2009-20-28|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2008.04.029}}</ref> The complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa currently regarded as species:<ref name=tulloss1/> ''A. breckonii'' is a buff-capped mushroom associated with conifers from the Pacific Northwest,<ref name=tulloss6>{{cite web|url=http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/breckoni.html|title= ''Amanita breckonii'' Ammirati & Thiers|author=Tulloss, R.

== Description ==
[[File:Fly Agaric mushroom 04.jpg|thumb|left|A mature ''Amanita muscaria'' near [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], with a distinctive [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]]]
A large conspicuous [[mushroom]], ''Amanita muscaria'' is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with [[basidiocarp]]s in all stages of development.
Fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like a white egg, covered in the white warty material of the universal veil. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil which assists in identification. As the fungus grows, the red color appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from [[wikt:globose|globose]] to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L.|year=1976|title=Wild mushrooms: an illustrated handbook|publisher=Hertfordshire, UK: Garden City Press|isbn=0-584-10324-7}}</ref> Fully grown, the bright red [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is usually around 8&ndash;20&nbsp;cm (3&ndash;8&nbsp;in) in diameter, although larger specimens have been found. The red color may fade after rain and in older mushrooms. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the [[universal veil]], a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. The free [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, as is the [[spore print]]. The oval spores measure 9&ndash;13 by 6.5&ndash;9&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+03BC>m]], and are [[Amyloid (mycology)|non-amyloid]], that is, they do not turn blue with the application of [[Melzer's reagent|iodine]].<ref name="arora86"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white, 5&ndash;20&nbsp;cm high (2&ndash;8&nbsp;in) by 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm (0.4&ndash;0.8&nbsp;in) wide, and has the slightly brittle, fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms. At the base is a [[Volva (mycology)|bulb]] that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs. Between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the [[partial veil]] (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. It can be quite wide and flaccid with age. There is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.<ref name = "Ultimatemush">{{cite book | author = Jordan P|coauthors=Wheeler S.| year = 2001 | title = The ultimate mushroom book | publisher = Hermes House | isbn = 0831730803}}</ref><ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author= Phillips R.| year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=140}}</ref>

Although very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red species in the Americas, including ''[[Armillaria]]'' cf. ''mellea'' and the edible ''Amanita basii''&mdash;a Mexican species similar to ''[[Amanita caesarea|A. caesarea]]'' of Europe. Poison control centers in the U.S. and Canada are aware that ''amarill'' is a common name for ''A. caesarea''-like species in Mexico, not just the Spanish for 'yellow'.<ref name=tulloss3/> ''Amanita caesarea'' can be distinguished as it has an entire orange red cap, lacking the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore the stem, gills and ring are bright yellow, not white.<ref>{{cite book | author = Haas H.| year = 1969 | title = The young specialist Looks at fungi| publisher = Burke | isbn=0222794143|page=94}}</ref> Finally the volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales.<ref>{{cite book | author = Krieger LCC| year = 1967 | title = The mushroom handbook| publisher = Dover| isbn=0486218619}}</ref> In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native vermilion grisette (''[[Amanita xanthocephala]]''), which grows in association with [[eucalypts]].

== Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Amanita muscaria Cuenca.JPG|left|thumb|''A. muscaria'' in a pine woodland of ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]''.]]

''A. muscaria'' is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] regions of the Northern Hemisphere,<ref name = "Geml06"/> including high elevations of warmer latitudes in regions like the [[Hindu Kush]], the Mediterranean and Central America.

''Amanita muscaria'' poisoning typically occurs in either young children or people ingesting it for a hallucinogenic experience.<ref name = "Michelot03"/><ref name="Benjamin92"/><ref name="Hoegberg">{{cite journal |author=Hoegberg LC; Larsen L; Sonne L; Bang J; Skanning PG; |title=Three cases of ''Amanita muscaria'' ingestion in children: two severe courses [abstract]|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=407<U+2013>8 |year=2008 |month= |doi=10.1080/15563650802071703 |doi_brokendate=2009-02-22}}</ref> Occasionally, immature button forms have been mistaken for edible [[puffball]]s.<ref name="benjamin30304">Benjamin, ''Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas'', p 303<U+2013>04.</ref> Additionally, the white spots may be washed away during heavy rain and it can then appear similar to the edible ''[[Amanita caesarea|A. caesarea]]''.<ref name="Brvar06"/>

''Amanita muscaria'' contains a number of biologically active agents, at least two of which, [[muscimol]] and [[ibotenic acid]], are known to be [[psychoactive]]. A toxic dose in adults is approximately 6&nbsp;mg muscimol or 30 to 60&nbsp;mg ibotenic acid,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Theobald W|coauthors= B<U+00FC>ch O; Kunz HA; Krupp P; Stenger EG; Heimann H.|title=[Pharmacological and experimental psychological studies with 2 components of fly agaric (''Amanita muscaria'')] |language=German |journal=Arzneimittelforschung |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=311<U+2013>5 |year=1968 |month=March |pmid=5696006 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=chilton>{{cite journal |author=Chilton WS|title=The course of an intentional poisoning|journal=MacIlvanea |volume=2 |issue= |pages=17 |year=1975 |month= |pmid=}}</ref> this is typically about the amount found in one cap of ''Amanita muscaria''.<ref name="Satora05"/> However, the amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which further confuses the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times as much ibotenic acid and muscimol compared to autumn fruitings.<ref name="Benjamin92"/> Ibotenic acid has shown to be highly [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] when injected directly into the brains of mice and rats.<ref name="Olpe78">{{cite journal |author=Olpe HR |coauthors= Koella WP |title=The action of muscimol on neurones of the substantia nigra of the rat |journal=Experientia |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=235 |year=1978 |month=February |pmid=564284 |doi=10.1007/BF01944700}}</ref>

[[File:Muscimol-lg.png|right|thumb|[[Muscimol]], a principal psychoactive agent in ''A. muscaria'']]
The major toxins involved in poisoning are [[muscimol]] (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an [[Unsaturated compound|unsaturated]] cyclic [[hydroxamic acid]]) and [[ibotenic acid]]. Muscimol is the product of the [[decarboxylation]] or drying of ibotenic acid.

Ibotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major [[neurotransmitter]]s of the central nervous system: [[glutamic acid]] and [[GABA]] respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] [[agonist]], while ibotenic acid is an agonist of [[NMDA receptor|NMDA glutamate receptors]] and certain [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]]s<ref>{{cite journal |author=J<U+00F8>rgensen, C.

===Symptoms===
Fly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight, effects can range from [[nausea]] and twitching to drowsiness, [[cholinergic crisis]]-like effects (low [[blood pressure]], [[sweat]]ing and [[saliva]]tion), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], relaxation, [[ataxia]], and [[Vertigo (medical)|loss of equilibrium]].<ref name="Benjamin92">{{cite journal|author=Benjamin DR.|date=1992|title=Mushroom poisoning in infants and children: the ''Amanita pantherina''/''muscaria'' group|journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=13<U+2013>22|doi=10.3109/15563659208994442|pmid=1347320}}</ref><ref name="Hoegberg"/><ref name="Satora05"/><ref name="Buck63">{{cite journal |author=Buck, R.

In cases of serious poisoning it causes a [[delirium]], similar in effect to [[anticholinergic]] poisoning it is characterized by bouts of marked [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of [[central nervous system]] depression.

===Treatment===
Medical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. Initial treatment consists of [[gastric]] decontamination. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, [[activated charcoal]] is given. [[Gastric lavage]] can be considered if the patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Vale, J.

==Psychoactive use==
Unlike the hallucinogenic mushrooms of the ''[[Psilocybe]]'', ''Amanita muscaria'' has been rarely consumed recreationally. However, following the outlawing of [[psilocybin]]-containing mushrooms in the United Kingdom, an increased quantity of legal ''A. muscaria'' mushrooms began to be sold and consumed.<ref>European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, p 17.</ref>

In eastern Siberia, the [[shamanism|shaman]] would consume the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine.<ref name=Wasson161>Wasson, ''Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 161.</ref> This urine, still containing active hallucinogens may actually be more potent than the ''A. muscaria'' mushrooms with fewer negative effects, such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.<ref name="Diaz">{{cite book|author=Diaz, J.|title=How Drugs Influence Behavior: A Neurobehavioral Approach|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|date=1996|isbn=0023287640 }}</ref> Among the Koryak, one report held the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 234<U+2013>35.</ref>

===Siberia===
''A. muscaria'' was widely used as a [[hallucinogenic drug]] by many of the indigenous [[peoples of Siberia]]. Its use was known among almost all of the [[Uralic]]-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the [[Paleosiberian]]-speaking peoples of the [[Russian Far East]]. However, there are only isolated reports of ''A. muscaria'' use among the [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Turkic peoples]] of central Siberia and it is believed that hallucinogenic use of ''A. muscaria'' was largely not a practice of these peoples.<ref name="nyberg1">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|date=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71<U+2013>80}}</ref> In western Siberia, the use of ''A. muscaria'' was restricted to [[shamans]], who used it as an alternate method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve a trance state by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, ''A. muscaria'' was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously.<ref name="nyberg1" />

The [[Koryaks|Koryak]] of eastern Siberia have a story about the fly agaric (''wapaq'') which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity ''Vahiyinin'' ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the ''wapaq'', and his saliva becomes the warts. After experiencing the power of the ''wapaq'', Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, can learn from it.<ref name = "Ramsbottom45">Ramsbottom, p 45.</ref>

===Other reports of entheogenic use===
Beyond Siberia, there are only isolated and unconfirmed reports of the hallucinogenic use of ''A. muscaria''. The Finnish historian [[T. I. Itkonen]] mentions that it was once used among the [[Sami people]], sorcerers in [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] would consume fly agarics with seven spots.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 279.</ref> In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and [[Hartmut Geerken]] published an article in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of recreational use of this mushroom among a [[Parachi]]-speaking group in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/amanitas/references/journal/1979_mochtar_afghanistan1.shtml|title=The Hallucinogens Muscarine and Ibotenic Acid in the Middle Hindu Kush: A contribution on traditional medicinal mycology in Afghanistan|author=Mochtar, S.

Gordon Wasson]]'s proposed that ''A. muscaria'' was the ''[[Soma]]'' talked about in the [[Rig Veda]] of [[India]],<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 10.</ref> which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time.<ref name=Letcher145>Letcher, p 145.</ref> He noted that descriptions of ''Soma'' omitted description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom,<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 18.</ref> and used the adjective ''h<U+00E1>ri'' "dazzling" or "flaming" which the author interprets as red.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 36<U+2013>37.</ref> One line described men urinating ''Soma''; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming "from the mountains", which Wasson interpreted as being brought with the Aryan invaders from the north.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 22<U+2013>24.</ref> However, Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy noted that both the eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed, using as a source the ''[[Manusm<U+1E5B>ti]]''.<ref name=Letcher146>Letcher, p 146.</ref>
In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory; he noted the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Brough, J.|title=Soma and ''Amanita muscaria''|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies (BSOAS)|volume=34|year=1971|pages=331<U+2013>62}}</ref>

===Vikings===
A single source for the notion that [[viking]]s used ''A. muscaria'' to produce their [[berserker]] rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel <U+00D6>dman in 1784.<ref>{{sv icon}} <U+00D6>dman S. (1784) F<U+00F6>rs<U+00F6>k at utur Naturens Historia f<U+00F6>rklara de nordiska gamla K<U+00E4>mpars Berserka-gang (An attempt to Explain the Berserk-raging of Ancient Nordic Warriors through Natural History). ''Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens nya Handlingar'' '''5''': 240<U+2013>247 (In: Wasson, 1968)</ref> <U+00D6>dman based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers.
Today, it is generally considered an urban legend or at best speculation that cannot be proven. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but could create a range of reactions within a range of people.<ref name=Hoff>{{cite book|last=Hoffer|first=A.|coauthors=Osmond, H.|authorlink=Abram Hoffer|title=The Hallucinogens|publisher=Academic Press|date=1967|pages=443-54|isbn=0-12-351850-4}}</ref> It is possible that it could make a person incredibly angry, as well as make them "very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright".<ref name=Hoff/>

===Christianity===
Biblical scholar [[John Marco Allegro]] controversially proposed that the Roman Theology was derived from a sex and psychedelic mushroom cult in his 1970 book ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'',<ref>
{{cite book | author = Allegro, J. | year = 1970 | title = The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Roman Theology within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East | publisher = Hodder and Stoughton | location = London| isbn = 0-340-12875-5}}</ref> although his theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of [[ethnomycology]]. The book was roundly discredited by academics and theologians, including [[Godfrey Rolles Driver|Sir Godfrey Driver]], Emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at [[Oxford University]], and [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], the Dean of [[Christ Church College, Oxford]].<ref>Letcher, p 160.</ref> Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book ''A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth''; he notes neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the middle east, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory was true, the use of the mushroom must have been "the best kept secret in the world" as it was so well concealed for all this time.<ref>{{cite book|author=King, J. C. |title=A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|date=1970|isbn=0-350-12597-7}}</ref><ref>Letcher, p 161.</ref>

In ''Magic Mushrooms in Religion and Alchemy'' (formerly called ''Strange Fruit'') Clark Heinrich interprets ''A. muscaria'' usage by [[Adam and Eve]], [[Moses]], [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]], [[Isaiah]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Jonah]], [[Jesus]] and his [[Apostle (Christian)|disciples]], and [[John of Patmos]].<ref>{{cite book| title = Magic Mushrooms in Religion and Alchemy| author= Heinrich, C.| publisher = Park Street Press| pages = 64<U+2013>134| isbn = 089281997-9| year = 2002}}</ref> In the book ''Apples of Apollo'' the mushroom is identified in a wide range of mythological tales such as those involving [[Perseus]], [[Prometheus]], [[Heracles]], [[Jason#The_Quest_for_the_Golden_Fleece|Jason and the Argonauts]], Jesus and the [[Holy Grail]].<ref>{{cite book| title = The Apples of Apollo| author = Ruck, Carl| authorlink = Carl Ruck| coauthors = [[Blaise Daniel Staples|Staples, B.

==Culinary use==
The toxins in ''A. muscaria'' are water soluble. When sliced thinly, or chopped into thin dice and boiled in plentiful water until thoroughly cooked, it seems to be detoxified.<ref name="RubArora">{{cite journal|author=Rubel, W.|coauthors=Arora, D.|date=2008|title=A Study of Cultural Bias in Field Guide Determinations of Mushroom Edibility Using the Iconic Mushroom, ''Amanita Muscaria,''as an Example|journal=Economic Botany|volume=62|issue=3|pages=223<U+2013>43}}</ref> Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified ''A. muscaria'' has been practiced in some localities in Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]] wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th Century, the French physician [[F<U+00E9>lix Archim<U+00E8>de Pouchet]] was a popularizer and advocate of ''A. muscaria'' consumption, comparing it to [[manioc]], an important food source in tropical South America that nevertheless must be detoxified before consumption.<ref name="RubArora"/>

Use of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America as well. A classic description of this use of ''A. muscaria'' by an [[African-American]] mushroom seller in Washington D.C. in the late nineteenth century is described by American botanist [[Frederick Vernon Coville]]. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar is made into a mushroom sauce for steak.<ref>Coville, F. V. 1898. ''Observations on Recent Cases of Mushroom Poisoning in the District of Columbia''. United States Department of Agriculture, Division of Botany. U. S. Government Printing office, Washington, D.C.</ref> It is also consumed as a food in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in [[Nagano Prefecture]], Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.<ref>{{cite paper|author = Phipps, A. G.|coauthors= Bennett, B.C.; Downum, K. R.| title = Japanese use of Beni-tengu-dake (''Amanita muscaria'') and the efficacy of traditional detoxification methods|publisher = Florida International University, Miami, Florida|date=2000}}</ref>

A 2008 paper by mycologist [[David Arora]] and food historian William Rubel gives a history of consumption of ''A. muscaria'' as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that ''Amanita muscaria'' be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of [[cultural bias]], as several other popular edible species, notably [[morels]], are toxic unless properly cooked.<ref name="RubArora"/>

===Literature===
The journeys of [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg|Philip von Strahlenberg]] to Siberia and his descriptions of the use of the ''mukhomor'' there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had imbibed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer [[Oliver Goldsmith]] in his widely-read 1762 novel ''Citizen of the World''.<ref>Letcher, p 122.</ref> The mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time.<ref>Letcher, p 123.</ref> Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] in his books ''The Seven Sisters of Sleep'' and ''A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi''.<ref>Letcher, p 125.</ref> This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.<ref>Letcher, p 126.</ref> A hallucinogenic "scarlet toadstool" from Lappland is also featured as a plot element in [[Charles Kingsley]]'s 1866 novel ''Hereward the Wake'' based on the [[Hereward the Wake|medieval figure]] of the same name;<ref>Letcher, p 127.</ref> fly agaric shamanism is explored more recently in the 2003 novel ''[[Thursbitch]]'' by [[Alan Garner]].<ref>Letcher, p 129.</ref>

===Christmas decorations and Santa Claus===
Fly agarics appear on [[Christmas cards]] and [[New Year]] cards from around the world as a symbol of good [[luck]].<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 204.</ref> The ethnobotanist [[Jonathan Ott]] has suggested that the idea of [[Santa Claus]] and tradition of hanging stockings over the fireplace is based centrally upon the fly agaric mushroom itself.<ref name="Ott76">{{cite book|last=Ott, J. |title=Hallucinogenic Plants of North America|publisher=Wingbow Press|location=Berkeley, CA|date=1976|isbn=0914728156}}</ref> With its generally red and white color scheme, he argues that Santa Claus's suit is related to the mushroom. He also draws parallels with flying reindeer: reindeer had been reported to consume the mushroom and prance around in an intoxicated manner afterwards.<ref>Wasson, ''Soma:Divine Mushroom of Immortality'', p 238.</ref> American ethnopharmacologist Scott Hajicek-Dobberstein, researching possible links between religious myths and the red mushroom, notes, "If Santa Claus had but one eye [like [[Odin]]], or if [[Amanita muscaria#Psychoactive use|magic urine]] had been a part of his legend, his connection to the ''Amanita muscaria'' would be much easier to believe."<ref name=siddhas>{{cite journal |author=Hajicek-Dobberstein, S. |title=Soma siddhas and alchemical enlightenment: psychedelic mushrooms in Buddhist tradition |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=99<U+2013>118 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=8583800 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(95)01292-L|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378-8741(95)01292-L}}</ref>

The connection was reported to a much wider audience with an article in the [[The Sunday Times Magazine|magazine]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 1980,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Taylor, R.|date=21 December 1980|title=Who is Santa Claus?|journal=Sunday Times Magazine|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|location=London|pages=13<U+2013>17}}</ref> and ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morgan, A.|date=December 1986|title=Who put the toad in toadstool?|journal=New Scientist|volume=25|pages=44<U+2013>47}}</ref> Historian Ronald Hutton has since ruled out the connection;<ref>{{cite book|author=Hutton, R.|title=The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|date=1996|pages=118<U+2013>19}}</ref> he noted reindeer spirits did not appear in Siberian mythology, shamans did not travel by sleigh, nor did they wear red and white, or climb out of smoke holes in [[yurt]] roofs. Finally, American awareness of Siberian shamanism postdated the appearance of much of the folklore around Santa.<ref>Letcher, p 139.</ref>
