The '''[[ship prefix|MS]] ''Louis Majesty''''' (formerly '''[[ship prefix|MS]] ''Norwegian Majesty''''') is a [[cruise ship]] owned and operated by [[Louis Cruise Lines]]. She was originally ordered by [[Birka Line]] as '''MS ''Birka Queen''''' from the [[W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4> Marine]] [[Turku Shipyard]] in [[Finland]], but completed by [[Kvaerner]] [[Masa-Yards]] as '''MS ''Royal Majesty''''' for [[Majesty Cruise Line]]. In 1997 she was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line and lengthened by {{convert|33.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at the [[Lloyd Werft]] shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]].<ref name=FoF /> Two passengers died when the ship was hit by a [[rogue wave]] in 2010.

==Concept and construction==

The ''Birka Queen'' was ordered by [[Birka Line]] for short cruises out of [[Stockholm]] as a running mate to {{MS|Birka Princess}}. The ship was ordered from [[W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4> Marine]],<ref name=FoF /> but the shipyard went bankrupt in 1990. Operations were soon reorganized under the name of [[Masa-Yards]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Siljan viisi vuosikymment<U+00E4> |last=Malmberg |first=Thure |coauthors=Stampehl, Marko |year=2007 |publisher=Frenckellin Kirjapaino Oy |location=Espoo |isbn=978-951-98405-7-4 |language=Finnish/English |pages=153<U+2013>154 }}</ref> but the price of the ship was increased in the process, and Birka therefore refused to take delivery. Instead, the build contact was sold to [[Majesty Cruise Line]], who took delivery of the ship on July 2, 1992, renaming her ''Royal Majesty''.<ref name=FoF />

==Service history==

{{Current|section|date=March 2010}}

Following delivery, the ''Royal Majesty'' set on her maiden voyage, a [[transatlantic]] crossing from [[Southampton]] to [[New York City]], on July 7, 1992. She was officially christened in New York City on July 21, 1992.<ref name=FoF /> She was christened by Liza Minelli. Following this, she was used on three- and four-night cruises out of [[Florida]]. In 1995 she initiated a new [[northern hemisphere]] summer season itenary with cruises from [[Boston]] to [[St. George's, Bermuda]], returning to Florida for the winter season. In September 1995 she participated in an expedition to the sinking site of {{RMS|Titanic}}, spending five days at the site with many survivors from the famous ship onboard, while parts of the ''Titanic'' were being salvaged.<ref name=Boyle>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/RoyalMajesty.html |title=''Royal Majesty'' |accessdate=2008-04-23 |date= |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Simplon Postcards |language= }}</ref>
[[Image:NCL Majesty Upper Deck.jpg|thumb|left|The upper deck of the ''Norwegian Majesty''.]]

On June 10, 1995, Royal Majesty grounded on Rose and Crown Shoal about 10 miles east of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, and about 17 miles from where the
watch officers thought the vessel was. The vessel, with 1,509 persons on board, was en route from St.
George<U+2019>s, Bermuda, to Boston, Massachusetts. There were no deaths or injuries as a result of this
accident. Damage to the vessel and lost revenue, however, were estimated at about $7 million. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Publictn/1997/MAR9701.pdf |title=NTSB Marine Accident Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/12/us/cruise-ship-carrying-1500-runs-aground.html |title=Cruise Ship Carrying 1,500 Runs Aground -NY Times}}</ref>

[[Majesty Cruise Line]] ceased operations at the end of the 1997 summer season, and the ''Royal Majesty'' was sold to [[Norwegian Cruise Line]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/MajestyCruiseLine.html |title=Majesty Cruise Line |accessdate=2008-04-23 |date= |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Simplon Postcards |language= }}</ref> She was renamed ''Norwegian Majesty'', and in 1999 she received a {{convert|33.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}} lengthening at the [[Lloyd Werft]] shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]].<ref name=FoF /> Similar lenghtenings had been carried out on NCL's ''[[Dreamward]]'' and ''[[Windward]]'' the previous year.<ref name=Boyle /> The lengthening of the Norwegian Majesty however was more technically complicated than those of the other ships, as she had not been designed for such an operation.<ref name=Ward />

In 2004 the ownership of the ''Norwegian Majesty'' was transferred to NCL's parent company [[Star Cruises]] in preparation for potential transfer to the Star Cruises fleet or sale at a later date. She remained in NCL service without other changes.<ref name=Newman /> On April 23, 2008 the ''Norwegian Majesty'', was sold to the [[Cyprus]]-based [[Louis Cruise Lines]]. Louis Cruise Lines had reportedly outbid [[International Shipping Partners]] with their offer of [[USD|$]]162 million.<ref name=CBR /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dougnewmanatsea.com/2008/04/18/seatrade-pride-of-america-not-sold/ |title=Seatrade: Pride of America Not Sold |accessdate=2008-04-19 |date=2008-04-18 |last=Newman |first=Doug  |work=At Sea with Doug Newman |publisher= }}</ref> The deal was completed on July 29, 2008, but the ''Norwegian Majesty'' will be chartered back to Norwegian Cruise Line until October 2009.<ref name=CBR /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/star-cruises-218m-norwegian-dream-sale-fails/20017575692.htm|title=Star Cruises $218m Norwegian Dream sale fails|last=Hand|first=Marcus|date=2008-09-30|publisher=''[[Lloyd's List]]''|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref>

On June 24, 2009, Louis revealed that the Norwegian Majesty would be renamed Louis Majesty.<ref>http://cruiseind.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/louis-majesty/</ref>

On 3 March 2010, three [[rogue waves]] hit the Louis Majesty, killing two passengers, and injuring a number of others, while on a 12 day cruise around the Mediterranean. The waves, which were reportedly in excess of {{convert|26|ft|m|0}} high, collided with the side of the vessel, smashing several windows in the saloon area. Water was taken on in the saloon area, which then drained down the decks below. The ship returned to port at [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]] to receive repairs.<ref name=BBC8458547>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8548547.stm |title=Two killed as giant waves hit Mediterranean cruise ship |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref>
