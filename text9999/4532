'''Ron Hughes''' (born ca. 1943) is the College Scouting Coordinator of the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].<ref name="CUP_HOF"/>

==Biography==
Hughes is a native of [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania]].  He was a standout [[American football |football]] and [[basketball]] player at [[Charleroi High School]].  He matriculated to nearby [[California University of Pennsylvania |California State College]] where he played [[Center (American football)|center]] and [[linebacker]] on the football team.  He received his degree in education in 1965.<ref name="CUP_HOF"/>

===Football career===
After college, Hughes spent the next fourteen years teaching biology and coaching football at the high school level in the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |Pittsburgh]] area.
