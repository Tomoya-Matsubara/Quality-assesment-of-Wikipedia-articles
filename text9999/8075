The '''United States of the Ionian Islands''' ({{lang-el|<U+0397><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+039A><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+0399><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+039D><U+03AE><U+03C3><U+03C9><U+03BD> (''Enomenon Kratos ton Ionion Neson'')}}, {{lang-it|Stati Uniti delle Isole Ionie}}) was a former [[state]] and [[amical protectorate]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] between [[1815]] and [[1864]].  It is located in modern [[Greece]], to whom it was ceded as a gift at the end of the protectorate.

==History==
Prior to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Ionian Islands had been part of the [[Republic of Venice]].  With the dissolution of that polity under the [[1797]] [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], it was annexed into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].  Between [[1798]] and [[1799]], the French were driven out by a joint [[Russian Empire|Russo]]-[[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] force.  The occupying forces founded the [[Septinsular Republic]], which lasted from [[1800]] until [[1807]].

The Ionian Islands were then re-annexed by the French into the [[Illyrian Provinces]].  In [[1809]], the United Kingdom defeated the French fleet off [[Zakynthos]] on [[2 October]], and captured [[Kefalonia]], [[Kythira]], and Zakynthos.  The British took Lefkada in 1810.  [[Corfu]] remained under French rule until 1814.

The [[Congress of Vienna]] agreed to place the Ionian Islands under the exclusive protection of the United Kingdom.  Despite British military administration, the [[Austrian Empire]] was guaranteed equal commercial status to the UK.  The arrangement was solidifed with the ratification of the 'Maitland [[constitution]]' on [[26 August]] [[1817]], which created a federation of the seven islands.

On [[29 March]] [[1864]], the United Kingdom, [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Second French Empire|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] signed the [[Treaty of London, 1864|Treaty of London]], pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification.  Thus, on [[28 May]], by proclamation of the [[Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands|Lord High Commissioner]], the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hertslet | first = Edward | editor =  | others =  | title = The map of Europe by treaty | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k960368/f31 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-07-21 | edition =  | year =  | publisher =  | location =  | pages = p. 1609 }}</ref>

==States==
As its name suggests, United States of the Ionian Islands was a [[federation]].  It included seven island states:

==Government==
The government was organised under the leadership of a [[Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands|Lord High Commissioner]], appointed by the [[British monarch]] on the advice of the British government.  In total, ten men served in this capacity, including [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] as a Lord High Commissioner Extraordinary.

The Ionian Islands had a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]], titled the '[[Parliament of the Ionian Islands|Parliament of the United States of the Ionian Islands]]' and composed of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Ionian Islands|Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Senate of the Ionian Islands|Senate]].<ref>Constitution of the Ionian Islands, Article VII</ref>
