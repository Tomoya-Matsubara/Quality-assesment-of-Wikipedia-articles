[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon Football Club]] was an English professional [[Association football|football]] club from [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], south-west [[London]]. Founded in 1889, the club spent most of its history in amateur and semi-professional [[non-League football]] prior to a "fairytale" rise through the divisions following election to [[The Football League]] in 1977. This success resulted in the club looking to move from its home ground, [[Plough Lane]], and seeking an alternative base.

Relocation to [[Milton Keynes]], a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] {{convert|56|mi|km|0}} to the north of Wimbledon, was originally considered in the late 1970s, soon after the club's election to the Football League, but not followed up. Various abortive local options were explored during the 1980s, but the 1991 [[Taylor Report]], which recommended all-seater stadia for all top-flight clubs, led the team to temporarily [[groundshare]] with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Selhurst Park]] whilst an alternative was sought. 

Milton Keynes, because of its foundation and designation as a new town in 1967, represented a unique situation in English football in that there was no professional team representing it that had secured the loyalty of local supporters. Wimbledon were not the only team to be approached regarding a move there &ndash; a move by Charlton was briefly mooted in 1973 and the subject was regularly broached with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], most notably in 1982. In the early 2000s, the Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium, led by [[Pete Winkelman]], proposed a Football League-standard stadium in Milton Keynes, partly funded by an attached retail development. The opportunity to take up this new ground was offered to Luton, Wimbledon, [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], Crystal Palace and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. Despite an initial negative response from Wimbledon, the appointment in 2000 by its owners of a new chairman, Charles Koppel, led to more receptive talks. 

The Wimbledon board announced its intention to move the club to Milton Keynes in August 2001; received permission in May 2002; and did so in September 2003. Soon after the relocation's confirmation in May 2002, supporters opposed to the move formed a new team, [[AFC Wimbledon]].  The relocated club renamed itself [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in June 2004 and after a period of time playing at the [[National Hockey Stadium]], moved to a new 22,000 seat stadium in the town playing their first game at the new ground in July 2007.

==Background to the relocation==
===The new town of Milton Keynes===
{{main|Milton Keynes}}
Following the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1945, the population of [[London]] increased significantly, causing the construction of a number of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] across the south-east of England. [[London overspill|Overspill]] housing for several London boroughs was constructed in [[Bletchley]], in north [[Buckinghamshire]], by [[London County Council]].<ref>{{cite web

===Previous Milton Keynes relocation proposals===

{{main|Relocation of professional sports teams#United Kingdom}}
In English football, the relocation of teams away from their traditional districts is extremely unusual because of nature of the relationship between clubs and their local fans: the local football club is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its owners at will. As a result, any relocation plan would be strongly opposed by fans in the club's original area, and unlikely to succeed in most new locations due to the existence of established local clubs in most towns and cities that would already have secured the loyalty of local supporters. However, due to its recent establishment in 1967, Milton Keynes provided an exception to this rule; most people living there had been born and raised elsewhere,<ref name="mkweb1">{{cite web

====Charlton Athletic====

The first Football League team to be linked with a move to the new town was [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], in 1973.

 | quote = There is no possibility of Charlton Athletic leaving The Valley unless we are forced out by the attitude of Greenwich Council. We wish to make this clear to our supporters who have flooded the club and the local papers this week, with letters following the announcement that we could move. The roots of Charlton Athletic Football Club are in this area and we are in no way disenchanted with the district or with the fans.
We are frustrated and disappointed by the attitude of Greenwich Council, who have stopped our plans to utilise The Valley during weekdays for the general benefit of the community and like other professional football clubs, we have got to look to the future for ways of safeguarding the club in the 1980s. One sure way is to make much more use of the facilities we have at our disposal.
We believe our plans for a sports complex and a 200-stall open market would have helped both the club and the Charlton area, much of which is in a depressed state and would have been the first step in creating a new concept in community participation.
You the supporters, can make sure the club continues in Charlton by protesting as loud as you can to Greenwich Council over their refusal to grant us permission for our plans. On Wednesday, the council met and discussed a scheme to site the sports complex in nearby Charlton Park on public open space. We still think this decision should be changed and feel sure that eventually common sense will prevail and lead to cooperation between the club and the council concerning the market.
As an interim pleasure we can under existing legislation operate the market for a limited number of days a year and intend to do this and by so doing prove the point of the value to the community.}}</ref>

| quote=Two directors of Luton Town, including the fans' representative on the board, resigned yesterday in protest at the uncertainty surrounding the club. Their decision came on the day the man who may or may not be the new owner of the club raised the far-fetched possibility of Luton merging with Wimbledon. John Gurney, who while at Farnborough Town in 1999 was arrested and remanded in Winchester prison on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine, arrived at Kenilworth Road three weeks ago. Cleared of the charge, he is the public face of an otherwise mysterious consortium of "businessmen" from as far afield as Hong Kong and the United States. ... "Should we buy them, merge them with Luton and play at Luton, effectively buying a back door to Division One?" Gurney asked of Wimbledon on Luton's website. "We will approach the administrator [of Wimbledon] to find out the terms, because it does no harm to ask the question." Unfortunately for Gurney, asking the question will do harm to his already limited credibility in English football in general and Luton in particular. The Football League, anxious not to inflame the situation, insisted diplomatically that it would "consider any move on its merits", but realistically there is no chance of a Luton-Wimbledon merger application being successful. ... With four directors already gone, the first resignation yesterday was that of Yvonne Fletcher, the fans' representative, who works for this newspaper. ... Luton, who finished ninth in the Second Division, lose some <U+00A3>3m-<U+00A3>4m a year and have unpaid bills in the region of <U+00A3>500,000. But Watson-Challis recently acquired a substantial plot of land near Junction 10 on the M1. It is claimed that the land has a commercial development value of <U+00A3>50m. Gurney has spoken of building a 70,000-capacity stadium there. Merging with Wimbledon is not his first fantastical suggestion, and he has also wondered aloud about changing the club's name to London Luton after the airport. ... She summed up the past three weeks at Kenilworth Road as "a complete nightmare, kind of Kafkaesque".}}</ref> Neither idea however was followed up.
