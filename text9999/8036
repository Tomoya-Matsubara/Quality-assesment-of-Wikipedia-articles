'''''How Brown Saw the Baseball Game''''', also known as '''''How Jones Saw the Baseball Game''''', is an American [[short film|short]] comedy film produced in 1907 and distributed by the [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]]. The film follows a baseball fan, named Mr. Brown, who drinks large quantities of alcoholic beverages before a baseball game and becomes so intoxicated that the game appears to him in reverse motion. During production, [[trick photography]] was used to achieve this effect.

The film was released in November 1907. It received positive reviews in a 1908 issue of ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'', a film journal, that reported the film was successful and "truly funny". {{As of|2013}} it is unclear whether a print of the film has survived. The identities of the film's cast and production crew are not known. Film historians have noted similarities between the plot of ''How Brown Saw the Baseball Game'' and the [[Edwin S. Porter]]-directed comedy film ''[[How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game]]'' released the previous year.

==Release and reception==
''How Brown Saw the Baseball Game'' was released into theaters by Lubin Manufacturing Company on November 16, 1907, and was still being shown as late as August 13, 1908.<ref name=AFI/><ref name=ocala>{{cite news|title=CHANGE OF PROGRAM DAILY|newspaper=The Ocala Evening Star|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00075908/00921/3j|date=August 13, 1908|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}</ref>  During this time, the film sometimes was presented as part of a [[double feature]] with the 1907 film ''Neighbors Who Borrow'', a short comedy film about a man who loans nearly everything he owns to his neighbors until his wife returns home and berates him for doing so.<ref name=ocala /><ref>{{cite journal|title=Neighbors Who Borrow|journal=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|date=December 14, 1907|volume=19|page=21}}</ref>

Advertisements for the film touted it as "such fun", and Lubin himself promoted the film as a "screamingly funny farce".<ref name=Erickson/><ref>{{cite journal|title=How Brown Saw the Baseball Game|journal=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|date=December 14, 1907|volume=19|page=21}}</ref> It received a positive review in the June 1908 issue of ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' which described the film as "truly funny" and that it proved to be "a veritable success".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Moving Picture World (June 1908)|url=https://archive.org/details/MPW02-1908-06|work=[[The Moving Picture World]]|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}</ref>

Modern writings have often suggested that ''How Brown Saw the Baseball Game'' was produced as Lubin Manufacturing Company's alternative to the [[Edwin S. Porter]]-directed comedy ''[[How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game]]'',<ref name=Erickson>{{harvnb|Erickson|1992|p=324}}</ref> a film released by [[Edison Studios]] in 1906<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|Pincus|2003|p=12}}</ref> about an office employee sneaking out of his workplace to watch a baseball game only to discover his employer in a nearby seat.<ref name=Elderman/> Lubin Manufacturing Company was known for creating films similar to competing motion pictures made by other studios. Lubin had previously created films resembling Edison Studios' releases ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin (film adaptations)|Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]''.<ref name=seiler/>

Author Jack Spears wrote in his book ''Hollywood: The Golden Era'' that ''How Brown Saw the Baseball Game'' and ''How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game'' "used practically the same plot";<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|1971|p=258}}</ref> Rob Elderman's article "The Baseball Film: to 1920" in the journal ''Base Ball'' likewise notes the similarities of their plotlines.<ref name=Elderman/> {{as of|December 2013}}, it is unclear whether there is a surviving print of ''How Brown Saw the Baseball Game''; it has likely become a [[lost film]]. If rediscovered, the film would be in the [[public domain]].<ref name=SilentEra/>
