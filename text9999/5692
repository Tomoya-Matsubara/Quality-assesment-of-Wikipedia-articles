==History==
Port Harcourt was founded in 1912 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in an area traditionally inhabited by the [[Ikwerre]], an [[Igbo]] subgroup <ref name="van">{{cite web |url= http://www.vanguardngr.com/2009/12/10/waterfronts-nobody%E2%80%99s-ancestral-home-david-west/|title= Waterfronts, nobody<U+2019>s ancestral home <U+2013> David-West|accessdate=2009-12-10 |work= www.vanguardngr.com|publisher=Vanguard (Lagos) Friday, December 10, 2009}}</ref> It was named after [[Lewis Vernon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt|Lewis, Viscount Harcourt]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]].<ref name="wpl">{{cite web |url= http://www.portharcourt.net/php/visitorinfo.php |title= Welcome to Port Harcourt |accessdate=2007-01-31 |work= AfricanCities.net|publisher=White Pages Limited }}</ref> The initial purpose of the port was to export the [[coal]] which geologist [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] had discovered in [[Enugu]].

==Geography and infrastructure==
===Geography===
The main city of Port Harcourt is the Port Harcourt town in the Port Harcourt City Local Government Area, consisting of the former European quarters now called old Government reservation area (GRA) and New layout areas. The Port Harcourt Urban Area (Port Harcourt metropolis) is made up of the city itself and parts of [[Obio/Akpor]] Local Government Area.<ref> Ogbonna, D.N. / Amangabara, G.T. / Ekere, T.O.: [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Articles/0830180107.html "Urban solid waste generation in Port Harcourt metropolis and its implications for waste management]", ''Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal'', Volume: 18 Issue: 1; 2007</ref>. Port Harcourt City, which the capital of Rivers State, is highly congested as it is the only major city of the state. A law has recently passed by the state house and governor Amaechi's administration to spread develop to the surrounding communities as part of the effort to decongest Port Harcourt. The greater Port Harcourt City, as it is officially known, spans eight local government areas that include Port Harcourt, [[Okrika]], [[Obio/Akpor]], [[Ikwerre]], [[Oyigbo]] and  [[Ogu/Bolo]]. Also, other ethnicities includes Tai, and Eleme.

===Infrastructure===
Some of Port Harcourt's more popular and well-known residential areas are [[Port Harcourt Township]] (better known simply as ''Town''), [[G.R.A phases 1-5]], [[Rumuomasi]], [[Orogbum nu Oro Abali]] (known as Ogbunuabali), [[Rumuola]], [[Diobu]], [[Amadi Flats]], and [[Borokiri]]. The main industrial area is located in [[Trans Amadi]]. 

The city plays host to the [[Rivers State University of Science and Technology]]; there is also a [[University of Port Harcourt]], which is Located in Obio/Akpor which was carved out of Port Harcourt Local Government Area for ease of administration. 

The [[Podium Block]] of [[Rivers State Secretariat]] is an icon of the city. An eighteen storey building, it has the tallest building in the [[South/South]] and [[South/East]] Geopolitical zones combined. The city has an international airport, [[Port Harcourt International Airport]], two seaports ([[F.O.T Onne]], [[PortHarcourt Wharf]]), two stadiums ([[Sharks Stadium]] which is actually the civic center] and [[Liberation Stadium]] located in Elekahia and two refineries.

The city is sprawling in nature as building codes and zoning regulations are poorly enforced. Land is cleared and 'lean to' buildings constructed sometimes overnight. This adds to flooding and sanitation problems since with no proper drainage or sewer system, parts of the city flood during the very heavy monsoon-type rains that fall for half the year.

==Climate==
Port Harcourt features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] with lengthy and heavy [[wet season|rainy seasons]] and very short [[dry season|dry seasons]]. In fact, only the months of December and January truly qualifies as dry season months in the city. The [[harmattan]], which climatically influences many cities in [[West Africa]], is less pronounced in Port Harcourt. Port Harcourt<U+2019>s heaviest precipitation is seen during the month of September where on average approximately 370 mm of rain is seen. December on average is the driest month of the year, where on average only 20 mm of rain is seen during the course of the month. Temperatures throughout the year in the city are relatively constant, showing little variation throughout the course of the year. Average temperatures are typically between 25<U+00BA>C-28<U+00BA>C in the city.

==Economy==
The city is a major industrial center as it has a large number of [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] firms as well as other industrial concerns, particularly business related to the [[petroleum]] industry. It is the chief oil-refining city in Nigeria.Rivers state is one of the wealthiest states in Nigeria in terms of gross domestic product and foreign exchange revenue from the oil industry, crude oil being its main export earner.

==Security issues==
In recent times, the activities of several armed militant gangs has cast a huge shadow on life and commerce in the once peaceful town. These gangs that for the most part claim to fight for the interest of the indigenous people of Rivers State and the [[Niger Delta]] region of [[Nigeria]] by asking for a share Nigeria's oil wealth, are however better noted and feared for violent conduct that include random and targeted killings, arson, kidnappings of both foreign workers and indigenous people and bombings. After a spate of violence in 2007, a curfew was imposed on the town, this was however lifted by the Governor of [[Rivers State]] in the last days of 2007. On New Year's Eve 2007, Port Harcourt was once again rocked by violence which left at least sixteen people dead. [[Ateke Tom]], the leader of one of the more prominent militias claimed responsibility for most of the fatalities.
But now,Port Harcourt has seemingly had some sense of peace and security due to the introduction of the amnesty by the federal Government for the militants.

== Greater Port-Harcourt City ==

In early 2009 the State Government under the leadership of Governor Chibuike Amaechi announced plans for the creation of a new city to be called the Greater Port-Harcourt City. The new city is to be located close to the Port-Harcourt International Airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200904080024.html|title=Nigeria: Why Rivers is Embarking on Port Harcourt City Project - Nwuke|last=Onoyume|first=Jimitota|date=8 April 2009|work=[[AllAfrica.com]]|publisher=AllAfrica Global Media|language=English|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>
