'''Janusz (John) Antoni Brzozowski''' (born on May 10, 1935 in Warsaw, Poland) is a Polish-Canadian computer scientist.

In 1962, Brzozowski earned his PhD in the field of electrical engineering at [[Princeton University]] under [[Edward J. McCluskey]]. The topic of the thesis was ''Regular Expression Techniques for Sequential Circuits''. From 1967 to 1996 he was Professor at the University of Waterloo. He is best known for his influential contributions to mathematical logic, circuit theory and [[automata theory]].

==Achievements in research==
Brzozowski is renowned in particular for his fundamental work on regular expressions and on [[syntactic semigroup]]s of formal languages.<ref name="Pin97">Pin (1997)</ref> A notable achievement was the algebraic characterization of
locally testable events together with [[Imre Simon]], which had a similar impact<ref>Diekert et al. (2008)</ref> on the development of the algebraic theory of formal languages as [[Sch<U+00FC>tzenberger]]'s famous characterization of the [[star-free language]]s.

In the area, there are today at least three concepts bearing Brzozowski's name in honour of his contributions: The first is the ''Brzozowski conjecture''<ref name="DeLucaVaricchio">de Luca and Varicchio (1997)</ref> about the regularity of noncounting classes. Second, ''Brzozowski's algorithm'' <ref>Shallit (2009), ch. 3.10</ref> is a conceptually simple algorithm for performing [[DFA minimization]]. Third, [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]]'s reference work on automata theory has a chapter devoted to the so-called ''Brzozowski hierarchy''<ref>Eilenberg (1974)</ref> inside the [[star-free language]]s, also known as ''dot-depth hierarchy''. Curiously, Brzozowski was not only co-author of the paper<ref>Cohen and Brzozowski (1971)</ref> that defined the [[dot-depth hierarchy]] and raised the question whether this hierarchy is strict, he later also was co-author of the paper<ref>Brzozowski and Knast (1979)</ref> resolving that problem after roughly ten years. The Brzozowski hierarchy gained further importance after Thomas discovered a relation between the algebraic concept of dot-depth and the alternation depth of quantifiers in [[first-order logic]] via [[Ehrenfeucht-Fra<U+00EF>ss<U+00E9> game]]s.<ref>Thomas (1982)</ref>

He received the following academic awards:
* NSERC Scientific Exchange Award to France (1974&ndash;1975)
* Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowship (1984)
* Distinguished Professor Emeritus, [[University of Waterloo]], Canada (1996)<ref>[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/profile/brzozo.shtml Profile of John Brzozowski]</ref>
* Medal of Merit, Catholic University of Lublin, Poland (2001)
* Canadian Pioneer in Computing<ref>[https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/archives/2005/pioneers/index.shtml Pioneers of Computing in Canada]</ref> (2005)
