The '''Aztec Ruins National Monument''' preserves ancestral [[Pueblo]] structures in north-western [[New Mexico]], [[United States of America|United States]], located close to the town of [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]] and northeast of [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]], near the [[Animas River]]. '''[[Salmon Ruins]] and Heritage Park''', with more ancestral Pueblo structures, lies a short distance to the south, just west of [[Bloomfield, New Mexico|Bloomfield]] near the San Juan River.
The buildings date back to the 11th to 13th centuries, and the misnomer attributing them to the [[Aztec]] civilization can be traced back to early American settlers in the mid-19th century. The actual construction was by the ancestral Puebloans, the [[Anasazi]].

The site was declared "Aztec Ruin [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]" on January 24, 1923, and with a boundary change it was renamed "Ruins" on July 2, 1928. As an historical property of the [[National Park Service]] the National Monument was administratively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966. Aztec Ruins was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]], as part of the [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]], on December 8, 1987.
