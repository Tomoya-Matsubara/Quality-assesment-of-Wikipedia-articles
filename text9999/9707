'''''Start a War''''' is the fourth [[Static-X]] album; it was released in June 2005. A special version was shipped with an additional  [[DVD]] disc titled ''X-Rated''.  

The album marks the return of former guitarist [[Koichi Fukuda]], (although he did not play any guitars on the album, he did help with the programming), the first studio album with drumming provided by [[Nick Oshiro]], and the second and last album that guitarist [[Tripp Eisen]] wrote and performed on. The album continues the change in sound found on Shadow Zone but many of the songs featured on Start a War are Heavier and feature a lot more screaming and aggressive lyrics. Songs that best show this are I Want To Fucking Break It, The Enemy, and Start a War. The whole tone of the album is more aggressive then Shadow Zone. The song Pieces features a Guitar solo; this is a interesting note because the band did not perform them on past albums,, but on the band's next album named Cannibal guitar solos play a much bigger part on the band's music. Start a War is also the last album to feature one the bands unique Otsego songs. When asked about the album, [[Wayne Static]] said - "''We wanted to try to recreate the fun spirit of Wisconsin Death Trip; having Koichi back, with his flavor, helped.''"

==DVD version - X-Rated==
Start a War was also available in a bonus edition [[digipak]] with a DVD titled ''X-Rated''.

===Band footage===
Most of the DVD was filmed whilst guitarist [[Tripp Eisen]] was in the band. When he left the band, he had to be 'edited' out of the DVD, though he can still be seen in some shots. New live footage was filmed with [[Koichi Fukuda]]. Consequently, this means that most of the DVD has footage only of Tony, Nick and Wayne.

===Contents of the DVD===
* Making of the record. (Footage of the band making/recording the record and a footage of a photoshoot.)
* Rehearsal footage. (In order - "The Enemy", "Start a War", "I'm the One", "Dirthouse")
* Live tour footage. Each song also has footage of the band's crazy antics (in order - "Permanence", "The Trance is the Motion", "Monster")
* "Desert Fun" - Wayne and Tony driving around the desert in trucks with the tracks "Otsego Amigo" and "I Want To Fucking Break It" being played.
* Instrumental songs ("Dirthouse", "Otsego Amigo", "Pieces", "Skinnyman", "Start a War")
* Full album in 5.1 surround sound.
