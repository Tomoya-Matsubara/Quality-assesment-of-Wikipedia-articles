As British settlers in the area came to outnumber the French, the name "Green Bay" (from the French: ''Baie Verte'') became the more common name for the town. In 1783 the town became part of the [[United States|United States of America]].

== Transportation ==
[[Image:2-8-0 at NRM, Green Bay, 20040426.jpg|thumb|US Army 101, on display at the [[National Railroad Museum]]]]
Green Bay is served by [[Austin Straubel International Airport]]. 

The city was the headquarters of the [[Green Bay and Western Railroad]] from 1896 to 1993. After the GB&W quit, the line was purchased by Wisconsin Central Transportation.  In 2001, the WC was merged into the Canadian National system. The Chicago and North Western Railway also served Green Bay, and their depot still stands today. Green Bay was last served with a regular passenger train, the CNW's Peninsula 400, in 1971. The CNW sold its trackage from Green Bay south to Sheboygan in 1987 to the Fox River Valley Railroad, which became part of the WC in 1993. Green Bay also saw passenger service from the Milwaukee Road's Chippewa Hiawatha, which ran from Chicago into the UP of Michigan. Green Bay is also served by the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad. Amtrak expansion to Green Bay is part of the Midwest Regional Rail Project, and would follow a route from Milwaukee through Fond Du Lac, Oshkosh and Appleton. Milwaukee-Madison to Milwaukee service is top priority for the State of Wisconsin at this time, with the Green Bay project on the back burner.

Green Bay also has its own [[mass transit]] system 
known as [[Green Bay Metro]] (formerly known as Green Bay Transit).

Green Bay is connected to the rest of the state by four major highways.  [[US Highway 41]] connects Green Bay to the Fox Cities, [[Fond du Lac]] and [[Milwaukee]] to the south and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] via [[Oconto, Wisconsin|Oconto]], [[Peshtigo, Wisconsin|Peshtigo]], and [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]].  [[U.S. Route 141]] starts in Green Bay and joins with US41 to the north for 18 miles before splitting off and providing access to the Upper Peninsula via [[Niagara, Wisconsin|Niagara]].  [[Interstate 43]], which terminates at US 41/141, heads south along [[Lake Michigan]] to Milwaukee and on to [[Illinois]] via [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]].  Recently [[Wisconsin Highway 29]] has been upgraded to four lanes to provide better access to western Wisconsin and [[Minnesota]] via [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] and [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]].<br />  
A few other highways of importance are :<br />
[[Wisconsin Highway 172]]: Forms a southern bypass of Green Bay, and continuing to Austin Staubel Airport.  <br />
[[Wisconsin Highway 32]]: Two lane highway which runs from Illinois to Michigan and provides alternative routes to the north and south and travels through many small communities.<br />
[[Wisconsin Highway 54]]: Two lane highway which runs through Green Bay from [[Algoma, Wisconsin|Algoma]] to [[New London, Wisconsin|New London]] and [[Waupaca, Wisconsin|Waupaca]].<br />
