The '''Northern Court''', also known as the Ashikaga Pretenders or Northern Pretenders, were a set of 6 claimants to the throne of [[Japan]].

The origins of the Northern Court go back to [[Emperor Go-Saga]], reigning from 1242 to 1246.  Go-Saga was succeeded in turn by two of his sons, [[Emperor Go-Fukakusa]] and [[Emperor Kameyama]].  The descendants of these two competed with each other for the throne.  Go-Fukakusa's descendants were referred to as the Jimy<U+014D>in-t<U+014D> while Kameyama's descendants were known as the Daikakuji-t<U+014D>.

In 1333, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (from the Daikakuji-t<U+014D>) staged the [[Kemmu Restoration]] and revolted against the [[Kamakura shogunate]], the [[Shogun|Sh<U+014D>gun]] responded by declaring [[Emperor K<U+014D>gon]], Go-Daigo's [[second cousin once removed]] and the son of an earlier emperor, [[Emperor Go-Fushimi]] of the Jimy<U+014D>in-t<U+014D>, as the new emperor. After the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, K<U+014D>gon lost his claim, but his brother, [[Emperor K<U+014D>my<U+014D>]], and two of his sons were supported by the new Ashikaga shoguns as the rightful claimants to the throne. K<U+014D>gon's family thus formed a northern court which was rivalled by the southern court of Go-Daigo and his descendants. In 1392, [[Emperor Go-Kameyama]] of the Southern Court was defeated and abdicated in favor of K<U+014D>gon's great-grandson, [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]], thus ending the divide.  Go-Kameyama signed an agreement with Go-Komatsu to return to the old alternations on a ten-year plan.  However, Go-Komatsu broke this promise, not only ruling for 20 years, but being succeeded by his own son, rather than by one from the former Southern Court.  Because they were the ancestors of all the subsequent emperors, the Northern Court was for centuries afterward officially described as the true Imperial Family. However, since 1911, the Japanese government has declared the southern claimants were actually the rightful emperors because they retained possession of the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|three sacred treasures]], making these six officially pretenders.
