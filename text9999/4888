'''Frances Rix Ames''' (20 April 1920 <U+2013> 11 November 2002) was a South African [[neurologist]], psychiatrist, and human rights activist, best known for supporting a medical ethics inquiry into the death of [[anti-apartheid]] activist [[Steve Biko]], who died from medical neglect after being [[Medical torture|tortured]] in police custody.  When the South African Medical and Dental Council (SAMDC) declined to discipline the chief district surgeon and his assistant  who treated Biko, Ames and a group of five academics and physicians raised funds and fought an eight-year legal battle against the medical establishment.  Ames risked her personal safety and academic career in her pursuit of justice, taking the dispute to the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|South African Supreme Court]], where she eventually won the case in 1985.

Born in Pretoria and raised in poverty in Cape Town, Ames was the first woman to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from the [[University of Cape Town]] in 1954; a decade later, she become its first female professor.<ref name="hrc">Bateman, Chris (January 2003).

Retrieved January 15, 2015.</ref>  Ames  studied the effects of cannabis on the brain and published several articles on the subject; seeing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis on patients in her own hospital, she became an early proponent of legalization for [[medical cannabis|medicinal use]].   She headed the neurology department at [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] before retiring in 1985, but continued to lecture at Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital. After [[apartheid]] was finally dismantled in 1994, Ames testified at the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] about her work on the "Biko doctors" medical ethics inquiry.  In 1999, [[Nelson Mandela]] awarded Ames the Star of South Africa, the country's highest civilian award, in recognition of her work on behalf of human rights.

==Early life==
Ames was born at [[Voortrekkerhoogte]] in Pretoria, South Africa, on 20 April 1920, to Frank and Georgina Ames, the second of three daughters.  Her mother, who was raised in a Boer
concentration camp by Ames' grandmother, a nurse in the [[Second Boer War]], was also a nurse.  Ames never knew her father, who left her mother alone to raise three daughters in poverty.<ref name="unde">van der Unde, Ina (November 1995).

In Cape Town, Ames interned at [[Groote Schuur Hospital]]; she also worked in the [[Transkei]] region as a general practitioner.  She earned her MD degree in 1954 from UCT, the first woman to do so.<ref name="shaw">Shaw, Gerald (21 November 2014). [http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/22/guardianobituaries Frances Ames].

==Biko affair==
South African anti-apartheid activist [[Steve Biko]], who had formerly studied medicine at the [[University of Natal Medical School]], was detained by [[Port Elizabeth]] security police on 18 August 1977 and held for 20 days.  Sometime between 6-7 September, Biko was beaten and tortured into a coma.<ref name="shaw"/>  According to allegations by Ames and others, surgeon Ivor Lang, along with chief district surgeon Benjamin Tucker, collaborated with the police and covered up the abuse, leading to Biko's death from his injuries on 12 September. According to Bentar & Bentar 2012, "there were clear ethical breaches on the part of the doctors who were responsible" for Biko.<ref name="Benatar">Benatar, Solomon R.; David Benatar (1 June 2012).

When the South African Medical and Dental Council (SAMDC) along with the support of the Medical Association of South Africa (MASA), declined to discipline the district surgeons in Biko's death, two groups of physicians filed separate formal complaints with the SAMDC regarding the lack of professionalism shown by Biko's doctors. Both cases made their way to the South African Supreme Court in an attempt to force the SAMDC to conduct a formal inquiry into the medical ethics of Lang and Tucker.  One case was filed by Ames, along with Trefor Jenkins and Phillip Tobias of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]; a second case was filed by Dumisani Mzana, Yosuf Veriava of Coronationville Hospital, and Tim Wilson of Alexandra Health Centre.<ref name="Baldwin"/><ref>Biko doctors: Verdic 'lenient'.

After eight years, Ames successfully won the case in 1985 when the South African Supreme Court ruled in her favor. The two doctors who treated Biko were finally disciplined.<ref name="rich"/>  With Ames' help, the case forced the medical regulatory body to reverse their decision and  "exposed the collusion of the medical profession in the suppression and torture of anti-apartheid activists".<ref>Veriava, F.

==Cannabis research==
Ames studied the [[effects of cannabis]] in 1958, publishing her work in ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry |The British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' as "A clinical and metabolic study of acute intoxication with ''Cannabis sativa'' and its role in the model psychoses".  Her work is cited extensively throughout the cannabis literature.  She opposed the [[War on Drugs]] and was a proponent of the [[Medical cannabis|therapeutic benefits of cannabis]], particularly for people with [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS).<ref>Ames, Frances (December 12, 1995).

South African neurosurgeon Colin Froman referred to Ames as the "great and unorthodox protagonist for the medical use of marijuana many years before the current interest in its use as a therapeutic drug".<ref name="Froman"/> J. P. van Niekerk of the ''[[South African Medical Journal]]'' notes that "Frances Ames led by conviction and example" and history eventually justified her action in the Bioko affair.<ref name="Niekerk"/> 

Ames's work on the Biko affair led to major medical reforms in South Africa, including the disbanding and replacement of the old apartheid-era medical organisations which failed to uphold the medical standards of the profession.<ref name="myser"/> According to van Niekerk, "the most enduring lesson for South African medicine was the clarification of the roles of medical practitioners when there is a question of dual responsibilities. This is now embodied inter alia in the SAMA Code of Conduct and in legal interpretations of doctors' responsibilities".<ref name="Niekerk">van Niekerk, J. P. (January 2003).
