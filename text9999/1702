==Early settlement and economy==
{{see|List of places in Middlesex}}
Middlesex was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as being divided into the six [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]] of [[Edmonton (hundred)|Edmonton]], [[Elthorne]], [[Gore (hundred)|Gore]], Hounslow ([[Isleworth (hundred)|Isleworth]] in all later records),<ref name=isleworth>{{cite british history | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22269 | title=The hundred of Isleworth | publication=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 3 | year=1962 | accessdate=20 February 2008 }}</ref> [[Ossulstone]] and [[Spelthorne (hundred)|Spelthorne]]. The [[City of London]], which has been self-governing since the [[13th century|thirteenth century]], was geographically within the county and it also included [[Westminster]], which had a high degree of autonomy. Of the six hundreds, Ossulstone contained the districts closest to the City of London. During the 17th century it was divided into four divisions, which, along with the [[Liberty of Westminster]], largely took over the administrative functions of the hundred. The divisions were named [[Finsbury division|Finsbury]], [[Holborn division|Holborn]], [[Kensington division|Kensington]] and [[Tower division|Tower]].<ref name=ossulstone>{{cite vob|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10031163|name=Ossulstone hundred|accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref> The county had [[Parliamentary representation from Middlesex|parliamentary representation]] from the 13th century. The title [[Earl of Middlesex]] was created twice, in 1622 and 1677 but became extinct in 1843.<ref name=eb1911/>

The economy of the county was dependent on the City of London and was primarily agricultural.<ref name=rural_old/> All manner of good were provided for the City, including crops such as grain and hay, livestock and building materials. Tourism in early resorts such as Hackney, Islington and [[Highgate]] also formed part of the early economy. However, during the 18th century the inner parishes of Middlesex started to instead function as suburbs of the City and were increasingly urbanised.<ref name=rural_old/>

==Modern history==
===Expansion of the metropolis===
{{see|Population of Middlesex (1801<U+2014>1881)}}
During the 19th century, the [[East End of London]] had expanded to the eastern boundary with Essex and the Tower division had reached a population of over a million.<ref name=vic_pop/> Following the coming of the railways, the north-western suburbs of London had steadily covered large parts of the county.<ref name=wolmar/> The areas closest to London were served by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from 1829 and from 1840 the entire county was included in the [[Metropolitan Police District]].<ref name=met>Order in Council enlarging the Metropolitan Police District (SI 1840 5001)</ref> Local government in the county was unreformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] and civic works were instead carried out by individual parish vestries or ad-hoc [[improvement commissioners]].<ref>''Local Government Areas 1834 -1945'', V D Lipman, Oxford, 1949 </ref><ref>Joseph Fletcher, ''The Metropolis; its Boundaries, Extent, and Divisions for Local Government'' in ''Journal of the Statistical Society of London'', Vol. 7, No. 2. (June 1844), pp. 103-143.</ref> In 1855 the parishes of the densely populated area to the south east, but excluding the City of London, came within the responsibility of the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]].<ref name=saint/> Despite this innovation, the system was described by commentators at the time as one "in chaos".<ref name=barlow/> In 1889, under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], the metropolitan area of approximately {{convert|30000|acre|0}} became part of the [[County of London]].<ref name=eb1911/> The Act also provided that the part of Middlesex in the administrative county of London should be "severed from [Middlesex], and form a separate county for all non-administrative purposes".

[[Image:1882 Reynolds Map.jpg|thumb|Map in 1882 shows complete urbanisation of the East End]]
The part of the County of London that had been transferred from Middlesex was divided in 1900 into [[metropolitan borough]]s, which were merged in 1965 to form seven of the present-day [[inner London]] boroughs, such that [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead|Hampstead]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Holborn|Holborn]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras|St Pancras]]; [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington|Stoke Newington]]; [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fuham]] was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith|Hammersmith]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Fulham|Fulham]]; [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury|Finsbury]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington|Islington]]; [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington and Chelsea]] was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea|Chelsea]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Kensington|Kensington]]; [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green|Bethnal Green]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar|Poplar]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney|Stepney]]; and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of Paddington|Paddington]], [[Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone|St Marylebone]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Westminster|Westminster]]. <ref name=saint/>

===Extra-metropolitan area===
{{see|History of local government districts in Middlesex (1894<U+2014>1965)}}
Following the Local Government Act 1888, the remaining county came under the control of Middlesex County Council except for the parish of [[Monken Hadley]], which became part of [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=hadley>{{cite vob|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10020530&c_id=10001043|name=Monken Hadley|accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref> The area of responsibilty of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex]] was reduced accordingly. Middlesex did not contain any [[county borough]]s, so the county and [[administrative county]] (the area of county council control) were identical. The [[Local Government Act 1894]] divided the administrative county into four [[rural district]]s and thirty-one [[urban district]]s, based on existing [[sanitary district]]s. One urban district, [[South Hornsey]] was a detached part of Middlesex within the [[County of London]] until 1900, when it was transferred to the latter county.<ref name=youngs>Frederic Youngs, ''Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England'', Vol.I : Southern England, London, 1979 </ref> The rural districts were [[Hendon Rural District|Hendon]], [[Potters Bar Urban District|South Mimms]], [[Staines Rural District|Staines]] and [[Uxbridge Rural District|Uxbridge]].

After 1889 the growth of London did not cease and the county became almost entirely urbanised by its suburbs with a significant rise in population density.

===Arms of Middlesex County Council===
[[Image:Middx arms.png|thumb|Coat of arms of Middlesex County Council]]
[[Coat of arms|Coats of arms]] were attributed by the medieval [[officers of arms|heralds]] to the Kingdoms of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Heptarchy]]. That assigned to the [[Kingdom of Essex|Kingdom of the Middle and East Saxons]] depicted three "seaxes" or short notched swords on a red background. The seaxe was a weapon carried by Anglo-Saxon warriors, and the term "Saxon" may be derived from the word.<ref name=armoury>Doherty, F., ''[http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_seax.html The Anglo Saxon Broken Back Seax]''. Retrieved on 20 February 2008</ref><ref name=saxon>Online Etymology Dictionary - [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Saxon Saxon]. Retrieved on 20 February 2008.</ref> These arms became associated with the two counties that approximated to the kingdom: Middlesex and [[Essex]]. County authorities, militia and volunteer regiments associated with both counties used the attributed arms. In 1910 it was noted that the county councils of Essex and Middlesex and the [[High Sheriff|Sheriff's Office]] of the [[County of London]] were all using the same arms.

The Middlesex County Council decided to apply for a formal grant of arms from the [[College of Arms]], with the addition of an heraldic "difference" added to the attributed arms. Colonel Otley Parry, a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Middlesex and author of a book on military badges, was asked to devise an addition to the shield. The chosen addition was a "Saxon Crown", derived from the portrait of King [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]] on a silver penny of his reign, stated to be the earliest form of crown associated with any English sovereign. The grant of arms was made by [[letters patent]] dated [[7 November]] [[1910]].<ref name=times_armorial>''Armorial bearings of Middlesex'', The Times. 7 November 1910.</ref><ref name=fox>''The Book of Public Arms'', A.C.

If granted to all these boroughs, it would have reduced the population of the administrative county of Middlesex by over half, to just shy of a million. 

Following the [[Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London]] nearly all the remainder of Middlesex became part of [[Greater London]] in 1965 and formed the new [[outer London]] boroughs of [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]] (part only), [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]], [[London Borough of Hounslow|Hounslow]] and [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]] (part only).<ref name=schedule>Office of Public Sector Information - [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1963/cukpga_19630033_en_1 London Government Act 1963 (as amended)].

===County town===
[[Image:middlesex.guildhall.london.arp.jpg|thumb|The Middlesex Guildhall at Westminster]]
Middlesex does not have a single established historic county town, with different locations having been used for different county purposes. The [[Assize Court|County Assizes]] for Middlesex were held at the [[Old Bailey]] in the [[City of London]].<ref name=rural_old/> Until 1889 the [[High Sheriff|Sheriff]] of Middlesex was chosen by the [[City of London Corporation]]. The sessions house for the Middlesex Quarter Sessions was at [[Clerkenwell Green]] from the early eighteenth century. The quarter sessions at the former [[Middlesex Sessions House]] performed most of the administration of the county until the creation of the Middlesex County Council in 1889.

[[New Brentford]] was first described as the county town in 1789, on the basis that it was the location of elections of knights for the shire (or [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]) from 1701.<ref name=ealing_brentford>{{cite british history | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22575&strquery=ealing%20growth | title=Ealing and Brentford: Growth of Brentford | publication =A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 7| year=1982 | accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref><ref name=eb1911>Encyclopedia Britannica, 1911 Edition</ref> In 1795, New Brentford was "considered as the county-town; but there is no town-hall or other public building".<ref name=environ_brentford>{{cite british history | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45404&strquery=brentford | title=Brentford | publication=The Environs of London: volume 2: County of Middlesex | year=1795| accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref> Middlesex County Council, which took over the administrative duties of the Quarter Sessions in 1889, was based at the [[Middlesex Guildhall]], in [[Westminster]]. This was in the [[County of London]], and thus outside the council's area of jurisdiction.

The transfer of Potters Bar to Hertfordshire was adopted by the Royal Mail, but the transfers of Staines and Sunbury to Surrey were not. The remaining postal county consisted of two unconnected areas (Enfield and the rest) and comprised the following post towns:

<U+2020> = postal county was not required

The postal county included many anomalies where the [[post town]]s it consisted of encroached on neighbouring counties, such as the village of [[Denham, Buckinghamshire]], which is included in the post town of [[Uxbridge]]<ref name=mail/> and was therefore within the postal county of Middlesex; conversely, [[Hampton Wick]] was not included in the Middlesex postal county as it was served by post towns based in Surrey. This gave rise to the misconception that [[Hampton Court Palace]] was located in Surrey.<ref name=palace>Historic Royal Palaces - [http://www.hrp.org.uk/HamptonCourtPalace/planyourvisit/gettingthere.aspx Hampton Court: How to find us]. Retrieved on 20 February 2008.</ref> [[Wraysbury]], Berkshire and [[Egham Hythe]], Surrey are served by the Staines post town<ref name=mail/> and thus were also included in the Middlesex postal county.
