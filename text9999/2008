The {{nihongo|'''Harusame class destroyers'''|<U+6625><U+96E8><U+578B><U+99C6><U+9010><U+8266>|Harusamegata kuchikukan}} was a [[ship class|class]] of seven [[torpedo boat destroyer]]s (TBDs) of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The ''Harusame''-class of destroyers were the first destroyers to be built in Japan. <ref> Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945 </ref>

==Background==
The ''Harusame''-class destroyers were part of the 1894 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ten-year expansion and modernization plan for based on lessons learned in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. In the second phase of this plan, from fiscal 1897, after 12 destroyers had been imported from the [[United Kingdom]], budget cutbacks reduced the number of new vessels to only four more (two each from the [[Akizuki class destroyer|''Akitsuki'']] and [[Shirakumo class destroyer|''Shirakumo''-classes]].

In fiscal year 1900, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to cancel plans for a torpedo boat tender, which freed funds to purchase four additional destroyers. Likewise, in fiscal 1903, the cancellation of six planned utility vessels freed funds to produce an additional three destroyers.

In order to cut costs and to help develop the Japanese shipbuilding industry, it was decided to construct all seven of the new destroyers at Japanese yards. The first four were built at the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], and the remaining three at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]]. <ref> Howarth, The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun</ref> 

==Design==
The ''Harusame''-class ships attempted to incorporate the best features of the existing destroyer designs in the Navy's inventory. The [[Bow (ship)|bow]] design and front half of the vessel was substantially identical to the previous [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow-built]] [[Ikazuchi class destroyer|''Ikazuchi''-class]], whereas the aft section was a copy of the previous [[John I. Thornycroft & Company |Thornycroft-built]] [[Murakumo class destroyer|''Murakumo''-class]].

Externally, the design retained the four-[[smokestack]]s of the ''Ikazuchi'', and the improved [[rudder]] design of the ''Akitsuki''<U+2013>class. The main design issue was with the [[coal|coal-fired]] [[steam engine|triple expansion steam engines]], which copied the design of the Yarrow [[water-tube boiler]]s. As with the ''Ikazuchi''-class, the rated power was 7,000 [[Horsepower#Shaft horsepower (shp)|shp]]; however, problems with quality of the materials and construction meant that actual maximum power was considerably less. <ref>Evans, Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887-1941</ref>

Armament was the similar to the previous ''Ikazuchi'' and ''Murakumo'' classes; i.e. two [[British ordnance terms#QF|QF]] [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12 pounder]] on a bandstand on the [[forecastle]], four [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] (two sided abreast the [[conning tower]], and two sided between the funnels and two single tubes for 18 inch [[torpedo]]es. <ref>Jane, The Imperial Japanese Navy</ref>

==Operational history==
All of the ''Harusame''-class destroyers were completed in time to be used in combat during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, with the final three vessels completed just in time to take part in the crucial final [[Battle of Tsushima]]. ''Hayatori'' was lost after striking a [[naval mine]] during the conflict off of [[L<U+00FC>shunkou|Port Arthur]] {{coor dm|38|47|S|121|30|E}}<ref>Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy </ref>.

''Harusame'' was lost in 1911 after running aground in Matoya Bay in [[Mie Prefecture]], Japan {{coor dm|34|25|N|137|00|E}}<ref>Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy </ref>. On [[1912-08-28]], the remaining five vessels were derated to third-class destroyers and were removed from front line combat service. However, all five served again during [[World War I]], albiet in minor roles. 

All five surviving vessels were converted to auxiliary [[minesweeper]]s on [[1922-04-01]], but were used for only a year until converted to unarmed utility vessels, and were then subsequently scrapped in 1924 or 1926. <ref>Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy </ref>
