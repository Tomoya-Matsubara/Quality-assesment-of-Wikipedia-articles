It was a freezing afternoon for the deciding test, which Australia dominated yet was still unable to put points on the board.<ref>{{cite web|last=de la Rivi<U+00E8>re|first=Richard|title=1929/30 Ashes Series|url=http://richarddelariviere.co.uk/?p=624|work=Thirteen|publisher=richarddelariviere.co.uk|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>  With only a few minutes remaining and the scores locked at nil-all in the third and deciding test, Busch collected the ball from a [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]] win 30 metres out and scooted down the sideline. He crashed over the try-line in the corner with England's loose forward Butters on his back making a last-ditch attempt to stop him. As the corner post went flying the crowd spilled onto the field in excitement. [[Rugby league match officials|Referee]] Bob Robinson looked set to award Australia the [[try]] and the game (and with it the Ashes) when the touch-judge Albert Webster emerged through the crowd claiming Busch had taken out the corner post before grounding the ball. Even though the referee believed it was a fair try he had no option other than to rule 'no try'. The referee was reported to have said to the Kangaroos "fair try Australia, but I am overruled". The match finished as a 0-0 draw, leaving the series tied at one match apiece. For the remainder of his life Busch insisted he scored the try, quoted as saying "I got it down all right<U+2026>it was a fair try."<ref>{{cite news|title=League's Grand Old Man Departs|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=1999-05-31}}</ref> The corner where Busch scored the disallowed try in Swinton, is still officially known as Busch<U+2019>s Corner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Youth from bush jumped straight into Test league|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|date=11/5/1979}}</ref>

In this match Cec Fifield broke his ankle and was unable to play the remainder of the tour. In an enthralling and especially brutal match, the deadlock was only broken by Stan Smith's solitary unconverted [[try]] so England won 3-0, to retain the Ashes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tony Collins|title=Rugby League in Twentieth Century Britain: A Social and Cultural History|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=UK|isbn=0203088352|page=116|url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=J6nXcpxXzWsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>
