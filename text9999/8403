'''Charles J. Russhon''' ([[March 23]] [[1911]] - [[June 26]] [[1982]] ) was an [[United States|American]] [[photographer]] and [[Lieutenant]] in the [[United States Air Force]] who later became noted for his role as a technical adviser and liaison officer on the [[Sean Connery]] and [[Roger Moore]] [[James Bond]] films of the 1960s and 1970s. 

He served as a [[photographer]] in [[World War II]] and was the first [[United States|American]] to photograph [[Hiroshima]] after the [[Bombing of Hiroshima|atomic bomb attack]] <ref>{{citeweb|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.htmlres=9D05E0DF123BF93BA15755C0A964948260|title=Charles J.

. He served in the China-Burma-India Theater of WWII and attained the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army Air Force]].

After the war, Russhon became interested in motion pictures and served as a technical adviser to filmmakers. He used his former position in the airforce and expertise most notably on the [[James Bond]] films enabling the producer to gain access to previously off boundary locations and equipment. In 1963 he negotiated the use of land in [[Istanbul]] from the Turkish authorities during the making of [[From Russia With Love (film)|From Russia With Love ]] and gained the rights to use [[Fort Knox]] for [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]] in 1964 using his position in the Army Air Force to allow special use in film. The producers acknowledge his help by a sign in the film at Ft Knox that reads "Welcome Gen. Russhon".

He was also an adviser on the 1965 Bond film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' and was able to supply the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the [[Disco Volante (ship)]] in the film. Russhon using his position was also able to gain access to the US Navy's still experimental Skyhook rescue system which was used to lift actors [[Sean Connery]] and [[Claudine Auger]] from the water at the end of the film.<ref>[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/tb_production.php3?t=tb&s=tb Production notes for Thunderball &mdash; MI6.co.uk]</ref>. Russhon appears in Air Force uniform in the film.

Russhon later worked on ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' in 1973.
