The '''University Ranking by Academic Performance''',<ref name=urapweb>{{cite web|title=University Ranking by Academic Performance|url=http://www.urapcenter.org/|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> abbreviated as URAP,  was developed in the Informatics Institute<ref>{{cite web|title=Middle East Technical University, Graduate School of Informatics|url=http://ii.metu.edu.tr/|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> of [[Middle East Technical University]]. Since 2010, it has been publishing annual national<ref>{{cite web|title=URAP T<U+00FC>rkiye <U+00D6>zel B<U+00F6>l<U+00FC>m<U+00FC>|url=http://tr.urapcenter.org/|language=Turkish}}</ref> and global<ref>{{cite web|title=World Ranking|url=http://www.urapcenter.org/2014/world.php?q=MS0yNTA=}}</ref> [[college and university rankings]] for top 2000 institutions.  The [[scientometrics]] measurement of URAP  is based on data  obtained from the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] via [[Web of Science]] and inCites. For global rankings, URAP employs indicators of research performance including the number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. In addition to global rankings, URAP publishes regional rankings for universities in [[Turkey]] using additional indicators such as the number of students and faculty members obtained from Center of Measuring, Selection and Placement [[<U+00D6>SYM]].

==Methodology==
URAP gathers data from international bibliometric databases such as [[Web of Science]] and InCites provided by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]]. URAP uses data of 2,500 Higher Education Institutions (HEI) with highest number of articles published. The overall score of each HEI is based on its performance over several indicators. Of 2500 selected HEIs, the top 2000 are included in the rankings published by URAP. Field based rankings are performed on 23 fields based on Australia ERA.<ref name=era>{{cite web|title=ERA 2015, Excellence in Research for Australia|url=http://www.arc.gov.au/era/era_2015/era_2015.htm|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>

===Indicators===

URAP uses 6 main indicator to measure the academic performance. These indicators are number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. The raw bibliometric data underlying URAP<U+2019>s 6 main indicators have highly skewed distribution. To address this issue, the median of the indicators have been used. The Delphi system was conducted with a group of experts to assign weighting scores to the indicators. Total score of 600 is distributed to indicators. URAP uses additional indicators for ranking universities in [[Turkey]] including  the number of students and faculty members.
The following table shows the indicators used for global rankings in URAP as of 2014.

====Number of articles====
Number of articles is used as a measure of current scientific productivity which includes articles indexed by Web of Science. This indicator covers articles, reviews and notes. The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %21.

====Citation====

Citation, as an indicator in URAP ranking, is a measure of research impact. It is scored according to the total number of citations received. The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %21.

====Total documents====
Total documents is the measure of sustainability and continuity of scientific productivity. The total document count covers all scholarly literature provided by the Web of Science database, including conference papers, reviews, letters, discussions, scripts, and journal articles. The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %10.

====Article Impact Total (AIT)====

Article Impact Total (AIT) is a measure of scientific productivity adjusted by the ratio of institution<U+2019>s Citation Per Publication (CPP) to the world CPP in 23 subject areas. The ratio of the institution's CPP and the world CPP indicates whether the institution is performing above or below the world average in that field. This ratio is multiplied by the number of publications in that field and then summed across the 23 fields, as shown in the following formula:

<math> AIT = \sum_{i=1}^{23} \Bigg[ \Bigg( \frac{CPP_i}{CPP\_{World_i}} \Bigg) * Articles_i \Bigg]    </math>

The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %18.

====Citation Impact Total (CIT)====
Citation Impact Total (CIT) is a measure of research impact corrected by the institution<U+2019>s normalized CPP with respect to the world CPP in 23 subject areas. The ratio of the institution<U+2019>s CPP and the world CPP indicates whether the institution is performing above or below the world average in that field. This ratio is multiplied by the number of citations in that field and then summed across the 23 fields, as shown in the following formula:

<math> CIT = \sum_{i=1}^{23} \Bigg[ \Bigg( \frac{CPP_i}{CPP\_{World_i}} \Bigg) * Citations_i \Bigg]  </math>

The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %15.

====International collaboration====

International Collaboration is a measure of global acceptance of the institution.  International collaboration data, which is based on the total number of published studies conducted  in collaboration with foreign universities, is obtained from InCites.  The weight of this indicator in the overall ranking is %15.

==Commentary and reception==

URAP covers considerably more institutions than other major ranking systems. In a section about URAP in  <U+201C>Where Are the Global Rankings Leading Us? An Analysis of Recent Methodological Changes and New Developments<U+201D> published in  the [[European Journal of Education]] it is mentioned that <U+201D>While it is less well-known than SRG, ARWU, THE, and QS, it is interesting because it published a list of 2000 universities, while the above rankings cover a maximum of 700 universities.<U+201D><ref name=where>{{cite journal|last1=Rauhvargers|first1=Andrejs|title=Where Are the Global Rankings Leading Us?

==Criticism==
The indicators used in URAP are absolute values and size-dependent making it biased towards larger institutions.<ref name=eua /><ref name=ireg /> 
According to the  <U+201C>EUA report on Ranking for 2013<U+201C> published by the [[European University Association]],  URAP disregards books, excludes studies in arts and humanities areas, and under-represents social sciences. Furthermore,  URAP does not employ any compensation for different publication cultures due to the lack of field-normalization of the results of bibliometric indicators. The report further states that <U+201C>The results of the indicator on citation numbers in particular, as well as those on publication counts, are thus skewed towards the natural sciences and especially medicine.<U+201D> It also states that excluding teaching indicators by URAP makes its  focus solely on research-oriented institutions.<ref name=eua />

The <U+201C>University Ranking Lists: A directory<U+201D> report  published by the Division for Analysis and Evaluation of the [[University of Gothenburg]] points out to a problem that might arise from including more than 500 institutions in the ranking system. It states that <U+201C>It [URAP] lists 2000 universities, and the purpose is to provide a ranking that covers not only institutions in the Western elite group. This purpose contrasts starply to other ranking producers<U+2019> decisions not to publish more than the 400-500 top positions of their lists, since they do not consider their methods reliable below that level. [URAP] do not comment this problem.<U+201D><ref name=gothenburg />
