The first of  what would turn out to be five compilations the band released from 1996 to 2006, ''Pure'' is almost a [[reissue]] rather than a compilation, since it consists of all but three of the songs released by the band on their first two albums, ''[[Cloudcuckooland (album)|Cloudcuckooland]]'' from 1990 and [[Sense (The Lightning Seeds album)|Sense]] from 1992; the only songs missing are one song from the first album ("Control the Flame") and two from ''Sense'': ("Where Flowers Fade" and "Marooned").<ref>{{cite web| title= The Lightning Seeds - the Albums  | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/plain/A700994 | work= Arts and Entertainment / Music / Musical Works | first= Mark |last= Moxon |date= 4 March 2002| publisher= [[h2g2]] | quote= A rushed compilation of 18 songs from the first two albums, ...[i]t misses off one song from ''Cloudcuckooland'' ("Control the Flame") and two from ''Sense'' ("Where Flowers Fade" and "Marooned")...|accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref>
