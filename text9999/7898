"'''Lemon of Troy'''" is the 24th&nbsp;episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]], and originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 14, 1995.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|page=175}}</ref> In the episode, the children of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] wage war on [[Shelbyville (The Simpsons)|Shelbyville]] after their beloved lemon tree is stolen from them by Shelbyville children. The parents of the Springfield children take [[Ned Flanders|Ned]]'s [[recreational vehicle]] (RV) to search for their boys, and when they find them, the children convince them to help recover the stolen tree from an impound lot.

It was written by [[Brent Forrester]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. For the episode, the animators designed a non-polluted version of Springfield. It features cultural references to the 1984 song "[[When Doves Cry]]" and the 1981 film ''[[Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior|Mad Max 2]]'', and the title of the episode is a play on the name [[Helen|Helen of Troy]] from [[Greek mythology]]. The episode acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 8.1.

==Plot==
When [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] catches [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] vandalizing a town sidewalk by writing his name in wet cement, she lectures him on the importance of town pride. Afterwards, Bart realizes how wonderful it is living in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Consequently, however, Bart also becomes upset with anti-Springfield sentiments coming from the neighboring town of [[Shelbyville (The Simpsons)|Shelbyville]]. [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] explains that this rivalry can be traced back to the establishment of the two towns. This occurred when the founders [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Jebediah Springfield|Jebediah Springfield]] and Shelbyville Manhattan discovered they had irreconcilable differences regarding their visions for a perfect town, Springfield favoring promotion of [[chastity]] and Shelbyville advocating [[incest]]uous marriages between [[cousin couple|cousins]].

The next day, Springfield's lemon tree is stolen by a couple of boys from Shelbyville. Taking his town pride to heart and swearing to keep it, Bart leads [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]], [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]], [[Martin Prince|Martin]], [[Flanders family#Todd|Todd]], and [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Database|Database]] into Shelbyville to search for the tree and bring it back to Springfield. The group splits up and has a few misadventures. Bart goes undercover and infiltrates the children of Shelbyville by disguising himself. However, he is unable to obtain any information. Eventually, the Springfield children track down the tree to an impound lot (where one of the boys that stole the tree lives).

Back in Springfield, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], using [[Ned Flanders]]' RV, leads the fathers to find the boys. When the two groups meet, the boys tell their fathers of the tree being stolen and that they're trying to recover it. Shocked by this, the fathers head over to the impound lot and demand the return of the tree, but the owner of the impound lot refuses and taunts them of their town heritage. Using a plan similar to the [[Trojan Horse]], Bart steers the RV to the outside of the hospital. The RV is taken to the impound lot after it is found parked outside the hospital. When night falls, the Springfieldian boys and their fathers get out of the RV and tie the tree to the top. They are caught in the middle of this act by the owner but manage to escape. The tree, though considerably damaged during the escape, is returned to Springfield. The children of Springfield celebrate with lemonade, while those in Shelbyville drink [[turnip]] juice, much to their disgust.

==Cultural references==
In the episode, Milhouse recites a slightly paraphrased line from [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s 1984 song "[[When Doves Cry]]".<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season6/page24.shtml|title=Lemon of Troy|accessdate=2008-03-28|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Bart identifies the number seven in [[Roman numerals]] by referring to a nonexistent [[sequel]] of the [[Rocky (film series)|Rocky series]], ''Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge''.<ref name=mirkin/> The scene with Bart and his team sitting on a hill above the enemy camp and looking down at the captured tree being circled by children on bicycles bears a resemblance to an early scene in ''[[Mad Max 2]]''.<ref name=reardon/>

[[File:Theprocessionofthetrojanhorseintroybygiovannidomenicotiepolo.jpg|thumb|The method of recovery of the lemon tree is reference to the legend of the [[Trojan Horse]].]]The overall plot structure of Springfield residents attacking their neighboring rivals after they steal their prize possession is a reference to the legend of the [[Trojan War]], in which the incentive for the [[Greeks]] declaring war on their Trojan neighbors is the abduction of their most famous and beautiful female citizen, [[Helen]]. The title of the episode is a play on her name. The method of recovery of the tree is an echo of the [[Trojan Horse]] (a fact lost on Homer, who gleefully exclaims that "no one in history has ever done anything ''this'' clever").<ref name=troy>{{cite news|title=Linger At A Quiet Spot And You Can Conjure Up A Hero|date=May 2, 2004|page=|publisher=''[[The Mail on Sunday]]''|author=Gareth Huw Davies}} Retrieved on September 23, 2008.</ref>. At the beginning of the episode, as Marge endeavors to lecture Bart on vandalizing a sidewalk and seeks Homer's help, Homer makes a reference to Humphrey Bogart vandalizing "That sidewalk in Hollywood".
