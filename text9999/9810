Tschaikowski (1840-1893).jpg|thumb|250px|''Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky'' by Nikolay Kuznetsov, 1893]] '''Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky'''<sup>[[#Notes |<U+2020>]]</sup> ({{lang-ru|<U+041F><U+0451><U+0442><U+0440> <U+0418><U+043B><U+044C><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0427><U+0430><U+0439><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439>}}) ({{OldStyleDateDY|7 May|1840|25 April}} <U+2013> {{OldStyleDateDY|6 November|1893|25 October}})<sup>[[#Notes |<U+2020><U+2020>]]</sup> was a Russian [[composer]] of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. He wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the current classical repertoire, including the ballets ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', the ''[[1812 Overture]]'', his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Piano Concerto]], several symphonies, and the opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''.

Born into a middle-class family, Tchaikovsky's education prepared him for a career as a civil servant, despite the musical precocity he had demonstrated from an early age. Against the wishes of his family he chose to pursue a musical career, and in 1862 entered the [[St Petersburg Conservatory]], graduating in 1865. This formal, Western-oriented training set him apart, musically, from the contemporary nationalistic movement embodied by the group of young Russian composers known as "[[The Five]]", with whom Tchaikovsky sustained a mixed professional relationship throughout his career.

As his style developed, Tchaikovsky wrote music across a range of genres, including [[symphony]], opera, ballet, instrumental, [[chamber music|chamber]] and song. Although he enjoyed many popular successes, he was never emotionally secure, and his life was punctuated by personal crises and periods of depression. Contributory factors were his suppressed homosexuality and fear of exposure, his disastrous marriage, and the sudden collapse of the one enduring relationship of his adult life, his 13-year association with the wealthy widow [[Nadezhda von Meck]]. Amid private turmoil Tchaikovsky's public reputation grew; he was honoured by the Tsar, awarded a lifetime pension and lauded in the concert halls of the world. His sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera, but some attribute it to suicide.<ref name="brhosu"/>

Although enduringly popular with concert audiences across the world, Tchaikovsky has at times been judged harshly by critics, musicians and composers.  However, his reputation as a significant composer is now generally regarded as secure,<ref name="brng6289">Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628<U+2013>29.</ref> the disdain with which Western critics in the early and mid-20th century dismissed his music  as vulgar and lacking in elevated thought having largely dissipated.<ref name="wi25169"/>

==Life==
===Childhood===
[[Image:Tchaikovskys family in 1848 From left to right sitting Alexandra Andreevna Tchaikovska Alexandra Ippolit Ilya Petrovitch Tchai Family 2.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|upright|The Tchaikovsky family in 1848. Left to right: Pyotr, Alexandra Andreevna (mother), Alexandra (sister), Ippolit, Ilya Petrovich (father)]]
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born in [[Votkinsk]], a small town in present-day [[Udmurtia]], formerly the [[Imperial Russia]]n province of [[Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]]. His father, Ilya Petrovich, was the son of a government mining engineer of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] descent. His mother, Alexandra, was of partial [[French people|French]] ancestry and was the second of Ilya's three wives. Pyotr was the elder brother (by some ten years) of the dramatist, [[librettist]], and translator [[Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].<ref>Holden, 6, 13; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 18.</ref>

In 1843 Tchaikovsky's parents hired a French governess, Fanny D<U+00FC>rbach. Her love and affection for her charge is said to have provided a counter to Alexandra, who is described by one biographer as a cold, unhappy, distant parent not given to displays of physical affection.<ref>Holden, 6.</ref> However, other writers claim that Alexandra doted on her son.<ref>Poznansky, ''Quest'', 5.</ref>

Tchaikovsky began piano lessons at the age of four. A precocious pupil, he could read music as well as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the [[School of Jurisprudence]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky would have to spend two years boarding at the School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school, {{convert|800|mi|km}} from his family.<ref>Holden, 14; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 26.</ref> Once those two years had passed, Tchaikovsky transferred to the School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.<ref>Holden, 20.</ref>

===Emerging composer===
[[Image:Uchilische pravovedenia.jpg|thumb|Modern view of the School of Jurisprudence]]

On June 25, 1854 Tchaikovsky suffered the shock of his mother Alexandra's death from [[cholera]]. He was so affected that he felt unable to inform  Fanny D<U+00FC>rbach until a further two years had passed.<ref>Brown, ''Tchaikovsky: The Early Years, 1840<U+2013>1874'' (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1978, 47; ''Tchaikovsky: The Man and His Music'' (New York: Pegasus Books, 2007), 12.; Holden, 23.; Tchaikovsky, P., ''Polnoye sobraniye sochinery: literaturn<U+00EF>ye proizvedeniya i perepiska'' [Complete edition: literary works and correspondence] In progress (Moscow, 1953<U+2013>present), 5:56<U+2013>57.; Warrack, 29.</ref> However, within a month of his mother's death he was making his first serious efforts at composition, a [[waltz]] in her memory. Several writers have claimed that the loss of his mother was formative to Tchaikovsky's sexual development, along with his experience of the allegedly widespread [[homosexual]] practices among students at the School of Jurisprudence.<ref>Holden, 22, 26.; Poznansky, ''Quest'', 32<U+2013>37.; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 30</ref> Whatever the truth of this, some friendships with fellow students, such as those with [[Aleksey Apukhtin]] and Vladimir Gerard, were intense enough to last the rest of his life.<ref>Holden, 23.</ref>
Music was not considered a high priority at the School,<ref>Holden, 24.</ref> but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students.<ref>Holden, 24; Poznansky, ''Quest'', 26</ref> He was fond of works by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 Ilya Tchaikovsky funded private lessons  with Rudolph K<U+00FC>ndinger, a well-known piano teacher from [[Nuremberg]]. Ilya also questioned K<U+00FC>ndinger about a musical career for his son. K<U+00FC>ndinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.<ref>Holden, 24<U+2013>25; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 31.</ref>

[[Image:Youngtchaik.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tchaikovsky in his teens]] Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, the lowest rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. There Tchaikovsky remained for the rest of his three-year civil service career.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 14.</ref>

In 1861, he attended classes in [[music theory]] organized by the [[Russian Musical Society]] (RMS) and taught by [[Nikolai Zaremba]]. A year later he followed Zaremba to the new [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St Petersburg Conservatory]]. Tchaikovsky would not give up his Ministry post "until I am quite certain that I am destined to be a musician rather than a civil servant."<ref>As quoted in Holden, 38<U+2013>39.</ref> From 1862 to 1865 he studied [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]] with Zaremba, while  [[Anton Rubinstein]], director and founder of the Conservatory, taught him instrumentation and composition.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 20; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 36<U+2013>38.</ref> In 1863 he abandoned his civil service career and studied music full-time, graduating in December 1865. Rubinstein was impressed by Tchaikovsky's musical talent, but this did not stop either him or Zaremba from later clashes with the young composer over his [[Symphony No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Symphony]], written after his graduation,  when he submitted it to them for their perusal.  The symphony was given its first complete performance in Moscow in February 1868, where it was well received.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:608.</ref>

===Relationship with The Five===
{{see also|Tchaikovsky and the Five}}
Rubinstein's western musical orientation brought him the opposition of the nationalistic group of musicians known as "The Five". As Rubinstein's best-known pupil, Tchaikovsky was treated as a natural target for attack by the group, especially as fodder for [[C<U+00E9>sar Cui]]'s criticism.<ref>Holden, 52.</ref> This attitude changed slightly when Rubinstein left the St. Petersburg musical scene in 1867. In 1869 Tchaikovsky entered into a working relationship with composer [[Mily Balakirev]], leader of The Five; the result was Tchaikovsky's first recognised masterpiece, the fantasy-overture ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced.<ref>Brown, ''Tchaikovsky: Man and Music'', 49.</ref> He remained friendly but never intimate with most of The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his.<ref>Maes, 49.</ref> He took pains to ensure his musical independence from them as well as from the conservative faction at the St. Petersburg Conservatory<U+2014>a course of action facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] offered to him by [[Nikolai Rubinstein]].<ref>Holden, 64.</ref>

===Mature composer===
[[File:Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky).png|thumb|Main theme of the First Piano Concerto, as played on the piano]]
Tchaikovsky combined his professorial duties with  [[Music journalism|music criticism]]<ref>Holden, 83; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 61.</ref> while continuing to compose. Some of his best-known works from this period include the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Piano Concerto]], the ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' for [[violoncello]] and orchestra, the ''Little Russian'' Symphony and the [[ballet]] ''[[Swan Lake]]''. The First Piano Concerto suffered an initial rejection by its intended dedicatee, Nikolai Rubinstein, as recounted three years later by the composer.<ref>Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 474<U+2013>75.</ref> The work was subsequently offered to pianist [[Hans von B<U+00FC>low]], whose playing had impressed Tchaikovsky during an appearance in Moscow in March 1874. B<U+00FC>low premiered the work in Boston in October 1875; Rubinstein eventually championed the work himself.<ref>Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 476.</ref>

====Homosexuality====
The writer Alexander Poznansky showed through his research that Tchaikovsky had homosexual tendencies and that some of the composer's closest relationships were with persons of the same sex. Tchaikovsky's servant Aleksei Sofronov and the composer's nephew, Vladimir "Bob" Davydov, have been cited as romantic interests.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 60, 269<U+2013>275; Holden, 80, 313<U+2013>314; Poznansky, ''Quest'', 133.</ref>

More controversial is how comfortable Tchaikovsky might have been with his sexual nature.  After reading all Tchaikovsky's letters (including unpublished ones), Poznansky concludes that the composer "eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality&nbsp;... without experiencing any serious psychological damage."<ref>As quoted in Holden, 394.</ref> Relevant portions of his brother [[Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Modest]]'s autobiography, where he tells of his brother's sexual orientation, have also been published.<ref>Poznansky, ''Tchaikovsky Through Others' Eyes'', 8, 24, 77, 82.</ref> Some letters previously suppressed by Soviet censors, where Tchaikovsky openly speaks out about his homosexuality, have been published in Russian, as well as by Poznansky in English translation.<ref>Poznansky, ''Tchaikovsky Through Others' Eyes'', 103<U+2013>105, 165<U+2013>168. Also see P.I. Chaikovskii. ''Al'manakh, vypusk 1'', (Moscow, 1995). </ref> However, biographer [[Anthony Holden]] claims British musicologist and scholar Henry Zajaczkowski's research "along psychoanalytical lines" points instead to "a severe unconscious inhibition by the composer of his sexual feelings":

<blockquote>One consequence of it may be sexual overindulgence as a kind of false solution: the individual thereby persuades himself that he does accept his sexual impulses. Complementing this and, also, as a psychological defense mechanism, would be precisely the idolization by Tchaikovsky of many of the young men of his circle [the self-styled "Fourth Suite"], to which Poznansky himself draws attention. If the composer's response to possible sexual objects was either to use and discard them or to idolize them, it shows that he was unable to form an integrated, secure relationship with another man. That, surely, was [Tchaikovsky's] tragedy.<ref>Zajaczkowski, Henry, ''The Musical Times'', cxxxiii, no. 1797, November 1992, 574. As quoted in Holden, 394.</ref></blockquote>

In the [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|second edition of the ''New Grove'']] (2001), Roland John Wiley suggests a third alternative:

<blockquote>Allowing that much remains to be learnt, Tchaikovsky's letters as we have them suggest reasonable conclusions about his sexuality. First, he experienced no unbearable guilt over it, but took its negative social implications seriously. Of special concern was the threat of allusion to it in the press, and the impact this would have on his family. That prospect made him hypersensitive and moody, and may have pressured him to marry. Second, Tchaikovsky expressed the belief that he could function in a heterosexual union even if he had to lead a double life. His willingness to marry was prompted by his father, whom he wanted to please, and would satisfy not only social convention but also his own desire for a permanent home and his love of children and family. Third, the letters and diaries make unabashed if indirect reference to romantic activity. Claims made for these references, including evidence of sexual argot and of passionate encounter, far exceed the limits of the evidence. The first, by implying Tchaikovsky's intent to conceal his sexuality, and the second, by implying that he was promiscuous, have prompted the belief that he suffered neurosis over this matter. The facts are more quodition. Tchaikovsky associated openly with the homosexuals in his circle, establishing professional connections and lifelong friendships with some of them, and sought out their company for extended periods. His mode of address was, on occasion, the very antithesis of concealment<U+2014>the expression more of humor than of secret meaning.<ref name="wiley25147">Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:147.</ref></blockquote>

Wiley adds, "Amateurish criticism to the contrary, there is no warrant to assume, this period [of his short-lived marriage] excepted, that Tchaikovsky's sexuality ever deeply impaired his inspiration, or made his music idiosyncratically confessional or incapable of philosophical utterance."<ref name="wiley25147"/>

====Turmoil in life and music====
{{see also|D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e Art<U+00F4>t|Antonina Miliukova}}
In 1868, Tchaikovsky met the Belgian soprano [[D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e Art<U+00F4>t]], then on a tour of Russia.  They became infatuated, and were engaged to be married.<ref>Brown, ''Early Years'', 156<U+2013>157.</ref> He dedicated his ''Romance in F minor'' for piano, Op. 5, to her. However, on September 15, 1868, without any communication with Tchaikovsky (as the social conventions of the time would have demanded), Art<U+00F4>t married a member of her company, the Spanish baritone [[Mariano Padilla y Ramos]]. The general view has been that Tchaikovsky got over the affair fairly quickly. It has, however, been postulated that he coded her name into the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor]] and the tone-poem [[Fatum (Tchaikovsky)|Fatum]]<ref>Brown, ''Early Years'', 197<U+2013>200.</ref> They met on a handful of later occasions, and in October 1888 he wrote ''Six French Songs'', Op.&nbsp;65, for her, in response to her request for a single song. Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved.<ref>{{cite web|title= Art<U+00F4>t, D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>e (1835<U+2013>1907)|url= http://www.schubertiademusic.com/index.php?catalog=catalog-4|publisher=  Schubertiade music|accessdate = 21 February 2009|dateformat= dmy}}</ref>

In April 1877 Tchaikovsky's favorite pupil, Vladimir Shilovsky, had married suddenly.<ref>Poznansky, 204.Pioznansky also asserts that Shilovsky was homosexual, and that he and Tchaikovsky had shared a mutual bond of affection for just over a decade.(Poznansky, 95, 126).</ref><ref>Tchaikovsky, M.I., ''Zhizn' Petra Il'icha Chaikovskoyo'' [Life of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky], 3 vols. (Moscow and Leipzig, 1900<U+2013>1902), 1:258<U+2013>259.</ref> Shilovsky's wedding may, in turn, have spurred Tchaikovsky to consider such a step himself.<ref>Poznansky, 204.</ref>  He declared his intention to marry in a letter to his brother.<ref>Letter to Modest Tchaikovsky, August 31, 1876. As quoted in Holden, 113.</ref> There followed Tchaikovsky's ill-starred marriage to one of his former composition students,  [[Antonina Miliukova]]. The brief time with his wife drove him to an emotional crisis, which was followed by a stay in [[Clarens, Switzerland]], for rest and recovery.<ref>Holden,126, 145, 148, 150.</ref> They remained legally married but never lived together again nor had any children, though she later gave birth to three children by another man.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 230, 232; Holden, 209.</ref>

Tchaikovsky's marital d<U+00E9>bacle may have forced him to face the full truth concerning his sexuality.<ref name="holden172">Holden, 172.</ref> He apparently never again considered matrimony as a camouflage or escape, nor considered himself capable of loving women in the same manner as men. <ref name="holden172"/> He wrote to his brother Anatoly from [[Florence]], [[Italy]] on February 19, 1878,

<blockquote>Thanks to the regularity of my life, to the sometimes tedious but always inviolable calm, and above all, thanks to time whch heals all wounds, I have completely recovered from my ''insanity''. There's no doubt that for some months on end I was a bit ''insane'', and only now, when I'm completely recovered, have I learned to relate ''objectively'' to everything which I did during my brief insanity. That man who in May took it into his head to marry A[ntonina] I[vanova], who during June wrote a whole opera as though nothing had happened, who in July married, who in September fled from his wife, who in November railed at Rome and so on<U+2014>that man wasn't I, but another Pyotr Ilyich.<ref>As quoted in Brown, ''Crisis Years'', 254.</ref></blockquote>

A few days later, in another letter to Anatoly, he added that there was "nothing more futile than wanting to be anything other than what I am by nature."<ref>Letter to Anatoly Tchaikovsky, February 25, 1878, as quoted in Holden, 172</ref>

The strain of the marriage may have actually enhanced Tchaikovsky's creativity. The Fourth Symphony and the opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', arguably two of his finest compositions,<ref name="brtmm143">Brown, ''Tchaikovsky: The Man and His Music'', 143.</ref> could be considered proof of this.<ref name="brtmm143"/> He finished both these works in the six months between his engagement and the completion of the rest cure following his marriage breakdown.  While in Clarens he also composed his [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]], with the technical assistance of one of his former students, violinist Yosif Kotek, who would later help establish contact between Tchaikovsky and Nadezhda von Meck, the widow of a railway magnate. She would later become the composer's patron and confidante.<ref>Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 484<U+2013>85.</ref>

Like the First Piano Concerto, the Violin Concerto was rejected initially by its intended dedicatee, in this case the noted virtuoso and pedagogue [[Leopold Auer]]. It was premiered by another soloist ([[Adolph Brodsky]]), and while the work would eventually enjoy public success, the audience hissed at its premiere in Vienna,<ref>Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 487.</ref> and it was denigrated by music critic [[Eduard Hanslick]]:

<blockquote>The Russian composer Tchaikovsky is surely no ordinary talent, but rather, an inflated one, obsessed with posturing as a man of genius, and lacking all discrimination and taste&nbsp;.... the same can be said for his new, long, and ambitious Violin Concerto. For a while it proceeds soberly, musically, and not mindlessly, but soon vulgarity gains the upper hand and dominates until the end of the first movement. The violin is no longer played: it is tugged about, torn, beaten black and blue.... The Adagio is well on the way to reconciling us and winning us over when, all too soon, it breaks off to make way for a finale that transports us to the brutal and wretched jollity of a Russian church festival. We see a host of gross and savage faces, hear crude curses, and smell the booze. In the course of a discussion of obscener illustrations, [[Friedrich Vischer]] once maintained that there were pictures whose stink one could see. Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto confronts us for the first time with the hideous idea that there may be musical compositions whose stink one can hear.<ref>Hanslick, Eduard, ''Music Criticisms 1850<U+2013>1900'', ed. and trans. Henry Pleasants (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1963). As quoted in Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 487.</ref></blockquote>

Auer belatedly accepted the concerto, and eventually played it to great public success. In future years he would teach this work to his pupils, including [[Jascha Heifetz]] and [[Nathan Milstein]]. Auer later said that Hanslick's comment that "the last movement was redolent of vodka [...] did credit neither to his good judgment nor to his reputation as a critic."<ref>As quoted in Steinberg, ''Concerto'', 486.</ref>

[[Image:Hans von buelow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hans von B<U+00FC>low became a fervent champion of Tchaikovsky's music.]]
The intensity of personal emotion now flowing through Tchaikovsky's works was entirely new to Russian music.<ref name = "volkovsp115"/> It prompted some Russian commentators to place his name alongside that of novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].<ref name = "volkovsp115"/> Like Dostoyevsky's characters, they felt the musical hero in Tchaikovsky's music persisted in exploring the meaning of life while trapped in a fatal love-death-faith triangle.<ref name="volkovsp115">Volkov, 115.</ref> The critic Osoovski wrote of Tchaikovsky and Dostoyevsky: "With a hidden passion they both stop at moments of horror, total spiritual collapse, and finding acute sweetness in the cold trepidation of the heart before the abyss, they both force the reader to experience those feelings, too."<ref name="volkov116">Osoovskii, A.V., ''Muzykal'no-kritcvheskie stat'i, 1894<U+2013>1912'' (Musical Criticism articles, 189401912) (Leningrad, 1971), 171. As quoted in Volkov, 116.</ref>

Tchaikovsky's fame among concert audiences began to expand outside Russia, and continued to grow within it. Hans von B<U+00FC>low had become a fervent champion of the composer's work after hearing some of it in a Moscow concert during Lent of 1874.<ref name="wiley25161"/> In a German newspaper later that year, he praised the [[String Quartet No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|First String Quartet]], ''Romeo and Juliet'' and other works, and he would later take up many other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor.<ref name="wiley25161"/> In France, Camille Benoit began introducing Tchaikovsky's music to readers of the ''Revue et gazette musicale de Paris''. The music also received significant exposure during the 1878 International Exhibition in Paris. While Tchaikovsky's reputation as a composer grew, a corresponding increase in performances of his works did not occur until he began conducting them himself, starting in the mid-1880s.<ref name="wiley25161">Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:161.</ref> Nevertheless, by 1880, all of the operas Tchaikovsky had completed up that point had been staged, and his orchestral works had been given performances that had been sympathetically received.<ref>Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky Symphonies and Concertos'', 28.</ref>

====Nadezhda von Meck====
{{see also|Nadezhda von Meck}}
Nadezhda von Meck was the wealthy widow of a Russian railway tycoon and an influential patron of the arts. Having heard of Tchaikovsky through Kotek, she wanted to commission some chamber pieces from him. Her support became an important element in Tchaikovsky's life; she eventually paid him an annual subsidy of 6,000 [[Russian ruble|ruble]]s, which made it possible for him to resign from the Moscow Conservatory in October 1878 and concentrate on composition.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 171<U+2013>172.</ref>  With von Meck's patronage came a relationship that, at her insistence, was mainly epistolary <U+2013> she stipulated they were never to meet face to face. They exchanged well over 1,000 letters between 1877 and 1890. In these letters Tchaikovsky was more open  about much of his life and his creative processes than he had been to any other person.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 134; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 108, 130<U+2013>33.</ref>

As well as being a dedicated supporter of Tchaikovsky's musical works, von Meck  became a vital enabler in his day-to-day existence.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 134.</ref> As he explained to her,

<blockquote>There is something so special about our relationship that it often stops me in my tracks with amazement. I have told you more than once, I believe, that you have come to seem to me the hand of Fate itself, watching over me and protecting me. The very fact that I do not know you personally, while feeling so close to you, accords you in my eyes the special status of an unseen but benevolent presence, like a benign Providence.<ref>Letter to von Meck, January 21, 1878. As quoted in Holden, 159.</ref></blockquote>

In 1884 Tchaikovsky and von Meck became related by marriage when one of her sons, Nikolay, married Tchaikovsky's niece Anna Davydova.<ref>Holden, 231<U+2013>32.</ref> However, in 1890 von Meck suddenly ended the relationship.  She was suffering from health problems that made writing difficult; there were family pressures, and also financial difficulties arising from the mismanagement of her estate by her son Vladimir.<ref>Holden, 289</ref>  The break with Tchaikovsky was announced in a letter delivered by a trusted servant, rather than by the usual postal service. It contained a request that he not forget her, and was accompanied by a year's subsidy in advance. She claimed bankruptcy, which, if not literally true, was evidently a real threat at the time.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 384<U+2013>86; Holden, 289; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 241.</ref>

Tchaikovsky may have been aware for nearly a year of his patroness's financial difficulties.<ref name="holden292"/> This did not stop him from continuing to take his allowance for granted (with regular protestations of his eternal gratitude), nor did he offer to return the advance he had received with the farewell letter. Despite his growing celebrity throughout Europe, von Meck's allowance still made up a third of the composer's income.<ref name="holden292">Holden, 292.</ref> While he may have no longer needed her money as much as in the past, the loss of her friendship and encouragement was devastating; he remained bewildered and resentful about her abrupt disappearance for the remaining three years of his life.<ref>Brown, ''Final Years'', 287<U+2013>289; Holden, 293; Poznansky, 521, 526; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 242.</ref>

===Years of wandering===
[[File:Alexander III. Czar Of Russia Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tsar Alexander III of Russia, who remained a devotee of Tchaikovsky's music, conferred an award and a lifelong pension to the composer.]]
Tchaikovsky returned to Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879, having been away from Russia for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. However, he quickly resigned, settling in Kamenka yet travelling incessantly.<ref name="brmm219"/> During these years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he wandered around Europe and rural Russia, never staying long in any one place and living mainly alone, avoiding social contact whenever possible.<ref name="brmm219">Brown, ''Man and Music'', 219.</ref> This may have been due in part to troubles with Antonina, who would alternately agree to, then refuse, divorce, at one point exacerbating matters by moving into an apartment directly above her husband's.<ref name = "browngrove619"/>  Tchaikovsky listed Antonina's accusations to him in detail to Modest: "I am a deceiver who married her in order to hide my true nature&nbsp;... I insulted her every day, her sufferings at my hands were great&nbsp;... she is appalled by my shameful vice, etc., etc."  It is possible that he lived the rest of his life in dread of Antonina's power to expose publicly his sexual leanings.<ref>Holden, 155</ref> These factors may explain why, except for the [[Piano Trio (Tchaikovsky)|piano trio]] which he wrote upon the death of [[Nikolai Rubinstein]], his best work from this period is found in genres which did not depend heavily on personal expression.<ref name="browngrove619">Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:619.</ref>

While Tchaikovsky's reputation grew rapidly outside Russia, it was, as [[Alexandre Benois]] wrote in his memoirs, "considered obligatory [in progressive musical circles in Russia] to treat Tchaikovsky as a renegade, a master overly dependent on the West."<ref name = "volkovsp126"/> In 1880 this assessment changed, practically overnight. During commemoration ceremonies for the [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] Monument in Moscow, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] charged that the poet had given a prophetic call to Russia for "universal unity" with the West.<ref name="volkovsp126">Volkov, 126.</ref> An unprecedented acclaim for Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, and disdain for Tchaikovsky's music dissipated. He even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of St. Petersburg, including Benois, [[L<U+00E9>on Bakst]] and [[Sergei Diaghilev]].<ref>Volkov, ''St. Petersburg'', 122<U+2013>123.</ref>

[[File:Cathedral of Christ the Saviour 1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Moscow in 1903.]]
In 1880 the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], commissioned by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to commemorate the defeat of Napoleon in 1812, was nearing completion in Moscow; the 25th anniversary of the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] would be at hand in 1881;<sup>[[#Notes |<U+2020><U+2020><U+2020>]]</sup> and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition was in the planning stage. Nikolai Rubinstein suggested a grand commemorative piece for use in related festivities. Tchaikovsky began the project in October 1880, finishing it within six weeks. He wrote to von Meck that the resulting work, the ''[[1812 Overture]]'', would be "very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it."<ref name="brwa119">As quoted in Brown, ''Wandering'', 119.</ref> He also warned conductor [[Eduard N<U+00E1>pravn<U+00ED>k]] that "I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts."<ref name="brwa119"/> Nevertheless, this work has become for many, as Tchaikovsky authority Dr. David Brown phrased it, "the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best."<ref name="brmm224"">Brown, ''Man and Music'', 224.</ref>

On March 23, 1881, Nikolai Rubinstein died in Paris. Tchaikovsky was holidaying in Rome, and he went immediately to attend the funeral in Paris for his greatly respected mentor, but arrived too late (although he was part of a group of people who saw Rubinstein's coffin off on a train back to Russia).<ref>Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 172</ref>  In December, he started work on his [[Piano Trio (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Trio in A minor]], "dedicated to the memory of a great artist."<ref>As quoted in Brown, ''Wandering'', 151.</ref> The trio was first performed privately at the Moscow Conservatory, where Rubinstein had been director, on the first anniversary of his death by three of its staff<U+2014>pianist [[Sergei Taneyev]], violinist [[Jan H<U+0159><U+00ED>mal<U+00FD>]] and cellest [[Wilhelm Fitzenhagen]].<ref>Brown, ''Wandering'', 151.</ref> The piece became extremely popular during the composer's lifetime and, in an ironic twist of fate, would become Tchaikovsky's own elegy when played at memorial concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg in November 1893.<ref>Brown, ''Wandering'', 152.</ref>

===Return to Russia===
During 1884 Tchaikovsky began to shed his unsociability and restlessness. In March of that year [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] conferred upon him the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] (fourth class), which carried with it [[Russian nobility|hereditary nobility]]. The tsar's decoration was a visible seal of official approval, that helped Tchaikovsky's social rehabilitation.<ref name="browngrove621">Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:621.</ref> This rehabilitation may have been cemented in the composer's mind with the extreme success of his [[Orchestral Suite No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Third Orchestral Suite]] at its January 1885 premiere in St. Petersburg, under [[Hans von B<U+00FC>low]]'s direction.<ref name="brmm275"/> Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda von Meck: "I have never seen such a triumph. I saw the whole audience was moved, and grateful to me. These moments are the finest adornments of an artist's life. Thanks to these it is worth living and laboring."<ref>As quoted in Brown, ''Man and Music'', 275.</ref> The press was likewise unanimously favorable.<ref name="brmm275">Brown, ''Man and Music'', 275.</ref>

[[File:<U+0414><U+043E><U+043C>-<U+043C><U+0443><U+0437><U+0435><U+0439> <U+041F>. <U+0418>. <U+0427><U+0430><U+0439><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E>.jpg|thumb|Tchaikovsky's last home, in Klin, now the Tchaikovsky Museum.]]
In 1885, Tchaikovsky resettled in Russia. The Tsar asked personally for a new production of ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' to be staged in St. Petersburg. The opera had previously been seen only in Moscow, produced by a student ensemble from the Conservatory. Though critical reception to the St. Petersburg production of ''Onegin'' was negative, the opera drew full houses every night; 15 years later the composer's brother Modest identified this as the moment Tchaikovsky became known and appreciated by the masses, achieving the greatest degree of popularity ever accorded to a Russian composer. News of the opera's success spread, and the work was produced by opera houses throughout Russia and abroad.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 282.</ref>

A feature of the St. Petersburg production of ''Onegin'' was that Alexander III requested that the opera be staged not at the [[Mariinsky Theatre|Mariyinsky Theater]] but at the [[Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre|Bolshoi Kamenn<U+00EF>y Theater]]. This served notice that Tchaikovsky's music was replacing [[Italian opera]] as the official imperial art. In addition, thanks to [[Ivan Vsevolozhsky]], Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime pension of 3,000 rubles per year from the Tsar. This essentially made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in actual title.<ref>Maes, 140.</ref>

January 1887 marked Tchaikovsky's debut as a guest conductor, substituting at the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Theater]] in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera ''[[Cherevichki]]''.<ref>Holden, 261; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 197.</ref> Within a year he was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome a life-long [[glossophobia|stage fright]] and boosted his self-assurance.<ref>Holden, 266; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 232.</ref> He wrote to von Meck, "Would you now recognize in this Russian musician traveling across Europe that man who, only a few years ago, had absconded from life in society and lived in seclusion abroad or in the country!!!"<ref>As quoted in Brown, ''Tchaikovsky: The Man and His Music'', 329.</ref> In 1888 he conducted the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)|Fifth Symphony]] in St. Petersburg, repeating the work a week later with the premiere of his tone poem ''[[Hamlet (Tchaikovsky)|Hamlet]]''. While both works were received with extreme enthusiasm by audiences, critics proved hostile, with [[C<U+00E9>sar Cui]] calling the symphony "routine" and "meretricious."<ref>Holden, 272.</ref> Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky continued to conduct the symphony in Russia and Europe.<ref>Holden, 273.</ref> Conducting brought him to America in 1891, where he led the [[New York Symphony Orchestra|New York Music Society's]] [[orchestra]] in his ''[[Marche Slave]]'' at the inaugural concert of [[New York City|New York's]] [[Carnegie Hall]]. In 1893, the [[University of Cambridge]] in Britain awarded Tchaikovsky an honorary [[Doctor of Music]] degree.<ref>Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky'', 264.</ref>

===Death===
{{see also|Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky}}
[[Image:P3264416 tchaikovsky lg.jpg|upright|thumb|Tchaikovsky's tomb at the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]]]]
Tchaikovsky died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893, nine days after the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Sixth Symphony]], the ''Path<U+00E9>tique''. He was interred in [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, near the graves of fellow-composers [[Alexander Borodin]], [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Mily Balakirev]] and [[Modest Mussorgsky]].<ref>Brown, ''Final Years'', 487.</ref> Because of the ''Path<U+00E9>tique's'' formal innovation and the overwhelming emotional content of its outer movements, the work was received by the public with silent incomprehension at its first performance.<ref>Holden, 351.</ref> The second performance, led by N<U+00E1>pravn<U+00ED>k, took place 20 days later at a memorial concert<ref>Steinberg, 635.</ref> and was much more favorably received.<ref>Holden, 371.</ref> The ''Path<U+00E9>tique'' has since become one of Tchaikovsky's best known works.

Tchaikovsky's death has traditionally been attributed to [[cholera]], most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier.<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 431<U+2013>32; Holden, 371; Warrack, ''Tchaikovsky, 269<U+2013>270.</ref> However, some have theorized that his death was  suicide. According to one variation of the theory, a sentence of suicide was imposed in a "court of honor" by Tchaikovsky's fellow alumni of the St. Petersburg School of Jurisprudence, as a censure of the composer's homosexuality. This theory was first broached publicly by Russian musicologist Alexandra Orlova in 1979, when she emigrated to the West.<ref name="brhosu">Brown, ''Man and Music'', 431<U+2013>35; Holden, 373<U+2013>400.</ref> Wiley writes in the ''New Grove'' (2001), "The polemics over [Tchaikovsky's] death have reached an empasse ... Rumor attached to the famous die hard ... As for illness, problems of evidence offer little hope of satisfactory resolution: the state of diagnosis; the confusion of witnesses; disregard of long-term effects of smoking and alcohol. We do not know how Tchaikovsky died. We may never find out...."<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:169.</ref>

==Music==
{{see also|List of compositions by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Symphonies by Tchaikovsky}}
[[Image:Sleeping beauty cast.jpg|thumb|left|Original cast of Tchaikovsky's ballet, ''The Sleeping Beauty'', Saint Petersburg, 1890]]
Tchaikovsky wrote many works which are popular with the classical music public, including his ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', the ''[[1812 Overture]]'', his three ballets (''[[The Nutcracker]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'') and ''[[Slavonic March|Marche Slave]]''. These, along with two of his four [[concerto]]s, three of his six numbered [[symphony|symphonies]] and, of his 10 operas, ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' and ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'', are probably among his most familiar works. Almost as popular are the [[Manfred Symphony|''Manfred'' Symphony]], ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Tchaikovsky)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', the ''[[Capriccio Italien]]'' and the [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky)|Serenade for Strings]]. His three [[string quartet]]s and [[piano trio]] all contain beautiful passages, while recitalists still perform  some of his 106 songs.<ref>Schonberg, 367.</ref> Tchaikovsky also wrote over a hundred piano works, covering the entire span of his creative life. Brown has asserted that "while some of these can be challenging technically, they are mostly charming, unpretentious compositions intended for amateur pianists."<ref>Brown, ''Man and Music'', 118.</ref> He adds, however, that "there is more attractive and resourceful music in some of these pieces than one might be inclined to expect."<ref>Brown, ''The Final Years'', 408.</ref>

===Creative range===
Tchaikovsky's formal conservatory training allowed him to write works with Western oriented attitudes and techniques. His music showcases a wide range and breadth of technique, from a poised "Classical" form simulating 18th century [[Rococo]] elegance, to a style more characteristic of Russian nationalists, or (according to Brown) a musical idiom expressly to channel his own overwrought emotions.<ref>Brown, ''New Grove'', 18:606.</ref> Despite his reputation as a "weeping machine,"<ref name="schonberg367">Schonberg, 367.</ref> self-expression was not a central principle for Tchaikovsky. In a letter to von Meck dated December 5, 1878, he explained there were two kinds of inspiration for a symphonic composer, a subjective and an objective one, and that [[program music]] could and should exist, just as it was impossible to demand that literature make do without the epic element and limit itself to lyricism alone. Correspondingly, the large scale orchestral works Tchaikovsky composed can be divided into two categories<U+2014>symphonies in one category, and other works such as [[symphonic poem]]s in the other.<ref>Wood, 75.</ref> According to musicologist Francis Maes, program music such as ''Francesca da Rimini'' or the ''Manfred''  Symphony was as much a part of the composer's artistic credo as the expression of his "lyric ego."<ref name="maes154">Maes, 154.</ref> Maes also identifies a group of compositions which fall outside the dichotomy of program music versus "lyrical ego," where he hearkens toward pre-Romantic aesthetics. Works in this group include the four orchestral suites, ''Capriccio Italien'', the Violin Concerto and the Serenade for Strings.<ref>Maes, 154<U+2013>155.</ref>

===Reception and reputation===
Although Tchaikovsky's music has always been popular with audiences, it has at times been judged harshly by musicians and composers.  However, his reputation as a significant composer is now generally regarded as secure.<ref name="brng6289">Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628<U+2013>29.</ref> His music has won a significant following among concert audiences that is second only to the music of Beethoven,<ref name="wi25169">Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:169.</ref> thanks in large part to what Harold C. Schonberg terms "a sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of melody ... touched with neuroticism, as emotional as a scream from a window on a dark night."<ref>Schonberg, 366.</ref> According to Wiley, this combination of supercharged melody and surcharged emotion polarized listeners, with popular appeal of Tchaikovsky's music counterbalanced by critical disdain of it as vulgar and lacking in elevated thought or philosophy.<ref name="wi25169"/> More recently, Tchaikovsky's music has received a professional reevaluation, with musicians reacting more favorably to its tunefulness and craftsmanship.<ref name="schonberg367"/>

===Public considerations===
Tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in The Five. He shared several of their ideals, including an emphasis on national character in music. His aim, however, was to link those ideals to a standard high enough to satisfy Western European criteria. His professionalism also fueled his desire to reach a broad public, not just nationally but internationally, which he would eventually do.<ref>Maes (2002), 73.</ref>

He may also have been influenced by the almost "eighteenth-century" patronage prevalent in Russia at the time, which was still strongly influenced by its aristocracy.  In this style of patronage, the patron and the artist often met on equal terms. Dedications of works to patrons were not gestures of humble gratitude but expressions of artistic [[partnership]]. The dedication of the Fourth Symphony to von Meck is known to be a seal on their friendship. Tchaikovsky's relationship with Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich bore creative fruit in the Six Songs, Op. 63, for which the grand duke wrote the words.<ref>Maes, 139<U+2013>141.</ref> Tchaikovsky found no aesthetic conflict in playing to the tastes of his audiences, though it was never established that he satisfied any other tastes but his own. The patriotic themes and stylization of 18th-century melodies in his works lined up with the values of the Russian aristocracy.<ref>Maes, 137.</ref>

According to Brown in the ''New Grove'' (1980), Tchaikovsky's melodies ranged "from Western style to folksong stylizations and occasionally folksongs themselves."<ref name="Brown, New Grove, 18:628">Brown, ''New Grove (1980)'', 18:628.</ref> His use of repetitions within these melodies generally reflect the [[Sequence (music)|sequential]] style of Western practices, which he sometimes extended at immense length, building "into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity."<ref name="Brown, New Grove, 18:628"/> He experimented occasionally with unusual meters, although more usually, as in his dance tunes, he employed a firm, essentially regular meter that "sometimes becomes the main expressive agent in some movements due to its vigorous use."<ref name="Brown, New Grove, 18:628"/> Tchaikovsky also practiced a wide range of harmony, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the [[whole tone scale]] in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony; the latter was a practice more typically used by The Five.<ref name="Brown, New Grove, 18:628"/> Since Tchaikovsky wrote most of his music for the orchestra, his musical textures became increasingly conditioned by the orchestral colors he employed, especially after the [[Orchestral Suite No. 2 (Tchaikovsky)|Second Orchestral Suite]]. Brown maintains that while the composer was grounded in Western orchestral practices, he "preferred bright and sharply differentiated orchestral coloring in the tradition established by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]."<ref name="Brown, New Grove, 18:628"/> He tends to exploit primarily the treble instruments for their "fleet delicacy,"<ref name="Brown, New Grove, 18:628"/> though he balances this tendency with "a matching exploration of the darker, even gloomy sounds of the bass instruments."<ref name="Brown, New Grove, 18:628"/>

===Impact===
Wiley cites Tchaikovsky as "the first composer of a new Russian type, fully professional, who firmly assimilated traditions of Western European symphonic mastery; in a deeply original, personal and national style he unified the symphonic thought of Beethoven and Schumann with the works of Glinka, and transformed Liszt's and Berlioz's achievements in [[program music|depictive-programmatic music]] into matters of Shakespearian elevation and psychological import."<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:144.</ref>

Tchaikovsky felt his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his colleagues in "The Five." He shared several of their ideals, including an emphasis on national character in music. His aim, however, was linking those ideals with a professional standard for structural perfection high enough to satsify European criteria.<ref name="maes73"/> Holden maintains that Tchaikovsky was the first legitimate ''professional'' Russian composer, stating that only traditions of folksong and music for the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] existed before Tchaikovsky's birth. Holden continues, "Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into [[20th century music]].  Between these two very different worlds Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge."<ref>Holden, xxi.</ref>

Tchaikovsky's professionalism also fueled his desire to reach a broad public, not just nationally but also internationally. He eventually reached just such an audience.<ref name="maes73">Maes, 73.</ref> Russian musicologist [[Solomon Volkov]] maintains that Tchaikovsky was perhaps the first Russian composer to think seriously about his country's place in European musical culture.<ref>Volkov, Solomon, ''St. Petersburg: A Cultural History'' (New York: The Free Press, A Division of Simon & Schuster, Inc., 1995)126.</ref>  As the composer wrote to von Meck from Paris,

<blockquote>How pleasant it is to be convinced firsthand of the success of our literature in France. Every book ''<U+00E9>talage'' displays translations of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]].... The newspapers are constantly printing rapturous articles about one or another of these writers. Perhaps such a time will come for Russian music as well!<ref>Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich, ''Polnoe sobranie sochinenii. Literaturnye proizvedeniia i perepiska'' (Complete Collected Works. Literary Works and Correspondence), vol 13 (Moscow, 1971), 349. As quoted in Volkov, 126.</ref></blockquote>

Tchaikovsky became the first Russian composer to personally acquaint foreign audiences with his own works, as well as those of other Russian composers.<ref>Warrack, 209</ref> He also formed close business and personal ties with many of the leading musicians of Europe and the United States. For Russians, Volkov asserts, this was all something new and unusual.<ref>Volkov, 126</ref>

Finally, the impact of Tchaikovsky's own works, especially in ballet, cannot be underestimated; his mastery of ''danseuse'' (melodies which match physical movements perfectly), along with vivid orchestration, effective themes and continuity of thought were unprecedented in the genre,<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:152<U+2013>153.</ref> setting new standards for the role of music in classical ballet.<ref name="goodwin5205">Goodwin, ''New Grove (1980)'', 5:205.</ref> Noel Goodwin characterized ''Swan Lake'' as "one of [ballet's] enduring masterworks"<ref name="goodwin5205"/> and ''The Sleeping Beauty'' as "the supreme example of 19th century classical ballet,"<ref>Goodwin, ''New Grove (1980)'', 5:206<U+2013>207.</ref> while Wiley called the latter work "powerful, diverse and rhythmically complex."<ref>Wiley, ''New Grove (2001)'', 25:165.</ref>
