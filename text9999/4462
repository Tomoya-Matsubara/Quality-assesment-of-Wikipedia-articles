'''Fisheries Research Services''' (FRS) was an [[List of Scottish Executive agencies|Executive Agency]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. FRS was responsible for scientific and technical research into the marine and freshwater [[Scottish fisheries|fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]], and the protection of the aquatic [[Ecosystem|environment]] in [[Scotland]]. For these purposes, the agency had two fishery [[laboratories]], allowing specialisation in both marine and freshwater fisheries. The FRS also maintained two research vessels. 

On April 1 2009, Fisheries Research Services was merged with the [[Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency]] and the Scottish Government Marine Directorate to form Marine Scotland, part of the core Scottish Government. <ref> [http://www.frs-scotland.gov.uk/ Former FRS website] </ref>

==Structure==
The [[FRS Marine Laboratory|marine laboratory]] is based in Victoria Road, Aberdeen; and the freshwater laboratory is based in [[Pitlochry]], [[Perth and Kinross]]. The Agency also maintained other temporary research sites throughout Scotland. The Agency also had two [[research vessel]]s, the FRV ''Scotia'' and the [[FRV Alba Na Mara|FRV ''Alba Na Mara'']].

The Agency was directly funded by the Scottish Government, which made up around 60% of income. The other 40% was derived from research income for projects carried out in conjunction with other [[government bodies]] in [[Europe]]. The Agency also worked with private firms.
