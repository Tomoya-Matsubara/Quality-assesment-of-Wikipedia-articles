[[Advance Publications]]|first=Roger|last=LeLeivre|date=June 18, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}</ref> [[Booth Newspapers]]' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, "The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyonce's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyonce. There wasn't much in the way of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?".<ref name="mlive" /> He concluded that the length of the show was "perfect" as it "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome".<ref name="mlive" /> LeLeivre finished his review by writing, "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyonce's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage".<ref name="mlive" /> Claudia La Rocco of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described his re-enactment as "absurdly faithful" and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as "smart or touching" without the dancing of Rawls and Montes.<ref name="reenact" /> She further put the performance in her list of the "richest" moments of 2008 and noted, "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud."<ref name="reenact">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/arts/dance/21laro.html?_r=0|title=Perhaps Not Fully Polished, but Jewels Nonetheless|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|first=Claudia|last=La Rocco|date=December 21, 2008|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}</ref>
