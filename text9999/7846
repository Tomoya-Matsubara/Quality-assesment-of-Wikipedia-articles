The '''Breguet 19''' (Breguet XIX, Br.19 or Bre.19) was a [[light bomber]] and [[reconnaissance plane]], also used for long-distance flights, designed by the [[France|French]] [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]] company and produced from [[1924]]. 

==Development==
The Breguet 19 was designed as a successor to a highly-successful [[World War I]] light bomber, the [[Breguet 14]]. Initially it was designed to be powered with two [[Bugatti]] engines, driving one four-bladed propeller, and such a prototype was shown on the 7th [[Paris Air Show]] in November, [[1921]]. A new design was flown in March, [[1922]], featuring a conventional layout with a single 450 hp Renault 12Kb inline engine. The aircraft was built in a [[biplane]] [[planform]], with shorter lower wings. After trials, the Breguet 19 was ordered by the [[French Air Force]] in September [[1923]].

The first eleven Breguet 19 prototypes were powered by a number of different engines. A "trademark" of Breguet was the wide usage of [[duralumin]] as a construction material, instead of steel or wood. At that time, the aircraft was faster than other bombers, and even some [[fighter aircraft]]. Therefore, it met with a huge interest in the world, strengthened by its sporting successes. Mass production, for the French Air Force and export, started in [[France]] in [[1924]]. 

== Design ==
The Br 19 was a [[biplane]] ([[sesquiplane]]), conventional in layout, with braced wings. The fuselage, ellipsoid in cross-section, was a frame of [[duralumin]] pipes. The front part was covered with duralumin sheets, the tail with [[canvas]]. The wings were canvas covered. It had a conventional fixed [[landing gear]], with rear skid. The crew of two, pilot and  observer/bombardier, sat in [[tandem]] in open [[cockpit]]s, with dual controls. 

There were used many different engines fitted, mostly water cooled 12-cylinder [[inline engine (aviation)|inline engine]]s :
* Renault 12Kb (450 hp), 12Kd (480 hp) - [[V12]]
* [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] 12Db (400 hp) - V12
* Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb (450 hp) -  [[W12]]
* [[Hispano-Suiza]] 12Ha (450 hp), 12Hb (500 hp) - V12
* Farman 12W (500 hp).
* [[Gnome-Rh<U+00F4>ne 9A]]b Jupiter (420 hp) ([[radial engine]], in Yugoslav aircraft)

They carried 365 litres of fuel in a fuselage tank. The [[propeller]] was wood.

A fixed 7.7 mm [[Vickers machine gun]] with [[interrupter gear]] was operated by the pilot, while the observer had twin 7.7 mm [[Lewis gun|Lewis]] machine guns. There was also a fourth machine gun, which could be fired by the observer downwards through an opening in a floor. According to some sources, the '''C2''' and '''CN2''' fighter variants were fitted with two pilot's machine guns. The bomber variant could carry up to 472 kg of [[bomb]]s under the fuselage, or in a vertical [[bomb bay]] (small bombs up to 50 kg). The reconnaissance variant could carry twelve 10 kg bombs. The reconnaissance variant had a [[camera]] mounting, which was optional on the bomber variant. All variants had [[radio]].

==Variants==
* '''Br.19.01'''
Br.19.01 was the first Breguet 19 prototype which first flew in March 1922.
* '''Br.19.02'''
One evatuation aircraft built for [[Yugoslavia]].
* '''Br.19 A2''' 
Two-seat [[reconnaissance plane]].
* '''Br.19 B2''' 
Two-sea [[light bomber]] biplane.
These first two variants were the most numerous, and were practically identical. They used a variety of engines, the most popular being the 400 hp Lorraine-Dietrich 12Db inline [[V engine|V12]], the 450 hp Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb [[W engine|W12]], the Renault 12K, and some models of Hispano-Suiza engines.
* '''Br.19 C2''' [[heavy fighter]] and '''Br.19 CN2''' [[night fighter]]
The same aircraft in different roles, it was almost identical to the B2 reconnaissance variant (according to some sources, it had only one additional machine gun). In the early 1930s, some French versions were refitted with Farman 12W engines.
* '''Br.19 GR'''
A special long-distance sport variant built in France in 1925 and equipped with a large fuel tank of 1,994 litres. A similar modification was carried out in Belgium. Four French Br.19 GR of [[1926]] underwent further modification. They had 2,920 litre fuel tanks fitted in the fuselage, and the cockpit was moved slightly aft. They also had their wingspan increased from 14.83 to 15.9 metres. These and another sport variants used more powerful 500 to 600 hp engines.
* '''Br 19 TR Bidon'''
Built in [[1927]] with a 3,735 litre fuel tank in a thicker and aerodynamically refined fuselage. With an additional fuel tank in the wing, the total fuel capacity was 4,125 litres. Five were built by Breguet and two by the Spanish company [[CASA]] (some publications give lower numbers of aircraft built, or different fuel capacity). 
* '''Br 19 Super Bidon'''
The last and most advanced long-distance variant,  built in [[1929]], and designed for [[transatlantic flight]]. It had a 5,180 litre fuel tank (later 5,580 litres), a modified fuselage, and a wing span of 18.3 metres. It was powered by a 600 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Lb engine (later upgraded to 650 hp). A single model was built in France, and another, with a closed canopy, was built in Spain in 1933.
* '''Br.19ter'''
Utilizing the experience with long-distance variants, this improved reconnaissance variant was developed in 1928 (there is no positive information on its eventual service) for export purposes.
* '''Br.19.7'''
The most popular of the late variants developed in [[1930]] with a 600 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Nb engine, giving a maximum speed of 242 km/h. The first five machines were converted in France for [[Yugoslavia]], then a number were built in Yugoslavia, and a further fifty built in France for export to Turkey.
* '''Br.19.8'''
With a 780 hp [[Wright Cyclone]] GR-1820-F-56 radial engine, forty-eight Br.19.7 [[airframe]]s were eventually completed as Br.19.8's in Yugoslavia. Their maximum  speed was 279 km/h.
* '''Br.19.9'''
A single prototype developed in Yugoslavia with a 860 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine.
* '''Br.19.10'''
A single prototype developed in Yugoslavia with a 720 hp Lorraine-Dietrich 12Hfrs Petrel engine.
* '''Br.19 hydro'''
Fitted with twin floats as a seaplane, probably only one prototype was produced for France (some sources claim a second one was made for Japan). Also known as the '''Breguet 19 seaplane'''.

Some modified civilian variants of the Breguet 19 were also developed: 
* '''Br.19T''' 
A six-seat prototype passenger plane with a thicker fuselage. 

Further passenger variants with a totally rebuilt fuselage were designated :
* '''Br.26T''' ([[1926]])
* '''Br.280T'''
* '''Br.281T''' 
* '''Br.284T''' 
These were used in limited numbers in France and Spain.

In total, more than 2,000 Breguet 19's were manufactured in France, and about 700 license-built by Spanish CASA, Belgian SABCA and the Yugoslavian factory in Kraljevo.

The first nineteen aircraft were imported, the next twenty-six completed from French parts, then 177 were manufactured (fifty of them had Hispano-Suiza engine, the rest the Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb engine). The Breguet 19 was the basic equipment of Spanish bomber and reconnaissance units until the initial period of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In July 1936 there were 135 in service. They were actively used as bombers during the war, especially on the government (Republican) side. In [[1936]], the Nationalists bought an additional twenty from Poland. With an advent of more modern fighters, the Br.19 suffered many losses, and in after 1937 were withdrawn from frontline service. The Republican side lost 28 aircraft, and Nationalists lost 10 (including 2 Republican and 1 Nationalist aircraft, that deserted). The remaining aircraft were used for training until [[1940]].

;{{flagicon|Yugoslavia|kingdom}} [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]
*[[Yugoslav Royal Air Force]] bought 100 Br.19 A2's in [[1924]], and in [[1927]] acquired a license to manufacture them in a new factory in [[Kraljevo]]. The first batch of eighty-five aircraft were assembled from French parts, and a further 215 were built from scratch. The first 150 aircraft in Yugoslavian service had Lorraine-Dietrich engines, the next 150 - 500 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Hb engines, and the last 100 - 420 hp Gnome-Rhone Jupiter 9Ab radial engines. From [[1932]], the Br.19.7 variant was manufactured - the first five were built in France, the next 75 in Kraljevo (51 according to other publications), and a further 48 aircraft, lacking engines, were completed in [[1935]]-[[1937]] as Br.19.8's, with 780 hp [[Wright Cyclone]]  radial engines. (Some publications give different numbers of Yugoslavian Bre.19's). Some of these Yugoslavian aircraft were used in combat after the [[Operation Marita|German attack on Yugoslavia]] in [[1941]].
;{{YUG}}
*[[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]] operated one Croatian Br.19 taken by its pilot and delivered to the partisans of [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], and used in June-July 1942, until it was shot down. Another two, captured by the new Communist government forces in April [[1945]], were used to pursue [[Ustashe]]s.

==Sports Variants ==
Both standard and modified Breguet 19s were used for numerous record-breaking flights. The first was the Br.19 prototype, which won a military aircraft speed contest in Madrid on [[17 February]], [[1923]]. On [[12 March]], [[1923]] it also set an international altitude record of 5,992 metres (19,660 feet) carrying a 500 kg (1,102 lb) load. It was later bought by Spanish government.

Many crews made long-distance flights in Br.19's. In February 1925 [[Edmond Thieffry|Thieffry]] flew from [[Brussels]] to [[Leopoldville]] in central Africa, a distance of 8,900 km (5,530 miles). Two Br.19 A2's were bought by the Japanese [[Asahi Shimbun]] newspaper and fitted with additional fuel tanks. They were flown by H. Abe and K. Kawachi on the [[Tokyo]]-[[Paris]]-[[London]] route in July 1925, covering 13,800 km (8,575 miles). Between 27 August and [[25 September]], [[1926]], the Polish crew of [[Boleslaw Orlinski]] flew the [[Warsaw]]-[[Tokyo]] route (10,300 km/6,400 miles) and back, in a modified Br.19 A2, despite the fact that one of its lower wings was broken on the way.  Between 1927 and 1930 Romanian, Yugoslavian and Polish Br.19's were often used in [[Little Entente]] air races.

Breguet 19 GR's and TR's set several world records, mostly of long-distance non-stop flights, starting with Arrachart and Lemaitre's 3,166 km (1,967 mile) flight from [[Paris]] to [[Dakhla, Western Sahara|Villa Cisneros]] in 24<U+00BD> hours on 2&ndash;3 February 1925. On 14-15 July 1926, Girier and Dordilly set a new record of 4,716 km (2,930 miles) between Paris and [[Omsk]], beaten on [[31 August]]-[[1 September]] by Challe and Weiser's 5,174 km (3,215 miles), and on [[28 October]] by [[Dieudonne Costes]] and Rignot's 5,450 km (3,386 miles). Between [[10 October]] [[1927]] and [[14 April]] [[1928]] Costes and Le Brix flew a Br.19 GR (named ''[[Charles Nungesser|Nungesser]]-Coli'') around the world, covering 57,000 km (35,418 miles) - though the journey between [[San Francisco]] and [[Tokyo]] was taken by ship. 

The Super Bidon was created especially for the purpose of a [[transatlantic flight]]. It was named "?" (''Point d'Interrogation'' - The Question Mark). Dieudonne Costes and [[Maurice Bellonte]] set a non-stop distance record of 7,905 km (4,911 miles) from Paris to [[Moullart]] on 27&ndash;29 September 1929 on this plane.  Then on 1&ndash;2 September 1930, they flew from Paris to [[New York City]], a distance of 6,200 km (3,852 miles) making the first non-stop east-west crossing by a fixed wing aircraft of the north Atlantic. The second Super Bidon, the Spanish ''Cuatro Vientos'', vanished over [[Mexico]] with M. Barberan and J. Collar Serra, after a transatlantic flight from  [[Seville]] to [[Cuba]] on 10&ndash;11 June 1933.
