'''East Technical High School''' or '''East Tech''' is a secondary school under the operation of the [[Cleveland Metropolitan School District]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. The school when it opened on [[October 5]], [[1908]] was the first public trade school in the city and reported to be only one of five in the entire [[United States]] at the time. East Tech's first principal was James F. Barker (1906-1911) from [[Muskegon, Michigan]].

The school was a sports powerhouse in the city, winning numerous titles in [[football]], [[basketball]] and [[track and field]]. Some notable alumni include [[Olympic Games]] athletic stars such as [[Jesse Owens]], [[Harrison Dillard]] and [[Dave Albritton]]. The original building stood for some 64 years until a new building was dedicated and moved into on [[October 11]], [[1972]].  The current structure now sits at the corner of E.55th and Scovill Ave on the east side of Cleveland. The original building has since been demolished.
