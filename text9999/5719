The '''''Minas Geraes'' class''',{{#tag:ref|Pronounced {{IPA-pt|<U+02C8>min<U+0250><U+0283> <U+0292>e<U+02C8><U+027E>aj<U+0283>|}} in Portuguese. [[Ship class]]es are named for the [[lead ship]], in this case {{Ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}}.|group=N}} spelled ''Minas Gerais'' in some sources,{{#tag:ref|"Geraes" was the spelling when the battleship was commissioned, but later changes to [[Portuguese orthography]] deprecated it in favor of "Gerais".|group=N}} consisted of two [[battleship]]s (Portuguese: ''encoura<U+00E7>ados'') built for the [[Brazilian Navy]] (''Marinha do Brasil'') by the British company [[Armstrong Whitworth]]. The ships were named [[Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes|''Minas Geraes'']], after [[Minas Gerais|the Brazilian state]], and [[Brazilian battleship S<U+00E3>o Paulo|''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'']], which dually honored [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|the state]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo|city]]. They were intended to be Brazil's first step towards becoming an international power.

In 1904, Brazil began a major naval building program that included three 11,800-long-ton (12,000&nbsp;tonne) small battleships. Designing and ordering the ships took two years, but these plans were scrapped after the revolutionary [[dreadnought]] concept rendered the Brazilian design totally obsolete. Two of these [[dreadnought]]s were ordered instead, making Brazil became the third country to have ships of this type under construction, before traditional powers like Germany, France or Russia. As such, the ships caused quite a stir among the major countries in the world, many of whom incorrectly speculated the ships were actually destined for a rival nation. 

Soon after their delivery in 1910, both ''Minas Geraes'' and ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' were embroiled in the [[Revolt of the Lash]] (''Revolta da Chibata''), in which the crews of four Brazilian ships demanded the abolition of [[corporal punishment]] in the navy. The ships surrendered four days after it began, when a bill was passed granting amnesty to all involved. In 1922, the two battleships put down [[18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt|a revolt]] at [[Fort Copacabana]]. Two years later, lieutenants on ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' mutinied but found little support from other military units, so they sailed to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and requested [[right of asylum|asylum]]. ''Minas Geraes'' was modernized in the 1930s, but both battleships were too old to actively participate in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and instead were employed as harbor defense ships in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]]. ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was sold in 1951 to a British [[ship breaking|shipbreaker]], but was lost in a storm north of the [[Azores]] while being towed to her final destination. ''Minas Geraes'' was sold to an Italian scrapper in 1953 and towed to [[Genoa]] the following year.

== Background ==
Argentina and Chile had been disputing the boundary of [[Patagonia]] and control of the [[Beagle Channel]] since the 1840s. The dispute nearly led to war in 1878 and kindled a naval arms race from 1887 to 1902 which was only settled via British mediation. As part of [[Treaty of Arbitration Between Chile and Argentina of 1902|the three pacts]] which ended the dispute, restrictions were placed on the navies of both countries, and major vessels under construction in both navies were sold.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45&ndash;52.</ref><ref>Garrett, "Beagle Channel Dispute," 86<U+2013>88.</ref> Meanwhile, beginning in the late 1880s, Brazil's navy fell into obsolescence after [[Politics of the Empire of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] was deposed in [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil#Fall|an 1889 revolution]] and a [[Revolta da Armada|civil war]] four years later.<ref name=Topliss240>Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240.</ref><ref name=Livermore32>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32.</ref><ref>Barman, ''Citizen Emperor'', 403.</ref><ref name=Filho75>Filho, "Colossos do mares," 75.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The civil war was begun by secessionists in the southern province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. In 1893, Rear Admiral [[Cust<U+00F3>dio Jos<U+00E9> de Mello]], the minister of the navy, revolted against President [[Floriano Peixoto]], bringing nearly all of the Brazilian warships currently in the country with him. Mello's forces took [[Florian<U+00F3>polis]] (then known as Desterro) when the governor surrendered, and began to coordinate with the secessionists, but loyal Brazilian forces overwhelmed them both. Most of the rebel naval forces were sailed to Argentina, where their crews surrendered; the flagship, [[Brazilian battleship Aquidab<U+00E3>|''Aquidab<U+00E3>'']], held out near Desterro until sunk by a torpedo boat.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 67&ndash;76, 352.</ref>|group=N}} By the turn of the 20th century it was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage,<ref name=Livermore32/><ref name=Filho75/>{{#tag:ref|Chile's naval tonnage was {{convert|36896|LT|t}}, Argentina's {{convert|34425|LT|t}}, and Brazil's {{convert|27661|LT|t}}.<ref name=Livermore32/> For an account of the Argentinian&ndash;Chilean naval arms races, see Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45&ndash;52.|group=N}} despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile.<ref name=Livermore32/><ref name=Conways403>Scheina, "Brazil," 403.</ref>

Soaring demand for [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)#Early 20th century|coffee]] and [[rubber boom|rubber]] brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s.<ref name=Conways403/> Simultaneously, there was a drive on the part of prominent Brazilians, most notably the [[Jos<U+00E9> Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco|Baron of Rio Branco]],{{#tag:ref|A professional diplomat and the son of the famed [[Jos<U+00E9> Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco|Viscount of Rio Braco]], "Pedro II's favorite politician", the Baron of Rio Branco was named as Brazil's [[Foreign Minister of Brazil|Foreign Minister]] in 1902, and served there until his death in 1912. In that time, he oversaw the signing of many treaties and mediated territorial disputes between Brazil and its neighbors, becoming a famous name in his own right.<ref>Barman, ''Citizen Emperor'', 403&ndash;404.</ref>|group=N}} to have the country recognized as an international power.<ref name=Scheina80>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80.</ref> A large naval acquisition program was drawn up and passed by the [[National Congress of Brazil]] in October 1904 in accordance with their belief that a powerful navy would be crucial to the achievement of this goal, but it was two years before any ships were ordered.<ref name=Topliss240/><ref name=Conways403/><ref name=Scheina80/>

Two factions argued over the types of ships to be ordered. One favored a navy centered around a small number of large warships, while the other preferred a larger navy of smaller warships.<ref name=Scheina80/> The latter originally prevailed with a bill authorizing the construction of three small battleships, three [[armored cruiser]]s, six [[destroyer]]s, twelve [[torpedo boat]]s, three [[submarine]]s, and two [[river monitor]]s.<ref name=Scheina80/><ref name=English108>English, ''Armed Forces'', 108.</ref> Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of Navy, Admiral [[J<U+00FA>lio C<U+00E9>sar de Noronha]], signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906.<ref>Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240&ndash;245.</ref> While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship [[HNoMS Norge|''Norge'']] and the British (originally Chilean) [[Swiftsure class battleship|''Swiftsure'' class]],{{#tag:ref|Incidentally, the ''Swiftsure'' class, named ''Constituci<U+00F3>n'' and ''Libertad'' before being bought by the British, were the two Chilean warships sold as part of the 1902 Argentinian&ndash;Chilean pacts that ended their naval arms race.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 52, 349.</ref>|group=N}} the contracted ships were to follow [[Armstrong Whitworth]]'s Design 439 (Design 188 in [[Vickers]]' files). They would displace 11,800&nbsp;long&nbsp;tons (12,000&nbsp;tonnes), have a speed of 19&nbsp;knots (22&nbsp;mph; 35&nbsp;km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9&nbsp;inches (23&nbsp;cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8&nbsp;cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25&nbsp;cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similarly to the later German [[Nassau class battleship|''Nassau''-class battleships]].<ref>Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 244&ndash;246.</ref>

[[File:Barao do rio branco 00.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jos<U+00E9> Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco]], [[circa|c.]] 1898]]
Alarmed, the American ambassador to Brazil sent a [[cablegram]] to his [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] in September 1906, warning them of the destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under [[Theodore Roosevelt]] tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with Baron de Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as [[suzerainty|suzerain]] Cuba. The [[President of Brazil]], [[Afonso Pena]], supported the naval acquisitions in an address to the National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 33.</ref>

== Bidding and construction ==
Design 439 was modified before these ships were [[keel laying|laid down]], increasing the displacement to {{convert|14334|LT|t|abbr=off}} and making them slightly longer and wider. Two of these ships were laid down by Armstrong in [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]] (''Minas Geraes'' and ''Rio de Janeiro''), while the other was [[subcontract]]ed out to Vickers in [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]] (''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''). However the new [[dreadnought]] concept, which premiered in December 1906 upon the completion of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|the namesake ship]] in December 1906, rendered the ships obsolete.<ref name=Topliss246>Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 246.</ref> In addition, many supporters of the small-ship plan were killed when the old [[Brazilian battleship Aquidab<U+00E3>|''Aquidab<U+00E3>'']] exploded in 1906. Believers in the other plan quickly seized the opportunity, and the transition to a few large warships was finalized with the selection of Rear Admiral [[Alexandrino Fario de Alencar]] for the powerful post of minister of the navy.<ref name=Scheina81>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81.</ref> The money authorized for naval expansion was redirected by de Alencar to building two dreadnoughts, with plans for a third dreadnought after the first was completed, two scout cruisers (which became the [[Bahia class cruiser|''Bahia'' class]]), ten destroyers (the [[Par<U+00E1> class destroyer (1908)|''Par<U+00E1>'' class]]), and three submarines.<ref name=Scheina81/><ref>''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'', "Brazil," 883.</ref> The three battleships on which construction had just begun were demolished beginning on 7 January 1907.<ref name=Topliss246/>

An entirely new design incorporating the latest dreadnought technology was drawn up by [[J.R.

[[Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes|''Minas Geraes'']], the [[lead ship]], was laid down by Armstrong on 17&nbsp;April 1907, while her [[sister ship]] [[Brazilian battleship S<U+00E3>o Paulo|''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'']] followed thirteen days later at Vickers.<ref name=Appendix7>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 321.</ref><ref name=Conways404>Scheina, "Brazil," 404.</ref><ref name=Topliss249>Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 249.</ref> Construction of the partial hull needed to [[ship naming and launching|launch]] ''Minas Geraes'' was delayed by a four-month [[strike action|strike]] to 10 September 1908,<ref name=Appendix7/><ref name=Conways404/><ref name=Topliss249/>''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' following on 19 April 1909.<ref name=Appendix7/><ref name=Conways404/><ref name=Topliss249/> Both were [[ship christening|christened]] in front of large crowds by the wife of [[Francisco R<U+00E9>gis de Oliveira]], the [[List of Ambassadors of Brazil to the United Kingdom|Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom]].<ref>"[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C17FA385A17738DDDA80994D1405B888CF1D3 Launch Greatest Warships]," ''The New York Times'', 11 September 1908, 5.</ref><ref>"[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A16FB3E5D12738DDDA90A94DC405B898CF1D3 Launch Brazil's Battleship]," ''The New York Times'', 20 April 1909, 5.</ref> After multiple [[Sea trial|trials]] of the speed, endurance, efficiency, and weaponry of the ship,<ref>''Journal of the United States Artillery'', "The Brazilian Battleship," 185&ndash;188.</ref> ''Minas Geraes'' was completed and handed over to Brazil on 6 January 1910; ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' followed in July.<ref name=Appendix7/><ref name=Conways404/>

== International reaction ==
The start of work on ''Minas Geraes'' meant that Brazil had become the third country<U+2014>behind the United Kingdom and the United States but ahead of major powers such as Germany, France, Russia and Japan<U+2014>to have a dreadnought under construction.<ref name=Conways403/><ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 13.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although Germany laid down their first dreadnought, {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, two months after ''Minas Geraes'', the German vessel was completed first.<ref name=Conways403/><ref>Campbell, "Germany," 145.</ref>|group=N}} At this time, the dreadnought design had not been fully validated, despite the success of the British namesake;<ref name=Scheina354>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 354.</ref> there were still concerns that the [[superfire|superfiring]] turret arrangement&mdash;which the original ''Dreadnought'' had not utilized&mdash;would cause the [[Blast injury|blast]] to hurt the crew in the lower turret.<ref>''Journal of the United States Artillery'', "The Brazilian Battleship," 187&ndash;188.</ref>

[[File:E Minas Geraes C.jpeg|right|thumb|''Minas Geraes'' conducting her gun trials, at that time the heaviest broadside ever fired off a ship]]
The keel laying and construction of the two dreadnoughts caused an immediate stir in the United States and Europe; in the words of the British ''[[Navy League Annual]]'', they "astonished the naval world".<ref>Quoted in Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81 from ''The Navy League Annual'', ''1910&ndash;1911'', 103.</ref> The British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debated purchasing the ships in March 1908 to bolster the Royal Navy while simultaneously ensuring they would not be sold to a foreign rival.<ref name=Topliss246/> The topic arose again in July and September, when [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Arthur Lee]] expressed his discomfort at the possible final dispositions of the Brazilian ships, as any sale had the potential to disrupt their "[[Two-Power Standard]]".<ref name=Topliss246/><ref>"[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19080912.2.100 British and Foreign News]," ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]]'', 12 September 1908, 13.</ref> ''[[International Marine Engineering]]'' analyzed the effect of a sale to Japan, stating that the total [[broadside]] weight of their [[line of battle]] would be increased by 31.6%, and the only ships that could match them in the near future would be the American [[Delaware-class battleship|''Delaware'']] and German [[Nassau-class battleship|''Nassau'']] classes.<ref>''International Marine Engineering'', "The Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 362&ndash;363.</ref>

Newspapers and journals around the world speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament.<ref>Filho, "Colossos do mares," 77.</ref> The evidence for a sale seemed strong, as Brazilian attempts to [[Float (money supply)|float]] a multi-million-dollar loan against the value of their coffee crop in 1908 were unsuccessful.<ref name=Topliss247>Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 247.</ref> With three dreadnoughts planned (including the upcoming [[HMS Agincourt (1914)|''Rio de Janeiro'']]), a Spanish naval journal stated "it was only natural that rumors [would begin] to circulate supporting the argument that Brazil acted as an intermediary for some great power which would acquire them before they terminate their construction."<ref>Quoted in Scheina, ''Naval History'', 354 from ''Revista General de Marina'' 64 (1908): 724.</ref> The British papers thought either the Germans, Japanese, or Americans were actually buying the ships, while many of mainland Europe's papers thought the British were going to take them over.<ref name=Conways404/> On the other side of the Atlantic, American papers opined that the ships would be sold to the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan.<ref name="Germany May Buy">"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany May Buy English Warships]," ''The New York Times'', 9 August 1908, C8.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' remarked:

<blockquote>The rumor is that the three warships ... ordered [in Britain] two years ago will be launched from English shores only to fly the German flag. It is asserted that these ships, which are named the Sao Paulo, the Minas Geras [''[[sic]]''] and the Rio de Janeiro, and all of which will be completed by next fall, will be conveyed to the German government on the payment of $30,000,000.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It may be recalled that when orders were placed for the ships [...], there was much speculation as to the destiny of the vessels, as no naval expert could understand how a second-rate power like Brazil needed such formidable engines of war which would represent absolutely the latest stages of naval construction and armament. Meanwhile, it had been reported that the ships were being built for the Japanese government, which had a secret understanding with Brazil. But this theory was soon discarded by the fact that relations between these two countries were not extremely cordial on account of the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese laborers.{{#tag:ref|For further information on Japanese immigration to Brazil, see [[Japanese Brazilian]].|group=N}} Then it was semi-officially stated that would never leave the ways except to fly the British flag, but the money for such a purpose could only be raised by a loan or the Admiralty getting the sum from the sinking fund. ("[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany May Buy English Warships]," ''The New York Times'', 9 August 1908, C8.)</blockquote>

Despite the speculation, the United States quickly began courting Brazil as an ally; caught up in the spirit, US naval journals began using terms like "Pan Americanism" and "Hemispheric Cooperation".<ref name=Conways404/>

In South America, the ships came as a rude shock and kindled a naval arms race among Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. The 1902 treaty between the latter two was canceled upon the Brazilian dreadnought order so both could be free to build their own dreadnoughts.<ref name=Livermore32/> Argentina in particular was alarmed at the possible power of the ships. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Manuel Augusto Montes de Orca]], remarked that either ''Minas Geraes'' or ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets.<ref name="Filho76"/> While this may have been hyperbole, either one was much more powerful than any single vessel in the Argentinian fleet.<ref>Scheina, "Argentina," 400.</ref> As such, the Argentines quickly responded to the dreadnoughts with an order to the United States for two of their own, the [[Rivadavia-class battleship|''Rivadavia'' class]], while Chile ordered two of the [[Almirante Latorre-class battleship|''Almirante Latorre'' class]] from the United Kingdom.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 82&ndash;85.</ref>

Soon after ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''{{'}}s arrival, a major rebellion known as the Revolt of the Lash, or ''Revolta da Chibata'', broke out on four of the newest ships in the Brazilian Navy. The initial spark was provided on 16 November 1910 when [[Afro-Brazilian]] sailor [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]] was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination.{{#tag:ref|The sailor's back was later described by [[Jos<U+00E9> Carlos de Carvalho]], a retired navy captain assigned to by the Brazilian government's representative to the mutineers, as "a mullet sliced open for salting."<ref>Quoted in Morgan, "The Revolt of the Lash," 41.</ref>|group=N}} Many  Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the ''[[Lei <U+00C1>urea]]'' (abolition) but forced to enter the navy.  They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of ''Minas Geraes'', ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', the twelve-year-old [[Brazilian battleship Deodoro|''Deodoro'']], and the new [[Brazilian cruiser Bahia|''Bahia'']] quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on ''Minas Geraes'' and one each on ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' and ''Bahia'' were killed.<ref>Morgan, "The Revolt of the Lash," 32&ndash;38, 50.</ref>

The ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers&mdash;led by [[Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto]]&mdash;was the abolition of "slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy".  They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including ''b<U+00F4>lo'' (being struck on the hand with a [[ferrule]]) and the use of whips or lashes (''chibata''), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general [[amnesty]] for the sailors. Senator [[Ruy Barbosa]], long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref>Morgan, "The Revolt of the Lash," 40&ndash;42.</ref>

Humiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser [[Brazilian cruiser Rio Grande do Sul|''Rio Grande do Sul'']], ''Bahia''{{'}}s sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns.  They planned to attack on the morning of the 25th, when the government expected the mutineers would return to [[Guanabara Bay]]. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125&ndash;23 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on the 26th.<ref>Morgan, "The Revolt of the Lash," 44&ndash;46.</ref>

During the revolt, the ships were noted by many observers to be well-handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary.  The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch were not, which led to a suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews show that ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} guns were fully operational, and while ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''{{'}}s could not be turned after salt water contaminated the [[hydraulic]] system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.<ref name=Scheina73/><ref>Morgan, "The Revolt of the Lash," 39&ndash;40, 48&ndash;49, 52.</ref>

=== Later career ===
Three years after the mutiny, ''Minas Geraes'' was used to transport Brazilian [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Lauro M<U+00FC>ller]] to the United States.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D02EEDE163DE633A25751C1A9619C946296D6CF Brazilian Envoy Host on Warship]," ''The New York Times'', 12 July 1913, 7.</ref><ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9406E4DF153FE633A2575BC1A9609C946296D6CF Tell Brazil's Envoy of Trade Problems]," ''The New York Times'', 18 June 1913, 14.</ref><ref name="Minas Poder">Poder Naval Online, "E Minas Geraes."</ref> She returned on 16 July and arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 16 August. In September both ''Minas Geraes'' and ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' participated in a major exercise with most of the Brazilian Navy. The need for a more modern fire control system was identified as early as late 1913, but no action was taken.<ref name="Minas Poder"/> When Brazil entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917, the ships were offered to the United Kingdom for service in the [[Grand Fleet]], but the British declined due to the condition of the ships. They had not been modernized since entering service, and maintenance had been neglected; for instance, when Brazil sent ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' to the United States for modernization in June 1918, fourteen of the eighteen [[boiler]]s that powered the ship failed. The ship only finished the voyage to New York with the assistance of the American battleship [[USS Nebraska (BB-14)|''Nebraska'']] and cruiser [[USS Raleigh (C-8)|''Raleigh'']].<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 26, 28.</ref> ''Minas Geraes'' followed after her sister's return, and the modernization was done between 1 September 1920 and 1 October 1921.<ref name="Minas Poder"/><ref name=Whitley26>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 26.</ref>

[[File:E Minas Geraes 1945.jpeg|thumb|left|''Minas Geraes'' anchored in Salvador, 1942]]
''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' made two trips to Europe in 1920: the first to convey King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]] and Queen [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876<U+2013>1965)|Elisabeth]] to Brazil and back, and the second to bring the body of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] to Brazil.<ref>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 28&ndash;29.</ref><ref name="Paulo Poder">Poder Naval Online, "E S<U+00E3>o Paulo."</ref> In July 1922, both battleships helped to quash the first of the [[Tenente revolts]] (''Revolu<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Tenentista''), in which the garrison of Rio de Janeiro's [[Fort Copacabana]] [[18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt|rebelled]] and began bombarding the city. ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; ''Minas Geraes'' did not fire her guns.<ref name=Poder/> In 1924, three lieutenants, including [[Hercolino Cascardo]], took over ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' with other crewmen. They were unsuccessful in swaying any other ships to their cause, except for an old torpedo boat, and soon sailed out of the harbor after firing a six-pounder gun at ''Minas Geraes''. Short of food and with [[Surface condenser|condensers]] in poor condition, the rebels sailed to [[Montevideo]], where they received asylum. ''Minas Geraes'' followed ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', arriving on 11 November and taking back possession of the ship.<ref>Scheina, ''Naval History'', 77&ndash;79.</ref>

''Minas Geraes'' was modernized at the [[Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard]] from June 1931 to April 1938, while ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' led a naval force that broke the naval [[blockade]] of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Santos]] during the [[Constitutionalist Revolution|Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932]].<ref name=Poder/> Though Brazil had also intended to modernize ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', her poor condition&mdash;she was only able to make {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}} instead of her designed speed of {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}&mdash;made such action uneconomical.<ref name=Whitley29>Whitley, ''Battleships'', 29.</ref> Soon after Brazil's entrance into the [[World War II|Second World War]] on 21 August 1942,<ref>Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 162&ndash;164.</ref> ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was moved to [[Recife]] on 23 August to defend that port as a harbor defense ship; ''Minas Geraes'' played a similar role at [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].<ref name="Minas Poder"/><ref name="Paulo Poder"/><ref name=Whitley29/> The ships were simply too old to actively participate in the war.<ref>Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars'', 164.</ref>

Both ships were [[ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] after the war, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' on 2 August 1947 and ''Minas Geraes'' on 31 December 1952. The former was sold to a British [[ship breaking|shipbreaker]] and was towed out of Rio de Janiero on 20 September 1951. About {{convert|150|nmi|mi km}} north of the [[Azores]] in a storm, the tow line snapped and the ship was lost. ''Minas Geraes'' was sold to an Italian company in 1953 and was towed to [[Genoa]] from 11 March 1954 to 22 April.<ref name="Minas Poder"/><ref name="Paulo Poder"/><ref name=Whitley29/>

The two ships of the  ''Minas Geraes'' class were {{convert|543|ft|m}} [[length overall|overall]], {{convert|530|ft|m}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]], and {{convert|500|ft|m}} [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|83|ft|m}}, a mean [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|25|ft|m}}, a maximum draft of {{convert|28|ft|m}}, a [[Displacement (ship)#Normal displacement|normal]] displacement of 18,976 [[long ton]]s (19,281 [[metric ton|t]]), and a displacement of 20,900 long tons (21,200 t) at [[Displacement (ship)#Full or deep load or loaded displacement|full load]]. At the beginning of their careers, the ships were crewed by about 900 men.<ref name=Conways404/>

''Minas Geraes'' and ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' were originally armed with twelve [[EOC 12 inch/45 naval gun|12-inch/45]] [[caliber#Caliber as unit of measurement|caliber]], twenty-two 4.7-inch/50 caliber, and eight [[Ordnance QF 3 pounder Vickers|3-pounder]] naval guns. The [[main battery]] was arranged with four [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets, two each fore and aft, and two placed ''[[en echelon]]''. The 4.7-inch secondary guns were placed in [[casemate]]s along the side of the ship.<ref name=Conways404/>

The propulsion of the two ships was provided by Vickers [[vertical triple expansion]] engines instead of the [[steam turbine]]s being used to power most contemporary dreadnoughts. Eighteen boilers provided power to the engines, which in turn rotated the two three-bladed [[propeller]]s with 23,500 [[shaft horsepower]]. Their designed top speed was {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}, though this was frequently unattainable in their later careers due to substandard maintenance and neglect. The ships could carry {{convert|2350|t|LT}} of coal and {{convert|400|t|LT}} of oil, and their original endurance was {{convert|10000|nmi|mi km}} when traveling at {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=Conways404/><ref name=Topliss250>Topliss, "The Brazilian Battleship," 250.</ref>

The main armor belt was nine&nbsp;inches (230&nbsp;mm) thick, but narrowed to six and three inches (150 and 76&nbsp;mm) closer to each end of the ships. The [[barbette]]s were protected by nine-inch armor, while the turret had a twelve-inch (300&nbsp;mm) front, eight-inch (200&nbsp;mm) sides, and a two- to three-inch (51&nbsp;to&nbsp;76&nbsp;mm) top, and the [[conning tower]] had twelve-inch armor. The deck armor had multiple decks of one-and-a-half to two&nbsp;inches (38&nbsp;to&nbsp;51&nbsp;mm), one&nbsp;inch (25&nbsp;mm), and one&nbsp;inch.<ref name=Topliss250/>
