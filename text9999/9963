The '''Eklutna Dam''', also referred to as the '''New Eklutna Dam''' or '''Upper Eklutna Dam''', is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Eklutna River]] about {{Convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Anchorage]] in [[Alaska]], [[United States]]. The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and it supports a 47 MW power plant. It was completed in 1929 but underwent several repairs over the years which concluded with a final raising in 1955. Ownership of the dam and power plant is shared by Anchorage Municipal Light & Power, Chugach Electric and Matanuska Electric.

==Background==
The original dam was constructed by the Anchorage Light and Power Company between 1927 and 1929 atop a natural [[landslide dam]] in the Eklutna Valley.<ref name=earthq>{{cite web|last1=Logan|first1=Malcolm H.|title=Effect of the Earthquake Of March 27, 1964, on The Eklutna Hydroelectric Project, Anchorage, Alaska|url=http://137.229.113.30/webpubs/usgs/p/text/p0545a.pdf|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=13 December 2014|date=1967}}</ref> It regulated the river to the Lower Eklutna Dam which diverted water into the [[Eklutna Power Plant|Old Eklutna Power Plant]]. The dam was rebuilt and improved in 1941 after the previous structure failed. During this same year, the population in Anchorage increased greatly with the onset of [[World War II]]. To cope with increasing power demand, the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] proposed the Eklutna Project. It included raising the dam and installing a new power plant opposite Goat Mountain to the north, along the [[Knik River]]. The [[United States Congress]] authorized the project on 31 July 1950. Construction began in 1951 and raising the dam commenced the following year. The first generator was commissioned on 8 January 1955, the second and last on 1 April 1955. On 1 July 1955 the entire project was complete.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Simonds|first1=Joe|title=The Eklutna Project|url=http://www.usbr.gov/history/eklutna.html|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation|accessdate=13 December 2014|date=1995}}</ref>

The dam is {{Convert|26|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{Convert|555|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. It is filled with {{Convert|5000|cuyd|m3|abbr=on}} sand, gravel and earth and its crest is {{Convert|875|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The reservoir created by the dam, Eklutna Lake, covers {{Convert|3247|acre|ha|abbr=on}} and is {{Convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} long. At an elevation of {{Convert|867.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the reservoir holds {{Convert|182000|acre.ft|m3|abbr=on}} of water. To connect the reservoir and power plant, there is a {{Convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} diameter, {{Convert|4.46|mi|km|abbr=on}} long [[penstock]] which starts at the intake, located on the northwest corner of the lake.<ref name=earthq/> From the intake, water rushes down the penstock where it reaches two 23.5 [[watt|MW]] [[Francis turbine]]-generators. Water used by the power plant is then discharged into the Knik River.<ref name=power/>
