	'''Donald Culross Peattie''' ([[June 21]], [[1898]] - [[November 16]], [[1964]]) was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[botanist]], [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[author]]. He was described by [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] as "perhaps the most widely read of all contemporary American nature writers" during his heyday. 

==Biography==
Peattie was born in [[Chicago]] to the journalist Robert Peattie and the novelist [[Elia Peattie]].  He studied French poetry for two years at the [[University of Chicago]] and then transferred to, and graduated (1922) from [[Harvard University]] where he studied with the noted botanist [[Merritt Lyndon Fernald]]. After field work in the Southern and Mid-West United States, he worked as a botanist for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (1922-1924). 

He was nature columnist for the ''[[Washington Star|The Washington Star]]'' from 1924 to 1935.

His [[nature writing]]s are distinguished by a poetic and philosophical cast of mind and are scientifically scrupulous. His best known works are the two books (out of a planned trilogy) on North American trees which he wrote in the late 1940s and early '50s. These were published as a single volume for the first time in April 2007 as ''A Natural History of North American Trees''. (Unfortunately, this hardbound volume reduces the two books' original 257 mini-essays to only 112 and includes only 135 of [[Paul Landacre]]'s original 365 woodcut illustrations.) 

Peattie also produced [[Children's literature|children's]] and [[travel books]], altogether totaling almost forty volumes.
