'''Michael Donald Kirby''' [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], (born 18 March 1939) is an Australian retired [[judge]], [[jurist]], and [[academic]] who is a former Justice of the [[High Court of Australia]], serving from 1996 to 2009.

==Biography==
Michael Kirby attended [[Fort Street High School]] in [[Sydney]]. He received his Bachelor of Arts (1959), Bachelor of Laws (1962), Bachelor of Economics (1965) and Master of Laws (First Class Honours) (1967) from the [[University of Sydney]]. At Sydney University, he was elected President of the [[University of Sydney Students' Representative Council|Students' Representative Council]] (1962<U+2013>1963) and President of the [[University of Sydney Union|Sydney University Union]] (1965).

Kirby was admitted to the [[New South Wales]] Bar in 1967. His first [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] appointment was to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, a tribunal which adjudicated labour disputes, upon which he served as a Deputy President from 1975 until 1983.

From 1983 to 1984, he was a judge in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] and the youngest man appointed to the federal judiciary, before an appointment as President of the [[New South Wales Court of Appeal]], a superior court in that state's legal system. During that period he was also the President of the Court of Appeal of Solomon Islands from 1995 to 1996. He was appointed to the [[High Court of Australia]] in February 1996. He has served on many other boards and committees, notably the Australian Law Reform Commission and the [[CSIRO]]. He is Patron of the Friends of Libraries Australia (FOLA) and many other bodies.

He was appointed a Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) on 31 December 1982, for his services to law.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1066397&search_type=quick&showInd=true Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George], CMG, 31 December 1982, itsanhonour.gov.au '''Citation:''' ''Services to the law''</ref> He received Australia's highest civil honour when he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (AC) in 1991<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=882348&search_type=quick&showInd=true Companion of the Order of Australia], CMG, 26 January 1991, itsanhonour.gov.au<br />'''Citation:''' ''For Service to the Law, Law Reform, to Learning and to the Community.''</ref> and in the same year was awarded the [[Human Rights Medal]].

==Jurisprudence==
In November 2003, at the [[University of Exeter]], Kirby delivered The Hamlyn Lectures<ref>{{cite speech

 | author = Michael Kirby

}}</ref> on the subject of [[judicial activism]]. Rejecting the doctrine of [[strict constructionism]], Kirby declared that:
:"Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have."

These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the [[United States]], as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of [[Natural law#In contemporary jurisprudence|natural law]] or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.

He had also addressed this topic in a 1997 speech to the Bar Association of India, in which he spoke approvingly of "a kind of "judicial activism" that is often in tune with the deeply felt emotions of ordinary citizens."<ref>{{cite speech

}}</ref> Nonetheless, Kirby is critical of the term "judicial activism" as applied to himself and other judges, and considers it hurtful. Kirby believes the term is "code language", applied chiefly by conservative commentators to views and to people with which they disagree.<ref>

He was often at odds with his colleagues in the [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson]] [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]. In 2004 he delivered a [[dissenting opinion]] on nearly 40% of the matters in which he participated, almost twice as many as any of his High Court colleagues; in constitutional cases, his rate of dissent was more than 50%. Legal researchers Andrew Lynch and George Williams observed that "even allowing for 2004 as a year in which Kirby J had a particularly high level of explicit disagreement with a majority of his colleagues, it is neither premature nor unfair to say that in the frequency of his dissent, his Honour has long since eclipsed any other Justice in the history of the Court... <nowiki>[Kirby]</nowiki> has broken away to claim a position of outsider on the Court which seems unlikely to pass with future years."<ref>http://www.gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/news/docs/HighCourtStatistics_2004.doc</ref> Kirby has responded, stating that "on their own, statistics tell little." To understand Kirby's rate of dissent, it is necessary to examine what his disagreements have been ''about'' and consider who he has dissented ''from''. Kirby explains "there have always been divisions, reflecting the different philosophies and perspectives of the office-holders", and that throughout the High Court's history, many dissenting opinions have ultimately been adopted as good law.<ref>{{cite speech

}}</ref> Further, Kirby argues that the rate of dissent, if seen within its context, is relatively small. Cases heard before the full bench of the High Court have proceeded through a series of lower courts and special leave hearings. They are thus likely to test the boundaries of the existing law, and raise opposing, though no less valid, views of the law.<ref>

In 2006, he attended the [[2006 World Outgames#International Conference on LGBT Human Rights|International Conference on LGBT Human Rights]] in [[Montreal]], presiding over the Asia-Pacific Plenary.

In November 2007, Kirby accused the Anglican and Catholic archbishops of Sydney, [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]] and [[George Pell]] respectively, of hindering the acceptance of gay people in Australian society, stating that homophobia was "reinforced even to this day by religious instruction, and it has to be said, religious instruction from the two archbishops of Sydney".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22819908-2,00.html }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Kirby also expressed disappointment in his "minority of one" status among his [[High Court of Australia]] colleagues, and indicated that "some of the justices perhaps have less liberal views than I have".<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In both 2009 and 2010, Kirby was selected by readers of samesame.com.au as one of the 25 most influential gay Australians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Samesame 25|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/25/2010/|publisher=samesame|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>

===Heffernan allegations===
{{See also|Bill Heffernan#2002|l1=Bill Heffernan}}
One of Kirby's most high-profile critics is [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Senator [[Bill Heffernan]]. In 2002, Heffernan used [[parliamentary privilege]] to accuse Kirby of misusing government resources to solicit under-age male prostitutes. However, the evidence Heffernan produced to support this claim was swiftly discovered to be a forgery, and Heffernan was censured by the Senate.<ref>{{cite news | author = Greg Jennett| title = Heffernan apologises to Kirby| url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s508589.htm| date = 19 March 2002| accessdate = 6 May 2009}}</ref> After Heffernan eventually apologised for making the allegations, Kirby promptly responded: "I accept Senator Heffernan's apology and reach out my hand in a spirit of reconciliation. I hope my ordeal will show the wrongs that hate of homosexuals can lead to."<ref>{{cite news| author = Fran Kelly| title = Justice Kirby accepts Heffernan's apology| url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s508367.htm | date = 19 March 2002| accessdate = 14 October 2006}}</ref>
