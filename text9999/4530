The '''123rd Boat Race''' took place on 19 March 1977.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Oxford won by seven lengths, their biggest margin of victory for more than 90 years.  It was the first time in the history of the event that one of the crews, Oxford, used a plastic boat as opposed to a wooden one.   It was also the first race to have an official sponsor in [[Ladbrokes]].

In the reserve race, Cambridge's [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] beat Oxford's Isis by seven lengths. Cambridge won the 32nd [[Women's Boat Race]].

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 8 April 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 3 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 24 July 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Ltd}}</ref>  The rivalry is a "hotly contested point of honour" between the two universities.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford&ndash;Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref>  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1976|1976 race]] by six-and-a-half lengths,<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/results| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 15 August 2014}}</ref> with Cambridge leading overall with 68 victories to Oxford's 53 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatrace.org/men/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 6 June 2014}}</ref>

The first [[Women's Boat Race]] took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history | title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 15 August 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.  It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.<ref name=results/>

Both crews rowed in [[monocoque]] boats for the first time in the history of the race;  Oxford used a Carbocraft shell (combining carbon fibre and plastic) for the first time, while Cambridge raced in a prototype developed by [[Imperial College London]].<ref name=prof/>  Journalist and author Christopher Dodd referred to the boats as "the most up-to-date boats that the rowing world has seen".<ref name=waltz>{{Cite news | first=Christopher | last = Dodd | work = [[The Guardian]] | title = Dark Blues half-minute waltz | date = 21 March 1977 | page=17}}</ref>  The race was sponsored for the first time, by British betting company [[Ladbrokes]],<ref name=prof>{{Cite web | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Professionalism arrives | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/report/professionalism-arrives | accessdate = 15 August 2014}}</ref> who would sponsor the event until the [[The Boat Race 1987|1987 race]] when they were replaced by [[Beefeater Gin]].<ref>{{Cite news | work = [[The Times]] | date = 28 March 1987 | page = 42 | issue = 62728 | title = Ill wind plagues Blues of 1987 | first = Jim | last = Railton}}</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 13&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 9.5&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (86.7&nbsp;kg), just over {{convert|6|lb|kg}} per rower more than their opponents.<ref name=krem/>  Returning Cambridge cox Joe Manser, at 9&nbsp;st 11&nbsp;lb, weighed {{convert|30|lb|kg}} more than his counterpart Colin Moynihan.<ref name=krem/>  Along with Manser, Cambridge saw the return of just one other former [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] in David Searle, while Oxford's crew included three Boat Race participants in Bob Mason, Crispin Money-Coutts and John Wiggins.<ref name=krem/>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is conducted]]
Oxford started the race as "one of the strongest favourites of all time",<ref name=krem/> with ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Christopher Dodd writing that "Oxford have some world-class pedigree".<ref>{{Cite news | title = A doddle for Oxford | first = Christopher | last= Dodd | date = 19 March 1977 | work = [[The Guardian]] | page = 16}}</ref>  They won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.<ref name=stormy>{{Cite news | title = No curtain calls for this stormy drama | first = Jim |last = Railton | date = 21 March 1977 | page = 9 | issue = 59957| work = [[The Times]]}}</ref> Within thirty seconds of the start, and in calm conditions, Oxford were a length ahead at [[Fulham F.C.]]<ref name=waltz/><ref name=task>{{Cite news | title = A light task for the Dark Blues | work = [[The Observer]] | first= Roger |last = Jennings | page =23 | date = 20 March 1977}}</ref> They moved further ahead to a two-length lead by the Mile Post, and a six-second advantage over the Light Blues.<ref name=stormy/>  Oxford extended their lead to three lengths and nine seconds by the time both crews shot [[Hammersmith Bridge]], where the crews were subjected to choppy water,<ref name=waltz/> but between there and Chiswick Steps, Oxford raced further ahead, gaining at least two further lengths on Cambridge.  Twenty seconds ahead at [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]], the Dark Blues continued to press home their advantage, and passed the finishing post in a time of 19 minutes 28 seconds, 22 seconds ahead of Cambridge.  It was Oxford's third victory in four years,<ref name="results"/> and the seven-length margin of victory was their greatest since their win in the [[The Boat Race 1898|1898 race]].<ref name=stormy/>

==Reaction==
Oxford stroke Andy Michelmore was surprised by the conditions: "we couldn't extend ourselves until the very end."<ref name=waltz/>  Of the rough water, Michelmore's cox, Moynihan, said "a sinking was possible. We shipped, I think, a couple of inches of water and I was more than apprehensive".<ref name=stormy/>
