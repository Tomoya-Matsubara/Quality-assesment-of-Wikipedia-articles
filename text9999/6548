'''Benromach''' is a [[Speyside Single Malts|Speyside]] distillery founded by Duncan McCallum and F.W. Brickman in 1898 and currently owned and run by Gordon and Macphail of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]]. It is situated near [[Forres]] in [[Morayshire]] and is fed with spring water from the Chapelton Springs in the Romach Hills beside [[Forres]]. 

==History==
Duncan MacCallum and F.W. Brickmann founded the Benromach Distillery Company in 1898. Duncan MacCallum had previously been working at the [[Glen Nevis Distillery]] in [[Campbeltown]] and FW Brickmann was a spirit broker in [[Leith]], [[Edinburgh]]. Construction work started at the site of Benromach Distillery in 1898 however due to the depression in the [[Scotch Whisky]] industry in 1898 the distillery did not start producing [[whisky]] until 1900 but closed the same year due to a lack of money.

In 1911 Benromach was acquired by the [[London]] based [[Harvey McNairn and Co|Harvey McNair & Co]] who continued distilling until the onset of the [[First World War]]. After the war Benromach was acquired by Benromach Distillery Ltd and was run by this new private company until 1925. In 1938 Benromach was acquired by [[Associated Scottish Distilleries Ltd]] which later became a part of [[Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd]]. Between 1966 and 1974 the distillery was modernised and continued to run until 1983 when the distillery was officially closed.

In 1993 [[Gordon and Macphail]] took over the site and in 1997 they started to restore the distillery to a working order. The design of the distillery was changed slightly to allow it to be operated by one man. Finally in 1998 the distillery was officially reopened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and bottling of the new malt started in 2004.
