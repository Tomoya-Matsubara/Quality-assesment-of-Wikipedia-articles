'''''Bambi, a Life in the Woods''''', originally published in Austria as '''''Bambi. Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde''''', is a 1923 [[Austrian_literature|Austrian novel]] written by [[Felix Salten]] and published by [[Paul Zsolnay Verlag]]. The novel traces the life of Bambi, a male [[roe deer]], from his birth through childhood, the loss of his mother, the finding of a mate, the lessons he learns from his father and experience about the dangers posed by human hunters in the forest. Considered to be one of the first environmental novels published, an English translation by [[Whittaker Chambers]] was published in North America by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1928. The novel has since been translated and published in over 20 languages around the world. Salten released a sequel, ''[[Bambis Kinder, eine Familie im Walde]]'' (''Bambi's Children''), in 1939.

The novel was well received by critics and is considered a classic. It was adapted into a theatrical animated film, ''[[Bambi]]'', by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]] in 1942, two Russian live-action adaptations in 1985 and 1986, and a musical in 1998. [[Janet Schulman]] released a children's picture book adaptation in 2000 that featured realistic oil-paintings and many of Salten's original words. A ballet adaptation was planned by Oregon Ballet Theatre for release in March 2000, but delayed after the company had issues with Disney over the licensing of the name ''Bambi''.

==Plot==
Bambi is a [[roe deer]] fawn born in a [[thicket]] to a young doe  in late spring one year. Over the course of the summer, his Mother teaches him about the various inhabitants of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the [[meadow]] which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.

As Bambi grows older, his mother begins to leave him alone. While searching for her one day, Bambi has his first encounter with "He"<U+2014>the animal's term for humans<U+2014>which terrifies him. The man raises a firearm  and aims at him; Bambi flees at top speed, joined by his mother. After he is scolded by a stag for crying for his mother, Bambi gets used to being alone at times. He later learns the stag is called the old Prince, the oldest and largest stag in the forest who is known for his cunning and aloof nature. During the winter, Bambi meets Marena, a young doe, Nettla, an old doe who no longer bears young, and two princes Ronno and Karus. Mid-winter, hunters enter the forest, killing many animals including Bambi's mother. Gobo also disappears and is presumed dead.

After this, the novel skips ahead a year, noting that Bambi was cared for by Nettla, and that when he got his first set of antlers he was abused and harassed by the other males. It is summer and Bambi is now sporting his second set of antlers. He is reunited with Faline. After he battles and defeats first Karus then Ronno, Bambi and Faline express their love for one another. They spend a great deal of time together. During this time, the old Prince saves Bambi's life when he nearly runs towards a hunter imitating a doe's call.  This teaches the young buck to be cautious about blindly rushing toward any deer's call. During the summer, Gobo returns to the forest having been raised by a man who found him collapsed in the snow during the hunt where Bambi's mother was killed. While his mother and Marena welcome him and celebrate him as a "friend" of man, the old Prince and Bambi pity him. Marena becomes his mate, but several weeks later Gobo is killed when he approaches a hunter in the meadow, falsely believing the halter he wore would keep him safe from all men.

As Bambi continues to age, he begins spending most of his time alone, including avoiding Faline though he still loves her in a [[melancholy]] way. Several times he meets with the old Prince who teaches him about [[snare]]s, shows him how to free another animal from one, and encourages him not to use trails to avoid the traps of men. When Bambi is later shot by a hunter, the Prince shows him how to walk in circles to confuse the man and his dogs until the bleeding stops, then takes him to a safe place to recover. They remain together until Bambi is strong enough to leave the safe haven again. When Bambi has grown gray and is "old", the old Prince shows him that man is not all powerful by showing him the dead body of a man who was shot and killed by another person. When Bambi confirms that he now understands that "He" is not all powerful, and that there is "Another" over all creatures, the stag tells him that he has always loved him and calls him "my son" before leaving to die. 

At the end of the novel, Bambi meets with twin fawns who are calling for their mother and he scolds them for not being able to stay alone. After leaving them, he thinks to himself that the girl fawn reminded him of Faline, and that the male was promising and that Bambi hoped to meet him again when he was grown.

A Life in the Woods''.<ref name="A New Look" /> Over 200 editions of the novel have been released, with almost 100 German and English editions alone, and numerous translations and reprintings in over 20 other languages. It has also been released in a variety of formats, including printed medium, [[audio book]], [[Braille]], and [[E-book]] formats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2866578/editions?editionsView=true&referer=di |title=Formats and Editions of Bambi, eine lebensgeschichte aus dem walde. |publisher=[[World Cat]] |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}</ref> Critics believe ''Bambi'' is one of the first [[Environmentalism|environmental]] novels to be released.<ref name="A New Look" /><ref name="Sound Recording" />

===Copyright dispute===
When Salten originally published ''Bambi'' in 1923, he did so under Germany's copyright laws, which required no statement that the novel was copyrighted. In the 1926 republication, he did include a United States copyright notice, so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1927. In 1936, Salten sold some rights to the novel to [[MGM]] producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney for the creation of a film adaptation. After Salten's death in 1945, his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel's copyrighted status in 1954. In 1958, she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel's rights. Upon her death in 1977, the rights passed to her husband, Veit Wyler, and her children, who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house [[Twin Books]]. Twin Books and Disney disagreed on the terms and validity of Disney's original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney's continued use of the Bambi name.<ref name="Twin Books v Disney" /> 

When the two companies were unable to reach a solution, Twin Books filed suit against Disney for copyright infringement. Disney argued that because Salten's original 1923 publication of the novel did not include a copyright notice, by American law it was immediately considered a [[public domain]] work. It also argued that as the novel was published in 1923, Anna Wyler's 1954 renewal occurred after the deadline and was invalid.<ref name="Twin Books v Disney" /><ref name="Schons" /> The case was reviewed by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], which ruled that the novel was copyrighted upon its publication in 1923, and not a public domain work then. However, in validating 1923 as the publication date, this confirmed Disney's claim that the copyright renewal was filed too late and the novel became a public domain work in 1951.<ref name="Twin Books v Disney" />

Twin Books appealed the decision, and in March 1996 the [[Ninth Circuit Court]] reversed the original decision, stating that as the novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was not in its home country's public domain when released, therefore the original publication date could not be used in arguing American copyright law. Instead, the 1926 publication date, the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States, is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America. As such, Anna Wyler's renewal was timely and valid, thereby upholding Twin Books ownership of the copyright.<ref name="Schons">{{Cite web |title=Bambi, the Austrian Deer |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/salten.html |last=Schons |first=Paul |publisher=[[Germanic-American Institute]] |month=September |year=2000 |accessdate=26 August 2008}}</ref>

===Sequel===
{{Main|Bambi's Children}}
While living in exile in in [[Switzerland]], after being forced to flee [[Nazi]] occupied [[Austria]], Salten wrote a sequel to ''Bambi'' that follows the birth and lives of Bambi's twin offspring, Geno and Gurri.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germanhollywood.com/salten.html |title=Felix Salten (Siegmund Salzmann, 1869<U+2013>1945) |first=Hyde |last=Flippo |authorlink=Hyde Flippo |work=The German-Hollywood Connection |publisher=The German Way and More |accessdate=20 July 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070806183453/http://www.germanhollywood.com/salten.html |archivedate=6 August 2007 }}</ref> The young fawns interact with various deer, and are educated and watched over by Bambi as they grow. They also learn more about the ways of man, including both hunters and the forest rangers seeking to protect the deer. Due to Salten's exiled status, the English translation of the novel was published in the United States in 1939 by [[Bobbs-Merrill]]. It would take another year before the sequel was published in Austria.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the Works of Arthur Schnitzler |first=Dagmar C.

==Reception==
''Bambi'' was "hugely popular" after its release, but was subsequently banned in [[Nazi Germany]] in 1936 as "political allegory on the treatment of Jews in Europe."<ref name="Eva Braun">{{cite book |title=The Lost Life of Eva Braun |first=Angela |last= Lambert |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |year=2008 |isbn=0312378653 | page=32 }}</ref> Many copies of the novel were burned, making original first editions rare and difficult to find.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilab.org/search.php?headerAlltext=Bambi+Eine+Lebensgeschichte+Aus+Dem+Walde&search=Search |title=Salten, Felix "Bambi ; Eine Lebensgeschichte Aus Dem Walde" |publisher=[[International League of Antiquarian Booksellers]] |accessdate=25 July 2009 }}</ref>

In his [[foreword]] of the novel, [[John Galsworthy]] called it a "delicious book" and a "little masterpiece" that shows a "delicacy of perception and essential truth". He notes that while reading the [[galley proof]] of the novel while crossing the [[English Channel]], he, his wife, and his nephew read each page in turn over the course of three hours in "silent absorption."<ref>{{cite book |title=Bambi | last=Salten |first=Felix |chapter=Foreword, dated 16 March 1928 |others=foreword by [[John Galsworthy]] |page=5 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |year=1988 |isbn=067166607X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RoLYY1nBPfAC&pg=PA5 }}</ref>  ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer John Chamberlain praised Salten's "tender, lucid style" that "takes you out of yourself."<ref name="New York Times Chamberlain">{{cite news |title=Poetry and Philosophy in A Tale of Forest Life |first=John R. |last=Chamberlain |date=8 July 1928 |page=53<U+2013>54 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 }}</ref> He felt that Salten captured the essence of each of the creatures as they talked, catching the "rhythm of the different beings who people his forest world" and showed particular "comprehension" in detailing the various stages of Bambi's life.<ref name="New York Times Chamberlain" /> He also considered the English translation "admirably" done.<ref name="New York Times Chamberlain" /> A reviewer for ''[[Catholic World]]'' praised the approach of the subject, noting that it was "marked by poetry and sympathy [with] charming reminders of German folklore and fairy tale".<ref name="Catholic World" /> However, they disliked the "transference of certain human ideals to the animal mind" and the vague references to religious [[allegory]].<ref name="Catholic World">{{cite journal |journal=Catholic World |author=MCM |volume=128 |issue=763<U+2013>768 |year=1928 |issn=0008-848X |title=New Books |pages=376<U+2013>377 }}</ref> The ''[[Boston Transcript]]'' called it a "sensitive allegory of life".<ref name="Book Review Digest">{{cite book |title=Book Review Digest, Volume 24 |publisher=[[H.W.

Vicky Smith of ''[[Horn Book Magazine]]'' felt the novel was gory compared to the later Disney adaptation and called it a "weeper". While criticizing it as one of the most notable anti-hunting novels available, she concedes the novel is not easily forgettable and praises the "linchpin scene" where Bambi's mother dies, stating "the understated conclusion of that scene, 'Bambi never saw his mother again,' masterfully evokes an uncomplicated emotional response".<ref name="horn book" /> She questions Galsworthy's recommendation of the novel to [[sportsmen]] in the foreword, wondering "how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten's unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated."<ref name="horn book">{{cite journal |title=A-Hunting We Won't Go |first=Vicky |last=Smith |journal=[[Horn Book Magazine]] |month=September<U+2013>October |year=2004 |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=521<U+2013>531 |issn=0018-5078 }}</ref> In comparing the novel to the Disney film, Steve Chapple of ''[[Sports Afield]]'' felt that Salten viewed Bambi's forest as a "pretty scary place" and the novel as a whole had a "lot of dark adult undertones."<ref name="Bambi Syndrome" /> Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten's own life, Chapple felt Salten "[came] across [as] a little morbid, a bleeding heart of a European intellectual."<ref name="Bambi Syndrome">{{cite journal |title=The Bambi syndrome |last=Chapple |first=Steve |journal=[[Sports Afield]] |volume=217 |issue=5 |page=128 |issn=0038-8149 }}</ref> The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''{{'}}s James P.

== Adaptations ==
===Walt Disney animated film===
{{main|Bambi}}
With [[World War II]] looming, Max Schuster aided the Jewish Salten's flight from [[Nazi Germany]] and helped introduce him, and ''Bambi'', to [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Studios]].<ref name="A New Look" /> Sidney Franklin, a producer and director at MGM films, purchased the film rights in 1933, initially desiring to make a live-action adaptation of the work.<ref name="Twin Books v Disney" /> Deciding such a film would be too difficult to make, he sold the rights to Walt Disney in April 1937 in hopes of it being adapted into an animated film instead. Disney began working on the film immediately, intending it to be the company's second feature length animated film and his first to be based on a specific, recent work.<ref name="Hollywood Cartoons">{{cite book |title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age |first=J. Michael |last=Barrier |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=0195167295 |chapter=Disney, 1938<U+2013>1941 |page=236, 244<U+2013>245 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zDJXnzMh7bkC }}</ref>

The original novel, written for an adult audience, was considered too "grim" and "somber" for the young audience Disney was targeting, and with the work required to adapt the novel, Disney put production on hold while it worked on several other works.<ref name="Hollywood Cartoons" /> In 1938, Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl Fallberg to develop the film's storyboards, but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name="Hollywood Cartoons" /> Finally, on 17 August 1939, production on ''Bambi'' began in earnest, although it progressed slowly due to changes in the studio personnel, location and the methodology of handling animation at the time. The writing was completed in July 1940, by which time the film's budget had swelled to $858,000.<ref name="Hollywood Cartoons2">{{cite book |title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age |first=J.

Heavily modified from the original novel, ''[[Bambi]]'' was released to theaters in the United States on 8 August 1942. Disney's version severely downplays the naturalistic and environmental elements found in the novel, giving it a lighter, friendlier feeling.<ref name="The Name is the Same" /><ref name="A New Look" /> Considered a classic, the film has been called "the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's animation studio" and was named as one of the Ten Top Ten<U+2014>the best ten films in ten "classic" American film genres<U+2014>by the [[American Film Institute]], listed as the third best film in the animation genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/animation.html |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |title=AFI's 10 Top 10 |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref>

===Russian live-action films===
In 1985, a Russian-language live-action adaptation, {{lang-ru|<U+0414><U+0435><U+0442><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+043E> <U+0411><U+0435><U+043C><U+0431><U+0438>}} (''Detstvo Bembi''), lit.

Natalya 's son [[Ivan Burlyayev]] and her husband [[Nikolay Burlyaev]] starred as the young and adolescent Bambi, respectively, while Faline (renamed Falina) was portrayed by Yekaterina Lychyova as a child and [[Galina Belyayeva]] as an adult. In this adaptation, the film starts using animals, changes to using human actors, then returns back to using animals for the ending.<ref name="UNC">{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/house/mrc/films/full.php?film_id=12579 |title=MRC FilmFinder<U+2014>Full Record: Detstvo Bembi |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] |accessdate=24 July 2009 }}</ref>

''Bambi's Youth'', followed in 1986 with Nikolay and Galina reprising their voice roles as Bambi and Falina. Featuring over 100 species of live animal and filmed in various locations in [[Crimea]], [[Mount Elbrus]], [[Latvia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], the film follows new lovers Bambi and Felina as they go on a journey in search of a live-giving flower.<ref name="Ruscico2">{{cite web |url=http://www.ruscico.com/dvd.php?lang=en&dvd=431 |title=Yunost Bembi |publisher=[[Ruscico]] |accessdate=24 July 2009 }}</ref> Both films were released to [[Region 2]] DVD with Russian and English subtitle options by the [[Russian Cinema Council]] in 2000. The first film's DVD also included a French audio soundtrack, while the second contained French subtitles instead.<ref name="Ruscico" /><ref name="Ruscico2" />

===Schulman adaptation===
In 1999, the novel was adapted into an illustrated hardback children's book by [[Janet Schulman]], with illustrations by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher and published by [[Simon & Schuster]] as part of its "Atheneum Books for Young Readers" imprint. In the adaptation, Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel. She notes that rather than rewrite the novel, she "replicated Salten's language almost completely. I reread the novel a number of times and then I went through and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written."<ref name="A New Look" /> Doing so retained much of the novel's original lyrical feel, though the book's brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the "majesty and mystery" found in the novel.<ref name="The Name is the Same" /> The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible, using painted images rather than sketches.<ref name="The Name is the Same" /><ref name="A New Look" /> In 2002, the Schulman adaptation was released in audio book format by [[Audio Bookshelf]], with Frank Dolan as the reader.<ref name="Sound Recording">{{cite journal |title=Felix Salten's Bambi (Sound Recording) |journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=11 March 2002 |volume=249 |issue=10 |page=24 }}</ref>

===Ballet===
The [[Oregon Ballet Theatre]] adapted ''Bambi'' into an evening-length [[ballet]] entitled ''Bambi: Lord of the Forest''.
