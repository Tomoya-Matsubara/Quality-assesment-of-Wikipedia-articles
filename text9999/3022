The '''Yugoslav torpedo boat ''T3''''' was a [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]], T-group sea-going [[torpedo boat]] built for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as '''''78 T''''' in 1914. She was armed with two [[<U+0160>koda Works|<U+0160>koda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} L/30 guns, four {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]], and could carry 10<U+2013>12 [[naval mine]]s. Crewed by 39 officers and enlisted men, she saw active service during [[World War I]], performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in 1918, she was allocated to the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], which subsequently became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed ''T3''.

During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by the Italians and after her main armament was modernised she served with the [[Regia Marina|Royal Italian Navy]] under her Yugoslav designation. Following the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulation]] in September 1943, she was captured by Germany, and after she was fitted with additional [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns she served with the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] as '''''TA48'''''. In German service her crew of 52 consisted entirely of [[Croats|Croatian]] officers and enlisted men. She was sunk by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft in February 1945 while in the port of [[Trieste]].

==Background==
In 1910, the [[Austria-Hungary]] Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a {{convert|275|LT|adj=on}} coastal [[torpedo boat]], specifying that it should be capable of sustaining {{convert|30|kn|km/h}} for 10 hours. This specification was based an expectation that the [[Strait of Otranto]], where the [[Adriatic Sea]] meets the [[Ionian Sea]], would be [[blockade]]d by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|kaiserliche und k<U+00F6>nigliche Kriegsmarine}}) base at [[Bay of Kotor|Cattaro]] to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. [[Steam turbine]] power was selected for propulsion, as [[Marine propulsion#Reciprocating diesel engines|diesels]] with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] boats. [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT) of [[Trieste]] was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The T-group designation signified the builder, STT.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

==Description and construction==
The [[250t-class torpedo boat|250t-class]], T-group boats had a [[waterline length]] of {{convert|58.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. While their designed displacement was {{convert|262|t|LT|lk=in|0}}, they displaced about {{convert|320|t|LT}} fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by a [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]] driving two propellers, using steam generated by two [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s, one of which burned [[fuel oil]] and the other coal. The turbine was rated at {{convert|5000|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}} with a maximum output of {{convert|6000|shp|lk=no|abbr=on}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. They carried {{convert|18|t|LT}} of coal and {{convert|24|t|LT}} of fuel oil,{{sfn|Jane's Information Group|1989|p=313}} which gave them a range of {{convert|980|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} The T-group had one [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] rather than the two funnels of the later groups of the class. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

The boats were originally to be armed with three [[<U+0160>koda Works|<U+0160>koda]] {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}}L/30{{refn|L/30 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/30 gun is 30 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibre]], meaning that the gun was 30 times as long as the diameter of its bore.|group = lower-alpha}} guns, and three {{convert|450|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed,{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} in order to standardise the armament with the following F-group. They could also carry 10<U+2013>12 [[naval mine]]s. ''78 T'' was the fifth of its class to be completed, and was laid down on 22 October 1913, launched on 4 March 1914, and completed on 23 August 1914. Eight T-group boats were completed between February and December 1914, designated ''74 T'' <U+2013> ''81 T''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}} In 1914, one {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]] was added.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}

==Career==

===World War I and interwar period===
The 250t-class, T-group were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with the boats. During [[World War I]], ''78 T'' was used for convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} She also conducted patrols and supported [[seaplane]] raids against the Italian Adriatic coast. Due to inadequate funding, ''78 T'' and the rest of the 250t-class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations.{{sfn|O'Hara|Worth|Dickson|2013|pp=26<U+2013>27}} In 1917, one of the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns on each boat was placed on an [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] mount.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

She survived the war intact,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} and under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] concluded in September 1919, she was allocated to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (KSCS, later Yugoslavia) in 1920, along with three other 250t class, T-group boats, ''76 T'', ''77 T'' and ''79 T'', which all served with the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] ({{Lang-sh-Latn|Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica}}, KJRM; <U+041A>pa<U+0459>e<U+0432>c<U+043A>a <U+0408><U+0443><U+0433><U+043E><U+0441><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> P<U+0430><U+0442><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430>). In KJRM service, ''78 T'' was renamed ''T3''.{{sfn|Greger|1976|p=58}}

===World War II===
In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered [[World War II]] when it was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis powers]]. At the time of the invasion, ''T3'' was assigned to the Southern Sector of the KJRM's Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with her [[sister ship]] [[Yugoslav torpedo boat T1|''T1'']] and a number of [[minesweeper]]s and other craft.{{sfn|Niehorster|2013}} ''T3'' was captured by the [[Royal Italian Navy]] ({{lang-it|Regia Marina}}) and was operated by them under her Yugoslav designation. She was fitted with two {{convert|76|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} L/30 anti-aircraft guns in place of her {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her.{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=304}}

When the Italians [[Armistice of Cassibile|capitulated]] in September 1943, the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kriegsmarine}}) seized ''T3'' in the port of [[Rijeka]] and renamed her ''TA48''. During her time in German service she was crewed exclusively by [[Croats|Croatian]] officers and sailors, and her complement was increased to 52.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}} The Germans fitted her with two single {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=107}} She was active in the northern Adriatic but saw little action.{{sfn|O'Hara|2013|p=181}} She was sunk in the port of [[Trieste]] by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft on 20 February 1945.{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}}{{refn|Sources conflict on who sank ''TA48''. Gardiner and Lenton state Allied aircraft,{{sfn|Gardiner|1985|p=339}}{{sfn|Lenton|1975|p=110}} Chesneau states British aircraft,{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=357}} and Wilmott states US aircraft.{{sfn|Willmott|2010|p=209}}|group = lower-alpha}}
