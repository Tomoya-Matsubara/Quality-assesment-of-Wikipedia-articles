[[Admiral of the Blue]] '''Sir Henry Digby''' [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] (20 January 1770&nbsp;<U+2013> 19 August 1842) was a senior British naval officer, who served in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. Born into a long established naval family, his uncle was the famous Admiral [[Robert Digby]], Henry went to sea at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] aged fourteen.

As a Lieutenant aboard [[HMS Pallas (1793)|HMS ''Pallas'']], he received a commendation for rescuing the crew of a [[HMS Boyne (1790)|burning ship]]. Promoted to Commander in August 1795 and Captain in December 1796, Digby established a reputation as an aggressive prize taker, capturing 57 ships in less than twenty months. His richest capture came in October 1799 when he assisted in the taking of the treasure ship, the Santa ''Brigida''. He commanded [[HMS Africa (1781)|HMS ''Africa'']] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], manoeuvering her into the French and Spanish fleet against orders, having been instructed by [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] to avoid battle, fearing Digby's small [[ship of the line]] would be overwhelmed.

In 1806 Digby married Lady Jane Elizabeth Coke, daughter of [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester]] with whom he had three children. They moved to the estate in [[Dorset]] inherited from his uncle where the prize money amassed by Digby paid for a comfortable life. He continued to serve in the navy, was appointed [[Commander in Chief]], [[Sheerness]] and attained the rank of [[Admiral]] in 1841. 

==Early life==
The nephew of [[Robert Digby (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Digby]], Henry was born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] on the 20 January 1770.<ref name=BB261>Broadly & Bartelot (1906) p.261</ref> His father, the Hon. Rev. William Digby, was the younger brother of the sixth [[Baron Digby]] and later became Dean of [[Durham]] and Chaplain Ordinary to [[King George III]].<ref name=HC51/> Henry was one of ten children and the oldest of four boys; two of whom, Charles George (1780) and Joseph (1786), also served in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Broadly & Bartelot (1906) pp.260-261</ref> The younger, Joseph, later becoming a Vice-Admiral. <ref name=BB261>Broadly & Bartelot (1906) p.261</ref> On the 2nd April 1783, Henry was entered onto the muster roll of HMS ''Jason'' then [[HMS Vestal (1779)|HMS ''Vestal'']] from the 1st May till the 6th March 1784 as a captain's servant. After a six week break, on the 16th April he was entered into the books of [[HMS Royal Charlotte|HMS ''Royal Charlotte'']] until the end of the year when he finally went to sea aboard the 50-gun [[HMS Europa (1783)|HMS ''Europa'']] and sailed for the [[West Indies]].<ref name=BB261/>

==Naval career==
Digby was to spend the next two and half years aboard the ''Europa''. He was almost immediately promoted from Captain's servant to [[Able seaman (rank)|Able Seaman]] and shortly after, to [[Midshipman]].<ref name=BB261/> On the 4th July 1787, after a brief return to England, he was appointed, first to the [[HMS Janus (1778)|''Janus'']] and then the [[HMS Salisbury (1769)|''Salisbury'']] on the [[North America and West Indies Station|North American station]].<ref name=BB261/> Digby's father died in November 1788 and he returned home but by December he was aboard the sloop [[HMS Racehorse (1781)|''Racehorse'']] trying to stop the smuggling trade in the [[North Sea]]. He returned to England once more on the 22nd September 1789 and did not go to sea again until the following August during which time he passed his lieutenant's exam.<ref name=BB262>Broadley and Bartelot (1906) p.262</ref> After a short probationary period aboard [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], he was confirmed as Fourth Lieutenant of the [[HMS Lion (1777)|''Lion'']] in October 1790. <ref name=BB262/><ref name=HC51>Heathcote (2005) p.51</ref> Returning from the West Indies in September 1791, Digby spent a year and eight months in England dealing with family affairs, following the death of his mother.<ref name=BB262/>

On the 5th May 1793, Digby was appointed First Lieutenant of [[HMS Eurydice (1781)|HMS ''Eurydice'']] serving in the [[Channel Squadron]], and from there to the [[HMS Proserpine (1777)|''Proserpine'']] on the 16th February 1794.<ref name=BB262/> Appointed Second Lieutenant to the 5th rate [[HMS Pallas (1793)|HMS ''Pallas'']] on the 25th March, he received a commendation for saving hundreds of lives when, on the 1st May 1795, the [[first-rate]] [[HMS Boyne|HMS ''Boyne'']] caught fire and exploded in [[Spithead]].<ref name=HC51/> Digby took a small boat close into the blazing ship to rescue men struggling in the water despite the risk of instant annihilation should the ammunition store catch alight, as happened later that day.<ref name=HC51/> Shortly after, on the 20th May 1795, Digby joined [[HMS Dictator (1783)|HMS ''Dictator'']] as First Lieutenant and stayed with her until he was promoted in August that year.<ref name=BB263/>

===First commands===
In August 1795, Digby was promoted to commander of the 16 gun fireship, ''[[HMS Incendiary]]'', operating in [[Quiberon Bay]] and the [[English Channel|Channel]].<ref name=HC51/> On the 16 December 1796 he made [[Post Captain]] and was appointed to the 6th rate, 28 gun, ''[[HMS Aurora (1777)|Aurora]]'', escorting convoys in the waters around Portugal and Spain and damaging the enemy's commercial interests wherever possible.<ref name=HC51/><ref name=BB263>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.263</ref> In these first two commands, Digby took 57 enemy vessels before transferring to [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|HMS ''Leviathan'']] under Commodore [[Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet|John Duckworth]] and was present at the capture of [[Minorca]] in November 1798.<ref name=HC52>Heathcote (2005) p.52</ref> In 1799 he was given a lucrative independent cruise in the frigate [[HMS Alcmene (1794)|HMS ''Alcmene'']]. Patrolling the waters in and around Portugal and the Azores, Digby captured dozens of small merchant ships and a 28 gun French privateer, ''Courageux''.<ref name=HC52/>

Digby's habit of using his own funds to pay prize money to his crew straight away, rather than have to wait for a judgement from an Admiralty court; coupled with his aggressive, near record breaking prize taking; made him extremely popular with seamen and officers alike and he was never short of volunteers to sail with him.<ref>Heathcote (2005) pp.51-52</ref><ref name=BB263/> One particular capture, that of the [[Spanish ship Santa Brigida|''Santa Brigida'']], contained such wealth that even an Ordinary Seaman received <U+00A3>182.<ref name=HC52/>

===Capture of the Santa Brigida===
Digby claimed that a dream caused him to change course and as a result, at dawn on the 16 October 1799, the ''Alcmene'' encountered two British frigates.<ref name=HC52/> [[HMS Naiad (1797)|HMS ''Naiad'']] and [[HMS Ethalion (1797)|HMS ''Ethalion'']] were chasing two 34 gun Spanish frigates, [[Spanish ship Santa Brigida|''Santa Brigida'']] and ''Thetis''. Digby's ship joined the pursuit and soon after a fourth frigate arrived. At 7.00am the two Spaniards parted company so Naiad followed one frigate, together with {{HMS|Alcmene|1794|2}} and the newly arrived {{HMS|Triton|1796|2}}, while ''Ethalion'', set after the other frigate. By 11.30am, ''Ethalion'' had caught up with her quarry and after a short engagement the Spanish vessel [[Striking the colours|struck her colours]]. ''Ethalion'' had no casualties though the Spaniard had one man killed and nine wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1093|endpage=1094|issue=15197|date=22 October 1799}}</ref> ''Triton'', the fastest of the three British frigates, led the chase of the second frigate. The next morning ''Triton'' struck some rocks off [[Muros, A Coru<U+00F1>a|Muros]] as she tried to prevent her quarry from reaching port. ''Triton'' got off the rocks and resumed the chase despite taking on water. She and ''Alcmene'' then exchanged fire with the Spanish frigate, which surrendered before ''Naiad'' could catch up.<ref name=HC52/><ref name=J2.358>James (1837) Vol.II p.358</ref>

The ''Santa Brigida'''s cargo included 1,400,000 [[Spanish Dollar|Pieces of Eight]] and Digby's share of the prize fund came to <U+00A3>40,731, not including the ship itself which wasn't purchased.<ref name=HC52/><ref name=J2.358/> This was more than twice the total prize money Digby had thus far accrued in his career (around <U+00A3>20,000).<ref name=HC52/>

===Peace===
Digby returned to England in early 1801 and spent 10 weeks without a ship. In May he took command of [[HMS Resistance (1801)|HMS ''Resistance'']], on the North American station, in which he captured the French privateer ''Elizabeth'', the last capture before the [[Peace of Amiens]]. <ref name=BB267>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.267</ref> Digby spent the next three years on half pay before being given HMS ''Africa'' in July 1805. An old, small battleship, ''Africa'' possessed just 64 guns and was considered by many as much too small to serve in the line of battle in a major fleet engagement. Ordered to join [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson's]] fleet off Cadiz, Digby arrived just days before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on the 21st October.<ref name=BB267>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.267</ref>

===Trafalgar===
[[File:Trafalgar 1200hr.svg|thumb|''Africa'', off station, complies with Nelson's order to rejoin the fleet by setting a course parallel to the enemy van.]]
The ''Africa'' was also a poor sailor, and on the morning of the battle, as a result of bad weather and a missed signal during the night, Digby found his ship far off station to the north and was thus very isolated.<ref name=HC53/> Nelson saw the predicament and sent a signal instructing Digby to "Make all sail", intending him to pull back from the enemy rather than risk being overwhelmed as there were ten enemy ships between ''Africa'' and the British fleet, all larger than ''Africa'' in size.<ref name=HC53>Heathcote (2005) p.53</ref>

Digby indignantly received the order and then deliberately misinterpreted it as an instruction to close with the British fleet to the south, and so weaved between the advancing enemy, engaging each in turn with both broadsides before reaching the melee surrounding the enormous Spanish flagship, the 130 gun [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de la Sant<U+00ED>sima Trinidad (1769)|''Santissima Trinidad'']]. <ref name=HC53/> Believing that she had surrendered, Digby dispatched his first lieutenant, John Smith, on board to take the surrender. Smith and his party actually reached the Spanish quarterdeck unmolested before realising that the ship was still fighting. Fortunately in that chivalrous age the Spanish admiral allowed Smith's party to return to their boat unharmed.<ref name=HC53/>  Sailing south from the battle, ''Africa'' encountered the [[French ship Intr<U+00E9>pide|''Intr<U+00E9>pide'']] and fought her continuously for 40 minutes until [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] arrived and the French ship surrendered as she was outnumbered.<ref name=HC53/>  In this fight ''Africa'' was very badly damaged and lost 62 men killed or wounded, including most of her officers.

The damage suffered by the ''Africa'' was highlighted in March 2006 when the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' examined a book that was extensively damaged by a [[Round shot|cannonball]].  Digby's inscription inside read ''... this book was shivered in this manner by a whole shot, knocking to pieces the bookcase ... off Cape Trafalgar on 21st October 1805 ... on board the 'Africa' (64 guns).'' signed Henry Digby.

Some 10 years after the battle, Digby received some criticisms for his actions. On hearing a rumour that Nelson had disapproved of Digby's behaviour at Trafalgar, [[Thomas Masterman Hardy|Hardy]] wrote: ".....I beg to assure you that Lord Nelson expressed great satisfaction at the gallant manner in which you passed the enemy's line; and I assure you he appeared most fully satisfied with the conduct of the Africa. I shall be most happy personally to contradict the report, if you will inform me of the Captain's name who conveyed it to you".<ref>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) pp.270-271</ref>

==Later life==
On the 17th April 1806, he married Lady Jane Elizabeth Coke, a renowned beauty, and daughter of [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester]].<ref name=BB271/> They had three children, the eldest son, [[Edward Digby, 9th Baron Digby|Edward St Vincent]], born 1806, became the 9th Baron Digby in 1856. Their daughter, born in 1807, was the scandalous adventuress, [[Jane Digby]].

For his role at Trafalgar, Digby received a further <U+00A3>973 prize money and a proportion of a government grant amounting <U+00A3>2389 7s 6d, which together with the money accumulated from earlier successes paid for a large manor and a very comfortable life.<ref name=BB271>Broadley & Bartelot (1906) p.271</ref> In 1815 his uncle, Admiral Robert Digby, died leaving Henry the estate in [[Minterne Magna]] to which he retired with his family. Digby did not leave the [[Royal Navy]] however, and continued to serve for many years, advancing by seniority through the ranks; making Rear Admiral{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} in 1819 and Vice Admiral in 1830.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}He received the [[Order of the Bath]] in 1815 and served as [[High Sheriff of Dorset]] in 1835.
{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} Digby was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore]] in 1840.<ref>[http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowCommanders.php William Loney RN]</ref><ref>Heathcote (2005) p.54</ref>  
He died in 1842 and was buried in the local churchyard with many of his family, where his tombstone can still be seen. At the time of his death he was a full Admiral of the Blue {{Ref_label|D|d|none}} and had become a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]]{{Ref_label|E|e|none}}

Henry's great great granddaughter was the 20th century socialite and diplomat [[Pamela Harriman]] who grew up on the family estate in [[Dorset]].
