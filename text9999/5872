'''White-tailed spiders''' are medium-sized [[spider]]s native to southern and eastern [[Australia]], and so named because of the whitish tips at the end of their [[abdomen]]s. Common species are ''Lampona cylindrata'' and ''Lampona murina''. Both these species have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to [[New Zealand]].<ref name="Slaughter">{{cite journal |author=Slaughter RJ, Beasley DM, Lambie BS, Schep LJ |title=New Zealand's venomous creatures |journal=N.

White-tailed spiders are vagrant hunters who seek out prey rather than spinning a web to capture it. Their preferred prey is other spiders and they are equipped with venom for hunting.

They are known to bite humans and effects may include local [[pain]], a red mark, local swelling and itchiness; rarely [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[malaise]] or [[headache]] may occur. [[Ulcer (dermatology)|Ulcers]] and [[necrosis]] have been attributed to the bites, but a scientific study by Isbister and Gray (2003) showed these were probably caused by something else, as the study of 130 white-tailed spider bites found no necrotic ulcers or confirmed infections.<ref name="Isbister"/>

==Taxonomy==

[[Ludwig Carl Christian Koch]] described ''Lampona cylindrata'' in 1866 and ''Lampona murina'' in 1873. The genus name comes from the Latin ''lampo'' which means shine. The species name ''cylindrata'' refers to the cylindric body shape, while ''murinus'' means "mouse-gray" in Latin.<ref name="AusGov">{{cite web | last = Gray | first =Mike | title =''Lampona cylindrata'' (Family Lamponidae) White-tailed Spider| publisher = Australian Government: The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts  | date =   | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/species-bank/sbank-treatment.pl?id=69194| accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref><ref name="AM"/>

==Description==

[[File:Whitetailbig.jpg|thumb|left|Adult white-tailed spider showing body pattern details]]

The two common species of white-tailed spiders are ''Lampona cylindrata'' and ''Lampona murina''. They are similar in appearance; ''L. cylindrata'' is slightly larger with females being up to 18&nbsp;mm long while males are up to 12&nbsp;mm in body length.<ref name="Platnick">{{cite journal |author=Platnick NI |title=A relimitation and revision of the Australasian ground spider family Lamponidae (Araneae: Gnaphosoidea) |journal=Bull Am Mus Nat Hist |volume=245 |issue= |pages=1<U+2013>328 |year=2000 |pmid= |doi=10.1206/0003-0090(2000)245<0001:ARAROT>2.0.CO;2}}</ref><ref name="AM"/> The legs span approximately 28&nbsp;mm in diameter.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title =Spiders in New Zealand| publisher = New Zealand National Poison Centre | year = 2008 | url = http://poisons.co.nz/fact.php?f=10&c=20| accessdate = 2008-02-10}}</ref> The two species are not easily distinguished from one another without microscopic examination. They are slender spiders having dark reddish to grey, cigar-shaped body and dark orange-brown banded legs. The grey abdomen has two pairs of faint white spots and a distinct white spot at the tip just above the spinnerets.<ref name="AM">{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title =White-tailed spiders | publisher = Australian Museum | year = 2003 | url = http://www.amonline.net.au/factsheets/white_tailed_spider.htm| accessdate = 2008-02-10}}</ref><ref name="tepapa">{{cite web | last= | first= | title=White-tailed spiders (''Lampona cylindrata'' and ''Lampona murina'')| publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | date= | url= http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/ResearchAtTePapa/Enquiries/SpidersWeb/What/Pages/White-tailed.aspx

The similarities have led people to think there is only one species of white-tailed spider. It is possible that not all white-tailed species have been identified. The descriptor, ''white tail'', is applied to a variety of species of spiders for which a distal white mark on their abdomen is a distinctive feature; other markings disappear with moultings but the white tail remains to adulthood.

''L. cylindrata'' lay pinkish eggs which are enclosed in a flattened silk capsule and are guarded by the female until they hatch.<ref>{{cite web | last= | first= | title=White tailed spider: ''Lampona cylindrata'' | url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/spiders/detail.aspx?pid=20&pic=0 | date= | work= | publisher=Museum Victoria | accessdate=2009-04-03 }}</ref>

==Distribution==
Both species are native to Australia. ''Lampona cylindrata'' is present across south-east Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia while ''Lampona murina'' is found in eastern Australia from north-east Queensland to Victoria.<ref name="AM"/> The spiders have been introduced in New Zealand with ''Lampona murina'' residing in the North Island for over a hundred years while ''Lampona cylindrata'' has become widespread throughout the South Island since 1980.<ref name="tepapa"/>

==Habitat and behaviour==
They live in gardens and inside houses, beneath bark and rocks, in leaf litter and are often found in the folds of clothes, towels and shoes.<ref name="Slaughter"/> They do not build webs. According to the [[Queensland Museum|Qld Museum]] they cannot climb glass.<ref name="QLD_Muesum">{{cite web | last= | first= | title=White-tailed spiders(''Lampona cylindrata'' and ''Lampona murina'')| publisher = Queensland Museum | date= | url= http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Animals+of+Queensland/Spiders/Modern+Spiders+Infraorder+Araneomorphae/White-tailed+spiders
 | accessdate = 2012-11-14}}</ref> Most active at night, they hunt for other spiders. Their favoured prey is the [[black house spider]].<ref name="Forster">{{cite book | last = Forster | first = Ray | coauthors = Forster, Lyn | authorlink =  | title = Spiders of New Zealand and Their Worldwide Kin | publisher = University Of Otago Press | location = Dunedin | year = 1999 | pages = 111<U+2013>2 | doi =  | isbn = 1-877133-79-5}}</ref>

==Bites to humans==
White-tailed spiders wander about human dwellings and may be encountered unexpectedly, unlike the [[black house spider]] and the [[redback spider|redback]] which are more often seen in a web. They may be responsible for a disproportionately high number of spider bites compared with other Australian spiders, because of their wandering habits. Of the 130 cases studied by Isbister and Gray, more than 60% of the victims had been bitten by spiders that had got into clothing, towels or beds.

The bite of white-tailed spiders has been wrongly implicated in cases of [[necrosis#Arachnogenic_necrosis|arachnogenic necrosis]].  The misassociation stems from a paper presented at the [[International Society on Toxinology]] World Congress held in Brisbane in 1982.  Both white-tailed and the [[wolf spider]] were considered as candidates for ''possibly'' causing ''suspected'' spider bite [[necrosis]], though it later turned out that the [[recluse spider]] was the culprit in the reported cases from [[Brazil]].

Following this initial report, numerous other cases implicated white-tailed spiders in causing necrotic ulcers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gray M |title=A significant illness that was produced by the white-tailed spider, Lampona cylindrata |journal=[[Med J Aust]] |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=114<U+2013>6 |year=1989 |month=July |pmid=2739605 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=St George I, Forster L |title=Skin necrosis after white-tailed spider bite? |journal=[[N Z Med J]] |volume=104 |issue=912 |pages=207<U+2013>8 |year=1991 |month=May |pmid=2052219 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Skinner MW, Butler CS |title=Necrotising arachnidism treated with hyperbaric oxygen |journal=Med J Aust |volume=162 |issue=7 |pages=372<U+2013>3 |year=1995 |month=April |pmid=7715520 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chan SW |title=Recurrent necrotising arachnidism |journal=Med J Aust |volume=169 |issue=11<U+2013>12 |pages=642<U+2013>3 |year=1998 |pmid=9887918 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/xmas98/chan/chan.html}}</ref> All of these cases lacked a positively identified spider<U+2014>or even a spider bite in some cases. Additionally there had not been a case of arachnogenic necrosis reported in the two hundred years of European [[colonisation]] before these cases. Clinical toxicologist Geoffrey Isbister studied 130 cases of [[arachnologist]]-identified white-tailed spider bites, and found no necrosis or confirmed infections, concluding that such outcomes are very unlikely for a white-tailed spider bite. The major effects from a bite were local [[pain]], a red mark, local swelling and itchiness; rarely systemic effects of [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[malaise]] or [[headache]] occurred.<ref name="Isbister">{{cite journal |author=Isbister GK, Gray MR |title=White-tail spider bite: a prospective study of 130 definite bites by ''Lampona'' species |journal=Med.
