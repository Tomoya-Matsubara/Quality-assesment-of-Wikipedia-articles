The '''Amruteshvara temple''' ({{lang-kn|<U+0C85><U+0CAE><U+0CC3><U+0CA4><U+0CC7><U+0CB6><U+0CCD><U+0CB5><U+0CB0> <U+0CA6><U+0CC7><U+0CB5><U+0CB8><U+0CCD><U+0CA5><U+0CBE><U+0CA8>}}) is located in the town of Amruthapura, 67&nbsp;km north of [[Chikmagalur]] town in the [[Chikkamagaluru district]] of the [[Karnataka|Karnataka state]], [[India]]. Located 110&nbsp;km from [[Hassan, India|Hassan]] and 35&nbsp;km from [[Shimoga]] on NH&nbsp;206, Amruthapura is known for the splendid Amruteshvara temple (also often spelt ''Amruthesvara'' or ''Amrtesvara''). The temple was built in 1196 C.E. by Amrutheshwara ''Dandanayaka'' (''lit'', "commander") under [[Hoysala]] King [[Veera Ballala II]]. It is located in an idyllic spot, in the close vicinity of the [[Bhadra River]] reservoir. The rise of the Hoysala power in the 11th-12th centuries created many important towns and cities (''nagara'') along the [[malnad]] (hill) regions of present day Karnataka where they built many ornate temples.

==Amrutesvara temple==

The temple is a fine example of 12th century [[Hoysala architecture]] with a wide open ''mantapa'' (hall).<ref name="hall">Foekema (1996), p37</ref> Surrounded by [[Arecaceae|Palm]] and [[Coconut]] farms, the temple still has a well preserved original outer wall with interesting, equally spaced circular carvings. The temple has one ''[[Vimana (shrine)|vimana]]'' (shrine and tower) and therefore is a ''ekakuta'' design,<ref name="kuta">Quote:"Depending on the number of towers, temples are classified as ''ekakuta'' (one), ''dvikuta'' (two), ''trikuta'' (three), ''chatushkuta'' (four) and ''panchakuta'' (five). The last two types are rare. Sometimes a ''trikuta'' temple is literally not ''trikuta'' as only the central of three shrines may have a superstructure", Foekema (1996), p25</ref> and has a closed ''mantapa'' (hall) that connects the sanctum to the large open ''[[mantapa]]''.

[[Image:Chikkamagalur Amruthapura kirthimukha retouched.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Kirthimukha]]'' decoration (demon faces) on ''[[Sikhara]]'' (tower) at Amruthapura]]

It is medium sized Hoysala temple and compares closely with the [[Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi]] in ''mandapa'' structure and size. The open ''mandapa'' has twenty nine bays,<ref name="bay">Quote:"A bay is a square or rectangular compartment in the hall, Foekema (1996) p36, p93</ref> and the closed ''mantapa'' has nine bays with a side porch that leads to a separate shrine on the south side.  The shrine is square in shape has the original superstructure (''[[sikhara]]'') which is richly adorned with sculptures of ''[[Kirthimukha]]s'' (demon faces), miniature decorative towers ([[aedicule]]). Below the superstructure, the usual panel of [[Hindu]] deities is absent. The base of the wall has five mouldings which according to art critic Foekema is an "older Hoysala style".<ref name="mould">Quote:"In a typical "older style" that was popular throughout most of the 12th century Hoysala temples, there is one set of [[eaves]] where the tower meets the wall of the shrine. The eaves runs all around the temple. Eaves is a projecting roof overhanging the temple wall. Below the eaves are decorated miniature towers on pilasters. Below these towers are the wall panels of Hindu Gods, Goddesses and their attendants. Below these panels are the five mouldings", Foekema (1996), p28</ref> The ''Sukanasi'', the tower on top of the [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] that connects the sanctum to the closed ''mantapa'' (the ''Sukanasi'' appears like the nose of the superstructure),<ref name="nose">Foekema(1996), p22</ref> has the original Hoysala emblem of "Sala" fighting the lion.<ref name="lion">Foekema (1996), p22</ref><ref name="sala">According to Kamath, Sala fights a tiger. According to historians such as C. Hayavadhana Rao, [[J Duncan M Derrett|J. D. M. Derrett]] and B. R Joshi, "Sala" was the mythical founder of the empire, Kamath (2001), p123</ref> 

The rows of shining lathe turned pillars that support the ceiling of the ''mantapa'' is a Hoysala-Chalukya decorative idiom.<ref name="lathe">Quote:"a common feature of Western Chalukya-Hoysala temples", Kamath (2001), p117</ref> The ''mantapa'' has many deeply domed inner ceiling structures adorned with floral designs. The outer parapet wall of the open ''mantapa'' has a total of hundred and forty panel sculptures with depictions from the Hindu epics. Unlike many Hoysala temples where the panels are small and carvings in miniature, these panels are comparatively larger. The [[Ramayana]] is sculpted on the south side wall on seventy panels, with the story proceeding quite unusually, in anti-clockwise direction. On the north side wall, all depictions are clockwise, a norm in Hoysala architectural articulation. Twenty five panels depict the life of the Hindu god [[Krishna]] and the remaining forty five panels depict scenes from the epic [[Mahabharata]].<ref name="lathe"/>

Ruvari Mallitamma, the famous sculptor and architect is known to have started his career here working on the domed ceilings in the main ''mantapa''.<ref name="mailtamma">''Architectural marvel'' by P.B.Premkumar, ''Spectrum'', Tuesday, January 20, 2004 [http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jan202004/spt6.asp]</ref> The large stone inscription near the porch is an excellent example of medieval Kannada poetry composed by the famous poet [[Janna]].
