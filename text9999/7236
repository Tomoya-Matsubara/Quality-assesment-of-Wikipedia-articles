This article provides a '''timeline of elections in [[Canada]]''', including all the [[provinces of Canada|provincial]], [[territories of Canada|territorial]] and federal elections. The information starts from when each province was formed or entered the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], and continues through to the present day. The background colour indicates which party won the election.  Several provinces held elections before joining Canada, but only their post-Confederation elections are shown.  These include:
*Ontario's [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|first 13 elections]] as [[Upper Canada]], from 1792 to 1840;
*Quebec's [[Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada|first 15 elections]] as [[Lower Canada]], from 1792 to 1840;
*the [[List of elections in the Province of Canada|8 joint elections]] of Ontario and Quebec as the [[Province of Canada]], from 1840 to Confederation;
*New Brunswick's [[General elections in New Brunswick (pre-Confederation)|first 21 elections]], beginning in 1785 (the 21st Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick was elected in 1866, one year before Confederation, and continued until 1870, three years after Confederation);
*Nova Scotia's [[List of Nova Scotia General Assemblies|first 23 elections]], beginning in 1758;
*Prince Edward Island's [[General elections in Prince Edward Island (pre-Confederation)|first 25 elections]], beginning in 1769; and
*Newfoundland's [[General elections in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation)|first 28 elections]], beginning in 1832.

The most recent election in most provinces is shown with a box equivalent to five years of government, as this the maximum length of office as set by the constitution.  However, elections can be called at any time by a provincial government. Three provinces have changed to fixed election dates every four years: British Columbia, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador.  For these three provinces, the box is shown as four years, but an election could still be earlier if the government falls due to a [[motion of no confidence]].

==Summary==
The table below shows how many elections each party has won in each province, and also in Yukon territory. It does not include results for Nunavut's elections (both non-partisan), or results for the Northwest Territories (only one of the twenty elections has been partisan, which was won by the [[Northwest Territories Liberal-Conservative Party|Conservatives]]). Of thirty-nine federal elections, twenty-three have won by the Liberals, fifteen have been by the Conservatives, and one by a coalition.
