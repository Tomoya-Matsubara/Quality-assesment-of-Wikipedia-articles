'''''GoldenEye 007''''' is a 1997 [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] [[video game console]], and based on the 1995 [[James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]''.

The game has received very positive reviews<ref name="gamerankings">{{cite web|title=GoldenEye 007 Reviews|publisher=gamerankings.com|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/197462.asp|accessdate=2006-01-29}}</ref> and sold over eight million copies.<ref name="8million">{{cite web|date=[[2002-09-24]] | url=http://www.rareware.com/company/press-microsoft1.html | title=Microsoft Acquires Video Game Powerhouse Rare Ltd | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> It is considered an important title in the development of first person shooters, and has become particularly well-known for the quality of its [[multiplayer]] [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] mode, as well as its incorporation of [[stealth-based game|stealth]] and varied objectives into its [[single player]] missions.

''GoldenEye 007'' was followed by a [[spiritual successor]], ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', also developed by Rare. The commercial successor was [[Tomorrow Never Dies (video game)|Tomorrow Never Dies]], developed by [[Electronic Arts]] for the [[PlayStation]].

== Development ==
''GoldenEye 007'' was originally announced for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]<ref>Nintendo Power Volume 71, page 108</ref> before being stepped up to the Nintendo 64.<ref name="007SNES">{{cite journal | year = 1995 | month = November | title = Goldeneye Steps Up To NU64 | journal = Nintendo Power | volume = 78 | pages = 112 |url = http://www.vr32.de/modules/articles/index.php?type=scans&show=33&page=11 | format = JPEG | accessdate = 2006-06-03}}</ref> The intention for the first few months of development was for the game to be an [[rail shooter|on-rails shooter]] similar to ''[[Virtua Cop]]''; it only became a first-person shooter later in development.<ref name="hollis-speech">{{cite web | last=Hollis | first=Martin | authorlink=Martin Hollis|date=[[2004-09-02]] | url=http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2004-09-02.php | title=The Making of GoldenEye 007 | publisher=Zoonami | accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref>

The development team working on ''GoldenEye 007'' was inexperienced; for all but two of them, the project was their first game. As [[David Doak]] explained, "Looking back, there are things I'd be wary of attempting now, but as none of the people working on the code, graphics and game design had worked on a game before, there was this joyful na<U+00EF>vete."<ref name="daviddoak">{{cite journal | year=2004 | month=July | title=Desert Island Disks: David Doak | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=6 | pages=41<U+2013>45 | id=ISSN 1742-3155 | url=http://www.livepublishing.co.uk/retro/retro6.shtml | format={{Dead link|date=June 2008}} &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3ADesert+Island+Disks%3A+David+Doak&as_publication=Retro+Gamer&as_ylo=2004&as_yhi=2004&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref>

The game is based upon the ''GoldenEye'' film and its [[novelization]] by [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], but, as game designer [[Martin Hollis]] explained, many of the missions were extended or modified to allow the player to participate in sequences of which Bond was not originally a part, or those in which he only played a minor role.<ref name="hollis-speech" /> The original [[set construction|sets]] that were created for the film were first converted into complete, believable environments by one group of game designers; when this process was complete, other designers began populating them with objectives, characters and obstacles in order to create a balanced and fun game. According to Martin Hollis, "many of the levels in the game have a realistic and non-linear feel. There are rooms with no direct relevance to the level. There are multiple routes across the level."<ref name="hollis-speech" /> Hollis also noted that the concept of several varied objectives within each level was inspired by the multiple tasks in each stage of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref name="hollis-speech" />

''GoldenEye'' was developed through two and a half years, but, according to Martin Hollis, only the last year was spent developing the game. During the beginning, the [[Game engine|engine]] was built, art assets were made, and the [[Game AI|enemy AI]] was written and polished.<ref name="hollis-speech" /> The game was delayed numerous times, partly because during development, the team decided to incorporate a multiplayer feature to the game to demonstrate the N64's 4-player capabilities.

In addition to the N64 game, a version of ''[[GoldenEye (Virtual Boy)|GoldenEye]]'' was in development for the [[Nintendo Virtual Boy]], but cancelled before release.<ref name="007SNES" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/index.php?type=unreleased&sec=main&id=6 | title=Planet Virtual Boy <nowiki>|</nowiki> Games - Unreleased - GoldenEye | publisher=Planet Virtual Boy | accessdate=2007-01-08}}</ref>

== Gameplay and design ==
[[Image:GE007dossier.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A mission dossier for the Aztec level in ''GoldenEye 007''. The red crosshair used to navigate the menus is also used as an aiming indicator in the game itself.]]
''GoldenEye 007'''s menu system is presented as an [[MI6]] [[dossier]].<ref>The letters "OHMSS" appear on each of the menu dossiers, in a reference to the term [[O.H.M.S.]] and the James Bond novel and film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.</ref> Four [[saved game|save files]] are available to track the player's progress through the game's twenty [[Level (computer and video games)|missions]], each of which may be played on either "Agent," "Secret Agent," "[[Licence to kill (concept)|00-Agent]]," or "007" difficulty settings, with higher difficulties requiring the player to complete additional and more complex objectives. [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], and [[Miss Moneypenny]] provide background information on the chosen mission and its goals.<ref name="vg">{{cite video game| title = [[GoldenEye 007]]|developer = Rare|publisher = [[Nintendo]]| date =|platform = [[Nintendo 64]]| language = English}}</ref> 

Once a mission is completed, the player may either continue progressing through the story or choose to replay a previously completed level. Completing certain missions within particular target times enables the player to unlock bonus [[cheat code|cheat]] options which make various changes to the graphics and gameplay, and upon fully completing the game on the 00-Agent difficulty level, an additional "007" setting allows the player to customize the challenge of any mission.<ref name="vg"/>

The player's initial weapon in most missions is the PP7, an equivalent of James Bond's [[Walther PPK]]. Most of the game's firearms are modelled on real-life counterparts, while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the [[Golden Gun]] and [[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]] [[Directed-energy weapon#Lasers|laser]]. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit.<ref>{{cite web | title=The GoldenEye Arms Reference | publisher= Rhodes Mill |url=http://www.rhodesmill.org/goldeneye/index.html | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> [[Stealth-based game|Stealth]] is an important element of the game: in order to avoid gunfights with multiple opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons may be powerful enough to shoot through doors and helmets but are very loud, while others incorporate [[suppressor]] or [[zoom lens]] attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly.

Some [[List of James Bond gadgets|gadgets]] from the James Bond film series are featured in the game and are often used to complete particular mission objectives; for example, 007's in-game watch includes both the laser from the ''[[GoldenEye]]'' film, the remote mine detonator from ''[[GoldenEye]]'' and ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', and the [[Rolex Submariner#Submariner in film|electromagnet]] from ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''.<ref name="vg"/> 

=== Multiplayer mode ===
The multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis noted that the setting was "a complete afterthought".<ref name="hollis-speech" /> According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned ''GoldenEye'' into a multiplayer game."<ref name="daviddoak" />

The multiplayer mode features all of the characters in the game, including enemies and civilians. At first, only 12 characters are available, with 21 more becoming available as progress is made through the game. A button code allows players to temporarily unlock another 31 characters, all but two of them likenesses of the programmers.<ref name="guide book">{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Nintendo Power |others= |title=Goldeneye 007 64 Game and Official Guide Combo |origdate= |origyear=[[1995]] |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate=21 |accessyear=[[2007]] |accessmonth=08 |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Nintendo |location= |language= English |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> Variations between characters' heights and builds can affect the challenge of shooting them; for example, there is a significant difference between defeating [[List of James Bond henchmen in Goldfinger#Oddjob|Oddjob]] and [[List of James Bond henchmen in The Spy Who Loved Me#Jaws|Jaws]].<ref name="vg"/>

As with the selectable characters, only a few arenas are available at first, with more becoming available as progress is made in the game. There are eleven arenas, not counting levels that can only be accessed with a [[GameShark]], and a "random" button that chooses the level randomly. The multiplayer-only arenas are: Temple, Complex, Caves, Library, Basement, and Stack. Several arenas are taken from the single player mode, with alterations such as restrictions on which sections of the map can be used - they are the Facility, Bunker, Archives, Caverns, and Egyptian.<ref name="guide book"/>

The multiplayer mode features five general scenarios, within which options such as weapon schemes may be altered. Weapon selections in the multiplayer mode are grouped by type, such as [[handgun|pistols]], [[automatic firearm|automatics]], and [[explosive material|explosives]]. Other selectable weapon schemes focus on weapons not frequently found in the single player mode, such as [[raygun|laser guns]], [[knife throwing#The throwing knife|throwing knives]] or the one-hit kill [[Golden Gun]]. The "Slappers Only!" setting removes all projectiles, limiting players to [[hand to hand combat|hand-to-hand combat]].<ref name="vg"/>

;Normal: A basic free-for-all [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] mode, in which players attempt to kill their opponents as many times as possible within a set amount of time. This mode can also be played in teams of 2 versus 1, 2 versus 2, and 3 versus 1.

;You Only Live Twice: Similar to Normal mode, except players only have two lives before they are eliminated from the game.

;The Living Daylights [Flag Tag]: In this adaptation of the playground game "[[Tag (game)|Tag]]", a flag or "token" is placed in a fixed location on the map. The player who holds it the longest wins the match. A player cannot use weapons while holding the flag (although it is still possible to slap), but can still collect them to keep opponents from stocking ammunition.<ref name="guide book"/>

;The Man With the Golden Gun: A single [[Golden Gun]] is placed in a fixed location on the map. Players must locate and obtain the Golden Gun, which is capable of killing opponents with only one shot regardless of where they are hit, even if they are wearing body armor. After a player acquires the Golden Gun, others are able to see him or her indicated by a blue dot on their [[radar]]. The player with the Golden Gun is unable to pick up body armor while opponents can. The only way to obtain the Golden Gun after its removal from the spawn point is to kill the player holding it retrieve it from the corpse.<ref name="guide book"/>

;Licence to Kill: All attacks, including "slapping", will kill opponents in one hit. This mode cannot be played in teams, unlike the other scenarios.

=== Easter Eggs ===
Several references to James Bond films exist in ''GoldenEye 007'', the most apparent being the titles of the various multiplayer modes and the [[Bond Girl]] names for the game's control schemes. The [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] tape found in the second Bunker mission features the cover of the [[VHS]] release of the ''GoldenEye'' film.<ref name="detstarbondref">{{cite web | url=http://goldeneye.detstar.com/bondreferences/bondreferences.asp | title=Bond Film References | work=[http://www.detstar.com Detstar] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

Several members of the game's development staff were featured in the game as generic character faces. Bond's double-agent contact "Dr. Doak" in the "Facility" mission is named after and bears the likeness of [[David Doak]]. The "Klobb" weapon (originally "Spyder"), is named after former Nintendo employee [[Ken Lobb]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://goldeneye.detstar.com/mysteries/solved.asp | title=Solved Mysteries | work=[http://www.detstar.com Detstar] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

== Storyline ==
Like the movie, ''GoldenEye 007'' starts in [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]] during the mid-1980s, where MI6 has uncovered a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond is sent to infiltrate the facility by [[bungee jump]]ing from the dam, then join his friend and fellow 00-agent [[Alec Trevelyan]] in destroying the factory. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by [[List of James Bond henchmen in GoldenEye#Ourumov|Colonel Arkady Ourumov]], but Bond escapes by commandeering an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]].

The following missions depict 007's investigation of the satellite control station in [[Severnaya Zemlya|Severnaya, Russia]] where [[Natalya Simonova]] and [[List of James Bond henchmen in GoldenEye#Boris Grishenko|Boris Grishenko]] work, a location he did not visit in the film. Entirely new to the game is the "[[missile silo|Silo]]" mission in which Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in [[Kyrgyzstan]], believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as ''GoldenEye''. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range; from its orbit, it would be a threat to any city on earth.

[[Image:Goldeneyeemulated4lw.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Bond holding the silenced PP7 in the Bunker level. The red bar indicates that the player took a hit.]]
Bond's visit to [[Monte Carlo]] and investigation of the [[frigate]] ''[[La Fayette (F710)|La Fayette]]'' and the [[Eurocopter Tiger]] (referred to as the "Pirate" in the game) were featured in the film, but here they are expanded, with Bond rescuing several hostages inside the ship and planting a tracker bug on the helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with [[Natalya Simonova]] <U+2014> this meeting takes place much earlier than in the film. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the ''GoldenEye'' satellite's EMP.

As in the film, Bond next travels to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he arranges with ex-[[KGB]] agent [[List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky|Valentin Zukovsky]] to meet the chief of the Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan <U+2014> his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military [[archive]]s for interrogation. The player must escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya and communicate with Defence Minister [[List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye#Dimitri Mishkin|Dimitri Mishkin]], who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery.

Natalya is captured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase with a [[tank]] through the streets of Saint Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus <U+2014> the player must destroy its weaponry stores, then hitch a ride on Trevelyan's Soviet [[armoured train|missile train]]. This section features many departures from the film storyline, where Bond does not reach the depot, and only enters the train after stopping it with the tank. Bond makes his way through the train, killing Ouromov and rescuing Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally [[List of James Bond henchmen in GoldenEye#Xenia Onatopp|Xenia Onatopp]] escape to their secret base in [[Cuba]].

Natalya accompanies Bond to the Caribbean. Surveying the Cuban jungle aerially, their light aircraft is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground search of the area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control center to disrupt transmissions to the ''GoldenEye'' satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. An original mission shows Bond following the fleeing Trevelyan through a series of flooded [[cavern]]s, which conceal a [[Satellite Dish]] under water. He then arrives at the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] of the control centre's [[radio telescope]]. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the ''GoldenEye''. Bond destroys machinery vital to controlling the dish and kills Trevelyan in a precarious firefight high above the dish.

=== Additional missions ===
Two further missions unrelated to the ''GoldenEye'' film were included as bonuses for the completion of the game on higher difficulties. The first, "[[Aztec]] Complex", is partially based on the James Bond film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', and is unlocked when the player completes all 18 missions on Secret Agent difficulty. During the mission, Bond is sent to the Aztec complex in [[Teotihuac<U+00E1>n]] to investigate the [[Hugo Drax|Drax Corporation's]] unlicensed space exploration in which at least one [[space shuttle]] was stolen from [[NASA]]. Although Hugo Drax was killed by Bond in the movie, it has seemed that his corporation still existed after his death due to remnants and fragments that were still active. MI6 believes their intentions with the shuttle in space are militant in nature and authorizes Bond to [[Computer program|reprogram]] the shuttle's guidance computer so that MI6 can take control of the craft once it reaches orbit. During the mission, [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] makes a return in an effort to stop Bond from completing his mission. Many of the rooms in the mission were from the movie and included several new features, such as the launch room for the ''Moonraker'' shuttle.<ref name="guide book">{{cite book |last= R. |first=Kimber |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Goldeneye Secrets, Strategies and Solutions |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date=[[November 10]], [[1997]] |publisher=Paragon Publishing |location= |isbn=1873650116 |id= |pages= |chapter= |quote= }}</ref> 

The second bonus level, "Egyptian Temple", blends elements from the films ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' and ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''. To access this level players must complete all 18 missions on 00 Agent difficulty.<ref name="guide book"/> Prior to the mission, M informs Bond that a person claiming to be [[List of James Bond henchmen in Live and Let Die#Baron Samedi|Baron Samedi]] is in possession of the deceased [[Francisco Scaramanga]]'s legendary "Golden Gun" pistol. Samedi has invited James Bond to the El-Saghira temple in the [[Valley of the Kings]] to retrieve it. Knowing it is a trap, M sends Bond regardless to take possession of the Golden Gun and eliminate Baron Samedi. Although the player "kills" Samedi three times during the level, he can be seen laughing in an end-of-level cut scene, similar to the ending of ''Live and Let Die''.

== Unfinished features ==
=== Citadel ===
[[GameShark]] users found several text references to a level called "Citadel" in the game. Rare explained its nature, and joked about players' speculation that multiplayer-mode Bond characters could be seen in the single-player game: "'Citadel' was a very rough test level designed during the early stages of multiplayer mode. It is not in the finished game in any shape or form, and [[Oddjob]] and [[May Day (James Bond)|Mayday]] would not be in it if it was."<ref name="rareresponse">{{cite web | url=http://www.rarenet.com/wiki/index.php?title=Rare's_Official_Response_to_GoldenEye_Rumors | title=Rare's Official Response to GoldenEye Rumors | publisher=RareNet.com | accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref>

It was thought that a few textual references were all that remained of the level. In 2004, ''GoldenEye 007'' fan sites uncovered an unplayable but viewable single-player version of the level (with implemented sky and water textures).<ref name="detstar-citadel">{{cite web | url=http://goldeneye.detstar.com/beta/thecitadel.asp | title=The Famous Missing Citadel Level | accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref>

In 2005, the website ''GoldenEye Forever'' revealed that it was possible to access a fully playable multiplayer version by linking a GameShark to a [[personal computer|computer]].<ref name="Goldeneye Citadel in Multiplayer">{{cite web | url=http://www.goldeneyeforever.com/goldeneye_citadel.php | title=Goldeneye_Citadel | accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref>
The codes to access Citadel in its fullest state totaled nearly 10,000 lines. The test map is largely a mass of shapes and ramps that the players can climb upon, thus giving players many opportunities for sniping and for hiding.<ref name="geforever-citadel">{{cite web | url=http://goldeneyeforever.com/level%20files/citadel_multiplayer_temp.htm | title=Citadel | accessdate=2007-01-16}}</ref>

=== All Bonds ===
[[Image:Returnofallbonds.jpg|right|thumb|313px|All Bonds face/suit mapping created with ''GoldenEye ROM Editor'']]
Before ''GoldenEye 007'' was released, Rare had placed a feature in the multiplayer mode of the game, known as the "All Bonds" option.<ref name="detstar-allbonds">{{cite web | url=http://goldeneye.detstar.com/beta/allbonds.asp | title=The 'All Bonds' Characters | accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> This would allow players to choose four of the five actors (at the time of the game) who had portrayed Bond in various films; [[Sean Connery]], [[Roger Moore]], [[Timothy Dalton]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]]. [[George Lazenby]] was not included. However, before the game was released, Rare removed the feature for unexplained reasons. It is assumed that Rare had every intention to release the game with the feature, but was later forced to remove it (possibly due to legal problems with [[EON Productions]], [[Danjaq, LLC]], or the other Bond actors themselves). In response, Rare said "Yes, it was the hope of the team that [all Bonds] would be available to play, but for various reasons they weren't."<ref name="rareresponse" />

In addition, the actors' portraits were at one point used to illustrate the four single-player save file dossiers; this was also removed, with Pierce Brosnan's portrait appearing on all four in the final version.

Not all remnants of the All Bonds feature were completely removed from the ''GoldenEye'' software. One major clue was the fact that the portraits of the four Bonds in the selection screen for multiplayer mode were accessible by using a [[GameShark]]. Also, various screenshots in the game manual, such as one from the multiplayer selection screen, show traces of the former Bond portraits. The follow-up game, ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', also contains traces of the All Bonds cheat <U+2014> there are four tuxedo characters available in multiplayer, corresponding to the four suits seen in the Beta version screenshots, which were used in Perfect Dark for the "Dinner Jacket" characters.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://goldeneye.detstar.com/beta/allbonds.asp | title=All Bonds at Detstar.com | work=Detstar | date=2007-05-05 }}</ref> The James Bond head used in the Aztec and Egyptian bonus levels of ''GoldenEye 007'' is not the same as the one from the standard missions.

The feature was brought to the attention of many gamers when the [[video game magazine|gaming magazine]] ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' published an April issue with what they called the "All Bonds Cheat", using some fake screenshots "to support" its claim. The magazine reported that to unlock the option in the cheat menu, a player must complete the Aztec mission on 007 difficulty in less than nine minutes with all customisable enemy settings on the highest difficulty. The claim was later found to be an [[April Fools]] prank, which the magazine held annually.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

In 2005, a program called the GoldenEye ROM Editor was released by The Rare Witch Project.<ref name="romeditor">{{cite web | url=http://www.rarewitchproject.com | title=The Rare Witch Project | accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> The coders SubDrag and Ice Mario cracked the compression format of the images used by the game, allowing any image in the game's memory to be viewed and edited, by opening up a [[ROM image]] of the game. It was then discovered that the All Bonds faces and suits are still in the game; Rare had only removed the ability to use them. By mapping them onto other multiplayer characters' faces and bodies, one can try to recreate All Bonds, although since the body and head shapes do not match the textures, it will not look as it was intended.

When ''GoldenEye 007'' was released in 1997, its stealth elements and varied objectives contrasted with the approaches taken by ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake]]'', and its [[split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] deathmatch mode proved popular, selling eight million copies.<ref name="8million" />

Along with [[Shiny Entertainment]]'s ''[[MDK (game)|MDK]]'', ''GoldenEye'' is credited with popularizing the video game convention of a [[zoom lens|zoomable]] [[sniper rifle]] on consoles, enabling players to kill oblivious enemies from vast distances away with a single, precise [[headshot]]; context-sensitive enemy hit-locations were also pioneered by the game for console games that followed.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

In [[1998]], ''GoldenEye'' received the [[BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards|BAFTA Interactive Entertainment]] "Games Award" and Rare won the award for "Best UK Developer".<!-- The following referenced PDF file on the BAFTA awards site is no longer available at that URL.<ref name="baftawinners">{{cite web | url=http://www.bafta.org/site/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/import/Interactive_Awards_Winners_1998-2005.pdf | title=BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards | format=PDF | pages=1 | publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts | accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref>--><ref name="rareawards">{{cite web | url=http://rareware.co.uk/company/awards2.html | title=Rare: Company Awards | publisher=Rare | accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref><ref name="awards-bbc">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/204258.stm | title=UK Interactive industry comes of age  | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=[[1998-10-30]] | accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> It also won four awards from the [[Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences]]: "Console Action Game of the Year", "Console Game of the Year", "Interactive Title of the Year" and "Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering".

The game continues to be played by fans, many of whom have developed [[online communities]] based around popular aspects of the game. There are those who enjoy replaying single-player levels in an attempt to achieve fast times, those who battle others in its deathmatch mode, while others use [[GameShark]]s and similar devices to examine and to modify the game's code. On [[October 25]], [[2006]], a fansite, The Rare Witch Project, released a [[level editor]] that allows users to place objects and write AI routines for existing stages on a [[ROM image]], so new stages can be developed.<ref name="setupeditor">{{cite web | url=http://www.rarewitchproject.com/?id=1429 | title= Goldeneye Setup Editor |publisher=[http://www.rarewitchproject.com/ The Rare Witch Project] | accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref>

== Sequels ==
===''Perfect Dark''===
{{main|Perfect Dark}}
Following the success of ''GoldenEye 007'', Rare commenced work on a similar-style [[first-person shooter]], titled ''[[Perfect Dark]]''. It was decided that this game would use an enhanced version of the ''GoldenEye 007'' engine but would be a completely new franchise that would be owned by Rare. For this reason, when ''Perfect Dark'' was eventually released for the [[Nintendo 64|N64]] in 2000 after numerous delays, it was marketed and [[hype]]d as a "[[spiritual sequel]]" to ''GoldenEye''. Although it has no official Bond license, it features many references to 007 and the former game: the four "[[dinner jacket]]" characters strongly resemble the [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedos]] that were worn by [[Sean Connery]], [[Roger Moore]], [[Timothy Dalton]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]]; the BAFTA Interactive award that Rare received for work on the previous game can be found hidden in a [[Bank vault|vault]] in one level; several of the maps from ''GoldenEye'' return for use in ''Perfect Dark'''s deathmatch mode. In 2005, David Doak commented, "''GoldenEye'' pretty much exhausted the performance of the machine. It was hard to push it further. ''Perfect Dark'' had some good ideas but was dog slow."<ref name="daviddoak" />

===Free Radical Design's ''TimeSplitters''===
A number of the ''GoldenEye 007'' team left Rare soon after development on ''Perfect Dark'' commenced, beginning with Martin Hollis in 1998, who after working on the [[GameCube]] at [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]] formed his own company [[Zoonami]] in 2000.<ref name="martinhollis">{{cite web | url=http://www.zoonami.com/dossier/profile_of_martin_hollis.php | title=Profile of Martin Hollis | publisher=Zoonami|accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> Other members formed [[Free Radical Design]], and four of the team of nine who originally worked on ''GoldenEye 007'' are now employed there, including David Doak, Karl Hilton and Steve Ellis. This company's most prominent creations are the ''[[TimeSplitters (series)|TimeSplitters]]'' series of first-person shooters, which are considered by some to be,{{Fact|date=May 2008}} like ''Perfect Dark'', "spiritual sequels" to the original game. The ''TimeSplitters'' series contains many references to ''GoldenEye 007'';{{Fact|date=May 2008}} the design of the health-[[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]], the nature of the aiming system and the dam setting of the opening level of the [[TimeSplitters 2|second game]] are among the more obvious.

===EA Games===
The James Bond game license was acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1999, which published new games based upon the then-recent James Bond films ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (video game)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' and ''[[The World Is Not Enough (video game)|The World Is Not Enough]]''. The latter game, along with others published by EA such as ''[[Agent Under Fire (video game)|Agent Under Fire]]'' and ''[[Nightfire]]'' are similar in style to ''GoldenEye 007''.

In the autumn of 2004, Electronic Arts released ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' for [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]] and later the [[Nintendo DS]]. This is the first game based on the 007 franchise in which the player does not take on the role of James Bond himself; rather they control an aspiring 00-agent (named [[GoldenEye (character)|GoldenEye]]) who is recruited by [[Auric Goldfinger]], the [[List of James Bond villains|villain]] in the movie and book ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]''. The game has little to do with either the film ''GoldenEye'' or the N64 game. It was released to mediocre reviews,<ref name="metacritic">[[Metacritic]] review scores for [http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/goldeneyerogueagent?q=goldeneye%20rogue%20agent PlayStation 2], [http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/cube/goldeneyerogueagent?q=goldeneye%20rogue%20agent GameCube] and [http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/goldeneyerogueagent?q=goldeneye%20rogue%20agent Xbox] versions of ''GoldenEye: Rogue Agent''</ref> and was criticized for using the "GoldenEye" name in an attempt to exploit the success of Rare's game.<ref name="Rogue Agent PS2">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/jamesbond007goldeneye2/review.html | title=PlayStation 2 ''Goldeneye: Rogue Agent'' Review | publisher= GameSpot| accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref><ref name="IGN: Goldeneye:Rogue Agent Review">{{cite web | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/568/568340p1.html | title=IGN: ''GoldenEye: Rogue Agent'' Review| accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref><ref name="Goldeneye:Rogue Agent Review">{{cite web | url=http://xbox.about.com/od/reviews/fr/goldeneyerarev.htm | title=''GoldenEye: Rogue Agent'' Review| accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref><ref name="Gamespy: ''Goldeneye:Rogue Agent'' Review">{{cite web | url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/james-bond-007-goldeneye-2/568337p1.html | title=GameSpy: ''GoldenEye: Rogue Agent'' Review| accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref>

===Activision===
In the aftermath of E3 2006 [[Activision]] obtained the rights for James Bond games from MGM and EON,<ref>{{cite web | first=Ben | last=Fritz | title=Action traction: Bond, Superman games on the move | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942524?categoryid=18&cs=1 | publisher=Variety | date=[[2006-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> and a "next-gen" game is currently in the works by subsidiary [[Treyarch]].<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6154103.html Treyarch has 007's next-gen number], [[GameSpot]], 14-07-2006</ref>

===GoldenEye: Source===
{{main|GoldenEye: Source}}
GoldenEye: Source is a fan made [[Mod (computer gaming)#Total conversion|total conversion mod]] using the [[Source engine]] and based on ''GoldenEye 007''. In January of 2007, it was awarded twice in the 2006 annual [[Mod DB#Mod of the Year|Moddb awards]], a win in Editor's Choice<ref>[http://www.moddb.com/features/23825/mods-of-2006-editors-choice/2 Editor's Choice - Mod of the year]</ref> for the Reinvention category, and was player-voted 3rd place in the overall category Mod of the year.<ref>[http://www.moddb.com/features/23824/mods-of-2006-players-choice/2 3rd place - Mod of the year]</ref> On  [[2007]], one of the developers released an unofficial patch.

===''GoldenEye 007'' ports=== 
The President of Nintendo of America, [[Reggie Fils-Aime]], announced that Nintendo is exploring the possibility of adding ''GoldenEye 007'' to the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]], despite a complicated situation in which the game's developer Rare is owned by [[Microsoft]] (producers of the rival [[Xbox 360]] console) and the video game rights to the James Bond franchise are held by Activision. He stated, "We would love to see it [on the Virtual Console], so we're exploring all the rights issues."<ref name="wiivirtualconsole">{{cite web | last =Totilo | first =Stephen | title =Nintendo Exec Predicts Wii Future, Chances Of 'GoldenEye' On Console | publisher =MTV.com | date =[[November 28]], [[2006]] | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1546730/20061128/id_0.jhtml | accessdate =2007-06-29}} Summary of article available at "[http://www.n-europe.com/news.php?nid=9822 N-Europe: News: Reggie Discusses Wii's Future]".</ref>

On [[January 11]], [[2008]], [[1UP.com]] reported that a ''GoldenEye'' port (as opposed to a remake) had been in development at Rare for several months, but stated that the title would not be released on Xbox Live Arcade since "Microsoft and Nintendo couldn't agree on the financial side of things."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3165391 | title = Why did GoldenEye XBLA stall? | accessdate = 2008-01-13 | last = Klepek | first = Patrick | date = [[2008-01-11]] | work = [[1UP.com]] | publisher = [[Ziff Davis|Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc.]] }}</ref>
