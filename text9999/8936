'''Theodore "Eibon" Donald Klein''' (born [[1947]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[horror fiction|horror]] [[writer]] and [[editing|editor]]. 

Klein has published very few works, but they have all achieved positive notice for their meticulous construction and subtle use of horror: critic [[S. T. Joshi]] writes, "In close to 25 years of writing Klein has only two books and a handful of scattered tales to his credit, and yet his achievement towers gigantically over that of his more prolific contemporaries." (Joshi, 114)

==Biography==
He was born and lives in [[New York City]] and attended [[Brown University]] where he became a fan of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. He was the editor of ''[[Twilight Zone literature|Twilight Zone]]'' magazine from its inception in 1981 until 1985, and served as editor of the short-lived [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] magazine ''CrimeBeat'' from 1991 to 1993. He has also taught English at New York's [[John Jay College]].

He added "[[Eibon]]" to his name--a reference to [[Clark Ashton Smith]]'s [[Hyperborean cycle|Hyperborean]] wizard--so that when he used his initials in his byline, ala H. P. Lovecraft or [[M. R. James]], they would spell out his nickname "Ted".

==Writings==

He first attracted notice with the [[novella]] "[[The Events at Poroth Farm]]" (1972), in which a college lecturer, isolated in the countryside and reading horror literature for teaching in the next semester, gradually realises that genuine supernatural horror is taking place around him. The story is notable for the insidious way in which the narrator's responses to the works he is reading (including those of [[Charles Robert Maturin]], [[Ann Radcliffe]], [[Monk Lewis]], [[Le Fanu]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Aleister Crowley]], and [[Shirley Jackson]]) are conflated with his impressions of the supernatural threat. 

In 1984 Klein published the [[novel]] ''[[The Ceremonies]]'', which uses the same basic plot as the novella to more expansive ends; the threat this time is not to one man or one community, but to the entire world. A literate, sophisticated and atmospheric work, ''The Ceremonies'' takes up and elaborates imaginatively upon some of the mysteries of [[Arthur Machen]]'s story [["The White People"]] and is called "a modern classic" in an essay by [[Thomas F. Monteleone]] in the book ''Horror: 100 Best Books''. A second novel, ''Nighttown'', was announced by Klein soon afterwards and described by him as "a paranoid horror novel set entirely in New York City", but has not appeared.

In 1985 Klein published the [[Anthology|collection]] ''[[Dark Gods]]'', which includes four novellas: "[[Children of the Kingdom]]", which dealt with [[hollow earth]] lore and hostile creatures hiding in the shadows of New York and was first published in the anthology ''[[Dark Forces (book)|Dark Forces]]''; "[[Petey (short story)|Petey]]", about a madman's monstrous "pet" which brings a well-to-do, middle-class housewarming to an unpleasant conclusion; "[[Black Man with a Horn]]", a tale in the vein of Lovecraft which treats of an elderly horror writer (modelled on [[Frank Belknap Long]]) and his discoveries about the dreaded [[Tcho-Tcho]] people; and "[[Nadelman's God]]", about a man who finds that a poem he wrote as an adolescent has been used as an incantation to bring a monstrous deity to life.

Klein also wrote the [[screenplay]] for [[Dario Argento]]'s 1993 film ''Trauma'', which starred [[Asia Argento]] and [[Piper Laurie]].

Klein has written two critical essays on weird fiction: ''[[Abraham Van Helsing|Dr Van Helsing]]'s Handy Guide to Ghost Stories'' (1981), a series of articles for ''Twilight Zone'' magazine; and ''Raising Goosebumps for Fun and Profit'' (1988), originally written for ''[[Writer's Digest]]''. A critical essay on Klein's own work can be found in S. T. Joshi's book.

Klein has himself blamed his limited output of fiction on [[writer's block]]. He revealed in the book ''[[Faces of Fear (interview book)|Faces of Fear]]'' that he had struggled with ''The Ceremonies'' for more than five years before finally finishing it, and added: "I'm one of those people who will do anything to avoid writing. Anything!"
