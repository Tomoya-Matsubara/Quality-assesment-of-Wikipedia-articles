'''''Jamila dan Sang Presiden''''' (released internationally as '''''Jamila and the President''''') is a 2009 [[Cinema of Indonesia|Indonesian film]] directed by [[Ratna Sarumpaet]] and starring [[Atiqah Hasiholan]] and [[Christine Hakim]]. It follows the story of a [[Prostitution in Indonesia|prostitute]] sentenced to death for killing a government minister.

The film was adapted from a stage play entitled ''Pelacur dan Sang Presiden'' (''The Prostitute and the President''), which Sarumpaet had written after receiving a grant from [[UNICEF]] to study child trafficking trends in Indonesia and promote awareness of the problem. In preparing the script, she spent several months interviewing prostitutes in several cities; the film itself spent three years in production and featured much of the same cast and crew as the original play. 

Released on 30 April 2009, the film received mixed to positive reception in Indonesia. Internationally the film featured in several film festivals and won awards in France, Italy, and Taiwan. It was [[List of Indonesian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|submitted]] to the [[82nd Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], but not nominated.

==Plot==
''Jamila dan Sang Presiden'' opens with narration from Jamila ([[Atiqah Hasiholan]]), a victim of [[human trafficking]], followed by several scenes showing her living a glamorous yet unfulfilling night life. After hearing a news report that a government minister, Nurdin (Adjie Pangestu), has been murdered, Jamila surrenders herself to the police. This surprises her would-be boyfriend, Ibrahim (Dwi Sasono), who feels badly for Jamila and begins working towards freeing her. Under the orders of the [[President of Indonesia|president]], Jamila is placed in a prison outside [[Jakarta]], where she receives rough treatment at the hands of the guards and warden, Ria ([[Christine Hakim]]).

In the prison, Ria reads Jamila's diary and learns her backstory. Jamila was [[child trafficking|sold by her mother]] to a middleman, who then sold her to a rich family. While living with the family, Jamila is raped by both the father and son in succession; Jamila kills the son and runs away, while the mother ([[Jajang C. Noer]]), aware of their actions, kills her husband.  Jamila becomes a worker at a market, but once again must escape when she learns that some local men plan to rape her. She escapes to a discotheque, and when it is raided by the police she is thought to be a prostitute and arrested. After being released, Jamila is raised by a kind-hearted prostitute named Susi (Ria Irawan), who was also caught in the raid.

In the present day, several groups are demanding that Jamila be given the death sentence. One male guard, (Surya Saputra), takes pity on Jamila and tries to help her. However, Jamila ignores him. Ria, although slowly becoming more sympathetic to Jamila, gets into an argument with her over Nurdin's murder; this results in Jamila being placed in [[solitary confinement|isolation]].

Several days later, the court finds Jamila guilty of murder and sentences her to death, a sentence which will be carried out in 36 hours. Ria visits Jamila in her cell to check on her, and Ria explains that she intends to ask the president for a [[Stay of execution|stay]]. Jamila refuses, then tells Ria about her experience looking for her sister Fatimah in [[Borneo]], how she killed the man who had put Fatimah in a brothel but was unable to find her sister.

The day before Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic involvement with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child and insisted that he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin told her he was marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in [[self-defence]], Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the president has not responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and [[prostitution in Indonesia|prostitution]] are shown.

==Production==

This research carried over into the film.{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2009, A Portrait of Human}} 

Sarumpaet cast her daughter, Atiqah Hasiholan, in the lead role.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2010, Sarumpaet bags two}} Initially Hasiholan viewed her character as a "regular slutty prostitute", but after thinking of the character more thoroughly, she considered Jamila a "victim of life".{{sfn|Febrina 2009, A gray world}} To better play her character, Hasiholan visited several prostitution districts and spoke with sex workers there, learning their motivations; she drew the conclusion that poverty was a deciding factor.{{sfn|Arianto 2009, Demi Jamila, Atiqah}} Senior actress [[Christine Hakim]]{{spaced ndash}} a close friend of Sarumpaet's{{spaced ndash}} was cast as Ria; it was her first antagonistic role.{{sfn|Dursin and Alia 2007, Ratna Sarumpaet: The agony}} Sarumpaet's brother Sam was assistant director, and helped calm his sister when technical glitches occurred.{{sfn|Yazid 2009, Atiqah Hasiholan: Her}}

Much of the cast and crew, including star Hasiholan, had previously acted in the stage play.{{sfn|Yazid 2009, A very irresistible 'Jamila'}}{{sfn|Yazid 2009, Atiqah Hasiholan: Her}} Sarumpaet reported that the film cost [[Indonesian Rupiah|Rp.]]6.5 billion (US$ 800,000) to produce;{{sfn|Hidayah 2009, Jamila tanpa Presiden}} She originally had difficulty finding sponsors.{{sfn|Dursin and Alia 2007, Ratna Sarumpaet: The agony}} The film spent three years in production.{{sfn|Hidayah 2009, Jamila tanpa Presiden}}

==Themes==
Sarumpaet described the film as being "about how awful the effect of poverty on human<U+2019>s morality and lives is";{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2009, 'Jamila dan Sang Presiden'}} in an interview with [[Tempo (Indonesian magazine)|''Tempo'' magazine]], she stated that she did not have a political message, but intended to just show the facts.{{sfn|Hidayah 2009, Ratna Sarumpaet: Anak-anak}} Nauval Yazid, in a review for ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', wrote that the film was of the "women-who-suffer-continuously" genre, common in [[Indonesian cinema]]; he compared the theme to ''Ponirah Terpidana'' (''Ponirah is Convicted''; 1984), starring Hakim and [[Slamet Rahardjo]].{{sfn|Yazid 2009, A very irresistible 'Jamila'}} Anissa S. Febrina, also writing for ''The Jakarta Post'', described the film as depicting "the grim reality of those whose existence [viewers] are rarely aware of: victims of child and women trafficking."{{sfn|Febrina 2009, A gray world}}

==Style==

A review for the ''[[Jakarta Globe]]'' notes that the film has a "spartan feel", as supported by its cinematography.{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2009, A Portrait of Human}} It uses periods of silence to evoke an emotional response from viewers, with flashbacks used to drive the story.{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2009, A Portrait of Human}} The president is never shown; instead, he is represented by long shots of [[Merdeka Palace]], a presidential residence in Jakarta.{{sfn|Hidayah 2009, Jamila tanpa Presiden}}

Yazid wrote that the film was "easily one of the most noteworthy Indonesian films in recent years" and praised Hakim's acting; however, he found Hasiholan's acting overly theatrical.{{sfn|Yazid 2009, A very irresistible 'Jamila'}} A review for the ''Jakarta Globe'' described the film as "engaging because of its dramatic subject and well-measured pace", but ultimately leaving the audience with unanswered questions due to the number of characters introduced.{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2009, A Portrait of Human}} Marcel Thee and Armando Siahaan, writing in the same newspaper in December 2009, selected ''Jamila dan Sang Presiden'' as the best Indonesian film of 2009, noting that the titular character's struggle "provides an emotional roller-coaster ride."{{sfn|Thee and Siahaan 2009, Three Cheers for the Top}} Aguslia Hidayah, writing for ''Tempo'', stated the film came across as without a climax, with Hasiholan's acting at times overly theatrical and Hakim's coming across flat.{{sfn|Hidayah 2009, Jamila tanpa Presiden}} Eko Hendrawan Sofyan, reviewing for ''[[Kompas]]'', wrote that the film reminded viewers that poverty and prostitution were still major issues, and had to be dealt with before Indonesia could further develop.{{sfn|Sofyan 2009, Suara Getir Sang}}
