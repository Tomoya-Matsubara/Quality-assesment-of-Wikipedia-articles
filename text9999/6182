==History==
In 1843, Ygnacio Coronel was granted a property he called La Ca<U+00F1>ada Atras de Rancho Los Verdugos ("canyon behind the Verdugo ranch").<ref>[http://www.rancholacanada.com/  Rancho La Canada: Then and Now]</ref>  [[Jose Maria Verdugo#Julio Verdugo|Julio Verdugo]] disputed the grant claiming it was part of his [[Rancho San Rafael]].  Ygnacio Coronel built a small house near where is now [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale College]], and farmed there until outlaws threatened his family. During the [[American-Mexican War]] (1847), Coronel abandoned the rancho, and in 1852 sold Rancho La Ca<U+00F1>ada to the law partners Jonathan R. Scott and Benjamin Hayes.  Scott had come to Southern California from [[Missouri]] in 1849, and became the first American justice of the peace in Los Angeles.  He administered the oath of office to the first Los Angeles City Council on July 3, 1850.  Scott bought out Hayes portion of Rancho La Ca<U+00F1>ada.

A claim for Rancho La Ca<U+00F1>ada was filed with the [[Public Land Commission]] in 1852 and Scott received a US patent in 1866.<ref>[http://www.slc.ca.gov/Misc_Pages/Historical/Surveyors_General/reports/Willey_1884_1886.pdf  Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886]</ref><ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb109nb422&chunk.id=c01-1.3.6.4&brand=oac United States.

In 1857, Scott traded Rancho La Ca<U+00F1>ada to Julio and Catalina Verdugo, heirs of [[Jose Maria Verdugo]], for {{convert|4607|acre|km2|0}} on the west side of Rancho San Rafael - what is today [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].<ref>Yana Ungermann-Marshall, 2006, ''La Canada'', Arcadia Publishing, ISBN 0738531103</ref>  In 1875 Rancho La Ca<U+00F1>ada was sold to two healthseekers from [[Michigan]], Jacob Lanterman, a dentist, and Colonel Adolphus Williams, a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran.<ref>[http://www.lacanadaflintridge.com/comm/history.htm La Ca<U+00F1>ada Flintridge History]</ref>
