'''Vancouver''' ({{pronEng|v<U+00E6>n<U+02C8>ku<U+02D0>v<U+025A>}}) is a coastal city and major seaport located in the [[Lower Mainland]] of southwestern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It is bounded by the [[Strait of Georgia]], the [[Fraser River]], the [[Coast Mountains]], and the city of [[Burnaby]].

Vancouver was first settled in the 1860s as a result of [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] caused by the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]], particularly from the United States, although many immigrants did not remain after the rush. The city developed rapidly from a small [[sawmill|lumber mill]] town into a metropolitan centre following the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railway]] in 1887. The [[Port of Vancouver]] became internationally significant after the completion of the [[Panama Canal]], which reduced freight rates in the 1920s and made it viable to ship export-bound [[Canadian Prairies|prairie grain]] west through Vancouver.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Stevens| first = Leah| title = Rise of the Port of Vancouver, British Columbia| journal = Economic Geography| volume = 12| issue = 1| pages = 61<U+2013>70| publisher = Clark University| date = January 1936| url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-0095%28193601%2912%3A1%3C61%3AROTPOV%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R| doi= 10.2307/140264 |accessdate=2007-01-17| month = Jan| year = 1936}}</ref> It has since become the busiest seaport in Canada, and exports more cargo than any other port in [[North America]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Port Facts| publisher = Port of Vancouver| url = http://www.portvancouver.com/media/port_facts.html| accessdate =2007-01-17}}</ref>

It has diversified over time, however, and Vancouver today has a vibrant [[service industry]], a growing [[Tourism in Canada|tourism]] industry, and it has become the third-largest [[principal photography|film production]] centre in North America after [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]], earning it the nickname [[Hollywood North#Vancouver|Hollywood North]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismvancouver.com/pdf/research/monthly_overnight_visitors_1994_2005.pdf|title=Overnight visitors to Greater Vancouver by volume, monthly and annual basis|publisher=Vancouver Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/default.htm |title=Key Sectors |publisher=Vancouver Economic Development Commission |accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Industry Profile|url=http://www.bcfilmcommission.com/about_us/industry_profile.htm|publisher=BC Film Commission|accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vancouver Film Industry|url=http://www.vancouver.com/movies/hollywood_north/vancouver_film_industry_overview/index.htm|publisher=Vancouver.com|accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Gasher | first = Mike | title = Hollywood North: The Feature Film Industry in British Columbia|publisher = University of British Columbia Press | date = November 2002 | location = Vancouver | id = ISBN 077-4809-67-1}}</ref> Vancouver has had an expansion in high-tech industries, most notably [[video game development]].

The explorer and [[North West Company]] trader [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] and his crew were the first Europeans known to have set foot on the site of the present-day city. In 1808, they traveled from the east, down the [[Fraser River]] perhaps as far as Point Grey, near the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web| title = History of City of Vancouver| publisher = Caroun.com| url = http://www.caroun.com/Countries/America/Canada/Vancouver/2-VancouverHistory.html | accessdate =2007-01-17}}</ref>

The [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] of 1861 brought 25,000 men, mainly from [[California]], to the mouth of the Fraser River and what would become Vancouver.<ref name="Vancouver's past">{{cite book| last = Hull| first = Raymond| title = Vancouver's Past| publisher = University of Washington Press| date = 1974| location = Seattle|coauthors=Soules, Gordon, Soules, Christine| id = ISBN 978-0295953649}}</ref> The first European settlement was established in 1862 at McLeery's Farm on the Fraser River, just east of the ancient village of [[Musqueam]] in what is now [[Marpole]]. A sawmill established at Moodyville (now the [[North Vancouver, British Columbia (city)|City of North Vancouver]]) in 1863 began the city's long relationship with [[logging|lumbering]]. It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp, who had begun lumbering in the [[Port Alberni, British Columbia|Port Alberni]] area, first attempted to run a mill at [[Brockton Point]], but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation to a point near the foot of Gore Street, known as [[Hastings Mill]]. This became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill's central role in the city waned after the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) in the 1880s. It nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s.<ref name="GVB">{{cite book | last = Davis| first = Chuck| title = The Greater Vancouver Book: An Urban Encyclopaedia | publisher = Linkman Press| date = 1997| location = Surrey, British Columbia | pages = 39<U+2013>47| url = http://www.discovervancouver.com/gvb/history-of-vancouver.asp|accessdate =|id = ISBN 978-1896846002}}</ref>

This site, with its natural harbour, was eventually selected as the terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway to the disappointment of [[Port Moody, British Columbia|Port Moody]], [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], all of which had vied to be the railhead. The building of the railway was among the preconditions for British Columbia joining [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1871.

The City of Vancouver was incorporated on [[6 April]] [[1886]], the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived.

During the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]], Vancouver merchants sold a great deal of equipment to prospectors.<ref name="Vancouver's past"/> One of those merchants, Charles Woodward, had opened the first [[Woodward's]] store at what is now Georgia and Main Streets in 1892 and, along with [[Spencer's (department store)|Spencer's]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] department stores, formed the dominant core of the city's retail sector for decades.<ref>{{cite web | title = Our History: Acquisitions, RETAIL, Woodward's Stores Limited| publisher = Hudson's Bay Company| url = http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/woodwards.asp| accessdate =2007-01-23}}</ref>

The economy of early Vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the CPR, which had the capital needed for the rapid development of the new city. Some manufacturing did develop, but the resource sector was the backbone of Vancouver's economy, initially with logging, and later with exports moved through the [[Port of Vancouver|seaport]], where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in Vancouver by the 1930s.<ref>{{cite journal| last = McCandless | first = R.

The dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant [[Trades and Labour Congress of Canada|labour movement]]. The first major sympathy [[strike action|strike]] was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed while picketing at the docks by CPR police during that strike, becoming the British Columbia movement's first martyr.<ref>{{cite book| last = Phillips| first = Paul A.| title = No Power Greater: A Century of Labour in British Columbia| publisher = BC Federation of Labour/Boag Foundation| date = 1967| location = Vancouver| pages = 39<U+2013>41 }}</ref> Canada's first general strike occurred following the death of another labour leader, [[Albert Goodwin|Ginger Goodwin]], in 1918, at the [[Cumberland, British Columbia|Cumberland]] coal mines on [[Vancouver Island]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Phillips| first = Paul A.| title = No Power Greater: A Century of Labour in British Columbia| publisher = BC Federation of Labour/Boag Foundation| date = 1967| location = Vancouver| pages = 71<U+2013>74 }}</ref> A lull in industrial tensions through the later 1920s came to an abrupt end with the [[Great Depression]].

Other social movements, such as the [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]], moral reform, and [[temperance movement]]s were also influential in Vancouver's development.

==Geography and climate==
{{see|Bodies of water in Vancouver|Climate of Vancouver|Lower Mainland Ecoregion}}
The original [[vegetation]] of most of Vancouver and its suburbs was dense [[temperate rain forest]], consisting of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] with scattered pockets of [[maple]] and [[alder]], as well as large areas of [[swamp]]land (even in upland areas, due to poor [[drainage]]).<ref>{{cite web| title= Stanley Park, Vancouver Parks Board, 2006| url=http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/Parks/parks/stanley/|publisher=City of Vancouver |accessdate=2006-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=? |title = The Natural History of Richmond, British Columbia|author = Margaret E A North|publisher = University of British Columbia}}</ref>

[[Image:vanc scenery2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stanley Park]], with the [[Coal Harbour]] residential area in the background]]

The conifers were a typical coastal British Columbia mix of [[Douglas-fir]], [[Thuja plicata|Western red cedar]] and [[Western Hemlock]];<ref>Environment Canada. [http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/Nardesc/Region.cfm?region=196 "Lower Mainland Ecoregion"] Narrative Descriptions of Terrestrial Ecozones and Ecoregions of Canada (#196). Retrieved on: [[August 3]], [[2007]].</ref>  thought to have been the greatest concentration of the largest of these trees on the entire [[British Columbia Coast]]. Only in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]'s [[Elliott Bay]] did the trees rival those of [[Burrard Inlet]] and [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] in size. The largest trees in Vancouver's old-growth forest were in the [[Gastown]] area, where the first [[logging]] occurred, and on the south slopes of [[False Creek]] and English Bay, especially around [[Jericho Beach]]. The forest in [[Stanley Park]] is mostly [[Secondary forest|second]] and third growth, and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there.

A diverse collection of [[plant]]s and [[tree]]s were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and can be found growing throughout Vancouver and the [[Lower Mainland]]. Various species of [[Arecaceae|palm]] trees have proven hardy in this climate and are a common sight, as are large numbers of other exotic trees such as the [[Araucaria araucana|monkey puzzle tree]], the [[Acer palmatum|Japanese Maple]], and various flowering exotics such as [[magnolia]]s, [[azalea]]s, and [[rhododendron]]s. Many rhododendrons have grown to immense sizes, as have other species imported from harsher climates in [[Eastern Canada]] or [[Europe]]. The native [[Acer glabrum|Douglas Maple]] can also attain a tremendous size. Many streets in the city are lined with flowering varieties of [[Sakura|Japanese cherry]] trees that were donated by [[Japan]], starting in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Short History of Our Trees|url=http://www.vancouvercherryblossomfestival.com/vcbf/history|publisher=Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> Certain areas of [[West Vancouver, British Columbia|West Vancouver]] that have the right soil requirements are home to the [[Arbutus menziesii]] tree.

Vancouver has an area of 114&nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (44&nbsp;[[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]), including both flat and hilly ground. Vancouver is adjacent to the [[Strait of Georgia]], a body of water that is shielded from the Pacific Ocean by [[Vancouver Island]]. It is in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] (UTC-8) and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.<ref>{{cite web| title = Pacific Maritime Ecozone| publisher = Environment Canada| url = http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/NarDesc/pacmar_e.cfm Pacific Maritime Ecozone| accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> The city itself forms part of the [[Burrard Peninsula]], lying between [[Burrard Inlet]] to the north and the [[Fraser River]] to the south. Vancouver is not on nearby Vancouver Island. However, both the island and the city (as well as [[Vancouver, Washington]]) are named after Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver.

Vancouver is renowned for its scenery and has one of the largest urban parks in North America, [[Stanley Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World66 - Vancouver Travel Guide|url=http://www.world66.com/northamerica/canada/britishcolumbia/vancouver|publisher=World 66|accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref> The [[North Shore Mountains]] dominate the cityscape, and on a clear day scenic vistas include the snow-capped volcano [[Mount Baker]] in the State of [[Washington]] to the southeast, Vancouver Island across the Strait of Georgia to the west and southwest, and the [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]] to the northwest.<ref name="aboutvancouver">{{cite web | title = About Vancouver| publisher = City of Vancouver| url = http://vancouver.ca/aboutvan.htm#history| accessdate =2007-01-17}}</ref>

Vancouver's climate is unusually temperate by Canadian standards; its winters are the fourth warmest of Canadian cities monitored by [[Environment Canada]] after nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]], and [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]], all of which are on Vancouver Island.<ref>{{cite web| title = Weather Winners &mdash; Mildest Winters| publisher = Environment Canada| url = http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/element.cfm?lang=e | accessdate =2007-01-23}}</ref> Vancouver has daily minimum temperatures falling below 0&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (32&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]) on an average of 46 days per year and below -10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (14&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) on only two days per year. The average annual precipitation is about 1,219&nbsp;millimetres (48&nbsp;[[inch|in]]), though this varies dramatically throughout the city due to the topography.<ref name="aboutvancouver" /> Summer months are quite sunny with moderate temperatures, tempered by sea breezes. The daily maximum averages 22&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (72&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in July and August, although temperatures sometimes rise above 26&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (78&nbsp;<U+00B0>F).<ref>{{cite web|title=British Columbia - Weather and Climate|url=http://www.britishcolumbia.com/information/details.asp?id=16|accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> The summer months are often very dry, resulting in moderate [[drought]] conditions a few months of the year. In contrast, more than half of all winter days receive measurable precipitation. On average, [[snow]] falls on only eleven days per year, with only three days receiving six or more centimetres (2.5&nbsp;in or more).

While the number of cars in Vancouver proper has been steadily rising with population growth, the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by daily commuters have fallen since the early 1990s.<ref name="VanMag" /><ref>{{cite web|title =Traffic entering Vancouver, 1986 to 2005| publisher = City of Vancouver| url = http://www.vancouver.ca/commsvcs/cityplans/transportation/traffic.htm| accessdate =2007-05-30}}</ref> Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with these trends.

This is, in part, the result of a push by city planners for a solution to traffic problems and pro-environment campaigns. [[Transportation Demand Management|Transportation demand management]] policies have imposed restrictions on drivers making it more difficult and expensive to commute while introducing more benefits for non-drivers.<ref name="VanMag" />

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Vancouver}}
[[Image:Stadtgliederung Vancouver 2008.png|thumb|right|Neighbourhoods of Vancouver]]

[[Urban planning|City planners]] in the late 1950s and 1960s deliberately encouraged the development of high-rise residential towers in Vancouver's [[West End, Vancouver|West End]] of downtown, resulting in a compact urban core amenable to public transit, cycling, and pedestrian traffic. Vancouver's population density on the downtown peninsula is 121 people per [[hectare]] (or 49 people per [[acre]]), according to the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 census]].<ref>{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/commsvcs/cityplans/CityFacts04.pdf | title = City facts 2004 | format = PDF | publisher = City of Vancouver | accessdate =}}</ref> The city continues to pursue policies intended to increase density as an alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]], such as Mayor [[Sam Sullivan]]'s EcoDensity &mdash; an initiative to create quality and high density areas in the city, while making property ownership more economical. The plan also calls for the increased construction of community centres, parks, and cultural facilities.<ref>{{cite web| title=Vancouver EcoDensity Initiative|url=http://www.mayorsamsullivan.ca/ecodensity/| publisher = Sam Sullivan|accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref>

Vancouver has been called a "city of neighbourhoods", each with a distinct character and ethnic mix.<ref>{{cite paper| author = Thomas R.

The [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] are by far the largest visible ethnic group in the city, and Vancouver has one of the most diverse [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-speaking communities, with several Chinese dialects being represented, including Cantonese and Mandarin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visible minorities (2001 census)|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo53e.htm|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2006-10-19}}</ref><ref name="GVB"/> There are also some neighbourhoods with high concentrations of single ethnic groups, such as the [[Punjabi Market, Vancouver|Punjabi Market]], [[Little Italy, Vancouver|Little Italy]], [[Greektown, Vancouver|Greektown]], and [[Japantown, Vancouver|Japantown]]. Bilingual street signs can be seen in various neighbourhoods, including Chinatown and the Punjabi Market.

In the 1980s, an influx of immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] in anticipation of the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of that former colony's sovereignty]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] combined with an increasing number of immigrants from mainland China and previous immigrants from [[Taiwan]] to create one of the largest concentrations of ethnic Chinese residents in North America.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

This influx of Asian immigrants continued a tradition of immigration from around the world that had already established Vancouver as the second most popular destination for immigrants in Canada (after [[Toronto]]).<ref>{{cite web| title = Canada's ethnocultural portrait: Canada| publisher = Statistics Canada| date =2001| url = http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/etoimm/canada.cfm | accessdate =2007-01-28}}
</ref> Other significant [[Asian Canadian|Asian]] ethnic groups in Vancouver are [[South Asia]]n (mostly [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]], usually referred to as [[Indo-Canadian]]), [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Filipino people|Filipino]], [[Indonesian people|Indonesian]], [[Korean people|Korean]], [[Cambodian people|Cambodian]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]. It has a growing Latin American population, many from [[Peruvian people|Peru]], [[Ecuador]] and more recently, [[Mexican people|Mexico]]. 

Prior to the Hong Kong influx of the 1990s, the largest non-British ethnic groups in the city were [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] and [[German Canadian|German]], followed by [[Scandinavia]]n, [[Italian Canadian|Italian]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukranian]] and the historical [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] population. Less numerous minorities, such as newly-arrived [[Eastern Europe]]ans (in addition to the aforementioned Ukrainians), are also a feature of the city's ethnic landscape.

There is also a sizable [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] community in Vancouver as well as in the surrounding metropolitan region, with the result that Vancouver constitutes the largest native community in the province.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community Highlights for VancouverStatistics Canada (2001 census)|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/Profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915022&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=|date= (2001 census data)|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref>

With its location on the [[Pacific Rim]] and at the western terminus of Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway|transcontinental highway]] and rail routes, Vancouver is one of the nation's largest industrial centres.<ref name="aboutvancouver"/>

The [[Port of Vancouver]], Canada's largest and most diversified, does more than [[Canadian dollar|C$]]43 billion in trade with over 90 countries annually. Port activities generate $4 billion in [[gross domestic product]] and $8.9 billion in economic output.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portvancouver.com/media/port_facts.html|title=Port Facts|publisher=Vancouver Port Authority|accessdate=2007-01-15 }}</ref>
Vancouver is also the headquarters of [[forestry|forest product]] and [[mining]] companies. In recent years, Vancouver has become an increasingly important centre for [[software development]], [[biotechnology]] and a vibrant [[Cinema of Canada|film industry]].

The city's scenic location makes it a major tourist destination. Visitors come for the city's gardens, [[Stanley Park]], [[Queen Elizabeth Park]], and the mountains, ocean, forest and parklands surrounding the city. The numerous beaches, parks, waterfronts, and mountain backdrop, combined with its cultural and multi-ethnic character, all contribute to its unique appeal and style for tourists. Over a million people annually pass through Vancouver en route to a [[cruise ship]] vacation, usually to [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Why visit Vancouver?|publisher=Tourism Vancouver|url=http://www.tourismvancouver.com/visitors/about_vancouver/why_vancouver|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>

The city's popularity comes with a price. Vancouver can be an expensive city, with the highest housing prices in Canada.

A major and ongoing downtown [[condominium]] construction boom began in the late 1990s, financed in large part by a huge flow of capital from [[Hong Kong]] immigrants prior to the 1997 hand-over to China.<ref>{{cite web| title = For Many From Hong Kong, Vancouver Is a Way Station| publisher = New York Times Hong Kong| date = 14 February 1997| url = http://www.nytimes.com/specials/hongkong/archive/0214hongkong-vancouver.html|format=[[html]]|accessdate =2007-04-17}}</ref> High-rise residential developments from this period now dominate the [[Yaletown]] and [[Coal Harbour]] districts of the downtown peninsula, and also cluster around some of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] stations on the east side of the city.

The city has been selected to co-host the 2010 Winter Olympics, which is influencing economic development. Concern has been expressed that Vancouver's increasing [[homelessness]] problem may be exacerbated by the Olympics because owners of single room occupancy hotels, which house many of the city's lowest income residents, have begun converting their properties in order to attract higher income residents and tourists.<ref>{{cite news | title = Homelessness could triple by 2010: Report | publisher = CBC| date = 21 September 2006 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2006/09/21/bc-pivot-housing.html | accessdate =}}</ref> Another significant international event, the [[1986 World Exposition]], was held in Vancouver. It was the last [[World's Fair]] held in North America and was considered a success, receiving 20,111,578 visits. Several Vancouver landmarks date from that period, including the SkyTrain public transit system, the [[Plaza of Nations]], and [[Canada Place]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Expo '86 | work = The Canadian Encyclopedia| publisher = Historica| url = http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&ArticleId=A0002692| accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

==Government==
{{main|Government and politics of Vancouver}}

Vancouver, unlike other British Columbia municipalities, is incorporated under a unique provincial statute, the ''Vancouver Charter''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/V/vanch_00.htm|title=Vancouver Charter|publisher=Queen's Printer (British Columbia)|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> The legislation, passed in 1953, supersedes the ''Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921'' and grants the city more and different powers than other communities possess under BC's ''Municipalities Act''.

The civic government has been dominated by the [[centre-right]] [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA) since the [[World War II|Second World War]], albeit with some significant [[centre-left]] interludes.<ref name="GVB" /> The NPA's [[Sam Sullivan]] was elected mayor of Vancouver in November 2005, signaling the party's return to power after a [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|social democratic]] slate swept the previous election. The NPA fractured over the issue of [[narcotic|drug]] policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] on a [[harm reduction]] platform. Subsequently, North America's [[Insite|first safe injection site]] was opened for the significant number of intravenous [[heroin]] users in the city.

Vancouver is governed by the ten-member [[Vancouver City Council]], a nine-member School Board, and a seven-member Parks Board, all elected for three-year terms through an [[At-Large|at-large]] system. Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along [[Conservatism in Canada|conservative]] or [[Liberalism in Canada|liberal]] lines while the eastern side of the city has voted along [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] lines.<ref>{{cite paper|author = Andrea Barbara Smith| title = The Origins of the NPA: A Study in Vancouver Politics| version = MA thesis| publisher = University of British Columbia| date = 1981}}</ref> This was reaffirmed with the results of the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005 provincial election]] and the [[Canadian federal election results in Vancouver and the Northern Lower Mainland|2006 federal election]].
[[Image:Van City Hall 2010 Flag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vancouver City Hall]] with the 2010 Winter Olympics Flag]]

Though polarized, a political consensus has emerged in Vancouver around a number of issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of [[rapid transit]] as opposed to a freeway system, a harm reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the [[political spectrum]] in Vancouver.

[[Larry Campbell]]'s election as mayor in 2002 was in part due to his willingness to champion alternative interventions for drug issues, such as supervised injection sites. The city has adopted a ''Four Pillars Drug Strategy'', which combines harm reduction (e.g. needle exchanges, supervised injection sites) with treatment, enforcement, and prevention.<ref>{{cite web| title = Four Pillars Drug Strategy| publisher = City of Vancouver| date = 2001| url = http://www.vancouver.ca/fourpillars/| accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> The strategy is largely a response to the endemic [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis C]] among injection drug users in the city's [[Downtown Eastside]] neighbourhood. The area is characterized by entrenched poverty, and consequently is home to the "low track" street sex trade and a bustling "open air" street drug market, which gave rise to a significant [[AIDS]] epidemic in the 1990s. Some community and professional groups &mdash; such as From Grief to Action and Keeping the Door Open &mdash; are fostering public dialogue in the city about further alternatives to current drug policies.<ref>{{cite web|title=From Grief to Action|url=http://www.fromgrieftoaction.org|publisher=From Grief to Action|accessdate=2006-11-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Maxwell|first=Gillian|title=Keeping the Door Open|url=http://www.keepingthedooropen.com|publisher=AIDS Vancouver|accessdate=2006-11-15}}</ref>

Campbell chose not to run for re-election, and was subsequently appointed to the [[Senate of Canada]]. In the [[Vancouver municipal election, 2005|2005 Municipal Election]], the City Council swung back to the right after a term dominated by the leftist [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE). NPA mayoral candidate [[Sam Sullivan]] narrowly defeated [[Jim Green]] for the position of mayor and was joined by five of his party's members on Council. The centrist [[Vision Vancouver]] (VVN) brought four members to Council, with the final seat going to COPE. The NPA also won six of nine School Board seats and five of seven Parks Board seats, while the remaining Board seats were won by COPE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/ctyclerk/election2005/finalresults.htm|title=Vancouver Votes November 19, 2005 |publisher=City of Vancouver |accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> 

===Provincial representation===
In the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]], Vancouver is represented by ten [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs), which includes [[Gordon Campbell]], the current [[Premier]]. In the 2005 provincial election, the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|BC New Democratic Party]] each won five seats.

===Federal representation===
In the [[Canadian House of Commons]], Vancouver is represented by five [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal elections]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] won four seats and the federal [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) one. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal elections]], all the same Members of Parliament were re-elected. However, on [[6 February]] [[2006]], [[David Emerson]] of [[Vancouver Kingsway]] defected to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], giving the Conservatives one seat in Vancouver. As of February 2006, the Liberals hold three seats, and the NDP and the Conservatives hold one each.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Vancouver}}
{{seealso | List of Vancouver roads}}
Vancouver's [[tram|streetcar]] system began on [[28 June]] [[1890]] and ran from the (first) [[Granville Street Bridge]] to Westminster Avenue (now [[Main Street (Vancouver)|Main Street]]). Less than a year later, the Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company began operating Canada's first interurban line between the two cities, which encouraged residential neighbourhoods outside the central core to develop.<ref>{{cite web | last = Davis| first = Chuck| url = http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology2.html| title = The History of Metropolitan Vancouver| accessdate =2006-11-23}}</ref> The [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] became the company that operated the urban and interurban rail system, until 1958 when its last vestiges were dismantled in favour of "trackless" trolley and gasoline/diesel  [[bus]]es.<ref>{{cite web | last = Davis| first = Chuck| url = http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology1958.htm| title = The History of Metropolitan Vancouver| accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> Vancouver currently has the second largest trolley bus fleet in North America after San Francisco.

City councils, as part of a long term plan, prohibited the construction of [[freeway]]s in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Millar|first=Royce|title=No freeways puts Vancouver on top|date=2006-09-11|work=The Age|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/09/10/1157826813807.html|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> The only major freeway within city limits is [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]], which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city.

[[Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority|South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority]] ([[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]]), the [[Metro Vancouver]] transportation authority, is responsible for roads and public transportation within the region. It provides a bus service, [[B-Line (Vancouver)|B-Line]] Rapid Bus Service (two of the three B-Lines run in Vancouver with two more B-Lines by 2008), a foot passenger and bicycle ferry service (known as [[SeaBus]]), a two-line automated light rail service called [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], and [[West Coast Express]] commuter rail.<ref>{{cite web| year = December 2005 | url =http://www.translink.bc.ca/files/pdf/plan_proj/2006_Transportation_Plan.pdf| title = 2006 Transportation Plan | format = PDF| publisher = TransLink | accessdate =2006-11-23}}</ref>

Changes are being made to the regional transportation network as part of the [[Gateway Program]]. Current projects include the [[Canada Line]], a rapid-transit line that will connect [[Vancouver International Airport]] and the neighbouring city of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] with the existing Skytrain system.  There is also planning going forward to extend the SkyTrain Millennium Line west to UBC as a subway under Broadway and capacity upgrades and an extension to the Expo Line. Many other road projects will be completed within the next few years, including the [[Golden Ears Bridge]].
[[Image:SkyTrain MkII near Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Vancouver's SkyTrain.]]

Inter-city passenger rail service is operated from [[Pacific Central Station (Vancouver)|Pacific Central Station]] by [[VIA Rail]] to points east; [[Amtrak Cascades]] to [[Seattle, Washington]]; and [[Rocky Mountaineer]] rail tour routes.

Small passenger ferries operating in False Creek provide commuter service to Granville Island, Downtown Vancouver and Kitsilano.

Vancouver is served by [[Vancouver International Airport]] (YVR), located on [[Sea Island, British Columbia|Sea Island]] in the City of Richmond, immediately south of Vancouver. Vancouver's airport is Canada's second busiest airport, and the second largest gateway on the west coast of North America for international passengers. [[HeliJet]] and three [[float plane]] companies [[Salt Spring Air]], [[Harbour Air]] and [[West Coast Air]] operate scheduled air service from Vancouver harbour and YVR south terminal. The city is also served by two [[BC Ferries|BC Ferry]] terminals. One is to the northwest at [[Horseshoe Bay, British Columbia|Horseshoe Bay]], [[West Vancouver, British Columbia|West Vancouver]], and the other is to the south, at [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]] (in [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]]).

==Education==
===Schools===
Vancouver is served by [[School District 39 Vancouver]], the second largest [[school district]] in British Columbia.<ref>{{cite web | year = June 2005 | url = http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/review/039_2005.pdf| title = District Review Report, School District No. 39 Vancouver | format = PDF| publisher = British Columbia Education| accessdate =2006-11-23}}</ref> As in other parts of the province, numerous [[independent school]]s are also eligible for partial provincial funding &mdash; this includes [[parochial school|religious school]]s, [[secularism|non-denominational]] schools, and [[special education|special-needs]] schools, most of which also charge [[tuition]]. Vancouver also includes three schools that are part of the province-wide [[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]] (CSF), the [[Francophone]] public school district.

===Universities and colleges===
The two major public universities in the Lower Mainland, the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) and [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU), have satellite [[campus]]es within the city, as does the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]], which provides [[polytechnic]] education and grants [[academic degree|degrees]] in several fields. [[Vancouver Community College]] and [[Langara College]], along with other colleges in surrounding communities, provide career, trade, and university-transfer programs for Vancouver residents. [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]] grants certificates, diplomas, and degrees in art and design. Other arts schools include the [[Vancouver Film School]] and [[Studio 58]], a program of Langara.

===International students===
Foreign students, particularly from the Pacific Rim, have grown in importance for Vancouver's public and private post-secondary educational facilities. International undergraduate enrolment at UBC has grown to nine per cent, or 2,800 students, from two per cent since 1996. Some private schools have been closed or sanctioned for improperly advertising to international students.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=96c3ab06-aa5b-4f8b-a40e-74039a3b4155 New Jersey university to open campus here], By Janet Steffenhagen, ''Vancouver Sun'', B1, Published June 19, 2007</ref>

==Architecture and cityscape==
[[Image:Vancouver clock tower.jpg|thumb|left|222px|Clock tower of the Vancouver Block on Granville Street, constructed by Dominic Burns of the [[Patrick Burns (businessman)|Burns]] Meat family]]
Notable buildings within the city include [[Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver)|Christ Church Cathedral]], the [[Hotel Vancouver]], and the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]]. There are several striking [[modern architecture|modern]] buildings in the downtown area, including the [[Harbour Centre]], Vancouver Law Courts and surrounding plaza known as [[Robson Square]] (Arthur Erickson) and the [[Vancouver Library Square]] ([[Moshe Safdie]], architect), reminiscent of the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]]. 

The original [[BC Hydro]] headquarters building at Nelson and Burrard Streets is a [[modernism|modernist]] high-rise, now converted into the Electra condominiums. Also notable is the "concrete waffle" of the MacMillan-Bloedel building on the north-east corner of the Georgia and Thurlow intersection. A prominent addition to the city's landscape is the giant tent-frame [[Canada Place]], the former Canada Pavilion from [[Expo '86]], which includes the [[Vancouver Convention & Exhibition Centre|Trade and Convention Centre]] as well as a Cruise Ship Terminal and the Pan-Pacific Hotel. Two modern skyscrapers that define the skyline looking south are the city hall and the Centennial Pavilion of Vancouver Hospital, both by Townley and Matheson (1936 and 1958 respectively).<ref>{{cite book| last = Davis| first = Chuck| coauthors = Harold Kalman| title = Greater Vancouver Book: An Urban Encyclopaedia| publisher = Linkman Press | date = 1997| location = Surrey, BC| pages = 185<U+2013>196| url = http://www.discovervancouver.com/GVB/notable-buildings.asp|id = ISBN 978-1896846002}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Kalman| first = Harold| title = Exploring Vancouver: Ten Tours of the City and its Buildings| publisher = University of British Columbia Press| date = 1974| location = Vancouver| pages = 160<U+2013>161| id = ISBN 0774800283}}</ref>

A collection of [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] buildings in the city's old downtown core were, in their day, the tallest buildings in the [[British Empire]]. These were, in succession, the Province Building, the [[Dominion Building]] (1907, both at Cambie and Hastings Streets), and the [[Sun Tower]] (1911) at Beatty and Pender Streets. The Sun Tower's [[cupola]] was finally exceeded as the Empire's tallest by the elaborate [[Art Deco]] [[Marine Building]] in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book| last = Kalman| first = Harold| title = Exploring Vancouver: Ten Tours of the City and its Buildings| publisher = University of British Columbia Press| date = 1974| location = Vancouver| pages = 22,24,78| id = ISBN 0774800283}}</ref> Inspired by [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Chrysler Building]], the Marine Building is known for its elaborate [[ceramic]] tile facings and brass-gilt doors and elevators, which make it a favourite location for movie shoots.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://canada.archiseek.com/british_columbia/vancouver/marine_building.html| title = Marine Building| publisher = Archiseek | accessdate =2006-11-23}}</ref> 

Another notable Edwardian building in the city is the Vancouver Art Gallery building, designed by Francis Mawson Rattenbury, who also designed the provincial Legislature and the original and highly decorative Hotel Vancouver (torn down after WWII as a condition of the completion of the new Hotel Vancouver a block away This is all owned by Jon Smith).<ref>{{cite web | last = Davis| first = Chuck| url = http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/archives_rattenbury.htm | title = The History of Metropolitan Vancouver| work = Rattenbury| publisher = Vancouver History | accessdate =2006-11-23}}</ref>

The most striking aspect of Vancouver's cityscape is its density.  Through active planning, Vancouver has become somewhat unique among North American cities, and is continually ranked highly in livability.  Consequently, the city's success initiated an urban planning movement known as [[Vancouverism]], characterized by high-rise residential and mixed-use development in urban centres.<ref>{{cite web | title = Vancouverism| publisher = Canadian Architect| url = http://www.canadianarchitect.com/Issues/ISarticle.asp?id=177934&story_id=164583120907&issue=08012006&PC= Vancouverism: Definitions| accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref>  

One principle of Vancouverism involves protecting "View Corridors".  Vancouver's "View Protection Guidelines" were approved in 1989 and amended in 1990, establishing view corridors in the downtown with height limits to protect views of the [[North Shore Mountains]]. These guidelines have succeeded in preserving mountain views, although some find Vancouver's skyline flat and lacking in visual interest and failing to represent the city's contemporary image. In response, [[Vancouver City Council|Council]] commissioned a "Skyline Study" in 1997 which concluded that Vancouver's skyline would benefit from the addition of a handful of buildings exceeding current height limits, to add visual interest to Vancouver's skyline.<ref>{{cite web| title = Downtown Vancouver Skyline Study| work = Special Council Meeting Minutes | publisher = City of Vancouver| date = 7 and 23 April 1997| url=http://www.vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/970407/skyline.htm | format = [[PDF]]| accessdate =}}</ref>

In 1986, Greater Vancouver's cultural community created the Alliance for Arts and Culture to provide a strong voice for the sector and an avenue to work together. This coalition now numbers more than 320 arts groups and individuals. The Alliance's mission is to "strive towards an environment that recognizes, respects, and responds to the contribution our sector makes to society's well-being."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allianceforarts.com/about-us/mission-and-priorities.html| title=Mission and Priorities| publisher=Alliance for Arts and Culture|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref>

The city produced a number of notable [[punk rock]] bands, the most famous example being pioneering [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] band [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], whose enduring prominence in the city was such that Mayor [[Larry Campbell]] declared [[December 21]], [[2003]] "D.O.A. Day" in honour of the band's 25th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.straight.com/article-69929/d-o-a-s-punk-veterans-won-t-give-up-the-fight|title= D.O.A.<U+2019>s punk veterans won<U+2019>t give up the fight|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=The Georgia Straight|author=John Lucas}}</ref> Other notable early punk bands from Vancouver included the [[Subhumans (Canadian band)|Subhumans]], the [[Young Canadians]], the [[Pointed Sticks]], Active Dog, The Modernettes, [[UJ3RK5]], I, Braineater, and [[Nomeansno]] (originally from [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]).

[[Image:Nightlife-in-Vancouver.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Vancouver Nightlife - Nelson and Granville St.]]
Vancouver's large Chinese population has a significant music scene, which has produced several [[Cantopop]] stars. Similarly, various Indo-Canadian artists and actors have a profile in [[Bollywood]] or other aspects of [[India]]'s entertainment industry.

Nightlife in Vancouver had, for years, been seen as restricted in comparison to other cities, with early closing times for bars and night clubs, and a reluctance by authorities to allow for further development. However, since 2003 Vancouver has experimented with later closing hours and relaxed regulations, and an effort has been made to develop the Downtown core even further as an [[Granville Entertainment District|entertainment district]], especially on and around [[Granville Street]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Police take aim at Vancouver's entertainment district| publisher = CBC | date = 7 November 2006| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/11/07/bc-police-bars.html | accessdate =2007-01-23}}</ref>

==Sports and recreation==
{{Main|Sports in Vancouver}}

The mild climate of the city and close proximity to ocean, mountains, rivers and lakes make the area a popular destination for outdoor recreation. Indeed, Vancouver has a low adult [[obesity]] rate of 12% compared to the Canadian average, 23%; however, while 51% of Vancouverites are considered overweight, it is the fourth thinnest city in Canada after Toronto, [[Montreal]], and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Regional differences in obesity| work = Health Reports| publisher = Statistics Canada| date = 22 August 2006| url =http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060822/d060822b.htm | accessdate =2007-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Sharon|last=Kirkey|title=Suburban Sprawl|publisher=CanWest News Service|date=[[2006-08-23]]|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/bodyandhealth/story.html?id=eee5654b-03e0-4dc3-8e3c-c116ee68a15c&k=82271&p=2|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref>

Vancouver has over 1,298 hectares (3,200&nbsp;acres) of parks, with Stanley Park being the largest at 404 hectares (1,000&nbsp;acres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/parks/info/aboutus/index.htm|title=About the Park Board|publisher=Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation|accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref> The municipality also has several large beaches, many adjacent to one another, with the largest groups extending from the coast of Stanley Park before reaching False Creek, and on the other side of English Bay, starting in the Kitsilano neighbourhood all the way to the [[University Endowment Lands]], which are separate from Vancouver. The 18 kilometres (11&nbsp;miles) of beaches that surround Vancouver include English Bay (First Beach), Jericho, [[Kitsilano Beach]], Locarno, Second Beach (Stanley Park), [[Spanish Bank]] East, Spanish Bank Extension, Spanish Bank West, Sunset, and Third Beach (Stanley Park).<ref>{{cite news | last = Thomas| first = Sandra| title = City gets into the swim of things| publisher = Vancouver Courier| date = 19 May 2006| url = http://www.vancourier.com/issues06/053206/news/053206nn8.html| accessdate =2007-01-15}}</ref> The coastline provides for many types of water sport, and the city is a popular destination for boating enthusiasts.

The nearby [[North Shore Mountains]] are home to three ski areas, [[Cypress Mountain]], [[Grouse Mountain]], and [[Mount Seymour]]. Each are within 20 to 30 minutes (driving time) of downtown Vancouver. [[Mountain biking|Mountain bikers]] have created world-renowned trails across the North Shore. The [[Capilano River]], Lynn Creek, Seymour River, within 20 minutes (driving time) of downtown, provide opportunities to [[whitewater]] enthusiasts during periods of rain and spring melt. 

Running races include the [[Vancouver Sun Run]] (a 10&nbsp;km race) every April; the [[Vancouver Marathon]] is held every May and Scotiabank Vancouver Half-Marathon held every June.

Vancouver will be the host city for the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympic]] and [[2010 Winter Paralympics|Paralympic]] Games and the 2009 [[World Police and Fire Games]]. [[Swangard Stadium]], in nearby [[Burnaby, British Columbia|Burnaby]], hosted some games for the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].  

Vancouver is exploring a joint bid for Vancouver and [[Seattle]] to host the [[2028 Summer Olympics]]. A multi-national bid would be a first for the Olympics as an [[International Olympic Committee]] rule currently requires that the [[Olympics]] be awarded to a single city. Vancouver and [[Seattle]] both believe that the logistics can be overcome and have cited that the travel time between [[Seattle]] and Vancouver is similar to the travel time between [[Whistler, British Columbia]] and Vancouver.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Vancouver is home to the Vancouver Ultimate League[http://www.vul.bc.ca/v3/], an [[Ultimate Frisbee]] league. In Summer 2008 Vancouver will host the World Ultimate Championships<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wugc2008.com |title= WFDF 2008 World Ultimate & Guts Championships |accessdate= 2008-08-02 |author= |date= |format= |publisher= |quote= }}</ref>
