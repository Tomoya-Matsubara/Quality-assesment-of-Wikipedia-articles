'''John Sidney McCain III''' (born August 29, 1936) is the [[senior senator|senior]] [[United States]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Arizona]] and <!-- please see editor comment above! --> [[Presumptive nominee|presumptive]] <!-- please see editor comment above! --> [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]].

McCain graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1958 and became a [[naval aviator]], flying [[ground-attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he nearly lost his life in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|1967 USS ''Forrestal'' fire]]. Later that year while on a bombing mission over [[North Vietnam]], he was shot down, badly injured, and captured as a [[prisoner of war]] by the North Vietnamese. He was held from 1967 to 1973, experiencing episodes of [[torture]] and refusing an out-of-sequence early [[repatriation]] offer; his war wounds would leave him with lifelong physical limitations.

He retired from the Navy as a [[Captain (United States)#United States Navy, Coast Guard, and uniformed services|captain]] in 1981 and, moving to Arizona, entered politics. Elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1982, he served two terms, and was then elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1986, winning re-election easily in 1992, 1998, and 2004. While generally adhering to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] principles, McCain has gained a media reputation as a "maverick" for disagreeing with his party on several key issues. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the "[[Keating Five]]", he made [[campaign finance reform]] one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passage of the [[McCain-Feingold Act]] in 2002. He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s, and for his belief that the [[war in Iraq]] should be fought to a successful conclusion in the 2000s. McCain has chaired the powerful [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce Committee]], and has been a leader in seeking to rein in both [[pork barrel]] spending as well as [[Gang of 14|Senate filibusters]] of judicial nominations.

McCain lost the Republican nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] to [[George W. Bush]]. He ran again for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, and gained enough [[delegate]]s to become the party's presumptive nominee in March 2008.
