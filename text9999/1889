'''Ren<U+00E9> Gary Wayne Bourque''' (born December 10, 1981) is a professional [[ice hockey]] [[winger (ice hockey)|left winger]] who currently plays for the [[Calgary Flames]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  An undrafted player, Bourque was signed by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] as a free agent in 2004 after spending four years at the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]].  He began his professional career with the [[Norfolk Admirals]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) where he won the [[Dudley "Red" Garrett Memorial Award]] as the league's rookie of the year in [[2004<U+2013>05 AHL season|2004<U+2013>05]].  He joined the Blackhawks for the [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season]] and spent three years in Chicago before a 2008 trade sent him to Calgary.

Bourque established himself as a top offensive player for the Flames, leading the team to sign him to a contract that will have him remain in Calgary until 2016. He gianed his first international experience as a member of the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team]] at the [[2010 IIHF World Championship]].  Of [[M<U+00E9>tis]] heritage, Bourque has initiated several charitable causes dedicated to encouraging aboriginal children and helping youth from rural Northern Alberta afford the cost of playing hockey.

==Early life==

The family settled in Lac La Biche when Bourque was seven.
