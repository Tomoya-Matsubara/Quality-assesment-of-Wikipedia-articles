'''Street''' is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the county of [[Somerset]], England, situated on a dry spot in the [[Somerset Levels]], at the end of the [[Polden Hills]], two miles south-west of [[Glastonbury]]. The village has a [[population]] of 11,066.<ref name="popn"/> Its name comes from a 12th century causeway from [[Glastonbury]] which was built to transport local [[Blue Lias]] stone from what is now Street to rebuild [[Glastonbury Abbey]], although it had previously been known as '''Lantokay''' and Lega.

There is evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the history of the village is dominated by the Abbey until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. The [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]] had become established there by the mid 17th century. One Quaker family, the Clarks, started a business in sheepskin rugs, woollen [[slipper]]s and, later, [[boot]]s and [[shoe]]s. This became [[C&J Clark]] which still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form [[Clarks Village]], the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. [[The Shoe Museum]] provides information about the history of Clarks and footwear manufacture in general. The Clark family mansion and its estate at the edge of the village are now owned by [[Millfield School]], an [[independent school (UK)|independent]] co-educational boarding. Street is also home to [[Crispin School]] and [[Strode College]].

To the north of the town, the [[River Brue]] marks the boundary with Glastonbury. South of Street are the [[Walton and Ivythorn Hills]] and [[East Polden Grasslands]] [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest|biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest]]. Street has two public swimming pools, one indoor which is part of the Strode complex, and the outdoor [[lido]], Greenbank. [[Strode Theatre]] provides a venue for films, exhibitions and live performances. The Anglican Parish [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Street|Church of The Holy Trinity]] dates from the 14th century and has been designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade I [[listed building]].

== History ==
The settlement's earliest known name is Lantokay, meaning the sacred enclosure of [[Saint Kea|Kea]], a [[Celt]]ic [[saint]].<ref name="gathercole">{{cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_StreetText.pdf |title=Street|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> In the [[Domesday Book]] it was recorded as Strate,<ref name="National Archives">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday|title=Domesday Book at the National Archives|accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref> and also Lega, a name still used throughout the country in the modern form, "Leigh".<ref name="churchyard">{{cite web|url=http://www.streetandwalton.co.uk/church/hollinrake.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070814013924/http://www.streetandwalton.co.uk/church/hollinrake.php|archivedate=2007-08-14|title=The archaeology of Street Churchyard|publisher=Holy Trinity Street and Walton|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> The centre of Street is where Lower Leigh hamlet was, and the road called Middle Leigh and the community called Overleigh are to the south of the village. In the 12th century, a causeway from [[Glastonbury]] was built to transport stone from what is now Street for rebuilding [[Glastonbury Abbey]] after a fire,<ref name="gathercole"/> and Street's name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''strata'' - a paved road. The causeway is about {{convert|100|yd|m|-1}} north of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] road.

Quarries of the local [[blue lias]] stone were worked from as early as the 12th century to the end of the 19th century. It is a [[formation (stratigraphy)|geological formation]] in southern England, part of the [[Lias Group]]. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of [[limestone]] and [[shale]] layers, laid down in latest [[Triassic]] and early [[Jurassic]] times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. Its age corresponds to the [[Rhaetian]] to lower [[Sinemurian]] stages of the [[geologic timescale]], thus fully including the [[Hettangian]] stage. It is the lowest of the three divisions of the [[Lower Jurassic]] period and, as such, is also given the name ''[[Lower Lias]]''.<ref>{{aut|Ambrose, K.}}; '''2001''': [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/geol/pga/2001/00000112/00000002/art00001;jsessionid=iyhnp71msoi2.alexandra ''The lithostratigraphy of the Blue Lias Formation (Late Rhaetian<U+2013>Early Sinemurian) in the southern part of the English Midlands''], Proceedings of the Geologists' Association '''112(2)''', pp. 97-110.</ref> It consists of thin blue argillaceous, or clay-like, limestone.

The churchyard of the Parish Church has yielded one iron age coin, however the origin and significance is unclear,<ref name="gathercole"/> although the [[Dobunni]] were known to have produced coins in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iron Age Coins|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/share/research/projectreports/romancoins/ironage/index.html|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref>  A number of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] pottery fragments, now in the [[Somerset County Museum]]. Remains of [[Roman villa]]s exist on the south edge of Street near Marshalls Elm and Ivythorn. Buried remains of a Roman road were excavated in the early 20th century on the flood-plain of the river Brue between Glastonbury and Street.<ref name="gathercole"/> The parish churchyard is on the first flood-free ground near the river Brue and was probably the first land to be inhabited. The form of the large churchyard suggests a ''[[Llan (placename element)|lan]]'', a sacred area of a kind that was built in the first half of the 6th century.<ref name="churchyard"/> Llan or Lan is a common place name element in [[Brythonic languages]] such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], and possibly [[Pictish language|Pictish]]. The original meaning of ''llan'' in Welsh is "an enclosed piece of land", but it later evolved to mean the parish surrounding a church.<ref>{{cite web|title=Llan|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/elements/pages/llan.shtml|work=Place names|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref>

One biography of [[St Gildas]] has the saint spending some time in Glastonbury Abbey, and moving to a site by the river, where he built a chapel to the Holy Trinity and there died. The Parish Church, now Holy Trinity, has at times been known as St Gildas' church.<ref name="churchyard"/> Glastonbury Abbey controlled Street until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]].

[[Sharpham|Sharpham Park]] is a {{convert|300|acre|km2|sing=on}} historic park, approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} west of Street, which dates back to the [[Bronze Age]]. The first known reference is a grant by [[Edwy of England|King Edwy]] to the then [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Wessex|Aethelwold]] in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was conferred by the soon-to-be [[John of England|King John I]] to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the [[Duke of Somerset]], Sir [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], brother of [[Jane Seymour|Queen Jane]]; the [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath|Thynne]] family of [[Longleat]], and the family of Sir [[Henry Gould]]. [[Edward Dyer]] was born here in 1543. The house is now a private residence and Grade II* [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Abbots Sharpham and Sharpham Park Farmhouse | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=267774 | accessdate=25 November 2006}}</ref> It was the birthplace of Sir [[Edward Dyer]] (died 1607) an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] poet and courtier, the writer [[Henry Fielding]] (1707&ndash;54), and the cleric [[William Gould]].

Ivythorn Manor on Pages Hill was a medieval monastic house. It was rebuilt in 1488 for Abbot John Selwood of Glastonbury Abbey. After the dissolution of the monasteries it became a manor house owned by the Marshall and Sydenham families. Sir John Sydenham added a wing 1578 which was later demolished. By 1834 the house was largely ruined until its restoration around 1904, and a west wing was added in 1938. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ivythorn Manor|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=267794|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

==Governance==
The [[Parish councils in England|parish council]] is responsible for some local issues, and sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover its council<U+2019>s operating costs. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and [[Neighbourhood Watch (UK)|neighbourhood watch]] groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council also initiates projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, and consults with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. Having previously been part of Street Urban District, the village now falls within the [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Mendip]], which was formed on 1 April 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10074344&c_id=10001043|title=Street Urban District|work=A Vision of Britain Through Time|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> and is responsible for [[planning permission|local planning]] and [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|building control]], local roads, [[council housing]], [[environmental health]], [[market]]s and fairs, [[refuse collection]] and [[recycling]], [[cemeteries]] and [[crematoria]], leisure services, parks, and [[tourism]]. There are currently three wards of the Mendip Council in Street which elect councillors every four years. As of 2010 the two councillors for Street North are both [[Liberal Democrats]], Street West has one Liberal Democrat councillor and Street South is represented by two councillors one of which is a Liberal Democrat and the other is independent of any political party.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Councillors|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/council/councillors.asp?cat=-1|publisher=Mendip District Council|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref>

[[Somerset County Council]] is responsible for the largest and most expensive local services such as [[Local Education Authority|education]], [[social services]], [[library|libraries]], main roads, [[public transport]], [[police|policing]] and [[fire service]]s, [[trading standards]], [[waste disposal]] and strategic planning. Street is in the [[Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Wells]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] constituency, which elects one [[Member of Parliament|Member of Parliament (MP)]] by the [[first past the post]] system. The current MP is [[Tessa Munt]], elected in 2010, of the Liberal Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wells|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/f02.stm|work=2010 General Election Results|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> Street is also in the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]] which elects six [[Members of the European Parliament|MEPs]] using the [[d'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation]].

==Geography==
[[File:Street and Glastonbury Tor.jpg|thumb|Street and [[Glastonbury Tor]] taken from Walton Hill]]
The [[River Brue]] marks the boundary with Glastonbury to the north of the town. At the time of [[King Arthur]], the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by [[Arthurian legend]] as the home of the [[Lady of the Lake]]. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it was here that [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] is thought to have thrown the sword [[Excalibur]] into the waters after King Arthur fell at the [[Battle of Camlann]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Pomparles Bridge | work=ArthurianAdventure.com | url=http://www.arthurianadventure.com/pomparles_bridge.htm | accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref> The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pomparles Bridge, Northover, Glastonbury|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=23577|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>

Before the 13th century, the direct route to the sea at Highbridge was blocked by gravel banks and peat near Westhay.<ref>{{cite web | title=Meare and Ferran Mere | work=Sacred Sites around Glastonbury | url=http://www.isleofavalon.co.uk/sacredsites/meare.html | accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref> The course of the river partially encircled [[Glastonbury]] from the south, around the western side (through [[Beckery]]), and then north through the [[Panborough]]-[[Bleadney]] gap in the [[Wedmore]]-[[Wookey]] Hills, to join the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]] just north of Bleadney. This route made it difficult for the officials of [[Glastonbury Abbey]] to transport produce from their outlying estates to the Abbey, and when the valley of the river Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Sometime between 1230 and 1250, a new channel was constructed westwards into [[Meare Pool]] north of [[Meare]], and further westwards to [[Mark Moor]]. The [[Brue Valley Living Landscape]] is a [[Conservation biology|conservation]] project based on the [[Somerset Levels and Moors]] and managed by the [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brue Valley Living Landscape|url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/brue_valley.html|publisher=Somerset Wildlife Trust|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref>

The [[Walton and Ivythorn Hills]] [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] south of the town lies at the end of the [[Polden Hills]]. This site is owned and managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Walton and Ivythorn Hills support a complex mosaic of semi-natural habitats which includes unimproved calcareous grassland, dense and scattered scrub and broadleaved woodland. Structural diversity within the habitats, together with the extensive areas of sheltered wood-edge and scrub-edge margins provide ideal conditions for many species of [[invertebrate]]. [[Butterflies]], [[Leafhoppers]], [[Spiders]] and [[Stratiomyidae|Soldier Flies]] are particularly well represented. The [[Great Green Bush Cricket]]
(''Tettigonia viridissima'') is also of interest.<ref>{{cite web | title=Walton and Ivythorn Hills | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001144.pdf | accessdate=21 August 2006}}</ref> It is adjacent to the [[East Polden Grasslands]] which has typical examples of species-rich, unimproved, [[calcareous grassland]] with scrub and amongst the many plant species found in this habitat is the [[Gentianella|Early Gentian]] (''Gentianella anglica''), which is [[endemism|endemic]] to Britain. Its other main interest lies in its suitability as a habitat for the [[Large Blue (butterfly)|Large Blue]] [[butterfly]] (''Phengaris arion''), which has been successfully reintroduced onto the site. There are two nationally scarce [[grasshopper]] species present; [[Rufous Grasshopper]] (''Gomphocerippus rufus'') and [[Woodland Grasshopper]] (''Omocestus rufipes''). Several nationally scarce species of [[moth]], [[beetle]], [[bee]] and [[ant]] also occur.<ref>{{cite web | title=East Polden Grasslands | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000347.pdf | accessdate=12 August 2006}}</ref>

[[Street Heath]] is a [[Nature reserve]], managed by [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]], and has outstanding examples of communities which were once common on the [[Somerset Levels]]. The vegetation consists of wet and dry heath, species-rich bog and carr woodland, with transitions between all these habitats. Rare ferns present include [[Thelypteris palustris|Marsh Fern]] (''Thelypteris palustris'') and [[Osmunda regalis|Royal Fern]] (''Osmunda regalis''). Old [[peat]] workings and rhynes have a wetland community which includes [[Typha latifolia|Bulrush]] (''Typha latifolia''), [[Iris (plant)|Yellow Flag Iris]] (''pseudacorus''), [[Carex|Cyperus-like Sedge]] (''Carex pseudocyperus'') and [[Sparganium natans|Lesser Bur-reed]] (''Sparganium natans''). Insects recorded include 33 species of [[butterflies]], 200 [[moths]] and 12 [[grasshopper]]s and [[cricket (insect)|crickets]], with several notable rarities. Birds breeding in the carr woodland include the local [[Willow Tit]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Street Heath | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003617.pdf | accessdate=21 August 2006}}</ref>

[[File:Merriman Park, Street - geograph.org.uk - 81185.jpg|thumb|left|Merriman Park]]
Merriman Park is named after [[Nathaniel James Merriman]]. He was [[Curate]] then [[Vicar]] of Street,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Merriman Family|url=http://www.streetsociety.org/merriman.php|publisher=Street Society|accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> until he emigrated to [[South Africa]]. He rose to become [[Archdeacon]] of [[Grahamstown]] then [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[St. George's Cathedral, Cape Town|Cape Town]] before being elevated the [[Episcopate]].

Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Street has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|lk=on}} and shows a seasonal and a [[Diurnal motion|diurnal]] variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between {{convert|1|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} and {{convert|2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}}. July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around {{convert|21|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}}.<ref name="weather">{{cite web | title=About south-west England | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref> The south-west of England has a favoured location with respect to the [[Azores]] high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. [[Convective]] cloud often forms inland however, especially near hills, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,600&nbsp;hours.<ref name="weather"/> Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. Average rainfall is about {{convert|725|mm|in|}}. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.<ref name="weather"/>

The Clark family mansion and its estate at the edge of the village are now owned by [[Millfield School]]. The company, through the Society of Friends, also had its own small [[sanatorium]] and [[convalescent home]] on Ivythorne Hill overlooking the town. In 1931, this [[Swiss chalet style|chalet style]] building was leased to the [[Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales)|Youth Hostel Association]] and became the first [[youth hostel]] in Somerset.

==Transport==
In Roman times Street was close to the route of the [[Fosse Way]] and is now on the route of the modern [[A39 road]] which runs from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to [[Cornwall]], and the [[A361 road|A361]].

[[Glastonbury and Street railway station]] was the biggest station on the original [[Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway]] main line from Highbridge to [[Evercreech Junction railway station|Evercreech Junction]] until closed in 1966 under the [[Beeching axe]]. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services and one for the branch service to Wells. The station had a large goods yard controlled from a [[signal box]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Glastonbury|url=http://www.sdjr.net/locations/glastonbury.html|publisher=Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway|accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> The site is now a timber yard for a local company.
