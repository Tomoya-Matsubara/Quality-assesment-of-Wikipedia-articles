'''John MacBride''' (c. 1735 &ndash; 17 February 1800) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] and a politician who saw service during the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], eventually rising to the rank of [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|Admiral of the Blue]].

MacBride entered the navy after serving on merchant vessels and distinguished himself in a number of actions during the Seven Years' War, including cutting out a [[privateer]], which secured him the rank of [[post-captain]] by the end of the conflict. He was instrumental in establishing and securing a British settlement on the [[Falkland Islands]] in the years of peace which followed, and also performed service to the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] by transporting the [[George III of the United Kingdom|King's]] sister, [[Caroline Matilda of Great Britain|Caroline Matilda]]. Still in active service by the outbreak of war with the American colonies, MacBride took command of a [[ship of the line]] and saw action in engagements under [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Keppel]] and [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney]]. He was also active against privateers, capturing the ''Comte d'Artois'' in a heated battle off the Irish coast. Further service followed with [[Sir Hyde Parker, 5th Baronet|Parker's]] fleet against the Dutch and with [[Samuel Barrington|Barrington]] in the [[English Channel|Channel]]. 

MacBride ended the war serving ashore in Ireland, and in 1784 embarked on a political career, becoming [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth]]. Promoted to flag rank with the outbreak of war with [[Revolutionary France]], he commanded squadrons off the enemy coasts, and transported troops to support land operations on the continent. His last active service was in 1795, though he was promoted to Admiral of the Blue shortly before his death in 1800.

==Family and early life==
John MacBride was born in [[Scotland]] around 1735, the second son of the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister Robert MacBride.<ref name="Tracy232">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=232}}</ref> The MacBrides moved to [[Ireland]] shortly after John's birth, when Robert became minister of [[Ballymoney]], in [[County Antrim]]. John's brother, [[David MacBride]], became a noted medical writer.<ref name="DNB427">{{cite book | chapter=MacBride, John (d. 1800) | title=Dictionary of National Biography|year=1893|page=427}}</ref> John MacBride initially went to sea with the merchant service in 1751, and joined the navy as an [[able seaman]] three years later, in 1754.<ref name="DNB427"/><ref name="Tracy233">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=233}}</ref> He served first aboard the 24-gun {{HMS|Garland|1748|6}} in the [[West Indies]] for a number of years, before returning to British wars and serving aboard {{HMS|Norfolk|1757|6}}, the [[flagship]] in [[the Downs]] for a few months.<ref name="DNB427"/><ref name="Tracy233"/>

MacBride passed his lieutenant's examination on 6 October 1758, and received his commission on 27 October.<ref name="DNB427"/><ref name="Tracy233"/> He was moved into the hired [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Grace|1763|2}}, and in August 1761 came across a French [[privateer]] anchored in the [[Dunkirk]] [[roadstead]].<ref name="Tracy233"/> MacBride made contact with the frigate {{HMS|Maidstone|1758|6}} and asked her captain for four armed and manned boats.<ref name="Campbell275">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval History of Great Britain|page=275}}</ref> ''Maidstone''{{'}}s captain readily agreed, and at 10 o'clock that night the boats left the British ships and approached the privateer with muffled oars. They came within pistol shot and hailed the French vessel, and on receiving no reply, boarded her.<ref name="Campbell275"/> The British boarded on both sides of the vessel, and carried the ship with two men wounded. MacBride himself shot and killed the French lieutenant as he aimed a gun at the British boat.<ref name="Campbell275"/> The total French losses were two dead and five wounded. Having secured the vessel, the British took her out to sea under the guns of a French battery.<ref name="Campbell275"/>

MacBride's good service brought him a promotion to master and commander on 7 April 1762, and an appointment to command the [[fireship]] {{HMS|Grampus|1746|6}}.<ref name="Winfield306">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714&ndash;1792|page=306}}</ref> From there he moved to command the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Cruizer|1752|6}} on 27 May 1763, still at the rank of commander.<ref name="DNB427"/><ref name="Winfield310">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714&ndash;1792|page=310}}</ref> After some time spent on the Home station, MacBride received a promotion to [[post-captain]] on 20 June 1765, and took command of the 30-gun {{HMS|Renown|1747|6}}.<ref name="Campbell275"/><ref name="Winfield217">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714&ndash;1792|page=217}}</ref> This was followed in August 1765 with command of the 32-gun {{HMS|Jason|1763|6}}, and a mission to establish a colony on the [[Falkland Islands]].<ref name="Tracy233"/><ref name="Winfield191">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714&ndash;1792|page=191}}</ref>

==Falkland Islands==
MacBride arrived with ''Jason'', {{HMS|Carcass|1759|6}} and the storeship {{HMS|Experiment|1765|6}}, in January 1766, with orders to secure a settlement and to inform any existing inhabitants that the islands were a British possession.<ref name="Wheeler">{{cite book |last=Wheeler|title=The Falklands & South Georgia Island|page=18}}</ref><ref name="Armstrong5">{{cite book |last=Armstrong, et al |title=The Falkland Islands and their adjacent maritime area|page=5}}</ref> The British consolidated [[Port Egmont]], made several cruises in the surrounding waters, and in December came across the French settlement. In a cordial meeting MacBride informed the French governor M. de Neville of the British claim, which the French politely rejected.<ref name="Armstrong5"/> Unbeknownst to both de Neville and MacBride, [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who had established the French settlement, had agreed to sell the colony to Spain.<ref name="Armstrong5"/> The resulting tensions between the Spanish and British claims would nearly [[Falklands Crisis (1770)|lead to war in 1770]], but in the meantime MacBride returned home, reporting the situation to the government.<ref name="Armstrong5"/> He later published a 13-page [[monograph]], probably in 1770, entitled ''A Journal of the Winds and Weather...at Falkland Islands from 1 February 1766 to 19 January 1767''.<ref name="Tracy233"/>

==Interwar years==
After his return to Britain MacBride was given command of the 22-gun {{HMS|Seaford|1754|6}} in August 1767 and employed to cruise in the [[English Channel]].<ref name="Campbell275"/><ref name="Winfield256">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714&ndash;1792|page=256}}</ref> He spent several years aboard ''Seaford'', before transferring to take command of the 32-gun {{HMS|Arethusa|1759|6}} in March 1771, followed by the 32-gun {{HMS|Southampton|1757|6}} in August that year.<ref name="DNB428">{{cite book | chapter=MacBride, John (d. 1800) | title=Dictionary of National Biography|year=1893|page=428}}</ref>  He was in command of ''Southampton'' in May 1772 when he received orders to command a small squadron tasked with transporting [[Caroline Matilda of Great Britain|Caroline Matilda]], former [[Queen Consort|Queen]] of [[Denmark<U+2013>Norway|Denmark and Norway]] and sister of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], from [[Elsinore]] to [[Stadt]].<ref name="Tracy233"/> The squadron consisted of ''Southampton'', and two of MacBride's former commands,  ''Seaford'', and ''Cruizer''.<ref name="Beatson">{{cite book |last=Beatson|title=Naval and military memoirs of Great Britain|page=22}}</ref> In April 1773 he took command of {{HMS|Orpheus|1773|6}}.<ref name="DNB428"/>

==American War of Independence==
[[File:Combat d'Ouessant juillet 1778 par Theodore Gudin.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]]. MacBride saw little actual fighting in the confused engagement.]]
With the outbreak of war with the American colonies, MacBride was appointed to take command of the 64-gun {{HMS|Bienfaisant|1758|6}} on 6 November 1776.<ref name="DNB428"/>  He was present at the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] on 28 July 1778, but did not become heavily engaged in the confused action.<ref name="Tracy233"/> In the ensuing argument over the outcome of the battle, MacBride gave evidence in favour of Admiral [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Keppel]] that was an important factor in Keppel's acquittal at his court-martial.<ref name="Tracy233"/> MacBride was less supportive of [[Hugh Palliser|Sir Hugh Palliser]].<ref name="Tracy233"/> He remained in command of ''Bienfaisant'', and in December joined [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Sir George Rodney]]'s fleet to [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|relieve Gibraltar]].<ref name="Campbell276">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval History of Great Britain|page=276}}</ref> During the voyage the British fleet came across a Spanish convoy transporting naval stores from [[San Sebasti<U+00E1>n]] to [[C<U+00E1>diz]], and [[Action of 8 January 1780|engaged it]].<ref name="Tracy233"/> The British succeeded in capturing the convoy, while MacBride distinguished himself in engaging the Spanish flagship [[HMS Prince William (1780)|''Guipuscoana'']], which surrendered to him.<ref name="Tracy233"/> 
[[File:Holman, Cape St Vincent.jpg|thumb|left|The moonlight ''[[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle off Cape St Vincent]], 16 January 1780'' by [[Francis Holman]], painted 1780 shows the ''Santo Domingo'' exploding. MacBride had been heavily engaged with her just prior to her destruction.]]
On 16 January the fleet again encountered Spanish ships, this time off [[Cape St. Vincent]]. The Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Juan de L<U+00E1>ngara]], were engaged in the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], and again MacBride was in the thick of the action.<ref name="DNB428"/> He took his ship in to engage the ''San Domingo'', with the ''Bienfaisant'' narrowly escaping significant damage after her opponent blew up.  He then went on to chase down and capture L<U+00E1>ngara's flagship, the 80-gun [[Spanish ship Fenix (1749)|''Fenix'']].<ref name="Tracy233"/><ref name="DNB428"/> MacBride sent Lieutenant [[Thomas Louis]] aboard to take possession, but as a [[smallpox]] outbreak was raging on the ''Bienfaisant'', MacBride did not take the usual step of transferring some of the captured officers and men aboard his own ship.<ref name="Tracy233"/><ref name="Campbell277">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval History of Great Britain|page=277}}</ref> Instead he reached an agreement with de L<U+00E1>ngara, that should the ships encounter an French or Spanish force, he would allow the ''Fenix'' to be defended against them.<ref name="Charnock558">{{cite book |last=Charnock |title=Biographia Navalis|page=558}}</ref> If the ''Bienfaisant'' escaped but the ''Fenix'' was retaken, de L<U+00E1>ngara and his men would consider themselves to still be prisoners of war, but if ''Fenix'' escaped and ''Bienfaisant'' was taken, then de L<U+00E1>ngara and his men would be freed.<ref name="Charnock558"/> In any event both ships made it to Gibraltar without incident, after which MacBride was given the honour of taking Rodney's despatches back to Britain.<ref name="DNB428"/> MacBride set off at once, but was delayed by adverse winds. Consequently his despatches arrived several days after an identical set had reached London, delivered by Captain Edward Thomson, who had left Rodney later than MacBride, but who had had a faster voyage.<ref name="Charnock559">{{cite book |last=Charnock |title=Biographia Navalis|page=559}}</ref>

===MacBride and the Artois connection===
Rodney's fleet returned to Britain in March, and MacBride rejoined the ''Bienfaisant''. In early August a large French privateer, the 64-gun ''Comte d'Artois'', was reported to have sailed  from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to cruise off the Irish south coast.<ref name="Charnock559"/> MacBride was ordered to sail in company with the 44-gun {{HMS|Charon|1778|6}} and to capture the dangerous vessel.<ref name="Charnock559"/> After several days in search of the vessel, a mysterious sail was finally sighted early on 13 August, chasing after some of the ships of a convoy departing from [[Cork (city)|Cork]].<ref name="Campbell277"/> MacBride ranged up and fell in with the unidentified ship, which hoisted English colours. Both ships came within pistol shot, and it was not until there was some communication between the two ships, that MacBride could be satisfied of her identity.<ref name="Charnock559"/> By now the two ships were so close, with ''Bienfaisant'' off the ''Comte de'Artois''{{'}}s bow, that neither ship could bring their main guns to bear.<ref name="Charnock559"/> Instead both ships opened fire with [[musket]]s until MacBride could manoeuvre away and a general action ensued. After an hour and ten minutes the French vessel surrendered, having had 21 killed and 35 wounded, while ''Bienfaisant'' had three killed and 20 wounded.<ref name="Campbell278">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval History of Great Britain|page=278}}</ref> The ''Charon'' had only joined the action towards the end of the engagement and had a single man wounded.<ref name="Campbell278"/> The capture had an unusual sequel, for just over a year later, and under a different captain, ''Bienfaisant'' captured another privateer, this time named ''Comtesse d'Artois''.<ref name="Winfield91">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714&ndash;1792|page=91}}</ref>
[[File:Battle of Dogger Bank 1.jpeg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], 5 August 1781]]
In a further coincidence MacBride was appointed in January 1781 to command the 40-gun {{HMS|Artois|1780|6}}, a former French ship captured in 1780 by {{HMS|Romney|1762|6}}.<ref name="DNB428"/><ref name="Colledge">{{cite book |last=Colledge|title=Ships of the Royal Navy|page=22}}</ref> MacBride served in the [[North Sea]] with [[Sir Hyde Parker, 5th Baronet|Sir Hyde Parker's]] fleet, and fought against the Dutch at the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] on 5 August 1781.<ref name="Tracy233"/> After the battle Parker temporarily moved MacBride into the 80-gun {{HMS|Princess Amelia|1757|6}}, whose captain, John MacCartney, had been killed during the battle.<ref name="DNB428"/> MacBride resumed command of ''Artois'' after the fleet's return to port, and continued to cruise in the North Sea.<ref name="Tracy233"/> On 3 December he engaged and captured two large 24-gun Dutch privateers, the [[HMS Pylades (1781)|''Hercules'']] and [[HMS Orestes (1781)|''Mars'']].<ref name="Charnock561">{{cite book |last=Charnock |title=Biographia Navalis|page=561}}</ref> Nine men were killed and fifteen wounded on ''Mars'', while 13 were killed and 20 wounded on ''Hercules''.<ref name="Charnock561"/><ref name="Campbell279">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval History of Great Britain|page=279}}</ref> ''Artois'' had one man killed and six wounded.<ref name="Charnock561"/>

By 1782 MacBride was operating in the Channel, and in April was sent out as a scout ahead of the main force under Admiral [[Samuel Barrington]], which aimed to intercept a French squadron that had left Brest bound for the [[East Indies]].<ref name="Charnock561"/> He sighted the force on 20 April and alerted Barrington. The British moved in and that day and the following captured over half of the French force.<ref name="Campbell279"/> After this success MacBride was appointed to the Irish station in June, where he worked in the [[Impressment|impress service]] while ''Artois'' cruised under her first lieutenant.<ref name="Tracy233"/><ref name="DNB428"/>

==Years of peace==
At the end of the war with America, MacBride left the ''Artois'', but in June was able to obtain command of the 32-gun {{HMS|Druid|1783|6}}.<ref name="DNB428"/><ref name="Campbell279"/> He commanded her until the end of the year, after which he was temporarily unemployed at sea.<ref name="Campbell279"/><ref name="Charnock562">{{cite book |last=Charnock |title=Biographia Navalis|page=562}}</ref> MacBride took this opportunity to enter politics, and in 1784 he was elected as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth]], holding the seat until 1790.<ref name="Tracy233"/><ref name="DNB428"/> He gave several speeches on naval matters, and sat on the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond's]] commission into the defences of [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth]] between 1785 and 1786.<ref name="Tracy233"/> He opposed a plan for fortifying the naval dockyards, both on the commission and in parliament.<ref name="Campbell280">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval History of Great Britain|page=280}}</ref> In 1788 he returned to an active, though not a sea-going command, when he took over the Plymouth [[guardship]], the 74-gun {{HMS|Cumberland|1774|6}}.<ref name="Tracy233"/> By 1790, with the threat of the [[Spanish Armament]] looming, MacBride took ''Cumberland'' to [[Torbay]] to join the fleet assembling there under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]].<ref name="Campbell280"/>

==French Revolutionary Wars==
MacBride was promoted to rear-admiral on 1 February 1793, as part of the general promotion following the outbreak of war.<ref name="Charnock562"/> He became commander-in-chief on the Downs station, commanding a frigate squadron with his flag in ''Cumberland'', later transferring his flag to the 32-gun {{HMS|Quebec|1781|6}}.<ref name="Tracy233"/> He took possession of [[Ostend]] after the French retreat in early 1793, and in October transported reinforcements under General [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|Sir Charles Grey]] to assist in the defence of Dunkirk.<ref name="Campbell280"/> He took command of the 36-gun {{HMS|Flora|1780|6}} at the end of the year and sailed from Portsmouth on 1 December carrying an army under the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Earl of Moira]] to support French royalists in [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]].<ref name="Tracy234">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=234}}</ref>

Following this service he took command of a small squadron in the [[Western Approaches]], flying his flag in a number of different vessels, including the sloop {{HMS|Echo|1797|6}}, the 74-gun {{HMS|Minotaur|1793|6}} and the 64-gun {{HMS|Sceptre|1781|6}}.<ref name="Campbell281">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval History of Great Britain|page=281}}</ref> The squadron did not achieve any significant successes, and MacBride had the misfortune to break his leg while mounting his horse, forcing him to temporarily relinquish his duties.<ref name="Charnock563">{{cite book |last=Charnock |title=Biographia Navalis|page=563}}</ref> He was promoted to rear-admiral of the red on 11 April, and on 4 July to vice-admiral of the blue.<ref name="Tracy234"/><ref name="Charnock563"/> Promoted to vice-admiral of the white on 1 June 1795, MacBride became commander of the squadron in the North Sea assigned to watch the Dutch fleet in the [[Texel]], flying his flag in the 74-gun {{HMS|Russell|1764|6}}.<ref name="Campbell281"/> He stepped down from the post in late 1795, and was not actively employed at sea again. He was promoted to admiral of the blue on 14 February 1799.<ref name="Tracy234"/> Admiral John MacBride died of a paralytic seizure at the Spring Garden Coffee House, [[London]] on 17 February 1800.<ref name="Tracy234"/>

==Family and issue==
MacBride married early in his career, but no details are known, other than that his wife was the daughter of a naval officer. She is presumed to have died, for MacBride married Ursula Folkes, eldest daughter of William Folkes of [[Hillington, Norfolk|Hillington Hall]], [[Norfolk]] on 14 July 1774.<ref name="Tracy233"/><ref name="DNB428"/> Their son, [[John David MacBride]], became principal of [[Magdalen Hall]], [[Oxford]]. MacBride's daughter, Charlotte, married Admiral [[Willoughby Thomas Lake]] in 1795.<ref name="Tracy234"/><ref name="Charnock563"/>
