==Family history==

"[http://www.orato.com/arts-entertainment/2008/02/05/naptime-musings-jon-amp-kate-plus-8 Naptime Musings From Jon & Kate Plus 8]". [[Orato]]. Retrieved on July 3, 2008.</ref> She has three sisters and a brother. '''Jonathan Gosselin''' is the middle child of three boys. The couple met on October 5, 1997 at a picnic. They were married on June 12, 1999.

The Gosselin's desire to start a family was met with infertility. Kate underwent medical testing and was diagnosed with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]. The couple turned to fertility treatments and immediately began [[intrauterine insemination]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mosteller|first=Rachel|url=http://www.parentdish.com/2007/05/09/celebrity-dish-jon-and-kate-gosselin/|title=Celebrity Dish: Jon and Kate Gosselin|publisher=ParentDish|accessdate=June 17, 2008}}</ref>  By February 2000, Kate was pregnant with twins. On October 8, 2000, Cara Nicole and Madelyn "Mady" Kate Gosselin were born, six minutes apart.<ref name="Our Story">{{cite web |url=http://sixgosselins.com/Our_Story.html |title=Our Story |work=Sixgosselins.com |accessdate=June 14, 2008}}</ref>

On the couple's appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which aired on February 22, 2008, Kate admitted that she wanted to have another child, while Jon was hesitant because he felt like the world is built for a family of four. According to Kate, a biracial infant of a teenage girl became available to adopt while Kate was an [[obstetrics]] nurse. They decided not to adopt the baby, but instead returned to fertility treatment.<ref name="Our Story"/> By October, Kate was again pregnant. Five weeks later (after being hospitalized for over-stimulated ovaries), at the initial ultrasound, the doctor announced that there were six sacs with seven yolks ([[Human embryo|embryos]]). According to Kate, this was very emotional news for them. The doctor suggested [[selective reduction]], but the couple was absolutely against doing so.<ref name="Our Story"/>

The [[sextuplets]] were born on May 10, 2004 at [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]. All six children were delivered within a span of three minutes with more than fifty doctors, nurses, and other specialists involved. Since the sextuplets were born in Hershey, they were called "[[Hershey Kisses]]" by the nurses and doctors who delivered them. The family moved from their [[Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania]] home to a new residence in [[Wernersville, Pennsylvania|Wernersville]] in order to accommodate their unique living requirements.

==Production==
DiscoveryHealth starting filming the show in the form of two hour-long specials, then TLC  continued filming for a weekly series when the sextuplets were a year old.

Between the specials and the series, permanent light fixtures were installed in the Gosselins' home to facilitate filming and prevent the children from tripping over the wires and cables of temporary lighting. ''Jon & Kate Plus 8'' is filmed three days a week with one day set aside for the interview sessions where Jon, Kate, and occasionally the children, discuss the events which take place in each episode. Jon and Kate also work closely with producers to decide what themes will be presented in each episode. Jon and Kate have remarked that over the years the production crew has become part of the family since they have estranged themselves from their own family.<ref name="KoreAm">{{cite web|url=http://www.koreamjournal.com/Magazine/index.php/kj/2008/may/cover_story/just_the_10_of_us/(page)/1| title=JUST THE 10 OF US | publisher=''[[KoreAm Journal]]''| author=Woo, Michelle| date=May 2008| accessdate=August 7, 2008}}</ref>
