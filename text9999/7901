==Design and development==
The [[Saryu class patrol vessel]] were one of the ships which were ordered by the Ministry of Defence for the navy, after the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|26/11 attack in Mumbai]] in 2008, for coastal patral duties.<ref name=zn21d /> According to [[Goa Shipyard Limited]]'s chairman and managing director Rear Admiral (Retd) Vineet Bakhshi, GSL has become India's first shipyard with the capability to design and build naval warships indigenously.<ref name=bs19 />

INS Saryu is the most advanced vessel constructed by GSL in terms of design, performance and quality. The ship has been designed by an in-house design team and was built at the cost of {{INRConvert|620|c|0}}.<ref name=dc19 /> Construction of the vessel took 3 and a half years, due to a delay in the supply of gearboxes by the Indian supplier. The gearboxes were them ordered from an OEM. These were delivered in early December 2011. ''Saryu'' was then completed by November, 2012. Three more NOPVs are being constructed for the navy, which will be delivered in the next 18 months, at an interval of 6 months.<ref name=idp20j>{{cite web|title=INS Saryu Class Stealth OPVs|url=http://idp.justthe80.com/naval-projects/offshore-patrol-vessels/ins-saryu-class-stealth-opvs|work=Naval Projects|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Delay in Modernisation Program|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=77405|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=Press Information Bureau}}</ref><ref name=toij19>{{cite news|title=Indian Navy to commission indigenously built NOPV INS Saryu|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-19/goa/36431853_1_naval-offshore-patrol-vessel-ins-saryu-indian-navy|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=nt20>{{cite web|title=India about to commission OPV INS Saryu|url=http://navaltoday.com/2013/01/18/indian-navy-about-to-commission-opv-ins-saryu-into-service/|publisher=Naval Today|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=nvht>{{cite news|title=INS Saryu ready for commissioning|url=http://www.navhindtimes.in/business/ins-saryu-ready-commissioning|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=Navhind Times|date=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=bs19 />
