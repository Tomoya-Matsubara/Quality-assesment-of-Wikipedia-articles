'''Jack Roosevelt "Jackie" Robinson''' (January 31, 1919 <U+2013> October 24, 1972) was the first [[African American|black]] [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) player of the modern era.<ref>[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 6.</ref> Robinson broke the [[baseball color line]] when he debuted with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947. As the first black man to play in the major leagues since the 1880s, he was instrumental in bringing an end to [[racial segregation]] in professional baseball, which had relegated black players to the [[Negro leagues]] for six decades.<ref name="Loewen"/> The example of his character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights Movement]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=World & I |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=257<U+2013>273 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2003/march/mtpub.asp |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson: precursors of the civil rights movement |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last=Glasser |first=Ira }}</ref><ref name="OneMeeting">{{cite web |publisher=MLB.com |url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&content_id=2529821 |title=One meeting, two men, a changed world |first=Justice B. |last=Hill |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=September 14, 2009 }}</ref>

In addition to his cultural impact, Robinson had an exceptional baseball career. Over ten seasons, he played in six [[World Series]] and contributed to the Dodgers' [[1955 World Series|1955 World Championship]]. He was selected for six consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] from 1949 to 1954,<ref name="BRef.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinja02.shtml |title=Jackie Robinson statistics and history |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 4, 2009}}</ref> was the recipient of the inaugural [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|MLB Rookie of the Year Award]] in 1947, and won the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] in 1949 <U+2013> the first black player so honored.<ref>[[#Nemec|Nemec & Flatow]], p. 201.</ref> Robinson was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1962|1962]]. In 1997, Major League Baseball [[Uniform number (Major League Baseball)#Retirement of numbers|retired]] his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams.

Robinson was also known for his pursuits outside the baseball diamond. He was the first black television analyst in Major League Baseball, and the first black vice-president of a major American corporation. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in [[Harlem]], New York. In recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

== Early life ==
Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] in [[Cairo, Georgia]], during a [[Spanish flu]] and [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]]. He was the youngest of five children, after siblings Edgar, Frank, [[Matthew Robinson (athlete)|Matthew]] (nicknamed "Mack"), and Willa Mae.<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 15.</ref><ref name="Bigelow">[[#Bigelow|Bigelow]], p. 225.</ref> His middle name was in honor of former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who died twenty-five days before Robinson was born.<ref>[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 7.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/kids/dreamteam/jackierobinson.html |title=White House dream team: Jackie Roosevelt Robinson |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |date=January 20, 2002 |publisher=Whitehousekids.gov }}</ref> After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to [[Pasadena, California]].<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 15<U+2013>18</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jackierobinson.com/about/bio.html |title=Biography |publisher=Official Site of Jackie Robinson |accessdate=April 9, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Robinsonp9">[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 9.</ref> The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena.

=== John Muir High School ===
In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at [[John Muir High School (Pasadena, California)|John Muir High School]] (Muir Tech).<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 36.</ref> Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics|silver medalist]] at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]])<ref name=Eigp10/> and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.<ref name="biography.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Jackie-Robinson-9460813?print |title=Jackie Robinson biography |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |publisher=The Biography Channel }}</ref><ref name=Robinson2p20/> At Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the [[varsity team|varsity level]] and [[Letterman (sports)|lettered]] in four of them: [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[baseball]].<ref name="Robinsonp9"/> He played [[shortstop]] and [[catcher]] on the baseball team, [[quarterback]] on the football team, and [[Shooting guard|guard]] on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the [[long jump|broad jump]]. He was also a member of the [[tennis]] team.<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 36<U+2013>37.</ref>

In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famers]] [[Ted Williams]] and [[Bob Lemon]].<ref name=Rampp37>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 37.</ref> In late January 1937, the ''[[Pasadena Star-News]]'' newspaper reported that Robinson "for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis."<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 39.</ref>

=== Pasadena Junior College ===
After Muir, Robinson attended [[Pasadena City College|Pasadena Junior College]] (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track.<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 40<U+2013>41.</ref> On the football team, he played quarterback and [[Safety (American football position)|safety]]. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad jump records held by his brother Mack.<ref name=Robinsonp9/> As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white.<ref name=Rampp37/> While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military.<ref>[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 44.</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=[[Media:INTERVIEW Jackie Robinson U.pdf|Sports: Jackie Robinson]] |first=Bob |last=Stone |date=November 23, 1945 |work=[[Yank, the Army Weekly]] |volume=4 |issue=23 |format=PDF}}</ref> Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 47.</ref> In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.<ref name=Robinson2p20>[[#Robinson2|Robinson, Rachel]], p. 20.</ref><ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], p. 54.</ref> That year, Robinson was one of ten students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger (''Omicron Mu Delta''), awarded to students performing "outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition."<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 59<U+2013>60.</ref>

An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist <U+2013> a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police.<ref name="Linge, p. 18">[[#Linge|Linge]], p. 18.</ref> Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident <U+2013> along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police <U+2013> gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism.<ref>[[#Rampersad|Rampersad]], pp. 50<U+2013>51.</ref> Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.<ref name=Robinson2p20/><ref>[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 51.</ref>

=== UCLA and afterward ===

After graduating from PJC in spring 1939,<ref>[[#Falkner|Falkner]], p. 49.</ref> Robinson transferred to UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win [[varsity letter]]s in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.<ref>[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 11.</ref><ref name=memory1940/> He was one of four black players on the 1939 [[UCLA Bruins football]] team; the others were [[Woody Strode]], [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]], and Ray Bartlett.

In 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]]. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race-neutral, practically speaking few black applicants were admitted into OCS  until after subsequent directives by Army leadership.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=G.P.O. |isbn=1153755394 |title=Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-65 |last=MacGregor |first=Morris J. |year=1981 |location=Washington, D.C. |footnote=94 |chapter=Chapter 2: World War II: The Army |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-02.htm |id=n. 94}}</ref> As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months.<ref name=Robinsonp13>[[#Robinson|Robinson, Jackie]], p. 13.</ref> After protests by heavyweight boxing champion [[Joe Louis]] (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of [[Truman Gibson]] (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War),<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/mss/text/gibson.html |title=Library of Congress: Truman K.

Other teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer.

In 1946, Robinson arrived at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], for [[spring training]] with the [[Montreal Royals]] of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]] [[International League]] (the designation of "AAA" for the highest level of [[minor league baseball]] was first used in the {{by|1946}} season).

=== Major leagues ===
==== Breaking the color barrier (1947) ====

The following year, six days before the start of the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. With [[Eddie Stanky]] entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a [[first baseman]].<ref name=schwartz/> On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at [[Ebbets Field]] before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons.<ref name=McNeil357/> Although he failed to get a base hit, the Dodgers won 5<U+2013>3.<ref name=McNeil357>[[#McNeil|McNeil]], p. 357.</ref> Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line.<ref name=Kirsch>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Ethnicity and Sports in the United States|author=Kirsch, George B., Othello Harris, and Claire Elaine Nolte, eds.|year=2000 |isbn=0313299110 |publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT |pages=12, 336|chapter=The Right to Travel}}</ref>  Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.<ref name="Satch2"/>

Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.<ref name=SABRbio/><ref>For a general survey of the media reaction to Robinson at various phases of his career, ''see'' [http://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/jackie/proball.html www.umass.edu] and subpages.

The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager [[Leo Durocher]] informed the team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded."<ref>[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 198.</ref>

Robinson was also derided by opposing teams. Some, notably the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], threatened to [[Strike action|strike]] if Robinson played. After the threat, National League President [[Ford Frick]] and [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Happy Chandler]] let it be known that any striking players would be suspended.<ref>[[#Kirwin|Kirwin]], p. 199.</ref><ref>[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 95.</ref><ref>[[#Bryant|Bryant]], p. 70.</ref> Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals).

Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players entered the major leagues. [[Larry Doby]] (who broke the color barrier in the [[American League]] on July 5, 1947) and [[Satchel Paige]] played for the [[Cleveland Indians]], and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson.<ref name="McNeil94"/> In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12500|1948}}}} today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a [[vaudeville]] tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions, and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp {{Convert|30|lb|kg}} overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate.<ref>[[#Linge|Linge]], pp. 71<U+2013>72.</ref>

In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer [[George Sisler]], working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field.<ref name=Sizzler/> Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball.<ref name=Sizzler/> Robinson also noted that "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second".<ref name=Sizzler/> The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.<ref name=Sizzler>{{cite book |title=The Sizzler: George Sisler, Baseball's Forgotten Great |last=Huhn |first=Rick |year=2004 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia |isbn=0826215556 |chapter=Full circle |page=260 }}</ref> In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 [[Run batted in|runs batted in]] with 122 runs scored.<ref name=schwartz/> For the performance Robinson earned the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] award for the National League.<ref name=schwartz/> Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] <U+2013> the first All-Star Game to include black players.<ref>In addition to Robinson, the 1949 All-Star game featured [[Larry Doby]], [[Roy Campanella]], and [[Don Newcombe]].

Before the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career. O'Malley was quoted in the ''Montreal Standard'' as saying, "Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post" <U+2013> although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robinson Linked to Montreal Job |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press |date=March 25, 1951 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TAMiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cE0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3670,3811383&hl=en |page=37}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Robinson Offered Managerial Berth |date=March 25, 1951 |page=27 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HUUuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PtoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5339,1955903&hl=en}}</ref> 

During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137.<ref name="lester"/> He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant.  During the last game of the season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th.  This forced a playoff against the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], which the Dodgers lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bitker|first=Steve|title=The Original San Francisco Giants: The Giants of '58|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2001|page=196|isbn=9781582613352}}</ref>

Despite Robinson's regular-season heroics, the Dodgers lost the pennant on [[Bobby Thomson]]'s famous home run, known as the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]], on October 3, 1951. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases.

==== World Championship and retirement (1954<U+2013>1956) ====

His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles.<ref name="stats"/><ref name="lester"/> The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the [[1955 World Series]]. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a [[third baseman]], both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base.<ref>[[#Eig|Eig]], p. 269.</ref> Robinson, then 37 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series.<ref name="Impact"/> Robinson missed the game because manager [[Walter Alston]] decided to play Gilliam at second and [[Don Hoak]] at third base.

Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line.<ref name=Kirsch/> After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration of to the North, where their political clout grew, and [[Harry Truman|President Harry Truman]]'s [[Military history of African Americans|desegregation of the military]] in 1948.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/17/opinion/better-late-than-never.html|title=Better Late Than Never|last=Klarman|first=Michael J. |date=May 17, 2004|work=New York Times|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref> Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter.

Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers.<ref name="Sports 20000"/> During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games.<ref name="BRef.com"/>  In 1999, he was posthumously named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp?story=2|title=The All-Century Team|year=1999|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref>

Robinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post<U+2013>"long ball" era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Jackie Robinson and the Third Age of Modern Baseball |last=Shiner |first=David |title=[[#Dorinson|Jackie Robinson: Race, Sports, and the American Dream]] |pages=151<U+2013>152 }}</ref> Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era.

<sup>a</sup> The [[sacrifice fly]] (SF) as a unique statistical category did not exist in Major League Baseball from 1940 through 1953. Any pre-1954 sacrifice flies by Robinson would be reflected in the [[sacrifice bunt|sacrifice hit]] (SH) category.

<sup>b</sup> Likewise, the [[intentional base on balls|intentional walk]] (IBB) category only became a unique statistic beginning in 1955.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/touchingbase/2008/08/walk-this-way-intentional-pass.html |work=[[New York Daily News]] |title=Walk this way: Intentional pass with bags packed works |last=Spector |first=Jesse |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}</ref> Any intentional walks issued to Robinson before that year would be reflected in the [[bases on balls|walk]] (BB) category.
