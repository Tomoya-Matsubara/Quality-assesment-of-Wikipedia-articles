Since then, they have released several hit singles and award-winning works, including a total of fifteen [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]].<ref name="ARIA-history">{{cite web|url=http://ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=P&artist=Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger ARIA awards history|accessdate=2007-08-08|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]}}</ref> Numerous Powderfinger albums have reached [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] status multiple times, and rankings in the top 100 of [[ARIA Charts|Australian music charts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/search.asp?search=powderfinger&cat=a|title=Powderfinger albums chart rankings|accessdate=2007-10-20|publisher=australian-charts.com}}</ref> ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'', Powderfinger's most successful to date, earned over eight platinum certifications and ARIA Awards in five different categories.<ref name="aria-accred-2004albums">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2004.htm|title=2004 Album Accreditations|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>

The aim of their recent tour was to promote the efforts of [[Reconciliation Australia]], and to promote awareness of the 17-year gap in life expectancy between [[Indigenous Australia|Indigenous]] and non-Indigenous children.<ref name="thedwarf" />

=== Formation and early releases (1989<U+2013>1993) ===
Powderfinger was formed in 1989 by vocalist and guitarist [[Ian Haug]], bassist [[John Collins]] and drummer [[Steven Bishop]],<ref name="h2g2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A695531|title=Powderfinger - The Band|accessdate=2007-10-25|date=[[February 13]], [[2002]]|publisher=BBC h2g2}}</ref> who took their name from the name of a [[Neil Young]] song.<ref name="rockd">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist,6959.sm;jsessionid=EAFDD28E94BFB39BE30184BC24855E3D.rd1|title=Powderfinger on Rockdetector}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Internationalists|publisher=JUICE Magazine|date=November 2001|author=Munro, Kelsey|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref> Before the band's formation, the members had all played in other Brisbane-based outfits.<ref name="pch">{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/history.htm|title=Band history|accessdate=2007-10-25|publisher=Powderfinger Central|date=2007}}</ref> The band later sought an extra guitarist, [[Bernard Fanning]], who Haug had met in a [[university]] class.<ref name="hindley-bios">{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/bios/bios.htm#Bernard%20Fanning|title=Bernard Fanning biography|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> Fanning took over the role of [[lead singer|lead vocals]] from Haug, before Bishop officially left the band and was replaced by [[Jon Coghill]].

Powderfinger initially performed [[cover version]]s of other artists' songs, but gradually developed into writing their own material.<ref name="rockd" /> In 1992, the group self-funded a recording of their early works and released them as a [[Powderfinger (EP)|self-titled]] [[extended play]], more commonly known as the ''Blue EP''.<ref name="h2g2" /> The EP became successful and the group was signed to [[Polydor Records]], a major record label in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref name="amg-bio" /> Upon its release in 1993, ''[[Transfusion (EP)|Transfusion]]'' reached #1 spot on the [[alternative music|Alternative]] [[ARIA Charts]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Powderfinger|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|author=McPherson, Matthew|date=January 1994|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref> replacing [[Nirvana]]'s "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]".<ref name="hindleysite">{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/history/history.htm|title=Powderfinger band history|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> The group recorded their first music video for the EP's lead track "Reap What You Sow" with director David Barker, who went on to direct the following seven videos for the group.<ref name="db">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#2p1|title=Have powderfinger made any video clips for their singles?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|author=Rice, Stephen; et al|accessdate=2007-10-18|date=[[September 23]], [[2003]]|publisher=Powderfinger Central}}</ref>

=== Early albums (1994<U+2013>1998) ===
Powderfinger released their debut [[studio album]] ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]'' under Polydor on [[July 18]], [[1994]]. The album, which Fanning describes as the band's "dark days", received limited radio coverage.<ref name="hindleysite" /> Following the release, the band toured heavily appearing at the [[Livid]] and [[Homebake]] [[music festival]]s,<ref>{{cite news|title=Make mine a double|author=Lawrence, Angie|accessdate=2007-10-25|date=1996|publisher=''[[Rave (magazine)|Rave]]''}}</ref> including an appearance at one of Australia's largest [[List of Australian music festivals|music festival]] [[Big Day Out]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigdayout.com/history/pastlineups.php#1994|title=Big Day Out lineups history|publisher=[[Big Day Out]]|accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> Three singles were released from the album: "[[Tail (song)|Tail]]", "[[Grave Concern]]", and "[[Save Your Skin]]". ''Parables for Wooden Ears'' was regarded by many as Powderfinger's worst album, and its poor reviews are indicative of this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pubsandclubs.net.au/articles/index/118|title=Powderfinger: A Rock Band That Have Withstood The Test Of Time|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=Pubs and Clubs Australia|date=[[July 25]], [[2007]]}}</ref> Following the album's release, the group recorded and released another EP entitled ''Mr Kneebone'' in 1995.

The band released the highly successful ''[[Double Allergic]]'' on [[September 2]], [[1996]]; this, their second album, reached double platinum status in Australia.<ref name="aria-accred-2007albums">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/httpwww.aria.com.aupagesARIACharts-Accreditations-2007Albums.htm|title=2007  Album Accreditations|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> Four singles were released from the album; "[[Pick You Up]]", "[[D.A.F.

=== Critical acclaim and chart success (1998<U+2013>2003) ===
In September 1998, Powderfinger released ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'', their third studio album. It propelled Powderfinger to a prominent position on the Australian music scene, reaching #1 and later spending 100 weeks on the [[ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.take40.com/artist/facts/Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger - Audio, Video, News, Biography, Quick and Juicy facts|work=Powderfinger - Top 5 Facts|publisher=Take 40|accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref> The album, which sold over 280,000 copies and went over five times platinum domestically,<ref name="FAQsales">{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#3p9|date=[[September 23]], [[2002]]|title=How many copies of the albums have been sold?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|author=Rice, Stephen; et al|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> reached [[Europe]]an audiences for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Day Dream Believers|author=Six, Nicola|accessdate=2007-10-26|date=[[November 19]], [[1998]]|publisher=''[[The Courier Mail]]''|work=Pulse}}</ref> ''Internationalist'' was the first Powderfinger album to win [[ARIA Music Awards]] from the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]].

The band received much praise and criticism for the political views in several tracks on ''Internationalist''. In an interview with Benedict Watts, guitarist Ian Haug said that the political messages in "[[The Day You Come]]" were not something preached about, but were something they saw as a responsibility.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Beckoning Finger|date=November 1998|publisher=JUICE Magazine|accessdate=2007-10-25|author=Watts, Benedict}}</ref>

Powderfinger's fourth studio album, ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'', was released in September 2000, shortly after they were asked to write songs for the soundtracks of two films; ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]''. The song "[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]" was written for ''Two Hands'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=10528|title=''Two Hands'' soundtrack|publisher=Soundtrack Collector|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> and "[[My Kind of Scene]]" was written for ''Mission: Impossible II''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/mykindascene.htm|title="My Kind of Scene"|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> ''Odyssey Number Five'' was Powderfinger's most successful to date; selling 560,000 copies.<ref name="aria-accred-2004albums" /> "My Kind of Scene" was also released as a single from the album, as were four other songs; "[[My Happiness (Powderfinger song)|My Happiness]]", "[[Like a Dog]]", "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre]]", and "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]".<ref>"[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre]]" and "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]" were released as a double [[A-side]].</ref> ''Odyssey Number Five'' won [[ARIA Awards]] in 2001 for "Album of the Year", "Highest Selling Album", "Best Rock Album", "Best Cover Art", and "Best Group".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alldownunder.com/oz-p/aria/2001-aria.htm|title=2001 ARIA Award Winners|publisher=ALLdownunder.com|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref> "My Happiness" was also awarded "Single of the Year",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=2001|title=ARIA Awards 2001|work=History|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> and other songs were nominated for ARIA Awards in different categories.<ref name="AllARIA">{{cite web|url=http://www.alldownunder.com/oz-p/aria/total-aria.htm|title=Australia ARIA Award Winners|publisher=ALLdownunder.com|accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

''[[Vulture Street]]'' was released on [[July 4]], [[2003]]. The album, recorded in January and February 2003, was named after a street in [[West End, Queensland]], which was the location of the band's first recording room. The album was described by critics as "a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album", and that it featured guitarists Middleton and Haug dominating in a way they have not since their 1994 debut.<ref name="SMGVulture">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/10/1057783275797.html|title=Powderfinger, Vulture Street|author=Zuel, Bernard|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> Simon Evans of [[musicOMH.com]] described the band as having "opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/powderfinger.htm|title=Vulture Street album review|publisher=[[musicOMH.com]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|author=Evans, Simon}}</ref>

Four singles were released from ''Vulture Street''; "[[(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind]]", "[[Since You've Been Gone (Powderfinger song)|Since You've Been Gone]]", "[[Love Your Way]]", and "[[Sunsets]]".  Like earlier Powderfinger albums, ''Vulture Street'' won several ARIA Awards; in 2003, it won "Album of the Year", "Best Group", "Best Rock Album", and "Best Cover Art".<ref name="AllARIA" /> Several songs on the album were also nominated for awards, in 2003 and 2004.

''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]'' was the first live release by Powderfinger. Both the [[CD]] and [[DVD]] versions were released in late-2004. One single was released from the album; "[[Stumblin']]", a song which originally appeared on ''Vulture Street'' as a normal track. Powderfinger released a "[[best of]]" album weeks later entitled ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000]]''. It included many of the band's singles to date and included the unreleased tracks "[[Powderfinger's Oi Song Trilogy#Thrilloilogy|Thrilloilogy]]" and "Belter", and a re-release of "[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]". "These Days", although never officially released as a single, was ranked at #1 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100]] poll of [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1999|1999]].<ref name="triplej-1999" /> The album also included two new songs; "[[Bless My Soul]]" and "Process This", although only "Bless My Soul" was released as a single. 

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], Powderfinger appeared at the [[WaveAid]] fundraising concert in [[Sydney]], to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster affected areas.<ref name="waveaid-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/events/1673/|title=WaveAid @ Sydney Cricket Ground|publisher=FasterLouder|accessdate=2007-08-08|date=[[January 30]], [[2005]]}}</ref> Fanning sang for [[The Wrights]] when they performed "[[Evie (song)|Evie]]" at the concert and released a studio version of the song as a single, with the proceeds from the sale also going to tsunami fundraising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2005/jan05/20050107_wrights.html|title=Nic Cester Supergroup Christened to Wrights|publisher=Undercover|date=2005|author=Cashmere, P|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
In an interview with Paul Cashmere after the release of ''Vulture Street'', guitarist Darren Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had written "were just too ''Odyssey Number Five'' based", and that the first track, "Rockin' Rocks", was "probably the start of where we were heading" with the album.<ref name="cashmere-interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/powderfinger.html|title=Powderfinger, Interview|author=Cashmere, Paul|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> Cashmere stated in the interview that the album was "the toughest [he has] heard Powderfinger sound".<ref name="cashmere-interview" />

Bernard Zuel of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewed both of Powderfinger's more recent albums. Describing ''Vulture Street'' as "a rawer, louder" album in comparison to ''Odyssey Number Five'', Zuel highlighted on Fanning's "talent as a lyricist" and stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton "dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut".<ref name="SMGVulture" /> Zuel stated that there is a "real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger", and described "On My Mind" as having "[[AC/DC]] meatiness", and "Love Your Way" as "acoustic tumbling into weaving [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]] lines".<ref name="SMGVulture" />

In his review of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', Zuel described it as "[having] high-gloss and muscular framework", and that stated that this is what "American radio considers serious rock".<ref name="SMH-Dream Days" /> 

{{cquote2|1=Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy.

Clayton Bolger of [[All Music Guide]] stated in his review of ''Dream Days'' that Powderfinger "largely revisit the sound of their ''Internationalist'' album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's ''Vulture Street''".<ref name="dreamdays-amg">{{cite web|url=http://wm09.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gnfrxz95ldfe~T1|title=''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' review|publisher=All Music Guide|author=Bolger, Clayton|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> He highlighted on Fanning's "commanding and distinctive vocals", the "twin-guitar attack" of Middleton and Haug, Collins' "innovative basslines", and the "powerhouse drum work" of Coghill.<ref name="dreamdays-amg" />

Powderfinger consists of five members: [[vocal]]ist, [[guitar]]ist, [[keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] and [[harmonica|harmonicist]] [[Bernard Fanning]]; [[bass guitar]]ist [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]]; guitarist and [[backing vocalist]] [[Ian Haug]]; guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist [[Darren Middleton]]; and [[drum]]mer and [[percussion]]ist [[Jon Coghill]] &ndash; this has remained the lineup of the band since 1992. [[Steven Bishop]] had been the group's drummer before this, but had left due to study commitments.<ref name="band-members" /> The band often refers to one another with partial pseudonyms: most notably, John Collins and Jon Coghill, presumably to avoid confusion, are referred to as JC and Cogsy respectively.<ref name="cashmere-interview" />

Powderfinger has collaborated with few artists, but have had session pianist [[Benmont Tench]] play on ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1898994.htm|title=New Powderfinger album details|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Triple J|accessdate=2007-10-26|date=[[April 17]], [[2007]]}}</ref> For their second album, ''Double Allergic'', the group enlisted producer Tim Whitten. Powderfinger approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for ''Internationalist'', and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in [[Melbourne]], Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/discog/inter.htm|title=''Internationalist''|work=Powderfinger discography|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref> Satisfied with the work with him, the group called upon DiDia again for the following two albums, effectively making him the producer for the group's three most awarded albums. The group decided to break the streak in 2007 when they called upon [[Rob Schnapf]], producer for [[United States|American]] musician [[Beck]], to produce their sixth studio effort in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s1932552.htm|title=''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2007-10-25|date=[[May 25]], [[2007]]}}</ref>
