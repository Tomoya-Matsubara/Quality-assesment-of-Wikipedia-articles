The '''Silver Jubilee Bridge''' crosses the [[River Mersey]] and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] at [[River Mersey#Runcorn Gap|Runcorn Gap]] between [[Runcorn]] and [[Widnes]] in [[Cheshire]], England. It is a [[compression arch suspended-deck bridge]] (or through arch bridge) which was opened in 1961 and widened in 1975<U+2013>77.  It carries the [[A533 road]] and a [[cantilever]]ed footway.  The bridge is a grade II [[listed building]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=56066 |title=Images of England: Runcorn-Widnes Road Bridge|accessdate= 2007-12-16  |publisher=[[English Heritage]] }}</ref>

== History ==

Until 1868, when [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]] was opened,<ref>Differing dates have been given for the date of opening. Building of the bridge was completed in 1868 and on 21 May there was an introductory opening when a short train crossed the bridge.  It was formally opened for traffic on 10 October but the first goods traffic did not cross it until 1&nbsp;February 1869. (ref. Cowan, C. A. ''Crossing the Runcorn Gap, Vol. 3: Runcorn Railway Bridge'', Halton Borough Council, 1990.) </ref> the only means of crossing the Mersey at or near Runcorn Gap were by fording or by ferry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anon.|1978|pp=1<U+2013>6.}}</ref>  Before that the lowest crossing of the river had been the road bridge at [[Warrington]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=166.}}</ref>  The first bridge to carry vehicular traffic across Runcorn Gap was the [[Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge]] which opened in 1905.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|pp=212<U+2013>215.}}</ref> This was an inefficient means of transport and it had become inadequate for the amount of traffic using it before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]].  In 1946 the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] agreed that the [[transporter bridge]] should be replaced when sufficient funds were available.  [[Mott, Hay and Anderson]] were appointed as consultant engineers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=3<U+2013>4.}}</ref>

==Planning==

The new bridge had to allow the passage of shipping along the [[Manchester Ship Canal]].  Many ideas were considered, including a new transporter bridge or a [[swing bridge]].  These were considered to be impractical and it was decided that the best solution was a high-level bridge upstream from the railway bridge.  This would allow the least obstruction to shipping and would also be at the narrowest crossing point.  The first plan for a high-level bridge was a [[truss bridge]] with three or five spans, giving a {{convert|24|ft|m|0}} [[dual carriageway]] with a cycle track and footpaths.  This was abandoned because it was too expensive, and because one of the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] would be too close to the wall of the ship canal.  The next idea was for a [[suspension bridge]] with a span of {{convert|1030|ft|m|0}} between the main towers with a {{convert|24|ft|m|0}} single carriageway and a {{convert|6|ft|m|0}} footpath.  However [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] tests on models of the bridge showed that, while the bridge itself would be stable, the presence of the adjacent railway bridge would cause severe [[oscillation]].  The finally accepted design was for a steel [[arch bridge]] with a {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} single carriageway.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=4<U+2013>5.}}</ref>  The design of the bridge is similar to that of [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] but differs from it in that the side spans are continuous with the main span rather than being separate from them.  This design feature was necessary to avoid the problem of oscillation due to the railway bridge.  The main span measures {{convert|1082|ft|m|0}} and each side span is {{convert|250|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|p=6.}}</ref>

==Construction==

This began on 25 April 1956.  The contractors for the first phase of work, [[Leonard Fairclough & Son|Leonard Fairclough]] of [[Adlington, Lancashire|Adlington]], cleared the ground and constructed the foundations for the piers.  The contract for the second phase, the building of the main arch and the side arches, was given to [[Dorman Long]] who sub-contracted the building of the bridge deck, viaduct and roadworks to Leonard Fairclough.  Building of the bridge itself began in March 1958 and the side spans were completed by November 1959.  The main arch was built by cantilevering steelwork from the side spans until it met in the middle in November 1960.  The carriageway was suspended from the arch by 48 lock-coil wire ropes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=6, 9<U+2013>15.}}</ref>  From February 1960 approach roads and [[viaduct]]s were being built on both sides of the river; the total length of viaduct constructed was {{convert|1574|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=21<U+2013>24.}}</ref> The approaches on the Runcorn side blocked the [[Bridgewater Canal]] at Waterloo Bridge and the line of locks leading down to the Mersey were filled in.<ref>{{Harvnb|Starkey|1990|p=221.}}</ref>  The bridge was officially opened on 21 July 1961 by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=28<U+2013>30.}}</ref>

==Statistics==

The main arch is {{convert|1082|ft|m|0}} long and each side arch measures {{convert|250|ft|m|0}}.  During its construction 720,000 [[rivet]]s were used.  Its height over the river bed is {{convert|285|ft|m|0}} and the headroom over the ship canal is {{convert|80|ft|m|0}}.  During its construction 5,900 tons of steel were used and 7,500 tons of concrete.  The bridge requires constant repainting and for this one coat uses {{convert|6000|impgal|l|0}} of paint. On the Runcorn side, the approach viaducts are {{convert|1076|ft|m|0}} in length, and on the Widnes side {{convert|498|ft|m|0}}.  The cost of constructing the bridge was <U+00A3>2,433,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|p=44.}}</ref>  At the time of its construction it had the third longest steel arch span in the world.  It had the longest vehicular span in the country, but this record was held for only a few weeks until the [[Tamar Bridge]] was completed.  By 2001 it was the 10th longest steel arch bridge, and at that time was just {{convert|20|cm|in|0}} short of having Europe's largest span.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|p=6.}}</ref>

==Consequences==
[[Image:Runcorn Bridge, geograph.jpg|right|thumb|The Silver Jubilee Bridge]]
The bridge transformed Runcorn from an effective [[cul-de-sac]] into a town with through traffic.  Road communications between north Cheshire and south [[Lancashire]] were immediately improved.  Trade at the [[Port of Runcorn]] increased six-fold between 1960 and 1970.  The bridge provides a connection between the [[M56 motorway|M56]] and the [[M62 motorway|M62]].  Its presence enabled the development of the New Town in Runcorn in the late 1960s and the 1970s.  The amount of traffic using the bridge trebled between 1961 and 1970.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=32<U+2013>34.}}</ref>  This led to such severe congestion that in 1975 the bridge was widened and the approach roads were improved.  The carriageway was widened to incorporate the footpaths, giving it four lanes, and a cantilevered footway was built on the east side of the bridge.  This was completed in 1977 and in that year the bridge was re-named from ''Runcorn Bridge'' to the ''Silver Jubilee Bridge'' to commemorate the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen's]] [[silver jubilee]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=35<U+2013>38.}}</ref>  Since 1994 the bridge has been illuminated at night by floodlights.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|pp=41<U+2013>42.}}</ref>  

Traffic on the bridge has continued to grow to over 80,000 vehicles a day, and there is frequent congestion.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/transportandstreets/roadsandfootways/bridges/bridgesppf/?a=5441 |title= Bridges Past, Present and the Future |accessdate= 2008-11-10  |publisher= Halton Borough Council}}</ref>  In order to alleviate this the building of further crossing is planned, known as the [[Mersey Gateway]].  This is planned to be a six-lane toll bridge to the east of the Silver Jubilee Bridge.<ref>{{citation  |url= http://www2.halton.gov.uk/merseygateway/ |title= Mersey Gateway |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |publisher= New Mersey Gateway}}</ref>
