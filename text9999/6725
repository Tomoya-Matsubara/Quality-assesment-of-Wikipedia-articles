'''Tunisia''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: <U+062A><U+0648><U+0646><U+0633>, [[Berber language|Berber]]: [[Image:Tunisia_tifinagh.JPG]]), officially the '''Tunisian Republic''' (<U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0645><U+0647><U+0648><U+0631><U+064A><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062A><U+0648><U+0646><U+0633><U+064A><U+0629>), is a country situated on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[North Africa]]. It is the northernmost African country and the smallest of the nations situated along the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range. Around forty percent of the country is composed of the [[Sahara desert]], with much of the remainder consisting of particularly fertile soil, and a 1300-km coastline. Both played a prominent role in ancient times, first with the famous [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] city of [[Carthage]], and later, as the [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa Province]], which became known as the bread basket of the [[Roman Empire]]. 

It is thought that the name ''[[Tunis]]'' (Arabic for both the nation and capital city) originated from [[Berber languages|Berber]], meaning either a [[geographical]] [[promontory]], or,  "to spend the night."  

==History==
{{main|History of Tunisia}}
[[Image:Tunis_hafsid_flag.png|thumb|left|Tunisian flag under the [[Hafsids]] c.1375]]
[[Image:Medina tower in Sousse, Tunisia.jpg|thumb|Medina tower in Sousse]]
[[Image:Tunis church.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul, Tunis]]

At the beginning of recorded history, Tunisia was inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.  Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the [[10th century BC]]. The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 8th Century B.C. by settlers from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], now in modern day [[Lebanon]]. Legend says that Queen [[Dido]] founded the city, as retold in the Roman Epic [[Aeneid]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from the Phoenicians and [[Canaan|Canaanites]].

After a series of wars with Greece in the [[6th century BC]], Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshiped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]].  Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]] which was altered in Roman times.

Though the Romans referred to the new empire growing in the city of Carthage as [[Punic]] or [[Phoenicia]]n the empire built around Carthage was an independent political entity from the other Phoenician settlements in the Western Mediterranean.

A Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]], one of a series of wars with Rome, nearly crippled the rise of the [[Roman Empire]]. Carthage was eventually conquered by Rome in the [[2nd century BC]], a turning point which led to ancient Mediterranean civilization having been influenced mainly by European instead of African cultures. After the Roman conquest, the region became one of the granaries of Rome. It was conquered by the [[Vandals]] in the [[5th century AD]] and reconquered by the commander [[Belisarius]] in the 6th century during the rule of [[Byzantines|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian]]. 

In the 7th century the region was conquered by [[Arab]] [[Islam|Muslims]], who founded the city of [[Kairouan]]. Successive Muslim dynasties ruled, interrupted by Berber rebellions. The reigns of the [[Aghlabids]] ([[9th century]]) and of the [[Zirids]] (from [[972]]), Berber followers of the [[Fatimids]], were especially prosperous. When the Zirids angered the Fatimids in [[Cairo]] (1050), the latter sent in the [[Banu Hilal]] tribe to ravage Tunisia.

The coasts were held briefly  by the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] in the 12th century. In [[1159]], Tunisia was conquered by the [[Almohad]] caliphs. They were succeeded by the Berber [[Hafsids]] (c.1230<U+2013>1574), under whom Tunisia prospered. In the late 16th Century the coast became a [[pirate]] stronghold (see: [[Barbary States]]). In the last years of the Hafsids, [[Spain]] seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under its [[Turkish People|Turkish]] governors, the [[Beys]], Tunisia attained virtual independence. The Hussein dynasty of Beys, established in 1705, lasted until [[1957]].

===French imperialism===

In the mid-1800's, Tunisia's government under the rule of the Bey severely compromised its legitimacy by making several controversial financial decisions that led to its downfall. [[France]] began plans to take control of Tunisia when the Bey first borrowed large sums of money in an attempt to [[Westernize]]. This failing state facilitated the Algerian raids that occurred thereafter. The weakened Bey was powerless against these raids and unable to resist European colonization.

In 1878, a secret deal was made between the [[United Kingdom]] and France that decided the fate of the [[Africa|African]] country. Provided that the French accepted British control of [[Cyprus]],  recently given to the United Kingdom, the British would in turn accept French control of Tunisia. This satisfied the French and led to their assumption of control in 1880. Tunisia was formally made a French [[protectorate]] on [[May 12]], [[1881]].

===World War II===
''Main article [[Tunisia Campaign]]''

In 1942-1943 Tunisia was the scene of the first major joint operations between the United States and British allies during [[World War II]].  The main body of the British army, advancing from their victory in Battle of [[el-Alamein]] under the command of British [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field Marshal Montgomery]], pushed into Tunisia from the south. The US and other allies, following their invasions of Algeria and Morocco in [[Operation Torch]], invaded from the west.

General [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]], commander of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] forces in North Africa, had hoped to inflict a similar defeat on the allies in Tunisia as German forces had in the [[Battle of France]] in [[1940]].  Before the battle for Tunisia, the inexperienced allied forces had generally been unable to withstand German [[blitzkrieg]]s and properly coordinate their operations. As such the battle for Tunisia was a major test for the allies.  They learned that in order to defeat Germany they would have to coordinate their actions and quickly recover from the inevitable setbacks the experienced German forces would inflict.

On February 19, 1943, General Rommel launched an attack on the American forces in the [[Kasserine Pass]] region of Western Tunisia, hoping to inflict the kind of demoralizing and alliance-shattering defeat the Germans had dealt to Poland and France.  The initial results were a disaster for the United States; the area around the Kasserine Pass is the site of many US [[war grave]]s from that time.  

However, the American forces were ultimately able to reverse their retreat. Having learned a critical lesson in [[tank warfare]], the Allies broke through the German Mareth line on March 20, 1943. The allies subsequently linked up on April 8, 1943. Thus, the United States, United Kingdom, Free French, and Polish (as well as other forces) were able to win a major battle as an allied army. 

The battle, though often overshadowed by Stalingrad, represented a major allied victory of World War II largely because it forged the Alliance which would one day liberate Western Europe.

===Independence===
During Pre colonialism, Tunisia was ruled by a line of Beys until the year 1881.  Up until this point the Beys of Tunisia borrowed money to finance modernization within Tunisia.  This money was borrowed from Europe and when the local population resented tax rises to fund the repayment the country found itself bankrupt.  It is at this stage that the colonial superpowers France, Britain and Italy placed the finances of Tunisia in administration via international agreement.

Initially, Italy was the country that asserted the most desire to have Tunisia as a colony having investment, citizens and geographic proximity as motivation.  However this is rebuffed when Britain and France co-operated to prevent this during the years 1871-1878 ending in Britain supporting French influence in Tunisia for dominion over Cyprus.  France still had the issue of Italian influence and thus decided to find an excuse for a pre-emptive strike.  Using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into Algeria, France marched an army of circa 36,000 personnel which quickly advanced to Tunis and forced the Bey to make terms in the form of the 1881 [[Treaty of Bardo]] (Al Qasr as Sa'id), which gave France control of Tunisian governance and making it a de-facto French protectorate.

Tunisia enjoyed many benefits from the French rule; however, the desire for self governance remained and in 1907 Ali Bach Hamba and Hedi Sfar created the group of young Tunisians which led to the 1920 group called the <U+201C>Destour<U+201D> (constitution) party.  Keeping the new movement under control led the French to use a combination of carrot and stick tactics that worked well but didn<U+2019>t halt the momentum for independence. In 1934, a younger more fervent element of the Destour party called the Neo-Destour emerged, with Habib Bourguiba as their leader, this new party was immediately made illegal by the French administration.

Habib Bourguiba spent a great deal of time in French prisons.  However, this did little to stem his influence of halt the momentum for change.  The Second World War played into Bourguiba<U+2019>s hands as he was moved from Vichy French prisons to Rome, and then to Tunisia as the Axis powers courted his influence in Tunisia.  Bourguiba never endorsed these requests.  He did manage relocation to Tunisia and two months after this, the Allies claimed Tunisia.

In the following ten years, the struggle for independence continued and gained momentum.  Bourguiba was again incarcerated from 1952-1954, which in turn caused an outbreak of terrorist attacks by supporters.  In 1954, things changed abruptly when Pierre Mendes-France became the leader of the French government and pursued a policy of pulling out from burdensome French colonies, with Tunisia in this category. This resulted with the April 1955 agreement which handed internal autonomy to Tunisian hands while international relations were managed by France, a similar situation to the Turkish Bey method of governance in pre-1881.

The Neo-Detour were now in control, but Bourguiba refused to take the helm until the French released all of their control over Tunisia.  He didn<U+2019>t have to wait long, as the terrible Algerian War of Independence changed the French desire for colonialism, leading to the abolition of the Treaty of Bardo and Tunisia gaining full independence in March 20, 1956.

Bourguiba made the step into the role of Prime Minister and after 1957, he became the first president of the Republic of Tunisia as the constitutional role of the Bey was abolished.

==Present-day politics==
{{npov}}
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{morepolitics|country=Tunisia}}
Tunisia is a [[republic]] with a strong [[presidential system]] dominated by a single political party. President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] has been in office since 1987, the year he deposed [[Habib Bourguiba]] in a bloodless coup. The constitution has been changed twice to allow Ben Ali to remain in power: initially from two to three terms, then from three to five. The ruling party, the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally]] (RCD), was the sole legal party for 25 years, known previously as the Socialist Destourian Party (PSD). The RCD still dominates political life.

Facing virtually no opposition, the President is elected to 5-year terms. He appoints a Prime Minister and cabinet, who play a strong role in the execution of policy. Regional governors and local administrators also are appointed by the central government. Largely consultative mayors and municipal councils are elected. There is a [[unicameral]] legislative body, the Chamber of Deputies, which has 182 seats, 20% of which are reserved for the opposition parties. It plays a growing role as an arena for debate on national policy but never originates legislation. The Chamber virtually always passes bills presented by the executive with only one minor change. The judiciary is nominally independent but responds to executive direction, especially in political cases. The military is professional and does not play a role in politics.

Tunisia is noteworthy for its lack of public political discourse.  Tunisia's precise political situation is hard to determine due to a strong level of silence and lack of transparency maintained by the government. There is compelling evidence that dissidents are routinely arrested, for crimes as minor as viewing banned web sites. There are currently six legal opposition parties all with their own newspapers. However, the Committee to Protect Journalists, in its 2005 country report on Tunisia, details a persistent record of harassment, persecution, imprisonment, and physical harm perpetrated on journalists critical of the government.  Even Western journalists, when writing on Tunisian soil, are not spared this fate<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cpj.org/attacks05/mideast05/tunisia_05.html|title=Committee to Protect Journalists 2005 Report on Tunisia|date=2005|publisher=CPJ|accessdate=2006-11-30}}</ref>.

Despite official proclamations, the Tunisian government imposes significant restrictions on freedom of speech and human rights. As such Tunisians are noticeably insecure when discussing political matters. The internet, however, is the most immediately apparent sign of the pervasiveness of state control. In fact the growth of the internet has been a major issue for Tunisia. As tourism (mainly from Europe) has expanded in Tunisia, so has the number of [[Internet Cafe]]s. Tunisian internet access is invariably censored.  This censorship is targeted at material deemed pornographic as well as press or [[chat room]] commentary that is critical of the government. For example, the website of the Al Arabiya [[satellite tv|satellite]] channel is officially censored and thereby inaccessible from any computer in Tunisia.

Nonetheless the government presents itself as Western-friendly. Despite the potential to use their economic weight to impose human rights reforms, the European Union and the United States of America mostly turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in Tunisia. Many Tunisian citizens believe that there is a conspiracy between their government and these superpowers in this matter. The belief is rationalized with the assumption that the Tunisian government has maintained power not from the support of its citizens but by [[patronage]] for safeguarding the economic interests of the many Western corporations with locations in Tunisia.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

Tunisia is also one of the few Muslim countries (Azerbaijan and Turkey are two others), that prohibits the [[hijab]] in government buildings. By government edict, women that insist on wearing the hijab must quit their job or drop out of school. Dissenters are forced to sign a document admitting to having committed a crime punishable by law and, in cases of recidivism, are jailed. Women who insist on keeping their veils despite all threats become the subject of negative propaganda disseminated by the Tunisian authorities on all state and private media.

Underground opposition from Islamic Fundamentalists has an obvious but shadowy existence in Tunisia.  Under former president Bourguiba, Islamic Fundamentalists were allowed to serve as a counterweight to more left-leaning movements. Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, however, has followed an aggressive policy regarding the Fundamentalists, though the extent of government success is difficult to judge in a nation where so much is secret. While Tunisia has a repressive political system, standards of living are among the best in the developing world. Tunisia remains an autocratic regime, but one where starvation, homelessness, and disease, problems seen in much of Africa and Asia, are rare.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

==Geography==

{{main|Geography of Tunisia}}

Tunisia is in northern Africa, between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Sahara Desert]]. It is bordered by [[Algeria]] in the west and [[Libya]] in the south-east. Much of the land is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]]. The north of the country is mountainous, with a climate that is temperate with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers.  The south of the country is dominated by the Sahara desert.

* [[List of cities in Tunisia]]

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Tunisia}}

Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural, mining, energy, tourism, petroleum, and manufacturing sectors. Governmental control of economic affairs, whilst still heavy, has gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization, simplification of the tax structure, and a prudent approach to debt. Real growth averaged 5.0% in the 1990s, and inflation is slowing. Increased trade and tourism have been key elements in this steady economic growth. Tunisia's association agreement with the [[European Union]] (EU), the first such accord between the EU and a Mediterranean country, entered into force on March 1, 1998. Under the agreement Tunisia will gradually remove barriers to trade with the EU over the next decade. Broader privatization, further liberalization of the investment code to increase foreign investment, and improvements in government efficiency are among the challenges for the future of Tunisia. According to the British Philip's universaty atlas of 2000, Tunisia also possessed a major phosphate reserve(s) in the midde section of the country.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Tunisia}}
[[Image:Tabouna (Piotr Kuczynski).jpg|thumb|Traditional Tunisian bread being made]]

While the vast majority of modern Tunisians identify themselves as [[Arab]], most Tunisians descend from indigenous Berbers: less than 20% of the Tunisian genepool comes from the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0410/feature2/online_extra.html|title=DNA study reveals a Phoenician-Maltese link|date=2004-10-01|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> Numerous civilizations have invaded, migrated to, and been assimilated into the population over the millennia. Significant influxes of population have come through conquest by the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Roman Republic|Roman]]s, [[Vandal]]s, Arabs, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s, and [[France|French]]. Many [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Moors]] and [[Jew]]s also arrived at the end of the 15th century. 

Nearly all Tunisians (98% of the population) are Muslim.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ts.html#People |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Tunisia |accessdate=2007-01-13 |format= |work= }}</ref> There has been a Jewish population on the southern island of [[Djerba]] for 2500 years, and though [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|considerably diminished]], there remains a small Jewish population in [[Tunis]] which is descended from those who fled Spain in the late 15th century. There is also a small indigenous [[Christian]] population<ref>{{cite web| url=http://france-echos.com/actualite.php?cle=6174|title=TUNISIE - Ils ont choisi le christianisme|date=2005-07-07|accessdate=2006-09-09|language=French}}</ref>. Small [[Nomadic people|nomadic]] indigenous minorities have been mostly assimilated into the larger population.


==Education==

Prior to 1958 education in Tunisia was only available to a privileged minority (14%). It is now given an extremely high priority and accounts for 6% of G.N.P. A basic education for both boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 16 has been compulsory since 1991. 

While children generally acquire [[Tunisian Arabic]] at home, when they enter school at age 5, they are taught in [[Classical Arabic]]. From the age of 8, they are taught French while English is introduced at the age of 10.
