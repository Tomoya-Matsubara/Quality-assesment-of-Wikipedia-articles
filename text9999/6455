The album was produced mostly by [[Chad Gilbert]], with help from [[Andrew Wade]] and the band's singer, [[Jeremy McKinnon]]. "[[All I Want (A Day to Remember song)|All I Want]]" was released as the first single. It reached number 12 on the U.S. [[Alternative Songs]] chart and number 25 on the [[Rock Songs]] chart.

The album debuted on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 11, and number 1 on several charts: [[Top Hard Rock Albums]], [[Top Independent Albums]], [[Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums]] in the U.S. and the Rock Album Chart in the UK. The band played two songs from the album on the their national TV debut in January 2011, and then went on The Game Changers Tour to help promote the album; shortly afterwards [[What Separates Me from You Tour|touring worldwide]] in support of the release.

When asked about how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see something I like I write it down, so a lot of the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only."<ref name=Rocksoundinterview/> He called ''What Separates Me from You'' "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles.<ref name=Rocksoundinterview/> Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own."<ref name=atp102010/> McKinnon said ''What Separates Me from You'' was "a lot more personal and darker" than ''Homesick'',<ref name=Rocksoundinterview/> and that it was "a natural progression of what we were doing" with "the same core" as the band's preceding albums.<ref name=Rcknvivo>{{cite web|last=Valderrama |first=Cristi<U+00E1>n |url=http://rocknvivo.com/2011/05/25/a-day-to-remember-se-prepara-para-su-gira-suramericana/ |title=A Day to Remember se prepara para su gira suramericana |publisher=Rocknvivo.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2013}} {{Es icon}}</ref> Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it "was definitely the next step" for the band.<ref name=Rcknvivo/> However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [Denney] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff.<ref name=killyourstereo>{{cite web|author=Schatzy |url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/375/a-day-to-remember/ |title=A Day To Remember &#124; Interviews |publisher=Kill Your Stereo |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> Skaff said that McKinnon originally had a different name for the album that "he really wanted, but found it was actually the name of a Terror (hardcore band) album."<ref name=atp032010/>

It was important to the band that "Sticks & Bricks" opened the album, as it was a "in-your-face" song.<ref name=TrackCommentary>{{cite web|author=ADayToRememberVEVO |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSoFKl6jY3A |title=What Separates Me From You Track Commentary |publisher=YouTube |date=October 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> McKinnon said in an interview with [[USAToday]] that the opening lyric ("''I am fueled by all forms of failure''") was "100% directed at everyone who ever doubted our band".<ref name=USAToday/> He stated that it "is one of the meaner, heavier songs that we've ever done as a band."<ref name=shockhound/> "[[All I Want (A Day to Remember song)|All I Want]]" is "about being in a band"<ref name=USAToday/>, according to McKinnon, and was one of the final songs written for the album.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> The song came about from an idea by McKinnon that he expanded on guitar in the middle of recording for the album, and wrote most of it in one night.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> A rough version was recorded between McKinnon and producer [[Chad Gilbert]] before the band had arrived at the studio.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> McKinnon said the song was more of a "singing version" of the band's song "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?".<ref name=TrackCommentary/>

"[[It's Complicated (song)|It's Complicated]]" was written while the band were abroad in Amsterdam; the original version differed significantly from the final version.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> [[Andrew Wade]] flew out to the band in an attempt to work on the song immediately.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> "This Is the House That Doubt Built" was among one of the first to be written for the album, written almost in one sitting while McKinnon had his acoustic guitar with him,<ref name=TrackByTrack>{{cite journal|title=Track By Track|journal=Alternative Press|date=December 14, 2010|page=44}}</ref> while the band was abroad.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> "[[2nd Sucks]]" was about people who viewed being in a band as being a sort of competition.<ref name=TrackCommentary/>

"Better Off This Way" was one of the first written for the album, and re-written "at least 3 different times".<ref name=TrackCommentary/> The song was the final one finished for the album.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> The title for "[[All Signs Point to Lauderdale]]" came from an occasion when McKinnon and bassist Joshua Woodard were in a rough neighborhood in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]].<ref name=TrackCommentary/> A piece of the song came from a recording session for ''Homesick'' when Gilbert said he had an idea for the [[melody]], which McKinnon took a while to write over: "Chad had a cool idea, vocally, for something".<ref name=TrackCommentary/> In an interview with [[PopCrush]] in 2011, McKinnon said the song was when you get the "feeling like you're stuck in a place that's leading you nowhere" and "standing up for yourself and taking charge of your life."<ref name=PopCrush>{{cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/a-day-to-remember-all-signs-point-to-lauderdale/ |title=A Day to Remember Feel <U+2018>Washed Up<U+2019> in <U+2018>All Signs Point to Lauderdale<U+2019> |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" was written with the band's former guitarist, [[Tom Denney]];<ref name=TrackCommentary/> the song was made up of several separate pieces from different song ideas, with a chorus McKinnon had re-written 4 times.<ref name=TrackCommentary/>

Referring to "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic", Skaff said that the song's title had "really came out of nowhere."<ref name=killyourstereo/> McKinnon said the song is a "more personal song [...] It discusses how the choices I've made to put my best foot forward in my career, in a sense, have really done damage to my personal life."<ref name=shockhound/> Both "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" and "Out of Time" talk about "how I feel like I'm doing what I want with my life, but I think, "Wow, I just did something that really affected me.""<ref name=shockhound/> "Out of Time" was also one of the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record.<ref name=TrackCommentary/> Skaff had a major hand in writing "If I Leave".<ref name=TrackCommentary/> The song describes "different things you got through being on the road" and "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person."<ref name=artistdirect>{{cite web|last=Florino |first=Rick |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/a-day-to-remember-talk-what-separates-me-from-you-fan-stories-and-l-a-noire/9205030 |title=A Day to Remember Talk "What Separates Me From You", Fan Stories, and "L.A.

==Reception==
''What Separates Me from You'' received generally favorable reviews. James Christopher Monger of [[Allmusic]] said, "[It] is whiney, petulant, immature, hopeless, and thoroughly addicting, as the ten songs contained within the gatefold packaging [...] are as immaculately crafted and engaging as they are blindingly self-absorbed."<ref name="Allmusic.com">{{cite web|last=Christopher |first=James |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/what-separates-me-from-you-r2034534 |title=What Separates Me from You - A Day to Remember |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}</ref> Brendan Manley from [[Alternative Press]] wrote, "The vitriolic delivery seems sincere, but even if you don<U+2019>t buy into all of the personal/emotional factors underpinning ''Separates'' (smack-talking the smack-talkers/a recent, devastating breakup/assorted perils of touring), the album simply ''kills''."<ref name="altpress.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/a_day_to_remember_-_what_separates_me_from_you/ |title=Alternative Press &#124; Reviews &#124; A Day To Remember - What Separates Me From You |publisher=Altpress.com |date= |accessdate=September 2, 2011}}</ref> However, Christine Caruana of Loud Online said, "[It] is very much typical of its genre.
