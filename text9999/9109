'''Norton Internet Security''', developed by [[Symantec|Symantec Corporation]], provides [[malware]] prevention and removal during a subscription period and uses [[antivirus software#Signature based detection|signatures]] and [[Antivirus software#Heuristics|heuristics]] to identify [[computer virus|viruses]]. Other features include a [[personal firewall|software firewall]], [[e-mail spam]] filtering and [[phishing]] protection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Firewall/Norton-Internet-Security.shtml |title=Norton Internet Security 2009 16.2.0.7 |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work= |publisher=Softpedia |date=February 3rd, 2009 }}</ref> Additional functionalities, such as [[parental controls]], are available as extensions developed by Symantec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/Norton-Add-on-Pack.shtml |title=Norton Add-on Pack 2.1 |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work= |publisher=Softpedia |date=July 14, 2008 }}</ref> 

Symantec distributes the product as a download, a [[Software release life cycle#Box copy|box copy]], or [[Original equipment manufacturer#Computers|OEM software]]. Norton Internet Security and its sister product, [[Norton AntiVirus]], combined, held a 61% [[antivirus]] market share as of 2007. Major competitors in terms of market share include antivirus products from vendors [[CA, Inc.|CA]], [[Trend Micro]], and [[Kaspersky Lab]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crn.com/security/204200883 |title=Channel Best-Sellers: Winning Security Players  |accessdate=2009-03-09 |work=CRN Staff |publisher=United Business Media LLC |date=November 23, 2007}}</ref> 

Norton Internet Security runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]].

CNET found this version had a noticeable toll on system performance, especially when opening files across a network or on a removable disk.<ref name="CNET06"></ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodgearguide.com.au/review/software_and_services/symantec/norton_antivirus_2006/218399 |title=Symantec Norton Antivirus 2006 |work=Matthew Overington | publisher=IDG Communications | date=05/02/2006 |accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> Oli Warner also noted Norton's significant drag when opening or creating files, compared to similar offerings from different vendors.<ref name="Oli"></ref> 

[[Windows 98]] compatibility was dropped from this release. System requirements were [[Windows 2000]] Service Pack 3 or [[Windows XP]], 325 MB ([[Megabyte|Megabytes]]) of free [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] space, a 300 MHz [[Central processing unit|processor]], and 256 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]] is needed.

===Version 2007 (14.0)===
The 2007 version was released on September 12, 2006. 80 percent of the code was rewritten, with the goal of reducing high system resource utilization. New features include a tabbed interface.<ref name="CNET07"/> Symantec extended its [[Veritas Software|Veritas]] VxMS technology, enhancing [[rootkit]] detection. VxMS allows Norton to detect inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level.<ref name="CNET07"/>

[[Phishing]] protection was introduced in this release. Norton checks sites against a blacklist and analyzes its code if the site is not present on a blacklist. Other features include a [[Vulnerability (computing)|exploit]] scanner which looks at system components commonly hosting vulnerabilities, such as Internet Explorer settings. Supplementing the scanner, real-time exploit protection blocks attackers from leveraging common browser and application vulnerabilities. When possible, Norton will fix issues found; otherwise the user is warned of the vulnerability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2023978,00.asp |title=Rad Tech Gifts for Grads&nbsp;<U+2013> Norton Internet Security 2007 - Fresh Phish and Stale Settings&nbsp;<U+2013> Reviews by PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc.|date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login.

==Reception==
===FBI cooperation===

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] confirmed the active development of [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]], a [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] intended to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by [[Bob Sullivan (journalist)|Bob Sullivan]] of [[MSNBC]] on 20 November 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the [[Associated Press]].<ref>Ted Bridis. "FBI Develops Eavesdropping Tools," ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[November 22]], [[2001]].</ref> The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an [[e-mail attachment]]. When the attachment is opened, it installs a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa121401a.htm |title=FBI Has a Magic Lantern |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25471 |title=The FBI's Magic Lantern |publisher=Worldnetdaily.com |date=2001-11-28 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting Magic Lantern. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://utopia.csis.pace.edu/dps/2007/jkile/2005%20-%20Spring/DCS823/Spyware/01016895.pdf |title=Invasive Software: Who's Inside Your Computer? |accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=George Lawton |publisher= |date=July 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The FBI's "Magic Lantern" Shines Bright | url=http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=266 | work= | publisher=Kaspersky Lab | date=11 Dec 2001| accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>

Graham Cluley, a technology consultant from [[Sophos]], said "We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn<U+2019>t know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party".<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=William |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/17572-1.html |title=Antivirus vendors are wary of FBI's Magic Lantern |publisher=1105 Media, Inc. |date=2001-12-06 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, [[chief technical officer]] and cofounder of [[eEye Digital Security]], "Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools."<ref>{{cite web | title=Will security firms detect police spyware? | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-7348-6197020.html?tag=tb | work=Declan McCullagh and Anne Broache | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.| date= July 17, 2007 | accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>

FBI spokesman Paul Bresson, in response if Magic Lantern needed a court order to deploy, "Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.si.umich.edu/~rfrost/courses/SI110/readings/Privacy/Magic_Lantern.pdf |title=FBI Confirms <U+2018>Magic Lantern<U+2019> Project Exists|accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=Elinor Mills Abreu |publisher=At Home Corporation |date=December 31, 2001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v15/15HarvJLTech521.pdf |title=THE CASE FOR MAGIC LANTERN: SEPTEMBER 11 HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR INCREASED SURVEILLANCE  |accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=Christopher Woo & Miranda So |publisher=Harvard Journal of Law & Technology |date=2002}}</ref> Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes.

===Performance impact===

In 2006, Oli Warner published two articles comparing the system performance impact of various Windows applications, including [[Norton Internet Security#Version 2006 (13.0)|Norton Internet Security 2006]]. He later reran the experiments, revising his methodology and included [[Norton Internet Security#Version 2007 (14.0)|2007 version]] at Symantec's request.  
Warner benchmarked the processor and the disk performance with and without each application, compiling two scripts in [[C++]], a [[programming language]]. One calculated all [[Prime number|prime numbers]] between 100,000 and 200,000 and the other tested file read/write time. [[BootVis]] was used to measure boot time. All testing was conducted inside a [[Platform virtualization|virtualized]] environment created by [[VMware]]. Despite the 2007 version's improvements, Warner noted its significant boot delay and impact on file operations.<ref name="Oli">{{cite web |url=http://www.thepcspy.com/read/what_really_slows_windows_down/5 |title=What Really Slows Windows Down|accessdate=2009-03-10 |work=Oli Warner |publisher=Oli Warner |date=September 22, 2006 }}</ref>

Recent testing conducted by PassMark Software found the 2009 version had the least impact on system performance. As noted earlier, Symantec funded the testing and provided some of the scripts used. Warner's scripts were also used to test file read/write time. The second and third ranked suites were [[ESET software#ESET Smart Security|ESET Smart Security 2008]] and [[Kaspersky Internet Security|Kaspersky Internet Security 2009]], respectively.<ref name="Pass">Lai, Karen. Wren, David. (2009). "Antivirus, Internet Security and Total Security Performance Benchmarking Edition 3", PassMark Software Pty Ltd.</ref> Systems were benchmarked with a clean installation of Windows Vista, then again with a security suite installed. The 2009 version had the least impact on boot time, the fastest scan speed, lowest memory utilization, and the program itself installed the fastest out of its competitors. However, the 2009 version had the second most impact on file read/write time, as highlighted by Warner earlier.<ref name="Pass"></ref>

===Uninstallation===

Norton Internet Security (Windows versions) have been criticized for refusing to uninstall completely, leaving unnecessary files behind.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://windowssecrets.com/2008/02/07/01-Symantec-uninstaller-may-not-finish-the-job |title=Symantec uninstaller may not finish the job |accessdate=2009-03-05 |work=Scott Dunn |publisher=WindowsSecrets.com |date=February 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askdavetaylor.com/how_can_i_fully_remove_norton_antivirus_from_my_system.html |title=How can I fully remove Norton Antivirus from my system? |publisher=Dave Taylor |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Versions prior to 2009 installed a separate [[Norton LiveUpdate|LiveUpdate]] program, which updates Norton-branded software. The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton-branded products, if present. In response, Symantec developed the [[Norton Removal Tool]] to remove leftover [[Windows Registry|registry]] keys and values along with files and folders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/tsgeninfo.nsf/docid/2005033108162039 |title=Download and run the Norton Removal Tool |publisher=Symantec Corporation |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> However, uninstallation will not remove subscription data, preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies.

===Windows XP and Vista Service Packs===

When [[Norton Internet Security#Version 2008 (15.0)|Norton Internet Security 2008]] is installed, users encountered incompatibilities upgrading to [[Windows XP Service Pack 3]] or [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1]]. Users report numerous invalid [[registry]] keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters.<ref name="Sym">{{cite web | title=FAQ: Upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1 with your Norton 2008 product installed | url=http://solutions.symantec.com/sdccommon/asp/symcu_defcontent_view.asp?sprt_cid=b32555cd-1b26-4041-abac-882faf8d365f | work= | publisher=Symantec Corporation | date= 8/4/2008 | accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref><ref name="windowssecrets1">{{cite web|author=Patch Watch, May 29, 2008 |url=http://windowssecrets.com/2008/05/29/02-Norton-software-conflicts-with-Windows-XP-SP3 |title=Norton software conflicts with Windows XP SP3 |publisher=Windowssecrets.com |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility.

Dave Cole, Symantec's senior director of product management, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done "extensive testing" of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue hadn't surfaced. Cole essentially blamed Microsoft, "This is related to XP SP3," he stated. Microsoft recommended users to contact Windows customer support.<ref name="Gregg">{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9088598/|title=Symantec pins blame for XP SP3 registry corruption on Microsoft |publisher=Computerworld Inc. |author=Gregg Keizer |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2008-06-19}} </ref> To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading.<ref name="Sym"/> Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect.<ref name="windowssecrets1"/> A tool to remove the added registry entries is also available from Symantec.<ref name="Sym"/>

===Windows Vista===

Sarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's [[Kernel Patch Protection|PatchGuard]] feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]], a part of a [[operating system]] which interacts with the hardware. [[Rootkit|Rootkits]] often hide in a operating system's kernel, complicating removal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ericuday.googlepages.com/EKumar_Rootkits.pdf |title=Battle with the Unseen<U+2013>Understanding Rootkits on Windows|accessdate=2009-03-15 |work=Eric Uday Kumar |publisher=Association of Anti-Virus Asia Researchers |date=2006 }}</ref> Mike Dalton, European president of [[McAfee]] said, "The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, [[Windows Live OneCare]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Vista-PatchGuard-Hacked-37979.shtml |title=Vista PatchGuard Hacked |accessdate=2009-03-11 |work=Marius Oiaga |publisher=Softpedia |date=October 16, 2006}}</ref> Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/05/symantec-virus-microsoft-tech-cx_ll_1006symantec.html |title=Symantec Snaps At Microsoft |accessdate=2009-03-11 |work=Lisa Lerer |publisher=Forbes.com LLC |date=October 10, 2006 }}</ref> Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/Security_Implications_of_Windows_Vista.pdf |title=Security Implications of Windows Vista|accessdate=2009-03-11 |work= |publisher=Symantec Corporation |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Symantec-Vista-White-Paper-Links-to-PatchGuard-Crack/1172700498 |title=Symantec Vista White Paper Links to PatchGuard Crack |accessdate=2009-03-11 |work= Scott M.
