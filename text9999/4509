{{nihongo|'''Mario'''|<U+30DE><U+30EA><U+30AA>|Mario<!-- The Japanese transliteration name "Mario" appears in every game, so leave the Japanese transliteration as "Mario". -->}} is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] in [[Mario (series)|his eponymous video game series]], created by Japanese [[Game designer#Video game designer|video game designer]] [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Serving as [[Nintendo]]'s mascot and the main [[protagonist]] of the series, Mario has appeared in [[List of Mario games by year|over 200 video games]] since his creation. Though originally only appearing in [[platform game]]s, starting with ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', Mario currently appears in varied video game genres such as [[Mario Kart|racing]], [[List of Mario games by genre#Puzzle series|puzzle]], [[Mario role-playing games|role-playing]], [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|fighting]], and [[List of Mario games by genre#Sports series|sports]].

Mario is depicted as a short, pudgy, [[Italian American|Italian-American]] [[plumber]] who lives in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. He repeatedly stops the turtle-like villain [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]'s numerous plans to kidnap [[Princess Peach]] and subjugate the Mushroom Kingdom. He also has other enemies and rivals, including [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] and [[Wario]]. Since 1995, Mario has been voiced by [[Charles Martinet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=164|title=Charles Martinet Down Under|publisher=N-Sider|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref>

As Nintendo's mascot, Mario is arguably the most famous character in video game history,<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-nintendo_shining_star.htm|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> and his image is commonly associated with video games.

Outside [[platform game]]s, he has appeared in video games of other genres, including the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' racing series, sports games, such as the ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' and ''[[Mario Golf]]'' series, and [[Console role-playing game|role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Paper Mario]]'' and ''Super Mario RPG''. He has also inspired television shows, film, comics, and a line of licensed merchandise.

== Concept and creation ==
[[File:Mario emblem.svg|150px|thumb|left|Seen on his hat, Mario's emblem represents him in the interfaces of many of the games he has appeared in.]]
Mario was created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] in his attempts to produce a best-selling video game for [[Nintendo]], after previous titles, such as ''[[Sheriff (arcade game)|Sheriff]]'', had not achieved the same success as other titles such as ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Originally, Miyamoto wanted to create a video game that used the characters [[Popeye]], [[Bluto]], and [[Olive Oyl]].<ref name="n-sider" /> At the time, however, Miyamoto was unable to acquire a license to use the characters (and would not until [[Popeye (video game)|1982]]), and ended up making Jumpman (later known as Mario), [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], and [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]].<ref name="n-sider" /> In the early stages of the game, Mario was unable to jump, and the focus was to escape a maze. However, Miyamoto added in that ability, saying "If you had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?".<ref name="wired">{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=18|title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming|publisher=[[Wired News]]|author=Orlando, Greg|accessdate=2008-08-23|date=2007-05-15}}</ref><ref name="wii-com1">{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page1.jsp |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros. |work=Wii.com |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2009-11-27 |page=1}}</ref>

Mario's name was originally "Mr. Video", and he was to be used in every video game Miyamoto developed.<ref name="yahoo" /> This idea was inspired by [[manga]] artists such as [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Fujio Akatsuka]], who feature [[Osamu Tezuka's Star System|several characters across multiple manga]], as well as British director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who appears in most of his own films. During localization of the game for American audiences, Nintendo of America's warehouse landlord [[Mario Segale]] confronted its then-president [[Minoru Arakawa]], demanding back rent. Following a heated argument in which the Nintendo employees eventually convinced Segale he would be paid, they opted to name the character in the game Mario after him.<ref>{{cite book |title=Out of Left Field: How the Mariners Made Baseball Fly in Seattle |last=Thiel |first=Art |year=2003 |publisher=Sasquatch Books |isbn=1570613907 |pages=44<U+2013>45 }}</ref> Miyamoto had commented that if he had named him Mr. Video, he likely would have "disappeared off the face of the Earth".<ref name="wii-com1"/> By Miyamoto's own account, Mario's profession was chosen to fit with the game design. Since the game was set on a construction site, Mario was made into a carpenter. When he appeared again in ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', it was decided he should be a plumber, since a lot of the game is played in underground settings.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/11/qa-mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto/1|title=Q&A: 'Mario' creator Shigeru Miyamoto|date=Nov 08, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-09|author=Mike Snider|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> Mario's character design, particularly his large nose, draws on western influences; once he became a plumber, Miyamoto decided to "put him in [[New York City|New York]]" and make him Italian,<ref name="usatoday" /> lightheartedly attributing Mario's nationality to his mustache.<ref name="IGN Miyamoto Interview">{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=Q&A: 90 Minutes With Miyamoto, Nintendo<U+2019>s Master of Amusement |url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/06/interview-90-mi|url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/06/interview-90-mi/#previouspost|publisher=IGN.com|accessdate=July 30 2010}}</ref> Other sources have Mario's profession chosen to be carpenter in an effort to depict the character as an ordinary hard worker, and make it easier for players to identify with the him;<ref name="mariomania">[[Minoru Arakawa|Arakawa, Minoru]] (1991).

Due to the graphical limitations of arcade hardware at the time, Miyamoto clothed the character in bright red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against each other and the background. A cap was added to let Miyamoto avoid drawing the character's hairstyle, forehead, and eyebrows, as well as to circumvent the issue of animating his hair as he jumped.<ref name="n-sider">{{cite web|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/833/833615p1.html|title=IGN Presents the History of Super Mario Bros.|author=McLaughlin, Rus|date=2007-08-11|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref><ref name="usatoday" /> To make him appear human onscreen despite his small size, Mario was given distinct features, prominently a large nose and a mustache, which avoided the need to draw a mouth and facial expressions on the small onscreen character.<ref name="CNN">Rao, Anjali (2007-02-15).

Miyamoto developed Mario with the idea of using him as a "go to" character that could be put in any title as needed, albeit in cameo appearances as at the time he was not expecting Mario to become popular.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/events/playback/playback-93/1378336|title=Playback 93|date=2009-12-02|publisher=Yahoo|accessdate=2009-12-24}}</ref> To this end he originally called the character "Mr. Video", comparing his intent to have Mario appear in later games to the cameos done by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] within his films.<ref name="wii-com2">{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page2.jsp |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros. |work=Wii.com |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2009-11-27 |page=2}}</ref> Over time, Mario's appearance has become more defined; both a red "M" in a white circle on the front of his hat and gold buttons on his overalls have been added. Miyamoto attributed this process to the different development teams and artists for each game as well as advances in technology as time has gone on.<ref name="mariomania" /> Nintendo has never revealed Mario's full name, stating only that it was not "Mario Mario" despite the implication of the ''Mario Bros.'' series' title, its use in the [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|film]], and information given in the [[Prima Games|Prima]] official Guidebook to ''[[Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Inside Super Mario Bros |series=[[Inside Edition]] |credits=Reporter: Joel Loy |network=[[CBS Television Distribution]] |airdate=1989}}</ref>

Wario's motive behind this sudden attack was to take control over Mario's castle in order to have a palace of his own. To stop Wario, Mario finds the 6 Golden Coins throughout Mario Land and regains access to his castle. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', a [[stork]] carries Baby Mario and Baby Luigi across the sea, but the evil [[Magikoopa]] [[Kamek]] emerges and steals Baby Luigi, and Baby Mario falls onto an island in the middle of the sea called Yoshi's Island, home to Yoshis.

The Nintendo Comics System series, along with the [[Nintendo Adventure Books]], were also created.

== Characteristics ==

Mario was originally portrayed as a two-dimensional [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]], but in later games he is shown as a three-dimensional, [[polygonal modeling|polygonal model]]. He is depicted as a portly plumber<ref name="mariobioign"/> who lives in the fictional land of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]<ref name="n-sider" /> with [[Luigi]], his younger, taller brother, who is also a plumber.<ref name="luigibioign">{{cite web| title = Luigi Biography| publisher = IGN| url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924288_biography.html| accessdate = January 26, 2010}}</ref> In the television series and film, Mario and Luigi are originally from [[Brooklyn]], New York.<ref name="mariobioign"/> Little is known of Mario's childhood, though the infant version of Mario, Baby Mario, first appeared in 1995 in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', and has often appeared in Nintendo sports games since that time. Baby Mario has a major role along with [[Luigi|Baby Luigi]] in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and also appears in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]''. He (along with the adult Mario) is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Martinet: Voice Over|url=http://www.charlesmartinet.com/voiceover.html|accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref>

=== Occupation and hobbies ===
Mario's occupation is plumbing, though in the original ''[[Donkey Kong (series)|Donkey Kong]]'' games he is a carpenter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/service/corporate_2001.html|title=Nintendo - Corporate: About Nintendo Worldwide|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2007|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> Mario has also had several other occupations: in the ''[[Dr. Mario (video game)|Dr. Mario]]'' series of [[puzzle video game|puzzle games]], which debuted in 1990,<ref name="drmario" /> Mario is portrayed as a medical physician named "Dr. Mario";<ref>{{cite web| title = Top Ten Mario Games| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = July 24, 2007| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/top-ten-screwattack/22754| accessdate = January 30, 2010}}</ref> in the [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Mario's Picross]]'', Mario is an [[archaeology|archaeologist]]; and in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'', Mario is the president of a profitable toy-making company.<ref>{{cite manual| title = Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis Instruction Booklet| section = Story and Characters| publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]| date = 1990-09-25}}</ref> Mario usually saves [[Princess Peach]] and the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and purges antagonists, such as [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], from various areas. Mario has gained fame in the Mushroom Kingdom due to his heroic deeds, as shown in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', where the brothers are referred to as "superstars".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marioandluigi.gameboy.com/flash.jsp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021031417/http://marioandluigi.gameboy.com/flash.jsp|archivedate=2007-10-21|title=Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga|publisher=[[Nintendo]]}}</ref>

=== Relationships ===
Since his first game, Mario has usually had the role of saving the [[damsel in distress]].<ref name="mariobioign">{{cite web| title = Mario Biography| publisher = IGN| url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/923/923448_biography.html| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}</ref> Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend [[Recurring characters in the Mario series#Pauline|Pauline]] in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' from Donkey Kong.<ref name="dkhist" /> Pauline was soon replaced by a new damsel in distress, [[Princess Peach]], in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''<ref name="n-sider" /> Pauline returned in the [[Game Boy]] remake of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' in 1994, and later in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'' in 2006, although the character is now described as "Mario's friend".<ref name="Mario vs. DK 2">{{cite web|url=http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ds/previews/mario-vs--donkey-kong-2--march-of-the-minis-902997.html|title=Mario vs. DK 2: March of the Minis|publisher=[[Yahoo! Games]]|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> Mario has rescued Princess Peach multiple times since ''Super Mario Bros.''<ref name="mariobioign" /> In a [[role reversal]], Peach rescues Mario in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]''.<ref>{{cite web| last = Bozon| first = Mark | title = Hands-On: Super Princess Peach| publisher = IGN| date = February 1, 2006| url = http://ds.ign.com/articles/685/685051p1.html| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}</ref> Mario rescued [[Princess_Daisy_(Mario)|Princess Daisy]] of Sarasaraland in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title = Princess Daisy Biography| publisher = IGN| url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/963/963167_biography.html| accessdate = January 27, 2009}}</ref> but Luigi seems to be romantically involved with her. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', the text explaining Daisy's trophy states that "after her appearance in ''[[Mario Golf]]'', gossips portrayed her as Luigi's answer to Mario's Peach",<ref>{{cite video game|title=Super Smash Bros. Melee|developer=HAL Laboratory|publisher=Nintendo|date=2001-12-03|platform=Nintendo GameCube}}</ref> and statues of both appeared (in adult and infant forms) in the Daisy Circuit in [[Mario Kart Wii]], confirming their relationship.

[[Luigi]] is Mario's younger brother.<ref name="luigibioign" /> He is a companion in the ''Mario'' games<ref name="luigibioign" /> and the character whom the second player controls in two-player sessions of many of the video games,<ref name="luigiprofileign">{{cite web| title = Luigi Profile| publisher = IGN| url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924288.html| accessdate = January 26, 2010}}</ref> though he also occasionally rescues Mario, as seen in ''[[Mario is Missing!]]'' and ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]''.<ref>{{cite web| last = Buchanan| first = Levi| title = The Other Mario Games, Vol. 2| publisher = IGN| date = August 7, 2008| url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/897/897225p1.html| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' for the Game Boy saw the arrival of [[Wario]], Mario's greedy [[wikt:counterpart|counterpart]], who is often Mario's antagonist or an [[antihero]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Wario Biography| publisher = IGN| url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924285_biography.html| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}</ref> [[Yoshi]] is presumed to be a dinosaur, though his species is named Yoshi.<ref name="yoshibio" /> They vary in color, but the original Yoshi is green.<ref name="yoshibio">{{cite web| title =Yoshi Biography | url =http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924294_biography.html | publisher = IGN| accessdate =January 23, 2009 }}</ref> Yoshi serves as Mario's mount in games such as [[Super Mario World]],<ref name="yoshibio" /> and is depicted as a more sentient creature in games like [[Super Mario Kart]] and [[Yoshi's Island]].

== Abilities ==
During the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', Mario was known as '''Jumpman'''.<ref name="n-sider" /> Jumping<U+2014>both to access places and as an offensive move<U+2014>is a common gameplay element in ''Mario'' games, especially the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' series. By the time ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'' was released, jumping became such a signature act of Mario that the player was often tasked with jumping to prove to NPCs that he was Mario.  Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes also causing secondary effects.<ref name="n-sider" /> This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like [[Enemies in the Mario series#Koopa Troopa|Koopa Troopas]] into or out of their shells, which can be used as weapons.<ref name="n-sider" /> Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him. Later, the Game Boy version of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' allowed Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps, and perform a back-flip. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario gains new jumping abilities, such as a sideways somersault, a ground pound, and the "Wall Kick", which propels him upwards by kicking off walls.

[[File:Tanooki Mario.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Mario seen wearing the Tanooki Suit. The suit originated as a result of the developers being unable to implement the character [[Yoshi]] into ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', and is derived from the mythical creature [[Tanuki]].]]

=== Power-ups ===
Mario uses items, which give him various powers. The first power-up Mario uses is the Hammer in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref name="dkhist">{{cite web| last = Trueman| first = Doug| title = GameSpot Presents: The History of Donkey Kong| publisher = [[Gamespot]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/dk_history/p03.html| accessdate = January 1, 2010}}</ref>
''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' introduced the basic three power-ups that have become staples for the series, especially the 2D games <U+2014>- the Super Mushroom, which causes Mario to grow larger; the Fire Flower, which allows Mario to throw fireballs; and the Starman, which gives Mario temporary invincibility. These powers have appeared regularly throughout the series.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.games.ign.com/articles/833/833615p1.html |title=IGN: IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros |publisher=Uk.games.ign.com |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> Throughout the series' history, there have been several kinds of Mushroom power-ups, including the [[1-Up]] Mushroom, which gives Mario an extra life; the Poison Mushroom, which causes Mario to either shrink or die;<ref>{{cite web|last=Suellentrop |first=Chris |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2177082/ |title=Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels reviewed. - By Chris Suellentrop - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> the Mega Mushroom, which causes Mario to grow very large; and the Mini Mushroom, which causes Mario to shrink.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Craig |url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/705/705537p2.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

A common power-up throughout the series is an item that gives Mario the ability of flight. The first of this type was introduced in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and called the Super Leaf; it gives Mario a raccoon suit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Provo |first=Frank |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermariobros3/review.html |title=Super Mario Bros. 3 Review for Wii - GameSpot |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> Also in this game is the [[Tanuki]] suit, which allows flight and the ability to turn into a statue.<ref name="ignsuits">{{cite web| title = Top 10 Mario Suits| publisher = IGN| date = November 16, 2009| url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/104/1045630p1.html| accessdate = January 23, 2010}}</ref> Later, in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', an item called the Cape Feather was introduced that gave Mario a cape.<ref>{{cite web|last=Navarro |first=Alex |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/action/supermarioworldsnes/review.html |title=Super Mario World Review for Wii - GameSpot |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=2007-02-09 |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> In ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'', a carrot was available that gave Mario rabbit ears that allowed him to fly,<ref name="ignsuits" /> and in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario could acquire an item called the Wing Cap, which temporarily gave him the ability of flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/wii/virtualconsole/games/detail/48czfMMYIp_0_alQYMIOS7sgrvUdDq1O |title=Super Mario 64 at Nintendo :: Wii :: Virtual Console :: Games |publisher=Nintendo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ''Super Mario Sunshine'' introduces a pump-water spraying device named "F.L.U.D.D.", which has the ability to spray water, hover and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/supermariosunshine/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review |title=Super Mario Sunshine Review for GameCube - GameSpot |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=2002-10-04 |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> [[Super Mario Galaxy]] also introduced new power-ups, including the Bee Mushroom, which naturally turned Mario into a bee and allowed him to fly temporarily; the Ghost Mushroom, which turned Mario into a ghost, allowing him to float and pass through walls; and the Spring Mushroom, which encased Mario in a spring, allowing him to jump higher.<ref>{{cite manual| title = Super Mario Galaxy Instruction Booklet| section = Mario's Special Moves | publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]| date = 2007}}</ref> [[Super Mario Galaxy 2]] introduced even more power ups alongside those introduced in Super Mario Galaxy including the Cloud Flower which turns Mario into Cloud Mario and allows him to create cloud platforms with a spin jump; the Rock Mushroom which turns him into a boulder and even some power ups for Yoshi.<ref>{{cite manual| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Instruction Booklet| section = Mario's Special Moves | publisher = [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]| date = 2010}}</ref>  [[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]] introduced the propeller mushroom, which clothed the player in a propeller suit, allowing him to fly, and the penguin suit, which makes it easier for the wearer to traverse ice and swim through water, and also allowed the wearer to fire ice balls, which freeze enemies in place.  The game also has an ice flower, which gives the player the ability to shoot ice balls, but does not help with ice or water environments.  [[Super Mario Galaxy]] had an ice flower, but this allowed the player to temporarily walk on water and lava without sinking or taking damage, by placing ice platforms wherever the player stood.

The animated series ''[[The Super Mario Bros.

Mario appeared in a book series, the [[Nintendo Adventure Books]].
