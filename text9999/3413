{{nihongo|'''Prince Yamashina Kikumaro''' |<U+5C71><U+968E><U+5BAE> <U+83CA><U+9EBF><U+738B>|Yamashina-no-miya Kikumaro-<U+014D>|extra=  3 July 1873 &ndash; 2 May 1908}}, was the second head of the [[Yamashina-no-miya]], a [[oke|collateral line]] of the [[Imperial Household of Japan|Japanese imperial family]].

==Early life==
Prince Yamashina Kikumaro was the son of [[Prince Yamashina Akira]]. His mother was a [[concubine]], Nakajo Chieko, but as Prince Akira had no children by his official wife, Princess [[Katsura Sumiko]] (the half-sister of [[Emperor K<U+014D>mei]]), Kikumaro was adopted as his official heir.

However, in 1880, he was adopted by [[Prince Nashimoto Moriosa]] to carry on the [[Nashimoto-no-miya|Nashimoto line]]. However, following Prince Moriosa<U+2019>s death, the Nashimoto line passed to [[Prince Nashimoto Morimasa|Prince Kuni Morimasa]], and Prince Kikumaro was able to return as heir to the Yamashina line. On  2 February 1898, he succeeded his father as the second head of the Yamashina-no-miya house.

==Military career==
Prince Yamashina Kikumaro attended the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] and received a commission as a sub-lieutenant in 1894. He served his [[midshipman]] duties on the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Iwate||2}}, followed by a tour of duty aboard the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Yakumo||2}} from 1902. He served in combat with distinction during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, and was awarded the [[Order of the Golden Kite]] (4th class). By 1905, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He entered the [[Naval War College (Japan)|Naval Staff College]] in January 1908, but died suddenly four months later at the young age of 35.

==Marriage & Family==
On  14 September 1895, Prince Yamashina Kikumaro married '''Kujo Noriko''' ( 4 December 1878 <U+2013>  11 November 1901), a daughter of Prince [[Kujo Michitaka]]. Prince and Princess Yamashina had two sons and a daughter:

# [[Prince Yamashina Takehiko]] ( 13 February 1899 &ndash; 10 August 1987)
# Marquis [[Yamashina Yoshimaro]] ( 5 July 1900 <U+2013>  29 January 1989)
# Princess Yamashina Yasuko ( 31 October 1901<U+3000><U+FF0D><U+3000> 29 December 1974)

On  2 February 1902, the widowed Prince Yamashina married '''Shimazu Hisako''' ( 7 February 1874 <U+2013>  26 February 1938), daughter of Prince [[Shimazu Tadayoshi]]. Prince Yamashina and his second wife had three sons:

# Marquis [[Fujimaro Tsukuba]] (b.  7 February 1905 <U+2013>  20 March 1978)
# Count [[Hagimaro Kashima]] ( 21 April 1906 <U+2013>  26 August 1932)
# Count [[Shigemaro Katsuragi]] ( 29 April 1908 <U+2013>  10 January 1947)
