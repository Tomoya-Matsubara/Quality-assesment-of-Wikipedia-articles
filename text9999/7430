She is a 14-year-old purple [[anthropomorphism|anthropmorphic]] cat and has a withdrawn, reticent, and cold personality. She is notable for her [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] abilities, for which she is named. Blaze comes from an alternate dimension and is the guardian of the Sol Emeralds, her dimension's version of the series' integral [[Chaos Emeralds]].

Blaze's first appearance arrived in the 2005 [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Sonic Rush]]'', where<U+2014>as a playable protagonist alongside [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]<U+2014>she collects the Sol Emeralds after losing them upon entering his dimension. Shortly afterward, she appeared as [[Silver the Hedgehog]]'s friend from the future in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' (2006), and she has since been a playable and non-playable character in numerous ''Sonic'' games. She has also made appearances in [[Archie Comics]]' ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' comic book series. Game critics' opinions on Blaze have been mixed, focusing mainly on her similarities to Sonic and her powerful abilities.

Blaze comes from a world outside the main ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series. While there, she is a [[princess]] and the guardian of the Sol Emeralds, a group of powerful elemental gemstones analogous to the series' integral [[Chaos Emeralds]]. Her personality is calm, [[extraversion and introversion|introverted]], and stoic, although this sometimes conceals a greater level of emotion. She is highly disciplined and focused on her job as the Sol Emeralds' guardian, and frequently suffers from this high degree of self-pressure.<ref name="rush 5">''[[Sonic Rush]]'' instruction manual, p. 5.</ref><ref name="gens"/> She also has difficulty making friends and, when she does, frequently rejects their offers to help her.<ref name="gens">{{cite video game|title=Sonic Generations|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|date=November 1, 2011|quote='''Description:''' Blaze is a princess from another dimension who is the protector of the Sol Emeralds.

Blaze is a recurring character in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' comic book series published by [[Archie Comics]]. She suffers frequent dreams about a blue hedgehog and arrives in Sonic's world, known in the comics as Mobius, to seek him out. However, she is captured, knocked unconscious, and imprisoned by Eggman's robots; she wakes up and destroys them and part of the facility while Sonic simultaneously arrives to rescue her.<ref>{{cite comic|story = Birthday Bash - Part One: Giving and Receiving|title = [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]|issue = 160|date = March 2006 |publisher = [[Archie Comics]]}}</ref> Blaze attacks him, but he whips up air currents around her and she almost suffocates until he saves her from them.

Blaze re-enters the comics' main arc when she returns to Mobius to look for more Sol Emeralds. She finds Amy and Cream and fights them, thinking they have found one and are keeping it from her, but apologizes when it turns out to be a broken glass bottle. Amy and Cream sense her need for help and go with her as she searches for Emeralds. [[Rouge the Bat]] arrives and assists them by flying Blaze down into a ravine and defending the three from a giant falling tree branch, but when they all reach the Emerald, Rouge steals it for herself. [[E-123 Omega]] and Shadow show up to defend Rouge; in a resultant scuffle, the Emerald changes hands a few times before being stolen by [[Nack the Weasel]].
