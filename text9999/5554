==Biography==
===Early years===
Glasgow was born in [[Wheeling, Missouri]], in 1907.<ref>{{cite news|title=Glasgow Seeks Co. Attorney Post|newspaper=Cedar Rapids Tribune|date=1954-03-04}}</ref>  He was the son of Franklin and Nellie (Williams) Glasgow and lived on a farm west of Wheeling for the first ten years of his life.<ref name=Wheeling>{{cite news|title=Former Wheeling Boy to Pilot the Iowa Grid Team: Willis Glasgow, Now  Residing at Shcnandoah, Ia., Named Captain of the University Football Squad|newspaper=Constitution Tribune (Chillicothe, Missouri)|date=1928-12-17}} (blockquote reprinted from The Des Moines Register)</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William John Petersen|title=The story of Iowa: the progress of an American state, Volume 3|year=1952}}</ref>  He moved with his family to [[Shenandoah, Iowa]], in 1916 and attended Shenandoah High School where he was selected as Iowa's all-state [[quarterback]] as a sophomore in 1922.<ref name=HOF/><ref name=Seeks/>  He was the captain of Shenandoah's 1923 football team.<ref>{{cite news|title=SHENANDOAH PREPARES FOR GOOD GRID SEASON|newspaper=Waterloo Evening Courier|date=1923-09-05}}</ref>

===College athlete===
====Nebraska====
Glasgow enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska<U+2013>Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] in 1925.<ref name=HOF/>  As a freshman at Nebraska, Glasgow saw that the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Cornhuskers]] were emphasizing "beef and brawn" over "speed and agility."<ref name=HOF/>  At 5 feet, 8 inches, and 175 pounds, Glasgow concluded he would see more playing time elsewhere and transferred to the [[University of Iowa]].

====Iowa====
After sitting out the 1926 season following his transfer, Glasgow played three years each for [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa's football]] and baseball teams.  As a baseball player, he played [[shortstop]] and won three [[varsity letter]]s.  He was the starting shortstop and leading hitter of the 1927 Iowa baseball team that tied for the [[Big Ten Conference]] championship.<ref name=Captain/>  He gained his greatest acclaim playing at the [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] position for Iowa's football team from 1927 to 1929. Glasgow was the football team's leading ground gainer three straight years, a record that has not been equaled.<ref name=HOF/>  In addition to his talent as a runner, Glasgow was also known as "a deadly tackler while operating at [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] in the old diamond defense."<ref name=HOF/>  He also handled [[Punter (football)|punting]] and [[Placekicker|place kicking]] responsibilities for the Hawkeyes.  Iowa coach [[Burt Ingwersen]] later said of Glasgow:<blockquote>"I think Bill's greatest attribute as a ball carrier was the fact that you could never run him out of bounds.  When tacklers would corner him against the [[sidelines]], he'd cut back, put his head down and let them have it. I'll never forget one game at Minnesota. He ran into a tackler so hard the poor Minnesota fellow got up and lined up in our [[backfield]] on the next play."<ref name=HOF/></blockquote>

=====1927=====
As a sophomore in 1927, Glasgow ran for three [[touchdown]]s and kicked two [[extra point]]s in the second quarter of his first football game for the Hawkeyes, a 32&ndash;6 win over [[Monmouth College]].  His 20-point total in the second quarter against Monmouth remains an Iowa Hawkeyes record for scoring in a single quarter.<ref name=HOF/><ref>{{cite book|author=Mike Finn|title=Iowa Legends, Lists and Lore|page=46}}</ref>

=====1928=====
As a junior in 1928, Glasgow helped lead Iowa to six straight victories, including a 14&ndash;7 win over [[1928 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in which Glasgow ran for 153 yards.<ref name=HOF/>  The 1928 team lost the Big Ten Conference championship after a 10&ndash;7 loss to [[1928 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], a game in which Iowa's only touchdown came on a 55-yard run by Glasgow.<ref name=HOF/>  Glasgow also gained acclaim in 1928 for his punting performance in Iowa's 7&ndash;6 win over a [[1928 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]] team featuring [[Bronko Nagurski]].  Glasgow's punting helped keep Minnesota from scoring in the first three quarters.  In the fourth quarter, a long punt by Glasgow sailed high over the head of Minnesota's [[Frederick L. Hovde|Fred Hovde]], but Hovde ran back to the nine-yard line where he retrieved the punt and ran for a 91-yard touchdown.  Glasgow was injured trying to catch Hovde.<ref name=HOF/>  At the end of the 1928 season, Glasgow was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten and All-Western player.<ref name=HOF/><ref>{{cite news|title=One Hawkeye Lands Place on Honor 11: Hawkeye's Captain for Next Year Is Placed on Mythical Team; Willis Glasgow on First Eleven and Three More on Second Lineup|newspaper=Davenport Democrat And Leader|date=1928-12-05}} (Glasgow selected on Associated Press first-team All-Western team)</ref>  He placed fourth in the voting for the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football]] trophy as the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference in 1928 and was elected by his teammates as the captain of the 1929 Iowa Hawkeyes football team.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bennett Awarded Valuable Player Trophy by Tribune|newspaper=Daily Illini|date=1929-01-26|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/dnc/Default/Skins/UIUC/Client.asp?Skin=UIUC&AppName=2&enter=true&BaseHref=DIL/1929/01/06&EntityId=Ar00817}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New Hawkeye Captain Also Diamond Star|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1928-12-05|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/453974812.html?dids=453974812:453974812&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+05,+1928&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=New+Hawkeye+Captain+Also+Diamond+Star&pqatl=google}}</ref>  In reporting on his election as Iowa's 1929 captain, one Iowa newspaper described his as the team's "Dancing Master": "Glasgow is commonly known as Iowa's Dancing master because of his shiftiness on the gridiron and because he is manager of the most popular ball room in Iowa City."<ref name=Captain>{{cite news|author=Leo H. Peterson|title=Willis Glasgow Elected Captain of Hawkeye Eleven for 1929 Season|newspaper=Davenport Democrat And Leader|date=1928-12-05}}</ref>  At the end of the 1928 season, ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'' wrote:<blockquote>"The new leader is something more than a [[triple threat man]]. His off-tackle dashes and ability in an open field are supplemented by his accomplishments as a place kicker, punter, and forward passer. Weighing only 160 pounds, Glasgow's 5 feet 9 inches of height ranked him as one of the shortest men on the squad. He was apparently immune to injury, and despite the fact that he was the target of every defense the Hawkeyes encountered, he almost never called for time out."<ref name=Wheeling/></blockquote>

=====1929=====
As a senior in 1929, Glasgow gained further acclaim as the captain of a football team that permitted its opponents to score only 28 points all season.  Despite the low-scoring by opponents, the Hawkeyes finished with a record of 4&ndash;2&ndash;2.  On October 5, 1929, Glasgow scored the first touchdown in Iowa's new football stadium, now known as [[Kinnick Stadium]], on a 31-yard run.<ref>Hawkeye Legends, Lists and Lore, p. 50.</ref>  He also scored the first touchdown in the official dedication game against the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|University of Illinois]].  In the Illinois game, Glasgow ran for a 78-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage.<ref name=HOF>{{cite news|author=Buck Turnbull|title=GRID STAR FOR HAWKEYES IN LATE '20s: Glasgow Added to 'Hall'|newspaper=The Des Moines Register|date=1973-04-01}}("The stadium's official dedication ceremonies were saved until the homecoming game against Illinois in mid-October. On the first play from scrimmage, there went Glasgow again <U+2014> 78 yards to a touchdown!")</ref>  The touchdown was Iowa's only score in a 7&ndash;7 tie game against Illinois.  Glasgow wore a protective face mask in the 1929 Illinois game (''pictured above'') to protect a broken cheek bone suffered in an earlier game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mask Protects Iowa Grid Ace|newspaper=Montana Standard|date=1929-10-27}}</ref>   Glasgow also kicked a game-winning field goal in Iowa's 9&ndash;7 win over [[1929 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]] on November 9, 1929.<ref name=Obit/> 

The Iowa football program became embroiled in scandal late in the 1929 season.  After an investigation revealed a slush fund used to pay football players, Iowa was banned from the Big Ten Conference. Following a 7&ndash;0 loss to [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]], sports writer Irving Vaughn praised Glasgow in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'':<blockquote>"If Iowa needs any consolation for its failure to create more havoc in the Big Ten circle from which it is to be banished, it can find it quite easily. Hawkeyes have Capt. Bill Glasgow.  No halfback ever revealed himself in a brighter light.  He ran off the tackles, he ripped into the line and he passed. He literally carried almost the entire Purdue team with him at times.  When tougher and more willing backs are built, they will have to make the model from the stocky lad from Shenandoah, Iowa."<ref>{{cite news|author=Irving Vaughn|title=PURDUE TRIMS IOWA, 7-0, TO CLINCH TITLE|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1929-11-17|page=A1|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/480527992.html?dids=480527992:480527992&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+17,+1929&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=PURDUE+TRIMS+IOWA,+7-0,+TO+CLINCH+TITLE&pqatl=google}}</ref></blockquote>

At the conclusion of the [[1929 college football season]], Glasgow was selected as a first-team [[1929 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by [[Grantland Rice]] for ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Nagurski Gets Post On Rice<U+2019>s All-American: Minnesota Star Placed At Tackle on All-Star Aggregation; Glasgow and Welch Other Big Ten Aces|publisher=The Evening Tribune (Albert Lea, MN)|date=1929-12-20}}</ref> the Newspaper Editors Association (based on a poll of 100 coaches and football writers),<ref>{{cite news|author=William Braucher (NEA Service Sports Writer)|title=NEA Names Three Big 10 Stars on All-American: Place Carideo of Notre Dame at Quarterback|publisher=Sheboygan Journal|date=1929-12-06}}</ref> ''[[The New York Sun]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Bear Schwartz on One All-American|publisher=Montana Standard|date=1929-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sleight Picked for All-America: Purdue Tackle Placed On New York Sun's Mythical Team; Welch On Second Eleven|publisher=Kokomo Tribune|date=1929-11-30}}</ref> and sports writer Lawrence Perry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lawrence Perry's 1929 All-American|publisher=Evening Huronite|date=1929-12-10}}</ref>  He was also named the outstanding back in the country by ''The New York Sun'' and received the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football]] trophy as the most valuable player in the [[Big Ten Conference]].  Glasgow was also honored by being selected to play for the East team in the 1930 [[East-West Shrine Game]].  He scored one of the East's touchdowns in a 19&ndash;7 win but also suffered a shoulder injury in the Shrine Game that hampered his professional baseball career.<ref name=Obit/> 

In four years of football at Iowa, Glasgow was credited with running for 1,424 yards on 364 attempts for an average of four yards per attempt.  He scored a total of 80 points for the Hawkeyes on 10 touchdowns 17 extra points, and one field goal.  He successfully converted 17 out of 22 extra point kicks.<ref>{{cite news|title=GLASGOW GAINS 4 YARD AVERAGE: Three Year Record Shows 1,424 Yards Is Made in 364 Attempts|newspaper=Mason City Globe-Gazette|date=1929-11-28}}</ref>

At the end of 1929, officials of the University of Iowa athletic department selected Glasgow as one of the 12 greatest Iowa athletes of all time in all sports.<ref>{{cite news|title=DOZEN ATHLETES RANKED AS IOWA ALL-TIME STARS|newspaper=The Lima News|date=1929-12-29}}</ref>  Glasgow graduated from Iowa with a bachelor of arts degree in 1930.<ref name=Seeks/>

===Legal career===
Glasgow attended law school at the [[University of Iowa College of Law]] while playing professional football, using the money he earned in the NFL to pay for his legal education.<ref name=HOF/>  During the 1932 college football season, Glasgow was asked to serve as an assistant coach at Iowa under head coach [[Ossie Solem]]. Glasgow was in his final year of law school at the time and sought the extra remuneration to pay his expenses.  However, the Big Ten at the time had a rule that prevented players who had played professional football from obtaining coaching positions at Big Ten schools.  Glasgow applied to the conference for reinstatement of his amateur status, but the application was denied.<ref>{{cite news|author=William Braucher|title=Hooks & Slides: Big Ten: What a Pal!|newspaper=Iola Daily Register|date=1932-11-07}}</ref>
