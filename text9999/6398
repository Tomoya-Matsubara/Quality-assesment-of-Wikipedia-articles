'''''Fawlty Towers''''' is a [[British sitcom]] produced by [[BBC Television]] and first broadcast on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1975. Twelve episodes were produced (two series each of six episodes).

The setting is a fictional hotel named Fawlty Towers, in the seaside town of [[Torquay]], on the "[[English Riviera]]" (which is also the location of the Gleneagles Hotel that inspired the series). The show was written by [[John Cleese]] and his then wife [[Connie Booth]], both of whom played major characters. The first series in 1975 was produced and directed by [[John Howard Davies]]; the second in 1979 was produced by Douglas Argent and directed by [[Bob Spiers]].

In a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000, voted by industry professionals, ''Fawlty Towers'' placed first.<ref>[http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/ BFI TV100]. Retrieved 4 June 2009.</ref> It was also voted fifth in the BBC's "[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]" poll in 2004.<ref name = "pnkssn">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/winner.shtml Britain's Best Sitcom Top 10].

==Origins==
In May 1970 the [[Monty Python]] team booked a stay in the Gleneagles Hotel (a reference was made to the Gleneagles in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location. John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner [[Donald Sinclair (hotel owner)|Donald Sinclair]] whom Cleese later described as "the most marvellously rude man I've ever met." This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing [[Eric Idle]]'s suitcase behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (it actually contained a ticking alarm clock). He also criticised the US-born [[Terry Gilliam]]'s [[table manners]] for not being 'British' (switching hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner.

At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' for [[London Weekend Television]]. An early prototype of the character that would become known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third ''Doctor'' series (titled ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]''). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by [[Timothy Bateson]]) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/d/doctoratlarge_7772270.shtml ''BBC Comedy Guide Doctor At Large'']. Retrieved 24 February 2007.</ref> Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, [[Video Arts]].

Cleese said in 2009 that the first ''Fawlty Towers'' script, written with then-wife [[Connie Booth]], was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,
{{blockquote|"Connie and I wrote that first episode and we sent it in to Jimmy Gilbert," the executive "whose job it was to assess the quality of the writing said, and I can quote [his note to me] fairly accurately, 'This is full of clich<U+00E9>d situations and stereotypical characters and I cannot see it as being anything other than a disaster.' And Jimmy himself said, 'You're going to have to get them out of the hotel, John, you can't do the whole thing in the hotel.' Whereas, of course, it's in the hotel that the whole pressure cooker builds up."<ref name=londontimes5-6-09>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio /article6234702.ece "John Cleese: BBC rejected first episode of ''Fawlty Towers''"] ''[[The Times]]'' / TimesOnline, May 6, 2009</ref>}}

Cleese added that due to the low wage the BBC paid him for the show <U+2014> <U+00A3>6,000 for 43 weeks' filming <U+2014> he had to support himself by appearing in [[television commercials]].<ref name=londontimes5-6-09 />

[[Bill Cotton]], the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the show get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Although the series is set in Torquay in [[Devon]], none of it was shot in south west England. For the exterior filming, instead of a hotel, the [[Wooburn Grange Country Club]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] was used. It later served as a [[nightclub]] named "Basil's" for a short time after the series ended, before being destroyed by a fire in March 1991. The remnants of the building were demolished and the site was bought by developers.<ref>[http://www.fawltysite.net/wooburngrange.htm Photographs of fire] at Fawltysite.net. Retrieved 14 June 2006.</ref> Other location filming was done mostly around [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[Middlesex]]. In the episode "The Germans", the opening shot is of [[Northwick Park Hospital]]. In the episode "Gourmet Night", the exterior of Andre's restaurant was filmed on Preston Road in the Harrow area. The launderette next door to the restaurant still exists today and Andre's is now a Chinese restaurant called "Wings".

During the introduction, the ''Fawlty Towers'' sign outside the hotel would be shown with its letters rearranged differently in each episode, spelling out terms like ''Watery Fowls'' or ''Fatty Owls''. 

Cleese and Booth were married to each other at the time of the first series. By the second, they had been divorced for almost a year, after ten years of union (1968<U+2013>78).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0532343/ ''Britain's Best Sitcom <U+2013> The case for Fawlty Towers''], BBC Documentary presented by [[Jack Dee]], broadcast 24 January 2004</ref>

Both Cleese and Booth were so keen on every script being perfect, some episodes took four months and ten drafts to write until they were satisfied.<ref name=museumTV>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Goddard |title=FAWLTY TOWERS: British Situation Comedy |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/fawltytowers/fawltytowers.htm |publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref>

== Plot directions and examples ==
The series focuses on the exploits and misadventures of short-fused hotelier [[#Basil Fawlty|Basil Fawlty]], his wife [[#Sybil Fawlty|Sybil]] and their employees, [[porter (carrier)|porter]] and waiter [[#Manuel|Manuel]], maid [[#Polly Sherman|Polly]], and (in the second series) chef [[Terry the Chef|Terry]]. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in 'raising the tone' of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and in particular his formidable wife, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as "that golfing [[Bitis|puff adder]]", "my little [[piranha]] fish" and "my little nest of [[Viperidae|viper]]s". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of "Basil!" At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance.

The plots are occasionally intricate and always [[farce|farcical]], involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The [[innuendo]] of the [[bedroom farce]] is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] Basil) but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events that take place in each episode happen in such a way that they negatively affect Basil's personality and test what little patience he has to breaking point, sometimes causing his mental state to deteriorate to the point where he has all but suffered a total breakdown by the end of the episode (some cut to the credits as he is on the brink of doing so).

The guests at the hotel are typically [[double act|comic foils]] to Basil's anger and outbursts. Each episode's one-shot guest characters provide a different characteristic that he cannot stand (including promiscuity, being working class, or being foreign). Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted seem to annoy him, with the episode "Communication Problems" revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs Richards (not to mention the contributions from dotty resident [[Major Gowen]], one of the show's other regular characters). By the end, Basil faints just at the mention of her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild [[black humour]] at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in some of the comments made by Basil both about Sybil ("Did you ever see that film, ''[[How to Murder Your Wife]]''? ... Awfully good. I saw it six times.") and the guests ("May I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.").

Basil's physical outbursts are primarily directed at Manuel (an emotional but largely innocent [[Spain|Spaniard]] whose almost complete lack of English vocabulary causes him to make elementary mistakes) and include beating the hapless waiter with a frying pan and smacking him on the forehead with a spoon. The violence directed at Manuel has been one of the few reasons for negative criticism levelled at ''Fawlty Towers''.  Sybil, on the other hand, is always condescending towards Manuel, excusing his behavior to guests with, "oh, he's from Barcelona."

Basil often displays blatant snobbishness in order to climb the social ladder, frequently expressing disdain for the "[[hoi polloi|riff-raff]]", "[[cretin]]s" and "[[yobbo]]s" that he believes to regularly populate his hotel. His desperation is readily apparent, as he makes increasingly hopeless manoeuvres and painful ''[[faux pas]]'' in trying to curry favour with those whom he perceives to have superior social status.  Yet, he regularly finds himself forced to serve those individuals he sees as beneath him.  As such, Basil's efforts tend to be counter-productive, with guests leaving the hotel in disgust and his marriage (and sanity) stretching further and further towards breaking point.

==Characters==
===Basil Fawlty===
[[File:Basil Fawlty.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Basil Fawlty]]]]
'''[[Basil Fawlty]]''', played by [[John Cleese]], is a [[snob]]bish and [[miser]]ly [[misanthropy|misanthrope]] who is desperate to belong to a higher social class. He sees the successful running of the hotel as a means of achieving this ("turn it into an establishment of class..."), yet his job forces him to be pleasant to people he despises or aspires to be above socially.

He is terrified of his wife [[Sybil Fawlty]]'s sharp tongue. He yearns to stand up to her, but his plans frequently conflict with her desires. She is often verbally abusive towards him (memorably describing him as "an ageing, [[brilliantine]]d stick insect") but although he towers over the diminutive Sybil, he often finds himself on the receiving end of her temper, expressed verbally or physically. Basil usually turns to Manuel or Polly to help him with whatever scheme he has planned, while trying his best to prevent Sybil from finding out. However, there are occasions where Basil is shown to lament about the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost forever. Also, it appears as though he still does care for her in some way. The penultimate episode <U+2014>  "[[The Anniversary (Fawlty Towers)|The Anniversary]]" <U+2014> revolves around his efforts to put together a nice surprise anniversary get-together present, involving their closest friends. Things go wrong immediately as, because of Basil's pretending the date doesn't remind him of anything so as to enhance the surprise (gamely accepting a slap in the process), Sybil believes he really has forgotten, and leaves the hotel in a huff. In an interview for the documentary on the DVD box set, Cleese claims that this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, focusing on fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been more episodes like this).

In keeping with the general lack of explanation about the marriage, not much is revealed of the characters' back-stories. It is known that Basil served in the [[British Army]] and saw action in the [[Korean War]], possibly as part of his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]]. He exaggerates this period of his life, suggesting he spent time in active front line service and proclaiming to strangers: "I killed four men." To this Sybil jokes that "He was in the [[Army Catering Corps|Catering Corps]]. He used to poison them." Basil is often seen wearing a military tie (as well as that of the [[Royal Agricultural College]]), and his moustache seems to betray an army background. He also claims to have sustained an injury to his leg during the action, caused by [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], although apparently it tends to flare up at surprisingly convenient times for him. The only person toward whom Basil, for the most part, consistently exhibits patience and decent manners is the old and senile [[Major Gowen]], a veteran officer for either of the [[World war|World Wars]] (which one is never specified) who permanently resides at the hotel. When interacting with Manuel, Basil displays a rudimentary ability with Spanish which is not entirely explained in any of the episodes (although Basil does at one point say that he "learned classical Spanish, not the strange dialect he [Manuel] seems to have picked up"); this ability is also predictably ridiculed, as in the first episode where a guest, whom Basil has immediately mentally labelled a working-class oik, communicates fluently with Manuel in Spanish after Basil's failed attempt to do so.

Cleese himself described Basil as thinking that "he could run a first-rate hotel if he didn't have all the guests getting in the way," and as being "an absolutely awful human being", but says that in comedy, if an awful person makes people laugh, people unaccountably feel affectionate toward him.<ref>An Interview with John Cleese, DVD Special Programs, 2001</ref> Indeed, he is not entirely unsympathetic. The "Hotel Inspectors" and "Waldorf Salad" episodes both feature guests who are shown to be deeply annoying with constant, and unreasonable demands, namely Messers Hutchinson and Hamilton. In "Gourmet Night", it's the chef that gets drunk and is unable to cook dinner, leaving Basil to scramble in an attempt to salvage the evening.  Much of the time, he is an unfortunate victim of circumstance.

===Sybil Fawlty===
[[File:Sybil Fawlty.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Sybil Fawlty]]]]
'''[[Sybil Fawlty]]''', played by [[Prunella Scales]], is Basil's wife. Energetic and petite she prefers a working wardrobe of high heeled shoes, tight skirt suits in vivid shiny fabrics over black underwear, and sports a tower of permed and back-combed hair necessitating the use of overnight [[curlers]].

She is often seen to be a more effective manager of the hotel, making sure Basil either gets certain jobs done or stays out of the way when she is handling difficult customers. Despite this, she rarely participates directly in the running of the hotel. During busy check-in sessions or meal-times, while everyone else is working, she is frequently chatting to a customer in the bar or talking on the phone to one of her friends. She is usually on the phone to Audrey, who makes her sole on-camera appearance in "The Anniversary", repeating the phrase "Oohhh, I knoooooooow". Sybil has a distinctive conversational tone and braying laugh, which her husband compares to "someone machine-gunning a seal". Being his wife, she is the only regular character who refers to Basil by his first name. When (frequently) she barks this at him, he is generally stopped in his tracks, often flinching.

Basil refers to her by a number of epithets, occasionally to her face, including "that golfing puff-adder", "the dragon", "toxic midget", "the sabre-toothed tart", "my little kommandant", "my little nest of vipers", and "you rancorous, coiffured old sow". Despite these less than complimentary nicknames, Basil is terrified of her. There is only one time in the entire series that he loses patience and snaps at her.

Sybil and Basil Fawlty are said to have married on 17 April 1958 and started their hotel in 1960. Prunella Scales has said that the reason Sybil married Basil was because his origins were of a higher social class than hers. In [[Gourmet Night]] she recounts an anecdote about "Uncle Ted and his crate of brown ale." This and some of Sybil's behaviour suggests a working class background.

===Polly Sherman===
'''Polly Sherman''', played by [[Connie Booth]], is  a [[waitress]] and general helper at the hotel. She often stands as the voice of sanity during chaotic moments, but is frequently embroiled in ridiculous masquerades as she loyally attempts to aid Basil in trying to cover a mistake or keep something from Sybil. 

In "The Anniversary" she complied with Basil's request that she impersonate a purportedly ill Sybil in front of the Fawltys' closest friends, under the mask of semi-darkenss and a makeshift disguise. In this case there was a condition: she would only assist him if he loaned her the money he had previously refused to loan.

Polly is generally good-natured but sometimes shows her frustration. In [[The Kipper and the Corpse]], the pampered shih-tzu dog of an elderly guest bit Polly and Manuel. As revenge Polly laced the dog's sausages with hot pepper, [[chilli powder]] and [[Tabasco sauce]] causing it to take ill. 

Polly is apparently employed part-time (during meal times). In the first series she is said to be an art student who, according to Basil, has spent three years at university. Polly is not referred to as a student in the second series. Despite her part-time employment, as the most competent of the hotel staff, she is frequently saddled with many other duties. In one episode, she is seen to draw a sketch (presumably an [[impressionist]]ic [[caricature]]) of Basil, which everyone but Basil immediately recognises. Polly is also a student of languages, displaying ability with both Spanish and German. In "The Germans" Basil alludes to Polly's polyglot inclination by saying that she does her work "while learning two oriental languages". Like Manuel, she has a room of her own at the hotel.

===Manuel===
[[File:Manuel Waiter.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Manuel]]]]
'''[[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|Manuel]]''', a [[waiter]] played by [[Andrew Sachs]], is a well-meaning but disorganised and constantly confused [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] from [[Barcelona]] with a poor grasp of the [[English language]] and customs.  He is verbally and physically abused by his boss. When told by either Basil, Sybil, or Polly what to do, he often answers, "<U+00BF>Qu<U+00E9>?" ("What?"). Manuel's character was used to demonstrate Basil's instinctive lack of sensitivity and tolerance. Every episode would involve Basil becoming enraged at least a couple of times by not only Manuel's confusion at his boss's bizarre and complicated demands, but also with basic requests. Manuel is afraid of Fawlty's quick temper and violent assaults, yet often expresses his appreciation for being given a steady source of income in what seems to him an endlessly perplexing society. His relentlessly enthusiastic demeanour and lavish pride in what little English he has grasped suggest that at least some of his persistent difficulties stem from his employers' persistently poor communication skills.

During the making of the series, Sachs twice suffered a serious injury while playing Manuel. Cleese describes using a real metal pan to knock him unconscious in "The Wedding Party" episode, although he would have preferred to use a rubber one.  The original producer/director, John Howard Davies, explains in the director's commentary that he made Basil use a metal one and that he was responsible for most of the violence on the show, which he felt was essential and intrinsic to the type of comical farce that they were trying to create. Later, when his clothes were treated in order to make them give off smoke after he had been let out of the burning kitchen in "[[The Germans]]", the corrosive chemicals used went through them and gave Sachs severe burns.<ref>John Cleese, VHS or DVD cast interview, 1998</ref>

Manuel's exaggerated Spanish accent is an integral part of the humour of the show. Sachs' native language is German; he emigrated to Britain as a child.<ref>{{cite news | title =Variety Club <U+2013> Jewish Chronicle colour supplement "350 years"| pages=28<U+2013>29| publisher =The Jewish Chronicle| date =15 December 2006 | accessdate =24 December 2006 }}</ref>

The character's nationality was switched to Italian (and the name to Paolo) for the Spanish dub of the show, while in [[Catalonia]] he is a Mexican (still called Manuel).<ref>[http://dvdenlared.com/dvd/Fawlty%20Towers:%20Volumen%201/Analisis/20050109015234.html Reviewed by David G<U+00F3>mez Tato, 09-01-2005].

===Other regular characters and themes===
'''[[Terry (Fawlty Towers)|Terry]]''', played by [[Brian Hall (actor)|Brian Hall]], is the laid-back Cockney chef at Fawlty Towers. Terry's cooking methods are likewise somewhat casual, which sometimes frustrates and worries the neurotic Basil. He appears in only the second series of episodes. During the first series, there was no regular chef character seen in the show. The only first series chef was "new" chef Kurt, seen in "Gourmet Night", who quickly proved himself incapable of holding the job when, after being rebuffed after making a sexual advance to Manuel, lapsed into his old alcoholic ways. Terry used to work in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] (not at [[Dorchester Hotel|The Dorchester]], as briefly believed by a guest). In "[[The Anniversary (Fawlty Towers)|The Anniversary]]" Terry and Manuel come to blows as he takes offence at someone else cooking in his kitchen, and proceeds to sabotage Manuel's attempt to make [[paella]] for Sybil, leading to fisticuffs between them at the end of the episode.

'''[[Major Gowen]]''', played by [[Ballard Berkeley]], is a slightly senile, amiable old soldier who holds permanent residence in the hotel. He is one of the very few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is possibly because of his former status in the military, making him a symbol of the [[The Establishment|establishment]] status that Basil craves. He is often introduced as their "oldest resident". He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and bemoaning workers' strikes, and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode "[[List of Fawlty Towers episodes|The Germans]]", he  shows that he <U+2013> like Basil, as it transpires <U+2013> has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the World Wars; the best he can say about them is that German women supposedly make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated attitudes towards race where he makes clear the ethnic difference between "[[Wog#British English|wog]]s" and "[[Nigger#British|nigger]]s" <U+2014> but in a manner apparently innocent of malice or derogatory bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's devious plans to go catastrophically awry, notably in the episode "[[Communication Problems]]", when Basil tries his best to keep the money he won betting on a horse race a secret from Sybil.

'''[[Miss Tibbs & Miss Gatsby]]''', played by [[Gilly Flower]] and [[Renee Roberts]] respectively, are the other two permanent residents. Seemingly inseparable, these sweet-natured but cheerfully dotty spinsters appear to have taken a fancy to Basil, feeling as though they need to take care of him. In response to their fond solicitude, Basil vacillates between a sycophantic and [[superficial charm]] through to hostility and blunt rudeness during his various conversations with them.

'''Audrey''', a mostly [[unseen character]], had one on-screen appearance in "The Anniversary". Audrey is Sybil's lifelong best friend, and mostly appears in the form of gossiping, trivial telephone calls to Sybil. Audrey is a refuge for Sybil from the hotel and from Basil's ludicrous situations. When times get tough (Audrey has a dysfunctional relationship with her husband George), Sybil will offer solutions and guidance, often resulting in the catchphrase "Ohhh, I knowwww..." when she tries to commiserate with Audrey's problems. In Audrey's one on-screen appearance she is played by actress Christine Shaw. She is mentioned in "The Hotel Inspectors", "The Wedding Party", "Gourmet Night", "The Psychiatrist" and "The Kipper and the Corpse".

'''The Paperboy''', though rarely seen, is significant as he is revealed to be the prankster who rearranges the letters on the "Fawlty Towers" sign to read various (sometimes crude) phrases.<ref>This is revealed at the beginning of "The Psychiatrist" episode in the second series.</ref>  This may have been because of Basil's sharp attitude towards him when he was late with a delivery.  The shot of the sign (with the hotel exterior in the background) appears at the beginning of every episode but one, "[[The Germans]]", when a shot of a hospital is used, as this is the only episode which doesn't begin at the hotel. During the first series, the sign slowly deteriorated throughout the season until almost no letters were left in episode four. Episode five brings the first semi-anagram: "Warty Towels". In the second series, the first episode sign spells 'Fawlty Tower' letter "L" being noticeably askew, and changes in each subsequent episode, from the correct spelling to various semi-anagrams (only "Flowery [[Twats]]" from the 11th episode, "The Anniversary", is a proper [[anagram]] using all original letters.)  The changes progress as follows:

*Episode 7: "Fawlty Tower" (the letter "L" is askew)
*Episode 8: "Watery Fowls"
*Episode 9: "Flay Otters"
*Episode 10: "Fatty Owls"
*Episode 11: "Flowery Twats"
*Episode 12: "Farty Towels"

==Episode guide==
{{Main|List of Fawlty Towers episodes}}

The first edition of ''Fawlty Towers'' was originally broadcast on 19 September 1975. The 12th and final show was first shown on 25 October 1979. The first series was directed by John Howard Davies, the second by Bob Spiers. Both series had their premieres on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].

Production of the last two episodes was disrupted by a [[strike action|strike]] of BBC technical staff, which resulted in the recasting of the role of Reg (the wisecracking friend of Basil and Sybil) in "The Anniversary", and delayed the episode's transmission date by one week. The episode "Basil the Rat" was also delayed, not being screened until the end of a repeat showing six months later.

''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' was originally scheduled to debut after an episode of ''Fawlty Towers'' and Cleese was to have introduced ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' in a sketch referring to the technicians' strike, explaining (in character as Basil Fawlty) that there was no show ready that week, so a "tatty revue" would be broadcast instead. However, the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] intervened, and ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' was postponed as being too political. Later that year, Cleese's sketch was broadcast, but its original significance was lost.

When originally transmitted, the individual episodes had no on-screen titles. The ones in common currency were first used for the VHS release of the series in the 1980s. There were working titles, such as "USA" for "Waldorf Salad", "Death" for "The Kipper and the Corpse", and "Rat" for "Basil the Rat", which have been printed in some programme guides. In addition, some of the early BBC audio releases of episodes on vinyl and cassette included other variations, such as "Mrs. Richards" and "The Rat" for "Communication Problems" and "Basil the Rat" respectively.

It has long been rumoured that a thirteenth episode of the series was written and filmed, but never progressed further than a rough cut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fawltysite.net/thirteenth-episode.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403090421/http://www.fawltysite.net/thirteenth-episode.htm |archivedate=3 April 2007 |title=fawltysite.net <U+2013> Thirteenth Episode|year=2004}}</ref>  Lars Holger Holm, author of the book ''Fawlty Towers: A Worshipper's Companion'', has made detailed claims about the episode's content, but he provides no evidence of its existence and it is most likely a hoax or [[fan fiction]].

On the subject of whether more episodes would be produced, Cleese revealed (in an interview for the complete DVD box set, which was republished in the book, ''Fawlty Towers Fully Booked'') that he once had the genesis of a feature-length special <U+2013> possibly sometime during the mid-1990s. The plot (which was never fleshed out beyond his initial idea) would have revolved around the chaos that a now-retired Basil typically caused as he and Sybil flew to [[Barcelona]] to visit their former employee Manuel and his family. Of the idea, Cleese said:

<blockquote>We had an idea for a plot which I loved. Basil was finally invited to Spain to meet Manuel's family. He gets to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and then spends about 14 frustrating hours waiting for the flight. Finally, on the plane, a [[terrorist]] pulls a gun and tries to hijack the thing. Basil is so angry he overcomes the terrorist and when the pilot says, "We have to fly back to Heathrow", Basil says, "No, fly us to Spain or I'll shoot you". He arrives in Spain, immediately arrested and spends the entire holiday in a Spanish jail. He is released just in time to go back on the plane with Sybil.

It was very funny, but I couldn't do it at the time. Making ''Fawlty Towers'' work at 90 minutes was a very difficult proposition. You can build up the comedy for 30 minutes, but at that length there has to be a trough and another peak. It doesn't interest me. I don't want to do it.</blockquote>

Cleese may also have relented because of the lack of Connie Booth's involvement. She had practically retreated from public life after the show finished (and had been initially unwilling to collaborate on a second series, which explains the four-year gap between productions).

The decision by Cleese and Booth to quit before a third series has often been lauded, as it ensured an avoidance of the possibility that the show's immediately-high status could be weakened with lower quality work later down the line. (Cleese in particular was most likely motivated in making the choice by the end of his involvement with the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' TV series, which he departed after claiming to have run out of ideas for sketches.) Subsequently, it has inspired the makers of other shows to do likewise. Most notably, [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]] refused to make a third series of either ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' or ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', citing ''Fawlty Towers''' short lifespan as the reason. [[Rik Mayall]], [[Ben Elton]] and [[Lise Mayer]], the writers behind ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', which also only ran for two series (each with six episodes likewise), used this explanation too. Elton also took the decision to end his next sitcom, ''[[Filthy Rich & Catflap]]'', after only one series, despite its popularity.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
The series was not held in as high esteem on its original broadcast as it later was. The ''Daily Mirror'' review of the show in 1975 had the headline "Long John Short On Jokes".<ref name="audience">{{cite web

<blockquote>"...devoid of everything that makes good modern comedy. The programme is reminiscent of the post-war university drama society production.....The idea behind ''Fawlty Towers'' had the makings of one good sketch for John Cleese, who has in the past been shown to such good effect in original sketch material. The series, however, has over-acting and exaggeration on his part which is embarrassing to watch, writing that has no vestige of wit or skill about it and set pieces that are protracted and neither funny nor slapstick; the whole is pervaded by ill-humour. There is no warmth, no vulnerability of characters, no pathos, no visual cleverness, no funny lines. It is an amalgam of everything that does not reach out to an audience and is the epitome of self indulgence by those concerned. One funny walk and a shouting, bullying tone do not make a comedy series; it is twenty-five years too late for that.....Mr Cleese has to learn (if he has not already done so) not to be deluded by applauding critics just as he must observe those who do not applaud. ''Fawlty Towers'' is a try and there have to be many in comedy. But when the try has been made it is time to move on, to change and adapt, bearing the lessons in mind: the most important being a growing awareness of what one is good at doing and what is out of reach of one's ability and personal attributes"<ref>{{cite news |title=Strange chorus of praise for poor comedy | date = 14 September 1976 |url=http://badshowgoons.blog.co.uk/?tag=fawlty+towers | publisher = Television Today |location=London}}</ref></blockquote>

Another critic of the show was [[Richard Ingrams]], then television reviewer for ''[[The Spectator]]''. Cleese got his revenge by naming one of the guests in the second series 'Mr Ingrams', who is caught in his room with a blow up doll.<ref name="audience">{{cite news

In an interview for the "TV Characters" edition of [[Channel 4]]'s 'talking heads' strand [[100 Greatest / 100 Worst|100 Greatest]] (in which Basil placed second, between [[Homer Simpson]] and [[Edmund Blackadder]]), TV critic [[A. A. Gill]] theorised that the initially muted response may have been caused by Cleese seemingly ditching his label as a comic revolutionary <U+2013> earned through his years with Python <U+2013> to do something more traditional. He also admitted that he had been one of that chorus when he was young (despite his mother, Yvonne Gilan, being in one of the episodes; she played the saucy French woman in "The Wedding Party"). According to Gill, "that shows you what I know about this business."

===Awards===
Three [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s were awarded to people for their involvement with the series. Each of the two series were awarded the BAFTA in the category for "Best Situation Comedy", the first won by John Howard Davies in 1976, and the second by Douglas Argent and Bob Spiers in 1980. John Cleese won the BAFTA for "Best Light Entertainment Performance" in 1976.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072500/awards List of awards] at IMDb. Retrieved 14 June 2006.</ref>

More recently, in a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, ''Fawlty Towers'' was placed first. It was also voted fifth in the BBC's "[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]" poll in 2004<ref name = "pnkssn"/> and second only to ''[[Frasier]]'' in The Ultimate Sitcom poll of comedy writers in January 2006. [[Basil Fawlty]] came top of the ''Britain's Funniest Comedy Character'' poll, held by [[Five (channel)|Five]] on 14 May 2006.

==Remakes and reunions==
Three attempted [[List of British TV shows remade for the American market|remakes]] of ''Fawlty Towers'' were started for the American market, with two making it into production. The first, ''Chateau Snavely'' starring [[Harvey Korman]] and [[Betty White]], was produced by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for a pilot in 1978, but the transfer from coastal hotel to highway motel proved too much and the series was never produced. The second, also by ABC, was ''[[Amanda's]]'' starring [[Bea Arthur]], notable for switching the sexes of its 'Basil' and 'Sybil' equivalents. It also failed to pick up a major audience and was dropped.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/f/fawltytowers_7772600.shtml ''Fawlty Towers'' at the BBC Guide to comedy]. Retrieved 14 June 2006.</ref> A third remake called ''[[Payne (TV series)|Payne]]'' (produced by and starring [[John Larroquette]]) was also produced, but was cancelled shortly after. A German pilot based on the sitcom was made in 2001, named ''Zum letzten Kliff'', but further episodes were not made.

The popular sitcoms ''[[3rd Rock From The Sun]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]'' (both of which Cleese appeared in) have cited ''Fawlty Towers'' as an inspiration, especially regarding its depiction of a dysfunctional "family" in the workplace. Also [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]] and [[Graham Linehan]] have cited ''Fawlty Towers'' as a major influence on their sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''. ''[[Guest House (TV series)|Guest House]]'' on Pakistan's [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]] also resembled the series.

Several of the characters have made other appearances, as spin-offs or in small cameo roles. In 1981, in character as Manuel, Andrew Sachs recorded his own version of the [[Joe Dolce]] cod-Italian song "[[Shaddap You Face]]" (with the B-side "Waiter, There's a Spanish Flea in My Soup"). However, the record was not released after Joe Dolce took out an injunction; he was about to issue his version in Britain.<ref>[http://www.fawltysite.net/manuel.htm Fawltysite.net].

Retrieved 1 September 2006.</ref> In 2006, Cleese played Basil Fawlty for the first time in 27 years, for an unofficial England [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] song, "Don't Mention the War", named after the phrase Basil famously used in "[[The Germans]]".<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2180817,00.html Article about the song] by Adam Sherwin in ''[[The Times]]'', 15 May 2006</ref> In 2007, Cleese and Sachs reprised their roles for a six-episode corporate video for Norwegian oil company [[Statoil]]. In the video, Fawlty is running a restaurant called "Basil's Brasserie", while Manuel owns a [[Michelin Star]] restaurant in London.<ref>[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/07/12/5522/basils_back Basil's back], Chortle.co.uk.

In November 2007, Prunella Scales returned to the role of Sybil Fawlty in a series of sketches for the BBC's annual ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity telethon. The character was seen taking over the management of the eponymous hotel from the BBC drama series ''[[Hotel Babylon]]'', interacting with characters from that programme as well as other 1970s sitcom characters. The character of Sybil was used by permission of John Cleese.<ref name="rt01">{{cite journal|title=The Inside Story|journal=[[Radio Times]]|volume=335|issue=4361|date=10<U+2013>13 November 2007|page=p. 126}}</ref>

==''Fawlty Towers: Re-Opened''==
In 2009, [[Tiger Aspect Productions]] produced a two-part documentary for digital comedy channel [[G.O.L.D.]], called ''Fawlty Towers: Re-Opened''. The documentary features interviews with all four main cast members, including Connie Booth, who refused to talk about the series for 30 years.<ref>{{cite news|author=Parker, Robin|date=23 March 2009|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/03/gold_to_reopen_fawlty_towers.html|title=Gold to reopen Fawlty Towers|work=Broadcastnow|accessdate=23 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1177908/Fawlty-Towers-originally-rejected-BBC-clich-d-reveals-John-Cleese-30th-anniversary-reunion.html|title=Fawlty Towers was originally rejected by the BBC for being clich<U+00E9>d, reveals John Cleese at 30th anniversary reunion|date=6 May 2009|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref> John Cleese confirmed at the 30 year reunion in May 2009 that they will never make another episode of the comedy because they are too old and tired, and expectations would be too high.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8036055.stm|title= Cleese rules out return of Fawlty |date=6 May 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref>  In a television interview (shown in Australia on [[Seven Network]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]) on 7 May 2009, Cleese also commented that he and Connie Booth took six weeks to write each episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a155249/john-cleese-fawlty-towers-re-opened.html|title=John Cleese ('Fawlty Towers: Re-Opened'|date=8 May 2009|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5286579/Fawlty-Towers-the-classic-sitcom-the-BBC-didnt-want.html|title=Fawlty Towers: the classic sitcom the BBC didn<U+2019>t want|date=6 May 2009|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=9 May 2009 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Deacon}}</ref>

==Overseas==
In just 1977 and 1978 alone, it was sold to 45 stations in 17 countries and was the BBC's best selling overseas programme for that year. Although it was initially a flop in Spain, because of the portrayal of the Spanish waiter Manuel, it was successfully resold, with Manuel's nationality changed to Italian.<ref name=museumTV/> To show how badly it translated, Clive James picked up a clip containing Manuel's "<U+00BF>Qu<U+00E9>?" phrase to show on [[Clive James on Television]] in 1982.

The series is still shown in the United States on at least one [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station. [[Maryland Public Television]], which covers [[Maryland|the state of the same name]] and the surrounding area, airs all episodes in order on Tuesday afternoons (4:00 pm [[Eastern Time|ET]]) and Saturday nights (11:00 pm ET), along with other BBC sitcoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpt.org/schedule/series.cfm?series_id=5520 |title=Fawlty Towers |publisher=MPT |date= |accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

==Home video releases==
''Fawlty Towers'' was originally released by BBC Video in 1984, but was edited with the credits from all 3 episodes put at the end of the tape.
It was re-released in 1995 unedited and remastered. It was re-released in 1998 with a special interview with [[John Cleese]].
