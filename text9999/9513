[[Image:MTC.JPG|right]]The '''Marin Theatre Company''' is a professional [[regional theatre]] located in [[Mill Valley, California]].

It was founded as the Mill Valley Center for the Performing Arts by Sali Lieberman and Al White in 1966, with its first twenty seasons produced at the Mill Valley Golf Club. In 1984, it was rechristened the Marin Theatre Company to acknowledge its role as the [[San Francisco|San Francisco Bay Area]]'s most prominent group dedicated to providing the community with works by both established and emerging [[playwright]]s ranging from [[Anton Chekov]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]] to [[Arthur Miller]], [[David Mamet]], and [[Christopher Durang]]. Presently it offers a season of five classic and contemporary plays and musicals in the Herb & Grace Boyer Mainstage Theatre and a series of staged readings in the Studio Theatre to nearly 40,000 patrons.

MTC sponsors three full-day, four-week Summer Camps, each devoted to a specific project, featuring theatre training in the morning and rehearsals in the afternoon. Students study [[improvisation]], acting, [[musical theatre]], vocal technique, and [[dance]]. Each camp culminates in a weekend of fully-mounted productions presented to the public.

''MTC Engaged!'' is a program that offers the audience access to the performers and playwrights after each performance and allows them to follow the evolution of each production via daily [[blog]]s posted to the MTC [[website]].
