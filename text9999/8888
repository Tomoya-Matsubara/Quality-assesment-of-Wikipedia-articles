'''''Diana''''' was a BBC TV series first broadcast in 1984 and adapted from two books by [[R. F. Delderfield]]. The adaptation was by the prolific [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]].

It follows the intersecting but very different lives of Jan, a poor but studious young country lad and Diana, the equally single minded daughter of a rich landowner, from the 1920s through to post-war Britain. The early story revolves around the class mismatch between the pair; the besotted Jan attempts to elevate his status through hard work and the more aloof Diana attempts to keep her affections in check and pursue her own goals.  

Unusually, despite a generally warm reception and a host of stars &ndash; including a young [[Patsy Kensit]] &ndash; it has never been repeated on the BBC and has never been made available for purchase.
