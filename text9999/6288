'''Greene''' is a [[village]] in [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]], [[New York]], [[USA]]. The population was 1,580 at the 2010 census. The village is named after General [[Nathanael Greene]].

The '''Village of Greene''' is within the [[Greene (town), New York|Town of Greene]] and is northeast of [[Binghamton, New York]].

== History ==
The village was the site of the first settlement in the town, around 1792 by Stephen Ketchum, and was originally called "Hornby." The town later, in 1806, changed the name to that of the Revolutionary War general. The Village of Greene was laid out in 1806 and incorporated in 1842. In 1982, many of its historic buildings were included in the [[Greene Historic District]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> The village of Greene has been for many years the squirrel sighting capitol of Upstate New York. Greene is also a well-known site for fish whisperers and cabbage enthusiasts alike.  The frequently cleansed Chenango River is a haven for wild life, such as the Great Horned Owl and the Eastern Opossum.

==Geography==

The village is on the bank of the [[Chenango River]] and was located near the former [[Chenango Canal]].  The Utica Branch of the [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway]], formerly the [[Lackawanna Railroad]], later [[Erie Lackawanna]], later [[Conrail]], follows the river as well through the area.  It has been inactive since devastating floods during the Summer of 2006. 

[[New York State Route 12]] and [[New York State Route 206]] intersect in the village.
