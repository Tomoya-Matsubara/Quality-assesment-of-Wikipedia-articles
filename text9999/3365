[[Image:7Q5.jpg|thumb|right|Fragment 5 from Cave 7 of the Qumran Community in its entirety]]

Among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]], '''7Q5''' is the designation for a small Greek [[papyrus]] fragment discovered in [[Qumran]] Cave 7 and dated before anyone claimed to be able to identify it by its style of script as likely having been written sometime between 50 B.C.E. and 50 C.E. The significance of this fragment is derived from an argument made by Spanish papyrologist [[Jos<U+00E9> O<U+00B4>Callaghan Mart<U+00ED>nez|Jose O<U+00B4>Callaghan]] in his work ''<U+00BF>Papiros neotestamentarios en la cueva 7 de Qumr<U+00E2>n?'' ("New Testament Papyri in Cave 7 at Qumran?") in 1972, later reasserted and expanded by German scholar [[Carsten Peter Thiede]] in his work ''The Earliest Gospel Manuscript?'' in 1982. The assertion is that the previously unidentified 7Q5 is actually a fragment of the [[Gospel of Mark]], chapter 6 verse 52-53. The majority of scholars have not been convinced by O'Callaghan's and Thiede's identification<ref>

== Argument ==

[[Image:Cave7Q.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The 7th Cave at Qumran, where 7Q5 was found.]]

The argument depends on these assumptions: 

#  First, the combination of letters '''<U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C3>''' <nnes> in line 4 may be part of the word <U+0393><U+03B5>'''<U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C3>'''<U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03C4> <[[Gennesaret]]>.
#  Secondly, the spacing before the word '''<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9>''' <kai> ("and") suggests a paragraph break, which is consistent with the normative layout for Mark 6:52-53.
#  Furthermore, a computer search "using the most elaborate Greek texts ... has failed to yield any text other than Mark 6:52-53 for the combination of letters identified by O<U+2019>Callaghan et al. in 7Q5".<ref>Thiede n. 31, pp. 40-41</ref>

Several counterarguments exist. 
* The spacing before the word '''<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9>''' <kai> ("and") proposed as a paragraph break may not be indicative of anything.
:* In papyri spacings of this width can be also found within words (Pap. Bodmer XXIV, plate 26; in Qumran in fragment 4Q122).
:*  Other examples in the Qumran texts show that the word '''<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9>''' <kai> ("and") usually was separated with spacings - and this has nothing to do with the text's structure (as proposed by O'Callaghan).
* The sequence '''<U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C3>''' can be also found in the word <U+03B5><U+03B3><U+03B5>'''<U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C3>'''<U+03B5><U+03BD> <egennesen> ("begot"), which was the original suggestion as to its identity.
:* This suggestion was proposed by the authors of the fragment's first edition (''editio princeps'') published in 1962.
:* If so, the fragment likely would be part of a [[genealogy]] account.

Further counterarguments  
* To make the identification of the fragment with Mark 6:52-53, O'Callaghan had to substitute the letter '''<U+03B4>''' <d> with a '''<U+03C4>''' <t> in line 3, a substitution most scholars do not accept, although it is not without precedent in the ancient world.<ref name="wallace">{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}

* The identification of the last letter in line 2 with ''nu'' does not fit into the pattern of this Greek letter as it is clearly written in line 4.<ref>Gundry (1999)</ref>

* The computer search performed by Thiede assumed that all the disputed letter identifications made by O'Callaghan were correct, an assumption which, in fact, is rejected by scholars.
:* A similar search performed by scholar Daniel Wallace, which allowed other identifications for the disputed letters, found sixteen matches.<ref name="wallace"/>
:* A computer search performed with the undisputed letters of the fragment 7Q5 do not find the text Mk 6,52-53, because the undisputed letter '''<U+03C4>''' in line 3 does not fit to this text.<ref>See Wallace, footnote 18.</ref>

== Significance ==
If 7Q5 were identified as {{bibleref|Mark|6:52-53}} and was deposited in the cave at Qumran by 68 AD, it would become the earliest known fragment of the [[New Testament]], predating [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|P52]] by at least some if not many decades.

Since the amount of text in the manuscript is so small, even a confirmation of 7Q5 as Markan "might mean nothing more than that the contents of these few verses were already formalized, not necessarily that there was a manuscript of Mark's Gospel on hand".<ref>

</ref>  Since the entirety of the find in Cave 7 consists of fragments in Greek, it is possible that the contents of this cave are of a separate "Hellenized" library than the Hebrew texts found in the other caves. Additionally, as Robert Eisenman points out: "Most scholars agree that the scrolls were deposited in the cave in or around 68 AD, but often mistake this date...for the ''[[terminus ad quem]]'' for the deposit of the scrolls in the caves/cessation of Jewish habitation at the site, when it cannot be considered anything but the ''[[terminus ad quem|terminus a quo]]'' for both of these, i.e., not the latest but the ''earliest'' possible date for such a deposit and/or Jewish abandonment of the site. The actual ''terminus ad quem'' for both of these events, however difficult it may be to accept at first, is 136 AD."(''italics his'').<ref>

}}</ref> So, for this is long after the currently accepted date range for the composition of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], according to Eisenman this would mean that even if it could be proved that 7Q5 is a Mark's fragment, an earlier composition date for the gospel could not be proved.
Although the fragment has been analysed and dated paleographically, as Brent Nongbri said, the dating of a such small fragment on account of palegraphy is not appropriate.<ref>
[http://bible.org/article/7q5-earliest-nt-papyrus]. Alan Johnson: "Why all the furor? What is at stake? A number of things: (1) If this identification is correct, it would be the earliest NT MS by some 50-100 years;8 (2) on paleographical grounds, since the upper limit of its date is 50 CE, this would put Mark in the 40<U+2019>s at the latest"
