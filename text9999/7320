'''''Go<U+00E9>land''''' was the name ship of an eight-vessel class of "brick-[[aviso]]s" (advice brigs). She was built to a design by [[Raymond-Antoine Haran]] and launched in 1787. She served the French Navy for several years carrying dispatches until in 1793 {{HMS|Penelope|1783|6}} and {{HMS|Proserpine|1777|6}} captured her off [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>mie]]. The [[Royal Navy]] took her into service briefly; she was sold in 1794.

==French service==
''Lieutenant de vaisseau'' Le Tourneur carried dispatches from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to Newfoundland and St Pierre (probably [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]) on a voyage that lasted from 12 June 1790 until 3 November.<ref>''Fonds Marine'', Vol. 1, p.23.</ref> The renowned French naval officer, [[Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite]] served on her as a junior officer on one of these voyages when she escorted the fishing fleet from [[Granville, Manche|Granville]] to Newfoundland.<ref>Van Hille (2011), p.338.</ref>

On 12 September 1791 ''Go<U+00E9>land'' was at Brest, under the command of ''sous-lieutenant de vaisseau'' Le Dall de Kerangalet.<ref>''Fonds Marine'', Vol. 1, p.25.</ref>

In April 1793 ''Go<U+00E9>land'' was sailing from [[Cap-Ha<U+00EF>tien|Cap-Fran<U+00E7>ais]] to J<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>mie while under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Leiss<U+00E8>gues de Pennenyum.<ref>''Fonds Marine'', Vol. 1, p.54.</ref> Early on the 16th Leiss<U+00E8>gues was seeking to enter the bay while searching for a convoy he was to escort when he observed an enemy frigate at the entrance.{{#tag:ref|Troude gives the date as 26 April, but all other records give the date as 16 April.<ref name=Troude>Troude (1867), Vol. 2, p.301.</ref>|group=Note}} The British frigate immediately set out to drive ''Go<U+00E9>land'' on shore. At 7a.m. she received her first shots and by 9.a.m. the British frigate was no more than pistol-shot away. ''Go<U+00E9>land'' fired back, but resistance was futile. Leiss<U+00E8>gues was forced to [[striking the colours|strike]] to the frigate ''Penelope''.<ref name=Troude/> ''Proserpine'' shared with ''Penelope'' in the prize money, suggesting that she was in company with ''Penelope'', or in sight.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1240|issue=15092|date=22 December 1798}}</ref>

==British service==
The British took ''Go<U+00E9>land'' into service as ''Goelan''. Commander Thomas Wolley was appointed ''Goelan{{'}}''s captain at Jamaica.
 
In September 1793, at the request of French Royalists, Commodore John Ford took a squadron and attacked [[Saint-Domingue]] and [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>mie]] in the Caribbean.<ref>Clowes (1897-1903), Volume 4, p. 214.</ref> On 23 September 1793 the British captured four merchant vessels at L'Islet, and on the 29th seven at Flamande Bay. At [[M<U+00F4>le-Saint-Nicolas]], on 23 September, {{HMS|Europa|1783|2}}, ''Goelan'', and {{HMS|Flying Fish|1793|2}} captured the [[HMS Marie Antoinette (1793)|''Convention Nationale'']], among other vessels.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=570|issue=13901|date=14 June 1794}}</ref>

In December command passed to Lieutenant George Hopewell Stephens (temp), who sailed ''Goelan'' to Portsmouth, arriving on 27 August 1794.<ref name=Winfield/>

==Fate==
''Goelan'' was offered for sale at Sheerness in 1794.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1030|issue=13712|date=11 October 1794}}</ref> She was sold at Portsmouth on 16 October 1794 for <U+00A3>590. Her buyers renamed her ''The Brothers'' and used her in commerce.<ref name=Winfield/>
