'''''The Girl on the Boat''''' is a [[novel]] by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. The story first appeared as a serial in ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' in the [[United States]], under the title ''Three Men and a Maid'', from October to December [[1921]]. It was first published as a book in the U.S. on April 26, 1922 by [[George H. Doran]], [[New York]], and as '' The Girl on the Boat'' in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Barrie & Jenkins|Herbert Jenkins]], [[London]], on June 15 1922. 

The maid of the title is red-haired, dog-loving Wilhelmina "Billie" Bennet, and the three men are Bream Mortimer, a long-time friend and admirer of Billie, Eustace Hignett, a lily-livered poet who is engaged to Billie at the opening of the tale, and Sam Marlowe, Eustace's dashing cousin, who falls for Billie at first sight. All four find themselves on an [[ocean liner]] headed for [[England]] together, along with a capable young woman called Jane Hubbard who is smitten with Eustace, and typically Wodehousian romantic shenanigans ensue

A film adaptation was made in [[1961 in film|1961]], starring [[Norman Wisdom]] as Marlowe, [[Richard Briers]] as Eustace, [[Philip Locke]] as Bream Mortimer and [[Millicent Martin]] as Billie. Richard Briers later portrayed another Wodehouse character, [[Galahad Threepwood]], in a [[BBC]] adaptation of [[Heavy Weather (novel)|Heavy Weather]]. 

Directed by [[Henry Kaplan]] the screenplay was adapted from Wodehouse's original novel by [[Reuben Ship]]. Some scenes from the novel, such as Sam Marlowe's performance at the ship's concert, are not included in the film. The romance between Eustace and Jane Hubbard (played by [[Sheila Hancock]]) is also altered; Eustace stands up to his domineering mother in the film, but not in the book.
