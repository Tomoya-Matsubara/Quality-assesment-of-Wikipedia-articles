'''7&nbsp;World Trade Center''' is a building in [[New York City]] located across from the [[World Trade Center site]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. The name "7&nbsp;World Trade Center" has referred to two buildings: the original structure, completed in 1987, and the current structure. The original building was destroyed on [[Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Collapse_of_7_World_Trade_Center|September 11, 2001]] and replaced with the new 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, which opened in 2006.  Both buildings were developed by [[Larry Silverstein]], who holds a [[ground rent|ground lease]] for the site from the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].

The original 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was 47&nbsp;stories tall, clad in red exterior masonry, and occupied a [[trapezoid]]al footprint. An elevated walkway connected the building to the [[World Trade Center]] plaza.  The building was situated above a [[Consolidated Edison]] (Con Ed) power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints.  When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants.  In 1988, [[Salomon Brothers]] signed a long-term lease, and became the main tenants of the building. On [[September 11]], [[2001]], 7&nbsp;WTC was damaged by [[debris]] when the nearby North Tower of the [[collapse of the World Trade Center|WTC collapsed]]. Its structural integrity was further compromised by fires that burned throughout the afternoon and the building collapsed completely at 5:20&nbsp;p.m. Investigators are currently trying to determine exactly how the combination of local structural damage and fire caused the collapse of the whole structure. A final report is expected in or after July 2008.

The new 7&nbsp;World Trade Center construction began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. It is 52&nbsp;stories tall and still situated above the aforementioned power substation. Built on a smaller footprint than the original to allow [[Greenwich Street, Manhattan|Greenwich Street]] to be restored from [[TriBeCa]] through the World Trade Center site and south to [[Battery Park]], the new building is bounded by [[Greenwich Street (Manhattan)|Greenwich]], [[Vesey Street (Manhattan)|Vesey]], [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington]], and [[Barclay Street (Manhattan)|Barclay]] streets. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current 7&nbsp;World Trade Center's design placed emphasis on safety, with a [[reinforced concrete]] core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing of steel columns, and incorporates numerous [[environmentally friendly]] features.

The original 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was a 47-story building, designed by [[Emery Roth|Emery Roth & Sons]], with a red [[granite]] [[fa<U+00E7>ade]]. The building was 610&nbsp;feet (186&nbsp;m) tall, with a [[trapezoid]]al footprint that was 330&nbsp;ft (101&nbsp;m) long and 140&nbsp;ft (43&nbsp;m) wide.<ref name="NCSTAR 1-1-p13">{{cite book |title=Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Structural and Life Safety Systems (NCSTAR 1-1) |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) |pages=p. 13 |author=Lew, H.S., Richard W.

The structural design of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center included features to allow a larger building than originally planned to be constructed.  A system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders was located between floors&nbsp;5 and 7 to transfer loads to the smaller foundation.<ref name="NIST-june2004"/>  Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building.  The fifth floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the seventh floor, the building's structure was a typical tube-frame design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames.<ref name="salvarinas"/>

A shipping/receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern quarter of the 7&nbsp;World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the third floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp.<ref name="salvarinas">{{cite conference |author=Salvarinas, John J. |year=1986 |title=Seven World Trade Center, New York, Fabrication and Construction Aspects |booktitle=Proceedings of the 1986 Canadian Structural Engineering Conference |location=Vancouver |publisher=Canadian Steel Construction Council}}</ref> The spray-on [[fireproofing]] for structural steel elements was [[gypsum]]-based [[Monokote]] which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and truss, and a three-hour rating for columns.<ref name="fema-ch5"/>

Mechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven, including 12&nbsp;[[transformer]]s on the fifth floor. Several generators in the building were used by the Office of Emergency Management, Salomon Smith Barney and others.<ref name="fema-ch5"/> Storage tanks contained 24,000&nbsp;gallons (91,000&nbsp;L) of [[diesel]] fuel to supply the generators.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://fpemag.com/archives/article.asp?issue_id=14&i=183&p=1 |title=Study of Building Performance in the WTC Disaster |author=Milke, James |journal=Fire Protection Engineering |date=Spring 2003|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>  Fuel oil distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1-1J.pdf |format=pdf| title=Final Reports of the Federal Building and Fire Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster |chapter=NIST NCSTAR 1-1J: Documentation of the Fuel System for Emergency Power in World Trade Center 7 |month=September | year=2005 |author=Grill, Raymond A., Duane A.

In June 1986, before construction was completed, Silverstein signed [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] as a tenant to lease the entire 7&nbsp;World Trade Center building for $3&nbsp;billion over a term of 30&nbsp;years.<ref>
{{cite news |author=Scardino, Albert |title=A Realty Gambler's Big Coup |publisher=The New York Times |date=1986-07-11}}</ref>
In December 1986, after the [[Ivan Boesky|Boesky]] [[insider trading|insider-trading]] scandal, Drexel Burnham Lambert canceled the lease, leaving Silverstein to find other tenants.<ref>
{{cite news |author=Scardino, Albert |title=$3 Billion Office Pact Canceled by Drexel |publisher=The New York Times |date=1986-12-03}}</ref>
Spicer & Oppenheim agreed to lease 14&nbsp;percent of the space, but for more than a year, as [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and other factors adversely affected the [[Lower Manhattan]] real estate market, Silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space. By April 1988, Silverstein had lowered the rent and made other concessions.<ref>

In November 1988, [[Salomon Brothers]] withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at [[Columbus Circle]] in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and agreed to a 20-year lease for the top 19 floors of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center.<ref>
{{cite news |author=Berkowitz, Harry |title=Salomon to Move Downtown |publisher=Newsday |date=1988-11-29}}</ref>

Most of three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other floors, and more than 350&nbsp;tons (U.S.) of steel were added to construct three double-height trading floors. Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station. "Essentially, Salomon is constructing a building within a building - and it's an occupied building, which complicates the situation," said a district manager of [[Silverstein Properties]]. The unusual task was possible, said [[Larry Silverstein]], because it was designed to allow for "entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building's structural integrity, on the assumption that someone might need double-height floors."<ref name="Salomonsolution"/>

At the time of the [[September 11]], [[2001]] attacks, [[Salomon Smith Barney]] was by far the largest tenant in 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, occupying 1,202,900&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (111,750&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) (64&nbsp;percent of the building) which included floors 28<U+2013>45.<ref name="tenants">

===Collapse===

[[Image:Wtc7onfire.jpg|thumb|7 World Trade Center on fire after the collapse of the Twin Towers on 9/11]]

As the North Tower collapsed on [[September 11]], [[2001]], debris hit 7&nbsp;World Trade Center, causing heavy damage to the south face of the building.<ref name="NIST-june2004"/>  The bottom portion of the building's south face was heavily damaged by debris, including damage to the southwest corner from the 8th to 18th floors, a large vertical gash on the center-bottom extending at least ten floors, and other damage as high as the 18th floor.<ref name="NIST-june2004"/>  The building was equipped with a [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]], but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser; and the sprinkler system required some power for the [[fire pump]] to deliver water.  Also, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/media/P4InvestigationofActiveFireProtection.pdf|format=pdf  |title=Active Fire Protection Systems Issues |author=Grosshandler, William |publisher=NIST  |accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1-4.pdf |format=pdf|title=Active Fire Protection Systems |author=Evans, David D |publisher=NIST |month=September | year=2005 |accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref>

There were no [[casualty (person)|casualties]] associated with the collapse.

In May 2002, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] under leadership of Dr. [[W. Gene Corley]], P.E.  FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1&nbsp;WTC and 2&nbsp;WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting. According to FEMA, structural elements were exposed to high temperatures for a sufficient period of time to reduce their strength to the point of collapse<ref name="fema-ch5"/>; nevertheless, it has since been determined that the fires burned out in 20 minutes at any given location.<ref name="NIST Advisory Committee Dec 2007"/>

The report did not reach final conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation:

<blockquote>Loss of structural integrity was likely a result of weakening caused by fires on the 5th to 7th floors. The specifics of the fires in WTC&nbsp;7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence. Further research, investigation, and analyses are needed to resolve this issue. [Ch. 5, p. 31.]</blockquote>

NIST has released a video and still-photo analysis of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center before its collapse that appears to indicate a greater degree of structural damage from falling debris than originally assumed by FEMA. Specifically, NIST's interim report on 7&nbsp;World Trade Center displays photographs of the southwest fa<U+00E7>ade of the building that show it to have significant damage. The report also highlights a 10-story gash in the center of the south fa<U+00E7>ade, toward the bottom, extending approximately a quarter of the way into the interior.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1227842.html?page=5#wtc7 |title=Debunking the 9/11 Myths: Special Report |publisher=Popular Mechanics |month=March | year=2005|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref><ref name="NIST-june2004"/> A unique aspect of the design of 7&nbsp;World Trade Center was that each outer structural column was responsible for supporting 2,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (186&nbsp;m<U+00B2>) of floor space, suggesting that the simultaneous removal of a number of columns severely compromised the structure's integrity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/WTC%20Part%20IIC%20-%20WTC%207%20Collapse%20Final.pdf |format=pdf|title=NIST Response to the World Trade Center Disaster (Part IIC - WTC 7 Collapse) |date=2005-04-05 |publisher=NIST |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>  Consistent with this theory, news footage shows cracking and bowing of the building's east wall immediately before the collapse, which began at the penthouse floors.<ref name="NIST-june2004"/>  In video of the collapse, taken from the north by [[CBS News]] and other news media, the first visible sign of collapse is movement in the east penthouse 8.2&nbsp;seconds before the north wall began to collapse, which took at least another 7&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="NIST-june2004"/><ref>{{cite video |url=http://www.archive.org/details/cbs200109111651-1733 |people=CBS News |year=2001 |date=September 11 |title=CBS Sept. 11, 2001 4:51 pm - 5:33 pm (September 11, 2001) |publisher=[[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]], CBS 9, Washington, D.C |medium=Television}} - View [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k6GMddY-lQ footage] of the collapse captured by CBS</ref>

The collapse progressed vertically up to the east mechanical penthouse.  The interior structure was unable to handle the redistributed load, resulting in horizontal progression of the failure across lower floors, particularly the 5th to 7th floors.  This resulted in "a disproportionate collapse of the entire structure."<ref name="NIST7STAT1"/>
