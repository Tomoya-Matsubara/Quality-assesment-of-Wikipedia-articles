==Background==
On January 17, 2013, DJ Khaled announced that he had already started working on his seventh album and that it would be titled ''Suffering from Success''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapradar.com/2013/01/17/dj-khaled-names-next-album/ |title=DJ Khaled Names Next Album |publisher=Rap Radar |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}</ref> In January 2013, during an interview with [[MTV News]] DJ Khaled explained where the album title came from, saying: <blockquote>"We just got done turning in Ross<U+2019> album, and you know people don<U+2019>t realize, when you turn in an album, it<U+2019>s a lot of work behind the scenes; from clearing records, dealing with lawyers, sample clearances, mix and mastering, marketing plan. At that time, I<U+2019>m running around and I notice a big bald spot on my beard that kept getting bigger and bigger. I<U+2019>m acting like I don<U+2019>t want to see it, I<U+2019>m brushing it away and it kept getting it bigger and bigger. So When I finally got home off the road, I was like you know what, <U+2018>I<U+2019>m gonna go to the doctors.<U+2019> I don<U+2019>t like going to the doctors, so I go, and she<U+2019>s like it<U+2019>s a disorder that comes from your nerves and your stress, but she said <U+2018>I<U+2019>m going to give you medication, and I<U+2019>ll see you back in 4 months.<U+2019> Through that whole process while I<U+2019>m at the doctor<U+2019>s office, my phone<U+2019>s ringing, I<U+2019>m dealing with marketing people, I<U+2019>m dealing with lawyers, I<U+2019>m dealing with Ross, I<U+2019>m dealing with personal shit, a whole bunch of shit at the same time. It didn<U+2019>t stop, she<U+2019>s thinking I<U+2019>m crazy. So she gave me my medicine and all that, and she found out who I was, and after watching that 45 minute doctor<U+2019>s session, she grabbed my shoulder and she just goes, <U+2018>Son, you<U+2019>re suffering from success.<U+2019> I looked at her and was like, <U+2018>That might be the realest thing you can tell me, and it opened my mind up like, success comes with stress, and happiness. So Im driving home from the doctor<U+2019>s office and I<U+2019>m like, <U+201C>that<U+2019>s gonna be the name of my new album, ''Suffering From Success''.<U+2019>"<ref>{{cite web|author=00:00 |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dj-khaled-explains-album-title-suffering-from-success-news.4105.html |title=DJ Khaled Explains Album Title "Suffering From Success" |publisher=Hotnewhiphop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31}}</ref></blockquote> On June 10, 2013, it was announced that the album would be released on September 24, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1708726/dj-khaled-suffering-from-success-release-date.jhtml |title=DJ Khaled Reveals Release Date For Suffering From Success - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}</ref> On July 31, 2013, the album cover was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2013/07/31/album-cover-dj-khaled-suffering-from-success/ |title=Album Cover: DJ Khaled <U+2013> <U+2018>Suffering From Success<U+2019> |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date=2010-10-18 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}</ref> On August 26, 2013, DJ Khaled announced the album would be pushed back from September 24, 2013, until October 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapradar.com/2013/08/26/khaled-suffering-from-success-delayed/ |title=Khaled Suffering From Success Delayed |publisher=Rap Radar |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref>
