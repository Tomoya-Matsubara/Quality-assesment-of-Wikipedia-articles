'''Archipelago Sea Naval Command''' ({{lang-fi|Saaristomeren Meripuolustusalue}}, {{lang-sv|Sk<U+00E4>rg<U+00E5>rdshavets Marinkommando}}) is a [[Finnish Navy]] unit headquartered in [[Pansio]], [[Turku]]. Its main operating area is the [[Archipelago Sea]]. Archipelago Sea Naval Command was formed in 1998 by combining the [[Archipelago Sea Fleet]] and [[Turku Coastal Regiment]].

The main duty of the Archipelago Sea Naval Command during normal condition is the surveillance of Finnish [[territorial waters]] and maintaining territorial integrity. In addition, the Command trains conscripts to fulfil duties in the crisis-time organization of the Command. The Command is always at the state of enhanced readiness, prepared to repel unauthorized incursions to Finnish waters using force. In a crisis, securing the sea lanes for the use of Finnish commercial shipping would be the main duty of the Command.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/merivoimat/joukot/smmepa/esittelyt.dsp SMMEPA: Esittelyt].
