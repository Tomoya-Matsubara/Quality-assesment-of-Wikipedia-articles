'''''Personent hodie''''' is a [[Christmas carol]] originally published in the 1582 [[Finland|Finnish]] song book ''[[Piae Cantiones]]'', a volume of 74 Medieval songs with Latin texts collected by Jaakko Suomalainen, a Swedish [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] cleric, and published by T.P. Rutha.<ref name="AMG"/> The song book had its origins in the libraries of [[Cathedral school|cathedral song schools]], whose repertory had strong links with medieval [[Prague]], where [[Cleric|clerical]] students from Finland and Sweden had studied for generations.<ref name="MT"/> A melody found in a 1360 manuscript from the nearby [[Bavaria]]n city of [[Moosburg]] in Germany is highly similar, and it is from this manuscript that the song is usually dated.<ref name="Website">"On This Day Earth Shall Ring" at [http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/on_this_day_earth_shall_ring.htm hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com], URL accessed January 4, 2009</ref><ref>Gustav Holst, "''Personet hodie''" in the ''[[Oxford Book of Carols]]'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1928), p.171.</ref> 

==Textual origins==
The [[Latin]] text is probably a [[parody music|musical parody]] of an earlier 12th century song beginning "intonent hodie voces ecclesie", written in honour of [[Saint Nicholas]], the patron saint of Russia, sailors and children - to whom he traditionally brings gifts on his feast day, 6 December.<ref name="MT"/> Hugh Keyte and [[Andrew Parrott]] note that two of the verses have an unusual double repeat ('Submersum, -sum, -sum puerum'; 'Reddens vir-, vir-, vir- ginibus'). In 'intonent hodie', these were used to illustrate the three boys and three girls saved by St Nicholas from drowning and prostitution, respectively.<ref name="MT"/> The text was probably re-written for the [[Feast of the Holy Innocents]] (December 28) when choristers and their "[[boy bishop]]" traditionally displaced the senior clergy from the choir stalls.<ref name="Website"/> The carol is still often associated with Holy Innocents' Day.<ref name="AMG">Robert Cummings, "Personent hodie" at [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=42:89147 allmusic], URL accessed January 4, 2009</ref>

Songs from ''Piae Cantiones'' continued to be performed in Finland until the 19th Century.<ref name="OBC"/> The book became well known in Britain after a rare copy of ''Piae Cantiones'' owned by Peter of Nyland was given as a gift to the British Minister in [[Stockholm]]. He subsequently gave it to [[John Mason Neale]] in 1852, and it was from this copy that Neale, in collaboration with Thomas Helmore published songs in two collections in 1853 and 1854 respectively.<ref name="OBC">Ralph Vaughan Williams, Martin Shaw (ed.), note to J.M. Neale "January Carol" the ''[[Oxford Book of Carols]]'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1928), p.291.</ref>

==Translations==
The most common English translation of the text is by "James M. Joseph", a pseudonym of the composer Jane M. Joseph (1894-1929). She translates the title as '''''On this day earth shall ring''''', although there are several other English translations.<ref name="MT">Hugh Keyte, Andrew Parrott, "''Personent Hodie'', On This Day Earth Shall Ring" in ''[[The Musical Times]]'', Vol. 133, No. 1795 (September 1992), pp. 1-4</ref> Other versions include [[Elizabeth Poston]]'s 1965 "Boys' Carol", which translates the first line of the text as "Let the boys' cheerful noise/Sing today none but joys" and [[John Mason Neale]]'s "Let The Song be Begun", which uses the melody but not the text of the carol.<ref>[http://www.goldenhindmusic.com/lyrics/THEBOYSC.html The Boys' Carol] at Golden Hind Music, URL accessed January 4, 2009</ref><ref name="Website2">"Personent hodie" at [http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/NonEnglish/personent_hodie.htm hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com], URL accessed January 4, 2009</ref> Aidan Oliver's non-verse translation renders the text as "Today let the voices of children resound in joyful praise of Him who is born for us."<ref name="Kings"/> 

==Arrangements==
The carol became more prominent in England after being arranged for unison voices and orchestra in 1916 by [[Gustav Holst]] (1874-1934), where in its organ reduction it is often used as a [[processional]] hymn in church and cathedral services.<ref name="MT"/><ref name="AMG"/><ref>''[http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Personent_hodie_%28Gustav_Holst%29 Personent hodie]'' arranged by [[Gustav Holst]] at the [[Choral Public Domain Library]], URL accessed January 4, 2009</ref> Holst's version often forms part of the [[Nine Lessons and Carols|Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols]], and was last featured in the service from [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]] in 1998 following the eighth lesson.<ref name="Kings">[http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/ninelessons/1998/index.html#personent Nine Lessons and Carols 1998] order of service at the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]] website, URL accessed January 27, 2009</ref> This arrangement is sometimes referred to as "Theodoric" in reference to the composer's middle name (Theodore).<ref>[[Erik Routley]], ''An English-speaking Hymnal Guide'', (London: Liturgical Press, 1979), p.140</ref> 

In addition to Holst's version, there is a harmonised choral arrangement by Hugh Keyte and [[Andrew Parrott]] in the ''[[New Oxford Book of Carols]]'', an arrangement by Antony Pitts in the ''Naxos Book of Carols'' and two arrangements by [[John Rutter]]; one for choir and full orchestra which emulates percussive medieval instrumentation, and another in his anthology ''Dancing Day'' for female or boys voices with harp or piano accompaniment.<ref name="MT"/><ref>Antony Pitts, ''The Naxos Book of Carols'' (Faber Music, 2003)</ref><ref>John Rutter, ''[http://www.singers.com/composers/johnrutter.html Dancing Day]'' at singers.com, URL accessed January 4, 2009</ref> The Retrover Ensemble's performance for [[Naxos Records]] pairs the piece with ''[[Gaudete]]'', another carol from ''Piae Cantiones''.<ref>Markus Tapio, ''Piae Cantiones: Latin Song in Medieval Finland''. Naxos Records 8.554180</ref> 

There are also several recorded versions arranged in a more [[traditional music|folk]]-oriented style, for example a performance by [[Maddy Prior]] and [[The Carnival Band (folk group)|The Carnival Band]] on their 1987 album ''[[A Tapestry of Carols]]'', which utilises [[Historically informed performance|period instruments]].<ref>Brian Wilson, [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2008/Dec08/Tapestry_cdsdl366.htm Review of ''A Tapestry of Carols''] at MusicWeb, URL accessed January 27, 2009</ref> The female [[a cappella]] quartet [[Anonymous 4]] have also recorded the song with its original "Intonent hodie" text on their CD ''Legends of St. Nicholas''.<ref>Anonymous 4, ''[http://www.anonymous4.com/legtop.htm Legends of St. Nicholas]''. Harmonia Mundi HMU 907232</ref>

Robert Cummings, writing in the ''[[Allmusic]]'' guide, states that the "melody is glorious and ebullient in its lively, triumphant manner. It largely consists of bright, resolute three-note phrases whose overall structure gradually rises, then descends."<ref name="AMG"/>
