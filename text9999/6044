The '''Western Chalukya Empire''' ([[Kannada]]:'''{{lang|kn|<U+0CAA><U+0CB6><U+0CCD><U+0C9A><U+0CBF><U+0CAE> <U+0C9A><U+0CBE><U+0CB2><U+0CC1><U+0C95><U+0CCD><U+0CAF> <U+0CB8><U+0CBE><U+0CAE><U+0CCD><U+0CB0><U+0CBE><U+0C9C><U+0CCD><U+0CAF>}}''')  ruled most of the [[Deccan Plateau|western Deccan]], [[South India]], between the 10th and 12th centuries. This dynasty is sometimes called the ''Kalyani Chalukya'' after its regal capital at Kalyani, today's [[Basavakalyan]] in  [[Karnataka]] and alternatively  the ''Later Chalukya'' from its theoretical relationship to the sixth century [[Chalukya dynasty]] of [[Badami]]. The dynasty is called Western Chalukyas to differentiate from the contemporaneous [[Eastern Chalukyas]] of [[Vengi]], a separate dynasty. Prior to the rise of these Chalukyas, the [[Rashtrakuta]] empire of [[Manyakheta]] controlled most of deccan and central India for over two centuries. In 973, seeing confusion in the Rashtrakuta empire after a successful invasion of their capital by the [[Paramara]] of [[Malwa]], [[Tailapa II]] a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from [[Bijapur District|Bijapur]] region defeated his overlords and made Manyakheta his capital. The dynasty quickly rose to power and grew into an empire under [[Somesvara I]] who moved the capital to Kalyani. 

For over a century, the two empires of southern India, the Western Chalukyas and the [[Chola dynasty]] of [[Tanjore]] fought many fierce wars to control the fertile region of [[Vengi]]. During these conflicts, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, distant cousins of the Western Chalukyas but related to the Cholas by marriage took sides with the Cholas enabling Cholas domination in the region.<ref name="conquer1"/><ref name="conquer"/><ref name="chopra"/><ref name="sen"/> Vast areas between  the [[Narmada River]] in the north and [[Kaveri River]] in the south came under Chalukya control. During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the [[Hoysalas]], the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]], the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] and the Southern [[Kalachuri]], were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned  during the later half of the twelfth century.

The Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style  known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in  central Karnataka. Well known examples are the [[Kasivisvesvara Temple]] at [[Lakkundi]], the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatii, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali and the [[Mahadeva Temple (Itagi)|Mahadeva Temple]] at Itagi. This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of [[Kannada]], and [[Sanskrit]].

Knowledge of the Western Chalukyas history has come  through examination of the numerous excavated Kannada language [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] left by the kings and from the study of important contemporary literary documents in [[Western Chalukya literature]] such as ''Gada Yuddha'' (982) in Kannada by [[Ranna]] and ''Vikramankadeva Charitam'' (1120) in Sanskrit by [[Bilhana]].<ref name="source1">Kamath (2001), pp10<U+2013>12, p100</ref><ref name="source">{{cite web|title=Kannada inscriptions|url=http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_9/chalukyas_of_kalyani.html|author=Sastry, Shama & Rao, N.

One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami [[Chalukya]] dynasty of sixth century<ref name="related">Poet [[Bilhana]]s 12th century Sanskrit work '' Vikramadeva Charitam'' and [[Ranna]]'s Kannada work ''Gadayuddha'' (982) and inscriptions from Nilagunda, Yevvur, Kauthem and Miraj claim Tailapa II was son of Vikramaditya IV, seventh in descent from Bhima, brother of Badami Chalukya [[Vikramaditya II]] (Kamath 2001, p100)</ref><ref name="Malla">Kings of the Chalukya line of [[Vemulavada]], who were certainly from the Badami Chalukya family line used the title "Malla" which is often used by the Western Chalukyas. Names such as "Satyasraya" which were used by the Badami Chalukya are also name of a Western Chalukya king, (Gopal B.R. in Kamath 2001, p100)</ref> while  other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the early Chalukyas.<ref name="unrelated">Unlike the Badami Chalukyas, the Kalyani Chalukyas did not claim to be ''Harithiputhras'' of ''Manavysya gotra'' in lineage. The use of titles like ''Tribhuvanamalla'' marked them of as a distinct line (Fleet, Bhandarkar and Altekar in Kamath 2001, p100)</ref>  

Inscriptional evidence suggests a possible rebellion by a local Chalukya King, Chattigadeva of [[Banavasi]]-12000 province (967), in alliance with local Kadamba chieftains. This rebellion however was unfruitful but paved the way for his successor Tailapa II.<ref name="chatta">Moraes (1931), pp88-93</ref> A few years later, Tailapa II re-established Chalukya rule and defeated the Rashtrakutas during the reign of [[Karka II]] by timing his  rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused in the Rashtrakuta capital of Manyakheta by the invading [[Paramara]]s of Central India in 973.<ref name="coincide">Later legends and tradition hailed Tailapa as an incarnation of the God [[Krishna]] who fought 108 battles against the race of Ratta (Rashtrakuta) and captured 88 fortresses from them (Sastri 1955, p162)</ref><ref name="coincide1">According to a 973 inscription, Tailapa II helped by Kadambas of [[Hangal]], destroyed the Rattas (Rashtrakutas), killed the valiant Munja (Paramara kingdom), took the head of Panchala (Ganga dynasty) and restored the royal dignity of the Chalukyas (Moraes 1931, pp 93<U+2013>94)</ref> After overpowering the Rashtrakutas, Tailapa II moved his capital to Manyakheta and consolidated the Chalukya empire in the western deccan by subjugating the [[Paramara]] and other aggressive rivals and extending his control over the land between the Narmada River and Tungabhadra River.<ref name="claim">Sastri (1955), p164</ref> However, some inscriptions indicate that Balagamve in Mysore territory may have been a power centre up to the rule of Somesvara I in 1042.<ref name="bala">A minor capital of Jayasimha II (Cousens 1926, p10, p105)</ref>

The  intense competition between the kingdoms of the western deccan and those of the [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamil kingdoms]] came to the fore in the eleventh century over the acutely contested fertile river valleys in the [[doab]] region of the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Godavari River]] called [[Vengi]] (coastal [[Andhra Pradesh]]). The Western Chalukyas and the [[Chola Dynasty]] fought many bitter wars over control of this strategic resource. The imperial Cholas gained power during the time of the famous king [[Rajaraja Chola I]] and the crown prince [[Rajendra Chola I]].<ref name="ascend">King Rajaraja Chola conquered parts of Chalukya territory in present day South Karnataka by subjugating the Western Ganga Dynasty of [[Mysore State|Gangavadi]] (Kamath 2001, p102)</ref> The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi were cousins of the Western Chalukyas but became increasingly influenced by the Cholas through their marital ties with the Tamil kingdom. As this was against the interests of the Western Chalukyas, they wasted no time in involving themselves politically and militarily in Vengi. When King [[Satyasraya]] succeeded Tailapa II to the throne, he was struggling but was able to protect his kingdom from Chola aggression as well as his northern territories in [[Konkan]] and [[Gujarat]] although his control over Vengi was nullified.<ref name="satya">From the Hottur inscriptions dated 1007 <U+2013> 1008, Satyasraya was able to tackle the crown prince Rajendra Chola (Kamath 2001, p102)</ref> His successor, [[Jayasimha II]], fought many battles with the Cholas in the south while both powerful kingdoms vying for control over Vengi.<ref name="choice">Jayasimha's choice of Vengi's king was Vijayaditya VII while the Cholas sought to place [[Rajaraja Narendra]], son-in-law of Rajendra Chola I (Kamath 2001, p102</ref> Jayasimha II  subdued the [[Paramara]] of central India.

It is known from records that Jayasimha's son, [[Somesvara I]], moved the Chalukya capital to Kalyani in 1042<ref name="movedcapital">Quote:"Beautified it so that it surpassed all the other cities of the earth" (Cousens 1926, p10)</ref> after getting defeated by the Cholas not less than 5 times and lost some crucial territories<ref name="territory">Ganguli in Kamath 2001, p103</ref><ref name="territory1">Sastri (1955), p166</ref> during the ongoing politics of installing a puppet on the Vengi throne.<ref name="puppet">Somesvara I supported the cause of Shaktivarman II, son of Vijayaditya II while the Cholas preferred Rajendra, son of the previous king Rajaraja Narendra (Kamath 2001, p103)</ref><ref name="puppet1">Sastri (1955), p169</ref> In 1068 Somesvara I, suffering from an incurable illness, drowned himself in the Tungabhadra River (''Paramayoga'').<ref name="suicide">Kamath (2001), p104</ref><ref name="suicide1">Sastri (1955), p170</ref><ref name="drowned">Cousens (1926), pp10<U+2013>11</ref> while some argue that the cause of suicide might be humiliation of defeats. Despite many conflicts with the Cholas in the south, Somesvara I had managed to maintain control over the northern territories in [[Konkan]], Gujarat, [[Malwa]] and [[Kalinga]] during his rule. His successor, his eldest son [[Somesvara II]], feuded with his younger brother, [[Vikramaditya VI]], an ambitious warrior who had initially been governor of [[Mysore State|Gangavadi]] in the southern deccan when Somesvara II was the king. Married to a Chola princess (a daughter of Virarajendra Chola), Vikramaditya VI maintained a friendly alliance with them. After the death of the Chola king in 1070, Vikramaditya VI invaded the Tamil kingdom and installed  his brother-in-law, [[Athirajendra Chola|Adhirajendra]] Chola, on the throne.<ref name="adhirajendra">Sastri (1955), p171</ref> At the same time Vikramaditya VI undermined his brother, Somesvara II, by winning the loyalty of the Chalukya feudatories: the Hoysala, the Seuna and the [[Kadambas]] of Hangal. Anticipating a civil war, Somesvara II sought help from Vikramaditya VI's enemies, Kulothunga Chola I and the Kadambas of [[Goa]]. In the ensuing conflict of 1076, Vikramaditya VI emerged victorious and proclaimed himself king of the Chalukya empire.<ref name="proclaim">Sastri 1955, p172</ref><ref name="proclaim1">Eulogising Vikramaditya VI, Kashmiri poet Bilhana wrote in his ''Vikramanakadeva Charita'' that lord Shiva himself advised Chalukya Vikramaditya VI to replace his elder brother from the throne (Thapar 2003, p468)</ref>

The fifty year reign of Vikramaditya VI, the most successful of the later Chalukya rulers, was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to by historians as the "Chalukya Vikrama era".<ref name="varsha">Vikramaditya VI abolished the ''saka'' era and established the ''Vikrama-varsha'' (Vikrama era).

The continual warring with the Cholas exhausted the empire, giving their subordinates the  opportunity to rebel.<ref name="exhaust">Their feudatories, Hoysalas of Mysore region, Kakatiyas of Warangal, Seunas of Devagiri wasted no time in seizing the opportunity, (Sastri 1955,p158)</ref> In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command.<ref name="demand">Sastri (1955), p176</ref> The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other.

Seeing decadence and uncertainty seeping into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Seunas]] also encroached upon the empire. In any case, in the internecine wars among the small Kannada kingdoms of the Kadambas, Hoysalas, Vaidumbas or Kalachuris, the Chalukya interference was to cause them dearly with these Kingdoms steadily increasing their stock and ultimately the Hoysalas, the Kakatiyas, the Kalachuris and the Seunas consuming the Chalukyas and sending them into oblivion.<ref name=sastri>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'',</ref> With the [[Kalachuris]] occupying the Chalukyan capital for over 35 years followed around AD 1149, after the defeat of [[Tailapa III]] by the occupation of Dharwar in North Central Karnataka by the [[Hoysalas]] under [[Vishnuvardhana]] where he based himself with his son [[Narasimha I]] in-charge at the [[Hoysala]] capital Dwarasamudra  the Chalukya kingdom was already starting to dissolve, mainly due to incompetency of its rulers after 1120 AD.  Hoysala [[Narasimha I]] defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region. In 1157 the [[Kalachuri]]s under [[Bijjala II]] captured Kalyani and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to Annigeri in the present day [[Dharwad district]].<ref name="demand"/>

Bijjala II's Chikkalagi record of 1157 calls him ''Mahabhujabala Chakravarti'' ("emperor with powerful shoulders and arms") indicating he no longer was a subordinate of the Chalukyas.<ref name="bhuja">Kamath (2001), p108</ref> However the successors of Bijjala II were unable to hold on to Kalyani and their rule ended in 1183 when the last Chalukya scion, [[Somesvara IV]] made a final bid to regain the empire by recapturing Kalyani.<ref name="annigeri"/> Kalachuri King Sankama was killed by Chalukya general Narasimha in this conflict.<ref name="bijj">From the Minajagi record of 1184 (Kamath 2001, p109)</ref><ref name="desert">A Kalachuri commander called Barmideva or Brahma is known to have given support to the Chalukyas (Sastri 1955, p179<U+2013>180)</ref> During this time, Hoysala [[Veera Ballala II]] was growing ambitious and clashed on several occasions with the Chalukyas and the other claimants over their empire. He defeated Chalukya Somesvara IV and Seuna Bhillama V bringing large regions in the Krishna River valley under the Hoysala domains, but was unsuccessful against Kalachuris.<ref name="virabal">Kamath (2001), p127</ref> The Seunas under Bhillama V were on an imperialistic expansion too when the Chalukyas regained Kalyani. Their ambitions were temporarily stemmed by their defeat against Chalukya general Barma in 1183 but they later had their vengeance in 1189. 

The Cholas under [[Kulothunga Chola III]] even collaborated to the herald the dissolution of the [[Chalukyas]] by aiding [[Hoysalas]] under [[Veera Ballala II]], the son-in-law of the Chola monarch, and sounded the death-knell of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in a series of wars with [[Somesvara IV]] between 1185-1190 AD, the last Chalukya king whose territories did not even include the erstwhile Chalukyan capitals Badami, Manyakheta or Kalyani. That was the final dissolution of Chalukyan power<ref name=sastri180>[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p. 180</ref> though the [[Chalukyas]] existed only in name since 1135-1140.

Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p.179</ref>

The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in [[Banavasi]] 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.<ref name="banavasi">Sastri (1955), p180</ref>

== Administration ==
[[Image:Mallikarjuna group of temples at Badami.jpg|thumb|right|Mallikarjuna group of temples at [[Badami]] in [[Bagalkot district]], Karnataka]]
The Western Chalukya kingship was hereditary, passing to the king's brother if the king did not have a male heir. The administration was highly decentralised and  feudatory clans such as the [[Alupas]], the Hoysalas, the Kakatiya, the Seuna, the southern Kalachuri and others were allowed to rule their autonomous provinces, paying an annual tribute to the Chalukya emperor.<ref name="admin">Kamath (2001), p110</ref> Excavated inscriptions record titles such as ''Mahapradhana'' (Chief minister), ''Sandhivigrahika'', and ''Dharmadhikari'' (chief justice). Some positions such as ''Tadeyadandanayaka'' (commander of reserve army) were specialised in function while  all ministerial positions included the role of ''Dandanayaka'' (commander), showing that cabinet members were trained as army commanders as well as in general administrative skills.<ref name="danda">Kamath (2001), p109</ref>

The kingdom was divided into provinces such as ''Banavasi-12000'', ''Nolambavadi-32000'', ''Gangavadi-96000'', each name including the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in ''Belavola-300''. The big provinces were called ''Mandala'' and under them were ''Nadu'' further divided into  ''Kampanas'' (groups of villages) and finally a ''Bada'' (village). A ''Mandala'' was under a member of the royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. [[Tailapa II]] himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the [[Rashtrakuta]] rule. Chiefs of ''Mandalas'' were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Somesvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered ''Nadus'' and ''Kampanas''. Army commanders were titled ''Mahamandaleshwaras'' and those who headed a ''Nadu'' were entitled ''Nadugouvnda''.<ref name="admin1">There was flexibility to the terms used to designate territorial division (Dikshit G.S. in Kamath 2001, p110)</ref>

Agriculture was the empire's main source of income through taxes on land and produce. The  majority of the people lived in villages and worked farming the  staple crops of rice, [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]], and cotton in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with  [[areca]] and [[betel]] being the chief cash crops.  The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If  peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.<ref name="pheasant">Thapar (2002), p373</ref> 

Taxes were levied on mining and forest products, and additional income was raised through tolls for the use of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines.<ref name="fine">Thapar (2002), p378</ref> Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities  (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce  (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.<ref name="soil">Sastri (1955), p298</ref>

Key figures mentioned in inscriptions from rural areas were the Gavundas (officials) or [[Gowda|Goudas]].  The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the ''Praja Gavunda'' (people's Gavunda) and the ''[[Prabhu]] Gavunda'' (lord of Gavundas). They served the dual purpose of representing  the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are mentioned in inscriptions related to land transactions, irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and  village council  duties.<ref name="gowda">Thapar (2002), p379</ref>

The organisation of corporate enterprises became common in  the 11th century.<ref name="enterprise">Thapar (2002), p382</ref> Almost all arts and crafts were organised into guilds and work was done on a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the  Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names below their creations.<ref name="anon">Sastri (1955), p299</ref>
Merchants organised themselves into powerful guilds that  transcended political divisions, allowing their operations to be largely unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat  was the possibility of theft from [[Piracy|brigands]] when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds  included the ''[[Manigramam]]'', the ''[[Nagarattar]]'' and the ''[[Anjuvannam]]''. Local guilds  were called ''nagaram'', while the ''[[Nanadesis]]''  were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self styled ''[[Ainnurruvar]]'', also known as the 500 ''Svamis'' of Ayyavolepura ([[Brahmins]] and ''[[Mahajanas]]'' of present day [[Aihole]]),<ref name="merhant">Sastri (1955), p300</ref><ref name="merchant1">Thapar (2002), p384</ref>  who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby  contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations  (''Vira Bananjudharma'' or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] called ''Prasasti''. Five hundred such excavated ''Prasasti'' inscriptions, with their own flag and the bull as their emblem, record their pride in their business. 

Rich traders  contributed significantly to the king's treasury through paying import and export taxes. The edicts of the Aihole ''Svamis'' mention trade ties with foreign kingdoms such as [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], [[Pandya]], Maleya ([[Malayasia]]), [[Magadh]], [[Kaushal]], [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], [[Kurumba]], Kambhoja ([[Cambodia]]), Lata ([[Gujarat]]), Parasa ([[Persia]]) and [[Nepal]]. Travelling both land and sea routes, these merchants traded mostly in precious stones, spices and perfumes, and other specialty items such as camphor. Business flourished in precious stones such as diamonds, [[lapis lazuli]], [[onyx]], [[topaz]], [[Carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncles]] and [[emeralds]]. Commonly traded spices were cardamom, saffron, and cloves,  while perfumes included the by-products of sandalwood, [[bdellium]], musk, [[civet]] and rose. These items were sold either in bulk or hawked on streets by local merchants in towns.<ref name="hawk">Sastri (1955), 301</ref> The Western Chalukyas controlled most of South India's west coast and by the 10th century they had established extensive trade ties with the [[Tang Empire]] of [[China]], the empires of [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Abbasid|Abbasid Caliphate]] in [[Bhagdad]], and by the 12th century Chinese fleets were frequenting Indian ports. Exports to [[Song Dynasty]] China included textiles, spices, medicinal plants, jewels, ivory, rhino horn, ebony and camphor. The same products also reached ports in the west such as [[Dhofar]] and [[Aden]]. The final destinations for those trading with the west were Persia, Arabia and Egypt.<ref name="siraf">Thapar (2002), 383</ref>  The thriving trade center of [[Siraf]], a port on the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf, served an international clientele of merchants  including those from the Chalukya empire who were feasted by wealthy local merchants during business visits.   An indicator of the Indian merchants' importance in Siraf comes from  records describing  dining plates reserved for them.<ref name=">Sastri (1955), p302</ref>  In addition to this, Siraf received [[aloe]] wood, perfumes, sandalwood and condiments. The most expensive import to South India were Arabian horse shipments, this  trade being monopolised by Arabs and local Brahmin merchants. Thirteenth century traveler [[Marco Polo]] recorded that the breeding of horses never succeeded in India  due to differing climatic, soil and grassland conditions.<ref name="siraf"/>

The fall of the Rashtrakuta empire to the Western Chalukyas in the tenth century,  coinciding with the defeat of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] by the Cholas  in [[Mysore State|Gangavadi]], was a setback to [[Jainism]]. The growth of [[Virashaivism]] in the Chalukya territory and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava Hinduism]] in the Hoysala region paralleled a general decreased interest in Jainism, although the succeeding kingdoms continued to be religiously tolerant.<ref name="jainsim">Kamath (2001), p112, p132</ref> Two locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory continued to be patronaged, [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The decline of Buddhism in South India had begun in the 8th century with the spread of [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita]] philosophy.<ref name="buddhist">A 16th century Buddhist work by Lama Taranatha speaks disparagingly of Shankaracharya as close parallels in some beliefs of Shankaracharya with Buddhist philosophy was not viewed favourably by Buddhist writers (Thapar,  2003, pp 349<U+2013>350, p397)</ref> The only places of Buddhist worship that remained during the Western Chalukya rule were at [[Dambal]] and [[Balligavi]].<ref name="buddha">An inscription dated 1095 CE of Vikramaditya VI mentions  grants to a ''Vihara'' of Buddha and Arya-Taradevi (Cousens 1926, p11)</ref> There is no mention of religious conflict in the writings and inscriptions of the time which suggest the religious transition was smooth.

Although the origin of the Virashaiva faith has been debated, the movement grew through its association with [[Basavanna]] in the twelfth century.<ref name="basava">It is said five earlier saints Renuka, Daruka, Ekorama, Panditharadhya and Vishwaradhya were the original founders of Virashaivism (Kamath 2001, p152)</ref><ref name="basava1">However it is argued that these saints were from the same period as Basavanna (Sastri 1955, p393)</ref> Basavanna and other Virashaiva saints preached of  a faith without a [[caste system]]. In his [[Vachanas]] (a form of poetry), Basavanna appealed to the masses in simple Kannada and wrote "work is worship" (Kayakave Kailasa). Also known as the [[Lingayats]] (worshipers of the ''Linga'', the universal symbol of Shiva), these Virashaivas questioned many of the established norms of society such as the belief in rituals and the theory of rebirth and supported the remarriage of widows and the  marriage of unwed older women.<ref name="remarriage">Thapar (2003), p399</ref> This gave more social freedom to women but they were not accepted into the priesthood. [[Ramanujacharya]], the head of the Vaishnava monastery in [[Srirangam]], traveled to the Hoysala territory and preached the way of devotion ([[bhakti|bhakti marga]]). He later wrote ''Sribhashya'', a commentary on Badarayana [[Brahmasutra]], a critique on the [[Advaita]] philosophy of Adi Shankara.<ref name="mayavada">He criticised Adi Shankara as a "Buddhist in disguise" (Kamath 2001, p151)</ref> Ramanujacharya's stay in [[Melkote]] resulted in the Hoysala King [[Vishnuvardhana]] converting to Vaishnavism, a faith that his successors also followed.

The impact of these religious developments on the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of metaphysics and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written over the next centuries. [[Akka Mahadevi]], [[Allama Prabhu]], and a host of Basavanna's followers, including Chenna Basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, and Kondaguli Kesiraja wrote hundreds of poems called [[Vachanas]] in praise of [[Lord Shiva]].<ref name="vira">Narasimhacharya (1988), p20</ref> The esteemed scholars in the Hoysala court, [[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]] and [[Raghavanka]], were Virashaivas.<ref name="veer">Sastri (1955), p361<U+2013>362</ref> This tradition continued into the [[Vijayanagar empire]] with such well known scholars as Singiraja, Mallanarya, Lakkana Dandesa and other prolific writers of Virashaiva literature.<ref name="lakkanna">Kamath (2001), p182</ref><ref name="Jakkanna">Narasimhacharya (1988), p22</ref> The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanujacharya exists today in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara.<ref name="ramanuja">Mack (2001), pp35<U+2013>36</ref> Scholars in the succeeding Mysore Kingdom wrote Vaishnavite works supporting the teachings of Ramanujacharya.<ref name="mysore">Kamath (2001), p152</ref> King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism.<ref name="vishnu">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Temples of Belur |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/hoysala/belur.htm|author=Kamath K.L., November 04,2006 |publisher=<U+00A9> 1996<U+2013>2006 Kamat's Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref>

The rise of [[Veerashaiva]]ism was revolutionary and challenged the prevailing [[Hindu caste system]] which retained royal support. The social role of women largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and [[Kalachuri]] queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty [[Vachana]] women poets included the work of the 12th century [[Virashaiva]] mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the ''[[bhakti]]'' movement is well known.<ref name="mystic">She was not only a pioneer in the era of Women's emancipation but also an example of a transcendental world-view (Thapar 2003, p392)</ref> Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals.<ref name="wars">Sastri (1955), p286</ref><ref name="emancipation">This is in stark contrast to the literature of the time (like Vikramankadeva Charita of Bilhana) that portrayed women as retiring, overly romantic and unconcerned with affairs of the state (Thapar 2003, p392)</ref> Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to [[Self-immolation|immolate]] herself on her husband<U+2019>s funeral [[pyre]]) though present was on a voluntary basis.<ref name="sati">The Belathur inscription of 1057 describes the end of a widow called Dekabbe who committed Sati despite the requests of her parents not to while some widows such as Chalukya queen Attimabbe long survived their deceased husbands (Kamath 2001, pp 112<U+2013>113)</ref> Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the [[Jainism|Jains]] who preferred to fast to death ([[Sallekhana]]), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (''Shoolabrahma'') or walking into fire on an eclipse.

In a Hindu caste system that was conspicuously present, [[Brahmin]]s enjoyed a privileged position as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning with the exception of a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins  were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (''Panchayat'').<ref name="panchayat">The intellectual qualifications of the Brahmins made them apt to serve as ministers and advisers of Kings(''Rajguru''), (Charles Eliot in Sastri 1955, p289)</ref> 

Regarding eating habits, Brahmins, Jains, Buddhists and Shaivas were strictly vegetarian while the partaking of different kinds of meat was popular among other communities. Marketplace vendors sold meat from domesticated animals such as goats, sheep, pigs and fowl as well as exotic meat including partridge, hare, wild fowl and boar.<ref name="fowl">Sastri (1955), p288</ref> People found indoor amusement by attending wrestling matches (''Kusti'') or watching animals fight such as cock fights and ram fights or by gambling. Horse racing was a popular outdoor past time.<ref name="cock">Sastri (1955), p289</ref> In addition to these leisurely activities, festivals and fairs were frequent and  entertainment by traveling troupes of acrobats, dancers, dramatists and musicians was often provided.<ref name="games">The ''Manasollasa'' written by King [[Somesvara III]] contains significant information of the social life of Western Chalukyan times (Kamath 2001, p112)</ref>

Schools and hospitals are mentioned in records and these were built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to sing in choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu ''[[Matha]]'', Jain ''Palli'' and Buddhist ''[[Vihara]]''.<ref name="choir">Orchestras were popularised by the Kalamukhas, a cult who worshipped Lord Shiva (Kamath 2001, p115)</ref> These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries (''Saraswati Bhandara''). Learning was imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called ''Brahmapuri'' (or ''Ghatika'' or ''Agrahara''). Teaching Sanskrit was a near monopoly of Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of subjects taught varied from four to eighteen.<ref name="subjects">Sastri (1955), p292</ref> The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics (''Vartta''), Political Science (''Dandaniti''), Veda (''trayi'') and Philosophy (''Anvikshiki''), subjects that are mentioned as early as [[Kautilya]]s [[Arthasastra]].

=== Literature ===
{{main|Kannada literature in the Western Chalukya Empire}}
[[Image:Tripurantakesvara Temple Sculpture and Grill work at Balligavi.jpg|thumb||right|Grill work at Tripurantkesvara temple in Balligavi, Shimoga district]]
The Western Chalukya era was a time of substantial literary activity in Kannada and Sanskrit.<ref name="sub">Kamath (2001), p114</ref> In a golden age of Kannada literature, [[Jain]] scholars wrote about the life of [[Tirthankaras]] and [[Virashaiva]] poets expressed their closeness to God through pithy poems called [[Vachanas]]. More than two hundred contemporary ''Vachanakaras'' (''Vachana'' poets) including thirty women poets have been recorded.<ref name="kara">Sastri (1955), p361</ref> Early works by [[Brahmin]] writers were on the epics, [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Bhagavata]], [[Puranas]] and [[Vedas]]. In the field of secular literature, subjects such as romance, erotics, medicine, lexicon, astrology, encyclopedia etc. were written for the first time.<ref name="asro">Narasimhacharya (1988), pp18<U+2013>20</ref><ref name="early"/> 

Most notable among Kannada scholars were [[Ranna]], grammarian [[Nagavarma II]] and Virashaiva saint Basavanna. Ranna who was patronised by king Tailapa II and Satyasraya is one among the "three gems of Kannada literature".<ref name="gems">The other two gems are [[Adikavi Pampa]] and [[Sri Ponna]] (Sastri 1955, p356)</ref> He was bestowed the title "Emperor among poets" (''Kavi Chakravathi'') by King Tailapa II and has five major works to his credit. Of these, ''Saahasabheema Vijayam'' (or ''Gada yuddha'') of 982 in ''Champu'' style is a eulogy of his patron King Satyasraya whom he compares to Bhima in valour and achievements and narrates the duel between [[Bhima]] and [[Duryodhana]] using clubs on the eighteenth day of the [[Kurukshetra War|Mahabharata war]].<ref name="champu">A composition written in a mixed prose-verse style is called Champu (Narasimhacharya 1988, p12)</ref> He wrote ''[[Ajitha purana]]'' in 993 describing the life of the second [[Tirthankara]], Ajitanatha.<ref name="atti">This also is in ''Champu'' style and was written at the request of Attimabbe, a pious widow of general Nagavarma who promoted the cause of Jainism (Sastri 1955, p356)</ref><ref name="ajit">E.P.Rice (1921), p32</ref> 

Nagavarma II, poet laureate (''Katakacharya'') of King Jagadhekamalla II made contributions to Kannada literature in various subjects.<ref name="kataka">Narasimhacharya (1988), pp64<U+2013>65,</ref><ref name="naga">E.P.Rice (1921), p34</ref> His works in poetry, prosody, grammar and vocabulary are standard authorities and their importance to the study of Kannada language is well acknowledged. ''Kavyavalokana'' in poetics, ''Karnataka-Bhashabhushana'' on grammar and ''Vastukosa'' a lexicon (with Kannada equivalents for Sanskrit words) are some of his comprehensive contributions.<ref name="vastu">Nagavarma II was the teacher (''guru'') of another noteworthy scholar [[Janna]] who later adorned the court of [[Hoysala Empire]] (Sastri 1955, p358)</ref>

A unique and native form of poetic literature in Kannada called [[Vachanas]] developed during this time. They were written by mystics, who expressed their devotion to God in simple poems that could appeal to the masses. Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu are the best known among them.<ref name="vachana">Vachanas are disconnected paragraphs ending with a name attributed to lord [[Shiva]] or one of his forms. The poems teach the valuelessness of riches, rituals and book learning and the spiritual privileges of worshipping Shiva, (B.L. Rice in Sastri 1955, p361)</ref> 

In Sanskrit, a well known poem (''[[Mahakavya]]'') in 18 cantos called ''Vikramankadeva Charita'' by Kashmiri poet [[Bilhana]] recounts in epic style the life and achievements of his patron king Vikramaditya VI. The work narrates the episode of Vikramaditya VI's accession to the Chalukya throne after overthrowing his elder brother Somesvara II.<ref name="karnata">Thapar (2003), p394</ref>

''Manasollasa'' or ''Abhilashitartha Chintamani'' by king [[Somesvara III]] (1129) was a Sanskrit work intended for all sections of society. This is an example of an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit covering many subjects including medicine, magic, veterinary science, valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting, music, games, amusements etc.<ref name="encyclo">Thapar, (2003), p393</ref> While the book does not give any of dealt topics particular hierarchy of importance, it serves as a landmark in understanding the state of knowledge in those subjects at that time.<ref name="dance">Sastri (1955), p315</ref> 

A Sanskrit scholar [[Vijnaneshwara]] became famous in the field of legal literature for his ''[[Mitakshara]]'', in the court of Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the most acknowledged work in that field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on ''Yajnavalkya'') based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of modern India. An [[Englishman]] Colebrooke later translated into [[English language|English]] the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system.<ref name="court">Sastri (1955), p324</ref> Some important literary works of the time related to music and musical instruments were ''Sangita Chudamani'', ''Sangita Samayasara'' and ''Sangita Ratnakara''.<ref name="instrument">''Sangita Ratnakara'' being written in the court of feudatory [[Seuna]] kingdom, (Kamath 2001, p115)</ref>

The local language Kannada was mostly used in Western (Kalyani) Chalukya inscriptions and epigraphs. Some historians assert that ninety percent of their inscriptions are in the Kannada language while the remaining are in Sanskrit language.<ref name="percent">Pollock (2006), p332</ref><ref name="percent1">Houben(1996), p215 </ref> More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the twelfth century,<ref name="sources1">Thousands of Kannada language inscriptions are ascribed by Vikramaditya VI and pertain to his daily land and charitable grants (''Nityadana''),{{cite web|title=Chalukyas of Kalyana |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/deckings.htm|author=Kamat, Jyotsna|publisher=1996<U+2013>2006 Kamat's Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref> many of which have been deciphered and translated by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India.<ref name="source"/> Inscriptions were generally either on stone (''Shilashasana'') or copper plates (''Tamarashasana''). This period saw the growth of Kannada as a language of literature and poetry, impetus to which came from the devotional movement of the Virashaivas (called [[Lingayatism]]) who expressed their closeness to their deity in the form of simple lyrics called Vachanas.<ref name="devotion">Kannada enjoyed patronage from royalty, influential Jains and the [[Lingayat]] movement of Virashaivas (Thapar 2003, p396)</ref> At an administrative level, the regional language was used to record locations and rights related to land grants. When bilingual inscriptions were written, the section stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without any ambiguity.<ref name="bilingual">However by the 14th century, bilingual inscriptions lost favour and inscriptions became mostly in the local language (Thapar, 2003, pp393<U+2013>95)</ref> 

In addition to inscriptions, chronicles called ''Vamshavalis'' were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, writings on secular subjects became popular. Some well known works are ''Chandombudhi'', a prosody, and ''Karnataka Kadambari'', a romance, both written  by [[Nagavarma I]], a lexicon called ''Rannakanda'' by [[Ranna]] (993), a book on medicine called ''Karnataka-Kalyanakaraka'' by Jagaddala Somanatha, the earliest writing on astrology called ''Jatakatilaka'' by Sridharacharya (1049), a writing on erotics called ''Madanakatilaka'' by Chandraraja, and an encyclopedia called ''Lokapakara'' by Chavundaraya II (1025).<ref name="early"> Narasimhacharya (1988), pp61<U+2013>65</ref><ref name="jat">E.P.Rice (1921), p33</ref>
