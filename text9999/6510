'''Letterboxing''' is the practice of transferring [[widescreen]] [[film]]s to [[video]] formats while preserving the original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].  Since the video display is most often a more square aspect ratio than the original film, the resulting video must include masked-off areas above and below the picture area (often referred to as "black bars," or, more accurately, as [[Matte (filmmaking)|mattes]]).  Letterboxing takes its name from the similarity of the resulting image to a horizontal opening in a postal letter box. LTBX is an acronym used for programming using this format.

Letterboxing offers an alternative to the [[pan and scan]] or full screen method of transferring a widescreen film to video.  In pan and scan, the original image is cropped to suit the 1.33:1 (or 4:3) ratio of the television screen. In contrast, letterboxing preserves the original composition of the film as seen in the theater. 

Some filmmakers state a preference for letterboxed videos of their work.  [[Woody Allen]], for instance, insisted on a letterboxed release of ''[[Manhattan (1979 movie)|Manhattan]]''.  Director [[Sydney Pollack]] expressed a preference to preserving the widescreen in a bonus segment of the DVD of his film ''[[The Interpreter]]''  despite that film existing in pan & scan as well as letterbox versions.  One exception to this preference is [[Milo<U+0161> Forman]], who finds the matting distracting.  In any case, most video releases are made without consulting either the director or the cinematographer of the film. Videocassettes of films were often only released in pan-and-scan versions, but DVD releases tend to offer the option of pan-and-scan or letterboxed versions.

[[High-definition television]] (HDTV), a newer [[digital video]] system, uses video displays with a wider aspect ratio than standard [[television]] and is slowly becoming the broadcast standard in the [[United States]]. The wider screen will make it easier to make an accurate transfer of widescreen films.  In addition to theatrical films, some contemporary television programming is being produced in widescreen and high definition; and, when viewed on a conventional television, it appears in letterboxed format. Programs broadcasted in HDTV are sometimes letterboxed in standard-definition television (SDTV) sets.

In [[Europe]], letterboxing has long been the standard for showing widescreen theatrical movies on TV, partially because the [[PAL]] TV system with its higher resolution does not degrade letterboxed images as much as the American [[NTSC]] system. Together with the advance of digital broadcasting, which allows widescreen, 1.78:1 (or 16:9) transmissions without loss of resolution, 1.78:1 widescreen television is now slowly becoming common on European television for made-for-TV materials. Although this is not true high-definition TV, it does use the same aspect ratio.  The majority of programming in countries like [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] is now made in letterbox format; in [[Germany]] most made-for-TV programming is still broadcast in 1.33:1 and full screen.

Of course, on a true widescreen television set a 1.78:1 picture is no longer letterboxed since it fills the entire screen. However, movies made in even wider aspect ratios, such as 2.39:1, are letterboxed to some extent even on 1.78:1 television sets, but with thinner black bars.  Since the widescreen film aspect ratio 1.85:1 does not perfectly match the 1.78:1 (or 16:9) aspect ratio of Widescreen DVD's and High Definition Video, extremely minor letterboxing often exists for 1:85:1 film to DVD and HD transfers.  The resulting black bars are so thin that they are generally not visible on televisions and can be more easily viewed on computers, where every pixel of the image is displayed.  Much of the time the extreme edges of 1:85:1 film is cropped in the transfer process to match the 1.78:1 ratio of DVD's and HD.

Sometimes, by accident or design, a standard-ratio image is presented in the central portion of a letterboxed picture, resulting in a black border all around. This is referred to as "matchboxing" or "gutterboxing" and is generally disliked because it wastes a lot of screen space and reduces the resolution of the original image. This can, for instance, be seen on some of the DVD editions of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' movies whenever the widescreen documentaries included as extras use footage from the original TV series. The alternative would be to crop the original 1.33:1 TV images horizontally to fit the 1.78:1 ratio. This is referred to as "tilt and scan." This was a characteristic of video from the [[Fisher-Price]] [[PXL-2000]] camcorder of the late 1980s. 

[[Pillar box (film)|Pillar box]]ing, or [[window box (film)|windowboxing]], refers to what happens when a 1.33:1 image is displayed in a widescreen frame, or generally when an image is displayed in a wider frame, adding bars on the side.  For instance, a 1.85:1 image displayed within a 2.35:1 frame would require pillar boxing despite both aspect ratios being wider than 1.33:1.  [[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]] is an example of a mainstream American feature film that displays widescreen pillar boxing with numerous scenes of 1.85:1 within a 2.35:1 frame.  "Pillar box" comes from the similarity of this display to free-standing mailboxes in the UK and the British Commonwealth.
