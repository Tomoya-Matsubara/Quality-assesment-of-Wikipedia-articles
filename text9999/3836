'''Southport''' is a [[seaside resort|seaside town]] on the [[Irish Sea]] coast situated within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]], in [[England]]. The town is located {{convert|16.5|mi|km|1|lk=on}} to the north of [[Liverpool]] and {{convert|14.8|mi|km|1}} west-southwest of [[Preston]]. Southport has a population of around 100,000,<ref>[http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/ward/1312817476/report.aspx UK ward statistics on Nomis] UK National Statistics - taking the 7 wards in the Southport area: Dukes, Meols, Ainsdale, Birkdale, Kew, Norwood, Cambridge</ref> with approximately 40% of the population over 55 years old and around 55% defined as [[NRS social grade|social class ABC1]].

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], [[tourist]] attractions include [[Southport Pier]], the second longest seaside pleasure [[pier]] in [[Great Britain]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piers.co.uk/facts.htm|title=Longest Piers in the British Isles|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=National Piers Society}}</ref> [[Lord Street]], a tree-lined shopping street once home of [[Napoleon III of France]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lord-street.com/html/history.htm|title=Lord Street's History|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=Champion Media Group}}</ref> and a [[Pleasureland Southport|fairground]] which was originally opened in 1912.<ref name="">{{cite book| title=Pleasureland Memories: A History of Southport's Amusement Park| last=Copnall| first=Stephen| date=| year=2005| month=August| publisher=Skelter Publishing LLP| isbn=0-9544573-3-1}}</ref>

The town contains examples of [[Victorian architecture]] and  [[town planning]]. These include much of [[Lord Street]] in addition to Cambridge Hall, Town Hall and Wayfarers' Arcade. A particular feature of the town is the extensive tree planting. This was one of the conditions required by the Hesketh family when they made land available for development in the 19th century. Hesketh Park at the northern end of the town is named after the Hesketh family.

Extensive sand dunes stretch for several kilometers between [[Birkdale]] and [[Ainsdale]]/[[Woodvale, Merseyside|Woodvale]] to the south of the town. The [[Ainsdale]] sand dunes have been designated as a [[National Nature Reserves in England|National Nature Reserve in England]] and a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site. Local fauna include the [[Natterjack toad]] and the [[Sand lizard]].<ref>{{cite web | authorlink= JNCC.gov.uk | title= ramsar - JNCC | url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-161|}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | authorlink=Natural England | title= Natural England - Special Sites | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/nnr/nnr_details.asp?nnr_name=&C=0&Habitat=0&natural_area=&local_team=0&spotlight_reserve=1&X=&NNR_ID=1|

==History==
[[Image:William Sutton plaque.JPG|thumb|left|Plaque dedicated to [[William Sutton (Southport)|William Sutton]], located on the corner of Duke Street, Southport.]]
Southport, in its present form, was founded by [[William Sutton (Southport)|William Sutton]] ("The Mad Duke") in 1792.  However, there have been settlements in the area for much longer than that: the northern part of the town around St Cuthbert's Church (in the part of the parish of [[North Meols]] now known as [[Churchtown, Sefton|Churchtown]]), was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], and some areas of the town have names of [[Viking]] origin.<ref>[http://www.merseyreporter.com/history Mersey Reporter - Home Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Southport grew quickly in the 19th century as it gained a reputation for being a more refined seaside resort than its neighbour-up-the-coast [[Blackpool]]. The permanent funfair, [[Pleasureland Southport|Pleasureland]] closed in late 2006. 

Southport's suburbs are built around, and still named after, the old villages of the area.  From north to south, the districts are: [[Crossens]], [[Marshside, Sefton|Marshside]], [[Churchtown, Sefton|Churchtown]], [[Blowick]], [[Birkdale]], Hillside, [[Ainsdale]], and [[Woodvale, Merseyside|Woodvale]]; home to [[RAF Woodvale]].<ref>[http://www.merseyreporter.com/history/historic/woodvale/index.shtml RAF Woodvale (UK) Merseyside History Section<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The town of [[Formby]] is south of Southport, with  [[Hightown, Sefton|Hightown]] and [[Liverpool]] further southward, along the [[A565 road]].

[[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napol<U+00E9>on Bonaparte]] lived in exile on Lord Street, the main thoroughfare of Southport, between 1846 and 1848, before returning to France, where he became [[President of France|President]] and subsequently [[List of French monarchs|Emperor of the French]]. During his reign, he caused much of the medieval centre of Paris to be replaced with broad tree-lined boulevards, covered walkways and arcades, just like Lord Street. On the strength of this coincidence, it has been suggested that the redevelopment may have been inspired by memories of Southport's town centre.<ref name=Nevin>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,,1287609,00.html | title=Ooh La Lancashire| last=Nevin | first=Charles | date=2004-08-21| publisher=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref>

[[Image:Southport lifeboat disaster memorial 1.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial to the crew of the "Eliza Fernley" lifeboat, in Duke Street Cemetery, Southport.]]
On the night of the [[December 9]], [[1886]], the worst [[Southport and St Anne's lifeboats disaster|lifeboat disaster]] in the history of the UK occurred off the shores of Southport. A cargo ship called the ''Mexico'' was on its way to [[South America]] when it found itself in difficulty. Lifeboats from [[Lytham]], [[St. Annes]] and Southport set off in order to try and rescue those aboard the vessel. The crews battled against storm-force winds as they rowed towards the casualty. The entire crew from the St. Anne<U+2019>s boat was lost and all but two of the Southport crew were too. In all, 28 lifeboatmen lost their lives on that night, leaving many widows and fatherless children. A memorial was erected in Duke Street Cemetery and a permanent exhibition can be seen in the Museum of the Botanic Gardens in Churchtown, Southport.

In 1925, the [[RNLI]] abandoned the station at Southport and left the town with no lifeboat. However in the late 1980s, after a series of unfortunate tragedies, local families from Southport started to raise funds and eventually bought a  new lifeboat for the town stationed at the old RNLI lifeboat house.<ref>[http://www.southport-lifeboat.co.uk S.O.R.T. Website]</ref> The lifeboat is completely independent from the RNLI and receives no money from them. Instead it relies entirely on donations from the public.

==Geography and Climate==
At {{coor dms|53|38|43.44|N|3|0|29.88|W|city}} the town is situated in [[North West England]]. The closest cities are [[Preston]] approximately {{convert|20|km|0}} to the north east and [[Liverpool]] approximately {{convert|20|km|0}} to the south.

Existing on the [[West Lancashire Coastal Plain]] most of the town is only slightly above sea-level and thus parts of Southport used to be susceptible to [[flooding]]. This would be most frequently noticed on Southport's Marine Drive, which was regularly closed due to flooding from [[high tide]]s. But in February 1997, new [[sea defences]] started being constructed and in 2002 the whole project was completed.<ref>[http://www.seftoncoast.org.uk/ Sefton Coast]</ref>

Southport has a [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]] like most of the UK. Due to its position by the coast, Southport rarely sees substantial [[snowfall]] and temperatures rarely fall below <U+2013>5<U+00B0>C so it doesn't have frequent [[frost]]s. Southport generally has moderate precipitation, unlike the rest of western UK.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/mapped.html Met Office - Mapped Averages]</ref>

==Governance and politics==
Politically, Southport is a stronghold of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] also strong in some areas. [[John Pugh]] is [[Southport (UK Parliament constituency)|Southport]]'s current [[Member of Parliament]].<ref>http://www.johnpugh.org.uk/index.htm</ref>

Southport lies within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]], and was incorporated as [[municipal borough]] in 1866. It became a [[county borough]] independent of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire in 1915, having reached the minimum 50,000 population (the 1911 census gave a figure of 51,643). The [[Birkdale]] Urban District, including the parishes of Birkdale and Ainsdale was added to Southport in 1912.

Under the 1971 Local Government White Paper, presented in February 1971, Southport would have lost its county borough status, becoming a [[non-metropolitan district]] within Lancashire.  Rather than accept this fate and lose its separate education and social services departments, Southport Corporation lobbied for inclusion in the nearby planned [[metropolitan county]] of [[Merseyside]], to join with [[Bootle]] and other units to form a district with the 250,000 required population. It was duly included in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton]]<ref>{{cite hansard|house=House of Commons|date=6 July, 1972|column=878}}</ref>

This decision has been regretted by some of the population. A recurring local political issue has been the cross-party movement campaigning for Southport to leave Sefton and form its own [[unitary authority]], perhaps adjoined to the neighbouring [[West Lancashire]] authority.  Support for this has been seen amongst [[Liberal Democrat (UK)]] councillors,<ref>http://www.southportlibdems.com/meols.htm</ref> and also within the Southport [[Conservative Party (UK)]].<ref>[http://www.southportconservatives.com/section/2/ Southport Conservative Party Website], [http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=people.person.page&personID=126601 Conservative Party Website]</ref>

In 1980, a [[Private Member's Bill]] proposed restoring Southport to Lancashire, and renaming the residue of Sefton to the Metropolitan Borough of Bootle.  The [[Local Government Boundary Commission for England]] conducted a review of the area in 1987, which attracted 10,000 messages, of which "70% were [[pro forma]]". In 1990 the LGBC made suggestions that Southport, Ainsdale and Birkdale should be made a district of Lancashire: the final recommendations in 1991 "concluded that public opinion was more evenly divided than initially thought", and also that eastward transport links with Lancashire were poor compared to those southward to the Liverpool area.

The government again directed the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]] to make a review in December 1996 (after it had finished the work on the [[1990s UK local government reform|creation of unitary authorities]]), commencing in January 1997. This review was constrained by the legal inability of the commission to recommend that the current Sefton-West Lancashire border be altered. In an MORI poll conducted at the behest of the LGCE, 65% of Southport residents supported the campaign, compared to 37% in the borough as a whole. Local MPs [[Matthew Banks]] and [[Ronnie Fearn]] (MPs for Southport at various times) supported making Southport a unitary authority, with Banks wishing to see it tied to Lancashire [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonially]], but Fearn wishing to see it remain, as a separate borough, in Merseyside.

The commission noted that Southport would have a relatively low population for a unitary authority, even including Formby (89,300 or 114,700), and that it was worried about the viability of a south Sefton authority without Southport, and therefore recommended the status quo be kept.  However, the commission suggested the use of [[area committee]]s for the various parts of the borough and also that Southport could become a [[civil parish]].<ref>Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Sefton, Local Government Commission for England, November 1997</ref> Another request made in 2004 was turned down, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)]] must request such a review).
  
In 2002, a local independent party calling themselves the Southport Party was established, with many members supporting a policy of "Southport out of Sefton". Three council seats were won in the 2002 local elections, including that of the leader of Sefton Council, Liberal Democrat Councillor, David Bamber. At the following election there were no gains and a drop in the number of votes for the party. At the all out election in 2004, 1 of their councillors stood down, whilst the other 2 lost their seats. They have not regained any seats, although the group retains a campagning presence in the town.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}  

To date, there have been no further moves to change Sefton's boundaries, but the Boundary Commission indicated in 2004 that a future review is possible:

:''"whether or not structural change takes place in accordance with our recommendations, the boundaries between or within Sefton and West Lancashire could be reviewed at a later stage to address these long-standing boundary concerns."''<ref>[http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/files/dms/CumbriaLancsWEB_13442-10320__E__.pdf Boundary Committee Website]</ref>

==Education==

{{Unreferencedsection|date=April 2008}}

The town possesses a variety of academic institutions, both private and state-funded. The prestigious all-girls' [[Greenbank High School]] situated next to the [[Royal Birkdale Golf Club]], repeatedly gains grades of the highest standard. It offers pupils a wide-range of subjects, particularly languages, and has educated some of the country's most esteemed talent, including the actress, [[Miranda Richardson]]. The male equivalent (also situated in [[Birkdale]]) is the all-boys' Birkdale High School, also known for its academic success. There are several other high schools prominent in the town, including [[Stanley High School]], (which is a specialist Sports College), Meols Cop High School, and [[Christ the King Catholic High School|Christ the King School]]. 

[[King George V College]], is one of the most respected [[sixth form college]]s in the area, which sees pupils travel far and wide (from [[Maghull]], [[Bootle]] etc) to sample its academic success. Its academic achievements repeatedly rival some of the private institutions in the surrounding area, including [[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby|Merchant Taylors]] and [[St Mary's College, Crosby|St Mary's College]] in [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]]. It has gained particular prestige for its Classics and History departments, both having been credited with being placed in the top five in the country, and the Classics department was voted top in the country in recent years.

==Economy==
Southport also hosts varied events including an annual air show,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.southportairshow.com/ | publisher=Sefton Council | title=Southport Air Show Official | accessdate=2006-08-01}}</ref> [[Southport Flower Show|flower show]], an open air classical music concert concluded with a fireworks display, a jazz festival, a beer festival with over seventy beers,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.southportcamra.org.uk/beerfest.htm |author=Southport CAMRA | title=Beer Festival}}</ref> and the turning on of the pleasant town centre Christmas lights. On [[July 12]] every year, there is an [[Orange Institution|Orangemen's]] march, which is one of the busiest days of the year. Southport hosts the annual musical fireworks championships, and [[The Open Championship]] at the [[Royal Birkdale Golf Club]] course. It is also home to the "Southport Weekender",<ref>[http://www.southportweekender.co.uk/ Southport Weekender Website]</ref> an annual dance event that takes place at the [[Pontins]] resort in the town. Southport is also home to one of the largest independent dairies in Britain, [[Bates Dairy|Bates]].

==Media==
The town's media consists of two rival newspaper groups, and two radio stations. The independently owned 'Champion' newspaper is a free weekly paper and [[Trinity Mirror]]'s 'Sefton & West Lancs Media Mix' titles ''The Mid-week Visiter''<!-- NB: CORRECT spelling --> and ''The Southport Visiter''<!-- NB: CORRECT spelling --> (Fridays) are free and paid-for respectively. The town also falls within the circulation areas of three regional hard copy newspapers; ''The [[Liverpool Echo]]'', ''The [[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' and ''The [[Lancashire Evening Post]]''. Southport is also covered by several local and regional magazines, like [[Lancashire Life]].  The local [[Park ranger|Ranger]] Service, which is part of Sefton MBC, runs a quarterly free magazine called ''Coastlines''.

Old Southport Newspapers that are no longer in print are as follows: ''Independent'' 1861-1920's;<ref name=localnews>{{cite book | title=Local Newspapers | author=Federation of Family History Societies | isbn=0-907099-46-7}}</ref> ''Liverpool & Southport News'' 1861-1872;<ref name=localnews/> ''Southport News'' (West Lancs) 1881-1885;<ref name=localnews/> ''Southport Standard'' 1885-1899;<ref name=localnews/> Southport Guardian ''1882-1930'';<ref name=localnewsfrom>{{cite book | title=Local Newspapers | author=Federation of Family History Societies | isbn=0-907099-46-7}} - "Published from" date only</ref> ''Southport Journal'' 1904-1932;<ref name=localnewsfrom/> ''Southport Star''; ''Southport Advertiser''.

The town's commercial radio station [[Dune FM|107.9 Dune FM]] was recently sold by [[The Local Radio Company]] to independent operators NIOCOM. On a regional level Southport is covered by several local and regional radio stations, including:[[BBC Radio Merseyside]], [[BBC Radio Lancashire]], [[Radio City 96.7]], [[City Talk 105.9]], and [[97.4 Rock FM|Rock FM 97.4]].

Southport is situated within the television regions of [[BBC]] North West and [[ITV|ITV's]] [[Granada Television]], but some areas of Southport can also pick up the Welsh TV stations. This might change as the analogue system is phased out in 2009.

The area also has many online media sites, including an [[online newspaper]], the [[Southport Reporter]], as well as chat forums and [[blog]] sites.

==Landmarks==
[[Image:Pleasureland, Southport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pleasureland Southport|Pleasureland]] in 2005.]]
One of Southport's main attractions for many years was [[Pleasureland (fairground)|Pleasureland]], a fairground established in 1912. It was owned by the [[Thompson Family]], and was closed in September 2006. A replacement fairground on the same site, provisionally named [[New Pleasureland]],<ref>http://www.newpleasureland.co.uk [[New Pleasureland]] Website</ref> opened in July 2007.<ref>http://www.southportreporter.com/302/ Local Newspaper Website Report</ref> An earlier permanent funfair, [[Peter Pan's Playground]], closed in the 1980s and is now the site of part of the Ocean Plaza shopping development. A former landmark of Pleasureland was the Looping Star roller coaster, which was on site from 1985-87. It featured in the video for the pop single Wonderful Life, by Liverpool band [[Black (English band)|Black]], which was also shot at other parts of the Sefton and North West coastline.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyfu_mU-dmo YouTube - Wonderful Life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

The Model Railway Village is situated in Kings Gardens opposite the Royal Clifton Hotel and near the Marine Lake Bridge. The Model Railway Village opened in May 1996 and was created by Ray and Jean Jones. The Jones family still run the attraction today. The Model Railway Village season extends from April to the end of October. However due to popular demand the season has extended into weekend openings during November, February and March, weather permitting.<ref>[http://www.southportmodelrailwayvillage.co.uk Model Village Website]</ref> An earlier model village, the Land of the Little People, was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the aborted Winter Gardens/SIBEC shopping development. Its site is now occupied by a Morrison's supermarket.
 
Other major attractions in Southport include Splash World, an indoor [[water park]] situated on the back of the Dunes [[swimming pool]] which opened in June 2007.<ref>[http://www.splashworldsouthport.com Splash World URL]</ref>

[[Meols Hall]], a manor house, home of the Hesketh family is open to the public from the [[August 14]]-[[September 14]] from 2pm-5pm. Set in its own expansive grounds, it boasts a history back to the [[Domesday Book]] and is full of interesting pictures and furniture.

The Power Station, home of the town's own Radio station 107.9 Dune fm on the edge of Victoria Park, which itself is home to the [[Southport Flower Show]]

==Transport==
===Road===
Due to its position by the coast, Southport is a [[linear settlement]] and as such can only be approached in a limited number of directions by road. 

The main roads entering Southport are:
* the [[A565 road|A565]] (from [[Preston]] to the north east), 
* the [[A570 road|A570]] (from [[Ormskirk]] and [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] to the south east),
* the A565 (from [[Bootle]] and [[Formby]] to the south).  

There is no direct connection to the motorway from Southport; the nearest connections are: 
*''from the south'' - junction 3 of the [[M58 motorway|M58]] (on the A570, twelve miles)
*''from the north'' - junction 1 of the [[M65 motorway|M65]] (on the [[A582 road|A582]]/[[A59 road|A59]], nineteen miles)

[[Image:Marine Way Bridge.JPG|thumb|left|Marine Way Bridge.]]
An east-west bypass for the A570 at [[Ormskirk]] is planned to relieve congestion on Southport's main access route to the motorway network, although the effectiveness of the proposals are still under debate.<ref>[http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/news/press_releases/2004/11/17/0002.asp Local Gov. Website.]</ref>

Several areas within Southport town centre have recently undergone major road redevelopment; the largest scheme was the construction of the Marine Way Bridge (opened May 2004), which connects the Lord Street shopping district with the new seafront developments. The 150 foot high structure is thought to have cost in the region of <U+00A3>5m.<ref>[http://www.championline.net/html/news/champnews_display.asp?story=5781 Local newspaper report]</ref>

Also one of the main shopping areas in the town, Chapel Street, has undergone a pedestrianisation scheme to be similar to parts of Liverpool city centre.

===Aviation===
Southport is also home to Birkdale Sands, a sand runway located on one of Southport's beaches. For many years this was used for pleasure flights using one of the last [[De Havilland]] [[De Havilland Fox Moth|Fox Moth]] [[aeroplane]]s flying in the UK.

===Rail===
[[Image:Southport railway station.JPG|thumb|right|[[Southport railway station]].]]
Southport has a [[Southport railway station|railway station]] with a frequent service of electric trains to [[Liverpool]] and a regular service to [[Wigan]], [[Bolton, Greater Manchester|Bolton]], [[Manchester]], [[Manchester Airport]] and [[Rochdale]].

The Liverpool line was originally built by the [[Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway]] in 1848. It was followed on [[9 April]] [[1855]] by the [[Manchester and Southport Railway]] with a line to Manchester via [[Wigan]].

Formerly, Southport was also served by two further railway lines:

* From 1882, the [[West Lancashire Railway]] operated from [[Southport Derby Road railway station|Southport Derby Road]] station to [[Preston Fishergate Hill]]. This line was shut in 1964, however. Nowadays, the towns of Southport and Preston are linked only by the (largely dual-carriageway) A565 and A59 roads.

* In 1884, another line from Southport to Liverpool was opened: the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s [[Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway]] extended the CLC's [[North Liverpool Extension Line]] from [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] to [[Southport Lord Street railway station|Southport Lord Street]]. The West Lancashire Railway sponsored the [[Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway]] to provide a connection to the CLC line, joining it at Altcar and Hillhouse.<ref>[http://www.southportpast.com/altcarbob.shtml Southport Past Website]</ref> These lines ultimately proved uncompetitive, however, and the Southport services were withdrawn in 1952.

In July 1897, both the West Lancashire and the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railways were absorbed into the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (L&Y). The L&Y had a large terminus at Southport Chapel Street and could see no sense in operating two termini at very close proximity. In 1901, the L&Y completed a remodeling of the approach lines to Central to allow trains to divert onto the Manchester to Southport line and into Southport Chapel Street Station. Southport Central was closed to passengers and it became a goods depot eventually amalgamating with Chapel Street depot. It survived intact well into the 1970s.

==Sports==
[[Image:haig Avenue.JPG|thumb|left|[[Haig Avenue]], home of [[Southport F.C.]]]]
Southport is somewhat lesser known for its sporting prowess, but being surrounded by other North West cities this is understandable. The eastern side of town towards Blowick and Kew is home to the "Sandgrounders" - [[Southport F.C.]], a club with a long football league history and occasional [[FA Cup]] giantkillers, they play at [[Haig Avenue]] and currently find themselves in the [[Conference North]] League. There is also a league for local amateur football teams. 
Southport is also home to a rugby union club, Southport RUFC,<ref>[http://www.southportrufc.com/ Southport Rugby Football Club Website]</ref> who play at the Recreational Ground on Waterloo Road, Hillside.

Southport is also home to one of the largest junior football clubs in the north west, boasting both a boys' and girls' sections, as well as male and female. The youngest boys' team are Under 7s, with the girls being Under 9s. The club has been the foundations for many professional footballers, including Dominic Matteo, Shaun Teale and Paul Dalgleish.

The junior section of Southport RUFC are known as the Southport Sharks,<ref>[http://www.southportsharks.com/ Southport Sharks Website]</ref> and have sides that range from 7 years old upwards. They also play on the same grounds, and train every Sunday 10am-12noon. 

However, the town is probably best known for [[golf]]; the [[Royal Birkdale Golf Club]] situated in the dunes to the south of the town is one of the venues on [[The Open Championship]] rotation and has hosted two [[Ryder Cup]]s. Nearby [[Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club]] is also a two time Ryder Cup venue and [[Hillside Golf Club]] hosts many major events as well as being a final open qualifying course. Many smaller links courses also surround the town.
Southport also holds its own small skatepark, located next to the Marine Way Bridge. It is open to skateboarders and BMX riders.

[[Image:PC310021.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sculling|Sculler]] on Marine Lake.]]
Southport's location by the coast also lends itself to some more specialised sporting activities - Ainsdale Beach, south of the town, is popular for kite sports, including kite-surfing. In 1925, [[Henry Segrave]] set a world [[land speed record]] of 152.33&nbsp;mph on the beach, driving the [[Sunbeam Tiger (1925)|Sunbeam Tiger]]. His association is largely forgotten locally, but is commemorated by the name of a pub on Lord St.

Marine Lake lies nestled between the town centre and the sea and is used for a variety of water-sports including water-skiing, sailing and rowing. The lake is home to the [[West Lancs Yacht Club|West Lancashire Yacht Club]] and Southport Sailing Club, both of which organise [[dinghy]] racing.  The annual [[Southport 24 Hour Race]], organised by the West Lancashire Yacht Club, is an endurance race of national standing, with an average turnout of 60 to 80 boats. In 2006, the event marked its 40th anniversary.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolreporter.com/tv/24hour05/ 24-hour yacht race (video)]</ref>

The flat and scenic route alongside the beach is very popular with cyclists, and is the start of the [[Trans Pennine Trail]], a [[National Cycle Network|cycle route]] running across the north of the country to [[Selby]] in [[North Yorkshire]], through [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and on to [[Hornsea]] on the east coast.

==Scouting==
