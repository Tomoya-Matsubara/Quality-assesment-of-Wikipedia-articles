"It was just an experiment gone right from the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals", said Timberlake. "It's one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its just one of those 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody.

"I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did.

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "SexyBack" was directed by [[Michael Haussman]] and features Spanish actress [[Elena Anaya]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/premium/publica/publica?COMPID=51277555513&ID_PAGINA=22088&ID_FORMATO=9&turbourl=false|title=La actriz Elena Anaya protagoniza el nuevo videoclip de Justin Timberlake|date=2006-07-24|work=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-09-15}}</ref> The video was filmed in June 2006<ref>{{cite news|title=Timberlake and Diaz Recover From 'Rough Patch'|date=2006-06-28|publisher=[[World Entertainment News Network]]}}</ref> and shot in a luxury building in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Victoria|last=Newton|title=Lustin' bustin' Justin is back&nbsp;<U+2014> Bizarre|date=2006-07-26|work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|page=21}}</ref> In discussion of the video filmed in Barcelona, Timberlake said: "Obviously we went for the architecture, the exteriors, the interiors <U+2014> the vibe in Spain is different than anywhere else in the world. It's so cool to shoot there, but the girls are also pretty hot, so that doesn't hurt either."<ref name="vineyard"/>

Timberlake decided to work with director Michael Haussman, following his work on [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1994 music video for "[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]". "It's one of my favorite videos Madonna's ever done," Timberlake said. "Even today, I still remember the visuals, the images, how he captured her. A lot of times, Madonna seems like she's the person in control, and in that video, she seemed vulnerable. It was a cool thing to see."<ref name="vineyard"/> The video was first shown on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Making the Video]]'' on July 25, 2006.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Life: Short List|date=2006-07-25|work=[[The Press of Atlantic City]]|page=B1}}</ref>

The video starts off with a cable car looking over a large city (Barcelona, from the West looking East) and switches to a luxurious-looking hotel in Pla<U+00E7>a de Catalunya with Elena Anaya taking off her sweater. It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake in front of a white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps her and they have sex. In the club, it ends with Timberlake cornering Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves by the same way he entered and moments later jumps back to the balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a chair beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.
