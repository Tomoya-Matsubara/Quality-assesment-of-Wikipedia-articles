"'''Pictures of You'''" is a song by [[The Cure]] written by [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] from the [[1989 in music|1989]] album ''[[Disintegration]]''.

== History ==
The single version is much shorter than the album version, which is 7:24 minutes long rather than 4:48 minutes. There are also 2 different extended versions on the 2 UK 12" singles, one of which is the 'Strange Mix' that later appeared on ''[[Mixed Up]]''. The other is similar to the album version.

According to interviews, the inspiration of the song came when a fire broke loose in Robert Smith's home. After that day, Robert was going though the remains and came across his wallet which had pictures of his wife, Mary. The cover of the single is one of the pictures. The same picture is featured on the "[[Charlotte Sometimes (song)|Charlotte Sometimes]]" cover, but this one is the full image while the 1981 single's cover was distorted.

In 2004 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it #278 on the [[list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

Pictures of You was used as theme of a [[HP]] commercial called 'You' in 2003.
