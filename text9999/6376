The '''Yukon Quest 1,000-mile International Sled Dog Race''', or '''Yukon Quest''', is a [[sled dog]] race run every February between [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], and [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], [[Yukon]]. Because of the harsh winter conditions, difficult trail, and limited support competitors are allowed, it is considered the "most difficult sled dog race in the world",<ref name="zirkle"/> or even the "toughest race in the world".<ref name="balzar 15"/> 

In the competition, first run in 1984, a dog team leader (called a [[mushing|musher]]) and a team of 6 to 14&nbsp;dogs race for 10 to 20&nbsp;days. The course follows the route of the historic 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], mail delivery, and transportation routes between Fairbanks, [[Dawson City]], and Whitehorse. Mushers pack up to {{convert|250|lb|kg|0}} of equipment and provisions for themselves and their dogs to survive between checkpoints. They are permitted to leave dogs at checkpoints and dog drops, but not to replace them. [[dog sled|Sled]]s may not be replaced (without penalty) and mushers cannot accept help from non-racers except at Dawson City, the halfway mark. Ten checkpoints and four dog drops, some more than {{convert|200|mi|km|0}} apart, lie along the trail. [[Veterinarian]]s are present at each to ensure the health and welfare of the dogs, give advice, and provide veterinary care for dropped dogs; together with the race marshal or a race judge, they may remove a dog or team from the race for medical or other reasons.

The route runs on frozen rivers, over four mountain ranges, and through isolated northern villages. Racers cover {{convert|1016|mi|km|0}} or more, temperatures commonly drop as low as {{convert|<U+2212>60|F|C|0}}, and winds can reach {{convert|50|mph|0}} at higher elevations. [[Sonny Lindner]] won the inaugural race in 1984 from a field of 26&nbsp;teams. The fastest run took place in 2009, when [[Sebastian Schnuelle]] finished after 9&nbsp;days, 23&nbsp;hours, and 20&nbsp;minutes. The 2009 competition also had the closest one-two finish, as Schnuelle beat second-place Hugh Neff by just four minutes. [[Lance Mackey]], who held the quickest finish record before Schnuelle, is the only musher to have won the race four times. In 2007, he became the first to win both the Yukon Quest and the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when [[Ty Halvorson]] took 20&nbsp;days, 8&nbsp;hours, and 29&nbsp;minutes to finish. In 2000, [[Aliy Zirkle]] became the first woman to win the race, in 10&nbsp;days, 22&nbsp;hours, and 57&nbsp;minutes. To allow participation in both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod, the 2010 Yukon Quest will begin in Fairbanks one week earlier than usual<U+2014>on February 6. Yukon Quest International, which runs the Yukon Quest sled dog race, also runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the Yukon Quest 300 (previously the Yukon Quest 250).

== History ==
The idea for the Yukon Quest originated in April 1983 during a bar-room discussion among four Alaskans: LeRoy Shank, Roger Williams, Ron Rosser, and Willie Libb.<ref>Yukon Quest International. [http://www.yukonquest.com/site/race-history-and-background/ "Yukon Quest race history"], Yukonquest.com. Accessed February 22, 2009.</ref> The four proposed a thousand-mile sled dog race from Fairbanks, Alaska to Whitehorse, Yukon, to celebrate the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]-era mail and transportation routes between the two.<ref name="founding">Saari, Matias.

Accessed February 22, 2009.</ref> They disdained the many checkpoints and [[Race stage|stages]] of the [[Iditarod Sled Dog Race]]<ref>Firth, p. 248</ref> and envisioned an endurance race in which racers would rely on themselves and survival would be as important as speed.<ref name="Firth28"/> "We wanted more of a [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] experience, a race that would put a little woodsmanship into it", Shank said at the race's 25th anniversary.<ref name="founding"/>

This remained a vague plan until August 1983, when the first public organizational meetings took place.<ref name="founding"/> Fundraising began, and the start date for the race was optimistically moved forward from February 1985 to February 25, 1984. The entry fee for the first race was $500, and Murray Clayton of [[Haines, Alaska]] became the first person to enter when he paid his fee in October 1983.<ref name="founding"/> In December 1983, the race was officially named the Yukon Quest.<ref>Staff report. [http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/dec/22/looking-back-fairbanks-dec-22/ "Looking back in Fairbanks <U+2014> Dec. 22"], ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''. December 22, 2008. Accessed May 14, 2009.</ref> Two more months of planning followed, and a crew of volunteers was organized to staff the checkpoints and place trail markers.<ref name="founding"/> On February 25, 1984, 26&nbsp;racers left Fairbanks for Whitehorse.<ref name="1984race"/> Each team was limited to a maximum of 12 dogs, and racers had to finish with no fewer than nine. They also had to haul {{convert|25|lb|kg|0}} of food per dog ({{convert|300|lb|kg|0}} total) to cover the long distances between checkpoints.<ref name="founding"/>

Numerous problems occurred in the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the [[snowmobile]] intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in [[Dawson City]] until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked {{convert|60|mi|km}} to avoid a section of snowless trail, then had to deal with open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures.<ref name="1984race"/> The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race's 25th anniversary, he recalled, "I think it was 90&nbsp;percent (camping) trip and maybe a little bit of racing."<ref name="1984race">Saari, Matias.

=== First decade ===
After the inaugural race, organizers improved the marking of the trail for the first contest held in the Whitehorse<U+2013>Fairbanks direction. Musher Bill Cotter said, "The trail was so nice that it was difficult to keep from going too fast."<ref>Saari, Matias.

In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 completed the race<U+2014>the most that have ever finished it.<ref name="yq1989"/> In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs became the first (and so far only) mother and daughter to compete in the same Yukon Quest: Terri finished 21st, beating her mother (22nd) by 26&nbsp;minutes.<ref>Saari, Matias.

Accessed February 27, 2009.</ref> The 1991 race saw eight teams withdraw in the first quarter due to an outbreak of a canine disease called the "[[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] Virus". Thirty-five more dogs were sickened before the spread of the virus was halted by colder weather halfway through the race.<ref>Firth, p. 196</ref> In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused problems in the first half of the race, and the second was affected by bitter cold.<ref>Saari, Matias.

Because he did not quit, race officials gave him the Red Lantern Award.<ref>Firth, p. 201</ref>

Following the 1992 race, controversy erupted when the Alaska board of directors of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed it would be easier to manage an Alaska-only race.<ref>Firth, p. 234</ref> A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors.<ref name="Firth235">Firth, p. 235</ref> The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90&nbsp;minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for [[ibuprofen]].<ref>Saari, Matias.

In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove was denied entry by Canadian customs officials in the pre-race verification process, the first and only time a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border.<ref>Firth, p. 207</ref> Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of the Yukon Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board members who had proposed it.<ref name="Firth235"/>

=== Second decade ===
The 1995 race featured 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished.<ref>Saari, Matias. [http://newsminer.com/news/2008/feb/06/1995/ "1995"], ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''. February 6, 2008.

Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused to let this sponsorship money be used to pay debts accumulated in Alaska, members of the Alaska board threatened to host a separate competition. In the end, the Alaska board members were forced to resign, and a deal was worked out between the two sides.<ref>Firth, p. 236</ref>

The stretch between Pelly Crossing and Dawson City is the greatest distance between checkpoints of any sled dog competition in the world.<ref>Killick, p. 132</ref> Between the two sites are {{convert|201|mi|km|0}} of open trail, marked only by a dog drop at [[Scroggie Creek]], an abandoned gold-mining site activated only during the Yukon Quest.<ref name="Trail map"/> 

From Pelly Crossing, mushers travel west on the frozen [[Pelly River]], or on a road that parallels the river if ice conditions are poor. At [[Stepping Stone, Yukon|Stepping Stone]], shortly before the Pelly and Yukon rivers meet, they can rest at a hospitality stop before turning north. <ref>Killick, p. 133</ref> From Stepping Stone to Scroggie Creek the trail consists of a mining road or "cat" road, named for the [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] tracked mining vehicles that use it. Before organizers coordinated schedules with the mining equipment operators, racers often had to contend with heavy machinery blocking the trail or turning it into a muddy path.<ref>Firth, pp. 140&ndash;144</ref> The Scroggie Creek dog drop is at the confluence of the [[Stewart River]] and Scroggie Creek.<ref>Killick, pp. 140&ndash;141</ref>

After Scroggie Creek, the trail switches from a westerly direction to almost directly north. At this point, mushers enter the gold-mining district surrounding Dawson City. From the Stewart River adjacent to Scroggie, the trail climbs, crossing the Yukon Territory's Black Hills.<ref name="datrail3">Schandelmeier, p. 3</ref> Fifty miles (80&nbsp;km) from Dawson City and {{convert|55|mi|km|0}} from Scroggie Creek, it crosses the [[Indian River (Yukon)|Indian River]], and mushers begin the climb to King Solomon's Dome, the highest point ({{convert|4002|ft|m|0}}) on the trail.<ref name="datrail3"/> The trail ascends more gradually in the Whitehorse<U+2013>Fairbanks route than in the opposite direction, where mushers have to endure several [[Hairpin turn|switchbacks]].<ref>Killick, pp. 147&ndash;148</ref> When mushers start in Whitehorse, they already have gained several thousand feet from the ascent into the Black Hills, including a climb over 3,550-foot (1,082&nbsp;m) [[Eureka Dome]].<ref>O'Donoghue, p. 116</ref> The main difficulties come during the descent from King Solomon's Dome to [[Bonanza Creek]], the epicenter of the Klondike Gold Rush.<ref>Killick, p. 148</ref> After reaching the creek, mushers thread through an area of mining waste<ref>O'Donoghue, pp. 136&ndash;137</ref> and follow the [[Klondike River]] to Dawson City, the halfway point of the race. They are required to rest for 36&nbsp;hours in Dawson City.<ref>Killick, p. 153</ref>

=== Dawson City to Eagle ===
[[File:Fortymile River from Taylor Highway.jpg|250px|alt=A choppy river is seen surrounded by tree-covered hills.|thumb|left|The [[Fortymile River]] section of the race is among the coldest along the trail.]]
The distance from Dawson City to [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]], the first checkpoint in Alaska for the Whitehorse<U+2013>Fairbanks route, is {{convert|147|mi|km|0}}.<ref name="Trail map"/> The second half of the race is conducted in a time-even fashion: mushers leave in staggered order, their rest times adjusted to make up for the staggered start.<ref>Killick, p. 168</ref>

Racers exit Dawson City on the Yukon River and follow it for about {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} to the [[Fortymile River]] hospitality stop.<ref name="datrail3"/> The river's name comes from its distance from [[Fort Reliance]], an abandoned trading post established in 1874.<ref>Killick, p. 173</ref> From the hospitality stop, mushers travel southwest on the Fortymile River in what is one of the coldest portions of the race, due to cold air sinking to the bottom of the river valley.<ref>Killick, p. 186</ref> The trail on the river crosses the Alaska<U+2013>Canada border, noticeable only because of the [[border vista]], a strip of land cleared of all foliage.<ref>Killick, p. 192</ref> Shortly past the border, the river turns northwest, and mushers leave its frozen surface when it meets the [[Taylor Highway]],<ref name="datrail3"/> a road closed to automobile traffic during the winter. As the trail follows the highway for {{convert|49|mi|km|0}} conditions are often hazardous, with high winds and drifting snow that can obscure trail markers. After climbing the 3,420-foot (1,042&nbsp;m) American Summit,<ref name="Trail map"/> the trail gradually descends {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} to Eagle, on the banks of the Yukon River.<ref name="datrail3"/>

=== Eagle to Central ===

The route from Eagle to [[Central, Alaska|Central]] covers a distance of {{convert|233|mi|km|0}}.<ref name="Trail map"/> In winter, Eagle is buffeted by high winds and drifting snow funneled through the town by nearby Eagle Bluff, which stands {{convert|300|ft|m}} above the Yukon River.<ref>Killick, pp. 195&ndash;196</ref> Because it is the first stop in the United States, competitors are greeted at Eagle by a [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] official who checks passports and entry documents.<ref>Killick, p. 195</ref> 

After leaving Eagle, mushers travel northwest for {{convert|159|mi|km|0}} on the Yukon River,<ref name="Trail map"/> except for a few short [[portage]]s.<ref name="datrail3"/> During this stretch, two hospitality stops are available. The first is 28&nbsp;miles (45&nbsp;km) from Eagle at [[Trout Creek, Alaska|Trout Creek]].<ref>Killick, p. 217</ref> The next is [[Biederman's Cabin]], the former home of [[Charlie Biederman]], one of the last people to deliver mail by sled dog. (The final sled dog mail route was canceled in 1963, and Biederman's sled hangs in the [[National Postal Museum]].)<ref>Balzar, p. 170</ref><ref>Killick, p. 225</ref> A dog drop site is located 18&nbsp;miles (29&nbsp;km) from Biederman's Cabin at [[Slaven's Cabin]], a historic site operated by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>Killick, p. 229</ref> Some 60&nbsp;miles (97&nbsp;km) past Slaven's Cabin mushers arrive in [[Circle, Alaska|Circle]],<ref name="datrail4">Schandelmeier, p. 4</ref> so named because its founders believed it was on the [[Arctic Circle]]. (Circle is actually about {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} south of that line.)<ref>Killick, p. 233</ref>

From Circle, it is {{convert|74|mi|km|0}} to the checkpoint in [[Central, Alaska|Central]].<ref name="Trail map"/> Mushers follow [[Birch Creek (Alaska)|Birch Creek]] south until just before [[Central Hot Springs, Alaska|Central Hot Springs]]. This area, along with the Fortymile stretch, is considered among the coldest on the trail, and mushers are advised to prepare for {{convert|-60|F|C|0}} temperatures.<ref name="datrail4"/> Turning west, they travel through frozen swamps before reaching the Steese Roadhouse checkpoint in Central.<ref>Killick, p. 238</ref>

=== Central to Two Rivers ===
[[Image:Steese Roadhouse Alaska.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A wooden building is decorated with signs and the carved outline of a dog team|Steese Roadhouse, seen here in summer, is home to the [[Central, Alaska|Central]] checkpoint of the Yukon Quest.]]
From Central to the final (or first, in the Fairbanks<U+2013>Whitehorse direction) checkpoint in [[Two Rivers, Alaska|Two Rivers]] is {{convert|115|mi|km|0}}.<ref name="Trail map"/> Despite the comparative closeness of the checkpoints and the location of a dog drop between them, this is considered the most difficult stretch of dog sled trail in the world.<ref>Killick, p. 246</ref> At this point, mushers must climb the two steepest and most difficult mountains on the trail: Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit.<ref name="Trail map"/>

After leaving Central, mushers head west, paralleling the [[Steese Highway]], which connects Central and Circle with Fairbanks. The trail travels through frozen swamps, mining areas, and firebreaks for about {{convert|20|mi|km}}. Mushers then encounter the Steese Highway for a second time before crossing several creeks to begin the ascent of Eagle Summit.<ref name="datrail4"/> They eventually climb above the [[tree line]] and are exposed to the wind as they continue upward. The weather atop Eagle Summit is harsh as this is a [[convergence zone]] between the [[Yukon Flats]] to the north and the low ground of the [[Tanana Valley]] to the south. A differential in the weather within the two valleys causes high winds and precipitation when there is moisture in the atmosphere.<ref>Balzar, p. 253</ref> The final few hundred yards of the climb consists of a 30-degree slope often scoured to bare rock and [[tundra]] by the fierce wind.<ref>Balzar, pp. 252&ndash;254</ref> The crossing point itself is a symmetrical [[Mountain pass|saddle]], with two peaks of similar height separated by {{convert|100|yd|m|0}}.<ref>Killick, pp. 246&ndash;247</ref> The south side of Eagle Summit is not as steep, and mushers generally have an easier time reaching the dog drop at Mile 101.<ref name="datrail4"/> When descending the steep northern slope of Eagle Summit on the Fairbanks<U+2013>Whitehorse route, many mushers wrap their sled runners in [[chain]]s to increase [[friction]] and slow the plunge.<ref>Killick, p. 249</ref> 

[[Image:Eagle Summit Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A view of a valley from a barren mountain summit with brown and yellow ground covering|The eastern slope of Eagle Summit, seen in August 2008 looking north]]

The Mile 101 dog drop is a cabin at mile marker 101 (the distance from Fairbanks) on the Steese Highway. The cabin gives mushers the opportunity for a short rest between Eagle Summit and Rosebud Summit.<ref>Killick, p. 254</ref> The ascent of Rosebud Summit begins about {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of the dog drop. It consists of a gradual climb of {{convert|5|mi|km}} followed by a steep descent into the valley that contains the north fork of the Chena River. The descent also brings mushers back into forested terrain.<ref>Killick, p. 256</ref> The trail then parallels a road for about {{convert|27|mi|km|0}} before entering the final checkpoint at Twin Bears Campground near Two Rivers.<ref name="datrail4"/>

=== Two Rivers to Fairbanks ===
[[Image:Twin Bears Campground.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Scattered cabins are seen behind a lake with ice floating on its surface|Twin Bears Campground, seen here in spring, was the Two Rivers checkpoint in the 2009 race.]]
Two Rivers is the final checkpoint in the Whitehorse<U+2013>Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks.<ref name="Killick261">Killick, p. 261</ref> The greatest challenge for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, many of which have similar markings.<ref>Balzar, p. 276</ref> Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.<ref name="Killick261"/><ref>O'Donoghue, p. 312</ref>

Beyond Two Rivers the trail reaches the [[Chena River]] northwest of Fairbanks. This is the final stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach the finish line,<ref name="Killick262">Killick, p. 262</ref> which is on the river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of the timing of the finish, several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross the finish line.<ref name="Killick262"/>

=== Route changes ===
The 1984 route was slightly different from today's. It had just one non-checkpoint dog drop, at the Mile 101 location,<ref name="Firth237">Firth, p. 237</ref> and bypassed American Summit, Pelly Junction, and Braeburn. Instead of running through Braeburn, mushers traveled across [[Lake Laberge]] for {{convert|60|mi|km}} between Whitehorse and Minto.<ref>Firth, p. 279</ref> The inaugural race also included a checkpoint at [[Chena Hot Springs, Alaska|Chena Hot Springs Resort]] near Fairbanks. This site was moved to nearby Angel Creek after mushers complained that the hot springs melted nearby snow, causing their dogs to become wet<U+2014>an extreme hazard in sub-freezing temperatures.<ref>Firth, p. 19</ref> Two additional dog drops were added for the 1994 race: Biederman's Cabin (since replaced by Slaven's Cabin) and McCabe Creek.<ref name="Firth237"/> In 1995 the Whitehorse end of the trail was moved away from Lake Laberge to near the Takhini River.<ref>Firth, pp. 237&ndash;238</ref> Additional changes that year included the rerouting of the trail around the southern and eastern sides of King Solomon's Dome south of Dawson City<ref name="Firth238">Firth, p. 238</ref> and the introduction of the Scroggie Creek dog drop site on the shore of the Stewart River.<ref name="Firth237"/>

In 1996, the trail was rerouted through Pelly Crossing and a checkpoint was added there, and the Lake Laberge stretch was replaced by a route through Braeburn and along the Dawson-Whitehorse Overland Trail.<ref name="Firth238"/> In 1997, mushers were routed through the [[Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project]] and to the Alaska town of [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]] before continuing on to Fairbanks.<ref>Firth, p. 240</ref> The North Pole loop was removed before the 2009 race, and mushers were directed through [[Two Rivers, Alaska|Two Rivers]] instead.<ref>Willomitzer, Gerry.

== Weather ==
The Yukon Quest trail is in the [[subarctic climate]] range. In Fairbanks, the average February temperature is {{convert|-3.8|F|C|0}}, but {{convert|-40|F|C|0}} is not uncommon, and temperatures have dropped to {{convert|-58|F|C|0}}.<ref name="Fairbanks weather">Alaska Climate Research Center.

=== Entry requirements ===
Competitors must meet a series of written and unwritten requirements before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants have been known to lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Jamaican Newton Marshall borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt.<ref>Saari, Matias.

Those who have completed at least {{convert|500|mi|km|0}} of Quest-sanctioned racing are eligible to send in an entry form. This requires entrants to certify that they are older than 18, have not been censured by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and have never been convicted of animal abuse or neglect.<ref name="Rules1"/> They must pay $1,500 or $2,000 for late entries.<ref name="Rules1"/>

Many of the Quest's rules are intended to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate.<ref name="vet check"/> Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.<ref name="Rules6"/> 

Mushers must start the race with at most fourteen dogs and finish with no fewer than six.<ref name="Rules6"/> Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden.<ref name="Rules7">''2009 Yukon Quest Rules'', p. 7</ref> Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be under the influence of performance-enhancing substances such as [[steroid]]s. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care.<ref name="Rules7"/>

=== Penalties ===
The Yukon Quest's rules allow race officials latitude on whether to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations.<ref name="Rules2">''2009 Yukon Quest Rules'', p. 2</ref> The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed.<ref>Saari, Matias. [http://newsminer.com/news/2008/feb/11/quest-legend-turner-scratches-leaving-22-mushers-c/ "Quest legend Turner scratches, leaving 22 mushers competing"], ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''. February 11, 2008. Accessed February 23, 2009.</ref> More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records.<ref name="oddrules"/> These minor penalties can have an effect on the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Steese Highway.<ref>Saari, Matias. [http://newsminer.com/news/2009/feb/23/second-place-yukon-quest-hugh-neff-penalized-two-h/ "Second-place Yukon Quest musher Hugh Neff is penalized two hours"], ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''. February 23, 2009. Accessed February 24, 2009.</ref> As a result, he finished four minutes behind [[Sebastian Schnuelle]], the winner.<ref name="2009race">Saari, Matias.

In addition to the main 1,000-mile sled dog race, the Yukon Quest organization operates two shorter races: the Junior Yukon Quest and the Yukon Quest 300.<ref name="otherraces">Yukon Quest International. [http://www.yukonquest.com/site/other-yukon-quest-races/ "Other Yukon Quest races"], Yukonquest.com. Accessed February 23, 2009.</ref> The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the Quest 300 was only 250&nbsp;miles and thus known as the Quest 250.<ref name="2001race"/>

=== Junior Yukon Quest ===
The Junior Yukon Quest, or Junior Quest, is a 135-mile (217&nbsp;km) race for mushers older than 14 but under 18.<ref>Staff Report. [http://newsminer.com/news/2009/feb/07/six-mushers-set-race-jr-quest/ "Six mushers set to race in Jr. Quest"], ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''. February 7, 2009. Accessed February 23, 2009.</ref> Unlike the Yukon Quest, the Junior Quest does not change locations and always starts and ends in Fairbanks.<ref name="2001race"/> It is billed as an opportunity for young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300.<ref name="otherraces"/>

=== Yukon Quest 300 ===
The Yukon Quest 300 is a 300-mile (483&nbsp;km) race along the regular Yukon Quest trail. It alternates starting locations along with the main race and is intended for less-experienced mushers training for longer races. The race is also a qualifier for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the following year's Yukon Quest. Several mushers, including [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] [[Alaska Native|Native]] Josh Cadzow, have used the race as a trial before entering the longer races.<ref>Saari, Matias.

Accessed February 23, 2009.</ref>

In 2009, the race was capped at 25 entries.<ref name="Quest300fill">Saari, Matias. [http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/oct/29/mushers-quickly-fill-yukon-quest-300/ "Mushers quickly fill Yukon Quest 300"], ''Fairbanks Daily News-Miner''. October 29, 2008. Accessed February 23, 2009.</ref> When the Quest 300 starts in Whitehorse, its course follows the main Yukon Quest trail until the Stepping Stone hospitality stop. From there, it turns southwest, ending in Minto Landing, Yukon.<ref name="Quest300fill"/> The Fairbanks route follows the main trail to Circle, then reverses course, ending in Central.<ref name="Quest300fill"/>
