'''Edward Bodkin''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Cutter (body modification)|cutter]] (underground surgical practitioner) who was arrested in 1998 after police were tipped off that he was performing and videotaping voluntary human [[castration]]s at his home.

Bodkin, an only child who had grown up on a farm near [[Kokomo, Indiana]], began advertising his services in the short-lived ''Ball Club Quarterly'' magazine, and castrated his "clients" in exchange for their permission to videotape the procedures. While voluntary chemical or surgical castration is legal for repeat [[sex offender]]s in certain US states, for individuals undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], and for other medical reasons, in otherwise healthy individuals a desire for castration is often viewed as [[psychotic]].

The Huntington, Indiana, county prosecutor charged Bodkin with practicing medicine without a license,( a Class C [[felony]] that made him eligible for thousands in fines and up to eight years in prison. He ultimately admitted to performing five castrations (he also kept "the trophies," in jars labelled with dates, initials, and an L or R). On April 12, 1999, Judge Mark McIntosh sentenced Bodkin to four years in jail, with two-and-a-half years suspended and credit for 69 days served. In a prepared statement, Bodkin said:

{{cquote|I felt it prudent to spare the court unnecessary time considerations and graphic details regarding this case. Such details might be repugnant to some and a source of folly for others ... My activities were conducted at the specific request of the parties ... to absolve emotional, psychological or physical needs ... not merely the spurious fancy of some alternate lifestyle.}}
