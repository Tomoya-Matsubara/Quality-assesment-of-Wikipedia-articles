'''''Cars''''' is a 2006 American animated [[family film]] produced by [[Pixar]] and directed by both [[John Lasseter]] and [[Joe Ranft]]. It is the seventh Disney<U+00B7>Pixar feature film, and Pixar's final, independently-produced motion picture before its purchase by Disney. Set in a world populated entirely by [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cars and other vehicles, it features voices by [[Owen Wilson]], [[Paul Newman]] (in his final non-documentary feature), [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Jenifer Lewis]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[George Carlin]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]] and [[Michael Keaton]] as well as voice [[cameo appearance|cameos]] by several celebrities including [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]] of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', [[Richard Petty]], [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], [[Bob Costas]], [[Darrell Waltrip]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Michael Schumacher]], [[Tom Magliozzi|Tom]] and [[Ray Magliozzi]] from [[National Public Radio|NPR's]] ''[[Car Talk]]'', and [[Mario Andretti]]. The film is also the second Pixar<U+2014>after ''[[A Bug's Life]]''<U+2014>to have an entirely non-human cast.

''Cars'' premiered on May 26, 2006 at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]], North Carolina, and was released on June 9, 2006, to generally favorable reviews. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], including [[Best Animated Feature]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]]. It was released on DVD November 7, 2006 and on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in late 2007. Related merchandise, including scale models of several of the cars, broke records for retail sales of merchandise based on a Disney<U+00B7>Pixar film, with an estimated $5&nbsp;billion in sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/business/media/06pixar.html?_r=4&hpw=&pagewanted=all |title=Pixar<U+2019>s Art Leaves Profit Watchers Edgy |author=Brooks Barnes |work=The New York Times |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref>

==Plot==
''Cars'' takes place in a world populated by [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] motor vehicles. The film begins with the last race of the Piston Cup championship, which ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran [[Strip Weathers]], perennial runner-up [[Chick Hicks]], and rookie [[Lightning McQueen]]. The [[tiebreaker]] race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway. Lightning is desperate to win the race, as it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a rust treatment for old cars, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, Lightning pushes his [[Semi-trailer truck|big rig]], [[Mack (Cars)|Mack]], to travel all night long. While McQueen sleeps, the exhausted Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of [[The Delinquent Road Hazards|reckless street racers]], causing McQueen to fall out the back of the truck. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic, and speeds off the highway to find Mack, ending up in the run-down town of Radiator Springs and inadvertently tearing up the pavement of its main road.

After being arrested and impounded overnight, McQueen is ordered by the town's judge and doctor, [[Doc Hudson]], to leave town immediately. The local lawyer [[Sally Carrera]] insists that McQueen be given [[community service]] to repave the road, which Doc agrees. McQueen tries to repave it quickly in a day, but the job is shoddy and McQueen is forced to restart the job again, taking several days to complete. During this time, he becomes friends with several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs was once a popular stopover along [[U.S. Route 66]], but with the construction of a highway nearby that bypassed the town, it effectively was erased from the map. McQueen also discovers Doc is really the [[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]], a three-time Piston Cup winner forced out of racing after an accident, and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends an extra day in town with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered himself.

At the speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully on the race, and soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc Hudson, decked out in his Fabulous Hudson Hornet markings, has taken over as his racing chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. Hicks, refusing to lose, sends Weathers into a dangerous accident. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media snub Hicks' victory and give praise to McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with his current sponsors as appreciate of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will set up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.

==Production==
''Cars'' is the last film worked on by [[Joe Ranft]], who died in a car crash in 2005. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after ''[[Corpse Bride]]''. This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for [[Paul Newman]] before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. It turned out to be the highest-grossing film of his career.

===Development===
The original script (called ''The Yellow Car'', about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world), some of the original drawings and characters were produced in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars could be the next movie after ''A Bug's Life'' and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the movie was eventually scrapped in favor of ''[[Toy Story 2]]''. Later, production resumed with major script changes.

[[John Lasseter]] has said that the idea for ''Cars'' was born after he took a cross-country road trip with his wife and five sons in 2000. When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted [[Michael Wallis]], a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In 2001, the movie's working title was ''Route 66'' (after [[U.S. Route 66]]), but in 2002, the title was changed to prevent people from thinking it was related to the 1960 [[Route 66 (TV series)|television show with the same name]]. In addition, Lightning McQueen's number was originally going to be 57 (Lasseter's birth year), but was changed to 95 (the year ''[[Toy Story]]'' was released).

===Animation===
[[File:carsanimation.png|thumb|Work-in-progress screenshot.]]
For the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company. Lasseter learned how real cars were designed.

Unlike most [[anthropomorphic]] cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the [[Tonka]] Talking Trucks, and the characters from [[Tex Avery]]'s ''One Cab's Family'' short and Disney's own ''[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe]]''), rather than within the headlights. According to [[production designer]] Bob Pauley, "From the very beginning of this project, [[John Lasseter]] had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adisney.go.com/disneypictures/cars/us/bios/CARSProdNotes.pdf |title=Cars Production Information |date=May 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009 |format=pdf}}</ref>
The characters also use their tires as hands and feet, the exceptions being the various tow truck characters that sometimes use their tow hooks, and the various forklift characters, which use their forks. Some cars are showing shuffling sideways by moving their wheels about on their suspensions.

Computers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and 1,000 times faster than those used in ''[[Toy Story]]''. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms very similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/automobiles/21AUTO.html?pagewanted=all |title=Pixar's ''Cars'' Got Its Kicks on Route 66 |accessdate=April 11, 2009 |author=Phil Patton |date=May 21, 2006 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Settings===
The track on which the opening race (Motor Speedway of the South) takes place is based on an enlarged version of [[Bristol Motor Speedway]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The venue for the Piston Cup tiebreaker race (the Los Angeles International Speedway) is a conglomeration of the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] in Pasadena where the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] is located, as well as the [[Auto Club Speedway]] in Fontana. The Scoring Pylon (showing numbers 43, 86, and 95) is taken from the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]].

The sign "City of Emeryville&nbsp;<U+2013> Closed for the race" is a nod to [[Pixar]]'s headquarters in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

====Radiator Springs and vicinity====
The setting for the fictional town of Radiator Springs is situated between [[Gallup, New Mexico|Gallup]], New Mexico and the [[Sonoran Desert]] in California. However, the physical location of Radiator Springs in relation to [[I-40]] is similar to that of [[Peach Springs, Arizona|Peach Springs]], Arizona.

Lasseter told film critic [[Joe Williams (film critic)|Joe Williams]] of the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] that much of the story is based on the recollections of barber Angel Delgadillo in the Route 66 town of [[Seligman, Arizona|Seligman]], Arizona, where business withered soon after the opening of I-40.

Willy's Butte resembles the landmark of [[Mexican Hat, Utah|Mexican Hat]], Utah, but also resembles a classic [[Pontiac]] hood ornament.

There is an "Ornament Valley" (a reference to [[Monument Valley]]).

The [[epilogue]] shows a map of the area of [[Arizona]] around Radiator Springs, including car-related place names such as "Carburetor County" and "Cadillac Range". The latter is a north-to-south mountain range with many fin-backed jagged peaks, a reference to the famous [[Cadillac Ranch]] sculpture in [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], Texas.

Lizzie's Curio Shop in Radiator Springs resembles the crazy Route 66 jumble of memorabilia and [[wikt:knick-knack|knick-knacks]] at Hackberry General Store in Hackberry, Arizona and the Sand Hills Curiosity Shop, aka the City Meat Market building in [[Erick, Oklahoma|Erick]], Oklahoma.

The bridge that McQueen sees Sally driving on resembles several bridges on Route 66, including the [[Cyrus Avery]] Route 66 Memorial Bridge in [[Tulsa]], the [[Colorado Street Bridge (Pasadena, California)|Colorado Street Bridge]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California, and the now-closed bridge over Diablo Canyon at [[Two Guns, Arizona|Two Guns]], Arizona.

Flo's V8 cafe is designed to look like a [[V8 engine]] head on, with a circular air filter, tappet covers, spark plugs, pistons and connecting rods as the supports for the shelter. The blinking neon lights on the spark plugs blink in the firing order of a Ford [[Flathead engine|flathead]] V8.<ref name="lagreasegeek" />

The railroad [[grade crossing]] at which Lightning McQueen outruns a passenger train on his way to Radiator Springs is protected by a pair of antique "upper-quadrant" [[wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] crossing signals which accurately depict those once made by the [[Magnetic Signal Company]] in both appearance and start-up. Few are left in actual operation in the United States, and many have been replaced with modern crossing gates, red lights and bells.

====Continuity====
During the closing credits, the characters are at a drive-in watching clips of the Pixar films "Toy Car Story" (''[[Toy Story]]''), "Monster Trucks, Inc." (''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'') and ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', whose characters have been rendered as vehicles in the style of ''Cars''.

There are a few sights of the front page of a newspaper named ''The Daily Exhaust''.

====Route 66====
Many characters and places in the movie are directly inspired by real [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] places and people.

To quote the Pixar crew:

:"As we traveled on Route 66, we were privileged to visit many places and to meet a number of people who live and work alongside 'The Mother Road.' The following is a list of the places and people we wanted to honor by including their names in our 'Special Thanks' credits at the end of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rwarn17588.wordpress.com/2006/06/13/pixars-route-66-inspirations/ |title=Pixar's Route 66 inspirations |publisher=Route 66 News |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref>

Among the many references to Route 66 landmarks and personalities:
* The Cozy Cone Motel's design is based on the two [[Wigwam Motel]]s along Rt. 66, in [[Holbrook, Arizona|Holbrook]], Arizona and [[Rialto, California|Rialto]], California. These were once two out of seven built motels, with individual cabins shaped like teepees. Three Wigwam Motels remain; the third (and oldest) is in Cave City, Kentucky, far from Route 66. The recently restored Tee Pee Motel in Wharton, Texas, south of Houston, is of similar design but unrelated. The name "Cozy Cone" was inspired by the Cozy Dog Drive-In of Springfield, Illinois, which lays claim to being birthplace of the [[corn dog]].
* The character "Fillmore", referring to the famous San Francisco music venue [[The Fillmore]], was at one time to be named "Waldmire" after [[Bob Waldmire]], a self-proclaimed [[hippie]] artist known to Rt. 66 fans for his detailed pen-and-ink maps and postcards of the route. Though Waldmire's family owns the Cozy Dog Drive-In, Bob, having since become a [[vegan]], preferred not to see his name put on a character that would become a McDonald's Happy Meal toy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0608150331aug16,1,7590549.story?coll=chi-news-hed/ |title=Birthplace (maybe) of the corn dog |author=Charles Storch |work=Chicago Tribune |date=August 16, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref>
* Ramone's House of Body Art is based primarily on the [[U-Drop Inn]] in [[Shamrock, Texas|Shamrock]], Texas. It opened in 1936 as Tower [[Conoco]] (from its distinctive [[Art Deco]] spire) with the U-Drop Inn Cafe and a retail building attached. Many other establishments built along Route 66 in its heyday had Art Deco elements that might be reflected in the design of Ramone's.
* The yellow billboard for Lizzie's Curio Shop reading "HERE IT IS" with an image of a Model T is based on the [[Jack Rabbit Trading Post]] signage in Joseph City, Arizona.
* Sheriff is voiced by [[Michael Wallis]], an American historian and author of ''Route 66: The Mother Road''.

===Cameo===
The group of small birds from the 2001 Pixar short film ''[[For the Birds (film)|For the Birds]]'' made a [[cameo appearance]] in Cars. As Mack is en route to California at 17:44 in the film, the group of small birds can briefly be seen (and heard) sitting on their familiar telephone wire. In addition, the Pizza Planet truck from ''Toy Story'' also makes a cameo outside of the race track, at the final race in the movie.<ref>{{cite video | title = Cars | medium = DVD | publisher=Disney/Pixar |date = 2007}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Cars (soundtrack)}}
The [[Cars (soundtrack)|''Cars'' soundtrack]] was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 6, 2006. Nine tracks on the soundtrack are by popular artists, while the remaining eleven are score cues by [[Randy Newman]]. It has two versions of the classic [[Bobby Troup]] jazz standard "[[Route 66 (song)|Route 66]]" (popularized by [[Nat King Cole]]), one by [[Chuck Berry]] and a new version recorded specifically for the film's credits performed by [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]]. [[Brad Paisley]] contributed two of the nine tracks to the album, one being "Find Yourself" used for the end credits.

==Release==
''Cars'' was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004 the movie's release date was changed to June 9, 2006.<ref name="BBCJobs">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/entertainment/film/4078711.stm |title=Pixar-Disney delay Cars release |publisher=BBC News  |date=December 8, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios, or they were buying time to see what happened with Michael Eisner's situation at Disney.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars  |work=Business Week  |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2007}}</ref>  When Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a Summer release schedule, with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season.<ref name="BBCJobs" />

===Critical reception===
''Cars'' opened on June 9, 2006 to generally positive reviews. William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' praised it as "one of Pixar's most imaginative and thoroughly appealing movies ever"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/273246_cars09q.html |title=''Cars'' is a joyous ride |author=William Arnold |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=June 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref> and Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it "a work of American art as classic as it is modern."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/movie/0,6115,1201791_1_0_,00.html |title=Cars {{!}} Movie Review |author=Lisa Schwarzbaum |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 7, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref>

Some critics expressed that ''Cars'' did not hold up to the standard of other [[Pixar]] films due to its lengthy story, especially after the acclaim received by ''[[The Incredibles]]'', Pixar's previous film. "The movie is great to look at and a lot of fun," wrote critic [[Roger Ebert]], "but somehow lacks the extra push of the other Pixar films."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060608/REVIEWS/60606002/1023 |title=Cars :: Reviews |author=Roger Ebert |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=June 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref> Laura Clifford of website Reeling Reviews wrote that the film's "only real drawback is its failure to inspire awe with its visuals and to thoroughly transport with its storytelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelingreviews.com/cars.htm#Laura |title=Reeling: Cars |publisher=The Movie Review Show |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref>

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave Cars a fresh 74% (with an average of 6.9),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cars/|title=Cars (2006) on Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref> yet no other Pixar Film has ever scored less than 91%, but it still received a "Certified Fresh" rating, and it earned a 73/100 on Metacritic, both the lowest attributed to a Pixar film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars|title=Metecritic: Cars|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref>

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, ''Cars'' $60,119,509 in 3,985 theaters in the United States ranking number one at the box office. In the United States, the film held onto the No.1 spot for two weeks before being surpassed by ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' and then by ''[[Superman Returns]]'' the following weekend. It went on to gross $461,981,604 worldwide (ranking number 6 in 2006 films) and $244,082,982 in the United States (the third highest-grossing film of 2006 in the country, behind ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Night at the Museum]]''). It was the highest-grossing animated film of 2006 in the United States, but lost to ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' in worldwide totals.<ref name="BOM">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cars.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |title=Cars (2006) |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref>

===Awards===
{{main|List of awards and nominations received by Cars}}
''Cars'' had a highly successful run during the 2006 awards season.

The [[United States Department of Transportation]] has used scenes from the movie in a commercial regarding the [[Click It or Ticket]] campaign.

In conjunction with the film's release, a chocolate [[ice cream]] on a stick resembling a car [[tire]] was released in Australia. These ice creams were called "Burnouts". The naming of the particular product sparked controversy as the name "Burnouts" was believed to have encouraged [[street racing]] and committing burnouts. These acts are illegal and heavy fines and convictions are issued to those committing these acts in Australia. It is unknown as to whether the products have been discontinued.

In Norway, the candy company Nidar produced candy with the characters on the outer packaging and pictures of the characters on the packaging of the assorted candy on the inside. These bags also came with ''Cars'' themed tattoos.
