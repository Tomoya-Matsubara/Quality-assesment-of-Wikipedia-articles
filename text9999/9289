'''Emeric''', also known as '''Imre''' ({{lang-hu|Imre}}, {{lang-hr|Emerik}}, {{lang-sk|Imrich}}; 1174{{spaced ndash}}30 November 1204), was [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]] between 1196 and 1204. In 1184, his father, [[B<U+00E9>la III of Hungary]], ordered that he be crowned king, and appointed him as ruler of [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102<U+2013>1526)|Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] around 1195. Emeric ascended the throne after the death of his father. During the first four years of his reign, he fought his rebellious brother, [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew]], who forced Emeric to make him ruler of Croatia and Dalmatia as an [[appanage]]. 

Emeric cooperated with the [[Holy See]] against the [[Bosnia]]n [[Bosnian Church|Patarenes]], whom the Catholic Church considered to be heretics. Taking advantage of a civil war, Emeric expanded his [[suzerainty]] over [[Serbia]]. He failed to prevent the [[Republic of Venice]], which was assisted by crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]], from seizing [[Zadar]] in 1202. He also could not impede the rise of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] along the southern frontiers of his kingdom. Emeric was the first Hungarian monarch to use the "[[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d stripes]]" as his personal coat of arms and to adopt the title of [[King of Serbia]]. Before his death, Emeric had his four-year-old son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus III]], crowned king. 

==Early life (1174<U+2013>1196)==

Emeric was the eldest child of [[B<U+00E9>la III of Hungary]] and B<U+00E9>la's first wife, [[Agnes of Antioch]].{{sfn|Makk|1994|p=282}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=225}} His tutor was an Italian priest, [[Bernard, Archbishop of Spalato|Bernard]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=225}} [[Nicholas, Archbishop of Esztergom]] crowned the eight-year-old Emeric king on 16 May 1182, which confirmed Emeric's right to succeed his father.{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=114}} Emeric was betrothed to a daughter of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]], but she died in 1184.{{sfn|Makk|1989|p=116}} B<U+00E9>la III appointed Emeric to administer [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102<U+2013>1526)|Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] around 1195.{{sfn|Makk|1994|p=282}}{{sfn|Berend|Urba<U+0144>czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=178}}

===Struggles with his brother (1196<U+2013>1200)===

Emeric succeeded his father, who died on 23 April 1196.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=225}}{{sfn|Berend|Urba<U+0144>czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=178}} B<U+00E9>la III had bequeathed estates and money to Emeric's younger brother, [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew]], under the condition that Andrew should lead a crusade to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Berend|Urba<U+0144>czyk|Wiszewski|2013|pp=178, 234}} Instead, Andrew turned against Emeric, demanding a separate duchy for himself in 1197.{{sfn|Berend|Urba<U+0144>czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=234}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=22}} [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]], intervened on behalf of Andrew, and at the end of the year, their combined forces routed Emeric's troops at [[Ma<U+010D>ki, Slavonia]].{{sfn|Makk|1994|p=282}}{{sfn|Seb<U+0151>k|1994|p=421}} In early 1198, Emeric was forced to make Andrew Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia as an [[appanage]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=22}}{{sfn|Maga<U+0161>|2007|p=58}} 

Andrew continued to conspire against Emeric, although [[Pope Innocent III]] continued urging Andrew to launch a crusade.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=225}}{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=124}} On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced [[Boleslaus, Bishop of V<U+00E1>c]], who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that proved the conspiracy against him.{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}} In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near [[Lake Balaton]], which made Andrew flee to [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Seb<U+0151>k|1994|p=565}} A [[papal legate]] named Gregory arrived in Hungary to mediate a reconciliation between the two brothers.{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}}{{sfn|Berend|Urba<U+0144>czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=392}} According to the brothers' treaty, Emeric once again granted Croatia and Dalmatia to Andrew in the summer of 1200.{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}}

===Wars in the Balkans (1200<U+2013>1203)===

From around 1200, Emeric was deeply involved in the affairs of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=88}} On 11 October 1200, Pope Innocent urged him to take measures to liquidate the [[Church of Bosnia|"heretics" in Bosnia]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=88<U+2013>89}}{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}} Upon Emeric's request, the Pope refused to send a royal crown to [[Stephen Nemanji<U+0107>]], [[Grand Prince of Serbia]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=389}} Emeric invaded Serbia in 1201 or 1202, and helped Stephen Nemanji<U+0107>'s brother, [[Vukan Nemanji<U+0107> of Serbia|Vukan]] seize the throne.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=389}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=47<U+2013>48}} As a token of his [[suzerainty]] over Serbia, Emeric became the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title of [[King of Serbia]] in 1202.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=88}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=47<U+2013>48}} He was also the first king to use a royal seal depicting the so-called "[[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d stripes]]", which eventually became part of the [[Coat of arms of Hungary]] in that year.{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=126}}

In the summer of 1202, [[Enrico Dandolo]], [[Doge of Venice]], signed a treaty with the leaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]], who agreed to help the Venetians recapture [[Zadar]], a town in Dalmatia, which had accepted the Hungarian monarchs' suzerainty since 1186.{{sfn|McNeal|Wolff|1969|pp=167<U+2013>168}}{{sfn|Maga<U+0161>|2007|p=57}} Even though Pope Innocent III forbade the crusaders to besiege Zadar, [[Siege of Zara|they seized the town]] on 24 November and gave it to the Venetians.{{sfn|McNeal|Wolff|1969|p=168}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=61}} Although the Pope excommunicated the Venetians and the crusaders upon Emeric's demand, Zadar remained under Venetian rule.{{sfn|McNeal|Wolff|1969|p=175}}{{sfn|Maga<U+0161>|2007|p=57}}

In fear of a crusade by Emeric, [[Ban Kulin|Kulin]], [[Ban of Bosnia]], held a synod of the [[Church of Bosnia]] at [[Zenica|Bilino Polje]] on 6 April 1203.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=47}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=433}} The synod acknowledged [[papal primacy]] and ordered the reform of the rites.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=47}} Ban Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's suzerainty.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=47}} In a letter written in 1203, [[Kaloyan]], [[Tzar of Bulgaria]], informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=55}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=383}}

===Last years (1203<U+2013>1204)===

Duke Andrew once again rose up in open rebellion against Emeric in the autumn of 1203.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=226}} Their armies met at Vara<U+017E>din on the river [[Dr<U+00E1>va]] in October.{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=126}} Emeric walked into his brother's camp unarmed, stating, "Now I shall see who will dare to raise a hand to shed the blood of the royal lineage!",<ref name=Thomas_of_Split_23_143>''Archdeacon Thomas of Split: History of the Bishops of Salona and Split'' (ch. 23.), p. 143.</ref> according to the nearly contemporaneous [[Thomas the Archdeacon]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=226}} Nobody ventured to stop the king; thus, he approached Andrew and seized him without resistance.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=226}}{{sfn|Makk|1994|p=283}} Duke Andrew was held in captivity for months, but his supporters released him in early 1204.{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=126}} 

Taking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, Kaloyan invaded and captured [[Belgrade]], [[Brani<U+010D>evo (Golubac)|Barancs]] (now Brani<U+010D>evo in Serbia), and other fortresses.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=55}} Emeric made preparations for a campaign against Bulgaria, but he disbanded his army upon Pope Innocent's demand.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=383}} The Pope, who had been negotiating a [[church union]] with Kaloyan, sent a royal crown to him, but Emeric imprisoned the papal legate who was delivering the crown to Bulgaria when the legate was passing through Hungary.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=383}}  

Having fallen seriously ill, Emeric had his four-year-old son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus]], crowned king on 26 August 1204.{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}} He also released the papal legate. He reconciled with his brother, "entrusting to him the guardianship of his son and the administration of the entire kingdom until the ward should reach the age of majority",<ref name=Thomas_of_Split_23_143/> according to Thomas the Archdeacon.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=226}}{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}} Emeric died on 30 November, according to the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]''.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=226}}{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}} Emeric was buried in the cathedral of [[Eger]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=226}}<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 172.123), p. 139.</ref>
