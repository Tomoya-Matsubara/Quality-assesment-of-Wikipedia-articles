'''Hellmuth Reinhard''' (born July 24, 1911) was head of the [[Gestapo]] in [[Norway]] (1942<U+2013>1945), and was partly responsible for the deportation of at least 532 Norwegian Jews and was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment in 1967 as an accessory to murder.<ref>[http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9329504 Reinhard - CAPLEX]</ref>

== Early years ==
Reinhard was born [[Hermann Gustav Hellmuth Patzschke]] on July 24, 1911 in [[Unterwerschen]], [[Kreis Weissenfels]], [[Bezirk Halle]] in Saxony.  In 1913 his family moved to Leipzig. From 1929 he was member of the [[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]] (Hitler Youth).  He then studied in [[Vienna|Wienna]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Berlin]].<ref>Ibid</ref>

== Nazi official ==
He became a member of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in March 1933 (121174) and a member of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] in May of the same year (2.382.157).<ref>Bundesarchiv, SS-file</ref>  The SS was at that time an organisation which recruited younger men distancing themselves from the "hoodlom character of the [[SA]] and the party and who looked upon the SS as an elite order, spiritually and politically"<ref>Herbert, Ulrich: Best: Biographische Studien <U+00FC>ber Radikalismus, Weltanschauung und Vernunft, 1903-1989, Bonn, Dietz, 1989, p. 119, translated from the German</ref> 

In 1934 he became a member of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], the intelligence service of the SS and the NSDAP.  He became leader of the ''[[SD-Hauptamt, Partei und Staat]]'' in 1938.  Appointed "Regierungsassesor" in the same year. On 25 April 1939 he changed his last name to Reinhard.  During the war he was stationed in [[Prague]], then later on, in August 1941, he became leader of the ''[[Zentralstelle f<U+00FC>r judische Auswanderung]]'' in [[Holland]].  For approximately three months during 1941/42 he was in the [[Einsatzgruppe]] C, whereupon he went to [[Norway]] in order to become head of the [[Gestapo]], Abteilung IV,  from 28 January 1942, working under the leader of the Sicherheitspolizei in Norway, [[Heinrich Fehils]].  He remained in this position until 1 February 1945.

== Post-war years ==
After the war he changed his name back to his original one, which enabled him to avoid further scrutiny from authorities regarding his activities at the time in question.  Only in 1964, his true identity became known to the West German police and he was prosecuted in 1967. Released in 1970. Presumed dead in 2001.
