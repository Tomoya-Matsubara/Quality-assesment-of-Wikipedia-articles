'''Lisa del Giocondo''' ([[June 15]] [[1479]] &ndash; [[July 15]] [[1542]] or c. [[1551]]), born and also known as '''Lisa Gherardini''', '''Lisa di Antonio Maria (Antonmaria) Gherardini''' and '''Elisabetta Gherardini''', also known as '''Lisa del Gioconda''', was a member of the Gherardini family of [[Florence]] and [[Tuscany]] in [[Italy]]. Her name, ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', was given to her [[portrait painting|portrait]] which was commissioned by her husband and painted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Little is known about Lisa's life. Married as a teenager, she was mother to five children and led what is thought to have been a comfortable and ordinary middle-class life. Lisa outlived her husband who became a local elected official and who was about twenty years her senior.

Hundreds of years after her death, her portrait took on a life separate from Lisa, the woman. For much of the 20th century, popular and scholarly speculation made ''Mona Lisa'' an [[icon]], an object of ridicule and commercialization<ref name=Sassoon /> and the "world's most famous painting".<ref>{{cite news|author=Riding, Alan|title=In Louvre, New Room With View of 'Mona Lisa'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/06/arts/design/06lisa.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=[[April 6]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> A researcher's discovery during the early 21st century was powerful enough evidence to end speculation about the sitter's identity, and finally reunited Lisa's portrait with her person.<ref>{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Researchers Identify Model for Mona Lisa|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-Art-Mona-Who.html|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

==Life and family==
[[Image:Leonardo design attributed.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Another view of Lisa in a cartoon for ''Mona Lisa'' attributed to Leonardo]]
Lisa was the daughter of Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini and Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de Carducci who married in 1466. The family had income from nearby farmland and lived in Florence near 
[[Santa Trinita]] and also had a small country home about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} south of the city, in St. Donato in the village of Poggio. When their city home was damaged the family moved to rented space near [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Santo Spirito]].<ref name=Zoellner />

On [[March 5]] [[1495]], Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo (1460<U+2013>1528 or c. 1539<ref name=Zoellner />), a modestly successful [[textile|cloth]] and [[silk]] merchant, becoming his third wife at the age of fifteen. Camilla di Mariotto Rucellai, whom he married in 1491, and Tommasa di Mariotto Villani, whom he married in 1493, both may have died in childbirth. Lisa's dowry was land near her family's country home and 170 [[Italian coin florin|florins]], a sign the Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and one reason to think she and her husband may have loved each other. The couple lived a middle-class life, neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence. Lisa's marriage may have increased her [[social status]] somewhat because her husband's family was better off financially.<ref name=Zoellner /> Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an "old name".<ref name=Kemp />

[[Image:Ponte vecchio-arno-florence-np.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Florence]] today. Francesco and Lisa lived on Via della Stufa next door to his family's old house, about {{convert|.53|mi|km|0}} north (left) of the [[Arno River]]. Lisa's parents lived closer to the river, at first north and later south.]]

Leonardo is thought to have started to paint Lisa's portrait the same year.<ref name=Louvre /> In 1512 during fears the Medici  would return from exile, Francesco was imprisoned, fined 1,000 florins, and released in September when the Medici  returned to Florence.

By one account by an amateur scholar, Francesco died in the plague of [[1528]].

Like other Florentines of their financial means, Francesco's family were art lovers and patrons<U+2014>the family's burial site in the [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze]] gained a painting through the efforts of his son Bartolommeo, and [[Andrea del Sarto]] painted a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for another member of his family.<ref name=Muntz /> When he commissioned Leonardo with ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and later [[Domenico Puligo]] with a painting of [[Saint Francis]], Francesco was a patron like his peers. ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was painted beginning in 1503, following Andrea's birth and when the family was celebrating owning its own home.<ref name=Zoellner /> Lisa was 24 years old when Leonardo started her portrait.

The painting fulfilled 15th and early-16th century requirements for portraying a woman of virtue and also succeeded in presenting Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Lisa is painted as a faithful wife, not with a wedding ring, but through gesture<U+2014>her right hand rests over her left hand. Her dark garments and black veil do not depict mourning for her first daughter as some scholars have proposed, but rather, high fashion, in a style she and her contemporaries drew from Spanish influence. Equal in size to commissions paid for by wealthier art patrons of the time, the portrait is strikingly large and shows some social aspiration on the part of Francesco and Lisa.<ref name=Zoellner />
