'''Asian arowana''' refers to several varieties of [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[fish]] in the genus ''[[Scleropages]]''. Some sources differentiate these varieties into multiple [[species]],<ref name="Pouyad">Pouyaud ''et al.'', 2003</ref><ref>ITIS, 2006.</ref> while others consider the different strains to belong to a single species, ''Scleropages formosus''.<ref>Kottelat and Widjanarti, 2005.</ref> They have several other common names, including '''Asian bonytongue''', '''dragon fish''', and a number of names specific to different varieties.

Native to [[Southeast Asia]], Asian arowanas inhabit [[blackwater river]]s, slow-moving waters flowing through forested swamps and [[wetland]]s. Adults feed on other fish, while juveniles feed on [[insect]]s.<ref>Fishbase, 2006.</ref> 

These popular [[aquarium]] fish have special [[culture|cultural]] significance in areas influenced by [[Chinese culture]].  The name ''dragon fish'' stems from their resemblance to the [[Chinese dragon]]. This popularity has had both positive and negative effects on their status as [[endangered species]].

==Evolution and taxonomy==
Like all members of [[Osteoglossidae]], Asian arowanas are highly adapted to [[fresh water]] and are incapable of surviving in the ocean. Therefore, their spread throughout the islands of southeast Asia suggests they diverged from other osteoglossids before the [[plate tectonics|continental breakup]] was complete. Genetic studies have confirmed this hypothesis, showing that their ancestor of the Asian arowanas diverged from the ancestor of the Australian arowanas, ''[[Scleropages jardinii|S. jardinii]]'' and ''[[Scleropages leichardti|S. leichardti]]'', about 140&nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Early Cretaceous]] period. This divergence took place in the eastern margin of [[Gondwanaland]], with the ancestors of Asian arowanas carried on the [[Indian subcontinent]] or smaller landmasses into Asia. The [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarity of all ''Scleropages'' species shows that little [[evolution]]ary change has taken place recently for these ancient fish.<ref>Kumazawa, 2000; Kumazawa ''et al.'', 2003.</ref>

The first description of these species was published between 1839 and 1844 (1844 is the date commonly cited) by German [[natural history|naturalists]] [[Salomon M<U+00FC>ller]] and [[Hermann Schlegel]], under the name ''[[Osteoglossum]] formosum'', although later this species was placed in ''Scleropages'' with the name ''S. formosus''.<ref>Catalog of Fishes, 2006.</ref> 

[[Image:Red Arowana034.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Super red arowana in a [[aquarium|public aquarium]].]]
Several distinct, naturally occurring colour varieties are recognised, each found in a specific geographic region. They include the following:

* The '''green''' is the most common variety, found in [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Malaysia]].
* The '''silver Asian''' (not to be confused with the [[silver arowana]], ''Osteoglossum bicirrhosum'') is considered part of the green variety by some. It has two subvarieties, the "grey tail silver" or "Pinoh arowana," and the "yellow tail silver," each found in a different part of the island of [[Borneo]] in [[Indonesia]].
* The '''red-tailed golden''' is found in northern [[Sumatra]], Indonesia.
* The '''gold crossback''', '''blue Malayan''', or '''Bukit Merah blue''' is native to the state of [[Pahang]] and [[Bukit Merah, Perak|Bukit Merah]] area in [[Perak]], Malaysia.
* The '''red''', '''super red''', '''blood red''', or '''chili red''' is known only from the upper part of the [[Kapuas River]] in western Borneo, Indonesia.

In 2003, a study<ref name="Pouyad"/> was published which proposed breaking ''S. formosus'' into four separate species. This classification was based on both [[Anatomy|morphology]] and [[genetics]], and includes the following species:

* ''Scleropages formosus'' was redescribed to include the strain known as the '''green arowana'''. The gold '''crossback''', which was not part of the study, was included in this species by default.
* ''Scleropages macrocephalus'' described the '''silver Asian arowana'''.
* ''Scleropages aureus'' described the '''red-tailed golden arowana'''.
* ''Scleropages legendrei'' described the '''super red arowana'''.

Other researchers dispute this reclassification, arguing that the published data are insufficient to justify recognizing more than one Southeast Asian species of ''Scleropages''.<ref>''e.g.'' Kottelat and Widjanarti, 2005.</ref>

==Description==
[[Image:Asian arowana scales.JPG|right|thumb|350px|Asian arowana scales are large (most over 2 [[centimetre|cm]] in length) and have a delicate net pattern.]]Asian arowanas grow up to 90&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (35&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) [[fish measurement|total length]].<ref>FishBase, 2006.</ref> Like all ''Scleropages'', Asian arowanas have long bodies; large, elongate [[pectoral fin]]s; [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s located far back on the body; and a much larger [[caudal fin]] than that of their [[South America]]n relative, the [[silver arowana]], ''Osteoglossum bicirrhosum''. The mouth is oblique with a very wide gape. The prominent lower jaw has two [[Barbel (anatomy)|barbel]]s at its tip. The [[gill raker]]s are stout. Asian arowanas bear teeth on many bones of the mouth, including the jaws, vomer, palatines, pterygoids, parasphenoid, and tongue.<ref>Ismail, 1989; Pouyaud ''et al.'', 2003; West & NSK (Arowana Club.com), 2003.</ref>

Asian arowana scales are large, [[cycloid scale|cycloid]], and, in some varieties, metallic coloured, with a distinctive [[mosaic]] pattern of raised ribs.<ref>Ismail, 1989</ref><ref name="Pouyad"/> The lateral scales are arranged in horizontal rows numbered from the most ventral (first level) to the most dorsal (fifth level), with dorsal scales designated the sixth level.<ref>West & NSK (Arowana Club.com), 2003.</ref>

Asian arowanas are distinguished from Australian congenerics ''[[Gulf saratoga|S. jardinii]]'' and ''[[saratoga (fish)|S. leichardti]]'' by having fewer (21-26) [[lateral line]] scales (versus 32-36 for the Australian species), longer pectoral and pelvic fins, and a longer anterior snout.<ref name="Pouyad"/>

'''Green arowanas''' are dark green on the back, silvery or golden green on its sides, and silvery or whitish on its ventral surface, with dark greenish or bluish patches visible through the lateral scales. In mature fish, the top of the eye and the head behind the eye are bright emerald.<ref name="Pouyad"/>

Both grey-tailed and yellow-tailed '''silver Asian arowanas''' are dark grey on the back and silver on the sides, with dark ring patches on the lateral scales and a silvery or whitish belly.  In yellow-tailed specimens, the fin membranes are yellowish with dark grey rays. In grey-tailed specimens, the fins are uniform dark grey.<ref name="Pouyad"/>

[[Image:Gold Arowana035.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Red-tailed golden arowana. Although the scales are golden, the anal and caudal fins are reddish-brown.]]Mature '''red-tailed golden arowanas''' have brilliant metallic gold lateral scales, [[Operculum (fish)|gill covers]], bellies, and pectoral and pelvic fin membranes, although the back is dark. In juveniles the areas destined to develop golden colour start out metallic silver. The anal fin and the bottom portion of the caudal fin are light brown to dark red.<ref name="Pouyad"/>

Mature '''gold crossback arowanas''' are distinguished from the red-tailed golden arowanas by having metallic gold crossing the back completely. This variety also lacks the reddish fins of the red-tailed golden.<ref>''Unoaquatic Arowana Group'', 1999.</ref>

In mature '''super red arowanas''', the gill covers, lateral scales, and fin membranes of these fishes are metallic red, with the exact hue varying from gold-tinged to deep red. The back is dark brown. In juveniles, the darker the dorsal colouration, the deeper the red will be on maturity.<ref name="Pouyad"/>

==Behaviour==
Asian arowanas are paternal [[mouthbrooder]]s. They are slow to reach sexual maturity and difficult to breed in captivity, with successful [[spawning]]s typically taking place in large outdoor ponds rather than in [[aquarium|aquaria]].<ref>''Fishindex.com'', 2004.</ref> 

Two breeders reported success using a garden pond measuring 18&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]] by 18&nbsp;feet by 3.5&nbsp;feet deep (5.5&nbsp;[[metre]] by 5.5&nbsp;metre by 1.1&nbsp;metre deep), with [[pH]] maintained between 6.5 and 7.0. The fish were over five years old. The successful harvest took place after the third spawning; in the first two spawnings, the male swallowed the eggs, possibly due to improper water quality.<ref>''Shin Min Daily News'', 2005.</ref>

==Relationship with humans==
===Cultural beliefs===
Asian arowanas are considered "lucky" by many people, particularly those from [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]]. This reputation derives from the species' resemblance to the [[Chinese dragon]], considered an auspicious [[symbol]].<ref>''Dragonfish Industry'', 1997.</ref> The large metallic scales and double barbels are features shared by the Chinese dragon, and the large pectoral fins are said to make the fish resemble "a dragon in full flight."<ref>West & NSK (Arowana Club.com), 2003.</ref> 

In addition, positive [[Feng Shui]] associations with water and the colours red and gold make these fishes popular for aquariums. One belief is that while water is a place where [[qi|chi]] gathers, it is naturally a source of [[yin and yang|yin]] energy and must contain an "auspicious" fish such as an arowana in order to have balancing yang energy.<ref>''Unoaquatic Arowana Group'', 1999.</ref> Another is that a fish can preserve its owner from death by dying itself.<ref>''Hindustan Times'', 2005.</ref>

===Conservation===
The Asian arowanas are listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] by the 2006 [[IUCN Red List]], with the most recent evaluation taking place in 1996.<ref name="Kottelat"/> International trade in these fishes is controlled under the [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna]] (CITES), under which it was placed on Appendix I, the most restrictive category, in [[1975]].<ref>''Fishindex.com'', 2004; ''CITES'', 2005.</ref> ''S. formosus'' is one of only eight fish species listed on Appendix I.<ref>Dawes, 2001, p. 20.</ref> There are a number of registered CITES breeders in Asia and the specimens they produce can be imported into several nations. Other nations restrict or prohibit possession of Asian arowanas; for example, the [[United States]] has listed this species under the [[Endangered Species Act]], and therefore it cannot be possessed in that country without a permit.<ref>United States Fish and Wildlife Service Threatened and Endangered Species System (TESS).</ref>

Declining [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] is a major threat. For example, Asian arowanas are now uncommon in the [[Malay Peninsula]], where they were once widely distributed, due to environmental destruction.<ref>Ismail, 1989, p. 27.</ref> Inclusion in the IUCN Red List was originally based not on biological reasons but on practical ones: though widely distributed throughout southeast Asia, they have been harvested heavily by aquarium collectors. However, habitat loss is likely a greater threat than aquarium collecting.<ref>Ismail, 1989, p. 434.</ref>

There is no recent evaluation of [[conservation status]] by IUCN.<ref name="Kottelat"/> Additionally, considering the current confusion as to number of species as well as the wide distribution, conservation status needs to be reconsidered. All strains are probably endangered, but some more critically than others.<ref name="Pouyad"/>

The Asian arowana's high value as [[aquarium]] fish has impacted its [[conservation ethic|conservation]]. Its popularity has soared since the late 1970s, and hobbyists may pay thousands of [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] for one of these animals.<ref>Ismail, 1989, p. 434</ref><ref name="Lee">Lee, n.d.</ref>

Beginning in [[1989]], CITES began allowing Asian arowanas to be traded, provided certain criteria were met, most notably that they were bred in captivity on a [[fish farming|fish farm]] for at least two generations.<ref name="Dawes22">Dawes, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The first of these farms was in [[Indonesia]].<ref name="Lee"/> Later, the [[government of Singapore|Singapore government]]'s Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (then called the Primary Production Department) and a local fish exporter collaborated in a [[captive breeding]] program. Asian arowanas legally certified by CITES for trade became available from this program in 1994.<ref name="Dawes22"/>

Captive-bred arowanas that are legal for trade under CITES are documented in two ways. First, fish farms provide each buyer with a certificate of authenticity and a birth certificate. Second, each specimen receives an [[Microchip implant (animal)|implanted microchip]], called a ''Passive Integrated Transponder'' (PIT), which identifies individual animals.<ref name="Lee"/>
 
[[Genetic fingerprinting]] has been used to assess the [[genetic diversity]] of a captive population at a [[Singapore]] fish farm in order to improve the management of this species.<ref>Fernando ''et al.'', 1997.</ref> DNA markers that distinguish among different strains and between sexes have been identified, allowing aquaculturists to identify these characteristics in immature animals.<ref>Yue ''et al.'', 2003.</ref>

===Care in captivity===
Because they can grow up to 90&nbsp;centimetres (35&nbsp;inches) long, Asian arowanas require a large aquarium. They are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and may be kept with other ''Scleropages'' only in a very large aquarium, provided all fish are of similar size. Like [[arowana|other arowana]]s, they need a tight-fitting cover to prevent jumping.<ref name="Dawes293">Dawes, 2001, pp. 293-294.</ref> The water should be well-filtred, [[soft water|soft]], and slightly [[pH|acidic]], and maintained at a temperature between 24-30<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Celsius|C]] (75-86<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|F]]).<ref name="Dawes293"/>

Asian arowanas are [[carnivore|carnivorous]] and should be fed a high-quality diet of meaty food, such as [[shrimp]] and [[cricket (insect)| cricket]]s. They are surface feeders and prefer to take food in the upper parts of the water column. Aquarists recommend live foods and meaty prepared foods. Examples of appropriate live foods include [[mealworm]]s, [[cricket (insect)| cricket]]s, [[shrimp]]s, [[feeder fish]], small [[frog]]s, and [[earthworm]]s. Prepared foods include prawns (shrimp), lean pork, frozen fish food, and pelleted food.<ref>''Anglo Aquarium'' (n.d.); ''Shin Min Daily News'', 2005; ''Fishindex.com'', 2004.</ref>
