The '''Choiseul Pigeon''' or '''Solomons Crested Pigeon''' (''Microgoura meeki'') is an [[extinction|extinct]] species of [[bird]] in the pigeon and dove family [[Columbidae]]. It was [[Endemism|endemic]] to the island of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], although there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The Choiseul Pigeon was [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] within the genus '''''Microgoura ''''' and had no known subspecies. Its closest living relative is believed to be the [[Thick-billed Ground Pigeon]], and some authors have suggested that the Choiseul Pigeon may be a link between that species and the [[crowned pigeon]]s.  The adult pigeon was largely blue-grey, with a buffy orange belly and a distinctive slaty-blue crest. It is unknown how this crest was held by the bird in life. The bird's head sported a blue frontal shield surrounded by black feathers and a bicoloured beak. The wings were brown and the short tail was a blackish purple. It was described as having a beautiful rising and falling whistling call.

As the bird became extinct before significant field observations could be made, not much is known about its behaviour. It is believed to have been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul Pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked [[mangrove]]s. It was only recorded by [[Albert Stewart Meek]], who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It is believed to have been rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of [[feral cat]]s, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a [[carnivore|carnivorous]] mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul Pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Trugon.jpg|thumb|left|The related Thick-billed Ground Pigeon]]
The Choiseul Pigeon was described by Lord [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] in 1904 on the basis of six skins<U+2014>three male and three female<U+2014>and an egg collected by [[Albert Stewart Meek]] earlier that year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|p=241}}</ref><ref name="NovZoo"/> It was placed in the [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus ''Microgoura'', whose name comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''mikros'' "small", and ''goura'', a [[New Guinea]]n aboriginal name for the similarly-crested [[crowned pigeon]]s of the genus ''Goura''.<ref name="Donald228">{{Harvnb|Donald|2010|p=228}}</ref><ref name="Jobling176">{{Harvnb|Jobling|2010|p=176}}</ref> Rothschild named the species after Meek, giving the bird the specific name ''meeki''.<ref name="Rothschild"/> Though its relationships are unclear, the Choiseul Pigeon is believed to have been closest to the [[Thick-billed Ground Pigeon]] from [[Indonesia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], which has similar plumage.<ref name="Gibbs 417">{{Harvnb|Gibbs|2001|p=417}}</ref> It has been suggested that the Choiseul Pigeon was a link between the Thick-billed Ground Pigeon and the crowned pigeons; however, other sources argue that it may not have been closely related to the crowned pigeons as its crest was quite different.<ref name="Baptista63">{{Harvnb|Baptista|1997|p=63}}</ref><ref name="Gibbs 418"/> It has no known subspecies.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/>

Today, five skins and a partial skeleton are kept in the [[American Museum of Natural History]], while a single skin and the egg are kept at the [[Natural History Museum at Tring]].<ref name="Tennent243">{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|p=243}}</ref><ref name="Hume154">{{Harvnb|Hume|2012|p=154}}</ref> The Choiseul Pigeon is also known as the Solomon Crowned Pigeon, Solomon Islands Pigeon, Solomons Crested Pigeon, Solomon Islands Crested Pigeon, Choiseul Crested Pigeon, Crested Choiseul Pigeon, Meek's Pigeon, Meek's Ground Pigeon, and Dwarf Goura.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|p=242}}</ref> The indigenous peoples of Choiseul called the species either "kumku-peka" or "kukuru-ni-lua," which translates literally as "pigeon-belong-ground."<ref name="Gibbs 418">{{Harvnb|Gibbs|2001|p=418}}</ref><ref name="Hume154"/>

==Description==
[[File:Microgoura meeki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration showing alternate crest arrangement]]
The Choiseul Pigeon was about {{convert|31|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="Rothschild">{{harvnb|Rothschild|1904|pp=77<U+2013>78}}</ref> The wing of the male was 195<U+2013>197&nbsp;mm (7.6<U+2013>7.7&nbsp;in), the tail 100<U+2013>105&nbsp;mm (4<U+2013>4.1&nbsp;in), the [[culmen (bird)|culmen]] 34&nbsp;mm (1.3&nbsp;in), and the [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] was 60&nbsp;mm (2.3&nbsp;in). The wing of the female was 180<U+2013>190&nbsp;mm (7<U+2013>7.4&nbsp;in), the tail 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;in), the culmen 33&nbsp;mm (1.3&nbsp;in), and the tarsus was 60&nbsp;mm (2.3&nbsp;in).<ref name="Fuller">{{Harvnb|Fuller|2001|pages=185<U+2013>188}}</ref> Adult Choiseul Pigeons of both sexes were blue-grey overall with a buffy orange belly.<ref name="Gibbs 418"/> The pigeon had a distinctive long, rounded crest that had a hairy texture. This crest, like the crown, was slaty-blue and emerged from the bird's hindcrown.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> Though many artists have speculated, it is unknown how the pigeon held its crest in life as Meek's notes did not cover this subject. [[John Gerrard Keulemans]](who produced the illustration accompanying Rothschild's original description), depicted the crest as being flat based on Meek's specimens; other artists have presented it as spread and scraggly like that of the crowned pigeons.<ref name="Tennent251">{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|p=251}}</ref> It has been suggested that the crests of the museum specimens were flattened during preparation.<ref name="Fuller"/>

On the bird's forehead was a naked and pale chalky-blue frontal shield.<ref name="Gibbs 418"/> This was surrounded by short, velvety black feathers that extended from the base of the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash.<ref name="Baptista187">{{Harvnb|Baptista|1997|p=187}}</ref> The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast.<ref name="Rothschild"/> The abdomen and [[Covert feather#Tail coverts|undertail-coverts]] were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips.<ref name="Rothschild"/> The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen.<ref name="NovZoo">{{harvnb|Hartert|1905|p=247}}</ref><ref name="Gibbs 419"/> The bill was bicoloured; the upper [[mandible]] was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] was a dark brown.<ref name="NovZoo"/>

The bird's voice was never recorded; however, after it became extinct, the indigenous peoples described it as possessing a "beautiful rising and falling whistling call given from the roost site every evening."<ref name="Gibbs 418"/> Others described the call as a low "c-r-r-ooo," "cr-ooo," or "cr-o-o-o."<ref name="Gibbs 418"/>

==Behaviour and ecology==
It is likely that the Choiseul Pigeon was a largely terrestrial species, feeding and nesting near the forest floor.<ref name="Baptista187"/> The indigenous people of the town of Vundutura said that the pigeon would roost in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs close to the ground.<ref name="Tennent251" /> They claimed that the species was very tame, allowing local hunters to approach it and pick it up off of its perch by hand.<ref name="Tennent251" /> They reported that the species had [[Gastrolith|stones]] in its [[gizzard]].<ref name="Hume156"/> It laid a single dark, cream-coloured egg in an unlined depression on the ground.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> The egg was about {{convert|43|mm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|31.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} in size, which is considered small in proportion to the bird.<ref name="Rothschild"/><ref name="Tennent243" />

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:GuadalcanalRiver.jpg|thumb|right||alt=A river running through lowland forest in the Solomon Islands|Lowland forest in the Solomon Islands]]
The Choiseul Pigeon was [[Bird migration|non-migratory]] and is thought to have lived on the forest floor in lowland forests, including coastal swampy areas that lacked [[mangrove]]s.<ref name="BirdLife"/><ref name="Hume155"/> The Choiseul Pigeon is usually considered to have been [[endemic]] to the island of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] in the [[Solomon Islands]] off the coast of New Guinea, where the only specimens were collected.<ref name="Baptista187"/> The specimens Meek acquired were likely collected near [[Choiseul Bay]] in the northern part of the island.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> The last reports of the species from the indigenous population came from the Kolombangara River.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> It also reportedly lived on the neighboring islands of [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]] and [[Malaita]], and it is suspected that it may once have lived on [[Bougainville Island]].<ref name="Gibbs 419">{{Harvnb|Gibbs|2001|p=419}}</ref> However, these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal.<ref name="Tennent250">{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|p=250}}</ref> It would be considered very unusual if the Choiseul Pigeon were truly endemic to Choiseul as the island hosts no other endemic species, and the pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on the island.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/>

In January 1904 six specimens and an egg were collected by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul.<ref name="Hume154"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|pp=241<U+2013>243}}</ref> Several local boys told Meek that the pigeon was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita.<ref name="Baptista187"/> Though Meek did not travel to these islands, he did search for the Choiseul Pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but did not find any evidence of its presence.<ref name="Baptista187"/> No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists.<ref name="Tennent250" />

The Choiseul Pigeon was not searched for again until briefly in 1927 and again in October 1929, when five veteran collectors belonging to the [[Whitney South Seas Expedition]] dedicated three months to searching for the pigeon in multiple locations across Choiseul without success.<ref name="Haffer82">{{Harvnb|Haffer|2008|p=82}}</ref> The indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that the pigeon was extinct in 1929.<ref name="Haffer82"/> The last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in the early 1940s near Sasamungga by the Kolombangara River, although this sighting was never confirmed.<ref name="Hume155">{{Harvnb|Hume|2012|p=155}}</ref> Searches of the small, cat-free islands of [[Rob Roy Island]] and [[Vaghena Island|Wagina]] off Choiseul's southeast coast and Choiseul's forested coastal swampland in the 1960s by British ornithologist [[Shane A. Parker]] did not discover any signs of the pigeon.<ref name="Hume154"/> American scientist [[Jared Diamond]] searched for the bird in 1974 without success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|p=247}}</ref>

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:Flag of Choiseul.png|thumb|Choiseul Pigeon on the flag of the Choiseul Province]]
This pigeon was a source of food for the local people, who would locate its roosting sites either due to the bird calling or by the droppings that had accumulated below its perches.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> It was well-remembered by the indigenous peoples, and stories of the delicious ground-dwelling pigeon were passed down by local elders after its extinction.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> One indigenous person implied that the gizzard stones of the pigeon may have had value locally.<ref name="Hume156">{{Harvnb|Hume|2012|p=156}}</ref> After the bird's extinction, the indigenous people have occasionally confused the Choiseul Pigeon with the arboreal [[Crested Cuckoo-Dove]] in modern folklore, and several claims of the pigeon's continued existence turned out to be based on the cuckoo-dove.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|p=246}}</ref> After its discovery, several Western [[bird collections]] highly desired its skins; the Whitney South Seas Expedition spent three months at high expense on Choiseul with the primary objective being the acquisition of the Choiseul Pigeon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tennent|2009|pp=245<U+2013>248}}</ref> In 2012 the Choiseul Pigeon was commemorated on a stamp from [[Mozambique]] along with several other extinct birds.<ref name="Stamps">{{cite web | last =Scharning | first =Kjell | title =Stamps showing Choiseul Pigeon ''Microgoura meeki <U+2020>'' | work =Theme Birds on Stamps | url =http://www.birdtheme.org/mainlyimages/index.php?spec=3796 | accessdate = 19 April 2013}}</ref> The Choiseul Pigeon is depicted on the flag of the Choiseul Province.<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/sb-ch.html Choiseul Province (Solomon Islands)]</ref>

===Extinction===
The indigenous population believed that the pigeon became extinct due to the introduction of feral cats and, to a lesser extent, feral dogs.<ref name="Hume155"/> As Choiseul has no indigenous [[carnivore|carnivorous]] mammals, the ground-dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats.<ref name="Donald228"/> If the pigeon existed on islands that feral cats had never reached, it is believed that the clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction.<ref name="Gibbs 419"/> As there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the [[IUCN]] has declared it [[extinct]].<ref name="BirdLife">{{cite web| title =Species factsheet: ''Microgoura meeki''| publisher =BirdLife International | year =2013 | url = http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2625| accessdate = 19 April 2013 }}</ref> As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, it is likely that the Choiseul Pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904.<ref name="Tennent251" />
