The '''Dnieper River''' (also known as: ''Dnepr'', ''Dniapro'', or ''Dnipro'') is a [[river]] which flows from [[Russia]], through [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], ending its flow in the [[Black Sea]]. Its total length is 2,285 [[kilometer|km]], of which 485 km lie within Russia, 595 km within Belarus, and 1,095 km within Ukraine. The Dnieper's Basin covers 504,000 [[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]], of which 289,000 km<U+00B2> are within the territory of Ukraine.<ref name="EoU">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\D\N\DnieperRiver.htm |title=Dnieper River |accessdate= |accessmonthday=January 19 |accessyear=2007 |author= |last=[[Volodymyr Kubiyovych|Kubiyovych]] |first=Volodymyr |authorlink= |coauthors=Ivan Teslia |work=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |language=English }}</ref>

The Dnieper finds its source in the [[Valdai Hills]] of central Russia, at an elevation of 220 [[Metre|m]], among turf swamps.<ref name="EoU">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\D\N\DnieperRiver.htm |title=Dnieper River |accessdate= |accessmonthday=January 19 |accessyear=2007 |author= |last=[[Volodymyr Kubiyovych|Kubiyovych]] |first=Volodymyr |authorlink= |coauthors=Ivan Teslia |work=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |language=English }}</ref> It later runs south eventually flowing into the [[Black Sea]]. 115 kilometres of its length serve as a natural border between Belarus and Ukraine. Approximately the last 800 kilometres of the river is a chain of nearly consecutive reservoirs.

The Dnieper is connected with the [[Western Bug]] by the [[Dnieper-Bug Canal]]. Its estuary, or [[Liman (landform)|liman]], used to be defended by the strong fortress of [[Ochakiv]].

===Reservoirs===

The Dnieper's last 800 kilometres before it flows into the Black Sea is an almost consecutive chain of reservoirs, all of them being located in Ukraine. They were built along with the river's hydroelectric stations during the [[Soviet Union]], and are used to generate hydroelectric power, providing around ten percent of Ukraine's electricity. The reservoirs include: [[Kiev Reservoir|Kiev]] (922 km<U+00B2>), [[Kaniv Reservoir|Kaniv]] (675 km<U+00B2>), [[Kremenchuk Reservoir|Kremenchuk]] (2,250 km<U+00B2>), [[Dniprodzerzhynsk Reservoir|Dniprodzerzhynsk]] (567 km<U+00B2>), [[Dnieper Reservoir|Dnieper ]] (420 km<U+00B2>), and [[Kakhovka Reservoir|Kakhovka]] (2,155 km<U+00B2>).  The dams forming these are used to generate hydroelectric power, 

===Cities and towns on the Dnieper===

Cities and towns located on the Dnieper are listed from the river's source (in Russia) to its mouth (in Ukraine):

[[Arheimar]], a capital of the [[Goths]], was located on the Dnieper, according to the [[Hervarar saga]].

==Navigation==

The Dnieper river is important for the [[Transport in Ukraine|transport]] and [[economy of Ukraine]]: the river's reservoirs have all been equipped with large ship locks, allowing vessels of up to 270<U+00D7>18 metres to access even the port of [[Kiev]] and thus creating a perfect transport corridor. The river is used by passenger vessels too: inland cruises on the rivers [[Danube]] and Dnieper have been a growing market in recent decades. 

Upstream from Kiev, the Dnieper receives the water of the [[Pripyat river]]. This navigable river connects to the Dnieper-Bug canal, the link with the [[Western Bug]] river. Historically, a connection with the Western European waterways was possible, but a [[weir]] without a ship lock near the town of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] has interrupted this interesting international waterway. The political relation between Western Europe and Belarus does not allow for much hope of reopening of this direct inland shipping link any time soon.<ref>[http://www.noordersoft.com/indexen.html NoorderSoft Waterways Database]</ref>

==Economic significance==
===Hydroelectric power===

The river is famous for its dams, which were often touted as achievements of Soviet Industry. The most famous one was the [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] or (DnieproGES) near [[Zaporizhia]], which was built in 1927-1932 with an output of 558 MW. The [[World War II|Second World War]] completely destroyed the station and in 1948 it was rebuilt and its capacity output increased to 750 MW. 

The [[Kremenchuk]] Hydroelectric Station was the second one built in 1954<U+2013>60, the Kiev Hydroelectric Station followed 1960<U+2013>64, the [[Dniprodzerzhynsk]] Hydroelectric Station in 1956<U+2013>64, and the [[Kaniv]] Hydroelectric Station 1963<U+2013>75 completed the Cascade of Dams.

==Name etymology==

[[Image:Ukraine Dnepr bei Cherson.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Dnieper River in [[Kherson]], [[Ukraine]].]]

The name ''Dnieper'' is derived from [[Sarmatian]] (Iranian) ''D<U+0101>nu apara'' "the river to the rear".<ref>Mallory, J.P. and Victor H. Mair.  ''The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West''.  London: Thames and Hudson, 2000. p. 106</ref>  (By contrast, the [[Dniester]] derives from "the river to the front".)

In all three countries it has essentially the same name, albeit pronounced differently, {{lang-ru|<U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440>, ''Dnepr''}}; {{lang-be|<U+0414><U+043D><U+044F><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E>, ''Dniapro''}}; {{lang-uk|<U+0414><U+043D><U+0456><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E>, ''Dnipro''}}. The river is mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] in the [[fifth century BC]] as ''Borysthenes''  (<U+0392><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03B8><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>), as well as by [[Strabo]] ; the late [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authors called it <U+0394><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C0><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C2> - ''Danapris'' and ''Danaper'' respectively, <U+0394><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B1> in [[Old Persian]] means river. Its [[Old East Slavic language|Old Slavic]] name used at times of [[Kievan Rus']] was ''Slavutich'' "the Slavic (river)"; the [[Huns]]  called it ''Var'', and Bulgars - ''Buri-Chai''.<br><br>

===In Popular Culture===

* [[Folk Metal]] band [[Turisas]] have a song called The Dnieper Rapids on their lastest album [[The Varangian Way]]
