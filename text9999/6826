==Transport in Ireland==
{{main|Transport in Ireland}}
Ireland's national flag carrier is Aer Lingus, which services Europe, North America and North Africa, but the vast majority of flights originating from continental Europe come from another Irish company, [[Ryanair]], the biggest low cost airline in the world. These airlines, along with others, fly into all three of Ireland's international airports, [[Shannon Airport]], [[Dublin Airport]] and [[Cork Airport]]. Dublin Airport is by far the busiest, accounting for over 80% of passenger entering and leaving Ireland in 2011.<ref name="Dublin Airport Authority Financial Report">{{cite web | url=http://www.daa.ie/daa_ar_2011/ | title=Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 | publisher=Dublin Airport Authority | accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> Along with these airports there are several other regional airports in the country including [[Knock Airport]] and [[Kerry Airport]], which both operate international flights to Europe.<br />
For travellers from mainland Europe and the UK, another way to enter the country is by sea, with connections by ferry to [[Roscoff]] and [[Cherbourg]] in France and [[Liverpool]] and [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] in England, [[Fishguard]] and [[Holyhead]] in Wales and [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] on the [[Isle of Man]]. These routes are operated by [[Irish Ferries]], [[Stena Line]], [[Celtic Link Ferries]] and [[P&O Ferries]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.poferries.com/ | title=P&O Ferries Official Website | publisher=P&O Ferries | accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stenaline.ie/ferry/ | title=Stena Line Official Website | publisher=Stena Line | accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.irishferries.com/ie/index-uk-ie.asp | title=Irish Ferries Official Website | publisher=Irish Ferries | accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref><br />
[[Motorways in the Republic of Ireland|Motorways]] link Dublin with all the major cities in the country and there are plans to extend the motorway system in the future. In recent years the quality of Irish roads has improved dramatically with the advent of the [[Celtic Tiger]] and significant [[European Union]] funding, although outside the main routes, roads can be quite unpredictable in terms of quality and upkeep, especially in rural areas such as [[County Kerry|Co. Kerry]] and [[County Donegal|Co. Donegal]].<br />
The [[Rail transport in Ireland|rail and light rail network]] in Ireland is not as extensive as it once was, but it is still possible to get from city to city using the rail system, although many rural stations have closed along these lines. At the moment there is only one [[Light rail|light rail system]] in the country, the [[Luas]] in Dublin. This system opened in 2004 and due to the number of people availing of it (27.5million in 2010) it was stated as being "Dublin's best public transport success story" by [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Minister for Transport]], [[Leo Varadkar]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jcdecaux.ie/latest-news/luas-is-dublins-best-public-transport-success-story/ | title=Luas is Dublin's best public transport success story | publisher=JC Decaux | accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>

==Cities==

===Dublin===
{{Life in the Republic of Ireland}}
The Capital, and also the largest city in the [[Republic of Ireland]] is [[Dublin]]. Due to its proximity to the USA, it was the most important city in Ireland during the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] and subsequent British Invasions until after 1922 when the [[Irish Free State]] was formed. As the British held a presence here for over 500 years, most of the historic buildings from the 1500s on were built by them. As [[Dublin Airport]] is located just outside the city, most international visitors to Ireland begin their stay here. Among the main attractions in Dublin are [[Dublin Castle]], the seat of British rule in Ireland until 1922, [[Phoenix Park]], one of the largest inner city parks in the world,<ref name="Trivago - Phoenix Park">{{cite web | url=http://www.trivago.ie/dublin-42454/park--botanical-gardens/phoenix-park-81081/review-o2360# | title=Largest Inner City Park in Europe | publisher=Trivago | accessdate=1 January 2006}}</ref> [[General Post Office (Dublin)|The General Post Office]], one of Ireland's most famous buildings due to the [[1916 Easter rising]], [[Kilmainham Gaol]], a former prison turned museum that held and executed the rebels of the 1916 Rising and [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], where the [[Book of Kells]] and the [[Book of Durrow]] are held.<ref name="Trinity College Book Collection ">{{cite web | url=http://www.tcd.ie/Library/bookofkells/ | title=The Old Library and the Book of Kells Exhibition | publisher=Trinity College Dublin | accessdate=1 January 2006}}</ref> In 2010, Dublin was awarded the title of [[UNESCO City of Literature]], as many famous writers such as [[James Joyce]] and [[Samuel Beckett]] are from the city.<ref name="Dublin - City of Literature">{{cite web | url=http://www.visitdublin.com/see_and_do/literary_dublin | title=City of Literature | publisher=Visit Dublin | accessdate=1 January 2006}}</ref>

*[[Saint Stephen's Green]], a city centre public park.

===Cork===
Situated on the southern coast of Ireland, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] is the second biggest city in the country. Due to a population explosion in the 1800s, many of its most famous buildings are from this era. In this period two cathedrals were built, [[Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne]] and [[Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral]]. Another historic attraction from this time is Cork City Gaol which opened in 1824, it is now a visitor centre for people to feel what it was like to live in the city, and imprisoned in the jail, 200 years ago.<ref name="A history of Cork City Gaol">{{cite web | url=http://www.corkcitygaol.com/history.html | title=Cork City Gaol <U+2248> History | publisher=Cork Gaol | accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> Cork's most famous building and the symbol of the city, [[Church of St Anne (Shandon)|The Church of St. Anne]], is known for its clock tower dubbed "The Four Faced Liar" on account of all four of the clocks showing slightly different times.

===Limerick===
Situated on the mouth of the [[River Shannon]], [[Limerick]] has been an important gateway city for over 800 years. Due to the city's location on the midpoint of the [[Atlantic Corridor]], it has become something of a base city for tourists travelling along the west coast of Ireland, although the city has many attractions in its own right. [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] in the medieval quarter of the city is arguably the best known attraction in the city, dating back to 922AD. The old city walls of Limerick surround a small bit of the site, although most of the walls have collapsed.<ref name="Limerick City Walls">{{cite web | url=http://www.aegisarchaeology.com/limerick-city-walls | title=Limerick City Walls Conservation Plan | publisher=aegisarchaeology.com | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> The [[Hunt Museum]] in the city hosts one of the worlds greatest private collections in the world, winning the Museum of the year award many times over the years.<ref name="Rte Report - Hunt Museum ">{{cite web | url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2003/1125/huntmuseum.html | title=Limerick's Hunt Museum wins award | publisher=RT<U+00C9> | date=25 November 2003 | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> The museum has a wide collection of both ancient and medieval pieces of art and sculpture, originating from varied locations and civilisations around the world including [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Olmec|Olmec Civilisation]].

Yeats]] and [[Henry Moore]].<ref name="Collection of the Hunt Museum">{{cite web | url=http://www.huntmuseum.com/collection.aspx | title=Hunt Museum Collection | publisher=Hunt Museum | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>

'''Other Attractions'''
*[[Foynes|Foynes village and Museum]], a small village outside Limerick City that was the last port of call for [[Seaplanes]] heading towards [[Americas|The Americas]]. This stretch of the [[River Shannon]] became one of the biggest civilian airports in Europe during [[World War II]], and was where the drink [[Irish Coffee]] was first served.<ref name="Seaplane museum in Foynes">{{cite web | url=http://www.flyingboatmuseum.com/museum.html | title=Foynes Flying Boat Museum | publisher=Foynes Flying Boat Museum | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="Irish Coffee - Foynes">{{cite web | url=http://www.flyingboatmuseum.com/irishcoffee.html | title=Irish Coffee at Foynes | publisher=Foynes Flying Boat Museum | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>
*[[St John's Cathedral (Limerick)|St John's Cathedral]], one of two cathedrals in the city, this one has been in continuous use since 1861 and its spire is the tallest in the country, topping out at 94m. Built in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, it is one of the few Irish buildings designed by [[Philip Charles Hardwick]].<ref name="St John's Cathedral - Limerick">{{cite web | url=http://www.limerickdioceseheritage.org/StJohns/chStJohns.htm | title=History of St John's Cathedral | publisher=Limerick Diocese | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>
*[[Adare]], a tourist destination and heritage centre, this aged village is popular due to the fact many of its buildings still bear their original thatched roofs, or crafted stone exteriors.<ref name="Adare - A History">{{cite web | url=http://www.billchawke.com/?page_id=37 | title=History of Adare | publisher=Bill Chawke | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>
*[[Lough Gur]], one of Ireland's most important [[archaeological]] sites, humans have lived at Lough Gur since about 3000BC and there are several [[megalithic]] remains there.

===Galway===
Achieving city status in 1484, [[Galway]] celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway in itself is not particularly known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene.<ref name="Galway City on Lonely Planet">{{cite web | url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/ireland/county-galway/galway-city | title=Introducing Galway City | publisher=Lonely Planet | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> This is partly because 25% of the population of Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from [[NUIG|NUI Galway]] and [[GMIT]], two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway is said to be the most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where you are likely to hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the [[Gaeltacht]] area of [[Connemara]] is only a few kilometres away.<ref name="Galway City on Lonely Planet"/> The biggest lake in the country, [[Lough Corrib]], is situated north of the city.<br /> The ferry to the [[Aran Islands]] is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of [[Rossaveal]] regularly. The Aran Islands are located in [[Galway Bay]], and the [[Irish Language]] is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a bit from the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.<ref name="Guide to the Aran Island">{{cite web | url=http://www.aranislands.ie/ | title=Aran Islands Guide | publisher=aranislands.ie | accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>

===Waterford===
Waterford is a city in the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East region]] of Ireland. It is the smallest city in the country, with a population of just over 132,000 in 2011, although it is the oldest, being founded by [[Viking]]s in 324AD. Situated in the south east, the city has one of the coldest climates in Ireland, getting on average an extra hour of sunshine each day.<ref name="Hours of Sunshine in Rosslare">{{cite web | url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1981-2010&indexid=SS&stationid=2137 | title=Rosslare Sunshine Hours | publisher=eca.nl | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> The seaside town of [[Ballybeg]] is located just south of the city and has 5&nbsp;km long beach, and is also a popular surfing spot.

==Coastlines and resorts==
As the [[Republic of Ireland]] occupies just over 80% of the [[Island of Ireland]], the country has become famous for its scenic coastline and villages and towns by the shoreline. The most widely known of these are situated in the west of Ireland, mostly in [[Munster]], but other areas of the country have their own individual resorts as well. The [[Cliffs of Moher]] are the most famous cliffs in Ireland, but the highest cliffs in Ireland and Great Britain are the [[Croaghaun]], on the Atlantic coast of [[Achill Island]] off [[County Mayo|Co. Mayo]], which rise to 688m, over three times higher than the Cliffs of Moher.<ref name="Ireland's Sea Cliffs">{{cite web | url=http://www.geograph.ie/photo/148102 | title=Croaghaun, Ireland's highest cliffs | publisher=Geograph.ie | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> The [[Slieve League]] cliffs in [[County Donegal|Co. Donegal]] are often incorrectly stated as being the highest, but at only 601m, they come in second.<br />
The south and south west of Ireland is particularly known for its seaside resorts including [[Kilkee]], [[Lahinch]], [[Quilty]], [[Spanish Point, County Clare|Spanish Point]] and [[Doonbeg]] in [[County Clare|Co. Clare]], [[Youghal]], [[Ballycotton]], [[Kinsale]] and [[Bantry]] in [[County Cork|Co. Cork]] and [[Glenbeigh]], [[Dingle]], [[Castlegregory]] and [[Ballybunion]] in [[County Kerry|Co. Kerry]]. As the west of the country faces the stormy [[Atlantic]], it has become synonymous with [[surfing]], particularly in [[County Donegal|Co. Donegal]], [[County Sligo|Co. Sligo]] and [[County Clare|Co. Clare]].<ref name="Surfing in Ireland">{{cite web | url=http://www.wannasurf.com/spot/Europe/Ireland/ | title=Surfing Locations split by Location | publisher=wannasurf.com | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> A tourism driving route, the [[Wild Atlantic Way]], extends for 2,500&nbsp;km of roadway along the West coast.

==Festivals and events==
[[File:Happy Saint Patrick's Day 2010, Dublin, Ireland, Accordion Violin.jpg|thumb|250px|Women playing violin in the Dublin St. Patrick's Day Parade]]
Ireland has many festivals, most of which take place annually. The most famous by far is the [[Saint Patrick's Day#Ireland|St Patrick's Festival]] which takes place in every county all over Ireland and celebrates [[Irish culture]] the world over. Although St. Patrick's Day festivals are held all over the world on 17 March, the festival in Ireland lasts over a week, and includes the parades on the 17 as well as the [[Skyfest]] celebrations, a fireworks display held somewhere different in Ireland every year. Part of the celebrations include [[Seachtain na Gaeilge]] (Irish Week), which aims to promote the [[Irish language]] during the two weeks proceeding the festival. The parade in [[Dublin]] is the focal point of the festival, with over 500,000 people attending it in 2012.<ref name="St Patrick's Day ">{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/dublin-hosts-st-patricks-day-party-3053700.html | title=Dublin hosts St Patrick's Day party | publisher=Irish Independent | date=17 March 2012 | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref><br />
Another festival which is known worldwide, particularly in Europe, is the [[Oxegen|Oxegen Music Festival]]. Although it wasn't held in 2012, it will be held in 2013. First held in 2004, the four-day festival has, for two consecutive years, been named as the Best European Festival in a poll which included festivals from France, [[Netherlands]], Spain, United Kingdom and other countries.<ref name="Oxegen - Best music festival ">{{cite web | url=http://www.oxegen.ie/6797/news/oxegen-named-best-festival-best-line-up-in-europe/ | title=OXEGEN NAMED BEST FESTIVAL & BEST LINE-UP IN EUROPE | publisher=Oxygen | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> Among the artists to have played at the festival include [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Afrojack]], [[Eminem]] and [[Coldplay]].<br />
For Irish people, probably the most celebrated sporting events are the annual finals of the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]. These matches, normally held around the middle of September, are normally fully sold out, with well over 80,000 people packed into [[Croke Park]], the largest stadium in Europe not used primarily for Soccer.<br />
Another festival that celebrates the Irish Culture and Diaspora all over the world is the [[Rose of Tralee (festival)|Rose of Tralee]]. This international competition, which is celebrated among the [[Irish diaspora|Irish communities all over the world]], is held annually in the town of [[Tralee]] in [[County Kerry|Co. Kerry]]. The winner is picked based on her personality and her ability to be a good role model for the festival and for Ireland during her travels around the world. Unlike other pageants, the competitors are not judged on their appearance nor their body. One of the only rules of the competition is that the potential roses have to have an Irish ancestry.<ref name="Rose of Tralee Rules">{{cite web | url=http://www.southerncaliforniaroseoftralee.com/html/entry_info.html | title=Rose of Tralee <U+2013> Entry Info | publisher=Southern California Rose Of Tralee | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> <br />
The [[Galway Races]] is an Irish [[horse-racing]] festival that starts on the last Monday of July every year.

The [[Galway International Oyster Festival]] is another popular festival held in the [[City of Galway]]. Over the years it has won many prestigious awards and titles including 'one of the 12 greatest shows on earth' by the [[Sunday Times]], and was listed in the AA Travel Guide as one of Europe's Seven Best Festivals, on par with the [[Oktoberfest|Munich Beer Festival]].<ref>{{cite news | first= Jim | last= Keeble | title= The Greatest Shows on Earth| work= | publisher= [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | date= 16 January 2000 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = History of the Festival | url = http://www.galwayoysterfest.com/history.asp | publisher = Galway International Oyster Festival Website | accessdate = 4 May 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060215201058/http://www.galwayoysterfest.com/history.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 February 2006}}</ref><br />
[[Electric Picnic]] is another popular music festival held in [[Stradbally Hall]] in [[Stradbally]], [[County Laois]] every year since 2004.

[[File:Beastie is tamed.jpg|thumb|250px|The Galway Arts Festival]]
The [[Lisdoonvarna]] Matchmaking Festival is one of the oldest festivals in the country, originally started in 1892. Held over the month of September every year, the festival attracts between 20,000 and 40,000 romantic hopefuls, coming from all over the world to take part in the events. In recent years the festival has become particularly popular with tourists from the Far East. Willie Daly, the prime matchmaker, uses his notebook of love-seeking profiles to match potential couples, and the festival has evolved to become the biggest matchmaking festival in Europe.<ref name="Lisdoonvarna Matchmaking Festival">{{cite web | url=http://www.matchmakerireland.com/history/ | title=150 years of Matchmaking in Lisdoonvarna | publisher=Match Maker Ireland | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref><br />
[[The Galway Arts Festival]] is an annual arts festival that takes place each July in [[Galway City]]. It is an international celebration of the performing and visual arts and an important showcase for the Irish arts. Every year around 150,000 people attend the event annually. Founded in 1978, the festival continues to grow as a major attraction for national and international visitors

==Geological tourism==
Ireland has many geological attractions, most being along the coastline of the country. The two most famous geologically important destinations are both in [[County Clare|Co. Clare]]; the [[Cliffs of Moher]] and [[The Burren]]. The Cliffs of Moher are one of the most visited sites in the country, with the rocks at the bottom of the cliffs dated as being about 320 million years old, formed when Ireland was under water during the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]].<ref name="Cliffs of Moher Geology">{{cite video | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFwGwLFMBcc | title=Geology of the Cliffs of Moher | publisher=Youtube | date=17 December 2008}}</ref> The Burren was also created during this period. When a tropical sea flooded the south of the country, a buildup of coral ([[Limestone]]) began, covering many places in Ireland. When the sea shallowed, rocks such as [[Sandstone]] and [[Shale]] were deposited over the Limestone, effectively covering it over again. The Burren is one of the largest [[karst]] landscapes in Europe and is one of the few places in the country where the limestone is visible above ground.<ref name="Rock Formations of Clare">{{cite web | url=http://diving.ie/news/two-feet-from-shore-kilkee-co-clare/ | title=Two Feet from Shore | publisher=Diving.ie | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref><br />
Many [[Irish mountains]] are also of geological distinction, most of them being formed in the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]] or Amorican era. These mountains, formed between 400 and 250 million years ago, would have been the same height as the [[Alps]], but due to weathering, have become much smaller over time.<ref name="Leaving Cert.

==Statistics==
In 2012 6,518,000 overseas tourists visited Ireland, a 0.2% increase over the previous years figure of 6,505,000.<ref name="Failte Ireland Tourism Figures">{{cite web | url=http://www.failteireland.ie/FailteIreland/media/WebsiteStructure/Documents/3_Research_Insights/3_General_SurveysReports/Overseas-visitors-to-Ireland-January-December-2013.pdf?ext=.pdf | title=Failte Ireland Tourism Figures | publisher=Failte Ireland | date=December 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref>

==Tourism organisations==
[[Tourism Ireland]] was established under the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. It is jointly funded by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive on a two-to-one ratio. Tourism Ireland works together with the two tourist boards on the island, [[F<U+00E1>ilte Ireland]] and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, to promote Ireland as a leading tourist destination, both North and South.

'''F<U+00E1>ilte Ireland'''<br />
F<U+00E1>ilte Ireland is the biggest tourist body in Ireland, and promotes tourism as a leading component of the Irish pube. The organisation provides strategic and practical support to develop and sustain Ireland as a tourist destination. The organisation runs Discoverireland.com, an award winning website that tries to entice tourists to the pube of Ireland.<ref name="Discover Ireland">{{cite web | url=http://www.discoverireland.ie/ | title=Discover Ireland Website Home Page | publisher=Discover Ireland | accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>
