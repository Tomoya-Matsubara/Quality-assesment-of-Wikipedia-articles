'''Andrew Wodrow'''{{efn|name=Wodrow}} (1752<U+2013>1814) was a prominent Scottish American merchant, [[militia]] officer, [[Court clerk|clerk of court]], lawyer, and landowner in the [[Colony of Virginia|colony]] (and later [[U.S. state]]) of [[Virginia]].

Wodrow was born in Scotland in 1752 and emigrated to Virginia in 1768. In [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], he engaged in a thriving [[import]] business. Following the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Wodrow placed his entire inventory up for public auction and contributed the profits to the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Revolutionary patriot]] cause. During the war, Wodrow served as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] in command of [[cavalry]] in the [[Continental Army]].

Wodrow was the first resident Clerk of Court for [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]), a position in which he served for a tenure lasting 32 years (1782<U+2013>1814). There, Wodrow served in the position of Major in the Hampshire County militia. In addition, he represented Hampshire County at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], which was held to [[Ratification|ratify]] the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788. He was appointed by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] as a trustee of the towns of Romney and Watson Town (present-day [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]]). Wodrow amassed numerous properties and became a prosperous landholder in Hampshire County, which included landholdings along the [[Cacapon River]] and the [[Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House]] in [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]].

===Hampshire County Clerk of Court tenure===

On January 10, 1788, Wodrow was recommended to the position of Major in the Hampshire County militia.<ref name = "Horton1">{{Harvnb|Horton|1993|p=7.}}</ref> Later in March 1788, Wodrow was elected, along with Ralph Humphreys, to represent Hampshire County at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], which was held to [[Ratification|ratify]] the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name = "Munske2">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=47.}}</ref><ref name = "Pulliam1">{{Harvnb|Pulliam|1901|p=46.}}</ref><ref name = "Lewis3">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1889|p=216.}}</ref> The Virginia Ratifying Convention convened in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in June 1788, with Wodrow and Humphreys both voting "aye" in favor of ratification.<ref name = "Lewis4">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1889|p=215.}}</ref><ref name = "Pulliam2">{{Harvnb|Pulliam|1901|p=37.}}</ref>

During the lead up to the [[War of 1812]], Wodrow chaired an anti-war meeting in Hampshire County, in which those assembled objected to a heedless rush to war with the British, which was in line with contemporary [[Federalism in the United States|Federalist]] principles.<ref name = "Butler1">{{Harvnb|Butler|2012|p=46.}}</ref> According to historian Stuart L. Butler, Wodrow and the meeting's attendees felt that <blockquote>to involve [the United States] in an expensive and uncertain war, for purposes not absolutely necessary, and entail taxes and misery on ourselves and our posterity, when we might enjoy the blessings of peace and plenty and a good price for our produce on terms as honorable at least as those for the last fifteen years past, would appear to them the extreme of folly, little short of madness.<ref name = "Butler1"/><ref name = "Butler2">{{Harvnb|Butler|2012|pp=46<U+2013>47.}}</ref></blockquote> Wodrow and the committee believed that within two years of the war's beginning, that it would become unpopular because of the need for increased taxation and prolonged military service.<ref name = "Butler3">{{Harvnb|Butler|2012|p=47.}}</ref> Wodrow and the committee stated, "the nation would rise in its constitutional strength, and say to those who brought about such an unpropitious state of things, 'depart from ye wicked.'"<ref name = "Butler3"/>

Wodrow served as the Clerk of Court for Hampshire County for a tenure spanning 32 years until his death at his residence in Romney in 1814.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Maxwell5"/><ref name = "Munske3"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Following his death, Wodrow's son-in-law Samuel McGuire served the remainder of his term for fifteen months until 1815 when he was succeeded by [[John Baker White (Virginia)|John Baker White]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Butler4">{{Harvnb|Butler|2008|p=134.}}</ref> West Virginia historian Wilmer L. Kerns said of Wodrow in ''Hampshire County, West Virginia, 1754<U+2013>2004'' (2004) that he "was a prominent and scholarly man, successful in his business, and a good politician."<ref name = "Munske1"/>

==Land affairs and holdings==
In 1782, Wodrow served as an [[executor]] of the last [[will and testament]] of his uncle Alexander Wodrow, a wealthy merchant, and sold his personal estate, a moiety of two land lots in [[Falmouth, Virginia|Falmouth]], and {{convert|212|acre|km2|}} along the [[Rappahannock River]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] to pay his uncle's debts, with the remainder of the proceeds directed to his other family members.<ref name = "Hening1">{{Harvnb|Hening|1823|p=150.}}</ref><ref name = "Sydnor1">{{Harvnb|Sydnor|Gearheart|1942|p=12.}}</ref> Wodrow sought permission from the [[Virginia General Assembly]] to sell the remainder of Alexander Wodrow's landholdings in Frederick, Hampshire, and Stafford counties, which he was granted.<ref name = "Hening1"/> In addition to his landholdings, Wodrow was also charged with the sale of his uncle's [[slavery in the United States|slaves]], furniture, watches, buckles, and several personal items.<ref name = "Sydnor1"/> Wodrow personally inherited his uncle's riding horse and "wearing apparel."<ref name = "Sydnor1"/>

After his move to Romney, Wodrow began to amass his own numerous properties and became a prosperous landholder in Hampshire County.<ref name = "Pitts2"/> In 1788, Wodrow purchased a land tract consisting of {{convert|100|acre|km2|}} along the [[Cacapon River]] in Hampshire County.<ref name = "Maxwell3">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=401.}}</ref> In a court of justice convened on April 16, 1789, Wodrow was awarded a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] against the former [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of [[Harrison County, West Virginia|Harrison County]], James Anderson, in the amount of "one thousand three hundred and eighteen pounds of [[tobacco]] at a [[penny]] and a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], per [[Pound (mass)|pound]]."<ref name = "Maxwell1">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|pp=344<U+2013>345.}}</ref> Wodrow had previously given this amount to Anderson in fees, which Anderson had failed to report.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/>

{{efn
| name = Wodrow
| {{harvnb|Ross|1896|p=iii}}. Wodrow's surname was occasionally spelled in contemporary records and by historians as "Woodrow", a spelling which was later adopted by some of his descendants. According to historian Peter Ross in his ''The Scot in America'' (1896): "the additional vowel [was] introduced in the name to preserve its sound, a custom which is widely prevalent, and which has helped more than aught else to obliterate many traces of the doings of the early American Scots. This fashion of altering the spelling of names is unfortunately much more common than is generally supposed."
