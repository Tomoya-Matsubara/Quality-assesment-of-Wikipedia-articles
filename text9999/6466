The '''Vanier Cup''' (in {{lang-fr|Coupe Vanier}}) is the name of the championship of  [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] [[CIS football|football]] and the name of the trophy awarded to the victorious team. It is currently played between the winners of the [[Uteck Bowl]] and the [[Mitchell Bowl]]. It is named after [[Georges Vanier]], the former [[Governor General of Canada]] and was first awarded in 1965 to the winner of an invitational event contested between two teams that were selected by a panel. In 1967, the trophy was declared the official "CIAU (now CIS) National Football Championship" and a playoff system was instituted. From it's creation until 1982, it was known as the '''Canadian College Bowl'''. The game typically occurs in late [[November]], although it is occasionally played in [[December]].

In 2007, the Vanier Cup returned to the [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], for the first time since 2003. The 2007 Vanier Cup was part of the [[2007 Grey Cup]] festivities in Toronto.<ref name="Grey Cup press release 2006-11-02">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cflgreycup.ca/toronto/news_110206.php|title=Grey Cup '07 one-day sale a huge success|accessdate=2006-12-03|publisher=CFLGreyCup.ca|year=2006-11-02}}</ref> The title sponsor for the game was the [[Desjardins Group]], the largest association of [[credit union]]s in North America.

==History==
[[Image:Vanier06.png|thumb|left|Logo of the 2007 Vanier Cup]]

The Vanier Cup was created in 1965 as the championship trophy of the Canadian College Bowl. For the first two years of competition, the Canadian College Bowl was an invitational event, with a national panel selecting two teams to play, much like the system employed by American [[college football]] today. In 1967, the Canadian College Bowl was declared the national football championship of the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union, now [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]], with a playoff system determining the two participants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaniercup.ca/index.php?module=page&id=15 |title=Past Vanier Cups|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=vaniercup.ca|year=2007}}</ref> The Vanier Cup was played in [[Toronto, Ontario]], from its inception in 1965 through 2003. However, after the CIS opened the game to host conference bids in 2001, the possibility arose to have games held outside Toronto. The 2004 and 2005 games were hosted by the OUA at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and the 2006 game was hosted by the [[University of Saskatchewan]] at [[Griffiths Stadium]] in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaniercup.ca/index.php?module=newser&func=display&topicnum=&nid=107&writer=0 |title=Desjardins Vanier Cup: Head-to-head Look|date=[[November 21]], [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=vaniercup.ca|year=2007}}</ref> Several times, the game has been played in the same city and during the same weekend as the [[Grey Cup]]. The mist recent year was 2007, but this is not a regular occurance and has only happened a few times.<ref name="CIS press release 2005-11-16"/> The game is regularily broadcast nationally and in 2007 was broadcast by the cable network [[The Score Television Network|The Score]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaniercup.ca/index.php?module=newser&func=display&topicnum=&nid=116&writer=0|title=The Score to broadcast 2007 Desjardins Vanier Cup|accessdate=2007-11-28|publisher=vaniercup.ca|year=2007}}</ref>

Today, the Vanier Cup is played between the winners of the [[Uteck Bowl]] (formerly [[Atlantic Bowl]]) and the [[Mitchell Bowl]] (formerly the [[Churchill Bowl]]). The Uteck and Mitchell Bowls, in turn, are contested by the [[Jewett Trophy|Loney Bowl]] ([[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]]), [[Hardy Trophy|Hardy Cup]] ([[Canada West Universities Athletic Association|Canada West]]), [[Dunsmore Cup]] ([[Quebec Student Sports Federation|QUFL]]), and [[Yates Cup]] ([[Ontario University Athletics|OUA]]) champions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaniercup.ca/index.php?module=page&id=14 |title=Uteck Bowl|accessdate=2007-11-28|publisher=vaniercup.ca|year=2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaniercup.ca/index.php?module=page&id=13|title=Mitchell Bowl|accessdate=2007-11-28|publisher=vaniercup.ca|year=2007}}</ref>

The Vanier Cup's [[most valuable player]] is awarded the Ted Morris Memorial Trophy. It was first awarded in 1965 and was named after Ted Morris, a former member of the [[Toronto Argonauts]] and an organizer of the first bowl. He died before the first game could be played, and the trophy was named after him. The Bruce Coulter Award was first awarded in 1992 and is dependant on what position the winner of the Ted Morris Trophy played. If the winner is from the offense, then the Bruce Coulter Award winner will be a defensive player or vice-versa. It was named after Bruce Coulter, who was the head Coach at both McGill and Bishop<U+2019>s Universities and played with the [[Montr<U+00E9>al Alouettes]] in the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaniercup.ca/index.php?module=page&id=17 |title=Championship All-Stars|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=vaniercup.ca|year=2007}}</ref>
