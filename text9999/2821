==Prelude to Nazi anti-tobacco campaign==
Anti-tobacco sentiment and criticism of smoking existed in [[German Empire|Germany]] in the early 1910s, long before the [[Nazi#History|advent of the Nazis]]. Critics of smoking organized the first group in the country named the ''Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher'' (German Tobacco Opponents' Association for the Protection of Non-smokers). Established in 1904, this organization existed for a brief period only. The next anti-tobacco organization, the ''Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner'' (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in [[Trautenau]], [[Bohemia]]. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of [[Hanover]] and [[Dresden]]. In 1920, a ''Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei'' (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in [[Prague]], after [[Czechoslovakia]] was separated from [[Austria]] at the end of [[World War I]]. A ''Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in [[Deutsch<U+00F6>sterreich]]'' (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Austria) was established in [[Graz]] in 1920.<ref name="NWC177">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=177}}</ref>

These groups started publishing journals critical of smoking. The first such [[German language]] journal was ''Der Tabakgegner'' (The Tobacco Opponents), published by the Bohemian organization. This journal was published between 1912 and 1932. The ''Deutsche Tabakgegner'' (German Tobacco Opponents) was published in Dresden, and was the second journal on this issue, being published from 1919 to 1935.<ref name="NWC177"/> Apart from opposing tobacco smoking, the anti-tobacco organizations were against consumption of [[Ethanol#Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] also. This opposition to [[alcoholic beverage]]s remained significant for the anti-tobacco campaign by the Nazis.<ref name="NWC178">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=178}}</ref><ref name="BMJGDS">{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/329/7480/1424?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=Free+in+PMC+Lifestyle%2C+health%2C+and+health+promotion+in+Nazi+Germany.&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype|title=Lifestyle, health, and health promotion in Nazi Germany|author=George Davey Smith|date=[[2004-12-18]]|format=HTML|accessdate=2008-07-01|publisher=British Medical Journal}}</ref>

==Hitler's attitude towards smoking==
[[Image:Adolf Hitler cph 3a48970.jpg|thumb|right|Hitler encouraged his close associates to give up smoking and rewarded those who quit it.]]
[[Adolf Hitler]] was a heavy smoker in his early life when he used to smoke approximately 25 to 40 cigarettes daily, but gave up smoking after coming to the conclusion that it was a waste of money.<ref name="NWC219">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=219}}</ref> In later years, Hitler viewed smoking as "decadent"<ref name="HRCPL1374"/> and "the wrath of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Red Man]] against the White Man, vengeance for having been given [[hard liquor]]",<ref name="NWC219"/> lamenting over the fact that "so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning".<ref name="NWC173">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=173}}</ref> Hitler is often considered to be the first national leader to advocate nonsmoking.<ref name="BDDENI119">{{Harvnb|Tillman|2004|Ref=CITEREFTillman2004|p=119}}</ref> He was unhappy because both [[Eva Braun]] and [[Martin Bormann]] were smokers and was concerned over [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]]'s continued smoking in public places. He became angry when a statue of G<U+00F6>ring showed a [[cigar]] in his mouth.<ref name="NWC219"/>

Hitler felt regret over the fact that military personnel were permitted to smoke, and during [[World War II]] he said on March 2, 1942, "it was a mistake, traceable to the army leadership at the time, at the beginning of the war". He also said that it was "not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking". He promised to terminate the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war. Hitler personally encouraged people who he knew very well not to smoke and rewarded those who [[Smoking cessation|quit smoking]]. However Hitler's personal distaste for tobacco was not the main cause behind Nazi anti-tobacco movement; it was only one of several catalysts behind the anti-smoking campaign.<ref name="NWC219"/>

==Reproductive policies==
The Nazi [[Nazi Germany#Women's rights|reproductive policies]] were a significant factor behind their anti-tobacco campaign.<ref name="BMJGDS"/> Women who smoked were considered to be vulnerable to premature [[ageing|aging]] and loss of [[physical attractiveness]] and were generally viewed as being not very suitable for their roles as wives and mothers of a German family. Werner Huttig of the [[Nazi Party]]'s ''[[Office of Racial Policy|Rassenpolitisches Amt]]'' (Office of Racial Politics) claimed that [[breast milk]] of smoking mothers was revealed to contain [[nicotine]].<ref name="NWC187">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=187}}</ref> Martin Staemmler, a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in increasing the number of [[stillbirth]]s and [[miscarriage]]s. The responsibility of smoking for miscarriages was also supported by well-known female [[racial hygiene|racial hygienist]] Agnes Bluhm, who in a book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted the German women to give birth to more children. An article published in a German [[gynaecology]] journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more prone to remain childless compared to women who did not smoke.<ref name="NWC189">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=189}}</ref>

==Research==
Research and studies on the effects of tobacco on the health of the population was more advanced in Germany than any nation by the time the Nazis came to power.<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/>. The [[Lung cancer#Smoking|link]] between [[lung cancer]] and tobacco was first proved in Germany before the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s,<ref name="NWC173"/><ref name=IJEOANSFRIPH>{{cite web|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/3/537|title=Odol, Autobahne and a non-smoking F<U+00FC>hrer: Reflections on the innocence of public health|author=Johan P.

In 1930, Lickint published a paper entitled "Tobacco and tobacco smoke as [[Etiology|aetiological]] factors for carcinoma", which was one the earliest, if not the first review papers on the subject. This paper included 167 literature citations. Lickint belonged to the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a party opposed to the Nazis, which Hitler banned in 1933. He was also a member of the ''Vereins sozialistischer <U+00C4>rzte'' (Association of socialist doctors) and was dismissed in 1934 from his position at K<U+00FC>chwald hospital in [[Chemnitz]] by the Nazis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecomed-medizin.de/sj/sfp/Pdf/aId/6824 |language=German |title=Fritz Lickint (1898-1960) <U+2013> Ein Leben als Aufkl<U+00E4>rer <U+00FC>ber die Gefahren des Tabaks |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Research projects were funded by the Nazis which revealed many disastrous effects of smoking on health.<ref name="INJPR98">{{Harvnb|Coombs|Holladay|2006|Ref=CITEREFCoombsHolladay2006|p=98}}</ref>  Nazi Germany supported [[Epidemiology|epidemiological research]] on the harmful effects of tobacco use.<ref name="PHCM252">{{Harvnb|Young|2005|Ref=CITEREFYoung2005|p=252}}</ref> Hitler personally gave financial support to the ''Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren'' (Scientific Institute for the Study of Tobacco Hazards) at the [[University of Jena]], headed by Karl Astel.<ref name="HRCPL1374"/><ref name="NWC207">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=207}}</ref> Established in 1941, it was the most significant anti-tobacco institute in Nazi Germany.<ref name="NWC207"/>

Franz H. M<U+00FC>ller in 1939 and E. Schairer in 1943 first used [[case-control]] epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers.<ref name="HRCPL1374"/> In 1939, M<U+00FC>ller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany which demonstrated that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers.<ref name="PHCM252"/> M<U+00FC>ller, described as the "forgotten father of experimental epidemiology",<ref name="NWC191">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=191}}</ref> was a member of the [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK) and the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers<U+2019> Party]] (NSDAP). M<U+00FC>ller's 1939 medical dissertation was the world's first controlled epidemiological study of the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer. Apart from mentioning the increasing incidents of lung cancer and the general causes behind it like dust, exhaust gas from cars, [[tuberculosis]], X-ray and pollutants emitted from factories, M<U+00FC>ller's paper pointed out that "the significance of tobacco smoke has been pushed more and more into the foreground".<ref name="NWC194">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=194}}</ref>

Physicians in the Third Reich were aware of the fact that smoking is responsible for [[cardiac disease]]s, which were considered to be the most serious diseases resulting from smoking. Use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increasing reports of [[myocardial infarction]] in the country. In the later years of World War II, nicotine was viewed by researchers as a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. A pathologist of the [[Heer (1935-1945)|Heer]] examined thirty-two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front, and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were "enthusiastic smokers." He cited the opinion of pathologist Franz Buchner that cigarettes are "a coronary poison of the first order."<ref name="NWC187"/>

==Anti-tobacco measures==

[[Image:Tabak-Kapital.gif|thumb|right|A Nazi anti-smoking ad portraying the devilish "Tobacco capital" raining down tobacco products to spoil the "people's health", "labor power", "demographic political goals", and the "people's wealth"]]
The Nazis used several public relations tactics to influence the general population of Germany into not smoking. Some well-known health magazines like the ''Gesundes Volk'' (Healthy People) published warnings regarding the effects of smoking. Posters showing the harmful effects of smoking were published and anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces. Anti-smoking messages were spread through the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler-Jugend]] (HJ) and the [[League of German Girls|Bund Deutscher M<U+00E4>del]] (BDM).<ref name="INJPR98"/> The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education.<ref name="SGHS328"/><ref name="MHSDPHB13">{{Harvnb|Berridge|2007|Ref=CITEREFBerridge2007|p=13}}</ref> In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the ''Reichsstelle f<U+00FC>r Rauschgiftbek<U+00E4>mpfung'' (Bureau for the Struggle against Addictive Drugs) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines ''Die Genussgifte'' (The Benefit Poisons), ''Auf der Wacht'' (On the Guard) and ''Reine Luft'' (Clean Air).<ref name="NWC199">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=199}}</ref>

After recognizing the harmful effects of smoking on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted.<ref name=BMJSD>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/310/6976/396?ijkey=dded75b860ab74f5194afe48718a4f2e5fe51cb0&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|title=Smoking and death|author=George Davey Smith, Sabine Strobele and Matthias Egger|date=[[1995-02-11]]|format=HTML|accessdate=2008-06-01|publisher=British Medical Journal}}</ref> The later 1930s increasingly saw anti-tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis. In 1938, the [[Luftwaffe]] and the [[Reichspost]] imposed a ban on smoking. Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions, but also in several public offices and in rest homes.<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/> Midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed smoking in all of its offices premises, and [[Heinrich Himmler]], the then chief of the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty.<ref name="NWC203">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=203}}</ref> Smoking was also outlawed in schools.<ref name="INJPR98"/>

In 1941, tobacco smoking in trams was outlawed in Germany's sixty large urban settlements.<ref name="NWC203"/> Smoking was outlawed in [[bomb shelter]]s also; however a few of these structures had separate rooms for smoking.<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/> Special care was taken to prevent women from smoking. The President of the Medical Association in Germany announced, "German women don't smoke".<ref name="PCMCCEA169">{{Harvnb|Daunton|Hilton|2001|Ref=CITEREFDauntonHilton2001|p=169}}</ref>  [[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women and women [[Aging#Dividing the lifespan|below the age of 25 and over the age of 55]] were not given tobacco ration cards during World War II. Restrictions were imposed on the hospitality and food retailing industry also such as restaurants and coffeehouses so that they could not sell tobacco products like cigarettes to women.<ref name="NWC203"/> Anti-tobacco films aimed at women were created and publicly shown. Editorials were published in [[:Category:Nazi newspapers|newspapers]] which discussed the issue of smoking and its effects. Strict measures were taken in this regard and a district department of the [[National Socialist Factory Cell Organization]] (NSBO) announced that it would expel [[:Category:Female Nazis|female members]] who smoked publicly.<ref name="NCFWTR108">{{Harvnb|Guenther|2004|Ref=CITEREFGuenther2004|p=108}}</ref> The next step in the anti-tobacco campaign came in July 1943, when public smoking for persons under the age of 18 was outlawed.<ref name="NWC203"/><ref name="BMJGDS"/> In the next year, smoking in buses and city trains was made illegal,<ref name="HRCPL1374"/> on the personal initiative of Hitler, who feared that female ticket takers might be the victims of passive smoking.<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/>

Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products,<ref name="GB206">{{Harvnb|Uekoetter|2006|Ref=CITEREFUekoetter2006|p=206}}</ref> enacted on December 7, 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or smoking as an expression of masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed,<ref name="NWC204">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=204}}</ref> as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also made illegal.<ref name="NWC206">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=206}}</ref>

Restrictions on smoking were introduced in the Wehrmacht also. Any soldier in the Wehrmacht was not given more than six cigarettes a day. Often extra cigarettes were sold to the soldiers, especially when there was no military advance or retreat in the battleground, however these were restricted to 50 for each person per month. Access to cigarettes was not allowed for the Wehrmacht's [[Women%27s roles in the World Wars#Germany|female auxiliary personnel]]. Medical lectures were also arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking. An ordinance was enacted on November 3, 1941 which raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80%-95% of the retail price. It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany for more than 25 years after the [[Nazi Germany#Capitulation of German forces|collapse of the Nazi regime]].<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/>

==Effectiveness==
[[Image:German cigarette production.jpeg|thumb|right|Production of cigarettes in Germany from 1932 to 1944.]]
The early anti-smoking campaign was largely a failure, and the years from 1933 to 1937 saw a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany.<ref name="NWC228"/> The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring [[France]], where the anti-tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630.<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/><ref>Lee PN, ed. ''Tobacco consumption in various countries.'' 4th ed. London: Tobacco Research Council, 1975.</ref> 

The cigarette manufacturing companies in Germany made several attempts to weaken the anti-tobacco campaign. They published many new journals and tried to depict the anti-tobacco movement as "fanatic" and "unscientific".<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/> The [[tobacco industry]] also tried to counter the [[Nazi Germany#Government|government]] campaign to prevent women from smoking and used smoking models in their advertisements.<ref name="PCMCCEA169"/> Despite government regulations, many women in Germany regularly smoked, including the wives of many high-ranking Nazi officials. For instance, [[Magda Goebbels]] smoked even while giving an interview to a journalist. Fashion illustrations showing women with cigarettes were often published in prominent publications such as the ''Beyers Mode f<U+00FC>r Alle'' (Beyers Fashion For All). The cover of the popular song ''[[Lili Marleen]]'' showed singer [[Lale Andersen]] with a cigarette.<ref name="NCFWTR108"/> 

The Nazis implemented more and more anti-tobacco policies at the end of the 1930s and by the early years of [[World War II]], the rate of the tobacco usage experienced a decline. As a result of the anti-tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht,<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/> the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945.<ref name="HRCPL1374"/> According to a survey conducted in the 1944, the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht, but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 23.4% compared to the immediate pre-World War II years. The number of people who used smoke 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 4.4% to 0.3%.<ref name=BMJATCNLKAPHG/> Below is a comparison of [[Per capita|per capita]] cigarette consumption rate per year in Germany and the [[United States]] from 1930 to 1944.

==Controversies==
===Racism and anti-smoking sentiment===
There is some controversy over the attitude of the Nazis for the anti-tobacco movement as they equated the anti-tobacco campaign with both [[racism]] and [[antisemitism]].<ref name="BMJGDS"/> Apart from the public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology.<ref name="INJPR98"/> The anti-tobacco movement was influenced by the ideological concept of [[racial hygiene]] and bodily purity.<ref name="NWC174">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=174}}</ref> Nazi leaders held a view that it was not right for the [[master race]] to smoke<ref name="INJPR98"/> and tobacco consumption became equal to "racial degeneracy".<ref name="NWC220">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=220}}</ref> According to the Nazi view, tobacco was a "genetic poison"<ref name="NWC174"/> and racial hygienists opposed tobacco out of the fear that tobacco would "corrupt" the "German germ plasm".<ref name="NWC179">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=179}}</ref> Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a "vice" of the "degenerate" [[African]]s.<ref name="NWC174"/>

===Antisemitism in the anti-tobacco campaign===
The Nazis often equated the [[Jew]]s with the harmful effects of tobacco. The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews.<ref name="NWC179"/> [[Johann von Leers]], editor of the ''Nordische Welt'' (Nordic World), during the opening ceremony of the ''Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren'' in 1941, proclaimed that "Jewish capitalism" was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across [[Europe]]. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in [[Amsterdam]], which was the principal European entry point of ''[[Nicotiana]]''.<ref name="NWC208">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=208}}</ref>

==After World War II==
After the collapse of the Nazi Germany at the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of World War II]], [[:Category:Tobacco companies of the United States|American cigarette manufactures]] quickly entered the German market. Illegal [[smuggling]] of tobacco became prevalent,<ref name="NWC245">{{Harvnb|Proctor|1999|Ref=CITEREFProctor1999|p=245}}</ref> and the majority of the leaders of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign were silenced by various methods.<ref name=ADLNMPHP/> In 1949, approximately 400 million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally  every month. In 1954, nearly two billion [[Switzerland|Swiss]] cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and [[Italy]]. As part of the [[Marshall Plan]], the United States sent tobacco free of cost to Germany: the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24000 tons and reaching as many as 69000 tons in 1949. The [[Federal government of the United States]] spent $70 million in this scheme, to the delight of cigarette manufacturing companies in the United States, who were making a huge profit out of it.<ref name="NWC245"/> Per capita yearly cigarette consumption in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]] steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1,523 in 1963. The present day anti-tobacco campaign in Germany has been unable to exceed the seriousness of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939-1941 and the situation of German tobacco health research at the end of the 20th century is described by [[Robert N. Proctor]] as being "muted".<ref name="NWC228"/>
