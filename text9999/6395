'''''Andrei Pervozvanny''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439> <U+041F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+043E><U+0437><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439>}}<U+2014>[[Saint Andrew|St Andrew the First-Called]]) was a {{sclass|Andrei Pervozvanny|battleship|0}} [[predreadnought battleship]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] during the mid-1900s. The ship's construction was seriously extended by design changes as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and labor unrest after the [[1905 Revolution]], and she took nearly six years to build. ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' was not very active during [[World War I]] and her bored sailors joined the general [[mutiny]] of the [[Baltic Fleet]] in early 1917. She was used by the [[Bolsheviks]] to bombard the rebellious garrison of [[Krasnaya Gorka fort|Fort Krasnaya Gorka]] during the [[<U+202F>Russian Civil War]] in 1919 and was [[British Campaign in the Baltic 1918<U+2013>1919 | torpedoed by British]] [[Coastal Motor Boat]]s shortly afterwards, as part of the [[allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]].  The ship was never fully repaired and was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1923.

==Description==
''Andrei Pervozvanny'' was {{convert|454|ft|m|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|460|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert |80|ft|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull) | draft]] of {{convert |27|ft|m|1}}.  She displaced {{convert |18580|LT|t}} at [[deep load]].  Her hull was subdivided by 17 transverse watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and the engine rooms were divided by a centerline longitudinal bulkhead. She had a [[double bottom]] and a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|4|ft|m|1}}. The ship's crew consisted of 31 officers and 924 crewmen.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 180<U+2013>81, 185</ref>

''Andrei Pervozvanny'' had two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion | vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] with a total designed output of {{convert |17600|ihp|lk=on}}. Twenty-five Belleville [[water-tube boiler]]s provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of {{convert|285|psi|kPa kg/cm2|lk=on}}. On [[sea trial]]s, the engines produced {{convert|17635|ihp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|18.5|knots}}. She carried a normal load of {{convert|800|LT|t}} of coal that provided a range of {{convert|1300|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a maximum load of {{convert|1500|LT|t}} that gave {{convert|2400|nmi}} at the same speed.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 181, 187</ref>

The main armament consisted of two pairs of [[Russian 12 inch 40 caliber naval gun|{{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} Model 1895]] 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns mounted in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft. These guns had a maximum elevation of 35<U+00B0> and could depress to -5<U+00B0>. Eighty rounds per gun were carried and they could fire one round per minute. Eight of the fourteen {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} Model 1905 45-caliber guns were mounted in four twin-gun turret at the corners of the superstructure while six were mounted in [[casemate]]s in the superstructure. For defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' carried twelve {{convert|120|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns mounted in casemates above the 8-inch guns in the superstructure. Two underwater {{convert|450|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted, one on each side, and they were provided with six spare torpedoes.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 186</ref> 

Based on the Russian experience at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], the sides of the ship's hull were completely protected by [[Krupp cemented armor]]. The main waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|8.5|in|0}} and the upper belt was {{convert|5|in|0}} at its thickest. The sides of the main gun turrets were {{convert|8|in|0}} thick and the armor of the casemates ranged from {{convert|3.1|to|5|in|0}} in thickness. The greatest thickness of [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{convert|1.5|in|0}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 181</ref>

==Service history==
''Andrei Pervozvanny'' was built by the [[Admiralty Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Construction began on 15 March 1904<ref group=Note>All dates used in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]</ref> and was officially laid down on 11 May. Her construction was slowed by labor trouble in the shipyard from the 1905 Revolution. She was launched on 30 October 1906 and began her sea trials in September 1910. They were completed in October 1910, but the ship entered service on 10 March 1911.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 180</ref> ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' joined the Baltic Fleet on completion and she made a port visit to [[Copenhagen]] in September 1912. The following September she visited [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], [[Cherbourg]], and [[Stavanger]] together with her [[sister ship]], {{ship |Russian battleship|Imperator Pavel I||2}}. She ran aground on [[Odensholm]] Island, off the Estonian coast, on 1 July 1914. The ship was still under repair when World War I began the following month. Her lattice masts were cut down and light topmasts were added while under repair.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 188, 302</ref>

''Andrei Pervozvanny'' was mostly inactive during the war as the Russian naval strategy in the Baltic was defensive and they did not intend to seek out the German fleet.<ref name=m8>McLaughlin, p. 188</ref> [[Torpedo net]]s were fitted in early 1915 and the ship's torpedoes were removed in January 1916. In late 1916, four {{convert|76|mm|0|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns were added.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 302</ref> The ship's crew joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in [[Helsinki]] on 16 March 1917, after they received word of the [[February Revolution]] in Saint Petersburg, and several of the ship's officers were murdered by the crew. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent [[Finland]] even though the [[Gulf of Finland]] was still frozen over. ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' and her sister ship the renamed ''Respublika'', led the second group of ships on 5 April and reached [[Kronstadt]] five days later in what became known as the [[Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet|"Ice Voyage"]].<ref name=m8/>

After the [[October Revolution]] in 1918, the ship remained on active duty as part of the [[Soviet Navy|Red Navy]] during the Russian Civil War. Between 13 and 15 June 1919, ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' and the [[dreadnought]] {{ship |Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1911|2}} bombarded [[Krasnaya Gorka fort|Fort Krasnaya Gorka]] whose garrison had mutinied against the Bolsheviks. The ship fired 170 12-inch and 408 8-inch shells<ref name=m22>McLaughlin, p. 322</ref> and the garrison surrendered on 17 June when [[Leon Trotsky]] promised them their lives, only to order them machine-gunned.<ref>Head, p. 223</ref> ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' was attacked by the [[Royal Navy]] during its [[British Campaign in the Baltic 1918<U+2013>1919 | Campaign in the Baltic 1918<U+2013>19]], when she was torpedoed by either C.M.B.31 or C.M.B.88 during the night of 17/18 August 1919 as the ship lay at anchor in Kronstadt. She was hit on the port bow and settled {{convert|2|ft|1}} down by the bow. The British claimed three torpedo hits, but two of the torpedoes actually struck the harbor wall behind the battleship. The [[Victoria Cross]], Britain's highest military decoration, was awarded to [[Commander]] [[Claude Congreve Dobson]] and [[Lieutenant]] [[Gordon Charles Steele]] for their successful attack.<ref>Head, pp. 229, 232</ref> The ship was raised and docked, but never fully repaired.<ref name=m22 />  While under repair, she was nearly hit by a small bomb during a British air raid on 3 September.<ref>Head, p. 233</ref>  Scrapping of ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' began 15 December 1923,<ref>Melnikov, p. 96.</ref> although she was not formally stricken until 21 November 1925.<ref name=m8/>
