'''Hurricane Cosme''' was the third named [[Tropical Cyclone|tropical cyclone]] of the [[2013 Pacific hurricane season]].  The storm system formed on June 23, 2013 as a [[tropical depression]] approximately five hundred miles south of  [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mexico]].  The cyclone became a [[tropical storm]] on June 24, and soon after formed into a [[hurricane]] on June 25.  While initially stationary, the storm system started to move in a north westerly direction,<ref>{{Cite report

	The first damage caused by Hurricane Cosme occurred on the [[Revillagigedo Islands]]  where the storm system created 42&nbsp;mph winds.  As The storm system moved towards Mexico it caused heavy rains and flooding within the state of Guerro.  These rains also resulted in 24 [[landslide]]s within the state.  In Colima [[flood]]ing resulted in the structural damage of several public facilities, private buildings, and approximately fifty homes.  At least two people died as a result of the storm system. The first was a tourist who drowned in [[Zihuatanejo]].  The second was a police officer who was killed in an automobile accident that also injured 19 others.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.xeu.com.mx/nota.cfm?id=529018 |title= Hurricane Cosme Leaves Two Dead in Guerrero |last1= Newsroom |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 25 June 2013 |website= XEU.com  |publisher= XEU |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/cosme-se-vuelve-huracan-y-afecta-a-guerrero-1372206717 |title= Cosme Becomes Hurricane, Affects Guerrero |last1= Agencies |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 25 June 2013 |website= zocalo.com |publisher= Zocalo Saltillo |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fahrenheitmagazine.com/conciencia/planeta/ciclon-cosme-se-aleja-de-mexico/ |title= Cosme Cyclone Moves Away from Mexico |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=26 June 2013 |website= Fahrenheitmagazine.com |publisher= Farenheit Magazine |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/932492.html |title= Damage to Beaches in Colima by Cosme |last1= Quiles |first1= Alfredo |last2= |first2= |date=27 June 2013 |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>

	Hurrican Cosme arrived at its greatest intensity (75 kt ) at approximately 0000 UTC on June 26 about 345 miles southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]], Mexico.  Subsequently, stable air and lower water temperatures caused the storm to lose strength.  The system continued to weaken and moved in a westward direction where it eventually weakened into a low pressure surface [[Trough (meteorology)|through]] approximately 1400 miles south east of the [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref>{{Cite report

== Meteorological history ==
{{storm path|Cosme 2013 track.png}}
Hurricane Cosme can be traced to a [[tropical wave]] that formed on the west coast of [[Africa]] on or around the 8th of June.  That westward moving wave, which was also responsible for the formation of [[Tropical Storm Barry (2013)|Tropical Storm Barry]] in the [[Caribbean Sea|South Caribbean Sea]], eventually reached the Eastern [[Pacific Ocean]].  The progress of the wave was slowed by a southwesterly movement withing the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].<ref>{{Cite report |last= Stewart |first= Stacy | authorlink = | coauthors  =  | date       = 7 October 2013 | title      = NHC Tropical Cyclone Report, Tropical Storm Barry (Al022013) | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL022013_Barry.pdf | publisher  = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | format     = PDF  | others     = | edition    = | location   = | chapter    = | section    = | page       = | pages      = | docket     = | accessdate = 5 March 2014 | quote      =

==Preparations and forecasting==
Mexican news organizations and government agencies began reporting on the progress of Hurricane Cosme as early as the 24th of June. SINAPROC issued various warnings regarding the storm on the 24th and 25 of June.  Mexican authorities remained active throughout the disturbance and Government officials began surveying and rebuilding damaged infrastructure as early as the 27th of June.    Multiple ports closed down small craft operation because of the weather.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/932192.html |title= Cosme Damaged beach restaurants in Colima |last1= Quiles |first1= Alfredo |last2= |first2= |date=26 June 2013 |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/932289.html |title= Ends in Mazatlan port for Porposes of Cosme |last1= Gaxiola |first1= Yovana |last2= |first2= |date=26 June 2013 |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>  At least one death was caused when a tourist ignored these closures and was thrown overboard while operating a small boat during the storm.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/932038.html |title= Hurricane Cosme Kill Two in Guerrero |last1= Covarrubias |first1= Adriana |last2= |first2= |date=25 June 2013 |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>

When Cosme became a tropical storm on the 24th of June the [[Servicio Meteorol<U+00F3>gico Nacional (Mexico)|Mexican National Weather Service]] (Servicio Meteorologico Nacional NWS)reported that it could create heavy rains in the western area of the country.  Rainfall as a result of the storm was predicted to range from "intense" (70 to 150 liters per square meter) to "heavy" (greater than 150 liters per square meter) in the states of Colima, Jalisco, Guerrero, Michoacan, and Oaxaca.  The NWS also that "because of its wide circulation, [Comse] generates significant potential for landslides and intense rain...waves 4 to 5 meters high and strong gusts of wind along the coast." <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/931678.html |title= Prevent Rain in 5 States by Storm Cosme |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>   Based on these forecasts the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC) initially issued a green alert "low risk" hurricane warning within the states of Jalisco, Michoacan, and Colima, as well as a blue alert "minimum risk'hurricane warning  for the states of Nayarit and Guerrero.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/931902.html |title= Cosme Strengthens and moves away from Mexican Coast |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>  The continued strengthening of Cosme caused SINAPROC to issue a blue alert to Baja California Sur, stating that the system has strong potential to cause heavy rains despite its relatively long distance off shore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/932042.html |title= BS Decrees Blue Alert for Hurricane Cosme |last1= Rodriguez |first1= Gladys |last2= |first2= |date= |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>

According to the [[NOAA]], Hurricane Cosme was well forecast.  Several global weather models predicted the formation of the storm system about a week prior to the storm's formation.  A "high chance of formation" was issued 36 hours prior to the genesis of the storm system.  Official forecast track errors were lower than average for forecasts within the previous five year average.  However, CLIPER errors were larger than average.  Official intensity forecasts by the NHC were more accurate than the average accuracy for predictions within the last five years.  There were no warnings issued within the United States as a result of Hurricane Cosme.<ref>{{Cite report

==Impact==

Hurricane Cosme caused minor, but wide-spread, damage on main land Mexico as it moved westward. Unstable structures, such as those made of wood and coconut, suffered the most damage as a result of the storm.  Flooding was also a major cause of storm damage while multiple landslides caused road blockages.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fahrenheitmagazine.com/conciencia/planeta/ciclon-cosme-se-aleja-de-mexico/ |title= Cosme Cyclone Moves Away from Mexico |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=26 June 2013 |website= Fahrenheitmagazine.com |publisher= Farenheit Magazine |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/932492.html |title= Damage to Beaches in Colima by Cosme |last1= Quiles |first1= Alfredo |last2= |first2= |date=27 June 2013 |website= El Universal United |publisher= El Universal |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>  Most of the injuries as a result of the storm came from automobile accidents that were operating during the inclement weathers, causing at least one death and 19 injuries.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.xeu.com.mx/nota.cfm?id=529018 |title= Hurricane Cosme Leaves Two Dead in Guerrero |last1= Newsroom |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 25 June 2013 |website= XEU.com  |publisher= XEU |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/cosme-se-vuelve-huracan-y-afecta-a-guerrero-1372206717 |title= Cosme Becomes Hurricane, Affects Guerrero |last1= Agencies |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 25 June 2013 |website= zocalo.com |publisher= Zocalo Saltillo |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>  As early as the 25th of June Hurricane Cosme was causing inclement weather on mainland Mexico.
