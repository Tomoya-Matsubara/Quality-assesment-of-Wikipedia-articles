'''RAF Warwick''' is a former [[Royal Air Force]] relief landing ground located {{Convert|1.7|mi}} south west of [[Warwick]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]], {{Convert|7.9|mi}} east of [[Henley-in-Arden]], Warwickshire. RAF Warwick was opened on a large grass field called Tournament field<ref name="AW1">{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantikwall.co.uk/atlantikwall/warwickshire/warwick01/html/page01.htm |title=RAF Warwick RLG, Warwickshire |publisher=Atlantik Wall|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> in December 1941 and was closed on the 4th February 1946.<ref name="ABCT"/>

===Based units===

The first unit to use the station was No. 1 Flying Instructors School (FIS) operating [[Airspeed Oxford]]s and [[Avro Tutor]]s which taught flying instructors. The main base was [[RAF Church Lawford]] but Warwick and [[RAF Hockley Heath]] were satellites where aircraft were dispersed. 1FIS was previously [[No. 2 Central Flying School]] but changed to the current name on 13 January 1941. On 27 October 1942 1FIS was disbanded and turned into [[No.18 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit]].<ref name="AAFLU">{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk/marg/flying_units.htm |title=Military flying units in the south west Midlands |publisher=Aviation Archaeology|accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>

[[No.18 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit]] ((P)AFU) flew Oxfords and [[Boulton Paul Defiant]]s mainly from RAF Church Lawford but Warwick and other stations were used as satellites. The unit operated between 27 October 1942 and 29 May 1945.<ref name="AAFLU"/>
