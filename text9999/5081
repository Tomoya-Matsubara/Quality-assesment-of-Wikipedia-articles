"'''Like a Rolling Stone'''" is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]]. Its confrontational lyrics originate in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling [[Bob Dylan UK Tour 1965|tour of England]]. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus.  When the original hand-written lyrics were put up for auction in 2014, the manuscript revealed that Dylan made many attempts to construct a rhyme scheme around the refrain "How does it feel?". "Like a Rolling Stone" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]''.

During a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in [[3/4 time]]. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a [[rock music]] format, and rookie session musician [[Al Kooper]] improvised the [[Organ (music)|organ]] riff for which the track is known. However, [[Columbia Records]] was unhappy with both the song's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when a month later a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, "Like a Rolling Stone" reached number two in the US ''Billboard'' charts (number one in ''Cashbox'') and became a worldwide hit.

The track has been described as revolutionary in its combination of different musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan's voice, and the directness of the question "How does it feel?". "Like a Rolling Stone" transformed Dylan's career and is today considered one of the most influential compositions in post-war popular music and has since its release been both a music industry and popular culture milestone which elevated Dylan's image to iconic. The song has been covered by numerous artists, varying from [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] to [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]] and [[Green Day]].

==Writing and recording==
In the spring of 1965, returning from the tour of England documented in the film ''[[Dont Look Back]]'', Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, as well as the direction his career was going, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, he described his dissatisfaction: "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation&nbsp;... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you."<ref>Hentoff, Nat. ''Playboy'', March 1966, reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|p=97}}</ref>

The basis of the song came from an extended piece of verse. In 1966, Dylan described the genesis of "Like a Rolling Stone" to journalist [[Jules Siegel]]:

{{quote|It was ten pages long. It wasn't called anything, just a rhythm thing on paper all about my steady hatred directed at some point that was honest. In the end it wasn't hatred, it was telling someone something they didn't know, telling them they were lucky. Revenge, that's a better word. I had never thought of it as a song, until one day I was at the piano, and on the paper it was singing, "How does it feel?" in a slow motion pace, in the utmost of slow motion.<ref>Siegel, Jules. "Well, What Have We Here?", ''Saturday Evening Post'', July 30, 1966, reprinted in {{harvnb|McGregor|1972|p=159}}</ref>}}

During 1965, Dylan composed prose, poems, and songs by typing incessantly. Footage of Dylan in his suite at the [[Savoy Hotel]], London, captures this process in ''Dont Look Back''. But he told two interviewers that "Like a Rolling Stone" began as a long piece of "vomit" (in one account 10 pages, in another 20 pages) which then acquired musical form.<ref>Heylin, 2009, p. 240. Heylin speculates that Dylan typed a long piece of "vomit" as "quite possibly a conscious imitation of [[Jack Kerouac|Kerouac's]] fabled 'scroll' version of ''[[On the Road]]''.</ref> He never spoke of any other major composition in this way. In an interview with [[CBC radio]] in [[Montreal]], Dylan called the creation of the song a "breakthrough", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing "this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single. And I'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me that was what I should do&nbsp;... After writing that I wasn't interested in writing a novel, or a play. I just had too much, I want to write songs."<ref>Dylan interviewed by Marvin Bronstein, CBC, Montreal, February 20, 1966. Quoted by {{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|p=70}}</ref>

From the extended version on paper, Dylan crafted four verses and the chorus in [[Woodstock, New York]].<ref name="Shelton 1986 279">{{harvnb|Shelton|1986|p=279}}</ref> In 2014, when the hand-written lyrics were put up for auction, the four page manuscript revealed that the full refrain of the chorus does not appear until the fourth page. A rejected third line, "like a dog without a bone" gives way to "now you<U+2019>re unknown". Earlier, Dylan had considered working the name Al Capone into the rhyme scheme, and he attempted to construct a rhyme scheme for "how does it feel?", penciling in "it feels real," "does it feel real," "shut up and deal," "get down and kneel" and "raw deal."<ref name = "nyt"/> The song was written on an upright piano in the key of G sharp and was changed to C on the guitar in the recording studio.<ref name="Creswellp534">{{harvnb|Creswell|2006|p=534}}</ref>

For the recording session, Dylan invited [[Mike Bloomfield]] from the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] to play lead guitar. Asked by Dylan to visit his house in Woodstock for the weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield later recalled: "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't want any of that [[B.B. King]] stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want? We messed around with the song. I played the way that he dug, and he said it was groovy."<ref>{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|p=110}}</ref>

The recording sessions were produced by [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] on June 15<U+2013>16, 1965, in Studio A of [[Columbia Records]], 799 Seventh Avenue, in New York City.<ref name="CONSIDINE"/><ref name="Marcus203">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|p=203}}</ref><ref name="Marcus NPR">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (2)|p=110}}</ref> This would be the last song Wilson would produce for Dylan.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32, track 3}} In addition to Bloomfield, the other musicians enlisted were [[Paul Griffin (musician)|Paul Griffin]] on piano, Joe Macho, Jr. on bass, [[Bobby Gregg]] on drums, and [[Bruce Langhorne]] on tambourine,<ref name="Marcus NPR" /> all booked by Wilson.

On the first day, five takes of the song were recorded in a markedly different style from the eventual release<U+2014>a 3/4 waltz time, with Dylan on piano. The lack of sheet music meant the song was played by ear. However the essence of the song was discovered in the course of the chaotic session. They did not reach the first chorus until the fourth take, but after the following harmonica fill Dylan interrupted, saying, "My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?"<ref name="Marcus234">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|p=234}}</ref> This take was subsequently released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1<U+2013>3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961<U+2013>1991]]''.<ref name="Marcus234"/><ref name="Marcusday1">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|pp=203<U+2013>210}}</ref> The session ended shortly afterwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|p=210}}</ref>

When the session re-convened the following day, June 16, [[Al Kooper]] joined the proceedings. Kooper, at that time a 21-year-old session guitarist,<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|pp=386<U+2013>387}}</ref> was not originally supposed to play but was present as Wilson's guest.<ref name="Marcus104">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|p=104}}</ref> When Wilson stepped out, however, Kooper sat down with his guitar with the other musicians, hoping to take part in the recording session.<ref name=kooper>{{cite video | people=Kooper, Al|date=2005 |title=[[No Direction Home]]| medium=DVD |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]}}</ref> By the time Wilson returned, Kooper, who had been intimidated by Bloomfield's guitar playing, was back in the control room. After a couple of rehearsal takes, Wilson moved Griffin from [[Hammond organ]] to piano.<ref name=kooper/> Kooper then went to Wilson, saying that he had a good part for the organ. Wilson belittled Kooper's organ-playing abilities, but as Kooper later said, "He just sort of scoffed at me&nbsp;... He didn't say 'no'<U+2014>so I went out there." Wilson, surprised to see Kooper at the organ, nevertheless allowed him to play on the track. Upon hearing a playback of the song, Dylan insisted that the organ be turned up in the mix, despite Wilson's protestations that Kooper was "not an organ player."<ref name="Marcus111">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|pp=110<U+2013>111}}</ref>

This session saw 15 recorded takes.<ref name=irwin>{{harvnb|Irwin|2008|p=72}}</ref> The song had by now evolved into its familiar form, in 4/4 time with Dylan on electric guitar. After the fourth take<U+2014>the master take that was released as a single{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32, track 3}}<U+2014>Wilson happily commented, "That sounds good to me."<ref name="Marcusday2">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|pp=211<U+2013>225}}</ref> Nevertheless, Dylan and the band persisted in recording the song 11 more times.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=243}}</ref>

==Release==
According to Shaun Considine, release coordinator for [[Columbia Records]] in 1965, "Like a Rolling Stone" was first relegated to the "graveyard of canceled releases" because of concerns from the sales and marketing departments over its unprecedented six-minute length and "raucous" rock sound. In the days following the rejection, Considine took a discarded [[acetate disc|acetate]] of the song to a New York club called Arthur<U+2014>a newly opened disco popular with celebrities and media people.<ref name="CONSIDINE"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1999/7/1999_7_43.shtml |title=Disco |author=Braunstein, Peter |date=March 5, 1997 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |work=American Heritage |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100205223044/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1999/7/1999_7_43.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=February 5, 2010}}</ref> At the crowd's insistence, the demo was played over and over, until finally it wore out.

==Themes==
Unlike conventional chart hits of the time, the lyrics of "Like a Rolling Stone" were not about love, but expressed resentment and a yearning for revenge.<ref name=polizzotti1>{{harvnb|Polizzotti|2006|p=33}}</ref><ref name=trager2>{{harvnb|Trager|2004|pp=378<U+2013>379}}</ref> Author Oliver Trager describes the lyrics as "Dylan's sneer at a woman who has fallen from grace and is reduced to fending for herself in a hostile, unfamiliar world."<ref name=trager2/> Until now, the song's target, Miss Lonely, has taken the easy way out, gone to the finest schools and had high-placed friends, but now that her situation has become difficult she has no meaningful experiences on which to base her character.<ref name=trager2/> The opening lines of the song establish the woman's former condition:

:''Once upon a time you dressed so fine''
:''Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?''<ref name=lyrics>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan Lyrics 1962<U+2013>2001|author=Dylan, B.|pages=167<U+2013>168|year=2004|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-7432-2827-8}}</ref>

And the first verse ends with lines deriding her current condition:

:''Now you don't talk so loud''
:''Now you don't seem so proud''
:''About having to be scrounging your next meal''<ref name=lyrics/>

Despite the vitriol, the song also depicts compassion for Miss Lonely, as well as joy in the freedom of losing everything.<ref name=polizzotti1/> [[Jann Wenner]] has commented that "Everything has been stripped away. You're on your own, you're free now&nbsp;... You're so helpless and now you've got nothing left. And you're invisible<U+2014>you've got no secrets<U+2014>that's so liberating. You've nothing to fear anymore."<ref>{{harvnb|Polizzotti|2006|p=35}}</ref> The final verse ends with the lines:

:''When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose''
:''You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal''<ref name=lyrics/>

The [[refrain]] emphasizes these themes:

:''How does it feel''
:''How does it feel''
:''To be on your own''
:''With no direction home''
:''Like a complete unknown''
:''Like a rolling stone''<ref name=lyrics/>

Dylan biographer [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] summed up the song's meaning as: "A song that seems to hail the dropout life for those who can take it segues into compassion for those who have dropped out of bourgeois surroundings. 'Rolling Stone' is about the loss of innocence and the harshness of experience. Myths, props, and old beliefs fall away to reveal a very taxing reality."<ref name="Shelton 1986 279"/>

In a humorous vein, Dylan commented on the moral perspective of "Like a Rolling Stone" at a press conference at [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] television studio on December 3, 1965. A reporter suggested to Dylan the song took a hard line on a girl, and asked "Do you want to change their lives? or do you want to point out to them the error of their ways?" Laughing, Dylan replied, "I want to needle them."<ref>{{harvnb|Cott|2006|p=64}}</ref><ref>{{cite video | people=Dylan, Bob |date=2006

Commentators have tried to tie the characters in the song to specific people in Dylan's orbit in 1965. In his book ''[[Popism: The Warhol Sixties|POPism: The Warhol '60s]]'', [[Andy Warhol]] recalled that some people in his circle believed that "Like a Rolling Stone" contained hostile references to him; he was told, "Listen to 'Like a Rolling Stone'<U+2014>I think you're the diplomat on the chrome horse, man."<ref>{{harvnb|Warhol|1980|p=108}}</ref> The reason behind Dylan's alleged hostility to Warhol was supposedly Warhol's treatment of [[Edie Sedgwick]], an actress and model. Sedgwick has been suggested as the basis of the central character in the song, 'Miss Lonely'.<ref name="h2g2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A23814911 |title=No Direction Home<U+2014>the Life and Death of Edie Sedgwick|publisher=BBC |date=June 20, 2007 |accessdate=June 7, 2008}}</ref> Sedgwick was briefly involved with Dylan in late 1965 and early 1966, around which time there was some discussion of the two making a movie together.<ref name=stein>{{harvnb|Stein|1992|pp=283<U+2013>285}}</ref> According to Warhol collaborator [[Paul Morrissey]], Sedgwick may have been in love with Dylan, and was shocked when she found out that Dylan had secretly married [[Sara Lownds]] in November 1965.<ref name=stein/> However, in ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] argues that Sedgwick had no connection with "Like a Rolling Stone", but states "there's no doubt that the ghost of Edie Sedgwick hangs around ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]''".<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|pp=603<U+2013>604}}</ref>

[[Greil Marcus]] has alluded to a suggestion by art historian [[Thomas E. Crow|Thomas Crow]] that Dylan had written the song as a comment on Warhol's scene: "I heard a lecture by Thomas Crow&nbsp;... about "Like a Rolling Stone" being about Edie Sedgwick within Andy Warhol's circle, as something that Dylan saw from the outside, not being personally involved with either of them, but as something he saw and was scared by and saw disaster looming and wrote a song as a warning, and it was compelling."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/blog/j-gabriel-boylan/qa-greil-marcus-critic-scholar| title = The Q&A: Greil Marcus, Critic, Scholar| author = Boylan, J. Gabriel| date = April 20, 2010| accessdate = April 21, 2010|work= More Intelligent Life}}</ref> [[Joan Baez]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Bob Neuwirth]] have also been mooted as possible targets of Dylan's scorn.<ref name="My Back Pages"/><ref name=heylin09/><ref>{{harvnb|Williamson|2006|pp=226<U+2013>227}}</ref> Dylan's biographer [[Howard Sounes]] warned against reducing the song to the biography of one person, and suggested "it is more likely that the song was aimed generally at those [Dylan] perceived as being 'phony{{'"}}. Sounes adds, "There is some irony in the fact that one of the most famous songs of the [[folk-rock]] era<U+2014>an era associated primarily with ideals of peace and harmony<U+2014>is one of vengeance."<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|pp=178<U+2013>179}}</ref>

[[Mike Marqusee]] has written at length on the conflicts in Dylan's life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He suggests that the song is probably self-referential. "The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home.'"<ref>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2003|p=157}}</ref> Dylan himself has noted that after his motorcycle accident in 1966 he realized that "when I used words like 'he' and 'it' and 'they,' and talking about other people, I was really talking about nobody but me."<ref name=heylin09>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=241}}</ref>

Dylan performed the song live for the first time within days of its release, when he appeared at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] on July 25, 1965 in Newport, Rhode Island.<ref name="Newport uncut">{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/bob_dylan/special_features/8598 |title=Bob Dylan&nbsp;<U+2013> Like a Rolling Stone |work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref> Many of the audience's folk enthusiasts objected to [[Electric Dylan controversy|Dylan's use of electric guitars]], looking down on rock 'n roll, as Bloomfield put it, as popular amongst "greasers, heads, dancers, people who got drunk and boogied."<ref name="Guardian" /> According to Dylan's friend, music critic [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]], "The audience [was] booing and yelling 'Get rid of the electric guitar'", while Dylan and his backing musicians gave an uncertain rendition of their new single.<ref name="Guardian" />

''Highway 61 Revisited'' was issued at the end of August 1965. When Dylan went on tour that fall he asked the future members of [[The Band]] to accompany him in performing the electric half of the concerts. "Like a Rolling Stone" took the closing slot on his setlist and held it, with rare exceptions, through the end of his 1966 "world tour." On May 17, 1966, during the last leg of the tour, Dylan and his band performed at Free Trade Hall in [[Manchester, England]]. Just before they started to play the track, an audience member yelled "Judas!", apparently referring to Dylan's supposed "betrayal" of folk music. Dylan responded, "I don't believe you. You're a liar!" With that, he turned to the band, ordering them to "play it fucking loud."<ref name="Newport uncut" />

Since then, "Like a Rolling Stone" has remained a staple in Dylan's concerts, often with revised arrangements.<ref name=trager1>{{harvnb|Trager|2004|p=380}}</ref> It was included in his 1969 [[Isle of Wight]] show and in both his reunion tour with [[The Band]] in 1974 and the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] tour in 1975<U+2013>76. The song continued to be featured in other tours throughout the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=trager1/> On the [[Never Ending Tour]], which began in 1988, "Like a Rolling Stone" has been one of the five most performed songs, with 653 performances registered through 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Williamson|2006|p=162}}</ref>

Besides ''Highway 61 Revisited'', the song's standard release can be found on five official albums: ''[[Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits]]'',"[[Self Portrait]]", ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', ''[[The Essential Bob Dylan]]'', and ''[[Dylan (2007 album)|Dylan]]''. In addition, the early, incomplete studio recording in 3/4 time appears on ''The Bootleg Series Volumes 1<U+2013>3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961<U+2013>1991''.<ref name="Marcusday1" /><ref name="Home page">{{cite web|url=http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/rolling.html |title=Bob Dylan: Like a Rolling Stone |publisher=Columbia Records |accessdate=May 18, 2008}}</ref> Live performances of the song are included on ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]'', ''[[Before the Flood]]'', ''[[Bob Dylan at Budokan]]'', ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'', ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert]]'', ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'',<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/like-a-rolling-stone| title = Like A Rolling Stone| accessdate = May 24, 2010|work=BobDylan.com}}</ref> and The Band's ''[[Rock of Ages (album)|Rock of Ages]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://theband.hiof.no/albums/rock_of_ages.html

==Legacy==
The song's sound was revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan's voice, at once young and jeeringly cynical.<ref name = "Gray413">{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=413}}</ref> Critic [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] described the track as "a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense directness in the central chorus: 'How does it feel'".<ref name = "Gray413"/> The song had an enormous impact on popular culture and rock music. Its success made Dylan a pop icon, as [[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] notes:

{{quote|Dylan had been famous, had been the center of attention, for a long time. But now the ante was being upped again. He'd become a pop star as well as a folk star&nbsp;... and was, even more than the Beatles, a public symbol of the vast cultural, political, generational changes taking place in the United States and Europe. He was perceived as, and in many ways functioned as, a leader.<ref name="Performing artist">{{harvnb|Williams|1991|p=155}}</ref>}}

Record producer [[Paul Rothchild]], producer of [[The Doors]]' first five albums, recalled the elation that an American musician had made a record that successfully challenged the primacy of the [[British Invasion]] groups. He said, "What I realized when I was sitting there is that one of US<U+2014>one of the so-called [[Greenwich Village|Village]] hipsters<U+2014>was making music that could compete with THEM<U+2014>[[the Beatles]], and [[The Rolling Stones|the Stones]], and the [[Dave Clark Five]]<U+2014>without sacrificing any of the integrity of folk music or the power of rock'n'roll."<ref>{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|pp=144<U+2013>145}}</ref>

The song had a huge impact on [[Bruce Springsteen]], who was 15 years old when he first heard it. Springsteen described the moment during his speech inducting Dylan into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and also assessed the long-term significance of "Like a Rolling Stone":

{{quote|The first time I heard Bob Dylan, I was in the car with my mother listening to [[WMCA]], and on came that snare shot that sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind&nbsp;... The way that Elvis freed your body, Dylan freed your mind, and showed us that because the music was physical did not mean it was anti-intellect. He had the vision and talent to make a pop song so that it contained the whole world. He invented a new way a pop singer could sound, broke through the limitations of what a recording could achieve, and he changed the face of rock'n'roll for ever and ever "<ref name="Bruce springsteen">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1197784,00.html |title=Bob Dylan at 65 |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=May 24, 2006 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=May 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bauldie|1992|pp=191<U+2013>192}}</ref>}}

Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 were both startled and challenged by the single. [[Paul McCartney]] remembered going around to [[John Lennon]]'s house in [[Weybridge]] to hear the song. According to McCartney, "It seemed to go on and on forever. It was just beautiful&nbsp;... He showed all of us that it was possible to go a little further."<ref name="Heylin205">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|p=205}}</ref> [[Frank Zappa]] had a more extreme reaction: "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else&nbsp;...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have."<ref name="Heylin205"/> Nearly forty years later, in 2003, [[Elvis Costello]] commented on the innovative quality of the single. "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Supremes]] and [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Elvis |last=Costello |title=What I've Learned |journal=Esquire |date=September 2003}}</ref>

Although CBS tried to make the record more "radio friendly" by cutting it in half and spreading it over both sides of the vinyl, both Dylan and fans demanded that the full duration of the recording should be placed on one side and that radio stations play the song in its entirety.<ref name="Crossroads p145.">{{harvnb|Marcus|2005 (1)|p=145}}</ref> "Like a Rolling Stone"'s success was influential in changing the music business convention regarding the length of singles, whereby they were restricted to durations of less than three minutes. In the words of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, "No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time."<ref>''Rolling Stone'', page 66, issue number 963, December 9, 2004</ref> Richard Austin, of [[Sotheby's]] auction house, said: "Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone, music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs, many clocking in at three minutes or less. By defying convention with six and a half minutes of dark, brooding poetry, Dylan rewrote the rules for pop music."<ref name="Sale" />

In 1966, Dylan told [[Ralph Gleason]]: "'Rolling Stone<nowiki>'</nowiki>s the best song I wrote."<ref>"The Children's Crusade" by Ralph Gleason, reprinted in {{harvnb|McGregor|1972|p=187}}</ref> In 2004, speaking to [[Robert Hilburn]], Dylan still felt that the song had a special place in his work: "It's like a ghost is writing a song like that, it gives you the song and it goes away. You don't know what it means. Except that the ghost picked me to write the song."<ref>Hilburn, Robert, "How To Write Songs and Influence People" (interview from 2004), ''Guitar World Acoustic'', February 2006, quoted in {{harvnb|Polizzotti|2006|pp=32<U+2013>33}}</ref>

More than 40 years since its release, "Like a Rolling Stone" remains highly regarded, as measured by polls of reviewers and fellow songwriters. A 2002 ranking by ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' and a 2005 poll in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' both rated it as Dylan's number one song.<ref>{{cite web |title=Uncut&nbsp;<U+2013> Top 40 Dylan Tracks|work=Uncut |date=June 2002 |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/uncut.htm#Dylan |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Mojo">{{cite web |title=100 Greatest Dylan Songs|work=Mojo |date=November 2005|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mojo_p4.htm#Bob%20Dylan%20Songs |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> As for his personal views on such polls, Dylan told [[Ed Bradley]] in a 2004 interview on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that he never pays attention to them, because they change frequently.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Dylan Looks Back|series=60 Minutes|serieslink=60 Minutes|airdate=December 5, 2004}}</ref> Dylan's point was illustrated in the "100 Greatest Songs of All Time poll" by ''Mojo'' in 2000, which included two Dylan singles, but not "Like a Rolling Stone".

Hendrix played the electric guitar, and music critic [[Greil Marcus]] described the atmosphere of the Hendrix recording thus:
