The '''bluespotted stingray''' (''Neotrygon kuhlii'') or '''Kuhl's stingray''', is a [[species]] of [[stingray]] of the [[Dasyatidae]] family. It is light green with blue spots. Its disk width hovers around {{convert|42|cm|sp=us}}. It is popular in aquaria but usually not distinguished from the [[bluespotted ribbontail ray]]. The ribbontail is rounder with brighter green and more vivid spots, but the bluespotted stingray is larger.<ref>{{Harv|Randall|2005|p=18}}</ref> The stingray's maximum age estimate is from one to eighteen years of age. The bluespotted stingray preys on many fish and small mollusks, but is also preyed on by the killer whale and hammer head shark.<ref>{{Citation| last = Jacobsen| first = IP | last2 = Bennett | first2 = MB| title = Age and growth of Neotrygon picta, Neotrygon annotata and Neotrygon kuhlii from north-east Australia, with notes on their reproductive biology.| journal = Journal of Fish Biology| date = December 20, 2011 | origyear = 2010| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21155791}}</ref> The bluespotted stingray is also generally found in Indonesia to Japan, and south to Northern Australia. The bluespotted stingray is also targeted by many parasites such as tapeworms, flatworms, and flukes.

==Taxonomy==
The bluespotted stingray was discovered by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, there are two different subgroups: the Java and Bali form.<ref name=IUCNNR>{{cite web|title=Neotrygon kuhlii|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources|year=2007|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/161590/0|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java.<ref name= fishbase /> On the [[familial]] level, the ''Dasyatidae'' family is made up of 9 [[genera]] and 70 [[species]]. The genus of [[neotrygon]] means mask, named because of the color pattern around their eyes.  The largest species of this family can grow up to {{convert|4|m|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stingrays (Dasyatidae)|publisher= WILD Fact Sheets| date=February 11, 2008 |url=http://www.wildsingapore.com/wildfacts/vertebrates/fish/dasyatidae/dasyatidae.htm|accessdate=December 24, 2011}}</ref>

==Description and behavior==
[[File:Bluespot stingray.jpg|thumb|left|The full body of a bluespotted stingray, showing the black and white striped tail.]]
The bluespotted stingray has a flat disc-like oval body in about {{convert|42|cm|sp=us}} in diameter and {{convert|70|cm|sp=us}} in length;<ref>{{cite web|title=Species Fact Sheet-- Rays|publisher=  Shark Bay Ecosystem Research Project |url= http://www2.fiu.edu/~heithaus/SBERP/pdfs/species/raysfs.pdf |accessdate= December 18, 2011}}</ref> and their coloring is a dark green with blue spots with a light white underbelly also known as [[countershading]]. The bluespotted stingray's snout is very short and broadly angular along with its angular disc.<ref name= fishbase /> The rays' bright coloration serves as a warning for its venomous spines. The ray has a very long tail accommodating two venomous spines on the base of the tail. The tail is about twice as long as the body of the ray, and the barbs or spines are two different sizes, one being very large and the other a medium-sized barb. The bluespotted stingray has bright yellow eyes, and the eyes are positioned to allow them a wide angle of view. The [[spiracles]], which allow them to breathe, are located directly behind the ray's eyes. The ray's gills and mouth are found on the underside of the body.<ref name=Shedd>{{cite web|title=Blue Spot Stingray|publisher= John G. Shedd Aquarium |url= http://sea.sheddaquarium.org/sea/fact_sheets.asp?id=109#|accessdate= December 18, 2011}}</ref> The ray normally lives alone or in small groups. One unique characteristic of the bluespotted stingray is that they rarely bury themselves in the sand only to hide from predators, unlike the majority of rays who bury themselves regularly.<ref name=Shedd />

[[File:Shrimp.jpg|thumb|Shrimp, a bluespotted stingray's main food source.]]

===Diet===
This type of ray feeds on shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, crabs and other worms. Due to the fact that this ray is a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them to the bottom of the seafloor with its fins. This ray does not have teeth, instead it has food-crushing plates on the sides of its mouth.<ref name=Shedd />

===Reproduction===
The bluespotted stingray is [[ovoviviparous]]. The embryos are retained in eggs within the mother's body in eggs until they are ready to be hatched the babies receive nourishment from the mothers' uterine fluid. Mothers give birth to up to seven pups per liter, these pups range from {{convert|6|in|sp=us}} to {{convert|13|in|sp=us}} long at birth.<ref name=Bester>{{Cite web | last = Bester | first = Cathleen | title = Blue Spotted Stingray | publisher = Ichthyology Department, Florida Museum of Natural History |date = November 11, 2011| url = http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/gallery/Descript/bluespottedsray/bluespottedsray.html}}</ref> The bluspotted stingray passes its offspring 32 sets of chromosomes.<ref name= fishbase /> The mother also has a annual reproductive cycle. Studies show that the mating season is in October and November and the ovulating season is in the Australian summer (December 1- February 28/29), which coincides with the embryonic development.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pierce,Pardo,Bennett|first=S.J.,S.A.,M.B.|title=Reproduction of the blue-spotted maskray Neotrygon kuhlii (Myliobatoidei: Dasyatidae) in south-east Queensland, Australia|publisher=Journal of Fish Biology|date=December 10, 2011|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02202.x/abstract}}</ref>

==Habitat==
[[File:Bluespotted range map.png|thumb|Bluespotted stingray range map.]]
The bluespotted stingray is commonly found in waters of depths about 0<U+2013>90 meters (0<U+2013>295&nbsp;feet), being found near rocky [[coral reefs]]. This stingray is found in a tropical climate at 29<U+00B0>N- 31<U+00B0>S, and 20<U+00B0>E- 171<U+00B0>W.<ref name= fishbase>{{cite web|title= Neotrygon kuhlii- Blue-spotted stingray (M<U+00FC>ller & Henle, 1841)|publisher= FishBase|year=2010|accessdate= December 30, 2011|url= http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/speciesSummary.php?ID=4508&genusname=Neotrygon&speciesname=kuhlii}}</ref> At high tide the bluespotted stingray moves out into the shallow lagoons and reef flats.<ref name=IUCNNR /> It is found in northern [[Australia]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], The island of [[Mauritius]], [[Somalia]], the east coast of [[South Africa]], [[India]]. The bluespotted stingray is in almost the entire continental waters of [[Asia]], including the [[Sea of Japan]], [[Yellow Sea]], [[East China Sea]], [[Philippine Sea]], [[Sulu Sea]], [[Java Sea]], [[Banda Sea]], [[Celebes Sea]], [[Andaman Sea]], the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Neotrygon kuhlii (M<U+00FC>ller & Henle, 1841)|publisher= World Register of Marine Species|year=2009|url= http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=398330}}</ref>

==Threats and protected areas==
In Queensland, Australia there are many areas for high protection of the bluespotted stingray, three being the Shoalwater, [[Corio Bay]]'s Area Ramsar Site, and the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]].  A major threat of the bluespotted stingray is the destruction of [[coral reefs]] mainly in the Western Pacific. The rays dwell in these reefs and the destruction and pollution from fertilizers and pesticides hurt them.<ref name=Shedd /> The ray is commonly caught in the Java Sea by fisherman [[trawling]] and by [[Danish seine]] boats in large quantities. The bluespotted stingray is the second most significant species out of the sharks, rays, and skate family to be fished, contributiong to about {{convert|700|kg|sp=us}} per boat in 2006-2007.<ref name=IUNC>{{Cite web| title = Neotrygon kuhlii (Bluespotted Stingray) | publisher = IUNC Red List |date = December 20, 2011| url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/161590/0}}</ref>
[[File:Killerwhales jumping.jpg|thumb|Killer whales are the bluespotted stingray's main predator.]]

==Predators==
The [[hammerhead shark]] is the commonly known predator of the bluespotted stingray. Also the [[killer whale]] is a huge threat to these rays, generally preying on the more juvenile rays. The rays coloration is a warning for the highly poisonous barbs, so many animals do not attempt to overpower this ray.<ref name=Bester /><ref>{{Cite web| title = Predator Summary&nbsp;<U+2014> Neotrygon Kuhlii|author = Pablico, Grace Tolentino| publisher = FishBase|date = June 23, 2006|accessdate= December 27, 2011 |url =http://www.fishbase.tw/TrophicEco/PredatorSummary.php?vpredatstage=juv.%2Fadults&genusname=Neotrygon&speciesname=kuhlii&vstockcode=5631&vpreystage=juv.%2Fadults&vpredatorgroup=Delphinidae&vpredatorname=Orcinus+orca }}</ref> The hammerhead shark uses its head to pin down the bluespotted stingray, while it is in shock and much weaker.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Hammerhead Shark|publisher = Aquatic Community|year = 2006|accessdate= December 31, 2011 |url =http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/sharkfish/hammerheadshark.php}}</ref> When a killer whale encounters a stingray they dig them up from the sand that they are nestled into, then launch them into the air. Also, they may use [[tonic immobility]] on rays by the whale turning upside down before it attacks, then bite the ray while upside down and then flips over putting the stingray belly up and the ray entering tonic immobility.<ref>{{cite video | people =  | title = How Whales Eat Sharks | medium = television production| publisher = National Geographic TV| date = December 31, 2011}}</ref>

==Human interaction==
Due to the unique characteristics of this ray it is very common to be found in [[pet trade]], many people ignore the fact that in total maturity the size of the ray exceeds the capacity of many household aquariums.<ref name=Shedd /> The bluespotted stingray is generally fished for its meat, being either smoked and salted or dried for local markets.<ref name=IUNC /> It is caught in mass in [[bottom trawl]], [[trammel]], and fish traps. It is fished for its meat, but inexpensive due to small size.<ref name= fishbase /> The bluespotted stingray is very venomous and it has a barb approximately {{convert|12|in|sp=us}} long.  The venom contains serotonin, 5' nucleotidase, and phosphodiesterase.<ref>{{Cite web | last= Auerbach, M.D.| first = Paul S.| title = The Tragic Death of Steve Irwin | publisher = Divers Alert Network|date = April 20, 2009| accessdate= December 31, 2011| url = http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/default.aspx?a=news&id=845}}</ref>
