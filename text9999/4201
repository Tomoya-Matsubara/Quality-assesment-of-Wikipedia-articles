'''''Sanicula purpurea''''' is a rare species of flowering plant in the [[Apiaceae|carrot family]] known by the common names '''purpleflower black-snakeroot''' and '''purple-flowered sanicle'''. It is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Hawaii]], where it is known from [[Maui]] and from the [[Koolau Range|Koolau Mountains]] on the island of [[Oahu]].<ref name=tnc>[http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Sanicula+purpurea ''Sanicula purpurea''.] The Nature Conservancy.</ref> It is threatened by the degradation of its habitat. It was federally listed as [[endangered species]] of the United States in 1996.<ref name=fed>USFWS. [http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/federal_register/fr3011.pdf Determination of Endangered or Threatened Status for Fourteen Plant Taxa From the Hawaiian Islands.] ''Federal Register'' October 10, 1996.</ref>

This plant has a short, thick stem growing up to about 36 centimeters in maximum height. The leaves have leathery blades measuring up to 8 centimeters long. They are heart-shaped or kidney-shaped and are divided into several large lobes. The [[inflorescence]] is a cluster of flowers at the top of the stem. Each cluster has up to three bisexual flowers and up to seven male flowers with nonfunctioning female parts. The flowers have purple petals, making it easy to identify among the sanicles present in Hawaii.<ref name=fed/>

This plant grows in [[bog]]gy habitat among other plants such as ''[[Argyroxiphium grayanum]]'' and ''[[Oreobolus furcatus]]''.<ref name=fed/>

By 1996 there was only one population remaining on Oahu, and possibly another, but the latter had not been seen in years. On Maui there were three populations. The total global population of the plant was estimated to be no more than 210 individuals.<ref name=fed/>

Threats to the species include damage to the habitat by [[feral pig]]s and the presence of the [[introduced species|non-native]] [[Axonopus fissifolius|narrow-leaved carpetgrass]] (''Axonopus fissifolius'').<ref name=fed/>
