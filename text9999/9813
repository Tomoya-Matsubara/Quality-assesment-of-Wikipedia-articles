==Earthquake==
[[File:Map of Sendai Earthquake 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|right|275px|Map of the Sendai earthquake and aftershocks]]

The main earthquake was preceded by a number of large [[foreshock]]s, beginning with a 7.2&nbsp;M<sub>W</sub> event on 9&nbsp;March approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from 11 March quake, and followed by another three on the same day in excess of 6&nbsp;M<sub>W</sub> in magnitude.<ref name="USGS1" /> One minute prior to the effects of the earthquake being felt in [[Tokyo]], the [[Earthquake Early Warning (Japan)|Earthquake Early Warning]] system connected to more than 1,000 [[seismometer]]s in Japan sent out warnings on television of an impending earthquake to millions. This was possible because the damaging seismic [[S-wave]]s, traveling at 4 kilometers per second, took about 90 seconds to travel the {{convert|373|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} to Tokyo.

On 13 March 2011, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) published details of tsunami observations recorded around the coastline of Japan following the earthquake. These observations included tsunami maximum readings of over {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} at the following locations and times on 11 March 2011, following the earthquake at 14:46 JST:<ref>[http://www.jma.go.jp/en/tsunami/observation_04_20110313180559.html Tsunami Information NUMBER 64 (Tsunami Observation)], Japan Meteorological Agency, issued 18:05 JST 13 Mar 2011, accessed 14/03/2011.

These readings were obtained from recording stations maintained by the JMA around the coastline of Japan. Many areas were also affected by tsunamis of {{convert|1|to|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in height, and the JMA bulletin also included the caveat that ''"At some parts of the coasts, tsunamis may be higher than those observed at the observation sites."'' The timing of the earliest recorded tsunami maximum readings ranged from 15:12 to 15:21, between 26 and 35 minutes after the earthquake had struck.

The rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima later had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10<U+2013>20 minute intervals (normally 3<U+2013>5 minutes), operating some lines only at rush hour, and completely shutting down others (notably, the [[Tokaido Main Line]], [[Yokosuka Line]], [[Sobu Main Line]] and [[Chuo-Sobu Line]] were all stopped for the day).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0314/TKY201103130323.html |title=asahi.com<U+FF08><U+671D><U+65E5><U+65B0><U+805E><U+793E><U+FF09><U+FF1A><U+8A08><U+753B><U+505C><U+96FB><U+3067><U+5F71><U+97FF><U+304C><U+51FA><U+308B><U+4E3B><U+306A><U+9244><U+9053><U+FF08><U+5348><U+524D><U+FF17><U+6642><U+73FE><U+5728><U+FF09> <U+2013> <U+793E><U+4F1A> |publisher=Asahi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref> This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home.

The [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships]] were scheduled to take place from 21<U+2013>27 March at the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]] in [[Tokyo]] but the [[International Skating Union]] decided on 14 March to postpone the event, after the German team announced that it would follow recommendations not to travel to Japan.<ref name=asspressmarch13>{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2011-03-13-skating-worlds-japan_N.htm | title = Germany pulls out of skating worlds in Japan | date = 13 March 2011 | agency = Associated Press | publisher = usatoday.com | accessdate = 13 March 2011}}</ref> International Skating Union President [[Ottavio Cinquanta]] published a statement on the federation website on March 15, confirming the cancellation of the event.

Also on hold is the ISU Figure Skating World Team Trophy, scheduled for [[Yokohama]] on April 14<U+2013>17. The ISU is waiting for guidance from Japanese authorities on whether the skating championships can be held. "It is understood that a postponement of the above-mentioned World Championships as well as the holding of the ISU World Team Trophy is subject to the confirmation by the competent Japanese authorities that the situation is back to normal conditions allowing the safe conduct of major ISU sports Events in the Tokyo area," says the ISU.<ref>[http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=36603] Around the Rings</ref>

Some economic analysts consider that, ultimately, the catastrophe will improve Japan's economy, with increased job availability during restoration efforts.

An analyst at [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale]] anticipated that Japan's economy will decline in March but will revive powerfully in subsequent months.

Kan promised his 100% cooperation in alleviating the situation. He declared that "the safety of Japan's citizens is the priority, and to save every possible life is his current mission." He added that the defense force, police, rescue crew and individuals are currently working at full potential to mediate the situation, and called for more help from all over Japan. Evacuation shelters currently are facing a shortage of potable water, food, blankets and bathroom facilities, as the government arranges these necessities to be delivered to where they are needed as soon as possible, from various areas of Japan and abroad.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Dropping temperatures due to the disruption in electrical and gas lines caused further problems at shelters.<ref name="nhk-english-stream" />

===International response===

Japan received messages of condolence and offers of assistance from a range of international leaders. According to the [[United Nations]], search and rescue teams from 45 countries had been offered to Japan.

The Fukushima incident brought the issue of nuclear power to the fore internationally, causing an anti-nuclear demonstration of 50,000 people in [[Stuttgart]] and the cancellation of a pro-nuclear press conference in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/nuclear-power-comes-under-attack-solar-stocks-increase_100002437/|title=Nuclear power comes under attack; solar stocks increase|last=Stuart|first=Becky|date=14 March 2011|work=pv magazine|accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>

===Media coverage===
Japan's national public broadcaster, [[NHK]], and [[JSTV|Japan Satellite Television]] suspended their usual programming to provide ongoing coverage of the situation.<ref>[[NHK]] News, 14:40 JST.</ref> Various other nationwide Japanese TV networks also broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the disaster. [[Ustream.tv|Ustream Asia]] broadcast live feeds of NHK, [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], [[TV Kanagawa]], and [[CNN]] on the Internet starting on 12 March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://internet.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20110312_432721.html |title=Ustream Asia<U+3001><U+6C11><U+653E>TV<U+5404><U+5C40><U+306E><U+6771><U+5317><U+5730><U+65B9><U+592A><U+5E73><U+6D0B><U+6C96><U+5730><U+9707><U+5831><U+9053><U+756A><U+7D44><U+3092><U+540C><U+6642><U+914D><U+4FE1> -INTERNET Watch}}</ref>

On 14 March, NHK News reported a [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] warning that there was a 70% probability of a new earthquake exceeding magnitude 7.0 occurring within or near the same hypocentral region in the following three days.<ref>[[NHK]] News, 03:30 JST.</ref>

===Scientific and research response ===
According to the chief scientist for the Multi-Hazards project at the [[U.S. Geological Survey]], the fact that the Sendai earthquake took place in Japan <U+2013> a country with "the best seismic information in the world" <U+2013> meant that for the first time it was hoped that data had been collected that would allow modeling of an earthquake of this type and severity in great detail. Andreas Reitbrock, a professor of seismology at the [[University of Liverpool]], agreed, stating that "It gives us, for the first time, the possibility to model in great detail what happened during the rupture of an earthquake." <ref name="Deutsche Welle" /> 

The effect of this data is expected to be felt across other disciplines as well. Tom Heaton, a seismological engineer, commented that "the tragedy would provide unprecedented information about how buildings hold up under long periods of shaking <U+2014> and thus how to build them better. We had very little information about that before now". <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-sci-japan-quake-science-20110313,0,5782113.story|title=Japan earthquake shifted Earth on its axis|last=Brown|first=Eryn|date=12 March 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x96cBq8d|archivedate=13 March 2011}}</ref>
