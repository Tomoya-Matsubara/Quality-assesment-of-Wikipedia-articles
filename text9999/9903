'''Albert Charles "Babe" Siebert''' (January 14, 1904 <U+2013> August 25, 1939) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|left winger]] and [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] who played 14 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the  [[Montreal Maroons]], [[New York Rangers]], [[Boston Bruins]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]].  He won the 1926 [[Stanley Cup]] championship with the Maroons, and was a member of the famous "[[S Line]]",  and another with the Rangers in 1933.

A physical forward known for his [[Fighting in ice hockey|fighting]] ability while with the Maroons and Rangers, an apparent decline in his play was reversed when he switched to defence after he was traded to the Bruins. Siebert was named an [[NHL All-Star Team|all-star]] three times after the switch and won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophy]] as the NHL's most valuable player in 1937 as a member of the Canadiens.

Siebert was named the [[List of Montreal Canadiens head coaches|head coach of the Canadiens]] upon his retirement as a player in 1939.  He never coached a game as he drowned in [[Lake Huron]] prior to the [[1939<U+2013>40 NHL season]].  The league organized an [[NHL All-Star Game|all-star benefit game]] that raised $15,000 for Siebert's family.  He was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1964.

==Early life==
Born in [[Plattsville, Ontario]], Siebert grew up in the nearby community of [[Zurich, Ontario|Zurich]], located on the eastern shores of [[Lake Huron]].<ref name="LOH1on1">{{cite web |last=Shea |first=Kevin |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononep196403.htm |title=One-on-one with Babe Siebert |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |date=2002-02-29 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> He became obsessed with hockey at an early age, playing the game nearly every day.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers">{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Players: The ultimate A<U+2013>Z guide of everyone who has ever played in the NHL |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2003 |location=Toronto |id=ISBN 0-385-25999-9 |pages=787<U+2013>788}}</ref> He played intermediate hockey in Zurich and [[Exeter, Ontario|Exeter]] before moving to [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] to play junior hockey.<ref name="LOHStats">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196403&type=Player&page=bio&list=ByName#photo |title=Babe Siebert statistics |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref>  Though his elder brothers mocked his simple playing style&mdash;he used his size and strength to push his way through opponents&mdash;Siebert was invited to join the [[Kitchener Greenshirts]] in 1922.<ref name="HockeyHeroes">{{cite book |last=Leonetti |first=Mike |last2=Beliveau |first2=Jean |title=Canadiens Legends: Montreal's Hockey Heroes |publisher=Raincoast Books |year=2003 |id=ISBN 1-55192-731-4 |page=36}}</ref>  He won the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) and eastern Canadian junior championships with Kitchener in 1922<U+2013>23, but lost the [[Memorial Cup]] [[1923 Memorial Cup|final]] to the [[University of Manitoba]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lapp |first1=Richard |last2=Macaulay |first2=Alec |title=The Memorial Cup |publisher=Harbour Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-55017-170-4 |page=22}}</ref>  After a year of senior hockey in Kitchener, he moved on to the [[Niagara Falls Cataracts]], winning the OHA senior championship in 1924<U+2013>25.<ref>{{cite news |title=Allan Cup hockey is well under way |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=1925-03-05 |page=12}}</ref>

==Professional career==
Siebert was signed by the [[Montreal Maroons]] in 1925 and made his professional debut that same year. He finished second on the team with 16 goals as the Maroons finished second in the NHL standings.<ref name="LOH1on1" />  Montreal defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] in the playoffs to win the NHL championship.<ref name="LOHBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196403&type=Player&page=bio&list=ByName#photo |title=Babe Siebert biography |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> Siebert scored three points in the [[1926 Stanley Cup Final]] as the Maroons defeated the [[Western Canada Hockey League|Western Hockey League]] champion [[Victoria Cougars]] to win the [[Stanley Cup]].<ref name="LOH1on1" />

When [[Hooley Smith]] arrived in Montreal in [[1926<U+2013>27 NHL season|1926<U+2013>27]], Siebert was paired with Smith and [[Nels Stewart]].<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />  The trio were known as the "[[S Line]]" and emerged as one of the top scoring lines in the NHL.<ref name="LOHBio" />  Stewart was the goal scorer on the line while Smith set him up with his passing game, but it was Siebert who used his strength and speed to move the puck out of their defensive zone and to create space for his line mates.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" /> His physical style of play occasionally resulted in Siebert being brought in front of league president [[Frank Calder]] for supplementary discipline, as in December 1927 when he was suspended for a time following a violent melee with [[Billy Boucher]] of the [[New York Americans]].  When Boucher responded to an elbow by slashing Siebert over the head, the latter player responded with repeated wild swings of his own stick at Boucher, injuring him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=-P0tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JIwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6544,4100912 |title=Maroons scored second straight over Americans |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1927-12-26 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=14}}</ref>

Siebert's best offensive season came in [[1931<U+2013>32 NHL season|1931<U+2013>32]] when he finished eighth in league scoring with 39 points. It proved to be his last season with the Maroons, as the team was struggling financially and chose to sell him to the [[New York Rangers]] for cash.<ref name="LOH1on1" />   He went on to win his second Stanley Cup that year.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" /> He struggled offensively for much of the season, however, and it was rumoured he would be traded.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=xCIyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=V6gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4290,1448977 |title=Babe Siebert may go |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1933-10-12 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=13}}</ref>  The trade finally happened early in the [[1933<U+2013>34 NHL season|1933<U+2013>34 season]] as he was sent to the [[Boston Bruins]] in exchange for [[Vic Ripley]] and [[Roy Burmeister]].  The deal reunited Siebert with former S Line member Nels Stewart.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=eUowAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4285,2402118 |title=Babe Siebert goes to Boston Bruins |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1933-12-19 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=12}}</ref> 

After [[Eddie Shore]] was suspended for his assault on [[Ace Bailey]], Bruins coach [[Art Ross]] shifted Siebert from left wing to defence.<ref name="FarewellDutchman" />  The switch rejuvenated his career; he enjoyed a comeback season in [[1934<U+2013>35 NHL season|1934<U+2013>35]].  Frequently remaining on the ice for entire games as one of Boston's key players, Siebert earned five votes in a 1935 [[Associated Press]] poll naming the top comeback player in sport for that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=8L4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C5kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3944,2065709 |title=Rugged 'Babe' Siebert captures five votes |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1935-12-20 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=15}}</ref> He later scoffed at the legend of his comeback in Boston, stating that he never lost his ability to play at the same level he did with the Maroons, instead blaming [[Lester Patrick]] for improperly utilizing him in New York.<ref name="FarewellDutchman" />

While Shore and Siebert were an effective pairing on defence, tensions between the two were evident. They shared a violent feud when they were opponents, and never spoke a word to the other as teammates.<ref name="LOH1on1" /> Though he was named a [[NHL All-Star Team|first team all-star]] in [[1935<U+2013>36 NHL season|1935<U+2013>36]],<ref name="LOHStats" /> the Bruins decided Siebert's career was in declnie and chose to trade him to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] along with [[Roger Jenkins]] in exchange for [[Leroy Goldsworthy]], [[Sammy McManus]] and cash following the season.<ref name="LOH1on1" />  He was immediately named the team's captain, a position he retained until his retirement.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kay |first=Jason (ed.) |year=2009 |title=A Century of Montreal Canadiens |periodical=The Hockey News |issn=0018-3016 |pages=63<U+2013>66}}</ref>  In his [[1936<U+2013>37 NHL season|first season]] with the Canadiens, Siebert earned his second all-star selection and won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophy]] as the most valuable player in the NHL.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=Gi8rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qZgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7009,1963386 |title=Babe Siebert gets Hart Trophy; Lady Byng Award is given Barry |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1937-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=15}}</ref> He earned his third consecutive all-star selection in [[1937<U+2013>38 NHL season|1937<U+2013>38]].<ref name="LOHStats" /> Plagued by injuries in his final season,<ref name="GazetteDrowned">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=wL8tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H5kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6477%2C4075576 |title=Babe Siebert, of Canadiens, drowned at 35 |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1939-08-26 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |pages=1, 16}}</ref> Siebert announced his retirement in 1939 to become the head coach of the Canadiens.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=pnotAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7JgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5951,1839120 |title=Babe Siebert is named as coach of Canadiens |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1939-06-10 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=11}}</ref>

==Death and family==
Siebert never had the opportunity to take up his new post.  On August 25, 1939, while vacationing with his family and swimming with his daughters at [[Lake Huron]], he drowned attempting to retrieve an inflatable tire they were playing with.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" /> Shocked by the news, Siebert's peers lauded his character and play, indicating that his death was a considerable loss to the game of hockey. Among them, his former manager with the Maroons, [[Tommy Gorman]], remarked that Siebert was popular with his fellow players and was a great defenceman who "lost fairly and won modestly".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=wL8tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H5kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4183,4201128 |title=Hockey world shocked by death of Babe Siebert, coach of Canadiens |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1939-08-26 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=16}}</ref> 

At the time of his death, Siebert was visiting his cottage to celebrate the 80th birthday of his father, William. He cherished the time he had with his two daughters Judy and Joan, who were 11 and 10 years old respectively, when they witnessed his drowning.<ref name="FarewellDutchman">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=wL8tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H5kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4183,4201128 |title=Farewell to the Flying Dutchman |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1939-08-26 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |pages=16, 18}}</ref>  His loss represented a significant financial burden for his family as he spent nearly all of his income paying for his wife's medical costs.<ref name="LOHBio" /> 

The league organized an all-star benefit game to aid Siebert's widow with the goal of raising $15,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=nr4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rZgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5279,3314772 |title=Siebert benefit plans advance; Trainer Bill O'Brien offers aid |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1939-10-13 |accessdate=2010-07-11 |page=16}}</ref>  It was the third such benefit game in NHL history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/11289847 |title=All-Star Games in Montreal |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>  The Montreal Canadiens faced an all-star team comprised of the best players from the remaining teams.  The all-stars defeated the Canadiens 5<U+2013>2 in the game held on October 29, 1939.<ref name="LOH1on1" />  Though organizers were disappointed with the attendance of just 6,000 fans, they met their $15,000 target.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />

A physical player and [[fighting in ice hockey|fighter]] on the ice, Siebert was a soft spoken family man off it.<ref name="HockeyHeroes" /> He was especially faithful to his wife, Bernice, who was left a paraplegic following complications during the birth of their second child.  Fans at the [[Montreal Forum]] routinely saw him carry his wife to her seat before every home game, and then carry her out after.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />  At home, he did the housework that his wife was unable to do.<ref name="GazetteDrowned" /> As a result, he was immensely popular with his peers and fans.<ref name="LOHBio" /><ref name="GazetteDrowned" />

Siebert was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1964,<ref name="LOHBio" /> and is an honoured member of the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo Region]] Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/web/region.nsf/97dfc347666efede85256e590071a3d4/D22EE171F2AA335185256B0A004D7B4C?OpenDocument |title=Waterloo Region Hall of Fame - Inductees S-V |publisher=Region of Waterloo |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>
