'''Sarc<U+00F3>fago''' was an influential [[Brazil]]ian [[extreme metal]] band. They were fronted by [[Sepultura]]'s original singer, [[Wagner Lamounier]], and Geraldo Minelli. They have been described as Brazil's most controversial [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band, and have frequently evoked polarized reactions among the metal scene.

The front cover of the band's debut album, ''[[I.N.R.I. (album)|I.N.R.I.]]'', is regarded as the single greatest influence on [[black metal]]'s image, especially over the [[corpse paint]] style make-up. That record is also considered one of the "[[Black metal#The First Wave|first wave]]" albums that helped shape the genre. Their third [[long play|LP]], ''[[The Laws of Scourge]]'', was one of the first [[technical death metal]] records to be released.

The band broke up in 2000, after releasing the ''Crust'' [[Extended play|EP]]. Former members, minus Wagner, have played throughout Brazil in 2006 under the moniker "Tributo ao Sarc<U+00F3>fago". In 2009 rumors surfaced that the original ''I.N.R.I.'' line-up were reuniting for a small, high-profile tour, but they proved to be false.

Sarc<U+00F3>fago's vinyl debut was on the [[Cogumelo Records|Cogumelo Produ<U+00E7><U+00F5>es]] [[split album]] ''Warfare Noise'', originally released in 1986. Sarc<U+00F3>fago contributed the three tracks "Recrucify", "The Black Vomit" and "Satanas".

After the release of ''I.N.R.I.'', Sarc<U+00F3>fago briefly disbanded. Lamounier moved to [[Uberl<U+00E2>ndia]] to study [[economics]] on the [[Federal University of Uberl<U+00E2>ndia]]&nbsp;(UFU), while Butcher and his brother D.D.

===''Rotting'' (1989<U+2013>1990)===
When ''[[Rotting (album)|Rotting]]'' first came out it stirred a huge amount of controversy due to its cover art&nbsp;<U+2014> a traditional [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]] figure licking what appears to be [[Jesus Christ]]'s face.<ref name= dynamte1359>Nemitz, 1994, p. 59.</ref> It was based upon a medieval painting. The [[Cover art|cover artist]] himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a [[crown of thorns]] over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.<ref name= manuval>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/arquivovalhalla/074819-sarcofago.html|title= Tributo ao Sarc<U+00F3>fago: a lenda vive|author= Tomasi, Eliton|date= 2008-07-07|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2009-01-27}}</ref>

''Rotting'' musically differs from the raw, hyper-speed black metal of ''I.N.R.I.'' Session drummer "Joker" brought a different set of influences to the band (such as [[crossover thrash]]); Wagner also learned to play guitar in record time, and contributed many of the album's guitar [[riff]]s.<ref name= manuval>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/arquivovalhalla/074819-sarcofago.html|title= Tributo ao Sarc<U+00F3>fago: a lenda vive|author= Tomasi, Eliton|date= 2008-07-07|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2009-01-27}}</ref> ''Rotting'' also marked their first change of [[alias]]es: the group's core duo renamed themselves "Wagner Antichrist" and "Gerald Incubus". Their visual department went through changes as well&nbsp;<U+2014> they dropped the arm and leg spikes because they made playing live difficult.<ref name= brigade6743>Filho, 1992, p. 43.</ref>

''Rotting'' was Sarc<U+00F3>fago's first release to have international distribution, handled in Europe by British label [[Music for Nations]],<ref name= brigade6743>Filho, 1992, p. 43.</ref> and by Maze/Kraze in America.<ref name= allrotting>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:d9fixqy5ldke|title= ((( Rotting > Overview )))|author= Rivadavia, Eduardo|publisher= [http://www.allmusic.com allmusic.com]|accessdate= 2009-02-01}}</ref> Maze Records released a censored version of ''Rotting'', blacking out the original cover and adding a sticker which read "Featuring the Original Lead Singer of Sepultura" without consulting the band. Infuriated by the label's actions, Sarc<U+00F3>fago sued them.<ref name= dynamte1359>Nemitz, 1994, p. 59.</ref>

===''The Laws of Scourge'' (1991<U+2013>1993)===

''The Laws of Scourge'' became Sarc<U+00F3>fago's best selling record, and responsible for their most extensive touring schedule to this date.<ref name= brigade10254>Gimenez, 1995, p. 54.</ref> Their tour trek also included their first international dates: they visited [[South American]] countries such as [[Peru]] and [[Chile]], and in [[Europe]] they played shows in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]].<ref name= dynamte1359>Nemitz, 1994, p. 59.</ref> In Brazil, their most important [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]] was to open for [[California]]n hardcore punk pioneers the [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]] in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]].<ref name= manuval>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/arquivovalhalla/074819-sarcofago.html|title= Tributo ao Sarc<U+00F3>fago: a lenda vive|author= Tomasi, Eliton|date= 2008-07-07|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2009-01-27}}</ref>

===''Hate'' (1994<U+2013>1996)===
Musically speaking, ''[[Hate (Sarc<U+00F3>fago album)|Hate]]'' is notable for its stripped-down, straightforward composition and the use of a [[drum machine]],<ref name= brigade10254>Gimenez, 1995, p. 54.</ref> the latter sparking some controversy.<ref name= brigade13016>Franzin, 1997, p. 16.</ref> Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use [[trigger pad]]s for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine.<ref name= brigade10254>Gimenez, 1995, p. 54.</ref>

The band cut their hair short, in protest of the masculine [[long hair]] style becoming popular due to the massive success of [[grunge]] in the early 1990s.<ref name= dynamte1358>Nemitz, 1994, p. 58.</ref> Men sporting long hair has traditionally been associated with [[counterculture]] groups,<ref>Synnott, 1987, p. 381.</ref> and it is especially present in the [[metalhead]] [[subculture]].<ref>Weinstein, 2000, p. 207.</ref> Wagner declared:
{{cquote|Every [[douchebag]] around is wearing long hair, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pearl Jam]] T-shirts, etc... We have nothing against these bands, but we have against [[Bandwagon effect|jumping the bandwagon]]. Its not right when it becomes a [[Fads and trends|trend]], because massification dumbs people down.<ref>Nemitz, 1994, p. 58. "Todo playboy que voc<U+00EA> v<U+00EA>, est<U+00E1> com o cabelo comprido, camisetinha do NIRVANA, do PEARL JAM, etc... N<U+00E3>o que tenhamos algo contra essas bandas, mas temos contra o embalo. Quando vira moda a gente n<U+00E3>o acha legal, porque a massifica<U+00E7><U+00E3>o deturpa a mente."</ref>}}

In late 1996, Sarc<U+00F3>fago released the ''Decade of Decay'' compilation which, amongst other things, featured [[demo tape|demo]] versions of their early songs and rare [[backstage]] photographs. The band described the CD as a "gift" to their fans.<ref name= brigade13018>Franzin, 1997, p. 18.</ref>

===''The Worst'' (1997<U+2013>2000)===
Sarc<U+00F3>fago's fifth and final album, ''[[The Worst (album)|The Worst]]'' (1997), sees the band slowing down in relation to the speed-oriented ''Hate'', and having a better grasp of [[drum programming]]. Minelli and Lamounier saw this record as a "summation" of their career.<ref name= brigade13016>Franzin, 1997, p. 16.</ref>

With the turn of the millennium came the ''Crust'' EP, Sarc<U+00F3>fago's swansong release. It was meant to be a preview of an upcoming album, but the band's core duo parted ways before commencing its recording.<ref name= valhalla2001>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/arquivovalhalla/074818-sarcofago.html|title= Sarc<U+00F3>fago: pioneirismo, pol<U+00EA>mica e death metal|author= Tomasi, Eliton|date= 2008-07-07|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2009-01-14}}</ref>

In March 2009, Wagner supposedly announced that Sarcofago would reunite, and their tour itinerary would include appearances at the ''[[Wacken Open Air]]'' and ''[[Hole in the Sky]]'' festivals, as well as dates in [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Tokyo]]. He stated it will be the original ''I.N.R.I.'' line-up, but this is the only tour they will be doing and there will be no new material.<ref name= metalstorm>{{cite web|url= http://www.metalstorm.ee/events/news_comments.php?news_id=8310|title= Sarc<U+00F3>fago&nbsp;<U+2014> To Reunite For Small Tour|author= Forrest, David|date= 2009-03-04|publisher= [http://www.metalstorm.ee Metal Storm]|accessdate= 2009-03-05}}</ref> A couple of days later, Lamounier himself wrote to the music press exposing this news report as a hoax.<ref name= blabber>{{cite web|url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=115644|title= Former SARC<U+00D3>FAGO Frontman Shoots Down Reunion Rumors|date= [[2009-03-06]]|publisher= [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net BLABBERMOUTH.NET]|accessdate= 2009<U+2013>03<U+2013>08}}</ref>

==Lyrical approach==
Inspired by [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Hellhammer]], Sarc<U+00F3>fago's early lyrics were openly Satanic.<ref name= brigade6744>Filho, 1992, p. 44.</ref> These lyrics frequently employed curse words and crude, obscene scenarios, such as in the case of "Desecration of (the) Virgin", a blasphemous take on [[Mother Mary]]'s [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].<ref>{{cite album-notes|title= I.N.R.I.|albumlink= I.N.R.I.

Whilst still polemical, by 1989's ''Rotting'' the band's stance on [[Christianity]] was more [[agnostic]] than Satanic. The original vinyl release came with a lengthy manifesto written by Lamounier, in which he criticized the [[Social alienation|alienating]] effect that [[Catholicism]] had on Brazilian society.<ref name= brigade47>{{cite web|url= http://www.metalpesado.com.br/BANDAS/biografia/NACIONAIS/SARC%D3FAGO/ENTREVISTA_47.htm|title= Sarc<U+00F3>fago: Ame ou Odeie|author= Cagni, Andr<U+00E9> & Fonseca, Marco|date= 1990|publisher= [http://www.rockbrigade.com.br Rock Brigade]|accessdate= 2009-01-22}} Archived at [http://www.metalpesado.com.br www.metalpesado.com.br]</ref> The band also questioned the [[Hypostatic union|divine nature]] of Christ, declaring he was just a regular man who died for his ideas.<ref name= dynamte1359>Nemitz, 1994, p. 59.</ref> On a less serious note the album featured "Sex, Drinks and Metal", a hedonistic ode to the [[headbanger]] lifestyle.<ref name= manujokerI>{{cite web|url= http://www.novometal.com/entrevistas/exibir.php?id=243|title= Manu Joker (Sarc<U+00F3>fago)|author= Vieira, Matheus|date= 2008-12-16|publisher= [http://www.novometal.com Novo Metal - O Portal do Metal]|accessdate= 2009-02-05}}</ref>

Their next album, ''The Laws of Scourge'', continued their new-found focus on more "reality-based" themes,<ref name= brigade6744>Filho, 1992, p. 44.</ref> with lyrics generally covering such death-related topics as suicide and homicide.<ref name= dynamte1358>Nemitz, 1994, p. 59.</ref> The band had trouble again with American censors, with the lyrics of the re-recorded version of "The Black Vomit" being forcibly omitted from the CD booklet as well as the entire "Prelude to Suicide" track.<ref name= dynamte1358>Nemitz, 1994, p. 59.</ref>

==Legacy==
The band left a widespread influence on [[black metal]] circles worldwide, particularly among the Scandinavian portion of the so-called "[[Black metal#The Second Wave|second wave]]" of the genre. "It is sobering," claimed ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine, "to think of what wouldn't have happened had 'I.N.R.I.' not been released."<ref name=blacktop20>"The First Wave," 2005, p. 42.</ref>

Notable black metal groups from neighbouring Finland were also affected by Sarc<U+00F3>fago's early output. [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]] founder Nuclear Holocausto said Sarc<U+00F3>fago was one of "the greatest influences" for the band;<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.anus.com/metal/about/interviews/beherit|title= Beherit Interview at the Dark Legions Archive|author=|date=|publisher= [http://www.anus.com ANUS.COM: American Nihilist Underground Society]|accessdate= 2009-01-31}}</ref> [[Mika Luttinen]] from [[Impaled Nazarene]] said that "nothing tops [[Slayer]]<U+00B4>s ''[[Reign In Blood]]'' or Sarcofago<U+00B4>s ''I.N.R.I.'', you know."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thundergodzine.com.br/entrevista_impaled_em_ingles.htm|title= ENTREVISTA: IMPALED NAZARENE (Em Ingl<U+00EA>s)|author= Oliveira, Elimar|date=|publisher= [http://www.thundergodzine.com.br Vers<U+00E3>o On Line THUNDERGOD ZINE]|accessdate= 2009-02-14}}</ref> Their version of "The Black Vomit" was included in ''Tribute to Sarc<U+00F3>fago.''<ref>Impaled Nazarene, "The Black Vomit."

Lamounier, however, has been critical of several of the bands influenced by Sarc<U+00F3>fago, especially bands from the Norwegian black metal scene, wondering how one of the wealthiest countries in the world could have produced such a scene. Although he liked [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], Wagner dubbed Euronymous a "nutcase" and considered [[Burzum]] "shit".<ref name= brigade13018>Franzin, 1997, p. 18.</ref> He also criticized black metal's purposely [[lo-fi]] recording aesthetic;<ref name= murdermusic>{{cite video|people= Kenny, David (Director)|year= 2007|date= Apr 13|url=|title= Murder Music: A History of Black Metal|medium = television|location = United Kingdom|publisher= ShashMedia}}</ref> Lamounier said that Burzum's guitar [[timbre]] "sounded like it was recorded through a [[transistor radio]]."<ref name= brigade13018>Franzin, 1997, p. 18.</ref>

==Conflict with Sepultura==
An oft-cited aspect of Sarc<U+00F3>fago's history is their long-lasting feud with Sepultura.<ref name= allbio>{{cite web|url= http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:09fyxqe5ldhe~T1|title= ((( Sarc<U+00F3>fago > Biography )))|author= Rivadavia, Eduardo|publisher= [http://www.allmusic.com allmusic.com]|accessdate= 2009-01-14}}</ref><ref name= valhalla2001>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/arquivovalhalla/074818-sarcofago.html|title= Sarc<U+00F3>fago: pioneirismo, pol<U+00EA>mica e death metal|author= Tomasi, Eliton|date= 2008-07-07|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2009-01-14}}</ref><ref name= brigade47>{{cite web|url= http://www.metalpesado.com.br/BANDAS/biografia/NACIONAIS/SARC%D3FAGO/ENTREVISTA_47.htm|title= Sarc<U+00F3>fago: Ame ou Odeie|author= Cagni, Andr<U+00E9> & Fonseca, Marco|date=|publisher= [http://www.rockbrigade.com.br Rock Brigade]|accessdate= 2009-01-22}} Archived at [http://www.metalpesado.com.br www.metalpesado.com.br]</ref><ref name= roadiecrew55>Ricardo, 2008, p. 55.</ref><ref name= barcinski28>Barcinski & Gomes, 1999, p. 28.</ref><ref name= brigade9717>Franzin, 1997, p. 17.</ref><ref name= manuval>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/arquivovalhalla/074819-sarcofago.html|title= Tributo ao Sarc<U+00F3>fago: a lenda vive|author= Tomasi, Eliton|date= 2008-07-07|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2009-01-27}}</ref> Although former Sepultura drummer [[Igor Cavalera]] eventually dismissed the entire affair as "child's play",<ref>Colmatti, 1997, p. 24.</ref> the music press fuelled their bitter rivalry for many years. Their conflict partially contributed to Sarcof<U+00E1>go's fame as the perennial "[[black sheep]]" of Brazilian [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name= brigade9717>Franzin, 1997, p. 17.</ref>

Tensions started after Lamounier parted ways with Sepultura, which led to a temporarily awkward situation. In Minelli's assessment, "everybody had forgotten it" until two years later, when D.D. Crazy smashed a bottle over [[Andreas Kisser]]'s head,<ref name= brigade9717>Franzin, 1997, p. 17.</ref> who had been recently recruited as Sepultura's new [[lead guitar]]ist.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes, 1999, p. 49.</ref> Kisser was being "too much of a douchebag".<ref name= brigade9717>Franzin, 1997, p. 17.</ref> S<U+00ED>lvio "Bibica" Gomes, Sepultura [[roadie]] and co-author of the band's ''Toda a Hist<U+00F3>ria'' biography, was one of the prime instigators of that fight.<ref name= roadiecrew55>Ricardo, 2008, p. 55.</ref> From then on, the Sarc<U+00F3>fago/Sepultura feud became a hotly debated topic in the Brazilian [[Underground music|underground]] metal scene.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

During an interview from ''The Worst'' era, Lamounier was asked to comment on Sepultura's well-publicized break-up,<ref name= brigade9717>Franzin, 1997, p. 17.</ref> when [[Max Cavalera]] left the band in January 1997.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes, 1999, p. 164.</ref> Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out the way they did as, in his words, "with what I knew of them, I think its quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences to get what they want. So, a brother backstabbing the other, deceiving their mother, cheating a friend... For money, I'll bet they're capable of anything.<ref>Franzin, 1997, p. 17. "Mas, pelo que eu conhecia deles, eu acho extremamente normal um irm<U+00E3>o trair o outro naquela fam<U+00ED>lia, eles n<U+00E3>o medem muito as coisas para conseguir o que querem. Ent<U+00E3>o, um irm<U+00E3>o trair o outro ali, um trair a m<U+00E3>e, o amigo trair o outro... Se for pra ganhar grana, aposto que eles s<U+00E3>o capazes de fazer tudo."</ref>

Annoyed by Lamounier meddling on "private family business", Max Cavalera's answer came through "Bumbklaatt", a song on [[Soulfly]]'s [[Soulfly (album)|debut album]].<ref>{{cite album-notes|title= Soulfly|albumlink= Soulfly (album)|bandname= [[Soulfly]]|year= 2005|notestitle= TRACK BY TRACK with Max Cavalera|url=|first=Steffan|last=Chirazi|pages=p. 14|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= [[New York City|New York]], [[NY]]}}</ref>

{{cquote|Grow tha fuck up you waste / Can't you see what it takes / To be a real man / Talking shit all your life / No integrity or pride / Fucking mind full of lies / You fake / You waste / You bumbklaatt...<ref>{{cite album-notes|title= Soulfly|albumlink= Soulfly (album)|bandname= [[Soulfly]]|year= 2005|notestitle= Bumbklaatt|url=|first=Max|last=Cavalera|pages=p. 17|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= [[New York City|New York]], [[NY]]}}</ref>}}

Max explained that, in [[Jamaican patois]], "Bumbklatt" means "[[blood clot]]" and it is also "a big insult... It means ''motherfucker'' or a ''piece of shit'' in Jamaica".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ink19.com/issues_F/98_05/ink_spots/soulfly_nf.html|title= Max Cavalera Flies Solo|author= Rivers, Cindy|date= May 1998|publisher= [http://www.ink19.com Ink 19 :: Music > Media > Thought]|accessdate= 2009-02-13}}</ref>

The animosity between the two groups eventually reached another major Brazilian band, crossover thrash act [[Ratos de Por<U+00E3>o]]. The band got involved in the affair after a 1987 Belo Horizonte gig, when a portion of the audience kept jeering at the band.<ref name= brigade6744>Filho, 1992, p. 44.</ref> One version of that story states that Lamounier and Ratos de Por<U+00E3>o singer [[Jo<U+00E3>o Gordo]] were antagonizing each other during the show.<ref name= manuval>{{cite web|url= http://whiplash.net/materias/arquivovalhalla/074819-sarcofago.html|title= Tributo ao Sarc<U+00F3>fago: a lenda vive|author= Tomasi, Eliton|date= 2008-07-07|publisher= [http://whiplash.net Rock e Heavy Metal - Whiplash!]|accessdate= 2009-01-27}}</ref> Another one tells us that when Gordo asked Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera who was "[[Spitting|gobbing]]" at his band, Max accused Sarc<U+00F3>fago.<ref name= brigade6744>Filho, 1992, p. 44.</ref>

Tensions flared up once again five years later when Sarc<U+00F3>fago, instead of Ratos de Por<U+00E3>o, were picked up to be the opening band of [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|DRI]]'s first Brazilian shows.<ref name= brigade9717>Franzin, 1997, p. 17.</ref> Ratos de Por<U+00E3>o and friends from S<U+00E3>o Paulo [[thrash metal]] group [[Korzus]] invaded Sarc<U+00F3>fago's backstage area; Jo<U+00E3>o Gordo then proceeded to [[Sucker punch|sucker-punch]] Lamounier while he was lying drunk on the floor,<ref name= roadiecrew56>Ricardo, 2008, p. 56.</ref> and Gordo's friends attacked the rest with [[Roller chain|motorcycle chain]]s.<ref name= brigade9717>Franzin, 1997, p. 17.</ref> A massive brawl ensued, with a member of DRI's [[road crew]] getting his arm broken.
