In fall practice before the [[2007 USC Trojans football team|2007 season]], Sanchez broke the thumb in his throwing hand, missing the first game against [[University of Idaho|Idaho]]; he returned the following week and the redshirt sophomore again served as the primary backup to senior John David Booty.

On October 13, Sanchez led USC to a 20&ndash;13 victory, overcoming a shaky first half where he threw two key interceptions, allowing Arizona to tie the game going into halftime.
