==Biography==
===Early life===
Eva Green was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] to a [[French people|French]] mother and a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] father, and was raised in the [[XVIIe arrondissement|17th arrondissement]] of Paris. She attended the [[American School of Paris]] for her formal years. Her mother is actress [[Marl<U+00E8>ne Jobert]]; her father, Walter Green, is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[dentist]], who appeared in the 1966 film ''[[Au hasard Balthazar]]'' &ndash; this was his first and only on-screen appearance. She has one sibling, a [[Fraternal twins|fraternal twin]] sister, Joy, from whom she is reportedly estranged. Green's name is pronounced /gre:n/,  approximately rhyming with "wren" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]; it comes from the Swedish word ''gren'', which means ''(tree) branch''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/film/evagreeninterview.html |last=Young  |first= Neil |title= Neil Young's Film Lounge, EVA GREEN : CONFESSIONS OF A NERVOUS <U+201C>MUSE<U+201D>  |date=December 30th, 2003}}</ref> She studied acting in Paris for three years, followed by a ten-week polishing course at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]] in [[London]], [[England]].

===Career===
====Theatre====
Green has stated that she wanted to be an Egyptologist when she was younger, but loved theatre classes. She left school at 16; she had achieved good grades, but 'couldn't bear school any more'.  Green began her professional career in 2001, when she performed in the play ''Jalousie En Trois Fax'', playing the role of Iris &ndash; a performance that brought her critical acclaim and a nomination for ''Les Moli<U+00E8>res'' in the category ''R<U+00E9>v<U+00E9>lation Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>trale F<U+00E9>minine''. In 2002, she made her second stage appearance as the coquette in the play ''Turcaret''.

====Film====
In 2003, Green made her feature film debut in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'' with [[Michael Pitt]] and [[Louis Garrel]]. She played the role of Isabelle. Described by Bertolucci as "so beautiful it's indecent", her performance brought her critical acclaim, as well as some notoriety for her extensive [[Nudity#Full nudity|full frontal nudity]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Bradshaw |first= Peter |url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,1141606,00.html |title= The Dreamers Review |publisher= The Guardian |date= [[2004-02-06]]}}</ref> While filming ''The Dreamers'', Green was said to have found Bertolucci manipulative, though in a creative way that wasn't pushy.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In comparison to her previous stage acting, she has said that acting in front of the camera makes you its "plaything".

She played Countess Clarisse de Dreux-Soubise (Clarisse d'Etigues in the original French novel by Maurice Leblanc) in the 2004 French film, ''[[Ars<U+00E8>ne Lupin]]'', directed by [[Jean-Paul Salom<U+00E9>]] and starring [[Romain Duris]] and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]. The film received mixed reviews. In 2005, she portrayed [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', starring opposite [[Orlando Bloom]] as Balian, a blacksmith from medieval France. 

Green was cast as "[[Bond girl]]" [[Vesper Lynd]] in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' with new [[007]] actor [[Daniel Craig]].  In an interview with [[The Daily Telegraph]] magazine she admitted that "I had reservations at the beginning thinking I'll be typecast as the Bond Girl - and after ''The Dreamers'' you have to be careful".  Having turned down the chance to audition a year before shooting started and undergone a first [[blind audition]] she was flown to [[Prague]] for a second audition literally days before filming commenced.  Given a new script which impressed her, she accepted the role.  There were reservations on the part of the studio, concerned about her having a French accent in an English role.  However, Green worked on her [[received pronunciation]] and the part was hers.  

She is the fifth French actress to portray a major "Bond girl" (after [[Claudine Auger]], [[Corinne Clery]], [[Carole Bouquet]], and [[Sophie Marceau]] plus the uncredited appearance of [[Miss World]] 1953, [[Denise Perrier]] in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'') and the first one born in the 1980s. As Vesper works for the British government, Green affected an English accent for the role.

''Casino Royale'' was released in theaters worldwide on [[November 17]], [[2006]].  In May of 2006, ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' named her #20 in its annual Hot 100 list.

Green has also joined the cast of [[New Line Cinema]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials: Northern Lights]]'', based on [[Phillip Pullman]]'s novel, and directed by [[Chris Weitz]]. She will play [[Serafina Pekkala]], the witch queen who guides [[Lyra Belacqua]] ([[Dakota Blue Richards]]) on her journey to a parallel universe. This project will reunite Green with Bond alum [[Daniel Craig]], and will see her work with [[Adam Godley]] and [[Nicole Kidman]], who are also in the cast.

On [[February 11]], [[2007]], Green won the [[Rising Star Award, BAFTA|BAFTA Orange Rising Star award]].

====Roles Eva Green was considered for====
Green met the director of ''[[The Constant Gardener]]'' but couldn't take the part of Tessa Quayle due to a clash with ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]''.  She was also offered a part in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[The Black Dahlia]]'' but again it clashed with ''Kingdom of Heaven'', though in the event filming was postponed. Green stated she declined the part because she did not want to be type-cast as a "femme fatale" after her role in ''The Dreamers'' {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

===Personal life===
Green speaks both [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] fluently, noticeably speaking native-like British English, and currently divides her time between her residences in [[Paris]] and [[London]].  She is currently dating the New Zealand actor [[Marton Csokas]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1998414,00.html |last = Jeffries |first= Stuart |title= He's the Bond girl, not me |date= [[2007-01-26]] |publisher=  The Guardian}}</ref> They met while shooting ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', in which he played her character's husband. She previously dated French actor Yann Claassen for over four years.
