==Taxonomy==
The genus ''Pudu'' was first erected by English naturalist [[John Edward Gray]] in 1850. ''Pudua'' was a Latinized version of the name proposed by [[Alfred Henry Garrod]] in 1877 but ruled invalid.  They are classified in the New World deer subfamily [[Capreolinae]] within the deer family [[Cervidae]]. The term "pud<U+00FA>" itself is derived from the [[Mapuche]] people of the Chilean region and translates to 'the people of southern Chile'.<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu"/> Because they live on the slopes of the [[Andes]] Mountain Range, they are also known as the "Chilean mountain goat".<ref name="elavellano-lodge.com"/>

Two species of Pud<U+00FA> are recognised-the southern pud<U+00FA> and the northern pud<U+00FA>. The southern pud<U+00FA> (''Pudu puda'') stands {{convert|35|to|45|cm|in|sp=us}} tall and weighs {{convert|6.4|to|13.4|kg|lb}}.<ref name="Geist" /> The antlers of the southern pud<U+00FA> grow to be {{convert|5.3|to|9|cm|in|1|sp=us}} long and tend to curve back, somewhat like a [[mountain goat]]. Their coat is a dark chestnut-brown, and tends to tuft in the front, covering the antlers. The northern pud<U+00FA> (''Pudu mephistophiles'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/forest_south.php |title=Forest South America |accessdate=20&nbsp;September 2009 |work=Animal Welfare Institute}}</ref> is close to half the height of the southern pud<U+00FA> and weighs {{convert|3.3|to|6|kg|lb|1|sp=us}}.<ref name="Geist">{{cite book | last = Geist | first = Valerius | title = Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology | publisher = Stackpole Books | date = September 1998 | pages = 119<U+2013>121 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bcWZX-IMEVkC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=pudu+deer+behavior&source=bl&ots=TJIQMJezKH&sig=VSDhTsp20akdZTdj3hFWKrWk16E&hl=en&ei=jjG1SsCUBtyx8QbqtOW5Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2# | isbn = 978-0811704960}}</ref> The antlers of the northern pud<U+00FA> grow to about {{convert|6|cm|in|1|sp=us}} long, also curving backward. Their coat tends to be lighter, but their faces are darker compared to the coat. Overall, the northern pud<U+00FA> is the smaller of the two deer and is lighter in color.<ref name="Geist" />

==Description ==
The pud<U+00FA> is the world's smallest deer.<ref name="Animal Planet"/> It is a small, short-legged animal, standing {{convert|32|to|44|cm|sp=us}} high at the shoulder and up to {{convert|85|cm|sp=us}} in length. Pud<U+00FA>s normally weigh up to {{convert|12|kg|sp=us}},<ref name="cites.org"/> but the highest recorded weight of a pud<U+00FA> is {{convert|13.4|kg}}.<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu">{{cite web|url=http://placentation.ucsd.edu/pudu.html|title=Chilean (Southern) Pudu|last=Benirschke|first=Kurt|date=2004|publisher=University of California, San Diego|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref> Pud<U+00FA>s have small, black eyes, <ref name="Animal Planet"/> black noses, and rounded ears with lengths of {{convert|7.5|to|8|cm|sp=us}}. [[Sexual dimorphism]] in the species includes an absence of [[antlers]] in females. Males have short, spiked antlers that are not forked, as seen in most species of deer. The antlers, which are shed annually,<ref name="Bristol Zoo">{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/learning/animals/mammals/pudu|title=Southern Pudu|publisher=Bristol Zoo|accessdate=19 September 2009}}</ref> can extend from {{convert|6.5|to|7.5|cm|sp=us}} in length and protrude from between the ears.<ref name="cites.org"/> Also on the head are large preorbital glands. Pud<U+00FA>s have small [[hoof|hooves]], [[dewclaw]]s, and a short tail about {{convert|4|to|4.5|cm|sp=us}} in length when measured without hair. Coat coloration varies with season, gender, and individual genes. The fur is long and stiff, typically pressed close to the body, with a reddish brown to dark brown hue.<ref name=Meyer2007>{{cite journal |author=Meyer W, Seegers U, Bock M. |year=2007 |title=Annual secretional activity of the skin glands in the Southern pudu

== Habitat and distribution ==
The pud<U+00FA> inhabits [[temperate rainforests]] in South America, where the dense underbrush and bamboo thickets offer protection from predators.<ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/>. Southern Chile, southwest Argentina, Chiloe island, and northwest South America are home to the deer, from coastal elevation to {{convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level.<ref name="cites.org"/><ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu"/>

The climate of the pud<U+00FA>'s habitat is composed of two main seasons: a damp, moderate winter and an arid summer. Annual precipitation in these areas of Argentina and Chile ranges from {{convert|2|to|4|m|ft|sp=us}}.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu" />

==Behavior==
===Social===

The pud<U+00FA> is a solitary animal whose behavior in the wild is largely unknown because of its secretive nature.<ref name="Frontier Patagonia">{{cite web|title=The Wildlife of Northern Patagonia|publisher=Frontier Patagonia|url=http://frontierpatagonia.com/FrontierPatagonia/Wildlife.htm|accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Pud<U+00FA>s are [[nocturnal]] and [[diurnality|diurnal]], but are mostly active in the morning, late afternoon, and evening. Their home range generally extends about {{convert|16|to|25|ha|acres}}, much of which consists of crisscrossing pud<U+00FA>-trodden paths. Each pud<U+00FA> has its own home range, or [[territory (animal)|territory]].<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu">{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pudu_puda.html|title=Pudu Puda|last=Pollard|first=Sarah|work=University of Michigan|publisher=Museum of Zoology|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref> A single animal's territory is marked with sizable [[feces|dung]] piles found on paths and near eating and resting areas. Large facial glands for scent communication allow correspondence with other pud<U+00FA> deer.<ref name="Bristol Zoo"/> Pud<U+00FA> do not interact socially, other than to [[mating|mate]].<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu" /> An easily frightened animal, the deer barks when in fear.<ref name="Brevard Zoo">{{cite web|title=Southern Pudu|publisher=Brevard Zoo|date=2009|url=http://www.brevardzoo.org/explore_australasia.php?id=164|accessdate=19 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="elavellano-lodge.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.elavellano-lodge.com/wildlife-fauna-observation-tours-patagonia-rainforest-ecotourism-chile.php|title=Fauna of Patagonia: rainforest fauna <U+2013> Chile|publisher=Elavellano Lodge|accessdate=19 September 2009}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=December 2009}} Its fur bristles and the pud<U+00FA> shivers when angered.<ref name="elavellano-lodge.com"/> 

Predators of the pud<U+00FA> include the [[Horned owl]], [[Culpeo|Andean fox]], [[Gray Fox|Magellan fox]], [[cougar]], and other small cats. The pud<U+00FA> is a wary animal that moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for scents of predators. Being a proficient climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued.<ref name="nypost.com">{{cite news |title=Meet the World's Smallest Deer |last=Williams|first=Jasmin |newspaper=New York Post |date=22 May 2008 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/classroom_extra/meet_the_world_smallest_deer_iYvey68QMn6kEW0peQbleJ |accessdate=17 September 2009 }}</ref> The longevity of the pud<U+00FA> ranges from 8 to 10&nbsp;years in the wild.<ref name="Brevard Zoo"/> The longest recorded life span is 15&nbsp;years and 9&nbsp;months. However, such longevity is rare and most pud<U+00FA>s die at a much younger age. These deer die from a wide range of causes. Maternal neglect as newborns as well as a wide range of diseases can decrease the population.<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu"/> If alarmed to a high degree, pud<U+00FA>s die from fear-induced [[cardiac]] complications.<ref name="elavellano-lodge.com"/>

===Diet===
The pud<U+00FA> is [[herbivore|herbivorous]],<ref name="elavellano-lodge.com"/> consuming vines, leaves from low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu"/><ref name="Chester Zoo">{{cite web|title=Pudu|publisher=Chester Zoo|date=2009|url=http://www.chesterzoo.org/AnimalsandPlants/Mammals/HoofedAnimals/Pudu.aspx|accessdate=19 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="LA Zoo">{{cite web|title=Southern Pudu|publisher=Los Angeles Zoo|url=http://www.lazoo.org/animals/mammals/southernpudu/index.html|accessdate=19 September 2009}}</ref> They can survive without drinking water for long periods due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in their diet.<ref name="Animal Planet"/>

Pud<U+00FA>s have various methods of obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and cautious nature create obstacles in attaining food.<ref name="LA Zoo"/> They stop often while searching for food to stand on their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu"/><ref name="nypost.com"/> Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so that the pud<U+00FA>s can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage.<ref name="Bristol Zoo"/> They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu"/>

===Reproduction===
Pud<U+00FA>s are solitary and only come together for [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]]. Mating season is in the Southern Hemisphere autumn, from April to May.<ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/> Pud<U+00FA> DNA is arranged into 70 [[chromosomes]].<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu" /> To mate, the pud<U+00FA> male rests his chin on the female's back, then sniffs her rear before mounting her from behind, holding her with his forelegs.<ref name="animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu" /> The [[gestation period]] ranges from 202 to 223&nbsp;days (around 7&nbsp;months) with the average being 210&nbsp;days.<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu" /> A single offspring or sometimes twins are born in austral spring, from November to January.<ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/><ref name="Brevard Zoo" /> Newborns weigh {{convert|700|to|1000|g|oz}} with the average birth weight being {{convert|890|g|oz}}.<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu" /><ref name="cites.org" /> Newborns less than {{convert|600|g}} or more than {{convert|1000|g}} die. Females and males weigh the same at birth.<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu" /> Fawns have reddish brown fur and Southern pud<U+00FA> fawns have white spots running the length of their back.<ref name="cites.org" /> Young are weaned after 2&nbsp;months. Females mature sexually in 6&nbsp;months while males mature in 8<U+2013>12&nbsp;months.<ref name="Bristol Zoo" /> Fawns are fully grown in 3&nbsp;months but may stay with their mothers for 8 to 12&nbsp;months.<ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/>

==Endangerment and conservation==
===Status and conservation===
Both species of pud<U+00FA> are classified as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by Red List of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]].<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/northern-pudu/pudu-mephistophiles/facts-and-status.html |title=Northern pudu (Pudu mephistophiles) |accessdate=2009-12-26 |date=2003 |publisher=Arkive }}</ref><ref name="Animal Planet"/><ref name="Brevard Zoo" /> Many pud<U+00FA>s are in zoo captivity and are studied. The Southern species is more easily maintained in captivity than the Northern, though small Northern populations can be found in some zoos.<ref name="placentation.ucsd.edu" /> Pud<U+00FA>s are difficult to transport because they are easily overheated and stressed.<ref name="cites.org" /> Pud<U+00FA>s are protected in various national parks. Parks require resources in order to enforce protection of the deer.<ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/>

[[Image:Bristol.zoo.southern.pudu.arp.jpg|thumb|alt=Pudu in captivity|Pudu in captivity at Bristol Zoo]]

There are efforts to preserve the pud<U+00FA> species before they become extinct. An international [[captive breeding]] program for the Southern Pud<U+00FA> led by Concepcion University in Chile has been started.<ref name="Bristol Zoo" /><ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/18848/0 |title=Pudu puda |accessdate=2009-12-25 |last=Jimenez |first=J. |coauthors=E.

===Threats===
The pud<U+00FA>'s endangerment is caused by the [[habitat destruction|destruction]] of their rainforest habitat. The land is cleared for human development, cattle ranching, agriculture, logging, and exotic tree plantations.<ref name="Bristol Zoo" /><ref name="Animal Planet" /><ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/> [[Habitat fragmentation]] and road accidents cause pud<U+00FA> deaths. They are taken from the wild as pets, as well exported illegally.<ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/><ref name="cites.org" /> They are overhunted and killed for food by specially trained hunting dogs.<ref name="Animal Planet" /><ref name="Chilean Pudu" /><ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/> With the introduction of [[exotic species]] of European red deer, pud<U+00FA>s must compete for food. Domestic dogs prey upon the deer and spread parasites through contact. Pud<U+00FA>s are very susceptible to diseases like [[Cestoda|bladder worms]], [[lungworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s, and [[heartworm]]s.<ref name=SouthernPuduIOLOE/><ref name="nypost.com" />
