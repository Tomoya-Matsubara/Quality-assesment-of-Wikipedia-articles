The '''''Fus<U+014D>''-class battleships''' {{nihongo||<U+6276><U+6851>}} were a pair of [[dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War I]]. Both patrolled briefly off the coast of China before being placed in reserve at the war's end. In 1922 ''Yamashiro'' became the first battleship in the IJN to successfully launch aircraft.

During the 1930s, both ships underwent a series of modernizations and reconstructions. {{ship|Japanese battleship|Fus<U+014D>||2}} underwent her modernization in two phases (1930&ndash;33, 1937&ndash;41), while {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}} was reconstructed from 1930 to 1935. The modernization increased their armor, replaced and upgraded their machinery, and rebuilt their [[superstructure]]s into the distinctive [[pagoda mast]] style. Despite the expensive reconstructions, both vessels were considered obsolescent by the eve of World War II, and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war. ''Fus<U+014D>'' served as a troop transport in 1943, while ''Yamashiro'' was relegated to training duty in the Inland Sea. Both underwent upgrades to their anti-aircraft suite in 1944 before transferring to [[Singapore]] in August 1944.

''Fus<U+014D>'' and ''Yamashiro'' were the only two Japanese battleships at the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], the southernmost action of the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], and both were lost in the early hours of 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that ''Fus<U+014D>'' broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for ''Yamashiro''; she did not survive the encounter, and Vice-Admiral [[Sh<U+014D>ji Nishimura]] went down with his ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.

==Background==
The design of the ''Fus<U+014D>''-class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the [[United States Navy]] in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters.<ref name=stille4>Stille, p. 4</ref> The IJN's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905, the last year of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the [[Battle of Tsushima]].<ref>Evans & Peattie, p. 124</ref>

In the aftermath, the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean: Britain and the United States.<ref name="stille4"/> [[Sat<U+014D> Tetsutar<U+014D>]], a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist, speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals. To that end, he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70% as many capital ships as the US Navy.<ref name=kaigun143>Evans & Peattie, p. 143</ref> This ratio, Sat<U+014D> theorized, would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict.<ref name=kaigun143/> Accordingly, the 1907 Imperial Defense Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships, {{convert|20000|LT|t|0}} each, and eight modern [[armored cruiser]]s, {{convert|18000|LT|t|0}} each.<ref name=kaigun150>Evans & Peattie, p. 150</ref> This was the genesis of the [[Eight-Eight Fleet Program]], the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships.<ref name=stille7>Stille, p. 7</ref>

The launch of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes,<ref>Evans & Peattie, p. 152</ref> and complicated Japan's plans. Displacing {{convert|17900|LT|t|abbr=on}} and armed with ten {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on|1}} guns, ''Dreadnought'' rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison.<ref>Sandler, p. 90</ref> The launch of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} the following year was a further setback for Japan's quest for parity.<ref>Evans & Peattie, p. 154</ref> When the two new [[Satsuma class battleship|''Satsuma''-class battleships]] and two [[Tsukuba class cruiser|''Tsukuba''-class armored cruisers]], launched by 1911, were outclassed by their British counterparts, the Eight-Eight Fleet Program was restarted.<ref>Evans & Peattie, p. 159</ref>

The first battleships built for the renewed Eight-Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the [[Kawachi class battleship|''Kawachi'' class]], ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908. In 1910, the Navy put forward a request to the [[National Diet|Diet]] (parliament) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once. Because of economic constraints, the proposal was cut first by the Navy Ministry to seven battleships and three battlecruisers, then by the cabinet to four armored cruisers and a single battleship. The Diet amended this by authorizing the construction of four battlecruisers (the [[Kong<U+014D> class battlecruiser|''Kong<U+014D>'' class]]) and one battleship, later named ''Fus<U+014D>'', in what became the Naval Emergency Expansion bill.<ref name=kaigun160>Evans & Peattie, p. 160</ref>

==Design==
''Fus<U+014D>'' was designed to work in conjunction with the four battlecruisers.<ref name=kaigun165>Evans & Peattie, p. 165</ref> After coordination with the British on the ''Kong<U+014D>'' class, Japanese designers had access to the latest British design studies in naval architecture and were now able to design their own capital ships.<ref name=skulski11>Skulski, p. 11</ref> In an effort to outmatch the American {{sclass-|New York|battleship|4}}, planners called for a ship armed with twelve {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} guns and faster than the {{convert|21|kn}} of their rivals.<ref name=stille21>Stille, p. 21</ref> [[Vickers]] files show that the Japanese had access to the designs for double- and triple-gun turrets, yet opted for six double turrets over four triple turrets.<ref name=conways229/>{{#tag:ref|Postwar Japanese accounts suggest that the system of four triple turrets was superior for defensive combat, while six double turrets were superior for offensive combat, meaning that six double turrets could engage more targets at once than four triple turrets.<ref name=conways229/>|group=Note}}

The final design&mdash;designated A-64 by the IJN&mdash;called for a displacement of {{convert|29000|LT|t|0}} with twelve {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} guns in six double turrets (two forward, two aft, two separated amidships) with a top speed of {{convert|23|kn}}.<ref name=kaigun166>Evans & Peattie, p. 166</ref> This design was superior to its American counterparts in armament, armor and speed, thus following the doctrine the Japanese had used since the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>95 of compensating for quantitative inferiority with qualitative superiority.<ref>Evans & Peattie, p. 59</ref>

==Description==
The ships had a length of {{convert|202.7|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28.7|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.7|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref name=conways229/> They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|29326|t|LT|sp=us}} at [[Standard_displacement#Standard_displacement|standard load]].<ref name=j5>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 25</ref> Their crew consisted of 1,198 officers and enlisted men in 1915 and 1,396 in 1935. During World War II, the crew probably totalled around 1,800<U+2013>1,900 men.<ref name=skulski30/>

During the ships' modernization during the 1930s, their forward superstructures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod foremasts. The rear superstructures were rebuilt to accommodate mounts for {{convert|127|mm|adj=on}} [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) guns and additional [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control directors]]. Both ships were also given [[torpedo bulge]]s to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor. In addition, their sterns were lengthened by {{convert|7.62|m|ft|sp=us}}. These changes increased their overall length to {{convert|212.75|m|ft|abbr=on}}, their beam to {{convert|33.1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and their draft to {{convert|9.69|m|ftin|sp=us}}. Their displacement increased nearly {{convert|4000|LT|t}} to {{convert|39154|LT|t}} at deep load.<ref name=j5/>

===Propulsion===
[[File:Fuso Trial Heading Left.jpg|thumb|right|''Fus<U+014D>'' running full-power trials on 10 May 1933 after her first reconstruction]]
The ''Fus<U+014D>''-class ships had two sets of [[John Brown and Company|Brown-Curtis]] direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s, each of which drove two propeller shafts. The medium-pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the high- and low-pressure turbines drove the inner shafts. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|40000|shp|lk=in}}, using steam provided by 24 Miyahara-type [[water-tube boiler]]s, each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil. The ships had a stowage capacity of {{convert|4000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of coal and {{convert|1000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref name=skulski17>Skulski, p. 17</ref> giving them a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|14|kn}}. Both ships exceeded their designed speed of {{convert|22.5|knots}} during their [[sea trial]]s; ''Fus<U+014D>'' reached {{convert|23|kn}} from {{convert|46500|shp|abbr=on}} and ''Yamashiro'' exceeded that with {{convert|23.3|kn}} from {{convert|47730|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref>

During their 1930s modernization, the Miyahara boilers on each ship were replaced by six new Kanpon oil-fired boilers, fitted into the former aft boiler room, and the forward [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] was removed. The Brown-Curtis turbines were replaced by four geared Kanpon turbines with a designed output of {{convert|75000|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=skulski17/> On her trials, ''Fus<U+014D>'' reached a top speed of {{convert|24.7|kn}} from {{convert|76889|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=conways229/> The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of {{convert|5100|LT|t}} of fuel oil that gave them a range of {{convert|11800|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=skulski17/>

===Armament===
[[File:Yamashiro 14-inch Front View.jpg|thumb|left|Admiral [[Sankichi Takahashi]] and the rear 14-inch turrets of ''Yamashiro'' in 1934]]
The twelve 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Vickers 14 inch/45 naval gun|14-inch]] guns<ref name=stille21/> of the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class were mounted in six twin-gun turrets, numbered from front to rear, each of which weighed {{convert|615|LT|t}}.<ref name="skulski19"/> The turrets had an elevation capability of &minus;5/+20 degrees.<ref name=skulski18>Skulski, p. 18</ref> They were arranged in an uncommon 2-1-1-2 style with [[superfire|superfiring]] pairs of turrets fore and aft; the middle turrets were not superfiring, and had a funnel between them.<ref name=stille21/> The decision to use six twin turrets rather than four triple turrets greatly affected the entire design of the class because the two extra turrets required a longer ship and increased the amount of armor required to protect the ship to a given standard. The location of the third and fourth turrets proved particularly problematic to the design of the class because the amidships turrets were not superfiring as in the subsequent {{sclass-|Ise|battleship|2}}s. This further increased the length of the ships because the barrels of the upper turret protruded over the lower turret,  requiring more space than a pair of superfiring turrets.<ref>Worth, p. 179</ref> Mounted amidships along the centerline of the ship, they had restricted arcs of fire,<ref name=stille21/> and their position forced the boiler rooms to be placed in less than ideal locations.<ref name="kaigun166"/> Another complication was the need to fit extra insulation and air conditioning in the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s of the amidships turrets to protect them from the heat generated in the adjacent boiler rooms.<ref name="skulski19"/> Originally both amidship gun turrets faced to the rear, but ''Fus<U+014D>''{{'}}s turret No. 3 was moved to face forward during her reconstruction in order to accommodate additional platforms around her funnel.<ref name=conways229/>

The main battery of the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first reconstruction of both vessels, the elevation of the main guns was increased to &minus;5/+43 degrees, giving a maximum firing range of {{convert|35450|yd|m}}. The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.<ref name="skulski18" /> 

By World War II, the guns used Type 91 [[Armour-piercing capped#Armor-piercing|armor-piercing, capped shells]]. Each of these shells weighed {{convert|673.5|kg|lb|sp=us}} and had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|775|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. They had a maximum range of {{convert|27800|m|yd|sp=us}} at +30 degrees of elevation and {{convert|35450|m|yd|sp=us}} at +43 degrees after modernization.<ref name=skulski19>Skulski, p. 19</ref> Also available was a {{convert|625|kg|lb|sp=us|adj=on}} [[Armour-piercing_capped#High-explosive|high-explosive shell]] that had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|805|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 183</ref> A special Type 3 ''Sankaidan'' incendiary [[shrapnel shell]] was developed in the 1930s for anti-aircraft use.<ref name="skulski19"/>

[[File:Fus<U+014D>-class battleship.jpg|thumb|right|A twin-gun 127 mm mount on board the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}}. The mounts used on board the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class were the same model.]]
As built, the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50-caliber [[15 cm/50 41st Year Type|six-inch guns]] mounted in single [[casemate]]s along the sides of the hull at the level of the upper deck. Eight guns were mounted per side, and each had an arc of fire of 130 degrees and a maximum elevation of +15 degrees. Each gun could fire a {{convert|45.36|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[Explosive material#High_explosives|high explosive]] projectile a maximum distance of {{convert|22970|yd|m}} at a rate of between four and six shots per minute. During their reconstruction in the 1930s, the maximum elevation of the guns was increased to +30 degrees, which increased their maximum range by approximately {{convert|900|m|yd}}.<ref name=skulski20>Skulski, p. 20</ref>

The ships also mounted five or six 40-caliber [[8&nbsp;cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun|76 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft (AA)]] guns. The {{convert|76|mm|0|adj=on}} high-angle guns were in single mounts on both sides of the forward superstructure, both sides of the second funnel, and each side of the aft superstructure (''Fus<U+014D>'' lacked the starboard side aft gun). Each of these guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a {{convert|6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} projectile with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|680|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a maximum height of {{convert|7500|m|ft}}.<ref name=skulski20/> Both ships were equipped with six submerged {{convert|533|mm|in|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, three on each [[broadside]].<ref name=stille21/>

The ''Fus<U+014D>'' class's secondary armament changed significantly over time. During the modernizations of the 1930s, all of the 76&nbsp;mm guns were replaced with eight 40-caliber {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[dual-purpose gun]]s. These guns were fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts.<ref name="skulski19" /> When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of {{convert|14700|m|yd}}; they had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|9440|m|ft}} at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 192<U+2013>93</ref> During reconstruction, the two foremost 152&nbsp;mm guns were also removed.<ref name=skulski30>Skulski, p. 30</ref>

The light AA armament of the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class changed dramatically from 1933 to 1944. During the first reconstruction, ''Fus<U+014D>'' was fitted with four quadruple {{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}} machine-guns,<ref name=skulski21>Skulski, p. 21</ref> while ''Yamashiro'' was fitted with eight twin {{convert|25|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} gun mounts.<ref name=stille22>Stille, p. 22</ref>  Both weapons were license-built French [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] designs.<ref>Campbell, pp. 200, 202</ref> The 25&nbsp;mm guns were mounted on the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class in single, double and triple mounts. This model was the standard Japanese light anti-aircraft gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. The twin and triple mounts "lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast".<ref name=stille11>Stille, p. 11</ref> The configuration of the anti-aircraft guns varied significantly; by the end of their final reconstruction, the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class mounted eight twin mounts. In 1943, seventeen single and two twin-mounts were added for a total of 37.<ref name=stille23>Stille, p. 23</ref> In August 1944, both were fitted with another twenty-three single, six twin and eight triple-mounts, for a total of 95 anti-aircraft guns in their final configuration.<ref name=skulski22>Skulski, p. 22</ref>

===Armor===
[[File:Yamashiro1944.png|thumb|left|''Yamashiro'' as she appeared in 1944]]
When the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class was completed, the ships' armor was "typical for a pre-[[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] battleship".<ref name=skulski16>Skulski, p. 16</ref> As built, the armor accounted for a displacement of {{convert|8588|LT|t}}, approximately 29% of the class's total displacement.<ref name=stille21/> Their [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] was {{convert|305|to|229|mm|in|0}} thick; below it was a [[strake]] of {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} armor. The [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor ranged in thickness from {{convert|32|to|51|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}. The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of {{convert|279.4|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} on the face, {{convert|228.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} on the sides, and {{convert|114.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the roof. The [[barbette]]s of the turrets were protected by armor 305&nbsp;mm thick, while the casemates of the 152&nbsp;mm guns were protected by 152&nbsp;mm armor plates. The sides of the [[conning tower]] were {{convert|351|mm|in}} thick. Additionally, the vessels contained 737 watertight compartments (574 underneath the armor deck, 163 above) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage.<ref>Skulski, pp. 16, 101, 163</ref>

During their reconstruction, the armor of the battleships was substantially upgraded. Their deck armor was increased to a maximum thickness of {{convert|114|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}, and a longitudinal [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] of {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} of high-tensile steel was added to improve the underwater protection.<ref>Skulski, pp. 16, 101</ref> This brought the total armor tonnage up to {{convert|12199|LT|t}}, approximately 31% of the total displacement of the ''Fus<U+014D>'' class. Even after these improvements, the armor was still incapable of withstanding 14-inch shells.<ref name=skulski16/>

===Aircraft===
[[File:Yamashiro Sparrow Hawk.jpg|thumb|A Sparrowhawk taking off from ''Yamashiro'']]
''Yamashiro'' was briefly fitted with an aircraft [[flight deck|flying-off platform]] on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched [[Gloster Sparrowhawk]] and [[Sopwith Camel]] [[fighter (aircraft)|fighters]] from it, becoming the first Japanese ship to launch aircraft. When she was modernized in the 1930s, a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] and a collapsible [[crane (machine)|crane]] were fitted on the stern, and both ships were equipped to operate three [[floatplane]]s, although no [[hangar]] was provided. The initial [[Nakajima E4N|Nakajima E4N2]] biplanes were replaced by [[Nakajima E8N|Nakajima E8N2]] biplanes in 1938 and then by [[Mitsubishi F1M]] biplanes from 1942 on.<ref>Skulski, pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref>

===Fire control and sensors===
When completed in 1915, the ships had two {{convert|3.5|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} and two {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} [[rangefinder]]s in the forward superstructure, a {{convert|4.5|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} rangefinder on the roof of Turret No. 2, and 4.5-meter rangefinders in Turrets 3, 4, and 5. In late 1917 a [[fire-control director]] was installed on a platform on the [[foremast]]. The 4.5-meter rangefinders were replaced by {{convert|8|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} instruments in 1923. During ''Fus<U+014D>''{{'}}s first modernization, four directors for the 12.7&nbsp;mm AA guns were added, one on each side of the fore and aft superstructures, and an eight-meter rangefinder was installed at the top of the pagoda mast. This was replaced by a {{convert|10|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} rangefinder during 1938. At the same time, the two 3.5-meter rangefinders on the forward superstructure were replaced by directors for the 25&nbsp;mm AA guns. Additional 25&nbsp;mm directors were installed on platforms on each side of the funnel.<ref>Skulski, pp. 28<U+2013>29, 82, 84</ref>{{#tag:ref|Available sources do not cover the fire control for ''Yamashiro'' in any detail.|group=Note}}

While the ships were in [[drydock]] in July 1943, [[List_of_Japanese_World_War_II_radar#Shipborne_Radar|Type 21]] air search [[radar]] was installed on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 [[early warning radar]] units were fitted. ''Yamashiro'' mounted hers on the mainmast, while ''Fus<U+014D>'' was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel.<ref>Skulski, p. 26</ref>

Two advanced versions of the class were planned, but the final design differed so markedly from ''Fus<U+014D>''{{'s}} that they became the ''Ise'' class.<ref name="kaigun166" /> When she was completed in 1915, ''Fus<U+014D>'' was considered the first modern battleship of the Japanese Navy. She outclassed her American counterparts of the [[New York class battleship|''New York'' class]] in firepower and speed, and was considered the "most powerfully armed battleship in the world".<ref name="kaigun166"/> Despite extensive modernization in the 1930s, both battleships were considered obsolescent by the commencement of World War II.<ref name="stille23"/> Following the loss of much of Japan's aircraft carrier fleet by 1943, a proposal was floated that would have converted both vessels into hybrid battleship-carriers. Work was scheduled to commence in June 1943, but the plan was cancelled and the two ''Ise''-class battleships were converted instead.<ref>Stille, pp. 22, 26</ref><ref name=conways229>Gardiner & Gray, p. 229</ref>

==Service==
{{Main|Japanese battleship Fus<U+014D> |Japanese battleship Yamashiro}}
''Fus<U+014D>'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 8 November 1915 and assigned to the 1st Division<ref group=Note>Skulski and Preston use Squadron while Hackett uses BatDiv, presumably Battleship Division.</ref> of the [[1st Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Fleet]] on 13 December.<ref name=s12>Skulski, p. 12</ref> The ship did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the [[Central Powers]] in Asia by the time she was completed. She served as the flagship of the 1st Division during 1917 and 1918,<ref name=p9>Preston, p. 199</ref> and patrolled off the coast of China during that time. The ship aided survivors of the Great Kanto Earthquake between 9 and 22 September 1923. In the 1920s, ''Fus<U+014D>'' conducted training off the coast of China and was often placed in reserve. After assignment as a training ship in 1936 and 1937, she briefly operated in Chinese waters in early 1939.<ref>Skulski, pp. 12<U+2013>13, 28<U+2013>29</ref>

''Yamashiro'' was completed on 31 March 1917<ref name=ha/> and assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917<U+2013>18, though she had no combat role in World War I.<ref name=p9/> Like her sister, she patrolled off the coast of China during the war and assisted during the Great Kanto Earthquake. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]], China, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China. ''Yamashiro'' became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled [[Kawanishi E7K|Kawanishi E7K2]] floatplanes.<ref name=ha/>

===World War II===
In April and May 1941, ''Fus<U+014D>'' and ''Yamashiro'' were attached to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet,<ref>Skulski, p. 13</ref> but the two ships spent most of the war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay.<ref name="stille23" /> When the war started for Japan on 8 December,<ref group=Note>[[Japan Standard Time]] is 19 hours ahead of [[Hawaiian Standard Time]], so in Japan, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] happened on 8 December.</ref> the division [[sortie]]d from [[Hashirajima]] to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Air Fleet]] attacking [[Pearl Harbor]], and returned six days later.<ref name=ha>Hackett (2010)</ref> On 18 April 1942, they pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the [[Doolittle Raid]].<ref name=ha/> Commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Shir<U+014D> Takasu]], the division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on [[Midway Island]] ([[Operation MI]]).<ref>Rohwer, pp. 168<U+2013>69</ref><ref>Parshall & Tully, p. 454</ref><ref>Parshall & Tully, p. 46</ref>

Afterwards, ''Yamashiro'' returned to home waters, where she stayed until August 1943; the next month, she became a training ship for midshipmen.<ref name="stille23"/> In July 1943,  ''Yamashiro'' was at the Yokosuka drydock, then was briefly assigned as a training ship on 15 September before loading troops on 13 October bound for [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] Naval Base, arriving on the 20th. She sailed for Japan on 31 October.<ref name=ha/> On 8 November, the submarine USS {{USS|Halibut|SS-232|2}} fired torpedoes at ''Junyo'' that missed, but hit ''Yamashiro'' with a torpedo that failed to detonate.<ref>Tully, p. 30</ref> Returning to Japanese waters, ''Yamashiro'' resumed her training duties.<ref name=ha/>

During the [[invasion of Saipan|US invasion of Saipan]] in June 1944, Japanese troop ships attempting to reinforce the defenses were sunk by submarines. [[Shigenori Kami]], chief of operations of the Navy Staff, volunteered to command ''Yamashiro'' to carry troops and equipment to Saipan. If the ship actually reached the island, he intended to deliberately beach the ship before it could be sunk and to use its artillery to defend the island. After [[Ry<U+016B>nosuke Kusaka]], [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Combined Fleet]], also volunteered to go, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Hideki T<U+014D>j<U+014D>]] approved the plan, known as Operation ''Y-GO'', but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] on 19 and 20 June.<ref>Tully, pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref>

''Fus<U+014D>'' was assigned to the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] at [[Etajima, Hiroshima]], for use as a training ship between 15 November 1942 and 15 January 1943. On 8 June, she rescued 353 survivors from ''Mutsu'' when that ship exploded at Hashirajima.<ref name=ha2>Hackett (2003)</ref> After carrying supplies to Truk Naval Base in August,<ref name=ha2/> ''Fus<U+014D>'' made for [[Eniwetok]] two months later to be in a position to intercept an anticipated attack, returning to Truk on October 26.<ref name=ha2/> She arrived on 21 February at [[Lingga Island]], and was employed there as a training ship,<ref>Skulski, p. 14</ref> before refitting at Singapore between 13 and 27 April and returning to Lingga. She was transferred to [[Tawi-Tawi]] on 11 May,<ref name=ha2/> and provided cover for the abortive attempts to [[Battle of Biak|reinforce Biak Island]] at the end of the month.<ref name="stille23"/><ref>Rohwer, p. 325</ref> ''Fus<U+014D>'' sailed to [[Tarakan Island]] off [[Borneo]] to refuel in early July before returning to Japan, escaping an attack by the submarine {{USS|Pomfret|SS-391|2}}. She was refitted in early August at Kure.<ref name=ha2/>

Both ships were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|2nd Fleet]] on 10 September. ''Yamashiro'' and ''Fus<U+014D>'' alternated in the role of division [[flagship]] under Vice Admiral Sh<U+014D>ji Nishimura. They departed Kure on 23 September for Lingga Island, carrying the Army's [[25th Independent Mixed Regiment]], and escaped an attack by the submarine {{USS|Plaice|SS-390|2}} the next day. They arrived on 4 October, then transferred to Brunei to offload their toops and refuel in preparation for Operation ''Sh<U+014D>-G<U+014D>'', the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the [[invasion of Luzon]].<ref name=ha/>

====Battle of Surigao Strait====
[[File:Surigao straight.jpg|left|thumbnail|250px|The Battle of Surigao Strait]]

Nishimura's "Southern Force" left [[Brunei]] at 15:30 on 22 October 1944, heading east into the [[Sulu Sea]] and then to the north-east into the [[Mindanao Sea]]. Intending to join Vice-Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s force in [[Leyte Gulf]], they passed west of [[Mindanao Island]] into Surigao Strait, where they met a large force of battleships, cruisers and destroyers lying in wait. The [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] would become the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.<ref>Tully, pp. xi, 43, 56</ref>

At 09:08 on 24 October, ''Yamashiro'', ''Fus<U+014D>'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Mogami (1934)|''Mogami'']] spotted a group of  27 planes, including [[TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s and [[SB2C Helldiver]] [[dive bomber]]s escorted by [[F6F Hellcat]] fighters, that had been launched from the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}.<ref>Tully, p. 66</ref> Around 20 sailors on ''Yamashiro'' were killed by strafing and rocket attacks.<ref>Tully, pp. 68, 73</ref> ''Fus<U+014D>''{{'s}} catapult and both floatplanes were destroyed, and another bomb hit the ship near Turret No. 2 and penetrated the decks, killing everyone in No. 1 secondary battery.<ref>Tully, pp. 66, 120</ref>

Nishimura issued a telegram to Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]] at 20:13: "It is my plan to charge into Leyte Gulf to [reach] a point off Dulag at 04:00 hours on the 25th."<ref>Tully, p. 100</ref> At 22:52, his force spotted three or four [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s and opened fire, damaging {{USS|PT 130||2}} and {{USS|PT 152||2}} and forcing all of them to retreat before they could launch their torpedoes.<ref>Tully, pp. 110<U+2013>12</ref>

One or two torpedoes, possibly fired by the destroyer {{USS|Melvin|DD-680|2}}, hit ''Fus<U+014D>'' amidships on the starboard side at 03:09 on the 25th; she listed to starboard, slowed down, and fell out of formation.<ref>Tully, p. 152</ref> Some Japanese and American eyewitnesses later claimed that ''Fus<U+014D>'' broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour, but they specifically mentioned only the size of the fire on the water, and not any details of the ship.<ref>Tully, pp. 275<U+2013>77</ref> Historian [[John Toland (author)|John Toland]] agreed in 1970 that ''Fus<U+014D>'' had broken in two,<ref>Toland, pp. 697<U+2013>98</ref> but according to historian Anthony Tully in 2009, "Fuso was torpedoed, and as a result of progressive flooding, upended and capsized within forty minutes."<ref>Tully, p. 179</ref> She sank between 03:38 and 03:50; only a few dozen men survived her rapid descent and massive oil fire, and only ten reached shore.<ref>Tully, pp. 178, 179, 261</ref>

At 03:52, ''Yamashiro'' was attacked by a large formation to the north commanded by Rear Admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]]. First came 6- and {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} shells from a line of  eight cruisers,<ref>Tully, pp. 184, 190</ref> then {{convert|16|in|adj=on}} shells from a line of six battleships.<ref>Tully, p. 191</ref> The main bombardment lasted 18 minutes, and ''Yamashiro'' was the only target for seven minutes.<ref>Tully, p. 197</ref> The first rounds hit the [[forecastle]] and pagoda mast, and soon the entire battleship appeared to be ablaze. ''Yamashiro''{{'s}} two forward turrets targeted her assailants, and the secondary armament targeted the American destroyers plaguing ''Mogami'' and the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Asagumo (1938)|''Asagumo'']].<ref>Tully, pp. 198, 199</ref> There was a big explosion at 04:04, possibly from one of the middle turrets. She was hit between 04:03 and 04:09 near the starboard engine room by a torpedo, and Nishimura wired to Kurita: "We proceed till totally annihilated. I have definitely accomplished my mission as pre-arranged. Please rest assured."<ref>Tully, p. 212</ref> At the same time, Oldendorf issued a cease-fire order to the entire formation after hearing that the destroyer [[USS Albert W. Grant (DD-649)|''Albert W. Grant'']] was taking [[friendly fire]], and the Japanese ships also ceased fire.<ref name="Tullypp">Tully, pp. 214<U+2013>15</ref>

''Yamashiro'' increased speed,<ref name="Tullypp" /> but she had been hit by two to four torpedoes, and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21.<ref>Tully, pp. 216<U+2013>17</ref> Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.<ref>Tully, p. 218</ref>
