'''Presque Isle State Park''' ({{pron-en|<U+02CC>pr<U+025B>sk.<U+02C8>a<U+026A>l}}) is a {{convert|3112|acre|0|sing=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] on an arching sandy [[peninsula]] that juts into [[Lake Erie]], {{convert|4|mi}} west of the city of [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], in [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]], [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States. The peninsula sweeps northeastward, surrounding [[Presque Isle Bay]] along the park's southern coast. It has {{convert|13|mi}} of roads, {{convert|21|mi}} of recreational trails, 13 beaches for swimming, and a marina. Popular activities at the park include [[human swimming|swimming]], [[boating]], [[hiking]], [[biking]], and [[bird watching]].

The recorded history of Presque Isle begins with the [[Erie (tribe)|Erielhonan]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe who gave their name to Lake Erie, and includes French, [[United Kingdom|British]], and American forts, as well as serving as a base for [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s fleet in the [[War of 1812]]. With the growing importance of [[ship transport|shipping]] on Lake Erie in the 1800s, Presque Isle became home to several [[lighthouse]]s and what became a [[United States Coast Guard]] station. In 1921 it became a state park, and as of 2007 it hosts over 4 million visitors per year, the most of any Pennsylvania state park.<ref name="dcnr"/>

The Presque Isle peninsula formed on a [[moraine]] from the end of the [[Wisconsin Glaciation]] and is constantly being reshaped by waves and wind. This leads to seven ecological zones within the park, which provide a classic example of [[ecological succession]]. A [[National Natural Landmark]] since 1967, the park has been named one of the best places in the US to [[birding|watch birds]], and protects them in its Gull Point State Park Natural Area. The new [[Tom Ridge Environmental Center]] at the entrance to the park allows visitors to learn  more about the park and its ecology. Presque Isle State Park has been chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks".

== History ==
{{Main|History of Presque Isle}}

=== Early inhabitants ===
Presque Isle was formed at the end of the [[Last ice age|Wisconsin Glaciation]] about 11,000 years ago.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle">{{cite web| url=http://www.pserie.psu.edu/seagrant/rediscoveries/curriculum/PresqueIsle.pdf|format=PDF| title = Presque Isle - Origin of Presque Isle | accessdate=2007-10-31| publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]]}}</ref> The earliest known inhabitants of the southern Lake Erie coast were the [[Erie (tribe)|Erielhonan]], also known as the "Eriez", an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] speaking tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Erielhonan meant the "Cat" or "Raccoon" people, and the name "Erie", a corruption of Erielhonan, became the name of the lake and county in which Presque Isle Park is found and of the city nearest the park.<ref name="Native">{{cite book| last = Smith| first = Marvin T.| title = Archaeology of Aboriginal Cultural Change in the Interior Southeast: Depopulation During the Early Historic Period| publisher = University Press of Florida| year = 1987| location = Gainesville }}</ref><ref name ="donehoo">{{cite book |last=Donehoo |first= Dr. George P. |title= A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania |origdate= 1928 |url= http://www.srbc.net/docs/IndianNamesDataChart.PDF|format= PDF|accessdate= 2007-11-16|edition= Second Reprint Edition |year= 1999|publisher= Wennawoods Publishing |location= [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]]|isbn= 1-889037-11-7|quote = ISBN refers to a 1999 reprint edition. URL is for the [[Susquehanna River Basin Commission]]'s web page of Native American Place names, quoting and citing the book.|page= 290}}</ref>

An Erielhonan legend taught that the [[Great Spirit]] led them to Presque Isle because of the wealth of [[game (food)|game]], the abundance of clean [[fresh water]], and the cool breezes "coming from the land of snow and ice", i.e. Canada. Another legend explains how the Eriez ventured into Lake Erie in search of the land where the sun set.<ref name="dcnr-history">{{cite web| url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/presqueisle/presqueisle_history.aspx| title = Presque Isle State Park - History | accessdate=2007-09-11|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}</ref>  The spirit of the lake blew a fierce storm to keep the Eriez from finding the sun. To protect the Eriez from the storm, their god laid his outstretched arm into the lake, giving them safety during the storm. The god's arm remained in the lake, protecting the tribe's future generations.<ref name="Native"/>

The Erielhonan are believed to have lived and farmed on the peninsula.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/> They fought several wars, the last starting in 1653 with the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]]. After initial victories over the [[Seneca tribe|Senecas]], in 1654 the Erielhonan lost their largest village, Rique (at the modern city of Erie), destroyed by 1,800 Iroquois warriors. By 1656 the Erielhonan were destroyed as a people, although the Iroquois adopted survivors, absorbed primarily into the Senecas.<ref name="Native"/><ref name ="donehoo"/>

=== Forts, settlers, and War of 1812 ===
The French first named the peninsula in the 1720s; ''[[presque-isle]]'' means peninsula (lit. "almost an island") in French. They built [[Fort Presque Isle]] at the modern city of Erie in the summer of 1753, naming it for the peninsula that protected the fort. The French also built two "military outposts" (probably of brick) on Presque Isle itself, one at the entrance to the peninsula and the other at the eastern point.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/> During the [[French and Indian War]], the French abandoned their outposts and burned their fort in 1759.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bates |first= Samuel P. |title= History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Volume I |year= 1884 |publisher= Warner, Beer's and Company |location= [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] |page= 503}}</ref> The British constructed a new fort of the same name that year, which later fell to Native American forces on June 19, 1763, during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Dowd |first= Gregory Evans |title= War under Heaven: Pontiac, the Indian Nations, & the British Empire |year= 2002 |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|location= [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] |isbn= 0-8018-7079-8 |page= 128}}</ref>

Presque Isle passed from British to American control after the [[American Revolutionary War]], and the Iroquois sold their rights to the land containing the peninsula to the United States at the second [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)|Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in 1784. Pennsylvania did not acquire an undisputed title to the land until it purchased the [[Erie Triangle]] from the Federal government on April 3, 1792. In 1795 General [[Anthony Wayne]] built a new, American "Fort Presque Isle", and on April 18 of that year the town of "Presqu' Ile", since renamed Erie, was laid out near it. Wayne died at the fort on December 15, 1796, and was originally buried there.<ref>{{cite book |last= Albert |first= George Dallas |title= Report of the Commission to Locate the Site of the Frontier Forts of Pennsylvania.

[[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]] was formed from [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] on March 12, 1800. [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]], which initially contained both the Presque Isle peninsula and village of Erie, was one of the original townships. Erie was named the [[county seat]] in 1803, incorporated as a borough in 1805, and became a city in 1851.<ref name="godcharles">{{cite book |last= Godcharles |first= Frederic A. |authorlink = Frederic A. Godcharles |title= Pennsylvania: Political, Governmental, Military and Civil: Political and Civil History Volume |edition= First edition |year= 1933 |publisher= The American Historical Society |location= New York, New York }}</ref>

During the [[War of 1812]], Presque Isle played a part in the victory over the British in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]].<ref name="Frank">{{citeweb|publisher=Flagship Niagara League|url=http://www.brigniagara.org/battle.htm|title = Niagara History<U+2013>Battle of Lake Erie |accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> Oliver Hazard Perry,  commander of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay to build a pier and a place to construct six of the nine ships in his fleet; some of the timber used probably came from Presque Isle. Using this location protected the men by creating an obstacle, forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/><ref name="Frank"/>

The "Little Bay" near the tip of the peninsula where the ships sheltered, next to the current Perry's Monument, was later named "Misery Bay" because of the hardships during the winter of 1813<U+2013>1814, after the men returned there from battle.<ref name="dcnr-history"/> Many men suffered from [[smallpox]] and were kept in [[quarantine]] near the bay. A great many infected men died and were buried in what is now called Graveyard Pond.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/><ref name="dcnr-history"/><ref name="Frank"/>

After the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, Perry's two largest ships were badly damaged, and the [[USS Lawrence (1813)|US Brig ''Lawrence'']] was intentionally sunk in Misery Bay. The ''Lawrence'' was raised in 1875 but was burned while on display at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]]. The [[USS Niagara (1813)|US Brig ''Niagara'']] was initially repaired, then sunk for preservation in 1820 and raised in 1913, and parts of it were eventually used in the modern [[U.S. Brig Niagara (replica)|''Niagara'']], based across Presque Isle Bay in Erie.<ref name="dcnr-history"/><ref name="Frank"/>

=== Lighthouses and Coast Guard ===
[[File:Presque Isle Lighthouse 2.jpg|thumb|The Presque Isle Light began operation in 1873 and is still in service today.|alt=A brick house with a white, square lighthouse tower attached to the house.]]
The Presque Isle peninsula forms Presque Isle Bay, which serves as a natural harbor for Erie. During the  19th century, as Lake Erie navigation grew more important, shipping aids were built on Presque Isle. As of 2007, two main [[lighthouses]] can be found in the park. The [[Erie Harbor North Pier Light]] began as a wooden tower, erected in 1830. In 1858, a stronger steel structure was brought from France and installed at Erie to replace the wooden beacon, which had been damaged by a schooner. This light still stands at the far eastern side of the park, near the inlet between the lake and the bay.<ref name="dcnr-history"/>

The [[Presque Isle Light]] was constructed in 1872 on the north side of Presque Isle and was lit on July 12, 1873. This light is {{convert|74|ft}} tall, with a red brick house that is used as a park residence. Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and flashes a white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie.<ref name="dcnr-history"/> A third, smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the [[Erie Waterworks]] on the Presque Isle Bay side of the peninsula. Today it stands in the ferry landing for the Erie [[water taxi]] service, south of the former waterworks along the state park's multi-purpose trail on the southeast side of Presque Isle.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=290 |title = Presque Isle Lighthouse, Pennsylvania |publisher = Lighthousefriends.com |accessdate = 2007-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Port of Erie  | url=http://www.porterie.org/transit_map_lg.gif|title= Bayfront Transportation Systems | accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071127080116/http://www.porterie.org/transit_map_lg.gif |archivedate = November 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

[[United States Life-Saving Service]] District 9 opened a life-saving station (LSS) at Presque Isle in 1876. William Clark was the keeper from 1877 until he drowned in 1891. He was succeeded by Andrew Jansen, who was the keeper until 1914. When the Life-Saving Service and the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] merged in 1915 to become the [[United States Coast Guard]], LSS Presque Isle, also called the Erie life-saving station, became Coast Guard Station #236. The station, still in operation, is assigned to the Ninth District of the United States Coast Guard.<ref name="coastguard">{{cite web | url = http://www.uscg.mil/d9/ | title = Ninth Coast Guard District | accessdate = 2007-11-01 | publisher = [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]}}</ref>

=== Modern era and state park ===
In 1908, Erie started building a [[waterworks]] on Presque Isle to provide [[fresh water]] for the city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two [[reservoir|basins]] on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to [[Water purification#Sedimentation|settle]], removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for [[zebra mussel]] control and as a concession stand for bicycle and surrey rentals within the state park.<ref name="dcnr-history"/>

[[File:Presque Isle Waterworks Lighthouse.jpg|thumb|left|The small lighthouse along the multi-purpose trail in the state park, near the former waterworks|alt=A small off-white lighthouse with a red roof and the trunks of two trees overlooking a bay with a city in the background.]]
As Pennsylvania's only surf beach, the Presque Isle beaches were already a popular attraction when the state legislature authorized the creation of the "Pennsylvania State Park at Erie" in May 1921. Oversight was given to the new "State Park and Harbor Commission of Erie", including local representation, instead of to the state Department of Forests and Waters. Presque Isle quickly became the most popular state park in Pennsylvania. Presque Isle was an early example of locating state parks near cities, a trend that would become prevalent statewide only in the 1960s.<ref name="cupper"/>

The first paved road was built in the park in 1924,<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/> and today 13&nbsp;miles (21&nbsp;km) of roads run through the park.<ref name="dcnr"/> [[Pennsylvania Route 832]], which is the main road to the park, is also known as Peninsula Drive.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]]| title = General Highway Map, Erie County, Pennsylvania |year=2007 |scale=1 : 65,000 |url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/GHS/Roadnames/erie_GHSN.PDF |format=PDF|accessdate= 2007-07-27}} ''Note: shows Presque Isle State Park ''</ref> Presque Isle has been referred to as "Peninsula State Park".<ref>{{cite book|title=Pennsylvania: A Guide To The Keystone State|author=Writers' Program of the Work Progress Administration in the State of Pennsylvania|authorlink= Federal Writers' Project|coauthors=Pennsylvania State Department of Public Instruction|url=http://collection1.libraries.psu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/digitalbks2&CISOPTR=18341|year=1940|month=December |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford UP]]|location=[[New York, NY]]|accessdate=2007-11-24|series=American Guide Series|page=xxviii|nopp=true}}</ref> The Perry Monument in the park was constructed in 1926 near Misery Bay and the burials in Graveyard Pond.<ref name="dcnr-history"/>

By 1937 official state publications were referring to the park as "Presque Isle State Park",<ref>{{cite news |title= Pennsylvania has everything! |url= http://www.libraries.psu.edu/do/digitalbookshelf/28559645/28559645_part_1.pdf |format= PDF |work= Brochure |publisher= Pennsylvania State Publicity Commission |year=1937 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071127080116/http://www.libraries.psu.edu/do/digitalbookshelf/28559645/28559645_part_1.pdf |archivedate = November 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> and that same year it led the state park system with 1.4 million visitors. In the 1950s the peninsula was enlarged to accommodate new roads and parking, using 3 million&nbsp;cubic yards (2,294,000&nbsp;m<U+00B3>) of sand dredged from the interior of the peninsula. The resulting basin became the current marina.

Presque Isle is a [[Spit (landform)|recurved sand spit]] that was formed during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin glacial period]], which ended around 10,000 BC and was the last major continental glaciation. The ice sheet advanced into the basin now occupied by [[Lake Erie]], stopped for a while, and retreated to the north, leaving behind a [[moraine]]. This [[moraine]] marks the terminus of the episode of ice advance, consists of clay, sand, and gravel, and eventually became the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to [[longshore drift]].<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/><ref name="trail of geology">{{cite web|url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/parkguides/Pg21.pdf |title = Pennsylvania Trail of Geology - Presque Isle State Park, Erie County: A Dynamic Interface of Water and Land |format = PDF |accessdate = 2007-12-11 |author = John G.

As noted, the name ''presque-isle'' literally means "almost an island" in French. In fact, Presque Isle has been an island rather than a peninsula for brief periods.<ref name="wildlife"/>  It has been cut off from the mainland four times since 1819, the longest stretch being the 32 years from 1832 to 1864, and each time the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] has  reconnected it.<ref name="wildlife">{{cite web| url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/STATEPARKS/parks/presqueisle_wildlife.aspx| title = Presque Isle State Park - Wildlife | accessdate=2007-09-11| publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}</ref>

The peninsula was breached five times between 1917 and 1922, the year after Presque Isle became a state park. While repair efforts then included plugging the breach with bales of hay and wood, in the 1950s a state and federal program built a concrete [[seawall]].<ref name="times gull point"/> Fifty-eight breakwaters, built by 1992 to slow [[erosion]], have "captured" the sand and significantly slowed its movement eastward. Even with the breakwaters, new sand has to be brought in annually to [[beach nourishment|replenish]] the beaches.<ref>{{cite news |last=Guerriero |first=John |title=Beaches replenished |date=September 21, 2007 |work=Erie Times-News |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007709210373 |accessdate=October 15, 2007}}</ref>

Presque Isle protects the natural Presque Isle Bay, which creates a deep and wide harbor for the city of Erie. The bay is often filled with [[pleasure craft]] as well as cargo ships from all over the world that use the [[Great Lakes]] shipping port.<ref name="dcnr"/> Erie became an international port after the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959.

The highest recorded temperature at the park was {{convert|100|F}} in 1988, and the record low was {{convert|-18|F}} in 1994.<ref name= "WeatherChannel"/> As of 2007, Erie is 13th on the list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging {{convert|88|in|cm}}.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cappella |first=Chris |date=October 3, 2003 |work=[[USA Today]] |url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/2003-10-01-snowiest-cities_x.htm |title=10 snowiest 'cities' aren't all in New York |accessdate=May 21, 2007}}</ref> For the winter of 2007<U+2013>2008, Erie received {{convert|118.7|in|cm}} of snow with the first snow of the season falling on November 6.<ref>{{cite news| last=Rhodes |first=Kara |work=Erie Times-News |date=March 29, 2008 |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080329/NEWS02/803290373/-1/RSS01 |title=Winter marches on |accessdate=April 14, 2008}}</ref>

== Flora, fauna, and habitat ==
[[File:PresqueIsleBay-lookingN.JPG|thumb|left|The shore on the bay side, looking north|alt=A shoreline from the water with a thin beach and flanked by green trees.]]
=== Ecological zones and succession ===
According to the DCNR, because it has so "many unique habitats, Presque Isle contains a greater number of the state's endangered, threatened and rare species than any other area of comparable size in Pennsylvania."<ref name="dcnr"/> The DCNR recognizes seven different ecological zones within Presque Isle State Park, each with a different plant and animal community. These zones are: Lake Erie; the bay and shoreline; sandy plain and new ponds; sand dunes and ridges; [[marsh]]es and old ponds; thicket and sub-climax forest; and [[climax vegetation|climax forest]].<ref name="wildlife"/> Lake Erie, which surrounds the park, is the first zone and is home to 80 species of fish and at least six species of crustaceans.<ref name="wildlife2">{{cite web | url = http://www.presqueisle.org/nature_of_pi.html | title = Nature of Presque Isle | accessdate = 2007-11-15 | publisher = CyberInk, LP|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025050410/http://www.presqueisle.org/nature_of_pi.html |archivedate = October 25, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="birds">{{cite web | url = http://www.innvista.com/science/ecology/parks/presque.htm | title = Presque Isle State Park | accessdate = 2007-11-17 | publisher = Inn Vista}} ''Note'': the information on flora and fauna here is provided by "David Rutkowski, Assistant Park Manager, Presque Isle State Park".</ref>

The remaining ecological zones, with their progression from shoreline to climax forest, are a classic illustration of the concept of [[ecological succession]]. Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes. The shoreline, the second zone, is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline. The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/> The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of [[Odonata]] (dragonflies and damselflies) and [[Lepidoptera]], including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/><ref name="wildlife2"/>

[[File:Dendroica-cerulea-002.jpg|thumb|The Cerulean Warbler is a rare species found in the park.|alt=A blue and white bird perched on stick.]]
Sand dunes and ridges are the fourth zone, formed when beach sand transported by wind and waves becomes  trapped by vegetation. Dunes grow and are stabilized by grasses, followed by other types of vegetation. This  provides habitat for amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Old dunes can become more permanent ridges, which shelter ponds. These dunes, ridges, and ponds are often remnants of previous shorelines; at the Presque Isle State Park "Long Pond" just east of the marina, dunes and ridges mark the eastern shoreline from 1862.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/> The fifth ecological zone consists of old ponds and marshes. Ponds protected by dunes and ridges are more stable; these old ponds support more plant and animal life, and as they fill with vegetation, they become marshes. Old ponds and marshes have high [[biodiversity]].<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/> Nearly 400 species of terrestrial vertebrates live on Presque Isle, including 318 different birds, 48 kinds of mammals, 13 types of amphibians, and 19 reptile species.<ref name="wildlife2"/>

The sixth and seventh ecological zones are characterized by their shrubs and trees, and Presque Isle State Park is home to 633 plant species (195 [[Monocotyledon]]s, 410 [[Dicotyledon]]s, 5 [[Gymnosperm]]s, 5 [[Horsetail]]s, 13 [[Fern]]s, and 5 [[Moss]]es).<ref name="wildlife2"/> The sixth zone, thicket and sub-climax forest, forms when shrubs grow on dying marshes, followed by small trees. The trees shade and thin out the thickets of shrubs, leading to a sub-climax forest. The seventh and final stage is climax forest, where many large trees form a [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. If left undisturbed, this ecological succession is believed to take 600 or more years, although visitors to parts of Presque Isle State Park can walk through all of these zones in {{convert|5|mi}}.<ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/>

The Pennsylvania [[Audubon Society]] has listed the park as Pennsylvania [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) #1, and it has been rated by ''Birder's World'' magazine as one the best places in the United States for birdwatching.<ref name="wildlife"/><ref>{{cite web|url = http://pa.audubon.org/Sites/Site1.pdf | title = Pennsylvania Important Bird Areas: Site Name Presque Isle State Park |publisher = Pennsylvania Audubon Society | format = PDF |accessdate = 2008-05-03|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050827000310/http://pa.audubon.org/Sites/Site1.pdf |archivedate = August 27, 2005|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The diversity of [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] on the peninsula makes it an ideal home for over 320 species of birds. (For comparison, the United States has about 925 bird species.) Forty-five of the bird species found in the park are listed as "[[endangered]]" or "threatened", including the [[Piping Plover]], [[Cerulean Warbler]], [[Rusty Blackbird]] and [[Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrow]].<ref name="times gull point"/><ref name="wildlife2"/> [[Waterfowl]] and [[wader|wading birds]] live at Presque Isle year round. Four species of [[gull]] and three species of [[tern]] can be seen at Gull Point during the summer months. The majority of collection during the annual [[Christmas Bird Count]], which has been held in Erie County since 1956, is garnered from observations made by volunteers within the park.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bruce |first=David |title=Christmas Bird Count to Begin At Presque Isle |work=Erie Times-News |date=December 14, 2007}}</ref> Many different [[species]] of plants and animals can also be found at Presque Isle State Park due to the wide variety of ecological zones.<ref name="gullpoint"/>

=== Gull Point Natural Area ===
Human beings have played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is hindered or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.<ref name="dcnr"/><ref name="Origin of Presque Isle"/>

[[File:PresqueIsleStatePark.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of Gull Point and Presque Isle State Park from the east.|alt=An aerial view of the green and sandy end of a peninsula.]]
Gull Point at Presque Isle State Park has been set aside as a Pennsylvania "State Park Natural Area". These areas provide locations for scientific observation of natural systems; they protect examples of natural interest and beauty as well as examples of unique and typical animal and plant habitats.<ref name="gullpoint"/><ref name="natural areas"/>

Gull Point covers {{convert|319|acre}}, of which {{convert|67|acre}} form the Natural Area and are closed to park visitors during the height of the bird migrations. The natural area is a safe haven and resting spot for migrating and nesting birds. Many of the species of birds that rest at Gull Point are not seen anywhere else in Pennsylvania.<ref name="gullpoint"/> Presque Isle lies on the [[Atlantic Flyway]], a major migratory path, and some of these birds migrate from as far north as the [[Arctic Circle]] to South America. They pass through in November on their long flights south and return in April on their flights north.<ref name="gullpoint"/>

Erosion and deposition of sand, which has formed Gull Point, continues to change it. From May 1991 to October 2006, Gull Point lost a total of {{convert|4.6|acre}}, and if this trend continues, it may become an island. After the breakwaters were constructed in 1992, less sand was added to replenish the beaches. Federal funding of sand replenishment has been cut off since 2005, leading to further reduction in sand added to the peninsula. Without new sand, erosion has reduced the northern beaches of Gull Point, even while regions to the east and south have continued to grow at a slower rate, for a net yearly loss of {{convert|0.4|acre}}.<ref name="times gull point"/>
