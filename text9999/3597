'''Geoffroy's Spider Monkey''', ''Ateles geoffroyi'', also known as '''Black-handed Spider Monkey''',<ref name=pic/> is a species of [[spider monkey]], a type of [[New World monkey]], from [[Central America]], parts of [[Mexico]] and possibly a small portion of [[Colombia]].  There are at least five subspecies.  Some primatologists classify the [[Black-headed Spider Monkey]], ''A. fusciceps'', found in Panama, Colombia and [[Ecuador]] as the same species as Geoffroy's Spider Monkey.

It is one of the largest New World monkeys, often weighing as much as 9&nbsp;kilograms.  Its arms are significantly longer than its legs, and it has a [[prehensile]] tail that can support the entire weight of the monkey and that is used as an extra limb.  Its hands have only a vestigial thumb, but long, strong hook-like fingers.  These adaptations allow the monkey to move by swinging by its arms beneath the tree branches.

Geoffroy's Spider Monkey lives in [[fission<U+2013>fusion societies]] that contain between 20 and 42 members.  Its diet consists primarily of ripe fruit and it requires large tracts of forest to survive.  As a result of habitat loss, hunting and capture for the pet trade, it is considered to be endangered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).

[[Image:03-04GeofSpiderMonkeysCostaRica2.jpg|thumb|left|Wild Nicaraguan Spider Monkeys (''Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi''), Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica.]]
Geoffroy's Spider Monkey belongs to the New World monkey family [[Atelidae]], which contains the [[spider monkey]]s, [[woolly monkey]]s, [[muriqui]]s and [[howler monkey]]s. It is a member of the subfamily [[Atelinae]], which includes the spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis, and of the genus ''[[Ateles]]'', which contains all the spider monkeys.<ref name=msw3/><ref name=tax/>  The genus name ''Ateles'' means "imperfect", a reference to the vestigial thumb.<ref>{{cite book|title=Spider Monkeys|editor=Campbell, C.|chapter=Morphology and evolution of the spider monkey, genus ''Ateles''|author=Rosenberger, A., Halenar, L., Cooke, S. & Hartwig, W.|year=2008|page=19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86750-4}}</ref>  The species name ''geoffroyi'' is in honor of French naturalist [[<U+00C9>tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]].

There are at least five recognized subspecies of this monkey:<ref name=msw3/>

Some authorities also recognize ''Ateles geoffroyi azuerensis'' and ''Ateles geoffroyi frontatus'' as valid subspecies.<ref name=iucn/>  The [[Black-headed Spider Monkey]], ''Ateles fusciceps'' is considered by authorities such as [[Colin Groves|Groves]] (1989) and Rylands et al (2006) to be a separate species from Geoffroy's Spider Monkey.<ref name=msw3/><ref name=tax3>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Taxonomy and Distributions of Mesoamerican Primates|author=Rylands, A., Groves, C., Mittermeier, R., Cortes-Ortiz, L., and Hines, J.|editor = Estrada, A., Garber, P., Pavelka, M. & Luecke, L.|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=0-387-25854-X|pages=67<U+2013>69}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=South American Primates|editor=Garber, P., Estrada, A., Bicca-Marqyes, J.C., Heymann, E. & Streier, K|chapter=The Diversity of the New World Primates|author=Rylands, A. & Mittermeier, R.|page=44|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-78704-6}}</ref>  Other authorities, including Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), condider ''A. fusciceps'' to be synonymous with ''A. geoffroyi''.<ref name=spidertax>{{cite book|title=Spider Monkeys|editor=Campbell, C.|chapter=The taxonomic status of spider monkeys in the twenty-first century|author=Collins, A.|year=2008|pages=50<U+2013>72|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86750-4}}</ref>  Under this treatment, the two subspecies of the Black-headed Spider Monkey represent additional subspecies of Geoffroy's Spider Monkey, ''[[Ateles fusciceps fusciceps|A. g. fusciceps]]'' and ''[[Ateles fusciceps rufiventris|A. g. rufiventris]]''.<ref name=spidertax/>

[[Mitochondrial DNA]] studies by Collins and Daubach (2000, 2001, 2006) indicate that Geoffroy's Spider Monkey is more closely related to the [[White-fronted Spider Monkey]], ''A. belzebuth'', and the [[Brown Spider Monkey]], ''A. hybridus'', than it is to the [[Red-faced Spider Monkey]], ''A. paniscus''.  According to these studies, ''A. paniscus'' branched off from the other spider monkeys approximately 3.27 million years ago and the spider monkeys branched off from the woolly monkeys and muiriquis 3.59 million years ago.  Older studies by Porter, et al indicate that the howler monkeys are believed to have branced off from the other Atelides over 10 million years ago.<ref name=spidertax/>

The range of Geoffroy's Spider Monkey extends over much of Central America, encompassing [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Belize]] and the south and much of the eastern portion of [[Mexico]].<ref name=tax>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Taxonomy and Distributions of Mesoamerican Primates|author=Rylands, A., Groves, C., Mittermeier, R., Cortes-Ortiz, L., and Hines, J.|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-25854-X|pages=56<U+2013>66}}</ref>  Observations by local people indicate that the southernmost subspecies, the [[Hooded Spider Monkey]], ''Ateles geoffroyi grisescens'', may also occur in the portion of [[Colombia]] near the Panama border.<ref name=tax/><ref name=iucn2>{{IUCN2007|assessors=Ryland, A. et al.|year=2000|id=2287|title=Ateles geoffroyi ''ssp.'' grisescens |downloaded=[[2008-08-30]]}}</ref>  In western Colombia and northeast Panama it is replaced by the [[Black-headed Spider Monkey]], ''A. fusciceps'', which is considered by some primatologists to be a subspecies of Geoffroy's Spider Monkey.<ref name=tax/><ref name=spidertax/>

Geoffroy's Spider Monkey lives in various types of forest including [[rainforest]]s, semi-deciduous forests and [[mangrove]] forests.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Black-Handed Spider Monkey|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/310.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>  Higher densities of Geoffroy's Spider Monkeys are generally found in areas containing evergreen forest.<ref>{{cite book | author = DeGama, H. and Fedigan, L. | editor = Estrada, A., Garber, P., Pavelka, M. * Luecke, L.|location=New York|chapter = The Effects of Forest Fragment Age, Isolation, Size, Habitat Type, and Water Availability on Monkey Density in a Tropical Dry Forest | title = New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0-387-25854-6 | year = 2006| pages = 165<U+2013>186}}</ref>

==Behavior==
Geoffroy's Spider Monkey is [[arboreal]] and [[Diurnality|diurnal]], and mostly inhabits the upper portion of the forest.<ref name=neo/><ref name=watch/><ref name=costa/> However, it comes to the ground more frequently than other spider monkey species.<ref name=spiderloc>{{cite book|title=Spider Monkeys|editor=Campbell, C.|chapter=Locomotion and positional behavior|author=Youlatos, D.|pages=185<U+2013>214|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86750-4}}</ref>  It lives in [[fission<U+2013>fusion societies]] large groups with a typical group size of 20 to 42 members which split into smaller subgroups to forage during the day.<ref name=perspective/><ref name=sussman>{{cite book|title=Primate Ecology and Social Structure Volume 2: New World Monkeys|edition=Revised First Edition|author=Sussman, R.|year=2003|publisher=Pearson Custom Publishing|isbn=0-536-74364-9|pages=138<U+2013>142}}</ref><ref name=pic/><ref name=costa/>  Subgroups typically number two to six members, and sometimes the subgroups remain separate from the main group even through the night.<ref name=costa/>

Geoffroy's Spider Monkey forages over large tracts of forest in search of food.

[[Image:Geoffroy Spider Monkey Hand 1.jpg|thumb|right|The thumbless hands are useful for [[brachiation]].]]
In addition to walking or running on four limbs and climbing, Geoffroy's Spider Monkey uses several forms of suspensory locomotion.  [[Brachiation]], or swinging from the arms with assistance from the prehensile tail, is the most common form of suspensory locomotion. Less common forms include swinging while suspended by the tail, and walking on four limbs under a branch.  Studies have indicated that Geoffroy's Spider Monkey uses suspensory locomotion less frequently than other spider monkey species.<ref name=spiderloc/>

The most common method used by spider monkeys to cross between trees is "bridging", in which the monkey grasps for a branch from the new tree and pulls it towards itself so that it can climb onto it.  Airborne leaps are used when necessary, and certain populations of Geoffroy's Spider Monkey, especially in Panama, are known to leap between trees more frequently than other populations.<ref name=spiderloc/>

When not moving, Geoffroy's Spider Monkey uses not only suppoted postures, such as sitting or standing, but also suspended postures in which it hangs from a branch.  Suspended postures always include support from the tail, and sometimes the monkey hangs by its tail alone.  Other times the monkey hangs by the tail and by one or more limbs simultaneously.  Studies have indicated that at least some Geoffroy's Spider Monkey populations use suspended postures less frequently when feeding than other spider monkey species.<ref name=spiderloc/>

===Communication and intelligence===
Sounds produced by Geoffroy's Spider Monkey include barks, whinnies, squeals, squeaks and screams.<ref name=pic/><ref name=neo/><ref name=costa/>  Barks are typically alarm calls.<ref name=costa/>  Whinnies and screams can be used as distress calls, and are also made at dawn and at dusk.<ref name=costa/> Each monkey makes a unique sound, which may allow monkeys to recognize each other through vocal communication alone.<ref name=costa/>  Several researchers have investigated the use of whinnies, which consist of between two and twelve quick increases and decreases in pitch, in more detail.<ref name=spidercom/>  This research has indicated that one additional purpose of whinnies is to call other group members to a food source.<ref name=spidercom>{{cite book|title=Spider Monkeys|editor=Campbell, C.|chapter=Communication|author=Ramos-Fernandez, G.|pages=224<U+2013>229|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86750-4}}</ref>  Other purposes of whinnies suggested by this research have included maintaining vocal contact with other group members while traveling and distinguishing between group members and members of other groups.<ref name=spidercom/>

Geoffroy's Spider Monkey uses several forms of non-vocal communication.  A curled tail or arched back can be used as a threat display towards other spider monkeys.  A head shake is used either as a threat or an invitation to play.  Shaking branches or swaying arms is used as a warning of danger to the group.<ref name=colombia/>

Although they do not use tools, spider monkeys, including Geoffroy's Spider Monkey, are regarded as intelligent primates.  A study performed in 2007 concluded that spider monkeys were the third most intelligent non-human primate, behind only [[orang-utan]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, and ahead of [[gorilla]]s and all other monkeys.<ref name=intelligence>{{cite web|title=Chimps Knocked Off Top of the IQ Tree|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1654998.ece|author=Leake, D. & Dobson, R.|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=April 15, 2007|year=2007|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>  This mental capacity may be an adaptation to spider monkeys' [[frugivore|frugivorous]] diets, which require them to be able to identify and memorize many different types of foods and their locations.<ref name=mach>{{cite book|title=Machiavellian intelligence: social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans|author=Byrne, R. & Whiten, A.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=unlEuP-GgmoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false|pages=289<U+2013>294|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198521754}}</ref>

===Diet and predators===
[[Image:Ateles-geoffroyi 48090599.jpg|thumb|right|The prehensile tail can be useful when feeding.]]
Geoffroy's Spider Monkey eats mostly fruit <U+2013> preferably ripe and fleshy <U+2013> and spends 70% to 80% of its feeding time eating fruit.  Leaves make up most of the rest of its diet.  Young leaves are especially important to provide protein that can be lacking in fruit.  Other elements of its diet include flowers, bark, insects, honey, seeds and buds.<ref name=costa/><ref name=henderson>{{cite book|title=Field Guide to the Wildlife of Costa Rica|author=Henderson, C.|pages=452<U+2013>454|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292734593}}</ref>  

In addition to providing much of the monkey's nutritional needs, fruit and leaves provide much of its water requirements.<ref name=spiderdiet>{{cite book|title=Spider Monkeys|editor=Campbell, C.|chapter=Diets of wild spider monkeys|author=Di Fiore, A., Link, A. & Dew, J.L.|year=2008|page=82|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86750-4}}</ref> Like other spider monkeys, Geoffroy's Spider Monkey drinks water from tree holes and [[bromeliads]] in trees but unlike other spider monkeys, it also drinks from terrestrial water sources.<ref name=spiderdiet/>

Large cats <U+2013> [[jaguar]]s and [[Cougar|pumas]] <U+2013> appear to be the only significant adult spider monkey predators, other than humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Matsuda|first=I.|coauthors=Izawa, K.|year=2008|title=Predation of wild spider monkeys at La Macarena, Colombia|journal=Primate|volume=49|issue=1|pages=63-68|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k81437kp74307841/|doi=10.1007/s10329-007-0042-5}}</ref>  [[Eagle]]s and large [[snake]]s are also potential predators.<ref name=PrimateInfoNet>{{cite web |last = Cawthon Lang |first = KA |date = 2005-04-10 |title = Primate Factsheets: Black spider monkey (''Ateles paniscus'') |publisher = Wisconsin Primate Research Center (WPRC) |url = http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/black_spider_monkey/taxon |accessdate = 2008-08-29}}</ref>  However, predation of Geoffroy's Spider Monkey has not been observed by researchers.<ref name=colombia/>

===Life cycle===
Female Geoffroy's Spider Monkeys bear young every two to four years.<ref name=neo/>  Among males, mating is not restricted to only dominant individuals.  In one study at [[Barro Colorado Island]], all males in the group were observed mating at least once over a one year period.  However, it appears that dominant males mate more often than low ranking males.  It is unknown whether male dominance is correlated with greater success in fathering offspring.<ref name=spidersex/>

Geoffroy's Spider Monkeys mate in a sitting position, both facing the same direction, with the male seated behind the female and his arms wrapped around her chest and legs wrapped around her waist.<ref name=pic/><ref name=costa/>  This embrace can last between 8&nbsp;and&nbsp;22&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=costa/>  Prior to mating, the male and female both separate themselves from the rest of the group, so that they are alone except for any of the female's juvenile offspring.<ref name=spidersex/>

The [[gestation|gestational period]] is about 7.5&nbsp;months, after which a single young is typically born, although twins sometimes occur.<ref name=spidersex/>  The young are dark in color until they begin taking on the adult coloration at the age of five months.  They are carried on their mothers' chest for the first month and a half to two months, at which point they can ride on her back.  They nurse until they are about one year old, but begin eating solid foods and moving independently at about three months.  Even when they move independently, they cannot always cross gaps in the canopy that adults can manage.  To help them, an adult will stretch across the gap, forming a bridge that the young can cross.<ref name=costa/>  

Females become sexually mature at about four years; males at about five years.  Upon reaching sexual maturity, females leave their natal group but males do not.  As a result, the males in the groups are typically related while the females are not.  This may help explain why male Geoffroy's Spider Monkeys form strong bonds.  Maximum life span in the wild is unknown.  In captivity, Geoffroy's Spider Monkey can live at least 33&nbsp;years old.<ref name=costa/>

==Conservation==
Geoffroy's Spider Monkey is listed as "Endangered" by the [[IUCN]], mostly due to habitat loss.<ref name=iucn/> It requires large tracts of primary forest to survive, and so it is vulnerable to deforestation and it is sometimes hunted by humans and captured for the pet trade.<ref name=costa/>  Because of its low reproductive turnover, it cannot quickly replenish its numbers when impacted by these events.<ref name=costa/>  As a result, Geoffroy's Spider Monkey has disappeared from some areas where it was once common.<ref name=costa/>  Three subspecies are critically endangered.<ref name=iucn3>{{IUCN2008|assessors=Cuar<U+00F3>n, A.D., Morales, A., Shedden, A., Rodriguez-Luna, E. & de Grammont, P.C.|year=2008|id=39923|title=Ateles geoffroyi ''ssp.'' vellerosus|downloaded=[[2009-02-01]]}}</ref><ref name=iucn4>{{IUCN2008|assessors=Cuar<U+00F3>n, A.D., Morales, A., Shedden, A., Rodriguez-Luna, E. & de Grammont, P.C.|year=2008|id=2286|title=Ateles geoffroyi ''ssp.'' azuerensis|downloaded=[[2009-02-01]]}}</ref><ref name=iucn5>{{IUCN2008|assessors=Cuar<U+00F3>n, A.D., Shedden, A., Rodr<U+00ED>guez-Luna, E., de Grammont, P.C. & Link, A.|year=2008|id=43901|title=Ateles geoffroyi ''ssp.'' geoffroyi|downloaded=[[2009-02-01]]}}</ref>

One area where Geoffroy's Spider Monkey was eliminated was [[Barro Colorado Island]] in [[Panama]]. Hunting had eliminated the native population there by 1912. However, between 1959 and 1966 an effort was made to reintroduce the species to Barro Colorado.  At least 18 monkeys were reintroduced but only five, one male and four females, survived the reintroduction.  This small group has thrived, and the island population had grown to 28 monkeys by 2003.<ref name=tax2>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Spider Monkey Population on Barro Colorado Island, Panama|author=Milton, K. & Hopkins, M.|editor = Estrada, A., Garber, P., Pavelka, M. & Luecke, L.|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=0-387-25854-X|pages=417<U+2013>436}}</ref>
