'''Horton Plains National Park''' ({{lang-si|<U+0DC4><U+0DDD><U+0DA7><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0DAD><U+0DD0><U+0DB1><U+0DCA><U+0DB1>}}) is a [[Protected areas of Sri Lanka|protected area]] in the central highlands of [[Sri Lanka]] and is covered by montane grassland and [[cloud forest]]. This plateau at an altitude of {{convert|2100|-|2300|m|ft}} is rich in [[biodiversity]] and many species found here are [[endemism|endemic]] to the region. This region was designated a [[national park]] in 1988. It is also a popular tourist destination and is situated {{convert|32|km|mi}} from [[Nuwara Eliya]]. 

The Horton Plains are the [[Source (river or stream)|headwaters]] of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the [[Mahaweli River|Mahaweli]], [[Kelani River|Kelani]], and [[Walawe River|Walawe]]. In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] the plains are known as Mahaweli Plains. [[Stone tool]]s dating back to [[Balangoda Man|Balangoda culture]] have been found here. The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest, and includes many endemic [[woody plant]]s. Large herds of [[Sri Lankan Sambar Deer]] feature as typical mammals, and the park is also an [[Important Bird Area]] with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. [[Forest dieback]] is one of the major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a natural phenomenon. The sheer precipice of World's End and [[Baker's Falls]] are among the tourist attractions of the park.

==Physical features==
Horton Plains is located on the southern plateau of the central highlands of Sri Lanka.<ref name="iwmi">{{cite web|url=http://dw.iwmi.org/wetland_profile/Horton.asp|title=Horton Plains National Park|publisher=[[International Water Management Institute]]|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> The peaks of Kirigalpotta ({{convert|2389|m|ft}}) and Thotapolakanda ({{convert|2357|m|ft}}), the second and the third highest of Sri Lanka, are situated to the west and north respectively.

The mean annual rainfall is greater than {{convert|2000|mm|in}}. Frequent cloudy cover limits the amount of sunlight that is available to plants. The mean annual temperature is {{convert|13|C|F}} but the temperature varies considerably during the course of a day, reaching as high as {{convert|27|C|F}} during the day time, and dipping as low as {{convert|5|C|F}} at night. During the [[Monsoon|southwest Monsoon]] season, the wind speed sometimes reaches [[Beaufort scale|gale force]]. Although some rain falls throughout the year, a dry season occurs from January-March.

==History==
The park is named after [[Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton, 3rd Baronet|Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton]], the [[British governors of Ceylon|British governor of Ceylon]] from 1831 to 1837, who travelled to the area to meet the Ratemahatmaya of Sabaragamuwa in 1836.<ref name="green" /> [[Stone tool]]s dating back to [[Balangoda Man|Balangoda culture]] have been found here. The local population who resided in the lowlands ascended the mountains to mine gems, extract [[iron ore]], construct [[irrigation]]al [[canal]] and fell trees for timber. A {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} [[pollen core]] extracted from a mire revealed that in the late [[quaternary]] period the area had a semi-arid climate and a species-restricted plant community.<ref name="Premathilake 2003">{{cite journal|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=14883972|title=Late Quaternary climate history of the Horton Plains, central Sri Lanka|last=Premathilake|first=Rathnasiri|coauthors=Risberg, Jan|date=2003|journal=Quaternary science reviews|volume=22| issue=14 |pages=1525<U+2013>1541|doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(03)00128-8}}</ref> 

Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] had adviced the [[British Ceylon|British Government]] "to leave all Montane Forests above 5000 ft. undisturbed" and an administrative order to this effect had been issued in 1873 that prevented clearing and felling of forests in the region. Horton Plains was designated as a [[Wildlife refuge|wildlife sanctuary]] on 5 December 1969,<ref name="green">{{cite book|last=Green|first=Michael J. B.|title=IUCN directory of South Asian protected areas|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]|date=1990|pages=216<U+2013>219|chapter=Horton Plains National Park|isbn=2831700302|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bs_t9aOtIk0C&pg=PA218&dq=horton+plains+national+park#v=onepage&q=horton%20plains%20national%20park&f=false}}</ref> and because of its biodiversity value, was elevated to a [[national park]] on 18 March 1988. The [[Peak Wilderness Sanctuary]] which lies in west is contiguous with the park. The land area covered by Horton Plains is {{convert|3160|ha|mi2}}. Horton Plains contains the most extensive area of  cloud forest still existing in Sri Lanka.<ref name="green" />

Horton Plains National Park along with Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and [[Knuckles Mountain Range]] is currently on a tentative list of potential [[World Heritage Site]]s.<ref name="unesco.org">{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1728/|title=Peak Wilderness Sanctuary (PWS), Horton Plains National Park (HPNP), Knuckles Range (KR)|date=2009|work=unesco.org|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> They are listed under mixed (both natural and cultural) category of selection.<ref name="unesco.org" />

==Flora==
[[File:Hortanplain2.jpg|thumb|alt= shrubs with pink flowers|''[[Rhododendron arboreum]]'' is the predominant tree species in the park]]
The vegetation of the park is classified into two distinctive groups, {{convert|2000|ha|mi2}} of wet ''patana'' (Sinhalese for "montane [[grassland]]s") and {{convert|1160|ha|mi2}} of subtropical montane evergreen forests.<ref name="iwmi" /> Nearly 750 species of plants belonging to 20 families have been recorded from the park. The forest [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] reaches the height of {{convert|20|m|ft}} and features ''[[Calophyllum walkeri]]'', forming communities with varieties of [[Myrtaceae]] species such as ''[[Syzygium rotundifolium]]'', and ''S. sclerophyllum'', and [[Lauraceae]] members including ''[[Litsea]]'', ''[[Cinnamomum]]'', and ''Actinodaphne speciosa''.<ref name="green" /> The [[undergrowth]] layer is characterised  by ''[[Strobilanthes]]'' spp. The thickness of the ''Strobilanthes'' vegetation hinders the development of a herb layer. Dwarf bamboo species such ''[[Indocalamus]]'' and ''[[Ochlandra]]'' also found in the undergrowth layer. ''[[Rhodomyrtus tomentosa]]'' bushes specially grow in forest margin and near the mountain peaks. Species such as ''[[Gordonia]]'' and ''[[Rhododendron arboreum]]'' have spread to Sri Lanka, along the [[Western Ghats]] of [[South India]] from the [[Himalayas]] and are now common. Nearly 54 [[woody plant]] species have been recorded from the park, of which 27 (50%) are endemic to Sri Lanka.<ref name="green" />

[[File:SLz30horton.jpg|left|thumb|alt= grassland with a prominent mountain peak in the far distance|[[Adam's Peak]] seen across the grasslands of the park]]
Frequent fire and [[grazing]] characterises [[Plagio climax community|Plagioclimax communities]] of the grassland flora.<ref name="iwmi" /> Grasslands are dominated by ''Arundinella villosa'' and ''Chrysopogon zeylanicus''. Waterlogged [[swamp]]s or slow moving streams are found in low lying areas, and [[macrophyte]]s such as ''Aponogeton jacobsenii'', [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] species ''Isolopis fluitans'' and ''[[Utricularia]]'' spp. are found near the slow moving streams. The [[bamboo]] ''Chimonobambusa densifolia''  thrive along the banks of the streams, and near the swampy areas grass species such as ''Juncus prismatocarpus'', ''Garnotia mutica'', ''[[Eriocaulon]]'' spp. and ''Exacum trinervium'' are common. [[Tussock (grass)|Tussock grasses]] such as ''Chrysopogon zeylanicus'' and ''Cymbopogon confertiflorus'' are found in the wet hollows.<ref name="green" /> [[Herbaceous plant|Herbaceous flora]] of the grasslands include temperate species including ''[[Ranunculus]]'', ''[[Pedicularis]]'', ''[[Senecio]]'', ''[[Gentiana]]'' and ''[[Alchemilla]]'' and also tropical species such as ''[[Eriocaulon]]'' and ''Ipsea speciosa'' (a rare endemic daffodil orchid). The most widespread [[Taiga|boreal]] herbaceous plants of the park are ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'', ''[[Lobelia]]'', ''[[Gaultheria]]'', ''[[Fragaria]]'', and ''[[Plantago]]''.<ref name="Campbell 1926">{{cite book|last=[[Douglas Houghton Campbell|Campbell, Douglas Houghton]]|title=An outline of plant geography| publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|location=New York | date=1926 | pages= 191 | chapter=Ceylon|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/outlineofplantge00camp#page/190/mode/2up/search/Horton}}</ref>

Hanging [[lichen]]s such as ''[[Usnea barbata]]'' are also common.<ref name="Senaratna 2009" /> A number of [[fern]]s and [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] can be seen in the park. About 16 of the orchid species being endemic. Other notable plants include shrubs such as ''[[Rhodomyrtus tomentosa]]'', ''[[Gaultheria fragrantissima]]'', herbs, ''[[Exacum trinervium]]'', ''E. walkeri'', ''[[Drosera indica]]'', and [[Cyatheales|tree fern]]s ''[[Cyathea]]'' spp.<ref name="iwmi" /> ''[[Anzia]]'', a foliose lichen genus belonging to [[Parmeliaceae]] family, which had not been recorded in Sri Lanka previously, was discovered here in 2007.<ref name="Jayalal 2007" /> There are conflicting views on how the grasslands of the park came into being, whether man-made or natural. It is now believed that the grasslands on the dry slopes were created by forest clearance and fires while grasslands in low lying areas were naturally created by wet conditions, [[frost]] and [[Erosion|soil erosion]].<ref name="green" />

==Threats and conservation management==
Horton Plains was a part of a large system of plains and forest cover that included Agra-Bopats, Moon Plains and Elk Plains.<ref name="green" /> Between 1831 and 1948, it became a Sambar deer hunting ground. Elephants and Wild Boar were also hunted to a lesser extent. During this period lower slopes were cleared initially for coffee and then for [[tea production in Sri Lanka|tea plantations]]. As a result, Horton Plains and Peak Wilderness became isolated from other forest and grassland areas. Potatoes were cultivated in the grasslands but planting ceased in 1977. After being declared a National Park, these areas were reinstated as grasslands. Tourism-related issues such as plant removal, littering, [[Wildfire|fires]] and noise pollution are major conservation issues.<ref name="iwmi" /> Gem mining, [[Illegal logging|timber logging]], the collection of plants for ornamental and [[herbalism|medicinal]] purposes, encroachment, [[poaching]] and vehicle traffic are the other threats. The spread of [[Invasive species|invasive]] alien species such as Gorse (''[[Ulex europaeus]]''), [[bracken]]s, and ''[[Pennisetum]]'' spp. threaten the native flora. The introduced rainbow trout may have affected endemic species of fish, amphibia and crustaceans.<ref name=green/> 

Some Sambar deer have died due to eating polythene litter that blocked their food passages, and visitors are banned from bringing polythene into the park.<ref name="Fernando 2002">{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/04/21/fea11.html|title=Horton Plains : Nature's pristine glory|last=Fernando|first=Vimukthi|date=21 April 2002|work=Sunday Observer|accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> Sambar have benefited from the introduced ''Pennisetum'' grass species.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1703.2003.00595.x|title=Food habits of sambar Cervus unicolor at the Horton Plains National Park, Sri Lanka|year=2003|last1=Padmalal|first1=U.K.G.K.|last2=Takatsuki|first2=Seiki|last3=Jayasekara|first3=Palitha|journal=Ecological Research|volume=18|pages=775}}</ref>

A recent threat, first reported in 1978, is [[forest dieback]].<ref name="green" /> In some areas, especially in the peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as the main cause of dieback as [[drought]]s are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with ''[[Calophyllum walkeri]]'' being the most affected.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02432929|title=Canopy dieback in the upper montane rain forests of Sri Lanka|year=1988|last1=Werner|first1=Wolfgang L.|journal=GeoJournal|volume=17|pages=245}}</ref> A study has suggested that low Calcium causes [[soil acidification]] and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as Aluminium may be causing the dieback. [[Leaching (pedology)|Leaching]] of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil [[micronutrient]]s may also be contributing to the dieback.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00254-008-1278-0|title=Major and trace elements in plants and soils in Horton Plains National Park, Sri Lanka: an approach to explain forest die back|year=2008| last1=Chandrajith|first1=Rohana| last2=Koralegedara|first2=Nadeesha| last3=Ranawana|first3=K.
