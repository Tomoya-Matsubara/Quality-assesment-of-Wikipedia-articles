"Smash Your Enemies" was re-recorded for the 2002 release ''[[Perseverance (Hatebreed album)|Perseverance]]''.

In 2005, "Severed" was re-recorded and added as a bonus track for the UK release of ''[[Supremacy (Hatebreed album)|Supremacy]]''.

"Kill an Addict" and "Filth" were iTunes exclusive tracks for the special edition of Hatebreed's [[Hatebreed (album)|self-titled album]] in 2009. This special edition is no longer available on iTunes.
