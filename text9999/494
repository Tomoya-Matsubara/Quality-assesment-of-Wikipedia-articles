'''Alternative energy''' is an [[umbrella term]] that refers to any source of usable [[energy]] intended to replace fuel sources without the undesired consequences of the replaced fuels<ref>[http://www.icax.co.uk/alternative_energy.html On site renewable energy options]</ref>.  Typically, official uses of the term, such as qualification for governmental incentives, exclude [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear energy]]<ref name=DOI-1> {{cite journal

Over the years, the nature of what was regarded alternative energy sources has changed considerably, and today because of the variety of energy choices and differing goals of their advocates, defining some energy types as "alternative" is highly controversial.

The term "alternative" presupposes a set of undesirable energy technologies against which "alternative energies" are opposed.  As such, the list of energy technologies excluded is an indicator of what problems that the alternative technologies are intended to address.  Controversies regarding dominant forms of energy and their alternatives have a long history. 

==History==
Historians of economies have studied the key transitions to alternative energies and regard the transitions as pivotal in bringing about significant economic change.<ref>{{cite journal

====Coal as an alternative to wood====
Historian [[Norman F. Cantor]] describes how in the late medieval period, coal was the new alternative fuel to save the society from overuse of the dominant fuel, wood:
:"Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 AD they were running short of wood for heating and cooking... By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster, [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of potatoes and maize."<ref>{{cite book

====Petroleum as an alternative to whale oil====
[[Whale oil]] was the dominant form of lubrication and fuel for lamps in the early 19th century, but by mid century and the [[History of whaling|depletion of the whale stocks]], whale oil prices were skyrocketing and could not compete with the newly discovered source of cheap petroleum from [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] in 1859.<ref>{{cite web

====Alcohol as alternative to fossil fuels====
{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
In 1917, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] advocated [[ethanol]] alcohol from corn and other foodstuffs as an alternative to coal and oil, stating that the world was in measurable distance of depleting these fuels.  For Bell, the problem requiring an alternative was lack of renewability of orthodox energy sources<ref>{{cite book

What shall we do when we have no more coal or oil! .... There is, however, one other source of fuel supply which may perhaps this problem of the future.  Alcohol makes a beautiful, clean and efficient fuel, and where not intended for human consumption can be manufactured very cheaply ... from corn stalks and in fact from almost any vegetable matter capable of fermentation.

[[Cellulosic ethanol]] can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks, and involves the use of  the whole crop.  This new approach should increase yields and reduce the [[carbon footprint]] because the amount of energy-intensive fertilisers and fungicides will remain the same, for a higher output of usable material.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5353118.stm Biofuels look to the next generation]</ref><ref name=cellu>[http://www.eesi.org/briefings/2007/Ag%20&%20Energy/2-12-07cellulosic2/2-12-07cellulosic2notice.htm  Cellulosic Ethanol: Not Just Any Liquid Fuel]</ref> As of 2008, there are nine [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercial cellulosic ethanol plants]] which are either operating, or under construction, in the United States.<ref>[http://www.grainnet.com/pdf/cellulosemap.pdf Building Cellulose]</ref>

====Coal gasification as alternative to expensive petroleum====
In the 1970s, President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration advocated [[coal gasification]] as an alternative to expensive imported oil.  The program, including the [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]] was scrapped when petroleum prices plummeted in the 1980s.

====Renewable Energy as alternative to non-renewable energy====
{{Main|Renewable Energy}}
'''Renewable energy''' is [[energy]] generated from [[natural resource]]s&mdash;such as [[sunlight]]<ref>Including [[solar energy|solar]] and [[radiant energy]].</ref>, [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]] and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]]&mdash;which are [[Renewable resource|renewable]] (naturally replenished).

==Recent forms==
====Ecologically friendly alternatives====
[[Renewable energy]] sources such as [[biomass]] are sometimes regarded as an alternative to ecologically harmful fossil fuels.  Renewables are not inherently alternative energies for this purpose.  For example, the [[Netherlands]], once leader in use of [[palm oil]] as a biofuel, has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use "may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels".<ref name=pal>{{cite journal

====Zero carbon alternatives====
From the perspective of the [[climate change]] issue, [[low carbon economy]] fuels are alternative sources that eliminate carbon and methane emissions.  For this goal, renewable or [[sustainable energy|sustainable energies]] such as [[biomass]] combustion, and [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] derived from natural gas do not present viable alternatives because they do not aggressively confront global net carbon increases.  Both [[nuclear power]] and [[carbon capture and storage]] techniques such as [[clean coal technology]] are low carbon emission alternative energy technologies but are reviled by other "alternative energy" advocates who argue that these energies do not provide an alternative to harming the environment.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

====Energy independence alternatives====
In Europe, there is a desire to be more independent of Russia supplied energy<ref> {{cite news

}}</ref>, and in the US, there is a [[United States energy independence|desire to be independent]] from petroleum produced in countries that often are hostile to US interests.  From this perspective, domestic natural gas, a fossil fuel, is an alternative energy to use of foreign petroleum as a transportation fuel. This is the point of view of [[T. Boone Pickens]] as described in his [[Pickens plan]] for energy independence, and is reflected in legislation for the state of [[Florida]]<ref> {{cite web

}} This bill explicitly lists natural gas as an "alternative energy".</ref>.  Although natural gas is not renewable, it is regarded as an alternative energy from this point of view.  

==Alternative energy in transportation==
Due to steadily rising gas prices in 2008 with the US national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas rising above $4.00 at one point,<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/02/news/economy/gas/?postversion=2008070206 Gas Prices post third straight record, CNN Money].</ref> there has been a steady movement towards developing higher fuel efficiency and more [[alternative fuel]] vehicles for consumers. In response, many smaller companies have rapidly increased research and development into radically different ways of powering consumer vehicles.  While Hybrid Vehicles (such as Toyota's Prius) and Electric Vehicles (such as the Tesla Roadster) are commercially available, other technologies such as fuel cells, flywheels, and ultracapacitors are starting to emerge as viable options.<ref>[http://inagreenworld.blogspot.com/2008/07/fill-it-upwith-water.html In A Green World], accessed [[Jul 2]], [[2008]].</ref>
