"'''The Scientist'''" is the seventh single from the [[English people|English]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Coldplay]] and the second single to be released from their second album ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. The song was written collaboratively by all the bandmembers for the album. The song is built around a [[piano]] [[ballad]], with lyrics about a man's desire to love and an apology. The song was released in the [[United Kingdom]] as the second single from ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' and reached number ten in the [[UK Charts]]. It was released in the [[United States]] as the third single, and reached number eighteen on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]].

"The Scientist" received positive reviews. Critics complimented the song's piano ballad and falsetto. Several remixes of the track exist and its riff has been widely [[sampling (music)|sampled]]. The single's [[music video]] won three [[MTV Music Video Awards]], for the video's use of [[Reverse chronology|reverse narrative]]. The song is featured in the band's 2003 [[live album]] ''[[Live 2003]]''.

==Background==
Chris Martin wrote "The Scientist" after listening to [[George Harrison|George Harrison's]] "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1456997/08132002/coldplay.jhtml|title=Coldplay - Going Out of My Head|accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2002-08-13|publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'', he knew that the album was missing something.<ref name="the scientist">{{cite web|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/coldplay/articles/story/7381688/qa_chris_martin|title=Q&A: Chris Martin|accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2005-06-16|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> One night, during a stay in [[Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Oldham|url=http://www.easytoplease.net/interviews.php?page=nz|title=Coldplay Yellow Fever|accessdate=2008-09-02|date=July 2002|work=Auckland, New Zealand Newspaper ([[Internet Archive]])}}</ref> Martin found an old piano, that, according to him, was out of 'tune'.<ref name="the scientist"/> He wanted to work on George Harrison's song "Isn't It a Pity", but he couldn't manage to do so.

Talking about the album, Martin said: "That's just about girls.

However, the inside cover to ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' stated: "The Scientist is Dan."  'Dan' refers to Dan Keeling, the [[A&R]] man who signed the band to Parlophone.<ref name="ezine"/>

===Reception===
Critics were positive towards the song. Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in his review of the album wrote: "While the fantastic piano ballad 'The Scientist' is an overt sequel to 'Yellow' ("Let's go back to the start") with a cataclysmic falsetto finale that could raise every hair on the back of your neck."<ref>{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Sheffield|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/171751/review/5943034/arushofbloodtothehead|title=A Rush Of Blood To The Head|accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2002-08-26|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> Nick Southall of ''[[Stylus (magazine)|Stylus]]'' magazine wrote: "The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than a shrill ringing as is so often the case."<ref>{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Southall|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/coldplay/a-rush-of-blood-to-the-head.htm|title=Coldplay - A Rush Of Blood To The Head Review|accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2002-09-01|work=[[Stylus (magazine)|Stylus]]}}</ref> Ian Watson of ''[[NME]]'' wrote: "'The Scientist' is a song inexorably linked with the endless night sky and the secret hopes and regrets of a hundred thousand strangers."<ref>{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Watson|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/coldplay/6803|title=Coldplay: The Scientist|accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2002-10-31|work=[[NME]]}}</ref>

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "The Scientist" was very popular with its [[Reverse chronology|reverse narrative]]. The same concept was previously used for [[Spike Jonze|Spike Jonze's]] 1996 music video for [[The Pharcyde|The Pharcyde's]] "[[Drop (song)|Drop]]". This reverse style was first seen in the video for the song "[[Bebop Moptop|The Second Summer of Love]]" by Scottish band [[Danny Wilson (band)|Danny Wilson]] in 1989, and can also be seen in [[Enigma]]'s "[[Return to Innocence]]", [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]]'s video for "[[Sitting, Waiting, Wishing]]", [[Dashboard Confessional]]'s video for "[[Don't Wait]]", [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]' video for "[[Me, Myself and I (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Me, Myself and I]]", [[Modest Mouse]]'s "[[Little Motel]]", [[Alicia Keys]]'s "[[Like You'll Never See Me Again]]", and [[Mute Math]]'s "[[Typical (song)|Typical]]". It took Chris Martin a month to learn to sing the song backwards.<ref name="scientist video">{{cite web|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472164/20030529/coldplay.jhtml?headlines=true|title=The Story Behind Coldplay's 'The Scientist'|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=2006-08-01}}</ref>

The video was filmed at various locations, including [[London]] and the Bourne Woods, [[Surrey]] before the first leg of the ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' tour.<ref name="scientist video"/> It was directed by [[Jamie Thraves]].<ref name="scientist video"/> The video premiered on 14 August 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=6215|title=Coldplay - The Scientist|accessdate=2008-09-03|publisher=Mvdbase.com}}</ref> The video itself depicts Martin walking in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually the woods, picking up various pieces of a suit as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, he 'gets in' and passes out as his girlfriend, laying on the ground in front of the car, is shown reversely flying out of the car. The car backs out of the woods and through a broken barrier, which mends itself upon the car's passing. As the video closes, they are shown driving back up the road.<ref name="scientist video"/> [[Irish people|Irish]] actress [[Elaine Cassidy]] is also featured in the video.<ref name="scientist video"/>

In 2003, "The Scientist" won multiple [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]], and [[MTV Video Music Award - Breakthrough Video|Breakthrough Video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3094049.stm|title=Old and new battle for MTV awards|accessdate=2008-08-31|date=2003-07-27|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> It was also nominated at the 2004 [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Short Form Music Video]]; but lost to [[Johnny Cash]]'s video for "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]", respectively.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sal Cinquemani and Eric Henderson|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/features/grammyforecast2004.asp|title=Forecast: 46th Annual Grammy Awards|accessdate=2008-08-31|work=[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]}}</ref>
