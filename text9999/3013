Bartiromo is also a columnist and writer for several business and general interest magazines and the author of the book ''Use the News: How to Separate the Noise from the Investment Nuggets and Make Money in Any Economy''. She has won awards including the Union League of Philadelphia<U+2019>s ''Lincoln Statue Award'' (2004) and the Coalition of Italian-American Associations' ''Excellence in Broadcast Journalism Award'' (1997) and was nominated in 2002 for a [[Gerald Loeb Award]] for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism for a series covering the widows of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]].
 
==Personal life==
Bartiromo grew up in the [[Bay Ridge]] section of southern Brooklyn. As a teenager, she checked coats at her parents' [[Italian cuisine|Italian restaurant]], at which her father was the [[chef]].

Bartiromo graduated from [[New York University]] with a BA degree in [[journalism]] and a minor in [[economics]].

On [[13 June]] [[1999]], Bartiromo married Jonathan Steinberg, son of investor [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]]. Jonathan ("Jono") is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of WisdomTree Investments, a financial investment services company in Manhattan, most noted for their issuance of ETFs, or exchange-traded funds.<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title= WisdomTree; Jonathan Steinberg, Maria Bartiromo |url=http://www.forbes.com/etf/2006/06/12/wisdom-tree-etfs-cx_lm_0613etf.html}}</ref>

==Career==
[[Image:Maria Bartiromo on Times Square.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Maria Bartiromo advertisement in [[Times Square]].]]
Before joining CNBC in 1993, Bartiromo was a producer and assignment editor with [[CNN]] Business News.

Although Bartiromo was not the first person (she took over from analyst Roy Blumberg) to report regularly live from the floor of the  [[New York Stock Exchange]], she quickly became the most popular. With CNBC she hosted their ''[[Market Watch]]'' program from 10:00 to 12:00 [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]], as well as being a regular contributor to ''[[Squawk Box]]'' for many years before leaving the morning program. Bartiromo was nicknamed the ''Money Honey'' during the boom years of the stock market in the late 1990s due to her striking looks. She was also nicknamed the "Econo Babe".<ref>{{Citation |last=Zaslow |first=Jeffrey |title=Maria Bartiromo |url=http://www.usaweekend.com/98_issues/980125/980125talk_m_bartiromo.html |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>  

Since the 90s, the nickname "Money Honey" has spread to refer to attractive female financial news reporters in general. On [[January 16]], [[2007]], Bartiromo filed to trademark the term for herself. The multiple trademark applications were for many children's products including piggy banks, cookie jars, mouse pads, jigsaw puzzles, coloring books, comic books, notepads, children's paper place mats, coupon books, backpacks and items like toy banks and toy cash registers.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Del |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |title=CNBC journalist lands in the news spotlight |accessdate=2007-10-20 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/2007-01-30-bartiromo-usat_x.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=McLaughlin |first=Tim |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |title=CNBC "Money Honey" looks to sweeten her pocketbook |accessdate=2007-10-20 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSN2939490420070129}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office Search System |url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=toc&state=khn9dh.1.1&p_search=searchss&p_L=50&BackReference=&p_plural=yes&p_s_PARA1=&p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA1%24LD&expr=PARA1+AND+PARA2&p_s_PARA2=Bartiromo&p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA2%24ALL&p_op_ALL=AND&a_default=search&a_search=Submit+Query&a_search=Submit+Query}}</ref>

She has also made appearances on numerous non-financial television shows, including [[NBC Universal|NBC Universal's]] ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[The Caroline Rhea Show]]'', ''[[McEnroe]]'', and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', as well as guest-hosting on ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]''.

Her first book was ''Use the News: How to Separate the Noise from the Investment Nuggets and Make Money in Any Economy''.
  
Bartiromo currently (as of 2008) co-anchors with [[Dylan Ratigan]] the ''[[Closing Bell]]'' show on CNBC from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM ET. Her current contract with CNBC expires March 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hempel |first=Jessi |title=CNBC feels your pain... |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=[[31 March]] [[2008]] |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/31/news/companies/cnbc_pain.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2008033112 |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

==Controversies==
[[Image:Maria Bartiromo @ World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008.jpg|thumb|Maria Bartiromo at World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008]]

* [[Nicholas Maier]], a former employee of [[Jim Cramer]], alleged in his book, ''Trading with the Enemy'' (Collins, 2002), that Cramer would feed rumors to Bartiromo intended to affect the value of his positions when Bartiromo repeated them on the air. Time characterizes this as Cramer "gaming" Bartiromo. Cramer denied the accusation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kadlec |first=Dan |title=A Bartiromo Bounce? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002519,00.html |date=[[27 May]] [[2002]] |accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref>

* In 2003, Bartiromo interviewed [[Citigroup]]'s CEO, [[Sanford I. Weill]], she prefaced the interview with a "''full disclosure''" statement that she owned 1,000 shares of Citigroup stock. A number of journalism boards consider it unethical for reporters to own shares in the companies on which they report, and CNBC subsequently updated its disclosure policy.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Brooks |coauthors=Langley, Monica |title=CNBC Defends Anchor Bartiromo |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116978688800288808-JlonRx7050wMBiaD9jj9aMU3X_U_20070202.html |date=[[26 January]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> 

* Media interest also surrounded Bartiromo when she broke live on CNBC that [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] had told her at the annual [[White House Correspondents' Association#WHCA Dinner (WHCD)|White House Correspondents' Association dinner]] in May 2006 that his position on interest rates was "misunderstood". This appeared to indicate that Bernanke's interest rate stance was less [[Federal Open Market Committee#Stance on inflation|dovish]] than had been interpreted by some market analysts. Other members of the press, along with Bernanke himself, felt that the comments had been made [[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|off the record]], and that by using her seemingly random seating position at the dinner, Bartiromo got access to market-making news which other reporters had no way of attaining (interest rates, and speculation on them, being a crucial price-setting tool for many financial instruments). A CNBC spokesman responded that Bernanke had never told Bartiromo that his remarks were off the record.<ref>{{cite news |last=Robb |first=Greg  |title=Bernanke slips on Bartiromo peel |work=[[MarketWatch]] |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?dist=newsfinder&siteid=mktw&guid=%7B9293A0E5%2D7C1E%2D4DE6%2DA3D5%2D016014A3C736%7D |date=[[2 May]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> 

* In 2007, controversy arose over the nature of Bartiromo's relationship with Todd Thomson, former chief of Citigroup's wealth management unit. Thomson at one point flew with a group of employees to [[China]], then left the employees to make their own arrangements for the trip back while he took the corporate jet back to the U.S. with Bartiromo.<ref name="times">{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Siobhan |title=Ex-Citigroup boss tells of <U+2018>smear campaign<U+2019> |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article2827779.ece |date=[[8 November]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> In another instance, Thomson spent $5 million for the sponsorship of programming on the [[Sundance Channel]] that Bartiromo was tapped to host.<ref name="CBS">{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Frazier |title=Bartiromo Did Nothing Wrong, Says CNBC |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[CBS News]] |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/26/ap/entertainment/mainD8MT7HL80.shtml |date=[[26 January]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> Thomson was eventually ousted by Citigroup for reasons including his contact with Bartiromo.<ref name="times" /> CNBC has stood by Bartiromo, claiming that her relationship with Thomson was a case of "legitimate business assignments".<ref name="CBS" />
