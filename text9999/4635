'''King's Highway&nbsp;23''', commonly referred to as '''Highway&nbsp;23''', is a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. The route travels from [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway&nbsp;7]] east of [[Elginfield, Ontario|Elginfield]] north to [[Ontario Highway 9|Highway&nbsp;9]] and [[Ontario Highway 89|Highway&nbsp;89]] in [[Harriston, Ontario|Harriston]]. The total length of Highway&nbsp;23 is {{convert|97.7|km|abbr=off}}. The highway was first established in 1927 between [[Ontario Highway 8|Highway&nbsp;8]] in [[Mitchell, Ontario|Mitchell]] and Highway&nbsp;9 in [[Teviotdale, Ontario|Teviotdale]], via [[Monkton, Ontario|Monkton]], [[Listowel, Ontario|Listowel]] and [[Palmerston, Ontario|Palmerston]]. As part of a depression relief program, it was extended south to Highway&nbsp;7 in 1934. It remained relatively unchanged until 2003, when it was rerouted northward from Palmerston to Harriston.

== Route description ==
Highway&nbsp;23 begins at Highway&nbsp;7, east of Elginfield, a community straddling the boundary between the municipalities of [[Middlesex Centre]] and [[Lucan Biddulph]]. The route travels north through the latter, surrounded on both sides by farmland. At Whalen Corners, the highway curves northeast as it exits [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]], becoming the boundary road between [[Huron County, Ontario|Huron County]] to the west and [[Perth County, Ontario|Perth County]] to the east. The highway passes through the communities of [[Woodham, Ontario|Woodham]] and [[Kirkton, Ontario|Kirkton]], crossing completely into Perth County just north of the latter. It later enters [[Russeldale, Ontario|Russeldale]], meeting the eastern terminus of former [[Ontario Highway 83|Highway&nbsp;83]]<ref name="former">{{cite book

(County Road&nbsp;83) as it swerves north. Approximately {{convert|9|km}} beyond there it enters the town of [[Mitchell, Ontario|Mitchell]], where it is known as Blanchard Street. The route intersects Highway&nbsp;8 (Huron Street), and becomes [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with it briefly to cross the [[Thames River (Ontario)|North Thames River]] before branching back northeast along St. George Street. Midway between Mitchell and the village of Monkton, the highway bisects the community of [[Bornholm, Ontario|Bornholm]] within the municipality of [[West Perth, Ontario|West Perth]]. Prior to entering Monkton, Highway&nbsp;23 curves gently towards the southeast; In the middle of the village, drivers must turn at an intersection with Perth County Road&nbsp;55 to remain on Highway&nbsp;23.<ref name="2010 mapart">{{cite map

Continuing its northeasterly course, the highway passes through more farmland, now within the town of [[North Perth, Ontario|North Perth]], and serves the communities of [[Newry, Ontario|Newry]] and [[Atwood, Ontario|Atwood]] before encountering former [[Ontario Highway 86|Highway&nbsp;86]]<ref name="former" /> (County Road&nbsp;86) on the western edge of [[Listowel, Ontario|Listowel]]. South of this intersection, the route is known locally as Mitchell Road South. It turns southeast onto Main Street West, where it once travelled concurrently with Highway&nbsp;86 before turning northeast onto Wallace Avenue North. The final leg of the route passes through the village of [[Gowanstown, Ontario|Gowanstown]]. The route gently curves to the east before turning north at an intersection just west of Palmerston, where it crosses the boundary into [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]] and the Town of [[Minto, Ontario|Minto]]. Eight&nbsp;kilometres (5&nbsp;miles) north of the intersection, Highway&nbsp;23 encounters the western terminus of former [[Ontario Highway 87|Highway&nbsp;87]]<ref name="former" /> (County Road&nbsp;87), where it turns east then northeast. The route enters Harriston, where it is locally known as Arthur Street. The Highway&nbsp;23 designation ends at a junction with Highway&nbsp;9 and Wellington County Road&nbsp;109 (formerly a segment of Highway&nbsp;9),<ref name="former" /> locally known as Elora Street. The road continues beyond the junction as Highway&nbsp;89.<ref name="2010 mapart" /><ref name="gmaps" />

== History ==
Highway&nbsp;23 was first established on June&nbsp;22, 1927, when the [[Department of Highways]] assumed the road from Mitchell to Teviotdale through Perth and Wellington counties, via Monkton, Listowel and Palmerston, connecting [[Ontario Highway 8|Highway&nbsp;8]] and [[Ontario Highway 9|Highway&nbsp;9]].<ref name="assumed">{{cite report

As part of [[Great Depression|depression]] relief work undertaken by the department during the early 1930s, Highway 23 was extended from Highway&nbsp;8 to Highway&nbsp;7 east of Elginfield on July&nbsp;11, 1934.<ref>{{cite report

Highway&nbsp;23 remained unaltered between 1934 and 1998. On January&nbsp;1, 1998, the section from the [[Ontario Highway 89|Highway&nbsp;89]] junction west of Palmerston to Highway 9 in Teviotdale was decommissioned, resulting in the northern terminus of Highway&nbsp;23 becoming the western terminus of Highway&nbsp;89.<ref name="WDW">{{cite report
