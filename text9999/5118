{{pp-protected|expiry=2012-12-06T20:13:23Z|small=yes}}The '''North Wales child abuse scandal''' was the subject of a three-year, <U+00A3>13 million investigation into the physical and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse of children]] in [[Residential care#Child care|care homes]] in [[Clwyd]] and [[Gwynedd]], [[North Wales]], including the Bryn Estyn children's home at [[Wrexham]], between 1974 and 1990.<ref name="The Guardian Q&A">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,232865,00.html The Guardian, ''Questions and answers that surround a catalogue of abuse against children'', 16 February 2000].  Accessed 5 November 2012</ref>  The report into the scandal, headed by retired [[High Court judge]] Sir [[Ronald Waterhouse]] [[QC]], which was published in 2000, resulted in changes in policy in [[England and Wales]] into how authorities deal with children in [[Social care in England|care]], and to the settling of 140 compensation claims on behalf of victims of [[child abuse|abuse]].   

In November 2012, new allegations led to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]], announcing that a senior independent figure, later named as Mrs Justice [[Julia Macur]], would examine the conduct and remit of the Waterhouse Inquiry.  In addition, the [[Home Secretary]], [[Theresa May]], announced a new police inquiry into how the original allegations were dealt with, as well as investigating any new allegations.

==Initial allegations and investigations==
In 1989, a [[residential care]] worker in Gwynedd, Alison Taylor, made a series of allegations against senior social care professionals working for the authority.  After being dismissed from her own post with the authority, she made further allegations about a care home, Bryn Estyn at Wrexham, which had been run until its closure in 1984 by Clwyd County Council.  With the support of local politicians and the newly appointed Director of [[Social Services]] in Clwyd, several instances of previous allegations were uncovered, which had either not been properly investigated or where reports calling for action had been ignored.<ref name=independent>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-suffering-and-the-shame-1303596.html  Roger Dobson, ''The suffering and the shame'', The Independent, 7 April 1996].

The matter was referred to [[North Wales Police]] who undertook an inquiry in 1993.  As a result six residential social workers were prosecuted for abuse, three of whom had worked at Bryn Estyn.  There were then allegations that members of the police force had themselves colluded in [[cover-up|covering up]] allegations, and a further inquiry, undertaken by John Jillings, was commissioned by Clwyd County Council.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20234776, BBC News, ''Wales child abuse: 'No public names' in report'', 7 November 2012].  Accessed 7 November 2012</ref>  The report of that inquiry, however, was not published because of concerns over [[English defamation law|libel]], and legal advice and concerns from the council's insurers, [[Municipal Mutual Insurance]], which warned that the report would encourage court cases and compensation claims.<ref name=independent/><ref name=corby/>  The former deputy head of Bryn Estyn, Peter Howarth, was jailed for 10 years in 1994 for sexually abusing teenage boys;<ref name="BBC"/> he died in 1997.<ref name=guardian160200>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/feb/16/audreygillan Audrey Gillan, ''Refuges that turned into purgatory'', The Guardian, 16 February 2000].

==The Waterhouse Inquiry==
In 1996, the then [[Secretary of State for Wales]], [[William Hague]], ordered a [[Tribunal of Inquiry]] into allegations of hundreds of cases of child abuse in care homes in former county council areas of Clwyd and Gwynedd between 1974 and 1990. Sir Ronald Waterhouse QC, a retired High Court judge, was appointed to head the inquiry.<ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/21/newsid_2506000/2506835.stm "Carers accused in child abuse inquiry" BBC On This Day]</ref> 

The inquiry began in January 1997. The tribunal sat for 203 days, and heard evidence from more than 650 people.<ref name=bbc021210>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20182106 BBC News, ''Call for new investigation into north Wales abuse scandal'', 2 November 2012].  Accessed 5 November 2012</ref> More than 80 people, many of whom were care staff or teachers, were named as child abusers in statements to the inquiry.  It was stated to be "the biggest investigation ever held in Britain into allegations of physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children who passed through the care system".<ref name="BBC"/>  It ended in 1998 and its findings were published in February 2000, as ''Lost In Care''.<ref name=smith>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1pfkixtoexAC&pg=PA43&dq=%22bryn+estyn%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d7aXUJTYNYLP0QW3rYHoDA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22bryn%20estyn%22&f=false  Mark Smith, ''Rethinking Residential Child Care: Positive Perspectives'', 2009, pp.41-44]</ref>  The report concluded that widespread sexual abuse of boys, as well as physical abuse and the unacceptable use of force, had occurred in children's homes in Clwyd,<ref name=guardian160200/> and named and criticised almost 200 people, for either abusing children or failing to offer them sufficient protection.  It said:<ref name=guardian160200/><blockquote>"The evidence before us has disclosed that for many children who were consigned to Bryn Estyn, in the 10 or so years of its existence as a community home, it was a form of purgatory or worse from which they emerged more damaged than when they had entered and for whom the future had become even more bleak."</blockquote>  Although it identified 28 alleged perpetrators, none were named in the report.<ref name=bbc051112/> It found no evidence "to establish that there was a wide-ranging conspiracy involving prominent persons and others with the objective of sexual activity with children in care",<ref name=guardian160200/> but did recognise the existence of a [[paedophile]] ring in the Wrexham and [[Chester]] area.<ref name=guardian160200/><ref name=smith/><ref name=bbc021210/>
 
The Inquiry made 72 recommendations for changes, constituting a massive overhaul of the way in which children in care are dealt with by local councils, social services and the police.<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="The Guardian Q&A"/> After the report was published, 140 compensation claims were settled on behalf of victims, and a [[Children's Commissioner for Wales]] was appointed as a result of one of its recommendations.<ref name="BBC"/>

==''The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt''==
In 2005, the cultural historian [[Richard Webster (author)|Richard Webster]] published a book, ''The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt'', which investigated the scandal. It was highly critical of the Waterhouse Inquiry, argued that abuse scandals could be [[Moral panic|phenomena created by public hysteria]],<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jul/31/richard-webster-obituary | title = Richard Webster obituary | last = Woffinden | first = Bob | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2011-07-31| accessdate = 2011-08-02 | location=London}}</ref> and reported a number of cases of apparently innocent care workers imprisoned as a consequence of [[false accusations|false and unsubstantiated accusations]] elicited by police trawling operations.  Webster also questioned whether some of those claiming abuse had been motivated by the prospect of financial reward.<ref name=smith/>  [[Wrexham County Borough Council|Wrexham Council]] refused permission for a conference, arranged by [[Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers]], a support group, to be held at Bryn Estyn - now renamed the Erlas Centre - in 2005; Webster was to have been the main speaker.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4552643.stm  BBC News, ''Abuse group banned from meeting'', 16 May 2005].

==Further allegations and investigations in 2012==
On 2 November 2012, following the revelations in the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal]], the [[BBC]] current affairs programme ''[[Newsnight]]'' aired an item about the scandal in which one of those who had suffered abuse in the 1980s, Steve Messham, made renewed claims that there had been a much wider circle of abusers, including businessmen, members of the police and senior politicians, extending beyond the immediate area to London and beyond.<ref name="Daily Telegraph 03 November 2012">{{cite news|last=Sawyer|first=Patrick|title=Call for new investigation into north Wales abuse scandal|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9652824/BBCs-Newsnight-airs-claims-of-child-abuse-against-leading-Tory-politician.html|accessdate=06 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=3 November 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BxoUn5qU|archivedate=6 November 2012}}</ref>   He called for a further investigation to be carried out.<ref name=bbc021210/>  The Children's Commissioner for Wales, Keith Towler, supported the call for an inquiry, stating that the remit of the Waterhouse Inquiry had been too narrow.<ref>{{cite news |first= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20196086 |publisher=BBC News |title=Children's Commissioner for Wales calls for abuse probe |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=5 November 2012 }}</ref>  

On 5 November 2012 the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]], said that any new allegations of abuse would be investigated, and announced that a "senior independent figure", later named as Mrs Justice [[Julia Macur]],<ref name=bbc061112/> would be appointed to look urgently into the terms of the original inquiry and whether it was properly constituted.<ref name=bbc051112>{{cite news |first= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20204687 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Wales child abuse: PM orders sex abuse inquiry probe |date=5 November 2012 |accessdate=5 November 2012 }}</ref>  [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]] MP called for a wider ranging inquiry, and referred to allegations of abuse by a former [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] minister.<ref>{{cite news |first= |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/nov/05/tory-child-sex-ring-claim |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Tory child sex abuse ring claim: Cameron races to control scandal |date=5 November 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2012 }}</ref>
The [[Home Secretary]], [[Theresa May]], said that "... we should look to make sure that the work that was done in relation to the Waterhouse inquiry did cover everything that it needed to cover."  She announced on 6 November that [[Keith Bristow]], the head of the [[National Crime Agency]], would lead an investigation into how old claims of abuse were handled, and at fresh allegations.  The investigation would involve the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] (SOCA) and the [[Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]] (CEOP), and would report by April 2013.<ref name=bbc061112>{{cite news |first= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20221959 |publisher=BBC News |title=Crime Agency head to examine north Wales abuse claims' |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2012 }}</ref>  The [[Shadow Home Secretary]], [[Yvette Cooper]], called for a single, overarching public inquiry to be held in order to examine all the recent allegations of child abuse, including those relating to the Jimmy Savile scandal,<ref>{{cite news |first= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9766000/9766976.stm |publisher=BBC Democracy Live |title=May announces details of child abuse investigations |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012 }}</ref> a call which was supported by former minister [[Tim Loughton]] and by the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Helene |last=Mulholland |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/nov/08/david-cameron-warns-witch-hunt-paedophilia |title=David Cameron warns against 'witch-hunt' amid paedophilia allegations |work=The Guardian |date=8 November 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012 }}</ref>

On 6 November, ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' reported that [[Sir Peter Morrison]], a former aide to [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[City of Chester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chester]], who died in 1995, had been 'seen' driving a boy away from the Bryn Estyn home.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Peter Morrison 'seen' at abuse care home|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/2012-11-07/sir-peter-morrison-seen-at-abuse-care-home/|accessdate=9 November 2012|publisher=[[ITV News]]|date=7 November 2012}}</ref> The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] said that they were investigating the claims.<ref name=bbc061112/>  The following day, [[Ann Clwyd]] MP called for the 1994 Jillings report to be published.<ref>{{cite news |first= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20251861 |publisher=BBC News |title=Wales child abuse: Publish Jillings report - Ann Clwyd MP |date=8 November 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012 }}</ref>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that references made to a past Cabinet member's involvement may be the result of confusion over the identities of two members of a family sharing the same surname.<ref>{{cite news |author=Leigh, David, Morris,  Steven and van der Zee, Bibi |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/nov/08/mistaken-identity-tory-abuse-claim |title="Mistaken identity" led to top Tory abuse claim |work=The Guardian |date=8 November 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2012 }}</ref>
