'''Operation Wotan''' was a codename for the German [[tank]] operation with the goal of capturing [[Moscow]] during the [[World War II]], developed mainly by [[Hitler]].<ref name="Macksey">[[Kenneth Macksey]] [http://militera.lib.ru/research/macksey/04.html ''The Hitler Options''. London: Greenhill/Stackpole, 1995]</ref> The name refers to [[Wotan]], a [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] god.

The operation was scheduled to be launched by [[Army Group South]] on [[September 9]], [[1941]] and to last no more than eight weeks.<ref name="Macksey"/> The date was established on August, 29  in declaration addressed to the [[OKH]].  The start was slowed down by initial [[Soviet]] attacks of [[Semyon Budyonny]] and [[Semyon Timoshenko]].  However Guderian's tank units soon smashed the Soviet troops between [[Oryol]] and [[Kursk]], forming a gap which was used by Kleist's [[German 1st Panzer Group|1st Panzer Group]].  It was decided to make the main strike towards the [[Dankov]]-[[Kasimov]]-[[Gorkiy]] direction, but it was changed by [[Kesselring]].  However the German troops experienced severe difficulties concerning the casualties and the subsequent frosts.  An opportunity for Soviet counter-offensive occurred shortly after.
