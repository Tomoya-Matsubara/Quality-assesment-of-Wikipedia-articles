'''Marshall Field and Company Building''' or '''Macy's at State Street''' is the former flagship location of the former [[Marshall Field's]] [[department store]] and the current location of the [[Chicago]] flagship of [[Macy's]].  The building is located in the [[Chicago Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] in {{city-state|Cook County|Illinois}}, [[United States]], and it takes up the entire [[city block]] bounded by [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] to the west, [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] to the north, Wabash Avenue to the east, and Washington Street to the south.<ref name=NHLitCMA/>  The former department store established numerous important business firsts in this building.<ref name=PDX/>  Both the building name and and the name of the stores formerly headquartered at this building changed names on [[September 9]][[2006]] as a result of the merger of the [[May Department Stores]] (Marshall Field's former parent) with the [[Federated Department Stores]] which led to the integration of the Marshall Field's stores into the Macy's retailing network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Sept_20/ai_n15399012|title=Federated Announces Strategic Decisions to Integrate May Company Acquisition; Company to Focus on Building the Macy's and Bloomingdale's Brands While Increasing Profitability|accessdate=2008-04-05|date=[[2005-09-20]]|publisher=CNET Networks, Inc.|work=Business Wire}}</ref>

==Business History==
{{mainarticle|Marshall Field's}}
{{double image|left|Marshall field.jpg|149|Potter Palmer.jpg|159|[[Marshall Field]] (left) and [[Potter Palmer]] (right) were instrumental in the [[Marshall Field's]] move to anchor the [[Loop Retail Historic District]] at [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] and Washington Street.}}

Although the official corporate name of the retail entity based in this building had been [[Marshall Field & Company]] (nicknamed Marshall Field's) from 1881 until 2006, the store has had five different names since its inception in 1852 as P. Palmer & Co.<ref name=TAMF/> In 1868, after bowing out of involvement in day to day operations with his new partners of Field, Palmer & Leiter, [[Potter Palmer]] convinced [[Marshall Field]] and [[Levi Leiter]] to move the Field, Leiter & Co. store to a building Palmer owned on State Street at the corner of Washington Street.<ref name=MFaC>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.urban-history.org/ven/dss/fields.shtml|title=Marshall Field and Company|accessdate=2008-03-02|publisher=Scott A. Newman|work=Jazz Age Chicago|date=[[2006-05-11]]}}</ref>  After being consumed by the [[Great Chicago Fire]] and splitting the wholesale business from the retail operations, the store resumed operations at State and Washington in a building leased from the [[Singer Sewing Machine Company]]. This building was consumed in another fire in 1877, and when a new Singer Building was built to replace it at the same location in 1879, Field purchased it.  The business has remained there ever since, and it has added four subsequent buildings to form the integrated structure that is now called the Marshall Field and Company Building.<ref name=MFaC/><ref name=TAMF/>

Chicago's retailing center was State Street in the downtown [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, and this center has been anchored by [[Marshall Field's]] and its predecessor companies in this building.<ref name=EoCSDaM>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1141.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|date=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2008-03-02|author=Bennett, Larry|title=Shopping Districts and Malls}}</ref>  However, commuter suburbs began to have significant retail districts by the 1920s.<ref name=EoCSDaM/>  After 1950, suburban development and the [[Magnificent Mile]] reduced the role of the Loop's daily significance to many Chicagoans as downtown retail sales slipped.<ref name=EoCtL>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/764.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|date=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2008-03-02|author=Danzer, Gerald A.|title=The Loop}}</ref>  Nonetheless, the Marshall Field and Company Building has survived at this location.

On [[September 9]][[2006]], at the time of the store conversion, the name of the building was officially changed to "Macy's at State Street."<ref name=MUEPfSSFS/> Around the time of the conversion of Marshall Field's to Macy's the building was the location of [[picket]]ting and protesting by opponents of the conversion.<ref name=PMMFE>{{cite web|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/Marshall.Field.s.2.331981.html|title=Protesters Mourn Marshall Field's End|accessdate=2008-03-01|date=[[2006-09-09]]|publisher=CBS Broadcasting, Inc.|work=cbs2chicago.com}}</ref> The Marshall Field & Company corporate entity that survived 125 years was founded by [[Marshall Field]] after buying out his various partners, and the current building was built to his instructions.  The sentimental objections to the conversion that both eliminated the existence of the corporate entity bearing his name and renamed the building bearing his name were widely reported in the [[News media (United States)|national media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icjl.org/wsj060617.pdf|title=Give the Lady What She Wants|accessdate=2008-03-01|date=[[2006-06-17]]|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|author=Heriot, Gail}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/us/17chicago.html?scp=2&sq=Marshall+Field&st=nyt|title=Loss of a Beloved Department Store Breeds a New Kind of Superfan|accessdate=2008-03-01|date=[[2007-01-17]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Sander, Libby}}</ref>

===Business legend===
The store housed a business that established new retailing standards and broke with many business conventions of the day. Before Marshall Field's death in 1906, his company became the largest wholesale and retail dry goods enterprise in the world.<ref name=PDX/>  The Marshall Field<U+2019>s & Company offered the first [[bridal registry]], provided the first in-store dining facilities and established the first [[European]] buying office. In the early 1900<U+2019>s, annual sales topped $60 million and buying branches were located in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Berlin]].<ref name=PDX/>

The building has hosted the first [[escalator]]s in a department store and continues to be the second largest store in the world.<ref name=RfaD>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcitychicago.com/chicago/4918.html|title=Requiem for a Dream |accessdate=2008-03-02|publisher=Newcity Communications, Inc.|author=Hieggelke, Brian|date=[[2005-12-06]]}}</ref>  Marshall Field took over the operations of the store in 1881 and became the first merchant to post the price of the goods in plain sight, which eliminated the common practice of haggling and charging whatever the buyer would pay.<ref name=PDX/>  On top of that, Field stood behind his product with his famous slogan that symbolized his willingness to refund the full price of all merchandise purchased in his store: {{cquote|Give the lady what she wants.<ref name=PDX/>}}

==Building details==
[[Image:Field's Tiffany Ceiling.jpg|left|Marshall Field Clock.jpg|thumb|[[Tiffany & Company]] glass [[mosaic]] ceiling.]]
The 12-story [[granite]] building was built in stages between 1892 and 1914.<ref name=PMMFE/><ref name=TAMF/>  The building was built on a six partition block with sections that were added to the building in 1902, 1906, 1907, and 1914.<ref name=MaSS/><ref name=TAMF/>  The two primary sections along State Street (The north building built in 1902 and the south in 1907) were designed by [[Charles B. Atwood]] (before his death) at [[D. H. Burnham & Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10591.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|date=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2008-03-02|title=Marshall Field & Company Store, c.1904-1913}}</ref> 

The current building has several atria: A Tiffany & Co. mosaic dome caps a 5-story atrium in the southwest corner; the northwest section has a 13-story skylit atrium, and a newer atrium with a fountain in the center is bridged by double escalator banks.<ref name=MaSS/> The Tiffany Dome is the first iridescent glass dome and it continues to be the largest glass mosaic of its kind.<ref name=PDX/> Only [[Egypt]]'s 3,000-year-old [[Temple of Karnak]], with its {{convert|70|ft|m|lk=on|adj=on}} columns rivals the four {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Ionic column|Ionic]] granite columns on the State Street [[fa<U+00E7>ade]].<ref name=TAMF/>

The building is known for its clocks, which weigh about {{convert|7.5|ST|LT|lk=on}} each,<ref name=TAMF/> on its northwest and southwest corners along State Street at both Randolph and Washington.<ref name=MaSS/>  The southwest clock, known as the Great Clock, was installed on [[November 26]][[1897]].  Marshall Field envisioned the clock as a beacon for his store which he viewed as a meeting place.  The clock was installed after the southwest corner of the store had became a popular meeting place and people began leaving notes for one another on the Marshall Field's windows.  The clock was an attempt to end this practice, and encourage punctuality.<ref name=TAMF>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/September-2006/The-Annotated-Marshall-Fields/|title=The Annotated: Marshall Field's|accessdate=2008-04-03|year=2006|month=September|publisher=[[Chicago Magazine]]|author=Johnson, Geoffrey}}</ref>  

Today, the building is located at 111 North State Street within the [[Loop Retail Historic District]] of the Chicago Loop across State Street from [[Block 37]], across Randolph Street from the [[Joffrey Tower]], and across Wabash Avenue from [[The Heritage at Millennium Park]].<ref name=NHLitCMA>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2471.html|title=National Historic Landmarks in the Chicago Metropolitan Area|accessdate=2008-03-01|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005}}</ref>  An underground public concourse connects the basement to 25 East Washington, which used to house the Marshall Field's Men's Store.<ref name=MaSS/>  The building is a major hub of the [[Loop Pedway System]].

On [[November 3]][[1945]], [[Norman Rockwell]] drew a picture of one of the Marshall Field Building clocks on the cover of the [[Saturday Evening Post]].<ref name=PDX>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdxhistory.com/html/marshall_fields.html|title=Marshall Field's|accessdate=2008-04-03|publisher=PdxHistory.com|date=[[2008-02-09]]}}</ref>  The Rockwell painting shows a man perched atop a ladder and adjusting one of the Marshall Field's clock to correspond with his own pocket watch.  The [[Oriental Theatre (Chicago)|Oriental Theatre]] in the background proves this depicts the matching Great Clock at the northwest corner of State & Randolph. In 1948, Rockwell donated the original painting, ''The Clock Mender'', to the store, where it had hung on the seventh floor ever since.
