==Pharmacology==
Quazepam is selective for type I benzodiazepine receptors containing the alpha1 subunit, similar to other drugs such as [[zaleplon]] and [[zolpidem]]. As a result quazepam has little or no [[muscle relaxant]] properties. Most other benzodiazepines are unselective and bind to type1 GABAA receptors and type2 GABAA receptors. Type1 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors include the alpha1 subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which are responsible for [[hypnotic]] properties of the drug. Type2 receptors include the alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 subunits which are responsible for [[anxiolytic]], [[amnesia]] and muscle relaxant properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tanaka M, Suemaru K, Watanabe S, Cui R, Li B, Araki H |title=Comparison of short- and long-acting benzodiazepine-receptor agonists with different receptor selectivity on motor coordination and muscle relaxation following thiopental-induced anesthesia in mice |journal=J.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Quazepam has an absorption half life of 0.4 hours with a peak in plasma levels after 1.75 hours. It is eliminated both renally and through feces.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zampaglione N, Hilbert JM, Ning J, Chung M, Gural R, Symchowicz S |title=Disposition and metabolic fate of 14C-quazepam in man |journal=Drug Metab.

==Mechanism of action==
Quazepam modulates specific GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors via the [[benzodiazepine site]] on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. This modulation enhances the actions of GABA, causing an increase in opening frequency of the chloride ion channel which results in an increased influx of chloride ions into the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Quazepam, unique amongst benzodiazepine drugs selectively targets type1 benzodiazepine receptors which results reduced [[sleep latency]] in promotion of sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meldrum BS, Chapman AG |title=Benzodiazepine receptors and their relationship to the treatment of epilepsy |journal=Epilepsia |volume=27 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S3<U+2013>13 |year=1986 |pmid=3017690 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Corda MG, Giorgi O, Longoni BM, ''et al'' |title=Characterization of 3H-2-oxo-quazepam binding in the human brain |journal=Prog.

No firm conclusions can be drawn however, whether long term use of quazepam does not produce tolerance as few if any long term clinical trials extending beyond 4 weeks of chronic use.<ref name="pmid2894293" /> Quazepam should be withdrawn gradually if used beyond 4 weeks of use to avoid the risk of a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] developing.  Very high dosage administration over prolonged periods of time, up to 52 weeks, of quazepam in animal studies provoked severe withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation, including excitability, [[hyperactivity]], [[convulsions]] and the death of two of the monkeys due to withdrawal related convulsions. More monkeys died however, in the diazepam treated monkeys.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Black HE, Szot RJ, Arthaud LE, ''et al'' |title=Preclinical safety evaluation of the benzodiazepine quazepam |journal=Arzneimittelforschung |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=906<U+2013>13 |year=1987 |month=August |pmid=2890357 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Elderly==
Quazepam is more tolerability for elderly patients compared to [[flurazepam]] due to its reduced next day impairments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dement WC |title=Objective measurements of daytime sleepiness and performance comparing quazepam with flurazepam in two adult populations using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=52 Suppl |issue= |pages=31<U+2013>7 |year=1991 |month=September |pmid=1680123 |doi= |url=}}</ref> However, another study showed marked next day impairments after repeated administration due to accumulation of quazepam and its long acting metabolites. Thus the medical literature shows conflicts on quazepam's side effect profile.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Takahashi T, Okajima Y, Otsubo T, ''et al'' |title=Comparison of hangover effects among triazolam, flunitrazepam and quazepam in healthy subjects: a preliminary report |journal=Psychiatry Clin.

An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including quazepam, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother | year = 2006 | month = June | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168<U+2013>92 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

==Drug misuse==
Quazepam is a drug with the potential for misuse. Two types of drug misuse can occur either recreational misuse is where the drug is taken to achieve a high or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=31<U+2013>41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
