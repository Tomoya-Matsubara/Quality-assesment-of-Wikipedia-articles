'''''1982, Janine''''' is a [[novel]] by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] author [[Alasdair Gray]].   His second, it was published in [[1984]].  Its use of [[pornography]] as a [[narrative]] device attracted much criticism, although others, including Gray himself, consider it his best work.

{{spoiler}}

The novel is narrated by Jock McLeish, a supervisor of the installation of alarm systems.   [[Divorce]]d, [[alcoholic]] and approaching fifty, his problems coalesce in a long night of the soul in a hotel room in [[Greenock]].

McLeish attempts to spend the night assembling an intricate [[pornographic]] [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]].   His cast of characters includes: Janine, based on a childhood memory of [[Jane Russell]] in [[The Outlaw]]; Superb (short for Superbitch); and Big Momma, a [[obesity|obese]] [[lesbian]].   All of these are submitted to [[sadomasochistic]] practices, parts of which are described at some length.   However, McLeish constantly returns to reminiscences of his previous life and [[lover]]s.  These prompt his attempted [[suicide]].  Chapter 11 of the novel is a [[typographical]] explosion, with the text splitting into several parallel voices on each page (including that of [[God]]).   The crisis concludes with McLeish [[vomit]]ing up the pills which he had hoped would kill him, and facing the truth of his actions as morning dawns.

==Criticism==
On the [[dust jacket]] of the [[hardback]] edition, Gray wrote that "Every stylistic excess and moral defect which critics conspired to ignore in the author's first books... is to be found here in concentrated form."

The [[paperback]] edition of the novel concludes with an appendix of criticism of the work, both for and against.  Critics praising the work included Jonathan Baumbach in the [[New York Times]] ("1982 Janine has a verbal energy, an intensity of vision") and [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] in the [[Times Literary Supplement]] ("His style is limpid and classically elegant").   The Boyd quotation is juxtaposed with one from Paul Ableman in [[The Literary Review]] criticising the "irritating mannerisms".  Peter Levi on the [[BBC]] called the book "Radioactive hogwash", while Joe Ambrose of [[The Irish Sunday Tribune]] called the author "a vainglorious lout" and "a profoundly reactionary penman".

In an introduction to the [[2003]] Canongate Classic edition, [[Will Self]] argues that the controversial pornographic fantasies illustrate McLeish's repression of his past real love affairs, reflect his [[reactionary]] political stance, and show the effects of his childhood experiences.  McLeish's linking of sex with the idea of "homecoming" originates in his difficult relationship with his mother.

Self also notes the significance of the title, [[1982]] being "a point at which Scotland could be said to have reached just one of its many nadirs".  This lowpoint included the destruction of the [[coal]] industry which had employed McLeish's father, under a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of which McLeish is a supporter.
