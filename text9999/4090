The '''Prince George's County Sheriff's Office''' (PGSO) provides law enforcement services in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], [[Maryland]] in the United States. Its headquarters is located in [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]]. The Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer of Prince George's County and is elected by the citizens every four years. <ref>http://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Government/JudicialBranch/Sheriff/</ref> 

Created in 1696, the traditional duties of the Sheriff are keeper of the public peace and the enforcement arm of the county [[court]], analogous to the [[US Marshal Service]]. The PGSO has a relatively long history embedded within [[History of Maryland|Maryland]] and the [[History of the United States|United States]]. The PGSO was involved with events that occurred during the [[burning of Washington]] and affected the writing of the United States [[National Anthem]]. Prior to 1931, the PGSO was the sole law enforcement organization within the county. 

Today, general law enforcement of the county is provided by [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|multiple agencies]] but mostly left to the separate [[Prince George's County Police Department]], though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies, is a progressive agency with an array of services from a [[SWAT|Specialized Services Team]] dealing with high-risk [[warrants]] and barricade situations to Community Services aiding the county citizens in safety education.

==History==

The Sheriff's Office for [[Prince George's County]] was founded April 22, 1696. The governor of Maryland, Sir Francis Nicholson appointed Thomas Greenfield as the first [[Sheriff]]. The St. Paul's Church in [[Charlestown, Maryland|Charlestown]] held the headquarters for the Sheriff's Office until the 1720s when it was relocated to the town of [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]]. At the time, there was no set salary for the sheriff. Instead, he was paid in hog's head of tobacco. The headquarters for the sheriff's office was held in Upper Marlboro until 2000, when the sitting Sheriff, Al Black, moved it to [[Largo, Maryland|Largo]] where it resided until August 2008 when the current [[Michael A. Jackson (sheriff)|sheriff]] returned the office headquarters to [[Upper Marlboro]] where it is currently located.<ref>http://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov//Government/JudicialBranch/Sheriff/index.asp?nivel=foldmenu(6)/</ref>

===War of 1812===
[[Image:BurningofWashington1814.jpg|right|thumb|The [[British Army]] on their way back into Prince George's County after the burning of [[Washington, DC|Washington]]]]
During the [[War of 1812]], at the time of the Burning of Washington, the Sheriff's Office became involved in an occurrence that ultimately led to the writing of the United States [[national anthem]]. As the British army marched from Washington they passed through Prince George's County. Because the residents had cooperated with the British, the commander ensured that minimal damage was inflicted upon the local residents and their property. After the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], the British army returned to the area of Upper Marlboro. However, this time some of the British soldiers looted local farms. A Sheriff's Posse subsequently arrested the offending soldiers and placed them in the county jail. Upon learning about the arrest of his soldiers, the British commander ordered the arrest of the Sheriff and the posse in turn. One of the posse members was Dr. William Beam. Beam was ultimately arrested and held for ranson on a British warship. Beam's brother-in-law, [[Francis Scott Key]] went to Baltimore Harbor in search of him. He witnessed the British fleet under attack which was the inspiration of the [[Star Spangled Banner]].<ref>{{cite web

Arnaud was shot in the neck and Magruder was shot in the back of the head. Logan fled the scene and was apprehended two days later by undercover officers. Logan was initially tried and convicted in 2003. Two years later in 2005, the decision was overturned on appeal and Logan attended a second trial. Logan was subsequently convicted again and sentenced to 30 years. Arnaud was posthumously promoted to [[Sergeant]].
