'''Madeline Kneberg Lewis''' (1903-1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Tennessee]]. She is most famous for her work on excavations in the [[Tennessee Valley]], beginning in the 1930s. She was instrumental in establishing the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee as well as the [[Frank H. McClung Museum]]. She was the first female full professor at Tennessee outside of [[home economics]] and among the first prominent female archaeologists in the United States.<ref>Chapman, J. 1996. <U+201C>Madeline D. Kneberg Lewis, 1903-1996.<U+201D> SAA Bulletin 14(5), http://www.saa.org/Portals/0/SAA/publications/SAAbulletin/14-5/SAA12.html Accessed 18 Nov 2012.</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Kneberg was born in 1903 in [[Moline, Illinois]] to artist and interior designer Charles Kneberg and his wife Ann (married 1879).<ref>Illinois Statewide Marriage Index, http://www.ilsos.gov/isavital/marriageSearch.do Accessed 18 Nov 2012.</ref> She travelled to [[Italy]] in 1924 to study art and music in preparation for a career as a musical performer, but after four years returned to the United States and began training as a nurse at the Presbyterian Hospital of [[Chicago]]. She engaged in to graduate study in [[sociology]] at the [[University of Chicago]], where  she was persuaded to study [[physical anthropology]] under [[Fay-Cooper Cole]], the founder of the university's  Department of Anthropology . There she completed all of the requirements for a PhD save her dissertation, though she published on her graduate school research on hair variability in 1935 and 1936.<ref>Chapman</ref> She taught at [[Beloit College]] in [[Wisconsin]] for one year in 1937 before being taken onto the staff of [[Thomas Lewis]] at the University of Tennessee in 1938, who was working for the [[Works Progress Administration]] on sites inundated by [[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]] projects.<ref>Lyon, E.A. 1996. A New Deal for Southeastern Archaeology. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, p. 141.</ref>

== Tennessee Valley excavations ==
Beginning with the [[Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site|Marksville, Louisiana]] excavations in 1933, money and work crews from a succession of federal relief agencies (the [[Civil Works Administration]], [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]], Works Progress Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, and [[National Park Service]]) were committed to major excavations all over the region.<ref>Ibid., 28.</ref>

The TVA, established in 1933 to provide for navigation, flood control, and rural electrification, was perhaps the most important agency in fostering archaeology in [[Tennessee]] and surrounding states. The agency<U+2019>s dam construction efforts threatened to inundate large numbers of sites, but was persuaded to also engage in [[salvage archeology]],  under the direction of archeological consultant [[William Snyder Webb|William Webb]] of the [[University of Kentucky]].<ref name="Ibid">Ibid., 40.</ref>

Archaeological projects in Tennessee were placed under the responsibility of Tom Lewis at the [[University of Tennessee]].<ref name="Ibid" /> He assembled a staff of archaeologists and physical anthropologists that included Madeline Kneberg, who would take over the management of the university<U+2019>s archaeology laboratory and work closely with Lewis in drafting many of the its most important reports. These included major surveys of the archaeology of the Chickamauga Basin (1941) and of Hiwassee Island (1946). Due to financial constraints and philosophical conflicts with the TVA and Webb, the Chickamauga report was not published in full until 1995.<ref>Ibid., 148.</ref><ref>Sullivan, L. 1995. The Prehistory of the Chickamauga Basin in Tennessee. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.</ref> However, ''Hiwassee Island: An Archaeological Account of Four Tennessee Indian Peoples'' became a classic in the field, established as a model by [[Walter Taylor (archaeologist)|Walter Taylor]] in his widely read ''A Study in Archaeology''.<ref>Lyon, 149.</ref> Kneberg and Lewis also composed a 2,000 page manual for the UT lab, which detailed protocols for all stages of excavation and analysis and described a sophisticated catalog system for sites and artifacts.<ref>Ibid., 151.</ref>

== Later work ==

When WPA funds ran out in 1940, Kneberg joined the UT Division of Anthropology (part of the Department of History) as its second professor, becoming the first female professor at the university outside of home economics. She became the first female full professor in 1950.<ref>Chapman.</ref> In 1947, in large part due to the work of Kneberg and Lewis, the division became a full department. Kneberg continued working on scientific reports, often with Lewis, through the 1950s and early 1960s. She also made major contributions to archaeology in Tennessee as an institution. Kneberg and Lewis were major drivers in the founding of the Tennessee Archaeological Society in 1944, which continues to work to support archaeology and archaeological knowledge in the state and published the annual journal ''Tennessee Archaeologist'' until 1981.<ref name="Ibid_a">Ibid.</ref> In 1950, she collaborated with the [[Eastern Band of the Cherokee]] to reconstruct an 18th Century Cherokee village in [[Cherokee, North Carolina]], which remains an important center for historical re-enactment and cultural tourism. She published popular works during this period that brought Tennessee archaeology to a lay public. The most successful of these, ''Tribes that Slumber: Indian Times in the Tennessee Region'', she both wrote and illustrated, employing skills gained during her early life training as an artist. It remains a bestseller for the [[University of Tennessee Press|UT Press]]. Perhaps her most enduring physical contribution to archaeology in the state was the establishment of the Frank H. McClung Museum (now the [http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/ McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture]) on UT<U+2019>s [[Knoxville]] campus in 1961.<ref name="Ibid_a" />

== Marriage and retirement ==

In 1961, at age 65, Kneberg married her longtime colleague Tom Lewis after what she described as <U+201C>the longest courtship on earth.<U+201D> The same year the couple retired from archaeology and moved to [[Winter Haven, Florida]]. Kneberg Lewis died there in 1996 of heart failure at the age of 93.<ref name="Ibid_a" />

== Honors ==

Kneberg was elected a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1950. In 1995, she was honored at the Southeastern Archaeological Conference with the Distinguished Service Award. The conference dubbed her a <U+201C>founding mother of Southeastern archaeology.<U+201D><ref name="Ibid_a" />
