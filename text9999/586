The '''[[Grumman]] JF "Duck"''' was a single-engine [[amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] biplane.  It first flew in May 1933 and was produced from 1933 until 1935 when it was replaced by the [[Grumman J2F|J2F]].

The Duck's main pontoon was part of the fuselage, making it a [[flying boat]], though it appears more like a standard aircraft with an added float.

It set an amphibian speed record in December 1934, at 191 mph (307 km/h).
