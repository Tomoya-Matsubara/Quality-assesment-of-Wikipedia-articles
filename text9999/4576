[[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]] said: "There comes a time in the life of every youngish actor when he knows he will never play [[James Bond]]. This is not that time. We're still holding out for that, but ''Our Men'' might be good to practice on."<ref name="BBC1" /> [[Robert Webb]] added that "It's sort of ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'' meets ''[[Spooks]]'' at a bad disco and Yes, Prime Minister is a bit sick on Spooks, but Spooks doesn't mind. It's like that."<ref name="BBC1" />

[[Kenton Allen]], the executive producer of the series said: "We<U+2019>re thrilled to announce our first Mitchell and Webb commission, launched with the brilliant writing of James Wood and Rupert Walters. It was always our ambition to move David and Robert into a 60-minute comedy drama so this is a wonderful start to our adventures together."<ref name="BBC1" />

Part of the series was filmed in [[Bursa]] in western Turkey. According to [[AZ Celtic Films]], Bursa was chosen because of its diversity and closeness to [[Istanbul]], which is called the "hub of the film industry".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thelocationguide.com/blog/2013/10/ng-television-mitchell-and-webb-bbc-comedy-ambassadors-films-on-location-in-turkey/ | title=Mitchell and Webb BBC comedy Ambassadors films on location in Turkey | work=The Location Guide | date=8 October 2013 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Goundry, Nick}}</ref> The series received help from the Turkish military and the local airport, where filming took two days. The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] allowed the cast to run a [[read-through]] in one of its grandest rooms.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/can-new-mitchell--webb-comedy-help-the-foreign-office-improve-its-image-8866984.html | title=Can new Mitchell & Webb comedy help the Foreign Office improve its image? | work=The Independent | date=8 October 2013 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Sherwin, Adam}}</ref>

James Wood, the co-writer of the series said "The stories we were told by diplomats were very closely reflected in the series. We ended up with 200 pages of research. We had an amazing week in [[Kazakhstan]] with the Ambassador there."<ref name="Independent" /> According to [[Craig Murray]], a former ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], [[Big Talk Productions]] tried to buy the rights to ''[[Murder in Samarkand]]'' for a film and believes the series is based on his book.<ref name="Independent" /> He also thought the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had backed the comedy to "defuse the horror of our alliance with Uzbekistan and make it banal, accepted and safe".<ref name="Independent" />
