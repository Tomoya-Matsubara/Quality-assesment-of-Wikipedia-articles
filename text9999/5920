Being younger brother of the Emperor [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Th<U+00E1>nh T<U+00F4>ng]], Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t was one of the most important figures of Tr<U+1EA7>n family and royal court during the reigns of four successive emperors Th<U+00E1>nh T<U+00F4>ng, [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+00E2>n T<U+00F4>ng|Nh<U+00E2>n T<U+00F4>ng]], [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Anh T<U+00F4>ng|Anh T<U+00F4>ng]] and [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Minh T<U+00F4>ng|Minh T<U+00F4>ng]]. In the second war of resistance against [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Mongol invasion]], Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t was the general who commanded <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t army to defeat the navy of Mongol general [[Sogetu]] in [[Battle of H<U+00E0>m T<U+1EED>]], one of the biggest victories of Tr<U+1EA7>n Dynasty. With his knowledge of numerous foreign languages and cultures, Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n was also a prominent diplomat of Tr<U+1EA7>n Dynasty who helped the Emperor to maintain good relations with several ethnic groups in the northwestern region of <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t.

== Background ==
Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t was born in 1255 as the sixth son of the Emperor [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Th<U+00E1>i T<U+00F4>ng]]. According to ''[[<U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t s<U+1EED> k<U+00ED> to<U+00E0>n th<U+01B0>]]'', Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t was born with four [[H<U+00E1>n t<U+1EF1>|characters]] "Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n <U+0111><U+1ED3>ng t<U+1EED>" ("pupil of Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n") in his arm,<ref name=Ngo172>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=172}}</ref> that's why he was entitled Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n v<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng) in 1268.<ref name=Ngo180>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=180}}</ref> Besides the Emperor [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Th<U+00E1>nh T<U+00F4>ng]], Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t had two other famous elder brothers, Prince Chi<U+00EA>u Minh (Chi<U+00EA>u Minh v<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng) [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Quang Kh<U+1EA3>i]] who was grand chancellor of royal court<ref name=Ngo181>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=181}}</ref> and Prince Chi<U+00EA>u Qu<U+1ED1>c (Chi<U+00EA>u Qu<U+1ED1>c v<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng) [[Tr<U+1EA7>n <U+00CD>ch T<U+1EAF>c]] who was broadly known not only for his intelligence<ref name=Ngo180>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=180}}</ref> but also for his notorious defection to [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] side during the second [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Mongol invasion of <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t]].<ref name=Ngo193>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=193}}</ref>

Since he was young, Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t began to make friends with many foreigners from [[Champa]] or [[Song Dynasty]] with whom he could discuss by their own languages and customs.<ref name=Ngo241>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=241}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=History, culture, and region in Southeast Asian perspectives|first=O.

== History ==
=== Diplomatic activities ===
Two years after the coronation of [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+00E2>n T<U+00F4>ng]] in 1278, head of [[<U+0110><U+00E0> Giang]] [[Tr<U+1ECB>nh Gi<U+00E1>c M<U+1EAD>t]] rose a revolt against Tr<U+1EA7>n rulers. Being an expert of minority people's language and culture, Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t was appointed by Nh<U+00E2>n T<U+00F4>ng to take charge of pacifying this revolt by diplomatic means. At the age of 25, Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t went directly into the headquarters of Tr<U+1ECB>nh Gi<U+00E1>c M<U+1EAD>t with only several servants and discussed with the head of revolt by his own language and manner. Tr<U+1ECB>nh Gi<U+00E1>c M<U+1EAD>t and his men were so impressed by Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t that they decided to unconditionally surrender Tr<U+1EA7>n Dynasty and the revolt was since put down without any casualty. After the pacification, Tr<U+1ECB>nh Gi<U+00E1>c M<U+1EAD>t and his family were still well treated by Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t, therefore Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n gradually became a respected figure among ethnic groups in the northwestern region.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=186-187}}</ref>

=== Military activities ===
In 1279, Yuan Dynasty had the decisive victory over [[Song Dynasty]] in [[Battle of Yamen]] which marked the end of Song Dynasty and the total control of [[Kublai Khan]] over [[China]].<ref name=Ngo186>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=186}}</ref> As a result, Kublai Khan began to expose his attempt to take over the southern countries like [[<U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t]] or [[Champa]]. In December 1284, the second Yuan's invasion of <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t was opended under the command of Kublai Khan's prince [[Toghan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|pp=189-190}}</ref> <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t was attacked in two directions, Toghan himselft conducted the infantry invaded from the northern border while Yuan's navy under general [[Sogetu]] advanced from the sourthern border through [[Champa]]'s territory.<ref name=Ngo193>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=193}}</ref> At the beginning of the war, Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n took charge of a military base near the northern border, thanks to his accurate judgment, Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t's troops was able to escape the trap of Yuan army and successfully retreated.<ref name=Ngo4142>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=241-242}}</ref> Ultimately Sogetu's army suffered heavy defeat in [[Battle of H<U+00E0>m T<U+1EED>]] where Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t commanded an allied troops of <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t soldiers and former Song refugees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|pp=193-194}}</ref><ref name=Chapuis83>{{Harvnb|Chapuis|1995|p=83}}</ref><ref name=Tran58>{{Harvnb|Tr<U+1EA7>n Tr<U+1ECD>ng Kim|1971|p=58}}</ref>

During the reign of [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Anh T<U+00F4>ng]], Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n and general [[Ph<U+1EA1>m Ng<U+0169> L<U+00E3>o]] were responsible for the quelling some rebellions in northern region.<ref name=Ngo207>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=207}}</ref>

=== In royal court ===
Holding several high positions during the reigns of four successive emperors Th<U+00E1>nh T<U+00F4>ng, Nh<U+00E2>n T<U+00F4>ng, Anh T<U+00F4>ng and [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Minh T<U+00F4>ng|Minh T<U+00F4>ng]], Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n became an important figures of both royal family and royal court, he was appointed as grand chancellor in 1302 during the reign of Anh T<U+00F4>ng.<ref name=Ngo216>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n|1993|p=216}}</ref> Since the other sons of Anh T<U+00F4>ng all died at a young age, the Emperor had Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t take the duty of bringing up [[crown prince]] [[Tr<U+1EA7>n M<U+1EA1>nh]], his only surviving son. Indeed Prince Tr<U+1EA7>n M<U+1EA1>nh was well looked after due to the whohearted devotion of Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t and finally became the Emperor Tr<U+1EA7>n Minh T<U+00F4>ng.<ref name=Ngo215>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4>|1993|p=215}}</ref> It was also Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t and [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Qu<U+1ED1>c T<U+00FA>]] who assisted the 12-year-old Crown Prince Tr<U+1EA7>n M<U+1EA1>nh in ruling the country when Anh T<U+00F4>ng was away for a military campaign against [[Champa]] in 1312.<ref name=Ngo224>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4>|1993|p=224}}</ref>

Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t died in 1330 at the age of 77.<ref name=Ngo240>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4>|1993|p=240}}</ref>

== Family ==
Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t had one wife, Lady Trinh T<U+00FA>c, who was of [[Thanh H<U+00F3>a]] origin, so his other concubines all came from Thanh H<U+00F3>a and descendants of Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n were often appointed as officials in this region.<ref name=Ngo242>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4>|1993|p=242}}</ref> The only son of Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t is Marquis C<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng <U+0110><U+00F4>ng V<U+0103>n Hi<U+1EBF>n (C<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng <U+0110><U+00F4>ng V<U+0103>n Hi<U+1EBF>n h<U+1EA7>u), who plotted with [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Kh<U+1EAF>c Chung]] the defamation campaign which led to the death of [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Qu<U+1ED1>c Ch<U+1EA9>n]], father-in-law of the Emperor and prominent general, in order to keep the position of throne successor for prince [[Tr<U+1EA7>n V<U+01B0><U+1EE3>ng]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ng<U+00F4>|1993|pp=236-237}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
In his work ''<U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t s<U+1EED> k<U+00ED> to<U+00E0>n th<U+01B0>'', the royal historian [[Ng<U+00F4> S<U+0129> Li<U+00EA>n]] praised Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t as not only a capable official but also a gentleman of intelligence and culture. Despite holding high position in royal court for many years, Prince Chi<U+00EA>u V<U+0103>n always kept an amiable, tolerant attitude and was well-known as a scholar with wide knowledge. Therefore he was compared with [[Guo Ziyi]], one of the greatest generals and mandarins in [[Chinese history]].<ref name=Ngo4142/> Modern opinions still consider Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t, together with [[Tr<U+1EA7>n H<U+01B0>ng <U+0110><U+1EA1>o]] and [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Quang Kh<U+1EA3>i]], as the most important members of Tr<U+1EA7>n clan who were credited with the victories over Yuan Dynasty and the prosperous situation in <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t afterwards. A main street in [[Hanoi]] and many places in Vietnam are named in honour of Tr<U+1EA7>n Nh<U+1EAD>t Du<U+1EAD>t.
