"'''Jump'''" is a song recorded by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]] for her seventh studio album, ''[[Unapologetic]]'' (2012). It was written by Kevin Cossum, M. B. Williams, [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]] and [[Chase & Status]], with production done by the latter two and [[Kuk Harrell]]. It is a [[dubstep]] song which [[Sample (music)|samples]] the lyrics of "[[Pony (Ginuwine song)|Pony]]" (1996), a song performed by [[Ginuwine]]. Its composition and structure received comparisons to not only [[Justin Timberlake]]'s song "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]" and [[Magnetic Man]], "[[I Need Air]]", but also to some of Rihanna's previous songs, including "[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]" and "[[Red Lipstick]]". A remix of the song called "Jump (Club Cheval Rap Remix)" by rapper [[Theophilus London]]  was leaked onto the internet.

The song received mostly positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Many reviewers thought that "Jump" stood out as one of a couple of highlights on ''Unapologetic'', while a few others singled it out as the sole highlight. However, it prompted a mixed reaction from James Montgomery for [[MTV]], who thought that the dubstep bass line produced a "mixed result". Genevieve Koski for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', who wrote that the track should not have been included on the album as it is a poor song choice, commented that songs like "Jump" are responsible for simply furthering her career in the music industry. Following the release of  ''Unapologetic'', "Jump" debuted on the [[French Singles Chart]] at number 153 and the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 150 due to strong digital download sales.
