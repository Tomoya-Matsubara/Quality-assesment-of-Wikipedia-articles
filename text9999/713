'''''Les raboteurs de parquet'''''  (English title: ''The Floor Scrapers'') is an [[oil painting]] by French [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[Gustave Caillebotte]]. The [[canvas]] measures {{convert|102|x|146.5|cm|in}}. It was originally gifted by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Luxembourg]], then transferred to the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre]] in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], and in 1986, it was transferred again to the [[Mus<U+00E9>e d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]], where it is currently displayed.<ref name="MO2">{{cite web | url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&nnumid=105 | title=Notice of the work | publisher=musee-orsay.fr|date=2011 | accessdate=July 24, 2012 | date = 16 February 2009}}</ref>

Painted in 1875, this work illustrates Caillebotte's continued interest in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and everyday life. In the scene, the observer stands above three workers on hands and knees, scraping a wooden floor in a [[bourgeois]] apartment<U+2014>now believed to be Caillebotte's own studio at 77, [[rue de Miromesnil]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].{{sfn|Marrinan|2002|p=22|ps=. Marrinan also gives an address of 15, rue de Lisbonne (p. 25), which is at the same street corner.}} A window on the back wall admits natural light. The workers are all shown with nude torsos and tilted heads, suggesting a conversation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/gustave-caillebottes-floor-scrapers.html | title=Caillebotte: The Floor Scrapers - Smarthistory | publisher=Khan Academy | accessdate=July 24, 2012 | author=Giuntini, Parma and Robert Summers}}</ref> This is one of the first paintings to feature the urban [[working class]].<ref name=MO>{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/les-raboteurs-de-parquet-7073.html|accessdate=24 July 2012|date=25 March 2009|title=Gustave Caillebotte: The Floor Planers|publisher=musee-orsay.fr}}</ref> There is a [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] of curls in the image, from the wood shavings on the floor, to the pattern of ironwork in the window grill to the arched backs and arms of the workers.{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=55}} The repetition in the image, with the three workers engaged in different aspects of the same activity but having similar poses, is similar to works by Caillebotte's contemporary, [[Edgar Degas]].{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=55}}

Despite the effort Caillebotte put into the painting, it was rejected by France's most prestigious art exhibition, [[Salon (Paris)|the Salon]], in 1875. The depiction of working class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a "vulgar subject matter".<ref name=MO/> He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, with whom he had already associated himself, in 1876.{{sfn|Marrinan|2002|p=28}} He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a [[:File:Gustave Caillebotte-Floor-scrapers (1876).jpg|second, different version of ''Raboteurs'']] from 1876, and his earlier work ''[[:File:G. Caillebotte - Jeune homme <U+00E0> la fen<U+00EA>tre.jpg|Jeune homme <U+00E0> la fen<U+00EA>tre]]'' (''Young Man at the Window''){{sfn|Herbert|1991|p=19}} The images of the floor scrapers came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as "vulgar."{{sfn|Herbert|1991|p=19}}

The painting divided opinion in Parisian art circles. Among the detractors, [[Emile Porchoron]], a critic of Impressionism, damned Caillebotte with faint praise: "the least bad of the exhibition. One of the missions Impressionism seems to have set for itself is to torture perspective: you see here what results can be obtained."{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=185}} [[<U+00C9>mile Zola]] praised the technical execution, but then called it "an anti-artistic painting, painting as neat as glass, bourgeois painting, because of the exactitude of the copying."{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=187}} [[Louis <U+00C9>nault]] was not troubled by the depiction ("The subject matter is certainly vulgar, but we can understand how it might tempt a painter") but did find fault with the image's fidelity to the scene: "I only regret that the artist did not choose his types better... The arms of the planers are too thin, and their chests too narrow... may your [[depictions of nudity|nude]] be handsome or don't get involved with it!"{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=186}}

The painting received praise from many critics, though. Regarding the Salon rejection, poet and critic [[<U+00C9>mile Bl<U+00E9>mont]] called the decision "[a] very bad mark for the official jurors".{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=186}} [[Maurice Chaumelin]] compared Caillebotte favorably to his contemporaries, writing that the work showed that he was "a realist just as raw, but much more witty, than [[Courbet]], just as violent, but altogether more precise, than [[Manet]]."{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=185}} [[Philippe Burty]] made comparisons to an even earlier generation of artists: "His pictures are original in their composition, but, more than that, so energetic as to drawing that they resemble the early [[Florentine school|Florentine]]s."{{sfn|Varnedoe|2000|p=186}}
