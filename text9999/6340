'''Juxtlahuaca''' is a cave and [[archaeological site]] in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Guerrero]] containing [[mural]]s linked to the [[Olmec]] motifs and iconography. Along with the nearby [[Oxtotitl<U+00E1>n]] cave, Juxtlahuaca walls contain the earliest sophisticated painted art known in [[Mesoamerica]],<ref>Grove (2000).</ref> and only known example of non-[[Maya civilization|Maya]] deep [[cave painting|cave art]] in Mesoamerica.<ref>Stone (1997).</ref>

==The cave==
The Juxtlahuaca site is located some 45 km southeast of state capital [[Chilpancingo]] in what is now a National Park. The entire cave system is slightly over 5 kilometres.  The caves, also called '''Grutas de Juxtlahuaca''' ("Grottos of Juxtlahuaca"), are a favorite destination of [[spelunkers]].  The caves are open to the public, but a local guide is required.

The site's paintings have been estimated to be over a kilometre down a long cavern: descent times are roughly two hours and some passages are partially filled with water.

==The paintings==
The most well-known of the cave art is Painting 1, which features a large bearded man with a black cloak, a striped tunic, and an elaborate headpiece. The arms and legs are covered with [[jaguar]] fur, and a small jaguar tail is even visible dangling down. The man is brandishing a [[trident]] at a much smaller figure crouched to his side and is carrying a long snake or snakelike object.<ref>Some have seen this as a rope that is tied to the smaller figure: [[flowstone]] may have obscured the object so that it is presently seen as a snake-like object and a belt around the smaller figure.</ref>  This 2 meter (6 foot) tall painting is one of the rare Olmec-style portrayals of human-on-human dominance,<ref>The other two prominent displays of human-on-human domination are [[Chalcatzingo]]'s Monument 2 and Altar 4 at [[La Venta]].</ref> which some researchers interpret as a scene of human sacrifice.<ref>Coe (2005).</ref> 

Also of note in Juxtlahuaca is a painting of a red [[Olmec mythology|Feathered Serpent]] with green plumes, near a red jaguar whose large ears and eyes give it a youthful cast.  A design that has provisionally been interpreted as a temple was found on a stalagmite.<ref>Griffin, p.4.</ref>

The cave paintings have been known since at least the 1920s, but were first professionally documented in the early 1960s by Gillett Griffin of [[Princeton University]] and Carlo T. E. Gay, an Italian businessman. Archaeologist [[Michael D. Coe]] has estimated that the paintings "might probably be [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Preclassic]] (1200-900 BC, uncalibrated)" in date.<ref>Coe (2005).</ref> Juxtalhuaca is, so far as is known, unassociated with any large town of that period. It is also not known how Olmec-influenced art came to be painted hundreds of kilometres (or miles) from the [[Olmec heartland]]. Caves are prominent on many Olmec-style monuments: several Olmec "[[La Venta#Altars 4 & 5|altar]]s" depict [[shaman]]s or rulers emerging from caves, and monuments and reliefs at the archaeological site of [[Chalcatzingo]], to the north of Juxtlahuaca, also feature cave [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s.

==Other artifacts==
A dozen skeletons have been found in the so-called Hall of the Dead, located midway between the entrance and the paintings.  From their positions, some extended and some in a fetal position, and their condition, covered with a stalactite crust, the skeletons are assumed to be ancient burials.  Some have been partially buried as a result of a cave-in.<ref>Coe (1968), p. 99.</ref>

Just before the paintings, an 250-foot (80 m) artificial canal has been cut into the red clay floor of the cave.  The purpose of this canal is not known.
