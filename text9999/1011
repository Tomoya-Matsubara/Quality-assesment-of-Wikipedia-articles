'''"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked"''' is the twelfth episode of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|sixth season]] of the American [[medical drama]] ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and the 114th episode overall. It was written by [[Tony Phelan]] and [[Joan Rater]], directed by [[Donna Deitch]], and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States on January 21, 2010. In "I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked", [[Dr. Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) returns to the fictional Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital with the fear that her estranged husband [[Dr. Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) is moving on.

The episode was originally intended to serve as the beginning of Heigl's [[maternity leave]], but was later marked as her final appearance to the series. [[Kim Raver]] ([[Dr. Teddy Altman]]) reprised her role as a guest star, in addition to [[Jesse Williams]] ([[Jackson Avery|Dr. Jackson Avery]]) and [[Mitch Pileggi]] (Larry Jennings). The title of the episode refers to the song, "[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]", by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Rock music|rock]] musician, [[Ida Maria]].

==Plot==
{{Double image|left|Ellen Pompeo LF.JPG|136|Patrick Dempsey cropped.jpg|146|The episode tested the marriage of [[Ellen Pompeo]] (''left'') and [[Patrick Dempsey]]'s (''right'') characters.}}
The episode begins with [[general surgery|general surgeon]] [[Dr. Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) performing a special surgery, and to her dismay, the chief of surgery [[Dr. Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) is absent from the operating room. At [[Dr. Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]])'s house, [[Dr. Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) is engaging in sexual activity with [[Dr. Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), while his wife, [[Dr. Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) is estranged. In the next room, Meredith begins arguing with her husband, [[Dr. Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), over whether or not he should report the chief of surgery, [[Dr. Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]])'s [[alcoholism]] to Larry Jennings ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), the hospital's president. [[Dr. Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) returns home after being on a hiatus, due to her being fired from the hospital, to rekindle her relationship with Karev. [[Dr. Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ram<U+00ED>rez]]) and [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]) are being intimate in the hospital's [[on-call room]], until Torres discovers that she has the [[chicken pox]]. Robbins places her in isolation, because she wants a "sexy" relationship, and does not think the chicken pox can account to that. 

Meredith is set to perform a [[Pancreaticoduodenectomy]] procedure with [[Jackson Avery|Dr. Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams]]), under the supervision of Webber, but under the influence of alcohol, he falls asleep, and Bailey performs the surgery. In an effort to reason with Meredith, Shepherd offers her a proposition. Shepherd is aware that he will receive Webber's job if he is reported, and therefore will be in charge of hiring. He explains to Meredith that if she lets him report the chief, he will let Stevens re-obtain her job. Stevens enters the hospital to receive a [[PET scan]], due to her [[cancer]]. When it is revealed that she is now cancer-free, her happiness leads Meredith to allowing Shepherd to report Webber. In the previous episode, "Blink", [[Dr. Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) told [[cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]] [[Dr. Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]) that she could have [[Dr. Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), her boyfriend, if she continued to work at Seattle Grace Mercy West. An appalled Altman reveals this to Hunt, however, him and Yang subsequently mend their relationship, and Altman continues to work at the hospital. Lexie meets up with [[Dr. Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), her ex-boyfriend, and reveals that she had sex with Karev. Sloan reveals that he too was involved in sexual activity, but is unable to forgive Lexie. At the conclusion of the work-day, Stevens approaches Karev, seeking reconciliation, but he explains that he does not deserve to be treated the way he was, and asks her to leave. Meredith informs Stevens that she is getting her job back, but disinterested, Stevens departs, seeking a fresh start to life.

While writing the scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting, Rater explained that she was intending to show how they matured, adding: "This is a real grown-up argument. Meredith isn't running away, getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage. She's staying and fighting."<ref name=Matter>{{cite web | url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html | title=Joan Rater on "I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked"... | publisher=ABC | work=Grey Matter | date=January 21, 2010 | accessdate=June 26, 2012 | author=Rater, Joan}}</ref> While writing the episode, writers intended the [[theme (literature)|theme]] of the episode to be "exposure", but after the episode was filmed, realized it was "ambition".<ref name=Matter/> Rater commented on this: "Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn<U+2019>t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay."<ref name=Matter/> In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery. The ''Grey{{'s}} Anatomy'' staff offered the insight: "When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down drag out fight in the writers' room <U+2013> if you had to choose your love or your art, which would you choose? And some of us came down on the Cristina side, and some of us came down on the Izzie side <U+2013> that in the end love is all that matters."<ref name=Matter/> At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens. Rater expressed her thoughts on the subject: {{quote|"Izzie getting the clean scan back gives Alex the freedom to leave. Because he never would have left her when she was sick, he's a good guy. And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can<U+2019>t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, it just comes to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. We talked about the fact that Alex grew up in a pretty dysfunctional family and he was probably in a lot of bad relationships where he wasn<U+2019>t a good guy, so he had come to believe it. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done."|Joan Rater|''Grey Matter''<ref name=Matter/>}}
