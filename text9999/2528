==Managerial career==

===British Virgin Islands===
Villas-Boas had his first job as [[British Virgin Islands national football team|British Virgin Islands]] head coach when only 21 years of age in 1998. In 1999, he resigned as [[manager (association football)|manager]].<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/virgin-islands-recall-their-days-in-the-sun-under-former-coach-2301208.html Virgin Islands recall their days in the sun under former coach]. ''The Independent''.</ref>

===Acad<U+00E9>mica===
[[File:Villas-Boas.JPG|thumb|Andr<U+00E9> Villas-Boas at a [[F.C. Porto|Porto]] press conference.]]
At the start of the [[2009<U+2013>10 Premier League|2009<U+2013>10 season]], Villas-Boas left Mourinho's team to pursue a career as a manager, and he soon found a job in the [[Primeira Liga]] with [[Associa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Acad<U+00E9>mica de Coimbra&nbsp;<U+2013> O.A.F.|Acad<U+00E9>mica de Coimbra]], filling a vacancy created by [[Rog<U+00E9>rio Gon<U+00E7>alves]]' resignation in October 2009.<ref name="uefa" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-academica-news/4682-andre-villas-boas-new-academica-boss |title=Academica appoint Andre Villas-Boas as head coach |publisher=PortuGOAL.net |accessdate=18 December 2010 |date=14 October 2009}}</ref> At the time of his appointment, Acad<U+00E9>mica were at the bottom of the league and still without any wins, but their luck started to change as he introduced a new style, leading them to a safe 11th place, ten points clear of the relegation zone. In addition to that, Acad<U+00E9>mica also reached the [[2009<U+2013>10 Ta<U+00E7>a da Liga|2009<U+2013>10 Portuguese League Cup]] semi-finals, losing against Porto at the [[Est<U+00E1>dio do Drag<U+00E3>o]] to a late goal from [[Mariano Gonz<U+00E1>lez]]. His impact at Acad<U+00E9>mica was immediate, not only because of solid results, but also because of the attractive football displayed by the team, which led to intense media speculation linking him with the vacant jobs at [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] and [[F.C. Porto|FC Porto]] in the summer of 2010.<ref name="uefa" />

===Porto===
Villas-Boas signed a deal to become the new manager of [[F.C. Porto|Porto]] on 2 June 2010.<ref name="uefa" /> Two months later, he won his first trophy as a manager when Porto defeated [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] 2<U+2013>0 to win the [[Portuguese Supercup]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/407902/Live |title= His first trophy in Porto, Porto 2<U+2013>0 Benfica | publisher= Whoscored.com}}</ref> Villas-Boas went on to immense success with Porto, leading them to an undefeated season in the [[Primeira Liga]] - only the second time this had ever been achieved - and winning the title by more than 20 points, having conceded only 13 goals all season. Villas-Boas went on to follow up this success by leading Porto to win both the [[2011 Ta<U+00E7>a de Portugal Final|Portuguese Cup]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]], thus completing a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in his first season in charge. By doing so, Villas-Boas became the third-youngest coach ever to win the Primeira Liga (behind Mih<U+00E1>ly Siska in [[1938<U+2013>39 Primeira Liga|1939]] and [[Juca]] in [[1961<U+2013>62 Primeira Liga|1962]]) and the youngest manager ever to win a European competition, at the age of 33 years and 213 days.<ref name="soccernet.espn.go.com"/><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/423279/Live |title= Champions of Liga Sagres,2010<U+2013>11,  Benfica 1<U+2013>2 Porto | publisher= Whoscored.com}}</ref> On 21 June 2011, Villas-Boas tendered his resignation as Porto manager.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/929431/porto's-andre-villas-boas-hands-in-resignation-for-chelsea-move?cc=5739|title=Villas-Boas resigns from Porto|date=21 June 2011|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|accessdate=21 June 2011}}</ref>

===Chelsea===
[[File:Andr<U+00E9> Villas-Boas-Feb 2012.jpg|thumb|Villas-Boas during his time at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], shortly before he was sacked.]]
[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] confirmed the appointment of Villas Boas as their new manager on a three-year contract with immediate effect on 22 June 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jun/22/chelsea-confirm-andre-villas-boas|title=Chelsea appoint former Porto coach Andr<U+00E9> Villas-Boas on three-year deal|date=22 June 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2011|location=London|first=Paul|last=Doyle}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2380210,00.html|title=Villas-Boas appointed|publisher=Chelsea F.C|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> They indirectly paid Porto [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]15{{nbsp}}million ([[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]13.3{{nbsp}}million) compensation via Villas-Boas to activate his release clause and free him from his contract with Porto.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11668_6999591,00.html |title=Chelsea close on Villas-Boas |publisher=Sky Sports |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref> On 30 July 2011, during the [[Season (sports)|pre-season]], Villas-Boas won his first piece of silverware with Chelsea, the [[2011 Barclays Asia Trophy]]. Villas-Boas won all of his pre-season fixtures with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], with the team conceding only one goal in all six games.

On 14 August, Villas-Boas's first [[Premier League]] match ended in a 0<U+2013>0 at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], with Villas-Boas commenting on Stoke's strong defence at home. Villas-Boas then won his first competitive match as Chelsea manager, defeating [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 2<U+2013>1 on 20 August. He continued his season with a back-to-back home wins beating [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] 3<U+2013>1. On 18 September 2011, Villas-Boas's Chelsea lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 3<U+2013>1 at [[Old Trafford]]. It was Chelsea's first defeat of the season and Villas-Boas's first defeat in 39 league matches, a run stretching back to his spells as manager of Acad<U+00E9>mica and Porto. On 29 October, Chelsea lost their second [[Arsenal F.C.<U+2013>Chelsea F.C. rivalry|derby]] under Villas-Boas in a 5<U+2013>3 defeat at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] after falling to a 1<U+2013>0 defeat to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. Then three weeks later, his Chelsea side lost a second successive home game in a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Days later, he once again lost to Liverpool in a 2<U+2013>0 defeat in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] quarter-final.

On 11 February 2012, pressure began to mount on Villas-Boas as Chelsea dropped out of the top four in the Premier League following a 2<U+2013>0 league defeat against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Villas-Boas responded by cancelling his squad's day off and called them in for an inquest, which provoked several senior players to question his tactics in front of owner [[Roman Abramovich]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/news/five-matches-led-villas-boass-dismissal-175352111--soccer.html |title=Five matches that led to Villas-Boas's dismissal |publisher=AFP News |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref> On 21 February 2012, during a [[UEFA Champions League]] match against [[Napoli]] Villas-Boas left [[Frank Lampard]], [[Michael Essien]] and [[Ashley Cole]] on the bench.

On the Chelsea website it read: "The board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2633044,00.html |title=Chelsea and AVB part company |publisher=Chelsea F.C |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 3 July 2012, it was announced that Villas-Boas had been named [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] Head Coach after successful talks with the club, penning a three-year deal with the North London football team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jul/03/tottenham-andre-villas-boas-manager?newsfeed=true|title=Andr<U+00E9> Villas-Boas starts life at Spurs by targeting Jo<U+00E3>o Moutinho|date=4 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=4 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18610066|title=Andre Villas-Boas: Tottenham name Portuguese as new manager|date=4 July 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 July 2012 }}</ref> Villas-Boas' first competitive game in charge of Tottenham came on 18 August 2012 in the opening day of the Premier League season, losing 2<U+2013>1 to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] away from home.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19221418|title=Newcastle 2-1 Tottenham|date=18 August 2012|publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref> His first competitive win came on 16 September 2012, a 3<U+2013>1 victory away to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19491534|title=Reading 1-3 Tottenham|date=16 September 2012|publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref>

Despite taking the lead early on, goalscorer [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] was sent off just eight minutes later, and Tottenham eventually lost 5<U+2013>2.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20278355|title=Arsenal 5-2 Tottenham|date=17 November 2012|publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref>
Villas-Boas got his first piece of personal Tottenham silverware when he picked up the Manager of the month award for December. The team managed to pick up vital points in order to pursue their top four ambition. Promising big scorelines away from home such as Fulham, Aston Villa and Sunderland along with home wins against Swansea and Reading, left Tottenham in third going into the new year. One minor set back was a tough trip to Goodison Park, where the lilywhites were leading up until the 90th minute, then two late Everton goals in as many minutes, snatched victory away from the North London side.

In February 2013, he guided Tottenham to the last 16 of the Europa League after a last minute goal from Mousa Demb<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>, securing a 1-1 draw at the Stade Gerland. Spurs won the tie 3-2 on aggregate, after a 2-1 win at home the previous week. Following a 3-2 away win at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]], Tottenham's third win from 3 Premier League matches that month, Villas-Boas picked up his second piece of personal Tottenham silverware of the season as he was awarded the Manager of the Month award for February, along with [[Gareth Bale]] who picked up the Player of the Month award for February as well.<ref name="manager-month-feb13">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21632265 |title=Gareth Bale & Andre Villas-Boas earn player and manager awards |publisher=BBC Sport |work=bbc.co.uk |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013 }}</ref>
