==Plot==
Tem<U+00FC>jin ([[Tadanobu Asano]]) as a prisoner in the [[Western Xia|Tangut kingdom]], conveys his memories about his earlier life through a series of flashbacks.

Embarking on an expedition as a young boy, Tem<U+00FC>jin ([[Odnyam Odsuren]]) is accompanied by his father [[Yes<U+00FC>gei]] ([[Ba Sen]]) to select a girl as his future wife. Tem<U+00FC>jin meets and chooses [[B<U+00F6>rte]] ([[Bayertsetseg Erdenebat]]), although his father wishes him to choose a mate from the [[Merkit people|Merkit]] tribe. Tem<U+00FC>jin convinces his father to allow him to choose B<U+00F6>rte. He promises to return after five years to marry her. On their way home, Tem<U+00FC>jin's father is poisoned by an enemy tribe. As he lies dying, he tells Tem<U+00FC>jin that he is now [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. However, one of his father's warriors, Targutai ([[Amadu Mamadakov]]), orders the other tribesmen to loot the dead Khan's camp. Targutai spares Tem<U+00FC>jin's life, declaring a Mongol does not kill children. After falling through the ice of a frozen lake, Tem<U+00FC>jin is found lying down in the snow by a young boy called [[Jamukha]] ([[Amarbold Tuvshinbayar]]). The two quickly become friends and perform a traditional ceremony declaring themselves blood brothers. Targutai later captures Tem<U+00FC>jin, holding him in captivity. Tem<U+00FC>jin however, escapes late one night and roams the countryside. Tem<U+00FC>jin is later seen again as a young man (Tadanobu Asano) in 1186. He once again is apprehended by Targutai, who wishes to kill him now that he is grown. Tem<U+00FC>jin escapes a second time finding B<U+00F6>rte ([[Khulan Chuluun]]), and brings her back to his family. Later that night, they are attacked by the Merkit tribe led by Chiledu ([[Sai Xing Ga]]), since Tem<U+00FC>jin's father had years before stolen his wife from one of their tribesmen. While being chased on horseback, Tem<U+00FC>jin is shot with an arrow. B<U+00F6>rte whips the horse which Tem<U+00FC>jin is on, telling it to go home. B<U+00F6>rte is captured by the Merkit leader, as Tem<U+00FC>jin returns safely to his family.<ref name="film">[[Sergei Bodrov]]. (2007). ''Mongol'' [Motion picture]. Russia: [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse Entertainment]].</ref>

Tem<U+00FC>jin goes to his childhood friend Jamukha ([[Sun Honglei]]), who is now a Khan himself. Jamukha agrees to help him get his wife back and attack the Merkit tribe, though only after a year passes. The attack on the Merkit tribe is a success, and Tem<U+00FC>jin finds B<U+00F6>rte alive and Chiledu dead. However, just as he feared, Bort<U+00EB> has already been raped and left pregnant with Chiledu's son, who Tem<U+00FC>jin takes as his own. Tem<U+00FC>jin and his men leave early the next morning, and two of Jamukha's soldiers choose to join Tem<U+00FC>jin because he distributes more plunder to his warriors than Jamukha. Jamukha chases down Tem<U+00FC>jin, but Tem<U+00FC>jin refuses to send back Jamukha's combatants and horses because he explains a Mongol warrior is free to choose his leader. Jamukha warns him that his actions will lead to future conflict. Taichar ([[Bu Ren]]), Jamukha's brother, is later killed while attempting to steal back Jamukha's horses; Jamukha and Tem<U+00FC>jin go to war. Outnumbered, Tem<U+00FC>jin's army is quickly defeated. Jamukha declares victory and decides to make Tem<U+00FC>jin a slave rather than execute him.<ref name="film"/>

Tem<U+00FC>jin is sold to a Tangut Garrison Chief ([[Zhang Jiong]]), despite the dire warning given to the man by a Buddhist monk ([[Ben Hon Sun]]) acting as his advisor. While imprisoned, the monk pleads with Tem<U+00FC>jin to save his monastery when he is set free sometime in the future. In exchange for delivering a bone fragment to B<U+00F6>rte indicating that he is still alive, Tem<U+00FC>jin agrees. To get to Tangut, B<U+00F6>rte becomes a merchant's concubine, bearing a daughter along the way. Once B<U+00F6>rte arrives in Tangut, she abandons the merchant and bribes the guard for the key to Tem<U+00FC>jin's cell. Once freed, he gathers an army to unify all of the Mongols. In 1196, Tem<U+00FC>jin declares war over Jamukha. By 1206, Tem<U+00FC>jin defeats Jamukha (though he sets him free), while Targutai is killed by his own soldiers while attempting to flee the battle. Tem<U+00FC>jin is subsequently designated the Khan of all the Mongols<U+2013>''[[Genghis Khan]] of the Great Steppe''.<ref name="film"/>

===Development===
[[File:Sergei Vladimirovich Bodrov.jpg|170px|left|thumb|Director Sergei Bodrov]]
The premise of ''Mongol'' is based on the true story of Genghis Khan, the Mongol leader who founded the [[Mongol Empire]], which ruled expansive areas of [[Central Asia]] and China.<ref name="MongolMov">[http://mongolmovie.com/ About the Film] ''Mongol'' (Picturehouse). Retrieved 2011-02-20.</ref> The film depicts a portrait of the early life of Tem<U+00FC>jin; not as an evil war-mongering brute, but rather an inspiring visionary leader.<ref name="MongolMov"/> Director Bodrov noted that "Russians lived under Mongolian rule for around 200 years" and that "Genghis Khan was portrayed as a monster". During the 1990s, Bodrov read a book by Russian historian [[Lev Gumilev]] entitled ''The Legend of the Black Arrow''. Gumilev's book offered a more disciplined view of the Mongol leader which influenced Bodrov to create a film project about the warrior.<ref name="MongolMov"/>

Bodrov spent several years researching the aspects of his story, discovering that Khan was an orphan, a slave and a combatant who everyone tried to kill.<ref name="MongolMov"/> He found difficulty in preparing the screenplay for the film due to the fact that no contemporary Mongol biography existed. The only Mongol history from the era, was a short poem written by an unknown author entitled ''[[The Secret History of Mongols]]''. Author Gumilev had used the poem as a historical reference and a work of significant literature.<ref name="MongolMov"/> Casting for the film took place worldwide, including Mongolia; China; Russia; and in Los Angeles.<ref name="MongolMov"/> Speaking on the choice of Tadanobu Asano to portray Tem<U+00FC>jin, Bodrov commented that although it might have seemed odd to cast a Japanese actor in the role, he explained that the Mongol ruler was seen by many Japanese as one of their own. Bodrov said, "The Japanese had a very famous ancient warrior who disappeared, and they think he went to Mongolia and became Genghis Khan. He's a national hero, Genghis Khan. Mongolians can claim he's Mongolian, but the Japanese, they think they know who he is."<ref name="MongolMov"/> Bodrov felt casting actor Sun Honglei was a perfect mix of "gravity and humor" for the role. Describing the character interaction between Asano and Honglei, he noted "They're completely different people, Tem<U+00FC>jin and Jamukha, but they have a strong relationship, strong feelings between them." Aside from the Chinese and Japanese actors for those roles, the rest of the cast were Mongolian.<ref name="MongolMov"/>

===Filming===
[[File:MongolAsano.jpg|thumb|right|The character Tem<U+00FC>jin, dressed in Mongolian warrior garb]]
Production for ''Mongol'' began in 2005, lasting 25 weeks and taking place in China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Production designer Dashi Namdakov helped to recreate the pastoral lifestyle of the nomadic tribesmen.<ref name="MongolMov"/> Namdakov is originally from a Russian region which borders Mongolia and is home to many ethnic Mongols. Bodrov remarked, "Dashi has the Mongol culture in his bones and knows how to approach this material."<ref name="MongolMov"/> To help create some of the horse-mounted stunt sequences, Bodrov called upon seasoned stuntmen from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, whom he was familiar with during the production of ''[[Nomad (2005 film)|Nomad]]''.<ref name="MongolMov"/> Describing some of the stunt work, Bodrov claimed: "Not a single horse was hurt on this film. There's a line in the movie, when young Jamukha tells Tem<U+00FC>jin, 'For Mongol, horse is more important than woman.' And that's how it is with the Kazakh and Kyrgyz stunt people. They took very good care of the horses and were very conscientious." Bodrov collaborated on the film with editors [[Zach Staenberg]], who previously worked with ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and [[Vald<U+00ED>s <U+00D3>skarsd<U+00F3>ttir]], whose previous film work included ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''.<ref name="MongolMov"/>

Jonathan Kiefer, writing in the ''[[Sacramento News & Review]]'', said in outward praise, "At once sweeping and intimately confidential, with durably magnetic performances by Japan<U+2019>s Asano Tadanobu as the adored warlord and China<U+2019>s Honglei Sun as Jamukha, his blood brother and eventual enemy, ''Mongol'', a 2007 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee, has to be by far the best action epic of 12th- and 13th-century Asian nomads you<U+2019>ll see".
