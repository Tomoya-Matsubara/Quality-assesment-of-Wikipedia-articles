'''Johnson Creek''' is a 25-mile (40&nbsp;km) long tributary of the [[Willamette River]] in the [[Portland metropolitan area]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. Part of the [[drainage basin]] of the [[Columbia River]], its watershed consists of {{convert|54|sqmi|km2}} of mostly urban land occupied by about 175,000&nbsp;people as of 2006.<ref name=decade>

Though polluted, it is free-flowing along its main stem and provides habitat for [[salmon]] and other [[fish migration|migrating fish]].

Prior to European settlement, the watershed was heavily forested and was used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Chinookan|Chinook band]] for fishing and hunting. In the 19th&nbsp;century, white [[settler]]s cleared much of the land for farming, and the stream is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 built a water-powered [[sawmill]] along the creek. By the early 20th&nbsp;century, a rail line parallel to the stream encouraged further residential and commercial development. As urban density increased in the floodplain, seasonal floods grew more damaging. In the 1930s the [[Works Progress Administration]] of the [[United States government|federal government]] lined the lower {{convert|15|mi|km}} of Johnson Creek with rock to control the floods.<ref>

The Johnson Creek watershed includes the subwatersheds of Badger Creek, Sunshine Creek, Kelley Creek, Mitchell Creek, Veterans Creek, Crystal Springs Creek, and smaller streams. Parks along the creek and its tributaries include natural areas, a wildlife refuge, a [[rhododendron]] garden, a botanical garden, and a {{convert|21|mi|km|adj=on}} bicycle and pedestrian [[rail trail]] that follows the creek for much of its length.

==Course==
[[Image:FootbridgeJohnsonCreek.jpg|thumb|left|A footbridge crosses Johnson Creek near Regner Road in Gresham.]]Johnson Creek begins near the unincorporated community of [[Cottrell, Oregon|Cottrell]], in [[Clackamas County, Oregon]], southeast of [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]] in the foothills of the [[Cascade Range]], and flows generally westward about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} to its confluence with the [[Willamette River]], a major tributary of the [[Columbia River]].<ref name="Trout">{{cite web | last = Healthy Waters Institute | title = Johnson Creek Regional Information | publisher = Oregon Trout | url = http://www.healthywatersinstitute.org/pdf/Johnson%20Creek%20Regional%20Information.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2008-04-20 }}</ref> The creek passes through the cities of Gresham, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]] and crosses the border between Clackamas County and [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] eight times.<ref name="Trout">{{cite web | last = Healthy Waters Institute | title = Johnson Creek Regional Information | publisher = Oregon Trout | url = http://www.healthywatersinstitute.org/pdf/Johnson%20Creek%20Regional%20Information.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2008-03-16 }}</ref><ref name="streetmap"/><ref name="topomap"/> 

For much of its course, the creek flows at almost right angles to the numbered avenues of southeast Portland and its eastern suburbs. The biggest numbers are near the headwaters, and the smallest numbers are near the mouth. The creek begins in uplands in Clackamas County east of Southeast 362nd Avenue and flows swiftly to the west for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, crisscrossing the border between Clackamas County and Multnomah County 5&nbsp;times in this upstream stretch, and passing under [[U.S. Route 26 (Oregon)|U.S. Route 26]], the [[Mount Hood]] Highway, at about [[river mile]]&nbsp;20 (RM&nbsp;20) in Multnomah County. Shortly thereafter, it receives Badger Creek and Sunshine Creek from the left and the North Fork of Johnson Creek from the right.<ref name="streetmap"/><ref name="troutmap"/><ref name="topomap">{{cite map

Turning sharply, Johnson Creek flows swiftly northwest for about {{convert|3|mi|km}}, entering Gresham at about RM&nbsp;16.5 and passing the [[USGS]] gauge at Regner Road at RM&nbsp;16.2. 
At about RM&nbsp;16, the creek enters Main City Park in Gresham, where it again turns sharply and flows slightly south of west for most of the rest of its course. In Gresham the slope flattens and the stream runs more slowly for the next third of its course. Slightly west of Main City Park, it passes the [[Gresham Pioneer Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web |  title = Gresham Pioneer Cemetery | publisher = Metro | date=2008 | url = http://www.metro-region.org/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=12688 | accessdate = 2008-03-31 }}</ref> Just beyond the cemetery, it receives Butler Creek on the left, enters Portland at about RM&nbsp;13, and receives Kelley Creek on the left shortly thereafter. Mitchell Creek is a major tributary of Kelley Creek, which it enters about {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1}} south of Johnson Creek. Shortly thereafter, Johnson Creek passes the USGS gauge station at Sycamore at RM&nbsp;10.2.<ref name="streetmap"/><ref name="troutmap"/><ref name="topomap"/>

[[Meander]]ing slowly through the [[Lents, Portland, Oregon|Lents]] neighborhood of Portland, Johnson Creek receives Veterans Creek, which enters on the left from its headwaters in [[Happy Valley, Oregon|Happy Valley]] in Clackamas County. Johnson Creek passes under [[Interstate 205 (Oregon-Washington)|Interstate 205]], and shortly thereafter begins to flow more swiftly again from Southeast 82nd Avenue (RM 8) onwards. It then makes its sixth and seventh county-border crossings, dipping briefly into Clackamas County and back north into Multnomah County and then runs near the border between Portland and Milwaukie along Johnson Creek Boulevard for about {{convert|2|mi|km}}. After passing under [[Oregon Route 99E]], also known as Southeast McLoughlin Boulevard, in the [[Sellwood, Portland, Oregon|Sellwood]] neighborhood of Portland at about RM&nbsp;1.5, the creek turns sharply south.<ref name="streetmap">{{cite map |publisher = G.M.

At Southeast 21st&nbsp;Avenue, it receives Crystal Springs Creek, which enters on the right. This tributary, about {{convert|2|mi|km}} long, begins on the [[Reed College]] campus, flows under the [[Blue Bridge (Oregon)|Blue Bridge]] in Reed Canyon, through the [[Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden]], and generally south to Johnson Creek. From its confluence with Crystal Springs Creek, Johnson Creek flows south about {{convert|1|mi|km|1}}, crossing the county border for the eighth and final time. After re-entering Clackamas County, it passes the USGS gauge station at Milwaukie at RM&nbsp;0.7 and empties into the Willamette River at Willamette RM&nbsp;18.5 (km&nbsp;30). About {{convert|18.5|mi|km|-1}} below Johnson Creek, the Willamette River joins the Columbia River, which flows about another {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the Pacific Ocean at [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]].<ref name="streetmap">{{cite map |publisher = G.M.

==Watershed==
[[Image:Johnson creek SE 41st P2145.jpeg|thumb|Johnson Creek enters Tideman Johnson Park at Southeast 41st&nbsp;Avenue.]]
===Geology and topography===
The [[floodplain]] of Johnson Creek is a remnant of large glacial floods known as the [[Missoula Floods]] that deposited thick [[sediment]]s between 13,000 and 15,000&nbsp;years ago in the [[Columbia Basin|Columbia River Basin]], including much of the [[Willamette Valley]]. Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of [[basalt]] lavas from the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]]. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been folded and [[Fault (geology)|fault]]ed to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.<ref name="Trout"/>

The watershed is a roughly rectangular area of about {{convert|54|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name=decade/> The topography of the watershed varies greatly from the high point of about {{convert|1100|ft|m|0}} above sea level<ref name=decade/> in the Boring Hills near the creek's source to the low point of {{convert|26|ft|m|0}} where the creek meets the Willamette River. 

Slopes in the watershed range generally between 1 and 25&nbsp;percent. Mount Scott and [[Powell Butte]] rise to about {{convert|1000|ft|m|0}} and have slopes ranging from 10 to 30&nbsp;percent. Gresham Butte and Hogan Butte, in Gresham, have the steepest slopes, including a few around 50&nbsp;percent. The Boring Hills, of volcanic origin, rise more than {{convert|800|ft|m|0}} higher than the terraces to the north and west. The Kelso Slope, a northwest-sloping [[Dissected plateau|dissected surface]] west of the canyon of the [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]], tilts down from about {{convert|1000|ft|m|0}} above sea level near [[Sandy, Oregon|Sandy]] to about {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} above sea level east of Gresham.<ref name="actionplan"/>

Formed by the ancestral Columbia and Willamette Rivers, the [[Stream terrace|terraces]] north of Johnson Creek are generally underlain by permeable sand and gravel. Three isolated hills&mdash;[[Rocky Butte]], [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mount Tabor]], and Kelly Butte&mdash;rise about {{convert|200|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} above the surrounding terraces. With the exception of Powell Butte, the terrain on the north side of Johnson Creek is less steep than on the south side of the creek, which includes Mount Scott and the [[Boring Lava Field|Boring Lava Domes]].<ref name="actionplan">{{cite web | last = Johnson Creek Watershed Council | title = Action Plan: Chapter 2.0, Watershed Assessment | publisher = Johnson Creek Watershed Council |date=2003 | url = http://www.jcwc.org/actionPlan/ch2a.htm#2.2.0.0| | accessdate = 2008-03-17 }}</ref> 

The eastern half of the watershed is more open and rural than the urban western half, which consists largely of residential areas with pockets of commerce and industry. An estimated 175,000&nbsp;people lived in the watershed as of 2006.<ref name=decade/>

===Soils===
The potential for soil [[erosion]] varies throughout the watershed. Erosion is not a big threat in the northwestern part of the watershed, where the land is flat and developed, or in the northeast, dominated by low-erosion soils. In the southeast, soils have a medium risk of erosion, and soils around Powell Butte and the Boring Lava Domes have "an extremely high erodibility factor and are sensitive to ground disturbance".<ref name="actionplan"/>

The watershed's soils vary in their [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and water-retaining capacity. South of the creek and at the eastern end of the watershed they consist mostly of clays with high runoff potential. Northern areas of the watershed are generally porous, with moderate to high permeability.<ref name="actionplan"/>

===Hydrology===
[[Image:Johnson creek SE 41st weir P.jpg|thumb|right|Lower Johnson Creek rejoins itself after forming a small island near Southeast 42nd&nbsp;Avenue.]]
The watershed can be divided into two hydrologic areas with different [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] rates. The northern area, comprising about 40&nbsp;percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most of the rain that falls on the northern area percolates into the ground, and most of the rain that falls on the southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries. Rain that falls on the north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the [[Baseflow|base flow]] of the creek during dry periods.<ref name="Davis"/> 

Of the estimated 30&nbsp;creek systems that existed in the watershed before 19th-century settlement, fewer than a dozen remain above-ground or free-flowing.<ref name="decade"/> Generally, the tributaries begin south of the main stem and flow north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a [[groundwater]] discharge and flows south over relatively impermeable [[alluvial]] deposits to Johnson Creek at Johnson Creek Park.<ref name="Davis"/> The other major tributaries are Veterans Creek, Kelley Creek, Butler Creek, Sunshine Creek, and Badger Creek. Crystal Springs Creek and Kelley Creek are the largest tributaries in terms of flow contribution.<ref name="actionplan"/> 

[[Fill dirt|Fill]] at Foster Road and Southeast 111th Avenue usually prevents stormwater runoff from a {{convert|9|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area of the watershed in the [[Lents, Portland, Oregon|Lents]] and [[Powellhurst-Gilbert, Portland, Oregon|Powellhurst-Gilbert]] neighborhoods from flowing directly into the creek. Instead, runoff is routed to [[sump]]s, where it percolates into the ground. Normal drainage patterns have also been altered further downstream in the [[Sellwood, Portland, Oregon|Sellwood]], [[Eastmoreland, Portland, Oregon|Eastmoreland]], [[Westmoreland, Portland, Oregon|Westmoreland]], and [[Woodstock, Portland, Oregon|Woodstock]] neighborhoods, where runoff flows into the Portland sewer system instead of into the creek.<ref name="Davis"/>

===Jurisdiction===
Six local political jurisdictions overlap with the Johnson Creek watershed. In 2000, 38&nbsp;percent of the watershed was in Portland's city limits, 24&nbsp;percent in unincorporated Clackamas County, 23&nbsp;percent in Gresham, 11&nbsp;percent in unincorporated Multnomah County, 4&nbsp;percent in Milwaukie, and 0.1&nbsp;percent in [[Happy Valley, Oregon|Happy Valley]]. None of the cities lies entirely within the watershed. In 2000, Johnson Creek and its tributaries drained 53&nbsp;percent of Gresham, 42&nbsp;percent of Milwaukie, 19&nbsp;percent of Happy Valley, and 14&nbsp;percent of Portland. The watershed covered only 1.2&nbsp;percent of unincorporated Multnomah County and less than 1&nbsp;percent of unincorporated Clackamas County.<ref name="actionplan"/> 

Neighboring watersheds on the east side of the Willamette River include Mount Scott Creek and Kellogg Creek, which flow through Milwaukie and drain directly into the Willamette; the Clackamas River, which drains the southeast suburbs and empties into the Willamette near [[Oregon City]]; the [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]], which drains the eastern suburbs and empties into the Columbia; and Fairview Creek and the Columbia Slough, which drain north Portland and Gresham, emptying into the Columbia. 

Watersheds on the west side of the Willamette within Portland's jurisdiction include [[Fanno Creek]], which drains [[Hillsdale, Oregon|Hillsdale]] and Portland's southwest suburbs, emptying into the [[Tualatin River]]; [[Tryon Creek]], which empties into the Willamette near [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Lake Oswego]]; and numerous small streams in the [[Forest Park]] area, such as [[Balch Creek]], that flow through Portland and drain directly into the Willamette.

Historically, other small watersheds and subwatersheds existed in the Portland basin. On the city's west side, two named streams, Tanner Creek and Johnson Creek, appear on early settlement maps, but they have since been diverted into underground pipes. The buried Johnson Creek on the west side has no relationship to the Johnson Creek on the east side.<ref>{{cite web

Nineteenth-century maps also show numerous springs and small streams flowing into a wetland that covered an area of today's southeast Portland between Powell Boulevard ([[U.S. Route 26]]) and Johnson Creek, a distance of {{convert|2.25|mi|km|1}}. Though most of the wetland complex has been filled in and built upon, remnants exist at the [[Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden]] on Crystal Springs Creek. Old maps also show two streams flowing into a slough that drained part of the wetland. One flowed through the Clinton Street neighborhood, about six city blocks north of Powell Boulevard, and the other drained the Colonial Heights neighborhood, slightly further north near [[Ladd's Addition, Portland, Oregon|Ladd's Addition]]. These streams and most others in this area were diverted into the city sewer system and no longer appear on the surface.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Chinook.png|left|thumb|Traditional Chinook tribal territory is shown in dark green in the lower Columbia River basin, including Johnson Creek. The Clackamas tribe of the Chinooks fished and hunted along the creek until the mid-19th century.]] Before settlers moved into the basin, it consisted mainly of upland and [[wetland]] forests in which [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] fished, hunted, and foraged. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] as early as 10,000&nbsp;years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000&nbsp;years ago, settlements in the [[Clackamas River]] basin, adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed, had moved to the river's lower floodplain. The area was the home of the [[Clackamas (tribe)|Clackamas Indians]], [[Chinookan languages|Chinookan]] speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from [[Celilo Falls]] to the Pacific Ocean. Their lands included the lower Willamette River from [[Willamette Falls]] at what became [[Oregon City, Oregon]], to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades. When [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800&nbsp;people living in 11&nbsp;villages. Epidemics of [[smallpox]], [[malaria]], and [[measles]] reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite web

By the middle of the 19th century, the [[European American]] newcomers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill.<ref name="parks">{{cite web | title = Johnson Creek Park | publisher = Portland Parks and Recreation |date = 2008 | url = http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?PropertyID=205&action=ViewPark | accessdate = 2008-03-14}}</ref> In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]], filed a [[Donation Land Claim Act|donation land claim]] and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River.<ref>{{cite web

By removing the original vegetation, rural and urban development of the Johnson Creek watershed induced more rapid storm runoff and expensive floods. As a flood-control measure in the 1930s, the [[Works Progress Administration]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] cleared and lined with rock about 90&nbsp;percent of the creek between its mouth and Southeast 158th&nbsp;Avenue, (near RM&nbsp;15), creating an artificial channel {{convert|6|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep and {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} wide.<ref name="Davis"/> Although substantially altering the stream and its aquatic life, this channel failed to prevent overflows, the largest of which damaged 1,200&nbsp;structures in 1964.<ref name=bureau2/>
