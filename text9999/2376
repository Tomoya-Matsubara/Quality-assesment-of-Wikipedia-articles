'''Johann Jakob Brucker''' (22 January 1696 <U+2013> 26 November 1770) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian of philosophy]].

==Life==

He was born at [[Augsburg]]. He was destined for the [[Lutheran]] Church, and graduated at the [[University of Jena]] in 1718. He returned to Augsburg in 1720, but became parish minister of [[Kaufbeuren]] in 1723.
 
In 1731 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and was invited to return again to Augsburg as pastor and senior minister of the Church of St. Ulrich. 

He died at Augsburg.

==Works==

His chief work, ''Historia Critica Philosophiae'' (<U+201C>Critical History of Philosophy<U+201D>), appeared at [[Leipzig]] (1742-1744). Its success was such that a new edition was published in six volumes (1766-1767; English translation by W. Enfield, 1791). It is by this work alone that Brucker is now known. It was the first complete history of the different philosophical schools. It embodies an ample collection of materials, and contains valuable biographies. 

He also wrote ''Tentamen Introductionis in Historiam Doctrinae de Ideis'', afterwards completed and republished under the title of ''Historia Phiosophicae Doctrinae de Ideis'' (Augsburg, 1723); ''Otium Viedelicum'' (1731); ''Kurze Fragen aus dem philosophischen Historiae'' (l vols., Ulm, 1731-1736), a [[history of philosophy]] in question and answer, containing many details, especially in the department of [[History of literature|literary history]], which he omitted in his chief work; ''Pinacotheca Scriptorum nostra actate literis illustrium'', &c. (Augsburg, 1741-1755); ''Ehrentempel der deutschen Geletzrsamkeil'' (Augsburg, 1747-1749); ''Institutiones Historiae Philosophicae ''(Leipzig, 1747 and 1756; 3rd ed. with a continuation by F. G. B. Born (1743-1807) of Leipzig, in 1790); ''Miscellanea Historiae Philosophicae Literariae Criticae ohm sparsim edita'' (Augsburg, 1748); ''Erste Anfangsgrunde der philosophischen Geschichte'' (Ulm, 1751). He superintended an edition of [[Martin Luther]]'s translation of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]], with a commentary extracted from the writings of the English theologians (Leipzig, 1758-1770, completed by V. A. Teller).
