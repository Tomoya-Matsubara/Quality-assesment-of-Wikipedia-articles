}}'''Richard Gale "Dick" Rifenburg''' (August 21, 1926 in [[Petoskey, Michigan]] &ndash; December 5, 1994 in [[Cheektowaga, New York]]) was a pioneering television broadcaster for the forerunner to [[WIVB-TV]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He was also a professional [[American football]] [[wide receiver]] who played in the [[National Football League|NFL]] for the [[Detroit Lions]] in [[1950 NFL season|1950]] and had been an [[All-American]] [[End (American football)|end]] for the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] in [[1944 college football season|1944]] and [[1946 college football season|1946]]&ndash;[[1948 college football season|1948]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=RIFENDIC01|title=Dick Rifenburg |publisher=databaseSports.com|work=databaseFootball.com |accessdate=2007-11-27}}</ref>  After retiring from football he settled in Buffalo and became a sports [[Presenter|broadcaster]]. He worked as a sidelines reporter for the [[Buffalo Bills]] and as a [[play-by-play announcer]] for the [[Buffalo Bulls]]. He hosted various [[television]] and [[radio]] sports shows and was eventually inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame.

In college, he led the [[Big Ten Conference]] in single season [[reception (American football)|receptions]] during his senior year and set Michigan Wolverines receptions records for both career [[touchdown]] and single-season touchdowns. He had also been a [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] (MHSAA) state champion in both [[basketball]] and [[track & field]]. His college career was interrupted by [[World War II]] service, and his high school career was also affected by the war due to the MHSAA's cancellation of state championships in all sports in 1943.

==High school==
Rifenburg was raised in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] before his family moved to [[Saginaw, Michigan]]. Rifenburg was a star athlete at Saginaw's [[Arthur Hill High School]] in football, basketball, and track and field. In 1943, Michigan canceled boys high school tournaments in all sports due to World War II, and they did not return until the fall of 1944. In 1944, he led Arthur Hill High to the MHSAA Class A high school basketball championship (over [[Kalamazoo Central High School]]), scoring 24 [[Point (basketball)|points]], including 17 in the second half, of the championship game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhsaa.com/resources/library/bbbflash04.pdf|title=Finals Flashback|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=Michigan High School Athletic Association}}</ref> Rifenburg was also the state champion in 1944 in both the [[shot put]] {{height|ft=46|in=11|abbr=mos|wiki=yes}} and [[high jump]] {{height|ft=5|in=8.5|abbr=mos}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhsaa.com/sports/btr/yearlyindv1940.html|title=Boys Track and Field Individual Champions &ndash; 1940-1949|publisher=Michigan High School Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-11-27|author=Moyes, Jim and Bill Khan}}</ref>  He also led Arthur Hill in football,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/peschstats/glory.htm|title=Glory|accessdate=2007-11-27}}</ref> and his high school accomplishments are featured in ''Glory: The history of Saginaw County sports'' by Jack Tany (ASIN B0006RH9Z6), which is a book on high school sports in [[Saginaw County, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Glory-history-Saginaw-County-sports/dp/B0006RH9Z6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196177772&sr=8-1|title=Glory: The history of Saginaw County sports |publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|accessdate=2007-11-27|year=2007}}</ref>  Rifenburg was named All State in football, basketball and track.<ref name=BN/>  

It is ironic that Rifenburg was born in Petoskey, Michigan in 1926 for several reasons.  [[Ted Petoskey]] preceded Rifenburg as an All-American end on the University of Michigan football team. Petoskey had excelled as a representative of Saginaw County in MHSAA competition. Petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well. Achieving All-American status as an end at Michigan would be Rifenburg's next step after excelling in MHSAA competition.

==College==
In the fall of 1944, Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan. The [[United Press]] syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows: "Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick Rifenburg, 18-year-old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating. A loose-limbed 180-pound freshman from Saginaw, Mich., Rifenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten's next 'freshman sensation.'"<ref>{{cite news|author=Byers, Walt|title=''Michigan's Rifenburg Likened to Oosterbaan''|publisher=[[United Press]]|date=1944-09-27|accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref>  As a [[freshman]], he caught two touchdown passes in his first [[college football]] game against Iowa. In an article titled "Teens and TNT," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported on Rifenburg's performance: "Of the few teams already in action, Michigan's teens rang the freshman bell loudest last week by winning their opener, 12 -to-7, against the strong [[Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks football|Iowa Seahawks (Naval Pre-Flight)]]; 6-ft. 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns."<ref>{{cite news|author=Northrop, Milt|title=''Teens and TNT''|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,791689,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|date=1944-09-25|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>

[[File:2008-1226-Pasadena-008-RoseBowl.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Rifenburg caught a [[touchdown]] in the [[1948 Rose Bowl]].]]
Rifenburg's college career was interrupted by World War II service in the [[United States Navy]],<ref name=BN/> but after missing the 1945 season, he returned to play for the Wolverines from 1946&ndash;1948. Rifenburg played for the Wolverines in consecutive undefeated [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|National Championship]] seasons in 1947 and 1948.<ref name=Bentley1947/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1948fbt.htm|title=1948 Football Team|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=2007-11-27|date=2007-03-31}}</ref>  He started nine games for the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 team]].<ref name=Bentley1947>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1947fbt.htm|title=1947 Football Team|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=2007-11-27|date=2007-03-31}}</ref>  The 1947 team referred to as "Michigan's Mad Magicians" is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time.<ref name=ESPNB10>{{cite book |last = Jones  |first = Todd |editor= MacCambridge, Michael  |title = ESPN Big Ten College Football Encyclopedia |chapter=Michigan |publisher = ESPN Enterprises  |year = 2007|isbn = 1933060492}}</ref>  Rifenberg and teammate [[Len Ford]] had the reputation as the team practical jokers. During the 1947 game against [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]], Rifenburg started calling signals for the Badgers. Wisconsin's offense protested to officials, who "prowled the Wolverines secondary but never caught their man."   Rifenburg continued to scramble Badger signals, as Rifenburg's teammates laughed at his scheme.<ref>{{cite news|author=O'Neill, Michael J.|title=''Michigan's Wisecrackers May Pounce on Trojans''|publisher=[[Fresno Bee]]|date=1944-12-14|accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref>    In the January 1, 1948 [[1948 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] that season, Michigan rolled to a 49&ndash;0 victory over USC,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tournamentofroses.com/history/gamescores.asp|title=Pasadena Tournament of Roses: Past Game Scores|accessdate=2007-11-26|year=2007|publisher=Tournament of Roses}}</ref> and they outgained the Trojans 491 yards to 133. Rifenburg caught a 29-yard pass for the game's final score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/bowls/1948rose.htm|title=Michigan's Bowl Game History: 1948 Rose Bowl|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|date=2007-03-28}}</ref> 

In the [[1948 Michigan Wolverines football team|1948 championship season]], Rifenburg scored eight touchdowns, caught 22 passes, and gained 610 yards (508 receiving and 102 rushing).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fballam/aarifenb.htm|title=University of Michigan Football All-American: Richard Rifenburg|accessdate=2007-12-12|date=2007-02-07|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan}}</ref> Rifenburg was the second highest scoring end in the nation in 1948, and he was a consensus All-American as a senior, being selected as first team on nine of the 11 All-American teams.<ref name=DSAISH>{{cite news|author=Northrop, Milt|title=''Delectable Subplots Await in Season's Homestretch''|publisher=[[Buffalo News]]|date=1994-12-07|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref> Rifenburg led the Big Ten in receptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/big10/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2007bigtenfbguide.pdf|accessdate=2007-12-05|title=Big Ten Football: Annual Statistical Champions - Individual|publisher=The Big Ten Conference}}</ref>  

Although Rifenburg finished fourth among midwestern Heisman voters in 1948, he did not finish among the top eight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heisman.com/winners/d-walker48.html|title=1948 - 14th Award: Doak Walker, Southern Methodist Back|accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=heisman.com}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  By comparison, Notre Dame [[End (football)|end]] [[Leon Hart]] won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 All-American teams.<ref name=DSAISH/>  It is not clear why Rifenburg did not finish higher. However, it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against Michigan. In the [[Associated Press]] poll at the end of the 1947 season, the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan, though both teams were undefeated. Some noted that every Southern AP voter had voted for Notre Dame, which had yet to integrate, whereas three of Michigan's star players ([[Bob Mann (American football)|Bob Mann]], [[Gene Derricotte]], and [[Len Ford]]) were African-American. The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African-American players.<ref>John Kryk, "Natural Enemies: Major College Football's Oldest, Fiercest Rivalry," Taylor Trade Publishing, 2004, ISBN 1589790901, p. 145.</ref>

Rifenburg was considered one of the greatest Wolverine's of the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordpress.com/sports/content/oh/story/sports/college/osu/2007/01/07/ddn010707decades.html|title=Our choices as the best college football programs in the previous six decades|accessdate=2007-11-27|date=2007-01-07|publisher=Oxford Press}}</ref>  In four seasons with the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]], Rifenburg played in 32 games and had over 1,000 yards of total offense. Rifenburg held the University of Michigan's single season and career record for touchdown receptions (eight in a season; sixteen career) until his records were broken by [[Anthony Carter (American football)|Anthony Carter]] in 1980.<ref name=DSAISH/>

==Professional career==
In 1948, Rifenburg was drafted by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the 15th round of the NFL draft,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?lg=nfl&yr=1948|title=1948 NFL Player Draft|publisher=databaseSports.com|work=databaseFootball.com |accessdate=2007-11-27|date=}}</ref> and he was also drafted by the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]].<ref name=WATNDRF>{{cite news|author=Patton, Paul|title=''Where Are They Now? Dick Rifenburg Football''|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=1985-06-19|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>  He had intended to play in 1949 with the Yankees, but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 college All-Star game.<ref name=Lions/>  Press accounts at the time noted that the injury "will probably keep him out of pro football all season, if not forever."<ref name=Injury>{{cite news|author=Harmon, Pat|title=''Short-Sighted Pros''|publisher=[[Cedar Rapids Gazette]]|date=1949-08-10|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>   The incident led to a debate as to whether NFL owners should "bar their men from playing with the college all-stars."<ref name=Injury/>

Rifenburg landed a job at [[WJR]] radio in Detroit,<ref name=WATNDRF/> but he left his sportscaster's job to join the [[Detroit Lions]].<ref name=Lions>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitlions.com/document_display.cfm?cont_id=75847|title=A Look Back: Decade of Dominance|author=Paladino, Larry|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=Detroit Lions}}</ref> In the [[1950 NFL season]], Rifenburg came back from his injury to play for the [[Detroit Lions]]. He played in 12 games and had ten receptions for 96 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=RIFENDIC01|title=Dick Rifenburg|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=databaseSports.com|work=databaseFootball.com}}</ref>  Rifenburg recalled that his playing time with the Lions was limited because the Lions also signed 1949 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Leon Hart]], who played the same position.<ref name=WATNDRF/>

In May 1951, he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=''Rifenburg Quits Lions''|publisher=Daily Globe (Ironwood, Michigan)|date=1951-05-17|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>   He was hired as a sportscaster by [[WIVB-TV|WBEN]] (now known as WIVB), which had just started the first television station in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and the only one serving Southern Ontario. This was an early foray into television by the [[Buffalo Evening News]]. In the 1950s, Rifenburg hosted a popular panel show called "Let's Talk Sports" in Buffalo and also pioneered an early morning [[Physical exercise|exercise]] program.<ref name=WATNDRF/>  He also worked for [[WBEN (AM)]] and [[WBEN (FM)]] and as the sideline announcer for [[Buffalo Bills]] games along with [[Van Miller]], the long time Bills [[play-by-play announcer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalobroadcasters.com/hist_wivb.asp|title=The Buffalo Broadcasters History of WBEN-TV (WIBV Channel 4)|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=The Buffalo Broadcasters|author=Baker, Vic}}</ref>  In addition, he served as the play-by-play announcer for the [[Buffalo Bulls football|University of Buffalo Bulls football]] team.<ref name=BN/>  As a radio broadcaster, he is remembered for things ranging from ski reports, to 17 years worth of "Breakfast At <U+2014>" programs live from various local restaurants, to 27 years as the WBEN-AM All Night Show host.<ref name=BB/>

After 30 years with WBEN and a change in ownership for the station, his show was replaced with the [[Mutual Network]]'s [[Larry King Show]].<ref name=BN/>  In the 1980s, Rifenburg taught communications at Buffalo's [[Medaille College]] and served as a disc jockey on Public Broadcasting's radio station WEBR (now [[WNED (AM)]]).<ref name=WATNDRF/>  He also sold ads for Buffalo Evening News competitor, [[Buffalo Courier-Express]].<ref name=BN/>  Rifenburg's final employer was [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], who hired him as an [[Incarceration|inmate]] training supervisor at the Erie County Correctional Facility.<ref name=BN/>  

Rifenburg was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame in September 2007.<ref name=HEALBAH>{{cite news|author=Anderson, Dale|title=''Humor emotion as local broadcasters are honored''|publisher=[[Buffalo News]]|date=1987-09-26|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>  He was given the Golden Age Award which is reserved for "those who did it first, the people who had no pattern to follow."<ref name=BB>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalobroadcasters.com/|title=Buffalo Broadcasters|accessdate=2007-12-12|publisher=The Buffalo Broadcasters|year=2006}}</ref> The Hall of Fame award was presented to Rifenburg's wife, Jane. In her acceptance speech, Jane Rifenburg observed that despite all of her late husband's achievements, there was one thing he had never received: "He had a great career, but he never had a trophy. And now he has."<ref name=HEALBAH/>
