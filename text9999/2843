==Citical response==
The film was not panned, but did not meet expectations. ''[[The Times of India]]'' wrote that the film "has a promising premise, but ends up being just half of what it aspires to be."<ref name="Times of India 2">{{cite news|last1=TNN staff|title=Oru Second Class Yathra Movie Review|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movie-reviews/Oru-Second-Class-Yathra/movie-review/47220563.cms|accessdate=May 21, 2015|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=May 10, 2014}}</ref>

''[[Now Running]]'' wrote that while not a damaging film, it was not offensive.  With most of the film's scenes shot inside a train, the film is "more of a road movie in the sense that the action which starts at the northern tip of Kerala culminates at the southern end, with the rest of the passengers turning out to be characters who intend to make some impact on the narrative."<ref name="Now Running">{{cite news|last1=Veeyen|title=Oru Second Class Yathra Review|url=http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/16672/malayalam/oru-second-class-yathra/5068/review/|accessdate=May 21, 2015|publisher=[[Now Running]]|date=May 10, 2015}}</ref> 

''[[International Business Times]]'' wrote that despite the positive buzz created before release, the film "fails to come out as a comedy suspense thriller as it was supposed to be".<ref name="International Business Times 1"/>  The director duo of Jexon Antony and Rejis Antony adopted a flash-back narrative, but "unfortunately the suspense elements went amiss, especially in the second half."<ref name="International Business Times 1"/>  The first portion of the film offered promises which failed during its second half.<ref name="International Business Times 1">{{cite news|last1=V.P.|first1=Nicy|title='Oru Second Class Yathra' Movie Review: Vineeth Sreenivasan-Nikki Galrani Starrer Fails as Suspense Thriller|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/oru-second-class-yathra-movie-review-live-updates-vineeth-sreenivasan-nikki-galrani-starrer-631707|accessdate=May 21, 2015|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=May 8, 2015}}</ref> 

''Indiaglitz'' felt it was presented in a sedate pace contrary to expectations for a thriller film. the first half of the film was as hoped for, but disappointed in its flagging in its second half. It was felt that directors Jexson and Rejis Anthony did "okay on their first outing and a more polished movie is expected from them in future."<ref name="Indiglitz 1"/>  The projects cinematography by Vinod Illampally was praised, but as is quite good. Since thrillers require a greater punching up during post-production, "the editing seems a bit lax."<ref name="Indiglitz 1"/>  The background score was fine, but in considering [[Gopi Sunder]]<U+2019>s body of work, it could have been better.  They summarized, writing the film "has a novel theme, yet the execution could have been better. A bit more taut and crisp, with its first half- like narration in the second half too could have taken the movie far ahead. It is not a bad attempt and is very much a family movie and the subject of rape of a different nature is very relevant. Watch it without much expectation and you might be pleasantly surprised.<ref name="Indiglitz 1">{{cite news|last1=staff|title=Oru Second Class Yathra Review|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/oru-second-class-yathra-malayalam-movie-review-19678.html|accessdate=May 21, 2015|publisher=IndiaGlitz|date=May 11, 2015}}</ref>
