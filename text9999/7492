'''US Highway 16''' ('''US&nbsp;16'''), also called '''Grand River Avenue''' for much of its length, is one of the principal pre-[[Interstate Highway|Interstate]] roads in the state of [[Michigan]]. Before the creation of the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] in 1926, the highway had been designated '''M-16'''. The modern road cuts across the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] in a northwest<U+2013>southeast fashion from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] to [[Detroit]]. Before the late 1950s and early 1960s, US&nbsp;16 followed other roads between [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]] and Grand Rapids, and then Grand River Avenue through [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] to Detroit. With the coming of the [[Interstate Highway System]], US&nbsp;16 was shifted from the older roads to the new freeways. When the gap in the freeway was filled in around Lansing, the US&nbsp;16 [[decommissioned highway|designation was decommissioned]] in the state. The freeway was then designated only [[Interstate 96]] (I-96) or [[Interstate 196|I-196]].

The original pathway along the Grand River Avenue corridor was an [[Native American|Indian]] trail. This trail was used by the first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan in 1701. Later this trail was expanded into a [[plank road]] that formed the basis for one of the first [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highways]] as M-16. Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of [[M-43 (Michigan highway)|M-43]] or [[Business routes of Interstate 96|business loops off I-96]]. The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in downtown Detroit is an unsigned state trunkline, sometimes referred to as [[Interstate 96 Business (Detroit, Michigan)|Old Business Spur I-96]] (OLD BS I-96). In Detroit, Grand River is one of five major avenues (along with [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward]], [[Michigan Avenue (Michigan)|Michigan]], [[Gratiot Avenue|Gratiot]], and [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson]])  planned by Judge [[Augustus Woodward]] in 1805 that extend from downtown Detroit in differing directions. Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city's downtown.

== Route description ==
At the time of its decommissioning, US&nbsp;16 started its run through Michigan at the carferry docks in Muskegon. The ferry extended across [[Lake Michigan]], connecting Muskegon to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], where US&nbsp;16 continued to the west. From the docks, US&nbsp;16 and [[M-46 (Michigan highway)|M-46]] [[concurrency (road)|traveled concurrently]] south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US&nbsp;16 turned south along [[U.S. Route 31 Business (Muskegon, Michigan)|Business US&nbsp;31]] (BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through [[Muskegon Heights, Michigan|Muskegon Heights]] to [[Norton Shores, Michigan|Norton Shores]]. Here, the business loop ended at [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]], and US&nbsp;16 joined the [[Interstate 196|I-196]] freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US&nbsp;16's decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US&nbsp;16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural [[Muskegon County, Michigan|Muskegon County]] parallel to the former US&nbsp;16 routing through [[Fruitport, Michigan|Fruitport]] to [[Nunica, Michigan|Nunica]] in [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]]. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of [[M-104 (Michigan highway)|M-104]], and continued east through more mixed forest and grassland terrain to serve the communities of [[Coopersville, Michigan|Coopersville]] and [[Marne, Michigan|Marne]].<ref name="MSHD62">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year= 1962 |section=K8<U+2013>M14}}</ref>

As the freeway approached [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]], it met the western terminus of [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|M-11]] which was the former routing of US&nbsp;16 through the [[Grand Rapids metropolitan area]]. I-196/US&nbsp;16 continued eastward around the north side of the metro area through the suburbs of [[Walker, Michigan|Walker]] and [[Comstock Park, Michigan|Comstock Park]]. The freeway intersected the contemporaneous routing of [[U.S. Route 131|US&nbsp;131]] along the East Beltline and curved south through the eastern edge of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] to meet the then-current end of I-96 east of downtown. There I-196 ended and US&nbsp;16 was transferred to the I-96 freeway. I-96/US&nbsp;16 continued southward intersecting Cascade Road, which was previously US&nbsp;16. Cascade Road east of this interchange meets the westernmost part of Grand River Avenue, which carried US&nbsp;16 east all the way to Downtown Detroit.<ref name=MSHD62/> Grand River Avenue ends at Cascade Road, but the historic routing carried it through [[Ada, Michigan|Ada]] and [[Plainfield Township, Kent County, Michigan|Plainfield Township]] along the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]]. The western end is at East Beltline, short of its westernmost extent in Grand Rapids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflansingmi.com/pnd/historypres/historydetails.jsp |title=Lansing History |publisher=City of Lansing |accessdate=March 21, 2008}}</ref> 

[[Image:Grand River Avenue.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Grand River Avenue sign in East Lansing]]
[[M-50 (Michigan highway)|M-50]] also joined the freeway at Cascade Road headed east, and together I-96/US&nbsp;16/M-50 continued through eastern Kent County. M-50 departed to the south near [[Lowell, Michigan|Lowell]], and the freeway crossed into southern [[Ionia County, Michigan|Ionia County]]. Passing south of [[Portland, Michigan|Portland]], the freeway crossed east into [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]]. North of [[Grand Ledge, Michigan|Grand Ledge]], I-96 ended and US&nbsp;16 followed Wright Road off the freeway to Grand River Avenue. From here east, US&nbsp;16 resumed its historic routing into the city of Lansing. Grand River Avenue carried the highway passed the airport and east to Larch Street, where US&nbsp;16 turned south along [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]] north of downtown Lansing. At Saginaw Street, eastbound US&nbsp;16 turned east on the [[one-way traffic|one-way street]], while westbound traffic ran a block north on Grand River Avenue. The two directions of travel merge at the east end of Saginaw Street in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]]. Grand River Avenue through East Lansing follows a tree-lined boulevard that forms the division between the campus of [[Michigan State University]] to the south and the rest of the city to the north. US&nbsp;16 continues east through [[Ingham County, Michigan|Ingham County]] through [[Okemos, Michigan|Okemos]] and rural parts of the county through [[Williamston, Michigan|Williamston]] and [[Webberville, Michigan|Webberville]].<ref name=MSHD62/>

[[File:M-43 Grand River Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Modern M-43 running along Grand River Avenue at Colllingwood Drive in East Lansing]]
Grand River Avenue crosses to the east into [[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]] through [[Fowlerville, Michigan|Fowlerville]] to [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]]. In Howell, Grand River Avenune meets Hartland Road which carries [[M-59 (Michigan highway)|M-59]]; the highway also met [[M-155 (Michigan highway)|M-155]] in downtown, which at the time provided access to the Howell State Hospital. In the approach to [[Brighton, Michigan|Brighton]], Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the then-built section of the I-96 freeway. US&nbsp;16 merged onto the freeway, and I-96/US&nbsp;16 met the northern end of then-built [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]] freeway. I-96/US&nbsp;16 continued east into [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]] through [[Wixom, Michigan|Wixom]] and [[Novi, Michigan|Novi]].<ref name=MSHD62/>

Near [[Farmington, Michigan|Farmington]], I-96 left what is now its current routing and continued to the southeast of the present-day I-96/[[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]]/[[Interstate 696|I-696]]/[[M-5 (Michigan highway)|M-5]] interchange along the current M-5. Grand River Avenue through here was [[Interstate 96 Business (Farmington, Michigan)|Business Loop I-96]] (BL&nbsp;I-96). The freeway ends at a junction with Grand River Avenue that also marked the end of the business loop. From there, US&nbsp;16 continued along Grand River Avenue all the way into downtown Detroit. Along the way, it intersected [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]] at Telegraph Road and [[M-39 (Michigan highway)|M-39]] at Southfield Road. [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&nbsp;12]] joined US&nbsp;16 along Grand River Avenue at Plymouth Road. The two ran the rest of the way concurrently to [[Cadillac Square]]. There they terminated at a common point with [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]] (Woodward Avenue) and [[U.S. Route 112|US&nbsp;112]] (Michigan Avenue). [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|US&nbsp;25]] ran through the square on [[M-85 (Michigan highway)|Fort Street ]] and [[M-3 (Michigan highway)|Gratiot Avenue]].<ref name=MSHD62/>

== History ==
The history of Grand River Avenue, and US&nbsp;16 in Michigan dates back to before the earliest settlement of Michigan by Europeans. The route has been the basis for an Indian trail, a [[Michigan Highway System|state highway]], a part of the [[US Highway System]], and a section of the [[Interstate Highway System]].

===Indian trail to state highway===
The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian Trails that crossed the future state of Michigan. The Grand River Trail was one of these thirteen trails at the time.  Detroit created {{convert|120|ft|m|0|adj=on}} rights-of-way for the principle streets of the city, Grand River Avenue included in 1805.<ref name=lingeman-1>[[#Lingeman|Lingeman]], p. 1.</ref> This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit.<ref name=baulch1999-06-13>{{cite news |url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=205 |first=Vivian M. |last= Baulch |work=Detroit News |date=June 13, 1999 |title= Woodward Avenue, Detroit's Grand Old 'Main Street' |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref> A ten-year project to construct a [[plank road]] between Detroit and Howell was authorized in 1820 along the Grand River Trail.<ref name=lingeman-1/> Grand River Avenue was included as one of Five Great Military Roads in 1825, along with the River Road, Michigan Avenue, Woodward Avenue and and Gratiot Avenue.<ref name=WCRC>{{cite web |title=History: The River Road |publisher=Wayne County Department of Public   Services |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071219144832/http://www.waynecounty.com/dps_roads/history/written_history2.htm |url=http://www.waynecounty.com/dps_roads/history/written_history2.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The Grand River Road, precursor to the modern Grand River Avenue was named by Benjamin Williams, cofounder of [[Owosso, Michigan|Owosso]]; it was named for ''La Grande Riviere'', the French name for the river.<ref name=woodard-12>[[#Woodard|Woodard]], p. 12.</ref>

The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in New York in 1826 brought new settlers to the Great Lakes region, and to the future state of Michigan. Many of these settlers began their inland journeys in Detroit. At first the Grand River Road was a "deep rutted, ditch bordered road".<ref name=woodard-6>[[#Woodard|Woodard]], p. 6.</ref> The road branched into two at Rouge (now [[Redford, Michigan|Redford]]). The southern branch roughly followed the modern route of Grand River Avenue. The northern route ran by way of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] along Woodward Avenue and the modern [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]] to the north of the Lansing area.<ref name=woodard8-10>[[#Woodard|Woodard]], pp. 8<U+2013>10.</ref> From [[Bancroft, Michigan|Bancroft]], several trails branched off, including the northern branch of the Grand River Road and the [[Saginaw Trail]].<ref name=woodard10-11>[[#Woodard|Woodard]], pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref> The two branches merged back together near [[Dewitt, Michigan|Dewitt]] and continued west toward [[Ionia, Michigan|Ionia]] and on to Grand Rapids and Newton (now [[Grand Haven, Michigan|Grand Haven]]).<ref name=woodard11-12>[[#Woodard|Woodard]], pp. 11<U+2013>12.</ref> The early travelers plied the road in wagons pulled by oxen or horses and drivers charged between four and seven cents a mile.

The [[United States Congress]] further aided the road in 1835 with an appropriation of $25,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1835|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) for a {{convert|20|ft|m|0|adj=on}} road on {{convert|100|ft|m|0}} of right-of-way.<ref name=lingeman-2>[[#Lingeman|Lingeman]], p. 2.</ref> These improvements included removing brush and debris and the construction of bridges across the the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|Rouge]], [[Shiawassee River|Shiawassee]], [[Red Cedar River (Michigan)|Red Cedar]] and Grand rivers.<ref name=woodard28>[[#Woodard|Woodard]], p. 28.</ref> The Grand River Road was a major route for settlers headed inland to Grand Rapids in 1836, as the shortest route for travelers coming from Detroit.<ref name=fisher-78>[[#Fisher|Fisher]], p. 78.</ref> An [[Panic of 1837|economic panic in 1837]] drove settlers from New York to Michigan. These settlers followed the Grand River Road, and new settlements were created along the route, every {{convert|6|mi|km}} or so; that distance being a good day's travel by horse. Approximately 124 wagons left Detroit each day between August and November 1843. When the state capitol was moved to Lansing, an improved road was needed to the capital city.<ref name=woodard24-28>[[#Woodard|Woodard]], pp. 24<U+2013>29.</ref>

In 1850, the [[Michigan State Legislature]] established the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company,<ref name=Act132of1850>{{cite web |author=[[Michigan Legislature]] |url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-54463_18670_18793-52865--,00.html |title= An Act to Incorporate the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] |date= March 20, 1850 |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> which set about converting various Indian trails into the Lansing<U+2013>Howell Plank Road, a task the company completed by 1853. At [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]] the road connected with the Detroit<U+2013>Howell Plank Road, establishing the first improved connection direct from the state capital to Michigan's largest metropolis.  The Lansing<U+2013>Detroit Plank Road was a toll road until the 1880s.  It eventually evolved into the eastern part of the modern Grand River Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |last=Forsyth |first=Kevin S. |title=East Lansing: Origins |work=A Brief History of East Lansing, Michigan |url=http://kevinforsyth.net/ELMI/origins.htm |date=2003 |accessdate=September 14, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Grand River Avenue-Howell MI-1900.jpg|thumb|left|300px|West Grand River Avenue in Howell, 1900]]
By 1900, only a short stretch of the Detroit<U+2013>Howell Plank Road was still make of planks. Most of the plank roads had been converted to gravel by this time.<ref name=mason>[[#Mason|Mason]], p. 11.</ref> On the first map published on July 1, 1919, the [[Michigan State Highway Department]] (MSHD) had numbered and signed highways in the state.

The former routing through Downtown Lansing on Michigan Avenue became part of [[M-39 (Michigan highway)|M-39]] and the section north of Grand Ledge was eventually redesignated [[M-100 (Michigan highway)|M-100]]. A second realignment moved M-16 to follow Grand River Avenue from Ionia through Ada.

The M-16 designation lasted for seven years. As the states were meeting with the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO, now AASHTO) to plan the [[United States Numbered Highway System]], the route of M-16 was originally planned to be included in [[U.S. Route 18|US&nbsp;18]].<ref name="US1925">Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925</ref> When the system was announced on November 11, 1926,<ref name="USH">{{cite web |url=http://wwwcf.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/numbers.cfm |title= From Names to Numbers: The Origins of the U.S. Numbered Highway System |author= Weingroff, Richard F. |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate=April 21, 2009 |date=January 9, 2009}}</ref> Grand River Avenue and M-16 became part of [[U.S. Highway 16|US&nbsp;16]].<ref name="USHM">{{cite map| publisher=[[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=United States System of Highways |url=http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/misc-maps/1926us.pdf |year=1926 |accessdate=May 10, 2008}}</ref>

===US Highway to Interstate===
The first change to the US&nbsp;16 routing was made in 1933. The highway was moved to bypass Farmington, with the old routing retained as a state highway.<ref name="MSHD33-09">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=September 1, 1933 |cartography= H.M.

===Post-Interstate era===
After US&nbsp;16 was transferred to the new freeway, Grand River Avenue lost its state highway status along most of its length. Today the roadway remains the "[[Main Street]]" of over a dozen Michigan cities and a scenic route through one of the state's most populated corridors. In 1995, major reconstruction work along Grand River Avenue in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] uncovered rotting logs, buried about {{convert|2|ft}} below the present grade, that had been used as underlayment for the plank road surface in a low, swampy area.  The logs had been in place for nearly 150 years.<ref>{{cite web |last=Forsyth |first=Kevin S. |title=East Lansing's Plank Road, Rediscovered |work=A Brief History of East Lansing, Michigan |url=http://kevinforsyth.net/ELMI/plank-rd.htm |date=2003 |accessdate=September 14, 2007}}</ref> In 2004, the state transferred several blocks at the eastern end of Grand River Avenue to the City of Detroit.

Community leaders in Lansing have proposed renaming a section of Grand River Avenue in Old Town Lansing for [[C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez]], the Mexican-American civil rights activist. The group "Lansing for Cesar E. Chavez" was raising funds to rename the section of Grand River Avenue between Oakland and Pine Streets in Old Town. Previously, a section of Grand Avenue was renamed for Ch<U+00E1>vez in 1994, but the voters overturned the decision.<ref name=leppek >{{cite news |first=Kyle |last=Leppek |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-4197-avenida-chavez.html |title= Avenida Chavez: Naming a Street after the Labor Leader Hopes to Avoid Pitfalls of Last Go-Around |work=[[Lansing City Pulse]] |date= April 14, 2010 |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The renaming proposal was even mentioned as a way to untangle a maze of different branches of Grand River Avenue running through Old Town. Currently, East Grand River Avenue and North Grand River Avenue bridge between sections of Grand River Avenue, in addition to Grand Avenue which runs along the Grand River near downtown.<ref name=melinn>{{cite news |last=Melinn |first=Kyle |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-4448-the-drive-for-cesar-e-chavez-avenue.html  |title=The Drive for Cesar E. Chavez Avenue |work=Lansing City Pulse |date= June 16,2010 |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> While Lansing's Latino community supported the proposal, the business community opposed it. One shop owner said she would have $10,000 in costs associated with a name change, adding, "I think there's many beautiful ways to honor such an incredible man. Changing five blocks of a street doesn't seem to do justice." Another business owner cited the work the Old Town Commercial Association has done to market the area using the Grand River Avenue name; marketing that would be useless after a name change.<ref name=pohl>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Pohl |url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wium/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1662787/Local.Commentaries/Effort.to.rename.Grand.River.Avenue.in.Old.Town.Lansing.meeting.with.resistance |title= Effort to Rename Grand River Avenue in Old Town Lansing Meeting with Resistance |publisher= [[WKAR (AM)|WKAR-AM]]|location=Lansing |date=June 15,  2010 |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>  The compromise solution reached in August 2010 was to rename lot 56, where Old Town holds festivals to Cesar Chavez Plaza. Street signs would be installed marking parts of Grand River Avenue as Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, but only in a memorial capacity. The street would still be officially named Grand River Avenue.<ref name=maki>{{cite news |last=Maki |first=Jessica |url=http://www.wlns.com/Global/story.asp?S=12977360 |title= Supporters Happy Chavez Will Be Honored |publisher=[[WLNS|WLNS-TV]] |location=Lansing |date= August 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>
