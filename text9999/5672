'''Agafia Lykov''' (1943 -) is a Russian [[Old Believers|Old-Believer]] who has survived alone in the [[Taiga]] for most of her life. Lykov became a national phenomenon in the early 1980s when [[Vasily Peskov]] published articles about her [[Lykov family|family]] and their extreme isolation from the rest of society. <ref name=smith /> Lykov is the sole surviving member of the clan and has been mostly self-sufficient since 1988, when her father passed away. <ref name=vicew />

== Early Life ==

Agafia Lykov was born in a pine trough in 1943 to Karp Osipovich Lykov and Akulina Lykov.<ref name=lostintaiga /> She was their fourth child, and the second to be born in the Taiga. <ref name=smith>Dash, M. (2013, January 29). For forty years, this Russian family was cut off from all human contact, unaware of WWII. ''The Smithsonian''. Retrieved from http://www.smithsonianmag.com</ref> 

Lykov lives 500 feet up a remote mountainside in the [[Abakan Range]], 150 miles away from the nearest town. For the first 35 years of her life, Lykov did not have contact with anyone outside of her immediate family. Information about the outside world came from her father<U+2019>s stories and the family<U+2019>s [[Russian Orthodox]] bible. <ref name=vicev>Vice. (2013, April 1).

In the summer of 1978, a group of four geologists discovered the family by chance, while circling the area in a helicopter. The scientists reported that Lykov spoke a language <U+201C>distorted by a lifetime of isolation<U+201D> that sounded akin to a <U+201C>slow, blurred cooing.<U+201D> <ref name=lostintaiga /> This unusual speech led to the misconception that Lykov possessed little intelligence. Later, after observing her skill in hunting, cooking, sewing, reading and construction, this original misconception was revised. <ref name=lostintaiga>Peskov, V. (1994). ''Lost in the Taiga: One Russian family's 50 year struggle for survival and religious freedom in the Siberian wilderness''. ''The Smithsonian''. Retrieved from http://www.smithsonianmag.com</ref>

== Isolation ==

In 70 years, Lykov has ventured out of the family settlement six times. The first time was in the 1980s, shortly after [[Vasily Peskov]]'s articles about the family<U+2019>s isolation turned them into a national phenomenon. The Russian Government paid for her to tour [[Russia]] for a month, during which time she saw [[Airplane|planes]], [[horses]], [[cars]] and [[money]] for the first time. <ref name=vicew /> Since then, she has only left to seek medical treatment, visit distant relatives and to meet other [[Old Believers]]. <ref name=lostintaiga />

By and large, Lykov prefers her life in the Taiga to life in the larger towns or cities.<ref name=vicev /> She claims that the air and water outside of the Taiga makes her sick. She also said that she finds the busy roads frightening. <ref name=vicew>Martin, J. (2013, April 2). Meet the last Lykov. ''Vice Magazine''. Retrieved from http://www.vice.com/magazine/20/4</ref>

== Relationships ==

During her talks with Peskov, Lykov told him she was married to someone during one of her trips outside of the Taiga. No further information was offered.<ref name=lostintaiga />

For 16 years Lykov has had a neighbour, Yerofei Sedov. Sedov told [[vice (magazine)|Vice]] journalists that he came to the Taiga to help Lykov. Due to his old age and disability, however, he has heavily relied on Lykov for food and firewood throughout his stay. While the two are generally on friendly terms, there have been two occasions where Sedov threatened Lykov and <U+201C>committed sins.<U+201D> She does not elaborate as to what these sins were.<ref name=vicew /><ref name=vicev />
