'''Drax Power Station''' is a large [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired]] [[power station]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]], capable of [[co-firing]] [[biomass]] and [[petcoke]]. It is situated near the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] between [[Selby]] and [[Goole]], and its name comes from the nearby village of [[Drax, North Yorkshire|Drax]]. Its generating capacity of 3,960 [[megawatt]]s is the highest of any power station in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, providing about 7% of the United Kingdom's electricity supply.

Opened in 1974 and extended in the mid-1980s, the station was initially operated by the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]], but since [[privatisation]] in 1990 the station has changed owner several times, and is currently operated by [[Drax Group|Drax Group plc]]. Completed in 1986, Drax is the most recently built coal-fired power station, and by implementing technologies such as [[flue gas desulphurisation]], is one of the cleanest and most efficient coal-fired power stations in the UK.<ref name=history /> However, because of its large size, it is also the UK's single largest emitter of [[carbon dioxide]]. In an attempt to reduce these emissions, the station is currently co-firing biomass and undergoing a turbine refurbishment, and there are plans to build a biomass only fired plant alongside the station, known as [[Drax Ouse Renewable Energy Plant]].

==History==
After the [[Selby Coalfield]] was discovered in 1967 the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]] built three large power stations to utilise its coal.<ref name=antique>{{cite web

===Post-privatisation===
On [[privatisation]] of the UK's [[Electrical power industry|electric supply industry]] in 1990, the operation of Drax Power Station was transferred from the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]] to the privatised generating company [[National Power]]. They sold it on to the [[AES Corporation]] in November 1999 for <U+00A3>1.87&nbsp;billion (US$3&nbsp;billion).<ref name=history /> AES relinquished ownership of the station in August 2003, after falling into <U+00A3>1.3&nbsp;billion of debt. Independent directors continued the operation of the station to ensure security of supply.<ref name=future>{{cite web

When the station first opened, the majority of the coal burned there was taken from various local collieries in Yorkshire. These collieries included: [[Kellingley Colliery|Kellingley]], Prince of Wales, [[Featherstone|Ackton Hall]], [[Sharlston, West Yorkshire|Sharlston]], [[Fryston village|Fryston]], [[Askern]] and [[Bentley, South Yorkshire|Bentley]]. However, since the [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|miners' strike]] in the mid-1980s, all but one of these mines have shut, with the pit at Kellingley being the only one of these still open.<ref name=kellingley>{{cite web

===Cooling system===
[[File:Drax cooling tower.jpg|thumb|right|12 cooling towers cool the station's condenser water]]
Water is essential to a [[thermal power station]], as water is heated to create steam to turn the [[steam turbines]]. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on-site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled using condensers. Water for these condensers is taken from the nearby [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]].<ref name=enviro_2006>{{cite web

===Flue gas desulphurisation===
[[File:Drax gypsum train.jpg|thumb|right|A train of gypsum heading from the station to [[Kirkby Thore]] on the [[Settle-Carlisle Railway]].]]
All six units are served by independent wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gasses from the boilers and passes them through a [[limestone]] slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the gasses. This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO<sub>2</sub> from the station's emissions each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week.<ref name=clevelandbridge /> This limestone is sourced from [[Tunstead, Derbyshire|Tunstead Quarry]] in [[Derbyshire]].<ref name=gypsum>{{cite web

===Ash use and disposal===
[[Pulverised fuel ash]] (PFA) and [[Bottom ash|furnace bottom ash]] (FBA) are two byproducts made through the burning of coal. Each year, the station produces about 1,000,000 tonnes of PFA and around 220,000 tonnes of FBA. Most of this ash is sold on, with all FBA and 85% of PFA being sold.<ref name=PFA /> Under the trade name Drax Ash Products, the sold ash is sold to the local [[building industry]], where it is used in the manufacture of [[Concrete masonry unit|blocks]], [[cement]] products, [[grout|grouting]] and the laying of roads.<ref name=byproducts>{{cite web

}}</ref> The ash is also used in other parts of the country. Between 2005 and 2007, PFA was used as an infill at four disused [[salt mine]]s in [[Northwich]] in [[Cheshire]]. 1,100,000 tonnes of PFA was used in the project, which was to avoid a future risk of subsidence in the town. Ash was delivered by EWS in ten trains a week, each carrying 1,100 tonnes of PFA.<ref name=PFA />

The unsold PFA is sent by [[conveyor belt]] to the [[Barlow, North Yorkshire|Barlow]] ash mound, which is used for disposal and temporary stockpile. Three conveyors feed the mound, with a total capacity of delivering 750 tonnes of PFA an hour.<ref name=PFA>{{cite web

===Co-firing===
[[Co-firing]] is the process of burning two or more types of fuel together at the same time. As well as burning coal, Drax power station also co-fires [[biomass]] and [[petcoke]]. The station tested co-firing biomass in the summer of 2004, and in doing so was the first power station in the UK to be fueled by wood. The initial trial of 14,100 tonnes of [[willow]] was locally sourced from nearby [[Eggborough]].<ref>{{cite web

Since the trial, the station's use of biomass has continued. The station uses direct injection for firing the biomass, whereby it bypasses the station's pulverising mills and is either injected dirctly into the boiler or the fuel line, for greater throughput of biomass.<ref>{{cite web

The station started to trial the co-firing of petcoke in one of its boilers in June 2005.<ref name=yp /> The trial ended in June 2007.<ref name=enviro_2007 /> Over this period the boiler burned 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned in the station to make the price of the station's electricity more competetive as the price of running the station's FGD equipment was making the station's electricity more expensive. The [[Environment Agency]] (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Selby (district)|Selby Council]].<ref name=yp>{{cite web

==Environmental effects==
[[File:Drax Power Station - geograph.org.uk - 1237044.jpg|thumb|right|Drax power station is the largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitter in the UK]]
The [[environmental effects of coal]] burning are well documented, the most significant of which is [[global warming]], caused by the release of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into the earth's atmosphere. Coal is considered to be "easily the most carbon-intensive and polluting form of energy generation available".<ref>{{cite web

In 2007, in a move to try and lower the station's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, Drax Group signed a <U+00A3>100&nbsp;million contract with [[Siemens Power Generation]] to re-blade the station's steam turbines over the course of four years. This is the largest steam turbine modernisation ever undertaken in the UK, and will increase the station's efficiency. This, coupled with the co-firing of [[biomass]], is part of a target to reduce the station's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 15% by 2011.<ref name=reblade>{{cite web

==Protests and industrial action==
===Climate Camp===
On 31 August 2006, over 600 people attended a protest against the power station's high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the [[Camp for Climate Action]]  group. At least 3,000 police officers from 12 forces were reported to have been drafted in for the duration of the protest, to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent the protesters from shutting the station down. Thirty-nine people were arrested during the protest after after trying illegally to gain access to the plant.<ref>{{cite web

===Train protest===
At 8:00 am on 13 June 2008, more than 30 climate change campaigners halted a [[EWS]] coal train en-route to Drax power station by disguising themselves as rail workers by wearing [[high-visibility clothing]] and waving [[red flag]]s. Stopping the train on a bridge crossing the [[River Aire]], they scaled the wagons with the aid of the bridge's girders. They then mounted a banner reading "Leave it in the ground" to the side of the wagon and tied the train to the bridge, preventing it moving. They then shoveled more than 20&nbsp;tonnes of coal on to the railway line. The protest lasted the whole day, until several protesters were removed from the train by police that night. The station's management said that the protest had no effect on power station's output. The action was also coordinated by Camp for Climate Action.<ref>{{cite web

==Future==
===Biomass power station===
{{main|Drax Ouse Renewable Energy Plant}}

[[Drax Group]] have applied for planning permission to build a new 300&nbsp;MW power station, fueled entirely by biomass, to the north of the current power station site. The Ouse Renewable Energy Plant is expected to burn 1,400,000 tonnes of biomass each year, saving 1,850,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per annum. If the plans go ahead, 850 construction jobs will be created and 150 permanent jobs created once opened through direct and contract employment.<ref>{{cite web

===Carbon capture and storage===
On 17 June 2009, [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]] [[Ed Miliband]] announced that all UK coal-fired power stations may be fitted with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology by the early 2020s or face closure. Drax currently has made no statement on the viability of CCS technology at the power station. If it was necessary to install CCS technology at Drax, it would require the construction of new turbines and boilers, and a secure way of transporting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions {{convert|64|km|abbr=on}} to the Yorkshire coast.<ref>{{cite web
