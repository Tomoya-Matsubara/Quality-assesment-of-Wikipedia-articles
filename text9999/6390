'''''Calvin and Hobbes''''' is <!-- do not change to "was" per Wikipedia guidelines for fiction --> a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] daily [[comic strip]] written and illustrated by American [[cartoonist]] [[Bill Watterson]], and [[Print syndication|syndicated]] from November 18, 1985 to December 31, 1995.  It follows the humorous antics of [[Calvin (Calvin and Hobbes)|Calvin]], a precocious and adventurous six-year-old boy, and [[Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)|Hobbes]], his sardonic [[stuffed toy|stuffed]] [[tiger]]. The pair are named after [[John Calvin]], a 16th-century French [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[Theology|theologian]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]], a 17th-century English [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/trivia.html| title=Calvin and Hobbes Trivia| publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]| accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>  At its height, ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was featured in over 2,400 newspapers worldwide; as of January 2010,{{update after|2011|2|1}} reruns of the strip still appear in more than 50 countries. Nearly 45 million copies of the [[List of Calvin and Hobbes books|18 ''Calvin and Hobbes'' books]] have been sold.<ref name="cleve2010">{{cite web | title= 'Calvin and Hobbes' fans still pine 15 years after its exit | publisher=[[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)|The Plain Dealer]] | url= http://www.cleveland.com/living/index.ssf/2010/02/bill_watterson_creator_of_belo.html | author = John Campanelli| date=February 1, 2010 | accessdate=2010-02-02 }}</ref>

Calvin and Hobbes is set in the contemporary [[Midwestern United States]] in an unspecified [[suburb]]an community.  The strip depicts Calvin's flights of fantasy and his friendship with Hobbes. The strip also examines Calvin's relationships with family and classmates. The dual nature of Hobbes is a recurring motif. Calvin's friend Hobbes is a [[Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes character)#Hobbes' |live anthropomorphic tiger]] to him, while other characters see him as a stuffed toy. Though the series does not mention specific political figures or current events, it does explore broad issues like [[environmentalism]], [[public education]], and the flaws of [[Opinion poll#Potential for inaccuracy|opinion poll]]s.<ref name="astor1989">{{cite news | title=Watterson and Walker Differ On Comics: "Calvin and Hobbes" creator criticizes today's cartooning while "Beetle Bailey"/"Hi and Lois" creator defends it at meeting | publisher=Editor and Publisher | author=David Astor | date=November 4, 1989 | page=78}}</ref>  

==History==
{{rquote|right|I thought it was perhaps too 'adult,' too literate.  When my then-8-year-old son remarked, "This is the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' for kids!"

''Calvin and Hobbes'' was conceived when  Bill Watterson, having worked in an advertising job he detested,<ref name="detest">{{cite web |

He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates.  [[United Media|United Feature Syndicate]] finally responded positively to one strip, which featured a side character (the main character's little brother) who had a stuffed tiger. Told that these characters were the strongest, Watterson began a new strip centered on them.<ref name="tucker2005">{{cite news | title=The Tiger Strikes Again | author=Neely Tucker | date=October 4, 2005 | publisher=Washington Post|page=C01}}</ref>  But United Feature rejected the new strip, and Watterson endured a few more rejections before [[Universal Press Syndicate]] decided to take it.<ref name="simple">{{cite news |  title=Calvin and Hobbes Creator Draws On the Simple Life | author=Paul Dean | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=May 26, 1987}}</ref><ref name="christie1987">{{cite news | title=An Interview With Bill Watterson: The creator of Calvin and Hobbes on cartooning, syndicates, Garfield, Charles Schulz, and editors | author=Andrew Christie | publisher=Honk magazine |month=January | year=1987}}</ref>

The first strip was published on November 18, 1985, and the series quickly became a hit. Within a year of [[print syndication|syndication]], the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers. Before long the strip was in [[Calvin and Hobbes in translation|wide circulation]] outside the United States. By April 1, 1987, Watterson and his work were featured in an article by ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name="simple" /> ''Calvin and Hobbes'' twice earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the [[National Cartoonists Society]] in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988. He was nominated again in 1992. The Society awarded him the Humor Comic Strip Award for 1988.<ref name="reuben">{{cite web | title = NCS Reuben Award winners (1975<U+2013>present) | work = National Cartoonists Society | url = http://www.reuben.org/ncs/archive/divisions/reuben2.asp| accessdate = July 12, 2005 }}</ref>

Watterson took two extended breaks from writing new strips, from May 1991 to February 1992, and from April through December 1994.
In 1995, Watterson sent a letter via his syndicate to all editors whose newspapers carried his strip:

{{quotation|I will be stopping ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.

That so many newspapers would carry ''Calvin and Hobbes'' is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.}}

The 3,160th and final strip ran on Sunday, December 31, 1995.<ref name="pr_calvin">{{cite web | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/pr_calvin.html| work=Andrews McMeel Press Release|accessdate = 2009-05-02|title=The Complete Calvin and Hobbes|publisher=[[Andrews & McMeel]]}}</ref> It depicted Calvin and Hobbes outside in freshly-fallen snow, reveling in the wonder and excitement of the winter scene.

===Syndication and formatting===
From the outset, Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate, which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips. Watterson refused. To him, the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by [[commercialization]], which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art.<ref name="west1989">{{cite journal| author = Richard Samuel West| title = Interview: Bill Watterson| journal = Comics Journal| month = February | year = 1989| url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ccomicsjournal.html| issue = 127}}</ref>

Watterson also grew increasingly frustrated by the gradual shrinking of available space for comics in the newspapers. He lamented that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or spare artwork, comics as an art form were becoming dilute, bland, and unoriginal.<ref name="west1989" /><ref name="astor1988">{{cite news | title=Watterson Knocks the Shrinking of Comics | author=David Astor | publisher=Editor and Publisher | date=December 3, 1988 | page=40}}</ref> Watterson strove for a full-page version of his strip, in contrast to the few cells allocated for most strips. He longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as ''[[Little Nemo]]'' and ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', and he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation, ''The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book''.<ref name="cheapening">{{cite web | last=Watterson | first=Bill | authorlink=Bill Watterson | year=1989 | url=http://www.planetcartoonist.com/editorial/state_watterson.shtml | title=The Cheapening of Comics | publisher=PlanetCartoonist | accessdate = 2006-03-16 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070209234303/http://www.planetcartoonist.com/editorial/state_watterson.shtml |archivedate=2007-02-09}}</ref>

During Watterson's first [[sabbatical]] from the strip, Universal Press Syndicate continued to charge newspapers full price to re-run old ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strips. Few editors approved of the move, but the strip was so popular that they had little choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away.<ref>{{cite news |last=Astor |first=David |title=Nine-month Vacation For Bill Watterson |page=34 |publisher=Editor & Publisher |date=1991-03-30}}</ref>

[[File:Comics half page.svg|thumb|right|This half-page layout can easily be rearranged for [[:File:Comics full page.svg|full]], [[:File:Comics third page.svg|third]], and [[:File:Comics quarter page.svg|quarter]] pages.]]
Upon Watterson's return, Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or [[tabloid]] page. Many editors and even a few cartoonists criticized him<ref name="keanecriticism">{{cite news | last = Astor | first = David | title = Cartoonists discuss 'Calvin' requirement | page = 34 | publisher = Editor & Publisher | date = 1992-03-07 | url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1165165 | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}</ref> for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business. Watterson had negotiated the deal to allow himself more creative freedom in the Sunday comics. Watterson's explanation for the switch:

<blockquote>I took a sabbatical after resolving a long and emotionally draining fight to prevent ''Calvin and Hobbes'' from being merchandised. Looking for a way to rekindle my enthusiasm for the duration of a new contract term, I proposed a redesigned Sunday format that would permit more panel flexibility. To my surprise and delight, Universal responded with an offer to market the strip as an unbreakable half page (more space than I'd dared to ask for), despite the expected resistance of editors.

To this day, my syndicate assures me that some editors liked the new format, appreciated the difference, and were happy to run the larger strip, but I think it's fair to say that this was not the most common reaction. The syndicate had warned me to prepare for numerous cancellations of the Sunday feature, but after a few weeks of dealing with howling, purple-faced editors, the syndicate suggested that papers could reduce the strip to the size tabloid newspapers used for their smaller sheets of paper. ... I focused on the bright side: I had complete freedom of design and there were virtually no cancellations.

For all the yelling and screaming by outraged editors, I remain convinced that the larger Sunday strip gave newspapers a better product and made the comics section more fun for readers. Comics are a visual medium. A strip with a lot of drawing can be exciting and add some variety. Proud as I am that I was able to draw a larger strip, I don't expect to see it happen again any time soon. In the newspaper business, space is money, and I suspect most editors would still say that the difference is not worth the cost. Sadly, the situation is a vicious circle: because there's no room for better artwork, the comics are simply drawn; because they're simply drawn, why should they have more room?<ref name="sundaypages">{{cite book | last=Watterson | first=Bill | title=Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985<U+2013>1995 | month=September | year=2001 | page=15 | isbn = 0-7407-2135-6 | publisher=A. McMeel Pub. | location=Kansas City, MO}}</ref></blockquote>

===Animation===
Watterson did consider allowing Calvin and Hobbes to be [[animation|animated]], and has expressed admiration for the art form. In a 1989 interview in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' he said:

{{quotation|If you look at the old cartoons by [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]], you'll see that there are a lot of things single drawings just can't do. Animators can get away with incredible distortion and exaggeration... because the animator can control the length of time you see something. The bizarre exaggeration barely has time to register, and the viewer doesn't ponder the incredible license he's witnessed.

In a comic strip, you just show the highlights of action <U+2013> you can't show the buildup and release... or at least not without slowing down the pace of everything to the point where it's like looking at individual frames of a movie, in which case you've probably lost the effect you were trying to achieve. In a comic strip, you can suggest motion and time, but it's very crude compared to what an animator can do. I have a real awe for good animation.<ref name="west1989"/>}}

After this he was asked if it was "a bit scary to think of hearing Calvin's voice". He responded that it was "very scary", and that although he loved the visual possibilities of animation, the thought of casting voice actors to play his characters was uncomfortable. He was also unsure whether he wanted to work with an animation team, as he had done all previous work by himself.<ref name="west1989"/> Ultimately, ''Calvin and Hobbes'' was never made into an [[Animated cartoon|animated series]]. Watterson later stated in the ''Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'' that he liked the fact that his strip was a "low-tech, one-man operation", and took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 11</ref>

==Merchandising==
Bill Watterson insists that cartoon strips should stand on their own as an art form and has resisted the use of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' in merchandising of any sort.<ref name="christie1987" /> Watterson explained in a 2005 press release:

{{quotation|Actually, I wasn't against all merchandising when I started the strip, but each product I considered seemed to violate the spirit of the strip, contradict its message, and take me away from the work I loved. If my syndicate had let it go at that, the decision would have taken maybe 30 seconds of my life.<ref name = "amiv"/>}}

Almost no legitimate ''Calvin and Hobbes'' merchandise exists outside of the book collections.<ref name="items">{{cite web | url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/citems.html | title=A Concise Guide To All Legitimate (and some not-so-legitimate) Merchandise | accessdate = 2006-03-16}}</ref> Exceptions include two 16-month calendars (1988<U+2013>1989 and 1989<U+2013>1990), the textbook ''Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes'',<ref name="twch">{{cite book | title=Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes | isbn=1-878849-15-8 | last=Holmen | first=Linda | publisher=Playground | year=1993}}</ref> the textbook ''The Fallacy Detective'',<ref name="tfd">{{cite book | title="The Fallacy Detective | isbn=0974531502 | last=Bluedorn | first=Hans | publisher=Christian Logic | year=2002}}</ref> and one T-shirt for a traveling art exhibit on comics.

However, the strip's immense popularity has led to the appearance of various [[counterfeit]] items such as window decals and T-shirts that often feature [[Off-color humor|crude humor]], [[binge drinking]] and other themes that are not found in Watterson's work.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 12</ref> After threat of a lawsuit alleging infringement of copyright and trademark, some sticker makers replaced Calvin with a different boy, while other makers made no changes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |title=Calvin's Unauthorized Leak: Stock Car Fans Misuse Comics Character |publisher=Washington Post |page=B9 |date=1997-07-17 |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> Watterson wryly commented, "I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] logo."<ref name="amiv" />

==Style and influences==
Precedents to Calvin's fantasy world can be found in [[Crockett Johnson]]'s ''[[Barnaby (comic strip)|Barnaby]]'', [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', [[Percy Crosby]]'s ''[[Skippy (comic strip)|Skippy]]'', [[Berkeley Breathed]]'s ''[[Bloom County]]'', and [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', while Watterson's use of comics as sociopolitical commentary reaches back to [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' and [[Quino]]'s ''[[Mafalda]]''. Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson's outlook on comics during his formative years.<ref name="christie1987" />

In addition to philosophical antecedents to Watterson<U+2019>s work, he references preexisting, archetypical cartoon characters as a tool to create empathetic responses in the reader. Echoes of not only Charlie Brown, but also of [[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]], induce a nostalgic and warmhearted response in the new reader of any Calvin and Hobbes strip, even as the subject matter challenges that viewer to consider its extra-comical implications.

In initial strips the drawings have a flatter, ''[[Peanuts]]''-like look; in later strips, the drawings show more depth. Notable elements of Watterson's artistic style are his characters' diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin's flights of imagination, expressions of motion, and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later years of the strip, with more space available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue, and greater use of [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]]. He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly: the "Noodle Incident" and the [[Children's literature|children's book]] ''Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie'' are left to the reader's imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be "more outrageous" than he could portray.<ref name="Tenth_p200">[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 200.</ref>

Watterson's technique started with minimalist [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil sketches]] drawn with a [[light pencil]] (though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work); he then would use a small [[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|sable]] brush and [[India ink]] on the Strathmore [[bristol board]] to complete most of the remaining drawing. He lettered dialogue with a [[Rotring|Rapidograph]] [[fountain pen]], and he used a [[quill|crowquill]] pen for odds and ends.<ref name="Watterson (1995) p 20">[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 20</ref> He used [[Liquid Paper]] to correct mistakes. He was careful in his use of color, often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip.<ref name="watterson2001">{{cite book | authorlink = Bill Watterson | last = Watterson | first = Bill | title = Calvin and Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985<U+2013>1995 | publisher = Andrews McMeel | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7407-2135-6 }}</ref> When ''Calvin and Hobbes'' started there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips. For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other.<ref name="Watterson (1995) p 20"/>

===Art and academia===
Watterson used the strip to poke fun at the art world, principally through Calvin's unconventional creations of [[snowman|snowmen]] but also through other expressions of childhood art. When Miss Wormwood complains that he is wasting class time drawing impossible things (a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' in a rocket ship, for example), Calvin proclaims himself "on the cutting edge of the ''[[avant-garde]]''." He begins exploring the medium of snow when a warm day melts his snowman. His next sculpture "speaks to the horror of our own mortality, inviting the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life." In further strips, Calvin's creative instincts diversify to include sidewalk drawings (or as he terms them, examples of "suburban [[postmodernism]]").

Watterson also lampooned the [[academia|academic world]]. In one example, Calvin writes a "[[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] [[autobiography]]," recruiting Hobbes to take pictures of him doing stereotypical kid activities like playing sports in order to make him seem more well-adjusted. In another strip, he carefully crafts an "[[artist's statement]]", claiming that such essays convey more messages than artworks themselves ever do (Hobbes blandly notes "You misspelled ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''"). He indulges in what Watterson calls "[[psychobabble|pop psychobabble]]" to justify his destructive rampages and shift blame to his parents, citing "[[Codependence|toxic codependency]]". In one instance, he pens a book report based on the theory that the purpose of academic writing is to "inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning, and inhibit clarity," titled ''The Dynamics of Interbeing and Monological Imperatives in ''[[Dick and Jane]]:'' A Study in Psychic Transrelational Gender Modes.'' Displaying his creation to Hobbes, he remarks, "Academia, here I come!" Watterson explains that he adapted this jargon (and similar examples from several other strips) from an actual book of art criticism.<ref name="watterson1995">{{cite book | authorlink = Bill Watterson | last = Watterson | first = Bill | title = The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book | publisher = Andrews McMeel | month = October | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>

Overall, Watterson's satirical essays serve to attack both sides, criticizing both the commercial mainstream and the artists who are supposed to be "outside" it. Not long after he began drawing his "Dinosaurs in Rocket Ships" series, Calvin tells Hobbes:

{{quotation|Calvin: The hard part for us ''avant-garde'' post-modern artists is deciding whether or not to embrace [[commercialism]]. Do we allow our work to be hyped and exploited by a market that's simply hungry for the next new thing? Do we participate in a system that turns high art into low art so it's better suited for mass consumption?

Of course, when an artist goes commercial, he makes a mockery of his status as an outsider and free thinker. He buys into the crass and shallow values art should transcend. He trades the integrity of his art for riches and fame.
<br>...<br>
Oh, what the heck. I'll do it.
<br>...<br>
Hobbes: (Rolling eyes) That wasn't so hard.}}

The strip for Sunday, June 21, 1992 criticized the naming of the [[Big Bang]] as unevocative of the wonders behind it.<ref>[http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/05/05/ Online] at gocomics.com with a date of May 5, 1991.</ref> The strip coined "Horrendous Space Kablooie," an alternative which has achieved some popularity among the scientific community, particularly in informal discussion and often shortened to "the HSK."<ref name="sampson">{{cite book |authorlink=Simon Singh |last=Singh |first=Simon |title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=2006 |isbn=978-0007162208}}</ref> The term has also been referenced in newspapers,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D91E31F932A25755C0A965958260|title= Calling 'Big Bang' a Dud, Journal Seeks New Name|publisher=New York Times|date=1993-06-11|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/10/24/bosin24.xml&sSheet=/arts/2004/10/24/bomain.html|title=We are wandering stardust|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=2004-10-17|accessdate=2008-02-27 | location=London | first=Andy | last=Martin}}</ref> books,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1fKKq44B9ewC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=horrendous+space+kablooie|title=Creation, Evolution, and Modern Science|author=Kerby Anderson, Raymond G.

===Social criticisms===
With rare exception, the strip avoids reference to actual people or events. Watterson lampoons public decadence and apathy, commercialism, and the pandering nature of the mass media.

In one instance, Calvin tells Hobbes about a science fiction story he has read in which machines turn humans into zombie slaves. Hobbes comments about the irony of machines controlling people instead of the other way around; Calvin then exclaims, "I'll say. Hey! What time is it?? My TV show is on!" and sprints back inside to watch it. Another strip depicts Calvin's [[science fiction]] story about an extraterrestrial spaceship sucking up Earth's oceans and air.  To the cries of the suffocating victims, the aliens reply that this is preferable to the loss of their jobs.  Calvin is concerned that his story is too far-fetched, to which Hobbes responds "Not enough, really".

===Calvin===
{{Main|Calvin (Calvin and Hobbes)}}
[[File:Calvin & Hobbes - Calvin.png|framed|right|alt=Calvin|Calvin]]
Named after the 16th-century [[John Calvin|theologian]], Calvin is an impulsive, sometimes overly creative, imaginative, energetic, curious, intelligent, often selfish, rude, and bad-tempered six-year-old, whose last name is never mentioned in the strip.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Watterson  | first = Bill  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  | publisher = Andrews and McMeel  | year = 1995  | location =   | page = 21  | url =   | doi =   | isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref> Despite his low grades, Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through his sophisticated vocabulary and a philosophical mind:

{{quotation| Calvin: "Dad, are you vicariously living through me in the hope that my accomplishments will validate your mediocre life and in some way compensate for all of the opportunities you botched?"<br />
Father: "If I were, you can bet I'd be re-evaluating my strategy."<br />
Calvin, later to his mother: "Mom, Dad keeps insulting me."}}

He commonly wears his distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, black pants, and white-and-magenta sneakers.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 1, p. 303. Comic originally published 1987-07-26.</ref> He is also an enthusiastic reader of comic books and has a tendency to order items marketed in comic books or on boxes of his favorite cereal, Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs. Watterson described Calvin:

{{quotation|Calvin is pretty easy to do because he is outgoing and rambunctious and there's not much of a filter between his brain and his mouth.
I guess he's a little too intelligent for his age. The thing that I really enjoy about him is that he has no sense of restraint, he doesn't have the experience yet to know the things that you shouldn't do.<ref name="williams1987">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Gene | year = 1987 | title = Watterson: Calvin's other alter ego | work = [[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]}}</ref>}}

===Hobbes===
{{Main|Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes)}}
[[File:Calvin & Hobbes - Hobbes.png|framed|right|alt=Hobbes|Hobbes]]
From the other characters' perspectives, Hobbes is Calvin's stuffed tiger. From Calvin's point of view Hobbes is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tiger, much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas. When the perspective shifts to any other character, readers again see merely a stuffed animal, usually seated at an off-kilter angle and blankly staring into space. Watterson explains:

{{quotation|"When Hobbes is a stuffed toy in one panel and alive in the next, I'm juxtaposing the 'grown-up' version of reality with Calvin's version, and inviting the reader to decide which is truer."<ref name="christie1987" />}}

Hobbes' true nature is made more ambiguous by episodes that seem to attribute real-life consequences to Hobbes' actions. For example, Hobbes plays a game of pouncing on Calvin the moment he arrives home from school, an act which always leaves Calvin with bruises and scrapes that are evident to other characters. Hobbes also manages to tie Calvin to a chair in such a way that Calvin's father is unable to understand how he could have done it himself.

Hobbes is named after the 17th-century [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Thomas Hobbes]], who had what Watterson described as "a dim view of human nature."<ref name="watterson1995"/> Hobbes (the tiger) is much more rational and aware of consequences than Calvin, but seldom interferes with Calvin's troublemaking beyond a few oblique warnings. Hobbes is sarcastic when Calvin is being hypocritical about things he dislikes.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Watterson  | first = Bill  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  | publisher = Andrews and McMeel  | year = 1995  | location =   | page = 22  | url =   | doi =   | isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>

Although the debut strip clearly shows Calvin capturing Hobbes by means of a snare (with a tuna sandwich as the bait), a later comic (August 1, 1989) indicates that Hobbes has been with Calvin since Calvin was a baby:

{{quotation|
Calvin: "The whole first half of my life is a complete blank! What on earth did I know that someone wanted me to forget?" <br />
Hobbes: "I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up."<ref>http://www.s-anand.net/calvinandhobbes.html#19940809</ref>}}

Watterson eventually decided that it was not important to establish how Calvin and Hobbes met.<ref name="watterson1995"/>

===Calvin's parents===
Calvin's [[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Calvin's mother|mother]] and [[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Calvin's father|father]] are American [[middle class|middle-class]] parents. Like many other characters in the strip, their relatively down-to-earth and sensible attitudes serve as a foil for Calvin's outlandish behavior.

Watterson says some fans were angered by the way Calvin's parents thought of Calvin (his father remarks that he would have preferred a dog to Calvin and often doubts that Calvin is his real son). Calvin's parents are not above some outrageous behavior of their own. For example, Calvin asks for a cigarette and his mother gives him one to teach him a lesson. Calvin's father tells Calvin outlandish lies when asked a straight question and Calvin often believes them:
{{quotation|Calvin: Dad, were there dinosaurs when you were a kid? <br />
Dad: Oh, sure, your grandfather and I used to put on our leopard skins and hunt brontosaurus for all the clan rituals.}}

Other "explanations" from Calvin's father include: ice floats in order to get closer to the sun, the world was in black and white (like in old photographs) until the mid-1930s, and light bulbs work by magic. To this last "explanation," Calvin argues that light bulbs are not magic. Calvin's father replies, "Fine, don't believe your own father who has been around a lot longer than you." Then Calvin turns on a lamp in front of his mom, and says "Look, mom, magic!" To this his mom replies "That's not magic."

Watterson defends what Calvin's parents do, remarking that in the case of parenting a kid like Calvin, "I think they do a better job than I would." Calvin's father is concerned with "character building" activities in a number of strips, either in the things he makes Calvin do or in the eccentricities of his own lifestyle. For example, Calvin's father is shown coming home from an early morning bike ride in the snow, which he follows with a bowl of cold [[oatmeal]].

Calvin's father is a [[patent attorney]] and his mother is a [[Homemaker|stay-at-home mom]]. Both remain unnamed except as "Mom" and "Dad", or pet names such as "honey" and "dear" between themselves. Watterson said "as far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad." Calvin's Uncle Max was in the strip for a week and could not refer to the parents by name, which was one of the main reasons Max never reappeared.<ref name="watterson1995"/>

===Susie Derkins===
[[Susie Derkins]], the only important character with both a first and last name, is a classmate of Calvin's who lives in his neighborhood. Named for the pet [[beagle]] of Watterson's wife's family,<ref name="chars">{{cite web | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/characters.html | title=Cast of Characters | publisher=Andrew McMeel | work=The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (press release) | accessdate = 2006-03-19 | author=Bill Watterson}}</ref> she appeared early in the strip as a new student in Calvin's class. She is polite and studious, with a mild imagination consisting of [[stereotype|stereotypical]] young girl games such as playing house or having tea parties with her stuffed animals. However, she is also depicted playing imaginary games with Calvin in which she is a high-powered lawyer or politician and he is her house-husband. Though both of them hate to admit it, Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common. For example, Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed rabbit dubbed "[[Secondary characters in Calvin and Hobbes#Mr. Bun|Mr. Bun]]", and Calvin, of course, has Hobbes. Susie also has a mischievous (and sometimes aggressive) streak, which can be seen when she subverts Calvin's attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers, or clobbers Calvin when he attacks her with snowballs. Susie also regularly bests Calvin in confrontations such as their water and snowball fights, employing guile or force. Hobbes often openly expresses his feelings for Susie, much to Calvin's disgust. Calvin starts a "club" (he and Hobbes are the only members) which he calls G.R.O.S.S. ('''G'''et '''R'''id '''O'''f '''S'''limy girl'''S''') club, and while holding "meetings" in Calvin's treehouse or in the "box of secrecy" in Calvin's room, they usually come up with some way to annoy or socially maim Susie, most of which usually backfire on them completely. Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other, and that Susie is inspired by the type of woman that Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married.<ref name="watterson1995"/>

===Secondary characters===
Calvin also interacts with several secondary characters. These include his [[babysitter]], the school bully, and his schoolteacher.

====Rosalyn====
Rosalyn is Calvin's [[babysitter]]. She takes advantage of his parents' desperation to leave the house by demanding advances and raises. In her final appearance in the strip, she at last forces Calvin to behave by using his own haphazard rules against him during a game of Calvinball.  She is also probably the only character in the strip that Calvin really fears, as she does not mince words or actions to get Calvin to behave or go to bed on time. Watterson put her in a Sunday strip early on, never thinking of her as a regular character. But Rosalyn's intimidation of Calvin surprised Watterson, so she came back several times. Rosalyn even teaches Calvin's swim lessons when his Mom signed him up one time.

====Moe====
Moe is the stereotypical [[Bullying|bully]] character, a large, cruel, dimwitted "six-year-old who shaves" who shoves Calvin against walls or onto the ground while demanding his lunch money and calling him "Twinky", "Twinkie", "Twerp", or occasionally "Squirt". Moe is the only regular character who speaks in an unusual font: his (frequently monosyllabic) dialogue is shown in crude, lower-case letters. Watterson describes Moe as "every jerk I've ever known."<ref name="watterson1995"/>

====Miss Wormwood====
Miss Wormwood is Calvin's world-weary teacher, named after the junior devil in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''. She usually wears polka-dotted dresses, and is another character who serves as a foil to Calvin's mischief. Calvin, when in his Spaceman Spiff persona, sees Miss Wormwood as a slimy, often dictatorial alien.  Calvin refers to Miss Wormwood's indigestion ("It's really gross how she drinks [[Maalox]] straight from the bottle"), her medication ("I wonder if her doctor knows she mixes all those prescriptions") and her smoking habit ("Rumor has it she's up to two packs a day, unfiltered"). Miss Wormwood reacts to Calvin's behavior by squinting her eyes and thinking "Five years until retirement" repeatedly.  Watterson describes her as "an unhappy person" due to her belief in the value of education.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 25</ref>

==Recurring elements==
There are many recurring gags in the strip, some in "reality" and others in Calvin's imagination. These are as follows:

===Calvin's roles===
{{Main|Calvin's alter egos (Calvin and Hobbes)}}

Calvin imagines himself as a great many things, including [[dinosaur]]s, [[elephant]]s, jungle-farers and superheroes. Three of his [[alter ego]]s are well-defined and recurring:

* "Spaceman Spiff" is a heroic spacefarer who narrates his experiences in the third person. As Spiff, Calvin battles aliens (typically his parents or teacher) with a ray gun known as a "zorcher" (later "death ray blaster", a water gun) and travels to distant planets (his house, school, or neighborhood). Calvin's self-narration as Spaceman Spiff is frequently riddled with alliteration: "Zounds! Zorched by zarches, Spaceman Spiff's crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg!"<ref>[[Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons]]  This is probably Calvin's most common alter ego. p 95</ref>

* "Tracer Bullet," a [[hardboiled]] private eye, says he has eight slugs in him. "One's lead, and the rest are bourbon." In one story Bullet is called to a case in which a "pushy dame" (Calvin's mother) accuses him of destroying an expensive lamp (broken during an indoor football game between Calvin and Hobbes). Later, he is snatched by the pushy dame's "hired goon" (Calvin's father having a talk with him). He made his debut when Calvin donned a [[fedora]]-type hat to hide a haircut Hobbes gave him.

* As "Stupendous Man" he pictures himself as a superhero in disguise, wearing a mask and a cape made by his mother and narrating his own adventures. Stupendous Man almost always "suffers defeat" to his opponent. When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles, Calvin says all his battles are "moral victories." Stupendous Man's enemies include "Mom Lady" (Calvin's mom), "Annoying Girl" (Susie Derkins), "Crab Teacher" (Ms. Wormwood), and "Baby-Sitter Girl" (Rosalyn).

===Cardboard boxes===
[[File:Scientific Progress Goes Boink (Calvin and Hobbes).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Calvin duplicating himself using a cardboard box, as seen on the cover of ''Scientific Progress Goes "Boink"'']]
Over the years Calvin has had several adventures involving corrugated [[cardboard box]]es which he adapts for many different uses. In one strip, during which Calvin shows off his Transmogrifier, a device that transforms its user into any desired shape, Hobbes remarks, "It's amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days."<ref>[[The Essential Calvin and Hobbes]] p 229</ref> Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. In this way, a cardboard box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying [[Time travel|time machine]] and a duplicator. In addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a desk when he is attempting to sell things. Often, Calvin's merchandise is something that no one would want, such as "a swift kick in the butt" for one dollar,<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 172</ref>, or "frank appraisal of your looks" for fifty cents. In one strip, he sold "happiness" for ten cents, which was a water balloon in the face, revealing that Calvin meant ''his'' happiness.

}}
Calvinball is a game played by Calvin and Hobbes as a rebellion against organized team sports; according to Hobbes, "No sport is less organized than Calvinball!"<ref name="CC+H_b2_p268-273">[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 268<U+2013>273. Comics originally published 1990-04-16 to 1990-05-05.</ref> Although the first depicted game of Calvinball follows a storyline about Calvin joining the baseball team and his subsequent choice to quit, Calvinball games occur throughout the life of the strip.

The only hint at the true creation of the game comes from the last Calvinball strip, in which a game of football quickly changes into a game of Calvinball. Calvin remarks "sooner or later, all our games turn into Calvinball,"<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 3, p. 438. Comic originally published 1995-09-24.</ref> suggesting a similar scenario that directly led to the creation of the sport.  Calvin and Hobbes usually play by themselves, although in one storyline Rosalyn (Calvin's baby-sitter) plays in return for Calvin doing his homework, and plays very well after she realizes that the rules are made up on the spot.<ref name="CC+H_b3_p430-433">[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 3, pp. 430<U+2013>433. Comics originally published 1995-09-04 to 1995-09-16.</ref>

The only consistent rule states that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, p. 292. Comic originally published 1990-05-27.</ref> Scoring is also arbitrary, with Hobbes at times reporting scores of "Q to 12" and "oogy to boogy."<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 292, 336. Comics originally published 1990-05-27 and 1990-08-26.</ref> The only recognizable sports Calvinball resembles are the ones it emulates (i.e., a cross between croquet, polo, badminton, capture the flag, and volleyball.) Equipment includes a [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] (the eponymous "Calvinball"), a soccer ball, a [[croquet]] set, a [[badminton]] set, assorted flags, bags, signs, a [[hobby horse]], and enigmatic and never-pictured "time-fracture wickets". Other things appear as needed, such as a bucket of ice-cold water, a water balloon, and various songs and poetry.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 273, 292, 336, 429; vol 3, pp. 430<U+2013>433, 438. Comics originally published 1990-05-05, 1990-05-27, 1990-08-26, 1991-03-31, 1995-09-04 to 1995-09-16, and 1995-09-24.</ref> Players also wear masks resembling [[blindfold]]s with holes for the eyes. When Rosalyn asks Calvin the reason for the requirement, Calvin responds, "Sorry, no one's allowed to question the masks." <ref name="CC+H_b3_p430-433"/> When asked how to play Watterson states, "It's pretty simple: you make up the rules as you go."<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 129.</ref> Calvinball is a [[nomic]] or self-modifying game, a contest of wits and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill, in which Hobbes (and on one occasion, Rosalyn) usually outwits Calvin, who takes it in stride, in contrast to his otherwise bad sportsmanship.

===Wagon and sled===
Calvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a [[wagon]], [[sled]], or [[toboggan]], depending on the season, as a device to add some physical comedy to the strip and because, according to Watterson, "it's a lot more interesting ... than talking heads."<ref name="Tenth_p104">[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 104.</ref> While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip,<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, pp. 233, 325. Comics originally published 1990-01-07 and 1990-08-10.</ref> it also frequently serves as a counterpoint or visual metaphor while Calvin ponders the meaning of life, death, God, or a variety of other weighty subjects.<ref name="Tenth_p104"/><ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 1, pp. 26, 56, 217; vol. 2, pp. 120, 237, 267, 298, 443; vol 3, pp. 16, 170, 224, 326, 414. Comics originally published 1985-11-30, 1986-02-07, 1987-01-11, 1989-05-28, 1990-02-04, 1990-04-15, 1990-06-10, 1992-02-02, 1992-05-17, 1993-04-18, 1993-08-22, 1995-01-14, and 1995-07-30.</ref> Many of their rides end in spectacular crashes which leave them battered and broken, a fact which convinces Hobbes to sometimes hop off before a ride even begins.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 2, p. 373. Comic originally published 1990-12-01.</ref> In the final strip, Calvin and Hobbes depart on their toboggan to go exploring.<ref name="CC+H_final_strip"/> This theme is similar (perhaps even homage to) scenarios in Walt Kelley's [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]].

==Books==
{{Main|List of Calvin and Hobbes books}}
[[File:The Essential Calvin and Hobbes.png|thumb|right|The first ''Calvin and Hobbes'' treasury.]]
There are 18 ''Calvin and Hobbes'' books, published from 1987 to 2005. These include 11 collections, which form a complete archive of the newspaper strips, except for a single daily strip from November 28, 1985. (The collections ''do'' contain a strip for this date, but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers. The alternate strip, a joke about Hobbes taking a bath in the [[washing machine]], has circulated around the Internet.)<ref>[[wikia:calvinandhobbes:Alternate strip|Comparison of alternate strip from November 28, 1985]]</ref> Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics.

Watterson included some new material in the treasuries. In ''The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'', which includes cartoons from the collections ''Calvin and Hobbes'' and ''Something Under the Bed Is Drooling'', the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town. The scene is based on Watterson's home town of [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio]], and Calvin is holding the [[Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop]], an iconic candy and ice cream shop overlooking the town's namesake falls.<ref name="APWattersonPrivacy">{{cite news|url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html|title=Calvin and Hobbes Creator Keeps Privacy|last=Milicia|first=Joe|date=2005-10-22|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> Several of the treasuries incorporate additional poetry; ''The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes'' book features a set of poems, ranging from just a few lines to an entire page, that cover topics such as Calvin's mother's "hindsight" and exploring the woods. In ''The Essential Calvin and Hobbes'', Watterson presents a long poem explaining a night's battle against a monster from Calvin's perspective.

A complete collection of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strips, in three hardcover volumes totaling 1440 pages, was released on October 4, 2005, by Andrews McMeel Publishing. It includes color prints of the art used on paperback covers, the treasuries' extra illustrated stories and poems, and a new introduction by Bill Watterson. The alternate 1985 strip is still omitted, and two other strips (January 7, 1987, and November 25, 1988) have altered dialogue.<ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson2005|Watterson (2005)]], vol. 1, p. 215; vol. 2, p. 33.</ref><ref>[[#CITEREFWatterson1995|Watterson (1995)]], p. 43.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Watterson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Watterson |title=[[List of Calvin and Hobbes books|Weirdos from Another Planet!]] |year=1990 |publisher=Andrews and McMeel |location=Kansas City, MO |isbn=0-8362-1862-0 |page=125}}</ref>

To celebrate the release (which coincided with the strip's twentieth anniversary and the tenth anniversary of its absence from newspapers), ''Calvin and Hobbes'' reruns were made available to newspapers from Sunday, September 4, 2005, through Saturday, December 31, 2005,<ref name="thereturnn">{{cite web | url=http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/features/thereturn | title=Calvin and Hobbes - We're Back! | date=September 4, 2005 | publisher=Universal Press Syndicate | accessdate = 2006-03-17}}</ref><ref name="returning">{{cite news | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/returning.html | title=Calvin and Hobbes Returning to Newspapers <U+2014> Sort Of | publisher=Editor and Publisher | author=David Astor | date=May 20, 2005}}</ref> and Bill Watterson answered fifteen questions submitted by readers.<ref name="amiv">{{cite web | url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/interview.html | title=Fans From Around the World Interview Bill Watterson | publisher=Andrews McMeel | accessdate = 2006-03-16 | year=2005}}</ref>

Early books were printed in smaller format in black and white. These were later reproduced in twos in color in the "Treasuries" (''Essential'', ''Authoritative'', and ''Indispensable''), except for the contents of ''Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons''. Those Sunday strips were not reprinted in color until the ''Complete'' collection was finally published in 2005. Every book since ''Snow Goons'' has been printed in a larger format with Sundays in color and weekday and Saturday strips larger than they appeared in most newspapers.

Watterson claims he named the books the "''Essential'', ''Authoritative'', and ''Indispensable''" because, as he says in ''The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'', the books are "obviously none of these things".

An officially licensed children's textbook titled ''Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes'' was published in a single print-run in 1993.<ref name="twch" /> The book includes various ''Calvin and Hobbes'' strips together with lessons and questions to follow, such as, "What do you think the principal meant when he said they had ''quite a file'' on Calvin?" (108). The book is rare and increasingly sought by collectors.<ref name="twchinfo">{{cite web | url=http://teachingwithcalvinandhobbes.blogspot.com/ | title=Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes: Information Regarding The Book | accessdate = 2007-03-23}}</ref>

==Academic response==
In her book ''When Toys Come Alive'', [[Lois Rostow Kuznets]] says that Hobbes serves both as a figure of Calvin's childish fantasy life and as an outlet for the expression of [[libido|libidinous]] desires more associated with adults. Kuznets also looks at Calvin's other fantasies, suggesting that they are a second tier of fantasies utilized in places like school where [[transitional object]]s such as Hobbes would not be socially acceptable.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Kuznets  | first = Lois Rostow  | title = When Toys Come Alive  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 1994  | location =  }}</ref>  Another academic critic, Philip Sandifer, using the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories of [[Jacques Lacan]], identifies the strip's depiction of time within Calvin's real and imaginary worlds as a manifestation of the Lacanian concepts of the Imaginary, the Real, and the Symbolic.<ref>{{cite web | last=Sandifer | first=Philip | title=When Real Things Happen to Imaginary Tigers | url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v3_3/sandifer/ | publisher=University of Florida | work=Imagetext Interdisciplinary Comic Studies | accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref>

A collection of original Sunday strips was exhibited at [[Ohio State University]]'s Cartoon Research Library in 2001.  Watterson himself selected the strips and provided his own commentary for the exhibition catalog, which was published widely as ''Calvin and Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985-1995''.<ref name="Amazon-SundayPages">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.ca/Calvin-Hobbes-Sunday-Pages-1985-1995/dp/0740721356|title=Calvin and Hobbes Sunday Pages 1985-1995 (Paperback)|date=2001-06|work=(See product description for explanation by Lucy Caswell, curator of the exhibition) |publisher=Amazon.ca|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>

Academics and other intellectuals were interviewed for a Sept 9, 2009 [[BBC Radio 4]] half-hour documentary about the comic strip, narrated by [[Phill Jupitus]].<ref name="BBC-Calvin">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mr2fj|title=Calvin and Hobbes|last=Jupitus|first=Phill|date=2009-09-22|publisher=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref>
