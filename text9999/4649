== Plot synopsis ==

=== Setting ===
''Eldest'' begins three days after the events of the preceding novel, ''[[Eragon]]'', in the dwarf city of Tronjheim, inside of a hollowed mountain named [[Inheritance Cycle#Geography|Farthen D<U+00FB>r]]. Farthen D<U+00FB>r is in the southeastern part of [[Alaga<U+00EB>sia]], the fictional continent where the ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' takes place. Throughout the novel, the protagonists travel to many different places: Ellesm<U+00E9>ra, the elven capital city located in the forest [[Du Weldenvarden]], on the northern portion of Alaga<U+00EB>sia; Carvahall, a small town located on the northwestern part of Alaga<U+00EB>sia in Palancar Valley; and Aberon, the capital of Surda, located in the southern portion of Alaga<U+00EB>sia.

=== Characters ===
{{main|List of the Inheritance Cycle characters}}
The story is told in third-person through protagonists [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]], [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Major characters|Roran]], and [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Nasuada|Nasuada]]. Eragon is nearly always accompanied by his dragon [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Saphira|Saphira]]. Due to the multiple points-of-view, multiple stories take place concurrently, and the protagonist characters do not meet often. Several other characters return from ''[[Eragon]]'', including [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Major characters|Arya (the elf warrior, daughter of the elven queen)]], [[List of the Inheritance Cycle characters#Orik|Orik]],  [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Roran|Roran (Eragon's cousin)]] (who plays as a major protagonist), [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Ajihad|Ajihad (the leader of the Varden)]] (who dies and is replaced by Nasuada), and [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Angela|Angela (the herbalist)]].  Some new characters are introduced in ''Eldest'', such as [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Oromis|Oromis]] and the dragon [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Glaedr|Glaedr]]. [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Murtagh|Murtagh]] appears briefly as a minor protagonist but then reappears later as a primary antagonist with his dragon, [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Thorn|Thorn]]. [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Galbatorix|Galbatorix]] and the [[List of the Inheritance Cycle characters#The Ra'zac|Ra'zac]] also reprise their roles as primary antagonists.

=== Plot summary ===
''Eldest'' begins as [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Ajihad|Ajihad]], the leader of the rebel Varden force, is ambushed and killed, with [[Characters in the Inheritance Cycle#Murtagh|Murtagh]] gone while The Twins and Murtagh are assumed dead. At his funeral, Ajihad's daughter [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Nasuada|Nasuada]] is elected to command the Varden. The protagonists Eragon and Saphira then decide to travel to the forest [[Du Weldenvarden]] to become trained as a [[Dragon Rider (Inheritance Cycle)|Dragon Rider]] by the elves. The dwarf king, Hrothgar, decides to adopt Eragon to his clan, Durgrimst Ingeitum, and have his now foster brother, Orik, accompany him to the forest. Once there, Eragon meets [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Oromis|Oromis]], The Cripple Who Is Whole, and his Dragon [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Glaedr|Glaedr]], the only Dragon and Rider secretly alive besides Eragon, Saphira and [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Galbatorix|Galbatorix]] and his mentally ill, forcibly bonded dragon Shruikan. Oromis and Glaedr, however, are both crippled, and so cannot fight Galbatorix and must hide to avoid Galbatorix hunting them down. Eragon and Saphira are taught the use of logic, magic theory, scholarship, and combat, among other things.

Meanwhile, Eragon's cousin Roran, is planning to marry Katrina, daughter of Sloan the butcher. While the village is at peace, they are unexpectedly attacked by Galabatorix's soldiers and the Ra'zac, the strangers who had killed Roran's father, Garrow. The village metalsmith, Horst, equips his sons along with Roran with equipment. Roran takes a hammer and whacks the soldiers. The Ra'zac and most of the soldiers escape, saying that they want information for Roran. The entire village then sets up defenses, and during a second invasion, the Ra'zac escape again. One night, Roran wakes up to find Katrina being attacked by the Ra'zac, who sneaked into the house. Roran then takes off the cloth around the Ra'zac's face and sees that they are monsters, not humans. A Ra'zac bites Roran, leaving a serious injury, and leave with Katrina captured. While Roran is chasing them, Sloan, Katrina's father, betrays the village and joins the Ra'zac. The Ra'zac escape with their steeds, the Lethrblaka, who are originally their parents.

Meanwhile, Nasuada chooses to move the Varden from Tronjheim to Surda to mount an attack on the Empire. The Varden suffer financial troubles, however, until Nasuada learns that she can create an expensive lace with magic, and sell it at extremely low rates. One night when Nasuada is in her room, a character named Elva saves her from an assassination attempt. Elva is enchanted, and locates the assailant, who is killed after unwillingly surrendering information to Varden magicians about a subversive group based in Surda called the Black Hand, who is plotting to kill Nasuada. Nasuada later attends a meeting with key figures in Surda's government to discuss a potential upcoming battle against the Empire. They learn that the conflict is coming sooner than they initially suspected, and mobilize forces to attack, as well as sending for help from the dwarves.

In the meantime, Eragon continues his training, but is discouraged when the scar on his back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya for most of the book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaet<U+00ED> Bl<U+00F6>dhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of his poem, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.

Meanwhile, Roran is planning to rescue Katrina. He decides that the only solution is to join the Varden in Surda, and so convinces almost the entire village to travel there. The village reaches Narda, where they pay for barges to sail to Teirm. In Teirm, Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who tells him about Eragon and that he is a Dragon Rider now. Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden. Jeod decided to go with them and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing. The village is chased by a group of Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.

Meanwhile, Eragon arrived at the Varden's camp, who is under attack of an army of one hundred thousand of Galbatorix's soldiers. A group of Urgals join the Varden, and Eragon is able to repel the opposing army with help from the dwarves' reinforcements. Eventually, a Dragon Rider appears in favor of the Empire. The hostile Dragon Rider kills the dwarf king [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Hrothgar|Hrothgar]], and soon begins to fight with Eragon. The Dragon Rider is soon unmasked by Eragon and is revealed to be Murtagh, his old friend. Murtagh tells Eragon that he was kidnapped and forced into loyalty by Galbatorix after a dragon hatched for him, whom he named Thorn. Murtagh outmatches Eragon, but shows mercy due to their old friendship. Before leaving, Murtagh reveals that Eragon is his brother, and takes Eragon's sword as well. Ultimately, Galbatorix's army is forced to retreat due to heavy losses, after the arrival of the dwarves and the village of Carvahall and the departure of Murtagh and Thorn. Roran manages to defeat the Twins by bashing them in the heads with his hammer, thus enhancing his title of Roran Stronghammer. In the end, Eragon reunites with Roran and Eragon decides to help Roran rescue Katrina from the Ra'zac in Dras-Leona.

== Critical reaction ==
''Eldest'' received generally negative reviews, and it was met with criticism similar to ''Eragon'' for to its derivative nature. ''School Library Journal'' noted that ''Eldest'' lacked originality, but would still find reception among fans. It also acknowledged that themes of ''Eldest'' are based generally on the works of other writers.<ref name="Amazon">{{Cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/037582670X | title = Reviews of Eldest | work = Amazon.com | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> ''BookBrowse'' also criticized ''Eldest'', but said, as ''School Library Journal'' noted, that nothing the reviewers can say will stop some children from reading the book.<ref name="BookBrowse">{{Cite web | url = http://www.bookbrowse.com/reviews/index.cfm?book_number=1636 | title = BookBrowse reviews of Eldest | work = BookBrowse | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> ''Entertainment Weekly'' rated ''Eldest'' as one of the worst five books of 2005, calling it a "700-page drag."<ref name="Weekly">{{Cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1142746,00.html | title = Books: The 5 Worst | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate = 2007-09-23 | first=Jennifer | last=Reese | date=2005-12-22}}</ref> ''The Boston Globe'' gave a negative review for ''Eldest'', criticizing the very low points and for "drama that rises to a wet pop."<ref name="BookBrowse"/> ''The Christian Science Monitor'' gave ''Eldest'' a C+ grade. Similar to other reviews, it criticized the long plot and its similarities to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'', as well as the lack of humor. The review commented that [[Roran]], one of the secondary major characters, had the best part of the book.<ref name="Christian Science Monitor">{{Cite web | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0923/p15s01-bogn.html | title = Book Roundup | work = The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref> ''SFSignal'' also gave ''Eldest'' a poor review, giving it one out of five stars. The main reason of this was for its dull pace. The SFSignal review, like ''The Christian Science Monitor'', did say that [[Roran]] had the "strongest sequence" in the book.<ref name="SFSignal">{{Cite web | url = http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/003239.html | title = Review: Eldest | work = SFSignal | accessdate = 2007-09-23 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070716232848/http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/003239.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>

== Themes ==
Several [[Theme (literary)|themes]] in ''Eldest'' have been noted. A Barnes & Noble reviewer praised the honor, friendship, responsibility, and forgiveness in the book. The reviewer called these themes "age-transcendent".<ref name="Themes">{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780375826702&itm=6|title=Eldest (Inheritance Cycle #2)|work=Barnes & Noble.com|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> [[School Library Journal]] commented on how [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]] looked for a definition for good and evil.<ref name="Themes"/> A third review, while not identifying any specific themes, said the author was "layering his themes" to make the book more exciting.<ref name="Bookreporter.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews2/037582670X.asp|title=ELDEST: Inheritance, Book II|work=Bookreporter.com|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> Another review praised the story for the themes of power, family, and maturing.<ref name="Buy.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.buy.com/prod/eldest-inheritance-book-ii/q/loc/106/31192659.html|title=Eldest: Inheritance, Book II (Audio CD Unabridged)|work=Buy.com|accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> Paolini commented on the theme in ''Eldest'' of [[vegetarianism]]:<ref name="Trilogy">{{cite web|url=http://www.alagaesia.com/talktrilogy.html|title=Talking Trilogy with Christopher Paolini|work=Alagaesia.com|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref>
<blockquote>"One of my goals as an author is to explore various aspects of human nature. It's my job, then, to attempt to understand why people act, even if it differs from my own point of view or practice, and to present those reasons to the best of my ability. The actions and beliefs of my characters are not necessarily my own."</blockquote>

There are also themes of religion and atheism, the dwarves being highly religious, the elves being atheists, and Eragon, growing up without a religious background but a set of superstitions, wondering if there are higher powers.

== Literary style and genre ==
''Eldest'' falls in the [[genre]] of juvenile fiction<ref name="Random Genre">{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/audio/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307280725|title=Eldest |work=Random House|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> and [[fantasy]].<ref name="Common Sense">{{cite web|url= http://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/Eldest-Inheritance-Trilogy-Book.html| title=Eldest |work=Common Sense Media | accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> Reviews often commented on how ''Eldest'' borrowed from the fantasy genre.<ref name="Amazon"/> Other reviews criticized and praised the writing style of the author. ''Los Angeles Times'', while noting that the writing was more mature, criticized the novel for being inconsistent and having an archaic style. An ''Entertainment Weekly'' review was negative toward the story because it was slow-paced, while ''The Washington Post'' said ''Eldest'' needed to be shortened.<ref name="Powell's Book">{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?show=hardcover:sale:037582670x:14.70|title=Eldest (Inheritance Cycle #02) by Christopher Paolini|work=Powell's Books|accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref> A reviewer from ''The Boston Globe'' said:<ref name="BookBrowse"/>
<blockquote>"He is to English as a bad dog to a chainsaw: he worries it, and worries it, and devastation spreads around him."</blockquote>
On the other hand, Barnes & Noble called the writing style fluid<ref name="BookBrowse"/> and ''Children's Literature'' praised the story for being richly detailed. ''Kirkus Reviews'' compared the story to a patchwork of fantasy elements and characters, then concluded that it, despite being derivative, was exciting and held together well.<ref name="Powell's Book"/>

= Film adaptation =
Whether or not the book will be adapted to film remains a matter of speculation. When asked whether there would be a movie adaptation of ''Eldest'' at the premiere of ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', Christopher Paolini replied, "I think we'll know after opening weekend."<ref name="Interview">{{Cite web | url = http://media.shurtugal.com/movieviewer.php?type=rev&id=123099&play=fla | title = Interview with Christopher Paolini | work = Shurtugal.com | accessdate = 2006-12-25}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Many critics have considered the possibility of a sequel in their reviews of ''Eragon''. One [[critic]] said that [[20th Century Fox]]'s plans to adapt Eldest was "[[Jump the gun|jumping the gun]]" and that "they will have a tough time convincing anyone but the most die-hard fans to return for another helping."<ref name="TheMovieBoy">{{Cite web | url = http://themovieboy.com/reviews/e/06_eragon.htm | title = Eragon film review | work = TheMovieBoy | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref> Even some critics who gave the film positive reviews were skeptical towards the possibility of a sequel: "That the studio hopes to build a franchise on this, now that<U+2014>that is expecting way too much."<ref name="Hollywood">{{Cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodvideo.com/movies/movie.aspx?MID=142841 | title = Eragon films review | work = Hollywood Video | accessdate = 2007-07-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928084106/http://www.hollywoodvideo.com/movies/movie.aspx?MID=142841 |archivedate =2007-09-28}}</ref>

According to an interview with director [[Stefen Fangmeier]]:

{{cquote|I'm not quite sure what is currently going on. My own personal perspective is that until we sort of figure out what happens in the third book. Evidentially<!--sic-->, I asked Christopher... about that and he was not volunteering much of what was going to happen. I think it's very important to see where this ends up; how it's resolved. I think until you kind of have an understanding of what the third piece of that puzzle is, it's kind of hard to look at that second book, of course I read it, it's very much a transitional story element. I think one would be best off to write the third film first, and then, being happy with that, going back to the second one and doing all the set-up work that will pay off in the third. Then probably filming two and three together as they did with ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''; as one production."

That means, given the time frame, it might still be another year before there are actually are scripts for both films and these things can move ahead. I don't know if Fox is waiting to see the revenues the DVD will create. I think they were modestly happy with the worldwide box office."<ref name="Movieweb">{{Cite web | url = http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/39/18439.php | title = Interview with Stefan Fangmeier | work = Movieweb | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>}}

Fangmeier's comments were made in March 2007, before the October 2007 announcement that the trilogy was to be expanded into a four-book cycle.<ref name= "Inheritance Cycle">{{cite web |url= http://alagaesia.com/kvetha/paolini_announcement.pdf|title= Series will be expanded to include a fourth full-length novel|accessdate= 2007-10-31 |format= PDF}}</ref> As of 2013, there are no plans for ''Eldest'' being made into a movie.
