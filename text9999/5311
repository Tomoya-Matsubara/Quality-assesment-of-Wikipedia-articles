The '''Battle of Mah<U+00E9>''' took place on 19<U+2013>20 August 1801 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], in the Roads of [[Mah<U+00E9>, Seychelles]]. The Royal Navy frigate HMS ''Sybille'' under Captain [[Charles Adam]] captured the French frigate [[French frigate Chiffone (1800)|''Chiffonne'']] and two smaller vessels, under the command of Capitaine de Vaisseau Guieyesse.<ref name=USM1841>{{cite book|title=The United Service Magazine |date=1841|pages=208<U+2013>10|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kwEcAQAAIAAJ&dq=Chiffonne+++Sybille+mahe&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>

The [[French frigate Sibylle (1792)|HMS ''Sibylle'']] under Captain [[Charles Adam]], was dispatched from [[Trincomalee]] to the Seychelle Islands on the 28th July on an of inspection. The islands had been visited by Captain [[Henry Newcome (Royal Navy)|Henry Newcome]] who had entered into a pact with the inhabitants under [[Jean-Baptiste Queau de Quincy]] principally French from Mauritius to preserve complete neutrality.<ref name=USM1841/>

Early on the morning of the 19th August the ''Sybille'' arrived off [[Ste. Anne Island]] on which signals were observed to be flying and Adam ordered French colours to be hoisted on board the ''Sybille''. Having rounded a point of the island a large frigate was discovered at anchor in the Mahe Roads. The frigate was close in shore and was under repair having her [[foremast]] out with a schooner and a Ketch close by. The ''Sybille'' hove to clear for action and stood in shore with French colours still flying whilst meandering her way through a shallow channel.<ref name=USM1841/>

The frigate in shore which was the French 36 gun frigate ''Chiffonne'' commanded by Captain Pierre Guieysse. She had arrived along with the [[corvette]] ''La Fl<U+00EA>che'' after a cruise in the Indian Ocean hunting ships of the [[East India Company]]. ''Chiffonne'' was under repair with a new mast being fitted accompanied by a [[Ketch]] and a [[schooner]];  ''La Fl<U+00EA>che'' meanwhile had moved on. Four of the ''Chiffonne'''s twelve pounders had been landed and a battery constructed mounted on a plank platform defended by [[fascine]]s. A furnace was provided with a for [[Heated shot|heating shot]] in an advantageous position for the protection of the frigate and the two small vessels at anchor.<ref name=USM1841/>

==Action & Aftermath==
At 10 am ''Chiffonne'' fired a shot and hoisted her colours, as did the two smaller vessels which was taken no notice of by the ''Sybille'' who continued to thread her way through the channel. When the ''Sybille'' had approached within about 300 yards of the French frigate's [[larboard]] bow the Naval ensign was raised. ''Chiffonne'' seeing this immediately commenced firing and while the ''Sybille'' was bringing her [[broadside]] to bear on the Chiffonne at the distance of 200 yards, she was exposed to the fire of the French. The ''Sybille'' at about 10:30 opened her broadside following which a mutual cannonading with determination from both sides was commenced.<ref name=USM1841/>

A [[coxswain]] by the name of Duratt stationed aft on the [[quarter-deck]] pointed one of ''Sybilles'' [[carronade]]s at the French schooner, leveled the gun at her and fired with so correct an aim that the vessel almost immediately sunk.<ref name=USM1841/>

The firing only continued about a quarter of an hour when the ''Chiffonne'' [[Striking the colors|hauled down her colours]] and then cut her cables to drift upon a reef of rocks. A party of ''Sybilles'' men was sent to take possession of the frigate while a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] was sent with another party of [[Royal Marines]] to proceed with a land assault upon battery on shore which still continued firing and kept the French colours flying. As the men landed and began firing on the battery the French colours were hauled down and some of those that had landed on island from the beached frigate later surrendered.<ref name=LG15454/>

''Chiffonne'' had lost 23 men killed and 30 wounded while ''Sybille'' had lost two men killed and one wounded.<ref name=LG15454/> As well as the ''Chiffonne'' the prizes included the re floated schooner called the ''Sophie'' and the Ketch. ''Chiffone'' was brought into British service as HMS ''Chiffonne''.<ref name="Woodman">Woodman p 130</ref>

Quincy had to try to defend the ''Chiffonne'', Adam of the ''Sybille'' wanted to know why Quincy had interfered, in contravention of his capitulation terms. Quincy managed to talk his way out of the difficulty, and even persuaded Adam to agree to Seychelles' vessels flying a flag bearing the words "Seychelles Capitulation", allowing them to pass through the British blockade of Mauritius unmolested.<ref>Lionnet p 324-245</ref>

When Adams arrived in [[Chennai|Madras]] with his prize the insurance company there presented him with a sword worth [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], while the merchants of Calcutta later too presented him with a sword and a piece of plate.<ref>Conolly pp 2<U+2013>3</ref>

On 15 September 1801 another sea battle was fought off island; ''Chiffonne'''s consort ''La Fl<U+00EA>che'' was hunted down and sunk in a in a two day battle with the [[sloop]] [[HMS Victor (1798)|HMS Victor]].<ref name="Woodman"/>
