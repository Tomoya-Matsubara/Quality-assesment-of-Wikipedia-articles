'''Austin Zoo & Animal Sanctuary''' is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] rescue [[zoological park|zoo]] and [[animal sanctuary]] located at 10808 Rawhide Trail in southwestern [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]], [[Texas]], [[United States]], west of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

The mission of Austin Zoo and Animal Sanctuary is to assist animals in need through rescue, rehabilitation and education. Last year, over 175,000 people visited Austin Zoo & Animal Sanctuary.

==History==

Austin Zoo started out as a goat ranch. In 1990, it became the Good Day Ranch, housing animals in need. At that time, the animals were mostly domesticated and local animals including [[goat]]s, [[pig]]s, [[fallow deer]], [[donkey]]s, and [[pony|ponies]], with just a few exotic animals.  Gradually the number of exotic animals increased, and in 1994 the name was changed to Austin Zoo. In 2000, the zoo became a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.<ref name="impact"/> Today, the zoo and sanctuary is home to mostly exotic animals that were rescued from or unwanted by their owners, animals from other zoos and sanctuaries, and animals who were awarded protection through the judicial system. All of these animals have a forever home with Austin Zoo & Animal Sanctuary.

==Animals==

Austin Zoo currently has over 300 animals from over 100 different species,<ref name="zoo_main"/> including [[African lion]]s, [[Bengal tiger]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[jaguar]]s, three species of [[monkey]]s, [[black bear]]s, [[ring-tailed lemur]]s, and [[porcupines]].<ref name="real-austin"/> In 2009 the zoo became home to four wolf hybrids which had been abandoned during [[Hurricane Ike]] in [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season|2008]].<ref name="kfdm"/>

==Conservation breeding==

In 2010 the zoo received a pair of lions which were believed to be [[Barbary lion]]s  from a private owner. Because these lions are believed extinct in the wild, the zoo agreed to breed them and to provide DNA samples to the Barbary Lion Project. The family of lions now includes two cubs.<ref name="zoo_lions"/><ref name="rare_lions"/>
