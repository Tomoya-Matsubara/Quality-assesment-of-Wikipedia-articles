The '''National Hurricane Center''' ('''NHC'''), located at [[Florida International University]] in [[Miami, Florida]], is the division of the [[National Weather Service]] responsible for tracking and predicting weather systems within the tropics between the [[Prime Meridian]] and the [[140th meridian west]] poleward to the [[30th parallel north]] in the northeast [[Pacific ocean]] and the 31st parallel north in the northern [[Atlantic ocean]].  Its Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) routinely issues marine forecasts, in the form of graphics and high seas forecasts, for this area year round.

During the [[Atlantic hurricane season|Atlantic]] and northeast Pacific hurricane seasons, the Hurricane Specialists Unit issues routine tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans.  When [[tropical storm]] or hurricane conditions are expected within 36&nbsp;hours, the center issues the appropriate watches and warnings via the news media and [[NOAA Weather Radio]]. Although the NHC is an agency of the United States, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] has designated it as [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the [[North Atlantic]] and eastern [[Pacific]]. As such, the NHC is the central clearinghouse for all tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas, regardless of their effect on the US.  If the center loses power or becomes incapacitated in some manner, the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific ocean while the [[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]] backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north Atlantic ocean.

{{See also|History of Atlantic tropical cyclone warnings|Tropical cyclone naming}}
The first hurricane warning service was set up in the 1870's from [[Cuba]] with the work of Father Benito Vi<U+00F1>es.  After his passing, hurricane warning services were assumed by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Signal Corp]] and [[United States Weather Bureau]] over the next few decades, first based in [[Jamaica]] and [[Cuba]] before shifting to [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name="Simpson">{{cite journal|journal=Weather and Forecasting|pages=617<U+2013>620|title=Stepping Stones in the Evolution of a National Hurricane Policy|author=R.

This responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, and the concept of the [[Atlantic hurricane season]] was established in order to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year.  Hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/90/2334/266.1.extract|journal=Science|date=1939-09-22|accessdate=2012-04-19|title=Hurricane Warnings of the U.

In 1984, the NHC was separated from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami was no longer in a position above the hurricane center director.  By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former [[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center]] in San Francisco was decommissioned.  In 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew]] blew the [[WSR-57]] weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of Gables One Tower, then the location of the NHC's offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D [[NEXRAD]] system, installed near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.  In 1995, the NHC moved into a new hurricane resistant facility on the campus of [[Florida International University]], capable of withstanding 130&nbsp;mph (210&nbsp;km/h) winds.<ref name="NHC bunker">[http://www.ametsoc.org/amschaps/nov02news.html Ametsoc.org]</ref>  The current director of the National Hurricane Center is [[Bill Read]].

==Hurricane Specialists Unit==
The NHC's hurricane specialists are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms. The specialists work rotating eight-hour shifts from May through November, monitoring weather patterns in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific oceans. Whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms, they begin to issue advisories every six hours until the storm runs its course.  Public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnhcprod.shtml|title=NHC Text Product Descriptions|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2011-09-27|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>  The specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected. They forecast and recommend watches and warnings.  Each specialist signs forecasts and advisories with their last name, sometimes issuing joint statements with other NHC staff members.

During the hurricane season, the HSU routinely issues their Tropical Weather Outlook product, which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones.  If systems occur outside the defined hurricane season, special Tropical Weather Outlooks will be issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo_atl.shtml|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2011|accessdate=2011-07-09|title=Atlantic Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook}}</ref>  Routine coordination occurs at 1700 UTC each day between the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center and National Hurricane Center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics, and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future.<ref>[[United States Department of Commerce]] (2006). [http://www.weather.gov/om/assessments/pdfs/Katrina.pdf Service Assessment: Hurricane Katrina, August 23-31, 2005.] Retrieved on 2008-09-03.</ref>  Possible tropical cyclones are depicted with a closed isobar, while systems with less certainty to develop are depicted as "spot lows" with no isobar surrounding them.

Outside of the hurricane season, the specialists concentrate on public education efforts.<ref>Tropical Prediction Center.

==Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch==
[[Image:NHC TAFB.jpg|center|thumb|A panoramic view of TAFB's operations at the NHC|805px]]
<br clear="all" />
The '''Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch''' ('''TAFB''', formerly the '''Tropical Satellite Analysis and Forecast unit''') is a part of the National Hurricane Center in [[Miami, Florida]]. The TAFB is responsible for [[high seas]] analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Unlike the Hurricane Specialists Unit (HSU), TAFB is staffed full-time around the year. Other responsibilities of the TAFB include satellite-derived [[tropical cyclone]] position and [[Dvorak technique|intensity]] estimates, [[NEXRAD|WSR-88D radar]] fixes for tropical cyclones, tropical cyclone forecast support, media support, and general operational support.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/abouttafb.shtml Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch]</ref>

==Technology and Science Branch==
The Technology & Science Branch (TSB), formerly known as TDAU, develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities.   TSB created and continues development of the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting (ATCF) system, used to incorporate various data and model outputs, create and update [[HURDAT]], and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts. The TSB provides support for NHC computer and communications systems including its website.  TSB maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions.  The [[storm surge|Storm Surge]] Unit, which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones, is part of this branch.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutintro.shtml|title=About the National Hurricane Center|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2012-04-20|date=2011-10-06}}</ref>

==CARCAH==
The Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) unit is a remote operating location of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Hurricane Hunters).  CARCAH's mission is to coordinate all tropical cyclone operational reconnaissance requirements at NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center for the North Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the North Pacific east of the International Date Line in accordance with the National Hurricane Operations Plan.  During the winter, CARCAH coordinates the Atlantic and Pacific winter storm requirements in support of the National Winter Storms Operations Plan.  Missions are flown in advance of the high-impact weather events forecasted to affect the U.S., such as heavy snowfall,<ref name="about"/> and at times when there is significant uncertainty within/between [[numerical weather prediction]] output.

==HLT==
The Hurricane Liason Team (HLT) supports hurricane response through information exchange between the NHC, the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), and the emergency management community.  The HLT is composed of federal, state, and local emergency managers, as well as NWS meteorologists and hydrologists, who maintain open lines of communication about the progress and threat level of the storm with appropriate Federal, state, and local officials.  The team establishes and facilitates video and/or teleconferences with the NHC, FEMA and other Federal agencies, state Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC), Storm Prediction Center (SPC), and River Forecast Centers (RFCs).<ref name="about"/>  During significant landfalling hurricanes, the [[President of the United States]] as well as affected city [[Mayoralty in the United States|mayor]]s and state [[Governor (United States)|governor]]s join the daily briefing call, which occurs at noon [[Eastern Daylight Time]].

==Research==
As part of their annual tropical cyclone activity, the agency issues a tropical cyclone report on every tropical cyclone in the [[Atlantic]] and [[Eastern Pacific]] Ocean basins, which are available since 1958 and 1988, respectively. The report summarizes the synoptic history, meteorological statistics, casualties and damages, and the post-analysis best track of a storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=NOAA Coastal Services Center|title=Historical Hurricane Tracks|year=|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2008-11-03|url=http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/reports.jsp}}</ref> The reports were formally known as Preliminary Reports up until 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=2008 Atlantic hurricane season|year=2008|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2008-11-19|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2008atlan.shtml}}</ref>

The agency maintains archives and climatological statistics on Atlantic and Pacific hurricane history, including annual reports on every tropical cyclone, a complete set of tropical cyclone advisories, digitized copies of related materials on older storms, season summaries published as the [[Monthly Weather Review]], and [[HURDAT]], which is the official tropical cyclone database.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center staff|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2011-05-10|title=NHC Archive of Hurricane Seasons|accessdate=2011-07-03||url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastall.shtml}}</ref>
