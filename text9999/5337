The '''Country Alliance''' is a minor political party in the state of [[Victoria, Australia| Victoria]], [[Australia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/parties.html#current
 website|title=Victorian Electoral Commission: Currently registered parties|accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref>. It was founded in early [[2004]] by four rural Victorians concerned with the policies of the existing parties.  It contested its first election at the [[Victorian state election, 2006|2006 Victorian State Election]]. It was officially registered on [[15 August]] [[2005]], and now has over 1000 members.

The party was launched in August 2005, after which [[Russell Bate]], one of the party founders, stated that "The thing that first caused us to gather around the kitchen table and say, 'We'd better do something', was the prospect of the Greens holding the balance of power. At this stage that's the saga we're trying to avoid." [http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/vic/content/2005/s1441956.htm]

It purposely has few policies, as its elected representatives were supposed to independently act in their constituents interests. It is, however, pro-forrestry, pro-shooting sports, and is supportive of certain commercial activities in ecologically sensitive areas, upon were a demonstration of sustainability can be maintained. It also opposed the full sale of [[Telstra]] which now sees rural Victorians with little or no telecomunications, and has advocated for the decentralisation of government bureaucracies{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

The party is supported by the [[Australian Motorcycle Trail Riders Association]] and [[Combined Firearms Council of Victoria]]. It was founded by four people; among them Mansfield councillor [[Russell Bate]]. Others say it has declared its principles to be similar to the [[National Party of Australia]], [[Outdoor Recreation Party]], [[The Fishing Party|Fishing Party]] and the [[Family First Party]]. It also had the in-principle support of moderate conservative independent MLAs [[Craig Ingram]] and [[Russell Savage]].

In the 2006 Victorian election the party contested 3 regional upper regions (out of a total of 8 regions), but did not contest any lower house seats. In the 3 regions it contested, the CA received just over 2% of the vote in Northern Victoria: less in the Western and Eastern Victoria Regions.  However its preferences in Western Victoria were critical in supporting the DLP's Peter Kavanagh who went on to pick up ALP preferences ahead of the Greens' Marcus Ward, and ultimately the fifth seat in that region. 

As a consequence of not achieving a 4% primary vote, the Victorian Electoral Commission was required to review the party's membership list, which involved a postal audit of its members. The party achieved the required 500 returns in just two weeks despite the 2 day deliveries in country areas both ways and Easter when postal services are not provided.

The party's executive reconvened in Bendigo on 5 May 2007 and held its first AGM on 21 July 2007. It now has a fully elected executive.
