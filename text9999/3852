He had co-written the track with [[Mani Ratnam]] because of immediate filming requirements. Rahman recalled that while writing Mental Manadhil, both he and Ratnam wanted an interesting invention of a new words or phrases for the song. During their jamming sessions - Rahman was saying 'Laka Laka' to rhyme with 'Mana Mana... Manadhil...' Ratnam said 'mental' and thus they coined 'mental' and 'manadhil' together and that thus the track was framed.<ref>{{Cite web|title = No one can be the next anybody: AR Rahman - The Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/music/No-one-can-be-the-next-anybody-AR-Rahman/articleshow/46805432.cms|accessdate = 2015-04-05|last=Ravi|first=Nandita|publisher = The Times of India|publication-place = Chennai}}</ref>

He went on to add, "This album is ample proof that the Mani Ratnam-A.R.Rahman-Vairamuthu combination is still the best in the business. The musical assortment that is ''Oh Kadhal Kanmani'' is delicious to the ear!"<ref>{{Cite news|title = Oh Kadhal Kanmani: Classical yet cool|url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/article7066324.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = April 4, 2015|access-date = 2015-04-05|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN|first = Srinivasa|last = Ramanujam}}</ref> NIvedita Mishra for ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' showed wonder, "How A.R.

He felt that the though song promos bore resemblances to ''[[Alaipayuthey]]'' (2000) but the music is different. Hed added, "Mani Ratnam still does manage to turn [[A. R.

The inventiveness here may not go down well in every case, but this will still remain a brilliant soundtrack."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicaloud.com/2015/04/03/o-kadhal-kanmani-music-review-tamil-movie-soundtrack/|title = O Kadhal Kanmani <U+2013> Music Review (Tamil Movie Soundtrack)|date = 5 April 2015|accessdate = 5 April 2015|website = |publisher = MusicAloud|last = |first = }}</ref> ''[[Indo-Asian News Service]]'' summarized, "Some live up to the set expectations, and then there are exceptional few who always exceed the norms, to create staggering benchmarks.
