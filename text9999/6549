'''''Venni Vetti Vecci''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Ja Rule]], released through [[The Inc. Records|Murder Inc. Records]]. The album title alludes to the Latin phrase "[[veni, vidi, vici]]", meaning "I came, I saw, I conquered". The album was also the first release on [[Irv Gotti]]'s Murder Inc. Records imprint. Before the end of 1999, the album had been certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). This album, much like [[DMX (rapper)|DMX's]], ''[[It's Dark and Hell Is Hot]],'' was a shift from [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]], [[Mase]], and [[Bad Boy Records]]' "shiny suit era".

==Background and conception==
Ja Rule was first featured on [[Mic Geronimo]]'s "Time to Build" in 1995. Shortly after, he formed a group called Cash Money Click with his friends. The group was signed to [[TVT Records]] and recorded two albums, releasing one [[single (music)|single]] before being dropped from the [[record label]]. Ja Rule called it a "bullshit deal" as TVT withheld the publishing royalties of the recorded material. While working as an executive for [[Def Jam Recordings]], record producer [[Irv Gotti]] was hired as [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] and convinced Ja Rule to sign onto the label.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ogg|first=Alex|title=The Men Behind Def Jam: The Radical Rise of Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin|publisher=[[Music Sales Group#Omnibus Press|Omnibus Press]]|year=2002|page=227|isbn=0711988730}}</ref>

[[Russell Simmons]], the Def Jam founder, CEO, and mentor to Gotti then decided to give Gotti the label he had wanted for so long. In 1998, [[The Inc. Records|Murder Inc. Records]] was founded. To promote and market Ja Rule, he placed him on songs with [[Jay-Z]], [[LL Cool J]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Cash Money Records]], and [[Fat Joe]]. Due to Ja Rule's exceptional performances on these songs, Def Jam gave his album a release date.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The album title, ''Venni Vetti Vecci'', refers to the Latin phrase "[[veni, vidi, vici]]", which means "I came, I saw, I conquered".<ref>{{cite web|last=Farber|first=Jim|date=June 21, 1999|title=Ja Rule, The Conqueror, Drug Dealer Turned Rapper Has Got a Lot to 'Holla' About|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/06/21/1999-06-21_ja_rule__the_conqueror__drug.html|work=[[Daily News (New York){{!}}New York Daily News]]|accessdate=May 13, 2010}}</ref>

==Artwork==
The [[album cover]] of ''Venni Vetti Vecci'' features Ja Rule with his head turned upward, eyes closed and hands clasped together, standing in front of a white statue of [[Jesus]]. The cover alludes to the [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|biblical verses]] [[John 3:16]] and John 3:18, signifying "the father so feared the world that he left his only begotten son, in order to show that pain is love".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Brian K.|coauthors=Felder, Cain Hope; Martin, Clarice Jannette|title=True to Our Native Land: An African American New Testament Commentary|publisher=[[Augsburg Fortress|Fortress Press]]|year=2007|page=190|isbn=0800634217}}</ref>

Upon its release, ''Venni Vetti Vecci'' received generally mixed reviews. Ja Rule received several comparisons to fellow rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]].<ref name="RS"/> Writing for ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine, Shaheem Reid felt that the majority of the album was "hampered by colorless production", stating that Ja Rule "desperately needs tighter tracks to compliment his MC skills".<ref name="Vibe"/>

''Venni Vetti Vecci'' debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. selling 184,000 copies in its first week.<ref>{{cite web|date=June 9, 1999|title=Backstreet Boys Hold Off Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez on Chart|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1425217/19990609/backstreet_boys.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=May 13, 2010}}</ref> The album was certified [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=Venni,%20Vetti,%20Vecci&sort=Artist&perPage=25|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=May 13, 2010}}</ref> As of November 2002, the album sold over two million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2002|title=Billboard|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Business Media]]|volume=114|issue=45|pages=182|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OQ0EAAAAMBAJ}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
Ja Rule became one of the biggest hip hop stars, along with Jay-Z and DMX. Their albums, ''[[Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life]]'', ''[[It's Dark and Hell Is Hot]]'', and ''Venni Vetti Vecci'', all gained notoriety and multi-platinum sales. Because of these albums, Ja Rule was able to tour with these artists as they formed a group entitled, [[Murder Inc. (rap group)|Murder Inc.]], who fittingly signed to Murder Inc./Def Jam. He would be an opening act for Jay-Z and DMX on the 1998 Hard Knock Life Tour along with [[Memphis Bleek]]. The success of the album led to the credibility of [[Irv Gotti]] as a producer. The album, produced by Gotti was also overseen by Chris Lighty and [[Violator Management]], ironically one of the companies that Ja Rule now has issues with.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
