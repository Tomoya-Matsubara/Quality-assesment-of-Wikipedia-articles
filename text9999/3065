'''Alberto Radicati''', [[Count]] of [[Passerano]] (1698-1737) was an 18th century historian, philosopher and [[free-thinker]]. He was the reputed author of the [[1732]] work ''A Philosophical Dissertation upon Death, Composed for the Consolation of the Unhappy by a Friend of Truth'', published in [[London]]. This work created a scandal and led to the arrest of Radicati and his translator.<ref>Sylvia Berti, 'Unmasking the Truth: the theme of imposture in early modern European culture, 1660-1730', in James E. Force, David S. Katz (eds.) ''Everything connects: in conference with Richard H. Popkin: essays in his honor'', 1999, p.34</ref> The ''Dissertation upon Death'' is referenced by [[George Berkeley]] in his [[1733]] ''[[Theory of Vision Vindicated]]'', section 5. There Radicati's work is used as an example of a free-thinker explicitly adopting the radical views attributed to the free-thinkers by Berkeley in his [[1732]] dialogue ''[[Alciphron (book)|Alciphron]]'', and so to defend Berkeley against the charge of attacking a [[Strawman fallacy|strawman]].
