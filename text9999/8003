'''Magazine Street''' is a major thoroughfare in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].  Like [[Tchoupitoulas Street]], [[St. Charles Avenue]], and [[Claiborne Avenue]], it follows the course of the [[Mississippi River]].

==Description==
The upper end of the street begins at Leake Avenue, a part of [[Routing of the Great River Road|River Road]], where it turns away from the river in the Carrollton riverbend. The street follows the length of the crescent through [[Uptown New Orleans|Uptown]].  When the street reaches [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], it becomes [[Decatur Street, New Orleans|Decatur Street]].

In the [[Lower Garden District, New Orleans|Lower Garden District]], Magazine Street becomes one-way in the upriver direction; downriver traffic forks to join Camp Street, the next street away from the river.  The two streets continue a block apart through the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District]] to Canal Street.  Camp Street becomes Chartres Street in the French Quarter.

Near the upper end, the street runs between [[Audubon Park, New Orleans|Audubon Park]] and the [[Audubon Zoo]]. Most of the street is a mix of residential and commercial buildings, generally older houses from the later nineteenth century and similarly aged commercial stretches consisting of antique shops, clothing boutiques, restaurants, and bars.

Like many New Orleans streets, Magazine is particularly narrow along the two-way section despite being an [[New Orleans Regional Transit Authority|RTA bus route]].
