==Themes and recording==

Singer [[Gruff Rhys]] has described "Ysbeidiau Heulog" as "throwaway pop ... old time pop music", likening the song to the work of [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] and going on to claim that it is a tribute to late 60s pop bands such as [[The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band]] and [[Os Mutantes]].<ref name=BBC /> Rhys has stated that his lyrics are about "looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment" and that "If there's any song that doesn't sum up [Mwng] it's ['Ysbeidiau Heulog']!"<ref name=BBC /> The track was recorded in 2000 at Famous Studios, [[Cardiff]] and was [[Audio engineering|engineered]] by Greg Haver. [[Overdubbing|Overdubs]] were added at Ofn studios, Llanfaelog, [[Wales]] with the help of [[Gorwel Owen]] who also [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the song at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals.<ref name=Linernotes1>{{cite album-notes|title=Mwng|albumlink=Mwng|bandname=[[Super Furry Animals]]|year=2000|notestitle=|url=|first=|last=|page=[1]|format=CD booklet|publisher=[[Placid Casual]]|publisherid=|location=[[Cardiff]]|mbid=718ac535-b7ed-4c5d-bb5c-1b04ef8b23bf}}</ref> [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] "Charge" was recorded for an episode of [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''The [[John Peel]] Show'', which aired on 1 March 2000.<ref name=Linernotes2>{{cite album-notes|title=Ysbeidiau Heulog|albumlink=Ysbeidiau Heulog|bandname=[[Super Furry Animals]]|year=2000|notestitle=|url=|first=|last=|page=[1]|format=7" single sleeve|publisher=[[Placid Casual]]|publisherid=|location=[[Cardiff]]|mbid=92f27c66-6d68-4afa-b966-4218c3bc1a13}}</ref> The track was produced for the BBC by Simon Askew and engineered by Nick Fountain.<ref name=Linernotes2 />

"Ysbeidiau Heulog" is 2 minutes 51 seconds long and is in the key of [[B major]].<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Mwng|work=[[Allmusic]]|date=2000?|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:byfozfh1ehpk|accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref><ref name=Tabbook>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Super Furry Animals Songbook|publisher=Wise Publications|location=London|date=c2005|pages=32<U+2013>33|isbn=0711938881}}</ref> The track begins with an [[Introduction (music)|intro]] with a [[lead guitar]] melody, which plays twice, accompanied by [[drum kit|drums]], [[bass guitar|bass]], [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[rhythm guitar]] and [[saxophone]]. The first verse begins on 14 seconds with [[Gruff Rhys]] singing the lines "Fe gawsom ni, ysbeidiau heulog, ysbeidiau heulog" with a [[vocoder]] being used on the second "ysbeidiau heulog".<ref name=Tabbook /> This entire phrase is then repeated, with Rhys accompanied by [[Vocal harmony|harmony backing vocals]]. Throughout this first part of the verse the only instrumentation is a distorted bass guitar and drums. The second half of the verse begins at 28 seconds with rhythm guitar, playing the [[chord (music)|chords]] B, B, A and E twice with little [[sustain]], joining the drums and bass, which is no longer distorted.<ref name=Tabbook /> The track [[Break (music)|breaks down]] for the first chorus with Rhys singing "ysbeidiau heulog" four times backed by harmony vocals and occasional [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] noises with the band rejoining on the last "heulog", the rhythm guitar playing an A chord on each of the word's two [[syllable]]s which are emphasised by [[cymbal]] crashes. After a drum [[Fill (music)|fill]] an instrumental passage begins at 53 seconds. This follows the same arrangement as the intro although the lead guitar plays a melody line just once during the second half of the section, simply [[Audio feedback|feedingback]] for the first half. The second verse starts at 1 minute 8 seconds leading into the second chorus which this time features drums fills and rhythm guitar alongside Rhy's vocals. A short bridge plays at the end of the chorus with Rhys singing "Oedd ein cariad ni, heulog tan ddaeth glaw yn llif".<ref name=Tabbook /> Instrumentation is sparse with a guitar, featuring [[flanging]], playing several [[Lick (music)|licks]] alongside bass and drums, which are heavily affected by flanging. The bridge leads into the third and last chorus, which follows the arrangement of the second chorus although this time the drums feature flanging. The track ends with an instrumental [[outro]] similar to the intro. The outro begins at 2 minutes 16 seconds and features a second lead guitar with a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect playing licks alongside the main lead guitar and saxophone. After the guitar melody has played twice the main lead guitar stops playing and the track begins to [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade out]].

==Critical response==

"Ysbeidiau Heulog" received a generally positive response from critics. [[Pitchfork Media]] called the song the best track on parent album ''[[Mwng]]'' and described it as a "decidedly retro number that combines the swingin' sounds of the '60s with some high-tech vocal effects".<ref name=Pitchfork>{{cite web|last=LeMay|first=Matt|title=Mwng|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2000-06-20|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7601-mwng/|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> In a 2006 feature on the Super Furry Animals' back catalogue Incendiary Magazine called the track a "clever slice of pop".<ref name=Incendiary>{{cite web|last=Waterson|first=James|title=The Back Catalogue of Super Furry Animals|work=Incendiary Magazine|date=2006-04-03|url=http://www.incendiarymag.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=898|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> In a play on words on the track's meaning in English, [[Drowned in Sound]] stated that "Ysbeidiau Heulog" was ''Mwng's'' "sunny interval" and wouldn't feel out of place on 1999's ''[[Guerrilla (album)|Guerrilla]]''.<ref name=DiS>{{cite web|last=Ansell|first=Rachelle|title= Super Furry Animals: Mwng |work=[[Drowned in Sound]]|date=2000-05-15|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/2407/reviews/16|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref> Both the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' likened the track to the work of [[Roxy Music]] with the former calling it "happily woozy" and the latter claiming it is a "spunky, sax-spiked bop".<ref name=NME>{{Citation|last=Thomson|first=Neil|author-link=|title=Super Furry Animals <U+2013> London King's Cross Scala|journal=[[NME]]|volume=|pages=32|date=6 May 2000|year=2000}}</ref><ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web|last=Walters|first=Barry|title=Mwng|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2000-08-17|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/222436/mwng|accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref> The ''[[NME]]'' also placed the track at number 33 in their [[NME single of the year]] list for 2000.<ref name=rocklist>{{cite web | url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/2000.html#Singles|title=NME 2000 Lists|accessdate=2008-08-04| publisher=RockListMusic}}</ref> [[Yahoo!
