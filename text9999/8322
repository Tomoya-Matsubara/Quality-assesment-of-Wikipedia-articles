'''Adelasia''' (1207<U+2013>1259), eldest child of [[Marianus II of Torres|Marianus II of Logudoro]] by Agnes of Massa, daughter of [[William I of Cagliari]], and successor of her brother, [[Barisone III of Torres|Barisone III]], in 1236, was the [[Giudice of Logudoro|Judge of Logudoro]] from 1236 and [[Giudice of Gallura|Judge of Gallura]] from 1238. 

By a pact signed between her father, who had interests in [[Giudicato of Gallura|Gallura]], and Gallurese judge, the [[Pisa]]n [[Lamberto Visconti]] in November 1218, Adelasia first married the heir of Gallura, Lamberto's son [[Ubaldo of Gallura|Ubaldo II]] in 1219. [[Pope Honorius III]], enemy of the Pisans, immediately sent his chaplain Bartolomeo to annul the marriage, but he failed and the pact between Pisa and Logudoro stood. 

Ubaldo inherited the [[Giudicato of Gallura]] in 1225. Marianus died in 1232 and, by his will, was succeeded by his son Barisone III. Upon Barisone's death (1236) without heirs, also as stipulated by Marianus' will, the Logudorese magnates elected one of his daughters, Adelasia or Benedetta, to inherit. They unanimously acclaimed Adelasia, whose husband could well uphold her right. So they in turn elected him judge as well. In 1237, [[Pope Gregory IX]] sent his chaplain Alexander to Torres to receive recognition from Adelasia of papal suzerainty over Logudoro, as well as the lands she inherited from her grandfather William of Cagliari, in Pisa, [[Massa]], and [[Corsica]]. At the palace of [[Ardara]], in the presence of the [[Camaldolese]] abbot and monks of [[S. Trinit<U+00E0> di Saccargia]], she made the oath of vassalage and Ubaldo affirmed it, giving over the castle of [[Monte Acuto]] to the [[bishop of Ampurias]] as a guarantee of his good faith. Ubaldo did not, however, recognise any authority over Gallura other than the ancient authority of the [[Archdiocese of Pisa|Pisan archdiocese]]. 

By Ubaldo's will, drawn up in January 1237 at [[Silki]], Gallura was to be inherited by his cousin [[John of Gallura|John Visconti]]. [[Peter II of Arborea]] became Adelasia's protector. She remarried quickly to [[Guelfo dei Porcari]], a person devoted to the Holy See. He did not live long after, though. At that time, the [[Doria]] family of [[Genoa]], Pisa's main rival, convinced the [[Emperor Frederick II]] to marry his bastard son [[Enzio of Sardinia|Enzo]] to Adelasia and create a [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. Enzo arrived from [[Cremona]] in October the same year as Ubaldo's death and the two were married and titled King and Queen of Sardinia. Enzo left for the peninsula in July 1239 and never returned, being taken prisoner by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]], an imprisonment which was to prove lifelong. In 1245 or 1246, the marriage was annulled. 

After this date, Adelasia, saddened and tired of active government and retired to her castle of [[Goceano]]. She died in 1259, without heirs, and her territory was divided amongst the Doria, [[Malaspina]], and [[Spinola]] families, who all held it from Genoa. The neighbourging [[Giudicato of Arborea]] succeeded in taking some land. [[Sassari]] expelled its Pisan governor with the support of the Doria, refortified its defences, and adopted a republican model of government in alliance with Genoa, which sent an annual ''[[podest<U+00E0>]]''.
