==Career==
Kelly Richey's first instrument was the [[piano]]. Her second instrument was a [[drum kit]] that her neighbor let her take home. After a couple of months of playing drums in her bedroom, her father offered to buy her anything she wanted.  In place of the drums she was introduced to the [[guitar]] as a teenager and instantly fell in love with the instrument.  With the guitar strapped around her body, Kelly practiced everywhere she went- church, school, and the kitchen table.

Kelly Richey joined the [[Arista Records]] group, Stealin' Horses in 1986.  Through playing various styles of music and getting in touch with her gospel roots, Kelly realized that her true passion was the [[blues]].  In 1990, she formed The Kelly Richey Band (KRB), featuring Kelly as a lead [[blues]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[guitarist]] and vocalist.  KRB has become both a national and international touring band and is backed by [[David Clawson]] on drums and [[Jimmy Valdez]] on bass.
