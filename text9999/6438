'''Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec''' [<U+00E4>Nr<U+0113>' du t'''OO'''l'''OO'''z' l<U+014D>trek']  ([[November 24]], [[1864]] &ndash; [[September 9]], [[1901]]) was a [[France|French]] [[painter]], [[printmaker]], [[draftsman]], and illustrator, whose immersion in the decadent and theatrical life of [[fin de si<U+00E8>cle]] [[Paris]] yielded an ''oeuvre'' of provocative images of modern life.

==Biography==
===Youth===
'''Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa''' was born in [[Albi]], [[Tarn]] in the [[Midi-Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es]] Region of [[France]], the firstborn child of [[Count|Comte]] Alphonse and [[Countess|Comtesse]] Ad<U+00E8>le de Toulouse-Lautrec. An aristocratic family that had recently fallen on hard times, the Toulouse-Lautrecs were still feeling the effects of the inbreeding of past generations; the Comte and Comtesse were first cousins, and Henri suffered from a number of congenital health conditions attributed to this tradition of [[intermarriage]] (see below). A younger brother was born to the family on [[August 28]], [[1867]], but died the following year. 

====Disfiguration====
At ages 13 and 14, Henri fractured his left and right [[Femur|thigh bone]]s, respectively. The breaks did not heal properly (modern physicians attribute this to an unknown [[genetic disorder]] along the lines of [[osteoporosis]] or [[osteogenesis imperfecta]]; others speak of [[rachitism]] aggravated with praecox virilism), and his legs ceased to grow, so that as an adult he was only 1.52 m/5 ft tall, having developed an adult-sized torso but retained his child-sized legs (0.70 m/27.5 in long). On the other hand, he had [[hypertrophy|hypertrophied]] genitals as some of his photos prove.

Physically unable to participate in most of the activities typically enjoyed by men his age, Toulouse-Lautrec immersed himself in his art. He became an important [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter, [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] illustrator, and [[lithographer]] and recorded in his works many details of the late-[[19th century]] [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle in Paris. Toulouse-Lautrec also contributed a number of illustrations to the magazine ''[[Le Rire]]'' during the mid-[[1890]]s.

===Paris===
He was declared to be "the soul of [[Montmartre]]", the Parisian quarter where he made his home. He often portrayed life at the [[Moulin Rouge]] and other Montmartre and Parisian [[cabaret]] and theaters, and, particularly, in the [[brothel]]s that he frequented avidly (alledgedly, he contracted [[syphilis]] from Rosa la Rouge, who lived in a brothel). He lived there for long periods among the women that adopted him wholeheartedly and made him their confidant and the witness of their most intimate acts that inspired the lesbian scenes of many of his drawings and paintings. He painted singer [[Yvette Guilbert]], Louise Weber, known as the outrageous [[La Goulue]], a dancer who created the "[[Can-can|French Can-Can]]", and dancer Jane Avril.

Toulouse-Lautrec gave painting lessons to [[Suzanne Valadon]], one of his models (and, by all accounts, probably his mistress as well). 

An [[alcoholic]] for most of his adult life, he was placed in a [[Psychiatric hospital|sanatorium]]<!--sanatorium is the correct spelling in English--> shortly before his death. He died from complications due to alcoholism and syphilis just before his 37th birthday, at the family estate in [[Malrom<U+00E9>]]; he is buried in [[Verdelais]], [[Gironde]], a few kilometres from his birthplace. His last words reportedly were "Le vieux con!" ("Old fool"), when he saw his father trying to kill a fly in the room.

===Tremblement de Terre===

The invention of the Tremblement de Terre, [[Earthquake (cocktail)]] is attributed to Toulouse-Lautrec, a potent mixture containing four parts  [[Absinthe]], two parts [[Red Wine]], and a dash of [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]].

==Legacy==
After his death, his mother, the Comtesse Ad<U+00E8>le Toulouse-Lautrec, and Maurice Joyant, his art dealer, promoted his art. His mother contributed funds for a museum to be built in Albi, his birthplace, to house his works. As of [[2005]], his paintings had sold for as much as $14.5 million.

== Depiction in media ==
*''Lautrec'' is a biographical movie directed by [[Roger Planchon]] and was released in [[1998]] [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123952/].
*He is portrayed by [[John Leguizamo]] in the film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and by [[Jose Ferrer]] in the [[John Huston]] classic ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (without the exclamation point).
*In both ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', a character portrayed by comedian [[Peter Sellers]] tries on a Toulouse-Lautrec costume.
* On an episode of ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'' (Dough) [[Rik Mayall]]'s character Richie drinks a pint of [[absinthe]] and says "and they said Toulouse-Lautrec used to drink this, no wonder his legs fell off and his paintings were crap".
*There is an episode of ''[[The Inspector]]'' entitled "[[Toulouse La Trick]]" (an obvious [[word play|play on words]] on Lautrec's name). In the episode, The Inspector must guard a villain named Toulouse Le Moose, whose only similarity to Lautrec (besides the first name) is that he has a large upper body set on a small pair of legs.
*In the episode "[[Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost]]" of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', SpongeBob carries Squidward on a [[palanquin]], Squidward complains that it's "too cold" in one spot, so SpongeBob moves him to another that is "too hot", than finally to a spot that is "Toulouse-Lautrec" (complete with [[Sting (percussion)|sting]]), the background a parody of Lautrec's ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lautrec_la_troupe_de_mlle_eglantine_%28poster%29_1895-6.jpg "La Troupe de Mlle. Eglantine"]''.
* In the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' episode ''A Book at Bedtime'', the animated segment spoofs Impressionism by portraying Toulouse-Lautrec as a Western gunfighter in "No Time Toulouse, the Story of the Wild and Lawless Days of the Post-Impressionists".
