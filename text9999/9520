"'''The PTA Disbands'''" is the 21st episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]]. It originally aired on April 16, 1995. In the episode, [[Edna Krabappel]] calls an emergency [[Strike action|strike]] on behalf of the [[Teacher]]s' [[Trade union|Union]] of [[Springfield Elementary School|Springfield Elementary]], to protest against [[Principal Skinner]]'s miserly school spending. Students react in their own manner to the strike: [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] becomes obsessed with a desire to be graded, while [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] enjoys the extra time he has during the day. Bart arranges to keep the teachers union and Principal Skinner at an impasse, but becomes frustrated with [[substitute teacher]] arrangements and resolves to force negotiations forward. The situation is resolved when Krabappel and Skinner agree to rent space in classroom closets to the Springfield Prison.

The episode was written by [[Jennifer Crittenden]] and directed by [[Swinton O. Scott III]], with [[David Mirkin]] as show-runner. The episode includes cultural references to a number of books highlighted by Edna Krabappel as having been banned by other schools &ndash; including [[William Shatner]]'s ''[[TekWar]]'', ''[[Steal This Book]]'' by [[Abbie Hoffman]], and ''[[The Theory of Evolution]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]]. The episode received favorable mention in books on ''The Simpsons'' and media reviews, and was cited by academicians, who analyzed portions of the episode from [[physics]] and [[psychology]] perspectives. During a 2004 strike by voice actors for ''The Simpsons'' during salary negotiations, media sources cited an iconic quote from Homer to Lisa in the episode about the teachers strike.

==Plot==
[[File:PTA Disbands!(Jasper).jpg|thumb|left|[[Jasper Beardley|Jasper]] with his beard stuck in a [[pencil sharpener]] after being a substitute teacher for a day]] After a failed attempt at a school [[field trip]], which appears to have caused the apparent abandonment and brutal beating of the student [[<U+00DC>ter]], [[Edna Krabappel]] calls an emergency [[Strike action|strike]] on behalf of the [[Teacher]]s' [[Trade union|Union]] of [[Springfield Elementary School|Springfield Elementary]], to protest against [[Principal Skinner]]'s miserly spending on school supplies and activities.

As the teachers' strike results in the closing of the school, the various student characters respond to the sudden turn of events in their own ways: [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] becomes increasingly obsessive in her desire to be graded, [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] is forced by his parents to take private tutoring lessons (which improve his education), [[Jimbo Jones]] finds himself immersed in the intricacies of daytime [[soap opera]]s with his mother, Dolph and Kearney become easily bored with video games, and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] revels in his newfound afternoon freedom and annoys many Springfield citizens by imitating other people to make them angry or hurt each other. In particular, Bart does what he can to keep the union and Principal Skinner at odds with each other. The two sides are at an impasse; the union wanting a restoration of funding and Skinner maintaining that even with the spending reductions he has made, government budget cuts have squeezed the school dry.

After some prompting from an exasperated [[Marge Simpson]], the parents of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] eventually decide to take matters into their own hands, and recruit volunteers from the community to take over as temporary teachers. This turns out to be even worse for the students than before the strike, especially as Marge becomes Bart's new teacher and Jasper becomes Lisa's new teacher and gets his beard stuck in a pencil sharpener. Due to Marge's excessive mothering of Bart, he grudgingly resolves to force the strike negotiations forward. Together with Milhouse, he tricks both Krabappel and Principal Skinner into entering Skinner's office, which he then locks behind them. After spending several hours trapped together "like prisoners" in their own school, the two are mutually inspired with an idea to create extra revenue for more school spending. Things return to normal with the old teachers in charge, but with the school cloakrooms having been rented to the Springfield [[Prison]]. Each classroom now features several full prison cells at the back, which have the added benefit of keeping the more troublesome students in line.

==Production==
[[File:Davidmirkin.jpg|thumb|Much of the episode is based on [[David Mirkin]]'s experience as a child with schools running out of money.|alt=A seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into the distance. His hands are crossed.]]The episode was written by [[Jennifer Crittenden]]. She came in to the writers' room and pitched the idea that there should be a teachers' strike in an episode.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "The PTA Disbands"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Then-show runner [[David Mirkin]] thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his experience as a child with schools running out of money.<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "The PTA Disbands"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband.<ref name="Mirkin"/> In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] tells him the PTA has not disbanded.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

The episode was directed by [[Swinton O. Scott III]]. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down to give the impression that it did not have [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning.<ref name="Swinton">{{cite video | people=Swinton, Scott|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "The PTA Disbands"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor [[Tony Randall]].<ref name="Mirkin"/>

==Cultural references==
During their field trip, the bus from Springfield Elementary arrives at the Fort Springfield civil war site and skids into a cannon, knocking one of its wheels off. The cannon then points at the tower leg of a lookout, giving the impression that it will fire at the lookout and destroy it, which is a reference to the opening sequence of the television sitcom ''[[F Troop]]''. The lookout was also modeled after the lookout in the show.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The scene in which <U+00DC>ter is left behind at the end of the field trip is based on a scene from the 1965 film ''[[Von Ryan's Express]]''.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

Edna points at some school books and says: "The only books we have are ones that were banned by other schools." Skinner picks up a book called ''[[TekWar]]'', and says: "Well, the kids have to learn about ''TekWar'' sooner or later," referencing [[William Shatner]]'s series of [[science fiction]] novels.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Other books in the bookshelf include ''[[Sexus (The Rosy Crucifixion)|Sexus]]'' by [[Henry Miller]], ''[[Hop on Pop]]'' by [[Dr. Seuss]], ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' ("Junior Illustrated Edition") by [[Salman Rushdie]], ''40 Years of Playboy'' by [[Hugh Hefner]], ''[[Steal This Book]]'' by [[Abbie Hoffman]], and ''[[The Theory of Evolution]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]].<ref name="martyn">{{Harvnb|Martyn|Wood|2000}}</ref><ref name="turner">{{Harvnb|Turner|2005|p=182}}</ref>

Bart tells Skinner in the principal's office that Edna told him that Skinner "folds faster than [[Superman]] on laundry day", a reference to the comic book character Superman.<ref name="Mirkin"/> That line is one of ''The Simpsons'' animator [[David Silverman]]'s favorite lines on the show.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "The PTA Disbands"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Gabe Kaplan]] is one of Bart's victims on his substitute list, a reference to Kaplan and his character in the 1975 TV series ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]''.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The character at the bank who tells the angry crowd that their money's in "Bill's house, and Fred's house" is based on [[James Stewart]]'s [[George Bailey (fictional character)|George Bailey]] character from ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, "The PTA Disbands" finished 69th in ratings for the week of March 13-19, 1995, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 7.1. It was the 8th highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.<ref>{{cite news |title=How they rate|work=St. Petersburg Times|author=|page=15|date=April 21, 1995}}</ref>

In their book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood describe "The PTA Disbands" as "Possibly the best of the school episodes."<ref name="martyn" /> In a review of the sixth season of ''The Simpsons'', Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes: "I especially like the contrasts between how Bart and Lisa accept the strike. The show doesn<U+2019>t quite manage to soar consistently, but it has more than enough to make it positive."<ref>{{cite news  | last =Jacobson  | first =Colin | title =The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season (1994) | work =DVD Movie Guide | publisher =www.dvdmg.com | date =August 15, 2005 | url =http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonsix.shtml | accessdate = December 19, 2008 }}</ref> In his review of the episode for ''TV Squad'', Adam Finley comments: "I love how Bart and Lisa both handle the news differently. Bart is thrilled ... Lisa, on the other hand, can't handle not being graded and evaluated every day, and slowly begins to lose her mind."<ref>{{cite news  | last = Finley  | first = Adam | title = The Simpsons: The PTA Disbands! | work = TV Squad | publisher = [[AOL|AOL television]]  | date = September 1, 2006 | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/09/01/the-simpsons-the-pta-disbands/ | accessdate = December 20, 2008}}</ref>

In 2004, when the voice actors for ''The Simpsons'' went on strike requesting additional income, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' cited a quote by Homer from the episode: "If you don't like your job, you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American Way."<ref name="scotsman">{{cite news  | last =Staff | title =The Scotsman: Leader: The immigration fiasco comes to a head | work =[[The Scotsman]] | page =21 | publisher =[[Johnston Press]] | date =April 2, 2004  }}</ref> ''The Scotsman'' asserted "Homer would not approve" of the strike by the voice actors.<ref name="scotsman" /> The voice actors were asking for an increase from [[United States dollar|US$]]125,000 to $360,000 per episode.<ref name="variety" /> The same quote by Homer to Lisa was cited by Michael Schneider in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'', who wrote: "..insiders note that the actors work just six to seven hours to voice an episode --- which would mean $ 360,000 for a day's work, a figure that even "Everybody Loves Raymond" star Ray Romano doesn't match."<ref name="variety">{{cite news  | last =Schneider  | first =Michael  | title =Oh no, here they d'oh!!! again  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]  | page =1  | publisher =Reed Elsevier Inc | date =April 1, 2004 }}</ref>

[[University of the Sciences in Philadelphia]] [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] professor Paul Halpern discusses the episode in his book ''What's Science Ever Done for Us?: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe'', and quotes Homer's admonition to Lisa: "Lisa, in this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!" at the beginning of Halpern's section on "Mechanical Plots".<ref name="halpern69">{{Harvnb|Halpern|2007|p=69}}</ref> Halpern describes Lisa's efforts to build a [[perpetual-motion]] machine while bored during the teachers strike, and comments that though it is absurd in reality to order someone to obey the laws of thermodynamics, he acknowledges that "physicists sometimes don't know the proper arena within which certain laws apply".<ref name="halpern80">{{Harvnb|Halpern|2007|pp=80<U+2013>81}}</ref> In the July 26, 2007 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the scientific journal's editorial staff listed "The PTA Disbands" among "The Top Ten science moments in ''The Simpsons''", writing: "Lisa gets so bored by a lack of schooling she builds a perpetual motion machine. Homer is not pleased: 'Lisa, in this house we OBEY the laws of thermodynamics.'"<ref name=Nature>{{cite journal|last=Hopkin|first=Michael|title=Science in comedy: Mmm... pi|journal=[[Nature (journal){{!}}Nature]]|date=2007-07-26|volume=448|issue=7152|pages=404<U+2013>405|doi=10.1038/448404a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7152/box/448404a_BX1.html|accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref> 

The episode is cited by Robert M. Arkin and Philip J. Mazzocco in their work "Self-Esteem in Springfield", in the compilation book ''[[The Psychology of The Simpsons]]''.<ref name="brown">{{Harvnb|Brown|Logan|2006|p=124}}</ref> Arkin and Mazzocco note an exchange between [[Edna Krabappel]] and [[Seymour Skinner]], where Skinner exclaims to Krabappel: "Oh come on Edna: We both know these kids ''have'' no future! [''All the children stop and look at him; he chuckles nervously''] Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong."<ref name="brown" /> Arkin and Mazzocco note that this example is seen as an exception, writing: "Generally, however, the Simpsons are right on target in their understanding of the importance of self-esteem and the dynamics involved in the interplay between the social world and positive self-regard."<ref name="brown" />
