The '''[[History of Dallas, Texas|history]] of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]) from 1874 to 1929''' documents the city's [[industrialization]]. Originally a small community built around [[agriculture]], the [[History of Dallas, Texas (1856-1873)#Railroad convergence|convergence of several railroads in Dallas]] made the city a strategic location for several expanding [[industry|industries]]. During the time, Dallas prospered and grew to become the most populous city in Texas,<ref name="population_note">{{scaps|side note}}: The city surpassed was [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. Alongside strong population growth, Dallas annexed the city of [[Old East Dallas, Dallas, Texas|East Dallas]], which placed it ahead of Houston.</ref> lavish [[Structural steel|steel]] and [[masonry]] structures replaced [[timber framing|timber constructions]], and [[Dallas Zoo|a zoo]], [[Southern Methodist University|a university]] and [[Love Field|an airport]] were established.  Conversely, the city suffered multiple setbacks with a [[recession]] from a series of [[market failure|failing markets]] (the "[[History of Dallas, Texas (1874-1929)#Panic of 1893|Panic of 1893]]") and [[History of Dallas, Texas (1874-1929)#1908 flood|the disastrous flooding]] of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] in the spring of 1908.

== Shift to industry ==
[[Image:Missouri-Kansas-Texas Advertisement 1881.jpg|thumb|right|225px|An advertisement for the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad in an 1881 Dallas city directory]]
The shift towards [[manufacturing]] and [[heavy industry]] in Dallas formed partially out of problems hurting Dallas area [[farming|farmers]]. After purchasing supplies on [[credit (finance)|credit]] during the year, farmers owed [[merchant]]s the majority of their [[crop]] due to high [[shipping]] costs to [[Gulf Coast of the United States|the coast]] and the falling price of [[cotton]]. A group known as the [[Farmers' Alliance]], created in 1877, hoped to break this cycle of [[poverty]] by setting up a Dallas [[warehouse]] to ship cotton to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] because the cost of shipping to [[Missouri]] was significantly lower than the cost of shipping to the coast. However, bankers refused to [[Finance#Business_finance|finance]] the warehouse, and the venture failed within twenty months.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>

Dallas' growing industrial sector was a boon to both its citizens and the city's [[wiktionary:coffer|coffer]]s &mdash; growing in wealth from its booming economy, the city began to light its streets with [[gas lighting|gas lamp]]s (the first appeared in 1874) and began to [[pavement (material)#Other paving methods|brick over]] dirt lanes. In 1880, the first [[telephone]] line came to Dallas, linking the water company and the [[fire station]].<ref name="historicalsociety">[[Dallas Historical Society]] - [http://www.dallashistory.org/history/dallas/dallas_history.htm Dallas History].

== Outlaws ==
Dallas' status as a young, wealthy city in a practical-[[frontier]] made it very attractive to numerous and iconic [[outlaw]]s. [[Belle Starr]] began her [[w:stint|stint]]s in Dallas as a [[dance hall]] [[dancer]] and [[singer]], and later harbored outlaws and sold stolen [[horses]].<ref name="historicalsociety"/> [[Doc Holliday]] came to Dallas to restore his health where he opened a [[dentist]]'s office, but he soon turned to [[gambling]].

== Panic of 1893 ==
Following the [[Panic of 1893|national financial "Panic of 1893"]], numerous industries and five Dallas [[bank]]s failed. [[Cotton]] prices dipped below five cents a [[pound (mass)|pound]], and the [[lumber]] and [[flour]] markets had all but vanished.<ref name="handbook">{{Handbook of Texas|name=Dallas, Texas|id=DD/hdd1}}.

By 1898 however, the city began to recover and grow again.  The economic panic also affected [[trade union|unionized labor]], which had just begun to organize: the [[American Federation of Labor]] granted a charter to the Trades Assembly of Dallas in 1899.<ref name="handbook"/> In 1894, [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]] opened just west of [[Oak Lawn, Dallas|Oak Lawn]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/ DallasNews.com]: [http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/spe/2002/hiddenhistory/1876-1900/vitindex.html Hidden History of Dallas (1876-1900)].  Retrieved on [[12 September]] [[2006]].</ref>  In 1903, [[Oak Cliff]], a city across the Trinity River, was annexed.  The same year, the [[Wilson Building]], patterned after [[Paris]]' Grand Opera House, opened on [[Main Street, Dallas|Main Street]] in [[downtown Dallas|downtown]].<ref name="wilsonbuilding">[http://dallaslibrary.org/ Dallas Public Library] - [http://dallaslibrary.org/ctx/photogallery/downtownliving/wilson.htm Wilson Building].

By the turn of the century Dallas was the leading [[drug]], [[book]], [[jewelry]], and wholesale [[liquor]] market in the [[Southwestern United States]].<ref name="handbook"/> It also quickly became the center of trade in [[cotton]], [[cereal|grain]], and [[bison]]. It was the world's leading inland cotton market, and it still led the world in the manufacturing of [[saddlery]] and [[cotton gin]] machinery.<ref name="handbook"/> As it further entered the 20th century, Dallas transformed from an agricultural center to a center of [[banking]], [[insurance]], and other businesses.

== 1908 flood ==
The relationship between Dallas and the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] was never as healthy as Dallasites had hoped for. Dallas's establishment on the banks of the Trinity was done with hopes that navigation south to the [[Trinity Bay|Trinity]] and [[Galveston Bay|Galveston]] Bays, and ultimately the [[Gulf of Mexico]], would be realized. However, attempts to even move [[paddleboat]]s up and down the river proved futile, and plans to transform the river into a [[canal]] never came to fruition. The Trinity also suffered from chronic flooding: floods occurred in 1844, 1866, 1871, and 1890, but none were as bad as the flood of 1908. On [[26 May]] [[1908]], the Trinity River reached a depth of {{convert|52.6|ft|m|2}} and a width of {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}}.<ref name="paynechapV">{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |id= ISBN 0-89781-034-1 |pages=119-155 |chapter= Chapter V: A New Century, A New Dallas}}</ref>  Five people died, 4,000 were left homeless, and property damages were estimated at [[United States dollar|$]]2.5 million.<ref name="paynechapV"/>

{{cquote|Now the wreckage of a shed or outhouse would move by, followed by a drowned [[swine]] or other [[livestock]].  The construction forces of the Texas & Pacific worked feverishly to safeguard the long trestle carrying their tracks across the stream. Suddenly this whole structure turned on its side down-stream, broke loose from the rest of the track at one end and swung out into the middle of the current and began breaking up, first into large sections and then into smaller pieces, rushing madly along to some uncertain destination.  [Approximately half a dozen of the workmen fell into the torrent at this point; exaggerated reports of their drowning swept the city.]|4=C.L. Moss|5=<ref name="paynechapV"/>}}

Dallas was without [[electricity|power]] for three days, all [[telephone]] and [[telegraph]] service was down, and rail service was canceled.  The only way to reach Oak Cliff was by boat.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>  [[West Dallas]] was hit harder than any other part of the city&mdash;the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' said "indescribable suffering" plagued the area.  Much to the horror of residents, thousands of [[livestock]] drowned in the flood and some became lodged in the tops of trees&mdash;the stench of their decay hung over the city as the water subsided.<ref name="paynechapV"/>

After the disastrous flood, the city wanted to find a way to control the reckless Trinity and to build a [[bridge]] linking [[Oak Cliff]] and Dallas.  The immediate reaction was citizens and the city clamoring to build an indestructible, all-weather crossing over the Trinity.  This had already been attempted following the 1890 flood&mdash;the result was the "Long Wooden Bridge," that connected Jefferson Boulevard in Oak Cliff and Cadiz in Dallas, but the unstable wooden structure was washed swiftly away by the 1908 flood.  [[George Dealey|George B. Dealey]], publisher of the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', proposed a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} [[concrete]] bridge based on a bridge crossing the [[Missouri River]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].  Ultimately a [[United States dollar|US$]]650,000 bond election was approved and in 1912, the Oak Cliff viaduct (now the Houston Street viaduct) was opened among festivities drawing 58,000 spectators.<ref name="paynechapV"/>  The bridge, at the time, was the longest concrete structure in the world.<ref name="paynechapV"/>

Efforts beyond this had begun in 1911 when [[George Kessler]], a city planner, created a plan for both the Trinity and the city.  His plans included using levees to [[canal|divert the river]], removing [[railroad]] lines on Pacific Avenue, consolidating [[train station|rail depot]]s into a central station, new [[park]]s and [[playground]]s, and the straightening and widening of several [[street]]s.  Most of his plans lay unimplemented, but in later years, many began to see its importance.  In 1920, Kessler was brought back to update his plan and by the 1930s many of his plans had been realized.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>

== Aviation, education and financial center ==
[[Image:Dallas, Texas Main Street 1913.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Looking east down Main from Akard in 1913]]
Efforts began in 1910 to have Southwestern University in [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]] relocate to Dallas. The school refused, but this action brought Dallas to the attention of the [[Methodism|Methodists]]. They voted in 1911 to establish a [[university]] in Dallas, after the city offered $300,000 and {{convert|666.5|acre|sqkm|2}} of land for the campus. In 1915, [[Southern Methodist University]] opened and is still operational today.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>

In 1911, Dallas became the location of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|eleventh regional branch]] of the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Bank. The city had campaigned to have it located in Dallas for years, and the bank's arrival assured Dallas's place as a major financial center.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>

In 1912, The [[Adolphus Hotel]] was constructed in [[downtown Dallas]].  The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts style]] building, at 21-stories and {{convert|312|ft|m|0}} was the tallest building in [[Texas]] at the time.  It officially opened on [[5 October]] [[1912]].  In August 1922, the 29-story [[Magnolia Hotel|Magnolia Petroleum Building]] (now the Magnolia Hotel) opened next door and took the title of tallest-in-Texas.<ref>[http://www.dallassky.com/ Dallassky.com] - [http://www.dallassky.com/bldg26.htm Magnolia Building].  Retrieved on [[24 August]] [[2006]].</ref>

[[Aviation]] became a major issue in the city in [[World War I]].  [[Love Field]] was established as an aviation training ground, and [[Fair Park]] was the home of [[Camp Dick]], a training facility as well.  The city purchased Love Field in 1927 to use as a municipal airport.<ref name="historicalsociety"/>
