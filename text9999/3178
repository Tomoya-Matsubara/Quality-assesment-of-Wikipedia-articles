The '''Madison River''' is a headwater [[tributary]] of the [[Missouri River]], approximately 183 miles (295&nbsp;km) long, in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]]. Its [[confluence]] with the [[Jefferson River|Jefferson]] and [[Gallatin River|Gallatin]] rivers near [[Three Forks, Montana]] form the Missouri River.

The Madison rises in [[Park County, Wyoming|Park County]] in northwestern Wyoming at the confluence of the [[Firehole River|Firehole]] and [[Gibbon River|Gibbon]] rivers, a location known as Madison Junction in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. It flows west then north through the mountains of southwestern Montana to join the Jefferson and Gallatin rivers at Three Forks.  The [[Missouri River Headwaters State Park]] is located on the Madison at Three Forks.<ref>[http://fwp.mt.gov/lands/site_281910.aspx Montana Fish and Wildlife and Parks]</ref>  In its upper reaches in [[Gallatin County, Montana]], the [[Hebgen Dam]] forms [[Hebgen Lake]]. In its middle reaches in [[Madison County, Montana]], the Madison Dam forms [[Ennis Lake]] and provides [[hydroelectric power]]. In 1959, the [[1959 Yellowstone earthquake|Hebgen Lake earthquake]] formed [[Quake Lake]] just downstream from Hebgen Dam.  Downstream from Ennis, the Madison flows through Bear Trap Canyon, known for its class IV-V [[Whitewater kayaking|whitewater]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Hank |coauthors=Fischer, Carol |title=Paddling Montana |publisher=The Globe Pequot Press |location=Guildford, CT |isbn=978-0-7627-4352-0 |year=2008 |pages=111<U+2013>113}}</ref>  The Bear Trap Canyon section is part of the [[Lee Metcalf Wilderness]] area. 

The river was named in July 1805 by [[Meriwether Lewis]] at Three Forks.  The central fork of the three, it was named for [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[James Madison]], who would succeed [[Thomas Jefferson]] as [[President of the United States|President]] in 1809.  The western fork, the largest, was named for President Jefferson and the east fork for [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Albert Gallatin]].

The Madison is a Class I river in Montana for the purposes of access for recreational use.<ref name=StreamAccess>[http://fwp.mt.gov/content/getItem.aspx?id=24929 Stream Access in Montana]</ref>

==Angling the Madison==

The Madison River, from Madison Junction in Yellowstone to Three Forks, is a [[fly fishing]] mecca for serious anglers.  It is classified as a [[Blue Ribbon fisheries|blue ribbon fishery]] in Montana and is one of the most productive streams in Montana for [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]] and [[mountain whitefish]].<ref name="MFWMadison">[http://fwp.mt.gov/fishing/guide/q_Madison_River__1115074459269_23.2099990844727_131.559997558594.aspx Montana Fish and Wildlife-Madison River Data]</ref>

For angling purposes, the Madison can be divided into four distinct sections.

|The {{convert|19|mi|km}} of the Madison in the park, although easily accessible, is not suited for beginners and offers technical dry fly and nymph fishing for rainbow and brown trout averaging from ten to fourteen inches (356&nbsp;mm), with an occasional 20-incher. Most of the river inside the park resembles a large spring creek and has been called the ''world's largest [[Chalk stream|chalkstream]]''.

The Madison is an early summer and fall river and offers poor fishing in midsummer because of high temperatures contributed by the Firehole. Fishing in the fall is excellent when significant numbers of brown and rainbow trout enter the river from Hebgen Lake.  These are usually taken with large streamer patterns.  Many pools and runs on the Madison have angler-given names reminiscent of eastern trout stream and British salmon rivers<U+2014>The Barns, Beaver Meadows, Grasshopper Bank, Cable Car Run and Baker's Hole,.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathews |first=Craig |coauthors=Molinero, Clayton |title=The Yellowstone Fly-Fishing Guide-A authoritative guide to the waters of Yellowstone National Park |publisher=The Lyons Press |location=Guilford, CT |year=1997 |isbn=1-55821-545-X |pages=37<U+2013>40}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Parks |first=Richard |title=Fishing Yellowstone National Park |year=1998 |publisher=Falcon Press |location=Helena, MT |isbn=1-56044-625-0 |pages=30<U+2013>34}}</ref>

The Madison River is fly fishing only in Yellowstone National Park and all fishing is catch and release.<ref name=YNPFishReg>[http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/fishreg09.pdf 2009 Yellowstone National Park Fishing Regulations]</ref>

|After the Madison River takes its leave from Yellowstone Park, it meanders out into the beautiful ranch lands of southwestern Montana. It is here that its true character is revealed and its reputation as a world-class fishery is secured. The Madison rolls majestically through cottonwood lined banks and over riffles and quiet runs that harbor large rainbows and trophy browns. The Madison River flows along Yellowstone<U+2019>s West Entrance road into Hebgen Lake outside the park. In 1959, the Hebgen Lake earthquake formed Quake Lake just downstream from Hebgen Dam.<ref>

|Directly below Quake Lake a three mile (5&nbsp;km) long whitewater section resulted from the 1959 earthquake. It is characterized by a steep gradient of river including large boulders with Class III and Class IV whitewater.

Below the whitewater section the river turns into a swift flowing but gentle river for {{convert|53|mi|km}} to Ennis lake. This section has often been called the ''Fifty Mile Riffle'' and provides the best fly fishing on the river.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holt |first=John |title=River Journal - Madison |publisher=Frank Amato Publications |year=1993 |isbn=1-878175-27-0 |pages=27 |location=Portland, OR }}</ref>
