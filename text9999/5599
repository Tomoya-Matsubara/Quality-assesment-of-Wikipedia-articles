]]
'''Homosexuality in speculative fiction''' refers to the incorporation of gay themes into [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] fiction. Such elements may include an [[LGBT]] character as the protagonist or a major character, or explore the varieties of [[human sexual behavior|sexual experience]] that deviate from the conventional. 

As genres of popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem even more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterization and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also to promise more freedom than do non-genre literatures to imagine alternatives to the privileged assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that suffuse many cultures.<ref name="glbtq"/>

In speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] has called, "cognitive estrangement," the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose change forces us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective.<ref name="Suvin cog estrangment">Darko Suvin ''Metamorphoses of Science Fiction'', Yale Univ Pr: 1979 ISBN-13: 978-0300023756</ref> When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her [[heteronormative]] cultural assumptions. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures, such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. <ref name="glbtq">http://www.glbtq.com/literature/scifi_fantasy.html</ref> 

Author and editor [[Nicola Griffith]] has written that GLBT readers tend to identify strongly with the outsider status of mutants, aliens, and characters who lead hidden or double lives in science fiction.<ref name="Bending landscape SF">Nicola Griffith, Stephen Pagel ''Bending the Landscape.

===Homosexuality during the Pulp era (1920-30s)===
[[Image:Odd John first edition cover.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover of first edition of [[Odd John]] (1935)]]

Prior to the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of science fiction and fantasy. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. In such a context, writers like [[Edgar Pangborn]] who featured passionate male friendships in their work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much.

As the demographics of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a decadent slaveholding lordling whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero.<ref name="encylhomos">http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/index.php/Encyclopedia_of_Homosexuality</ref>. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villians.<ref name="encylhomos"/>

One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early science fiction novel ''[[Odd John]]''  (1935), by [[Olaf Stapledon]].  John is a [[mutant]] with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he has consensual [[intercourse]] with his mother Pax and that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.

===Homosexuality during the Golden Age (1940-50s)===
[[Image:Universe 53 cover featuring the World Well Lost.jpg|thumb|150px|June 1953's issue of ''Universe'']]

As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however, writers like [[Philip Jose Farmer]] and [[Theodore Sturgeon]] were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work. [[Theodore Sturgeon|Sturgeon]] wrote many stories during the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] that emphasised the importance of love, regardless of the current social norms. In his short story ''[[The World Well Lost]]''  (1953), first published in ''Universe'' magazine and collected in ''[[A Saucer of Loneliness]]'', homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited (and taboo) human homosexual love are portrayed. The tagline for the ''Universe'' cover was "[His] most daring story"<ref>http://www.spacedoutinc.org/DU-16/WorldWellLost.html</ref>; Its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time. 

Sturgeon would later write ''Affair with a Green Monkey'', which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals, and in 1960 published ''[[Venus Plus X]]'', in which a single-gender society is depicted and the protagonist's homophobia portrayed unfavourably.<ref name="encylhomos"/>

Although not usually identified as a genre writer like Sturgeon, [[William S. Burroughs]] in 1959 published ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', the first of many works such as ''[[The Nova Trilogy]]'' and ''[[The Wild Boys (novel)|The Wild Boys]]'' in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities. The result was a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do.

Until the late 1960s, however, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles with Sturgeon's tolerance for the alternative or Burroughs's intolerance for the ordinary. Images of homosexual male societies remained strongly negative in the eyes of most SF authors. For example, when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in [[Charles Beaumont]]'s short story ''The Crooked Man'' (1955), first published in [[Playboy]] inhumane homosexuals begin to oppress their heterosexual minority. In [[Anthony Burgess]]<U+2019> ''[[The Wanting Seed]]''  (1962) homosexuality is required for official employment, part of an unnatural state of affairs along with by failing of the natural world and violent warfare.<ref name="encylhomos"/>

===Homosexuality during the New Wave era (1960-70s)===
By the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called "the [[New Wave (science fiction)|new wave]]," a movement more skeptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in "inner space" instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Notable openly gay male authors included [[Thomas M. Disch]] and [[Samuel R. Delany]]. Under the influence of New wave editors and authors such as [[Michael Moorcock]] (editor of the influential New Worlds) and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy. [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975) and the award winning story ''[[When It Changed]]'', showing a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, was also enourmously influential.
[[Image:dhalgren vintage.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''[[Dhalgren]]'' Vintage edition book cover]]

In the earliest stories of [[Samuel R. Delany]], the gay sexual aspect appears as a "sensibility", rather than in overt sexual references.  ''[[Nova (novel)|Nova]]''  (1968) is the first major science fiction novel with a gay male protagonist, nominated for a Hugo award and listed by critic [[David Pringle]] as one of the 100 best SF novel from 1949 to 1984.<ref name="Pringle list">David Pringle, ''Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels : An English-Language Selection, 1949-1984'', Carroll & Graf Publishers: 1997 ISBN-13: 978-0786704811</ref> In some stories, such as ''[[Babel-17]]'' (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because one character is a woman who is involved in a three-person [[marriage]], the other two members of which are males. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In later works, Delany blurs the line between science fiction and gay pornography.

[[Nebula]]-winning short story ''[[Aye, and Gomorrah]]'', which posits the development of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. Further award winning stories featuring gay characters, such as ''[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]'' were to follow (all collected in Delany's short story retrospective ''[[Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories]]'').<ref name="encylhomos"/>

In his most famous science fiction novel entitled ''[[Dhalgren]]''  (1975), Delany spots his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities.<ref name="Dhalgrenrev">David Soyko, "Dhalgren", on-line review (2002) [http://www.sfsite.com/02b/dh122.htm SFSite]</ref> Once again, sex activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF. Delany depicts, mostly with affection, characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviors, not, it would seem, with the intent of a kind of covert advocacy but with the effect of revealing to the reader the fact that these kinds of people exist in the real world. 

In ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] (1973), the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex. [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]  explored trans-[[species]] sexuality in ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]''  (1969), the sexuality of species in which individuals are neither "male" nor "female" but normally have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities. Le Guin has subsequently written many stories that examine the posibilities SF allows for non-traditional homosexuality, such as the sexual bonding between clones in [[Nine Lives (novelette)|Nine Lives]] (collected in [[The Wind's Twelve Quarters]]).<ref name="encylhomos"/>

[[Elizabeth A. Lynn|Elizabeth Lynn]]'s ''Chronicles of Tornor'' novels  (1979-80), the first of which won the World Fantasy Award, were among the first [[fantasy]] novels to have gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background.

===Modern Gay SF (Post New Wave)===
After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s, homosexuality gained much wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. This was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors,<ref name="encylhomos"/> such as [[David Gerrold]] and [[Geoff Ryman]]. In the 1980s blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers.<ref name="encylhomos"/>

[[Image:Magic's Price.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''[[Magic's Price]]'' cover art]] 
Gay characters became common enough that [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' ''[[The Tough Guide to Fantasyland]]'' contains an entry on ''gay mages'' as a fantasy cliche.<ref>Diana Wynne Jones. The Tough Guide to Fantasyland. DAW (December 1, 1998). ISBN-13: 978-0886778323</ref> Such characters are found in [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s works,<ref name="Lackey"/> such as the Lambda award winning ''[[Mercedes_Lackey#The_Last_Herald_Mage|''The Last Herald Mage'' Trilogy]]'' (1989), in which the protagonists are gay,<ref name="glbtq"/> and have magical powers. Their relationships are an integral part of the story, which takes places in the [[fictional world]] of [[Valdemar]]. 

[[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s [[Ethan of Athos]] tells of a reproductive scientist on a planet with no women.

In the [[Mythopoeic Awards|Mythopoeic award]] winning ''[[Michael Bishop (author)#Unicorn Mountain|Unicorn Mountain]]'' (1988), [[Michael Bishop (author)|Michael Bishop]] includes a gay male [[AIDS]] patient among the carefully drawn central characters who must respond to an irruption of dying unicorns at their Colorado ranch. The death of the hedonistic gay culture and safe-sex campaign resulting from the AIDS epidemic are also explored, both literally and metaphorically.

[[Anne McCaffrey]]'s [[Dragonriders of Pern]] series contains a society with a hierarchy partially based on the sexual partnerings of dragons. When dragons mate, their riders do the same. As most riders are male, homosexuality is common. 	

[[David Gerrold]]'s young adult series starts with ''Jumping Off the Planet'' (2000), in which a father kidnaps his three sons and goes to the moon; one is gay.  Gerrold received a [[Nebula award]] for a short story [[The Martian Child]] (1994). He later expanded it to book length; a feature film is expected in 2007. The story is semi-autobiographical: a gay man adopts a child.

[[Duane Simolke]] received a StoneWall Society award for ''Degranon: A Science Fiction Adventure'' (2004), which includes gay themes and characters, and is a prominent example of SF produced by a specialist publishing house for gay readers rather than for SF fans.

== LGBT SF and the science fiction community ==
[[Image:Gaylactic logo.gif|thumb|200px| Logo of the [[Gaylactic Network]]]]
At least as early as the 1980 [[Worldcon]] ([[38th World Science Fiction Convention|Noreascon Two]]), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] and [[Melissa Scott (writer)|Melissa Scott]] <ref>Bacon-Smith, Camille. ''Science Fiction Culture,'' pp. 138-140</ref>. Members of [[science fiction fandom]] (including [[Forrest J Ackerman]]) were involved in the foundation of early groups such as the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], a lesbian rights group.  

By 1988, the first [[Gaylaxicon]] [[science fiction convention]] was held. This led to the creation of the [[Gaylactic Network]] and the [[Gaylactic Spectrum Awards]] by the [[science fiction fandom|science fiction community]].<ref>http://www.gaylacticnetwork.org/</ref>  Gay-themed discussions are now a staple at conventions such as [[WisCon]]; For example, WisCon 30 featured a panel discussing "Why Women Write About Gay Men."

===Awards===
*The [[Gaylactic Spectrum Awards]] honor works in science fiction, fantasy and horror which include positive explorations of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered characters, themes, or issues.
*The [[Lambda Literary Award]] includes an award for Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror.
*The [http://www.queerhorror.com/awards/ Queer Horror Awards] were created to honor works that involve significant, and generally positive, portrayal of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender characters, issues or themes within the area of horror.

===Specialist LGBT presses===

Some lesbian science fiction is targeted specifically to a lesbian audience, published by small feminist or lesbian presses such as [[Naiad Press]] (defunct) and [[Bella Books]].

==Comics and Manga==

For much of the 20th century, gay relationships were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989 the [[Comics Code Authority]], which imposed ''[[de facto]]'' censorship on comics sold through newsstands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nyberg |first=Amy Kiste |title=Seal of Approval: The History of the Comics Code |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date=1998 |location=Jackson |pages=143, 175-176 |id=ISBN 0-878-05975-X }}</ref> Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation.<ref>{{cite news

====Marvel====
[[Alpha Flight]]<U+2019>s [[Northstar]] was the first major gay character created by [[Marvel comics]] in [[1979]], as a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team. Although Northstar's sexual identity was hinted at in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of ''Alpha Flight'', his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion <ref name='rzero'>http://www.rzero.com/books/gaysuperfull.html</ref>. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's ''Alpha Flight'' issue 106.<ref name='rzero'/>

A relationship between the female [[Marvel comics]] characters [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] was only implied at first, then cryptically confirmed in 1990 through the use of the archaic word ''[[wikt:leman|leman]]'', meaning a lover or sweetheart.<ref>Uncanny X-Men #265 (Early August, 1990).</ref> Only in 2001 was Destiny referred to in plain language as Mystique's lover.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #5 (May, 2001).</ref>

In 2002, [[Marvel Comics]] revived ''[[The Rawhide Kid]]'' in their [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint,<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/11/entertainment/main532702.shtml</ref> introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine.<ref name='CNN rawhide'>http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/12/09/rawhide.kid.gay/</ref> The first edition of the Rawhide Kid<U+2019>s gay saga was called ''Slap Leather''. According to a CNN.com article, <U+201C>The new series pairs the original artist, [[John Severin]], now 86, with [[Ron Zimmerman]], a television writer.

The character<U+2019>s sexuality is conveyed indirectly, through euphemisms and puns, and the comic<U+2019>s style is campy. <ref name='CNN rawhide'/>

====DC====

DC feature a number of LGBT characters as superheroes in their comics. 

[[Firebrand (DC Comics)|Firebrand]] is an early example: A superhero published by Quality Comics, premiering in Police Comics no. 1 (August, 1941), Firebrand's costume included a transparent or pink shirt over bare chest. In ''All-Star Squadron'' #5 (1981) writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons for that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn. "Good old Slugger! He's been Rod's bodyguard -- and his friend -- for years now -- though what a confirmed bachelor playboy like my brother needed with a bodyguard I've never understood!" Gay topics were still largely taboo in mass-circulation comic books in 1981, and words such as "confirmed bachelor" and references to a closeted identity were as close as a writer could come to actually saying that a character was gay.

A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero [[Midnighter]]. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with his Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority.<ref name="Lendrum">{{cite journal |last= Lendrum |first= Rob | title = Queering Super-Manhood: The Gay Superhero in Contemporary Mainstream Comic Books| work = Concordia University|url=http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=firefox-a&q=cache:_2muu35FMd4J:www.grconsortium.org/pdf/V.2-2PDF/v22_lendrum.pdf+Superman+Batman+Apollo+Midnighter|accessdate= 2007-10-07 |quote= ''When Batman and Superman team up they are called "the World's Finest."

In 2006 [[DC Comics]] could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character [[Batwoman]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Ferber |first=Lawrence |title=Queering the Comics |work=The Advocate |pages=51 |publisher= |date=[[July 18]], [[2006]]}}</ref> even while openly lesbian characters such as [[Gotham City]] police officer [[Renee Montoya]] already existed in DC Comics.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mangels |first=Andy |title=Outed in Batman's Backyard |work=The Advocate |pages=62 |date=[[May 27]], [[2003]] }}</ref>. Previously, [[WildStorm]]'s [[Image Comics]] had featured [[Sarah Rainmaker]] of [[Gen<U+00B9><U+00B3>]] as a character with an interest in other women, and had openly depicted homosexual relationships between the members of [[The Authority|the Authority]], such as [[Jenny Sparks]] and [[Swift (comics)|Swift]].<ref>''[[Jenny Sparks: The Secret History of the Authority]]'', mini-series published in 2000</ref>

====Yaoi and Yuri manga====
[[Image:InnocentBirdManga6.jpg|160px|thumb|Innocent Bird: Volume 2 USA Cover]]
{{main|Yaoi|Yuri (term)}}
{{Seealso|:Category:Yaoi}}

[[Yaoi]] (<U+3084><U+304A><U+3044>) is a publishing genre which focuses on male/male relationships and is marketed at females. Anal sex is uniquitous. The genre originated in [[Japan]] and encompasses [[manga]], [[anime]], novels and [[d<U+014D>jinshi]]. In Japan, this genre is called "''Boys' Love''" and [[yaoi]] as a genre name is mostly used by western fans.<ref name='Suchio on yaoi'/> Yaoi has spread beyond Japan; yaoi material is available in the United States, as well as other Western and Eastern nations worldwide. As with much manga and anime, SF and fantasy tropes and environments are common. For example ''[[Innocent Bird]]'' is a manga in which the main charcters are angels and demons.  [[Ai no Kusabi]] is a 1980s yaoi light novel series involving a science fictional caste system.  The characters of yaoi do not tend to self-identify as gay.  

There is also "gay manga" specifically targeted at gay men, with gay characters.  Yaoi writers and fans distinguish these "gay manga" as being separate from yaoi.<ref name='Suchio on yaoi'>http://www.csuchico.edu/~mtoku/vc/Articles/toku/Wil_Toku_BoysLove.html</ref>

The female (hence lesbian) counterpart of Yaoi is called [[Yuri]]. <ref name = "alc-yurix">{{cite web|url=http://www.yuricon.org/essays/yuri_fandom.html |title=Yuri Fandom on the Internet |publisher=[[Yuricon]] |last=Charlton |first=Sabdha |accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref><ref name ="cyzo">{{cite web |url=http://www.cyzo.com/2008/02/post_350.html |title=Joseid<U+014D>shi no LOVE wo egaita, danshi kinsei no "Yuri b<U+016B>mu" gayattekuru!? |publisher=Cyzo |accessdate=2008-03-21 |language=Japanese}}</ref> ''Yuri'' can focus either on the sexual or  the emotional aspects of the relationship, the latter sometimes being called ''sh<U+014D>jo-ai'' by western fans.<ref name = "whatisyuri">{{cite web | author=Friedman, Erica | title=What is Yuri? | url=http://www.yuricon.org/essays/whatisyuri.html | work=What are Yuri and Shoujoai, anyway? | publisher=Yuricon and ALC Publishing | accessmonthday=20 May | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Although yuri originated in female-targeted works, today it is featured in male-targeted ones as well.<ref name = "about-2">{{cite web |url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistswriters/a/EFriedman_2.htm |title=Interview: Erica Friedman (page 2) |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work=Manga |publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref><ref name ="yuricon">{{cite web|last=Subramian |first=Erin |url=http://www.yuricon.org/essays/women_loving_women.html|title=Women-loving Women in Modern Japan|publisher=[[Yuricon]] |accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>

==SF television and film==
In general, SF on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major SF franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual and transgendered (LGBT) relationships are more rare. The platonic close male relationships in television and film science fiction have been reinterpreted by fans as [[slash fiction]] - [[Kirk/Spock]] being the earliest example.

====Star Trek====
{{main|Sexuality in Star Trek}}

The [[Star Trek]] franchise's lack of same-sex relationship has long been a sore spot with LGBT fandom,<ref name="GLBCoST">{{cite web | url=http://www.webpan.com/dsinclair/trek.html | title=Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Characters on Star Trek - a 12-year saga of deceit, lies, excuses and broken promises | author=D. Sinclair | year=October 19, 2003 }}</ref> who point out that [[Gene Roddenberry]] had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in ''Star Trek'', but that the franchises coverage has remained meagre.<ref name="GLBCoST"/> 

Homosexuality has occasionally been treated as an "issue" within the new Star Trek franchises, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the [[1992]] [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]] episode "[[The Outcast]]," and the [[1995]] ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Rejoined]]," which was the first to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the Star Trek franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil "mirror universe" ("[[The Emperor's New Cloak]]") or body possession ("[[Warlord]]" and others), and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters.

In a [[2000]] ''Fandom ''interview, Star Trek screenwriter [[Ronald D. Moore]] suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to make any difference.<ref name="GLBCoST"/>

In recent years, a few of the Star Trek novels, which are officially licensed but not considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]], have featured serious direct (not alternate-universe, not due to body possession, etc.) same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character (Lieutenant Hawk from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'') as gay.

====Torchwood====
{{main|Themes in Torchwood|Torchwood}}
Torchwood is a British science fiction drama television programme, part of the long-running [[Doctor Who]] franchise, which began airing in 2006 on [[BBC Three]].

Torchwood explores several themes in its [[narrative]], in particular [[LGBT]] themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines [[homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] relationships. Although the nature of their sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation.
