'''Maria Owings Shriver''' (pronounced: {{IPA|/'<U+0283><U+0279>a<U+026A>v<U+025A>/}}; born [[November 6]], [[1955]])<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/08/1065601914303.html Shriver known for her political bloodlines] (October 9, 2003) ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. Accessed 2008-02-05.</ref> is an award-winning [[United States|American]] journalist from the [[Kennedy Family]], a prolific author and [[First Lady of California]]. Her husband is [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].

==Early life==
Shriver was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. A [[Roman Catholic]] of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[German people|German]] descent,{{Fact|date=May 2008}} she was the second child and only daughter of the politician [[Sargent Shriver]] and [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]]; Eunice is the sister of the former President [[John F. Kennedy]]. She attended [[Westland Middle School]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], a suburb of [[Washington, DC]], and graduated with the class of 1973 from [[Stone Ridge School|Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart]] in Bethesda, Maryland. Shriver received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[American Studies]] from [[Georgetown University]] in June 1977.

==Career==
In her book ''[[Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out Into The Real World]]'', Shriver says that she became passionate about [[broadcast journalism]] after being sent to the back of the campaign plane with the [[press corps]] when volunteering for her father's [[United States presidential election, 1972|vice presidential race]], calling these orders "the best thing that ever happened to me." After her journalism career began with [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], she co-anchored the ''[[CBS Morning News]]'' with [[Forrest Sawyer]] from 1985 until 1987, co-anchored ''[[Sunday Today]]'' and weekend editions of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' from 1987 until 1989, and was a contributing anchor on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' from 1989 until 2004. In August 2003, Shriver took an unpaid leave of absence from [[NBC News]] when her husband became a candidate in the [[2003 California recall]].

Upon her husband's inauguration as the 38th [[Governor of California]], she became the First Lady of California on [[November 17]], [[2003]]. She then returned to reporting, making two more appearances for ''Dateline NBC.''

On [[February 3]], [[2004]], Shriver was told by NBC she was to be "relieved of [her] duties at NBC News," citing the conflict of interest between her role as a journalist and her status as the First Lady of California and her increasing role as an advocate of her husband's administration.

Shriver has played a minor role in ''Be Prepared'', an episode of the television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' as herself promoting
a "Preparedness Plan". She also appeared as herself in the film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''. On [[March 23]], [[2007]], Shriver returned to television news as substitute host of panel-discussion talk show ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on [[CNN]]. Shriver moderated a discussion of breast cancer and its effects with cancer specialist Dr. [[Susan Love]], musician [[Sheryl Crow]], and other guests.

Shriver announced that she will not return to news media after the excessive media coverage of the death of [[Anna Nicole Smith]].<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-10-24-shriver-NBC_N.htm?csp=34 Maria Shriver won't return to NBC News].

==First Lady of California==
[[Image:Twc maria.jpg|thumb|right|Maria Shriver speaking at the [[Women's Conference]].]]
During her husband's tenure as the Governor of California, Shriver was initially tentative in her role as the Governor's wife. Some speculated that she felt that her husband would not attempt to gain the Governor's seat in the recall election that drove [[Gray Davis]] from office. When Arnold announced his candidacy abruptly on the ''[[Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', she played the part of the loyal political spouse. Since Governor Schwarzenegger took office, Maria has visibly supported her husband and has taken on several key initiatives as first lady - raising awareness of the contributions of women to the state, working on practical solutions to end [[Cycle of poverty|cycles of poverty]] and encouraging all Californians to engage in acts of service to their communities. As her husband proposed a series of California ballot initiatives in November 2005, she decided to forgo any public support of her husband's proposals.

Prior to her work at NBC, Shriver had co-anchored the ''[[CBS Morning News]]''. She has won [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards and is the author of six best-selling books: ''[[What's Heaven]]'', ''[[Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out Into The Real World]]'', ''[[What's Wrong with Timmy?]]'', ''[[What's Happening to Grandpa?]]'', ''[[And One More Thing Before You Go]]'', and ''[[Just Who Will You Be?]]''.

On [[February 3]], [[2008]], Shriver endorsed the candidacy of Senator [[Barack Obama]] for the Democratic Presidential Nomination in 2008. It was done during a rally held at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] featuring [[Caroline Kennedy]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and the candidate's spouse, [[Michelle Obama]].<ref>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/maria-shriver-backs-obama/ Maria Shriver Backs Obama]</ref><ref>[http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/CPcT Breaking: California First Lady Maria Shriver Endorses Barack Obama]</ref> Her husband had previously endorsed Senator [[John McCain]] for the Republican Presidential nomination a few days earlier on [[January 31]], [[2008]].

==Honors==
A type of rose was named after Shriver in October [[2004]]. The Maria Shriver rose has starchy-white blooms and a powerful citrus fragrance.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041017/news_1hs17maria.html Rose named in honor of Maria Shriver]</ref>
