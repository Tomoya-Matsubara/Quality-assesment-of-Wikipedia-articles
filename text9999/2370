'''''HoiHoi-san''''', full title {{Nihongo|'''''Ichigeki Sacchu!! HoiHoi-san'''''|<U+4E00><U+6483><U+6BBA><U+866B>!!<U+30DB><U+30A4><U+30DB><U+30A4><U+3055><U+3093>|One-Shot Bug Killer!! Interceptor Doll HoiHoi-san}}, is a [[PlayStation 2]] game, [[manga]] series, and ten minute [[Original Video Animation|OVA]].  In the year 20XX, insects have become immune to all [[pesticide]]s.  To combat the rising plague of [[cockroach]]es and other household [[pest (animal)|pest]]s, the tiny, doll-like extermination [[android]]s known as "Hoihoi-san" were created.  They can hunt down insects and kill them with such miniaturized [[weapon]]s as minuscule [[machine gun]]s and tiny combat [[knives]].  They can also (and at the same time) be treated as [[doll]]s, by dressing them up in costumes and buying [[accessories]] for them. The main robot of the [[anime]] wears a maid uniform and rabbit ears as accessories.

==History==
This started out as a game for the [[PS2|Playstation 2]] but has since branched out into numerous other media channels. The setting is in year 20XX at a time when insects are immune to all insecticides, so Japanese pharmaceutical companies have had to come up with the next level in insect extermination: small but heavily armed robots.

Hoihoi-san is the bug killing robot of the title, a 10.5 cm tall doll like robot that comes with a wide range of weapons. With this character a new level has been attained in the girls-with-guns genre: capable of an impressive rate of fire, handles a sword equally well, is dressed up very cutely, complete with bowties and booties and an expressionless face.

The Hoihoi-san series of products parodies the girls-with-guns genre, robot girls as companions and the [[otaku]]s.

==The game==
The game, released 2003-11-27, is a third person shooter game where the main aim is to complete levels defeating hordes of various kinds of insects, all while avoiding collateral damage to furniture and other household items. Completing a level gives you credits with which you can buy upgrades for your Hoihoi-san, ranging from the useful like missile packs, ammunition and weapons upgrade but also less useful items like new clothing and new voices.

In the game the muzzle blast is about the size of the robot, which combined with an impressive rate of fire makes for a definite statement in the girls-with-guns genre. A modicum of style, finesse and Japanese tradition is retained by [http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/hoihoisan/picture/hoi_wall01l.jpg featuring] a [[katana]] in the weapons selection. The game allows the player to use both a katana and a machine gun at the same time.

If the player acquires all Hoihoi-san accessories, the backdrop turns pink on returning home, possibly to display the newly attained level of otakuness.

==The manga==
A series of single page [[Manga]], serialised in Monthly Dengeki Daioh from 2004-09-30, were made (art by [[Tanaka Kunihiko]]), centered around the life of Aburatsubo-kun and his Hoihoi-san in Kyoto.
*'''ID-3 Hoihoi-san''' (<U+30DB><U+30A4><U+30DB><U+30A4><U+3055><U+3093>), a line of insect exterminating robots made by Maazu Pharmaceuticals.  The designation "ID-3" stands for <b>I<b>nterceptor <b>D</b>oll (Version) <b>3</b>.
*'''Aburatsubo-kun''' (<U+6CB9><U+58F7>), a lonely otaku whose only company is the Hoihoi-san that he dotes and spend his money on.
*'''Dewa Kimiko-chan''' (<U+51FA><U+7FBD><U+304D><U+307F><U+5B50>, ''Dewa Kimiko''), works in a Kyoto pharmacy frequented by Aburatsubo-kun, selling bug killing robots and accessories. She wants a robot doll but cannot stomach the carnage.
*'''Mutsumi "Mu-chan" Fushikawa''', friend of Kimiko-chan.
*'''Owner''', owner of the pharmacy.
*'''Furuyashiki-san''' (<U+53E4><U+5C4B><U+6577>), works at Maazu Pharmaceuticals, proponent of odd Hoihoi-san upgrades.
*'''Yazaki-kun''' (<U+77E2><U+5D0E>), works for Furuyashiki-san.
*'''RRX-7.8 Combat-san''' (<U+30B3><U+30F3><U+30D0><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+3055><U+3093>), a line of insect extermination robots created by Kinryu.

The manga follows up in the bizarreness with lines like
*"The spare ammunition kit is sold out, huh? I suppose I'll just buy her a pair of gloves."
*While a life sized Hoihoi-san is levelling Aburatsubo-kun's flat, on the telephone: "It's on a rampage? I know that already!!"

==The anime==
The manga and the [[Original Video Animation]] were part of a special edition package. The anime itself is only about 10 minutes long and maintains the unusual humor by combining massive gunplay with squeeky booties.

==The doll==
An articulated doll was produced, in a limited edition, that in the spirit of the rest of the venture features numerous weapons and shields. Due to laws in Japan the doll does not fire live ammunition, neither from the machine gun, nor from the missile launcher, so the company regretted lack of insecticidal effect. The dress can still be customised.

==The dress demo==
To complete it all a demo was made in Shockwave Flash that can be used to demonstrate numerous Hoihoi-san outfits.

==Influences==
A number of background images were made and one of them [http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/hoihoisan/picture/hoi_wall04l.jpg shows] Hoihoi-san falling backwards while firing guns, one in each hand, in a pose and rate of fire that is very similar to that of Trinity in [[The Matrix Reloaded]] shown in the trailer.

Anime News Network [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4507&page=22] reports that ''Combat-san's model number, RRX-7.8, is probably a parody of the original Mobile Suit Gundam RX-78.''
