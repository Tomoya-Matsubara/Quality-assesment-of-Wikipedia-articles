'''Jeremy Brett''' ([[3 November]], [[1933]] <U+2013> [[12 September]], [[1995]]), born '''Peter Jeremy William Huggins''',  was an [[England|English]] [[actor]] famous for his portrayal of the detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] in three [[UK|British]] [[television series]] ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (TV series)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', The Return of Sherlock Holmes, and The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes.

==Early life==
Brett was born at Berkswell Grange in [[Berkswell]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]] and was educated at [[Eton College]]. Brett later claimed that he was an "academic disaster" at Eton and attributed his learning difficulties to [[dyslexia]]. However, he excelled at singing and was a member of the college choir.

==Acting career==
Brett trained as an actor at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in [[London]].<ref>''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 17th ed. Gale Research, 1981.</ref> He made his professional acting debut at the [[Library Theatre]] in [[Manchester]] in 1954, and made his London stage debut with the [[Old Vic]] company in ''Troilus and Cressida'' 1956. <ref> ''Some Joe You Don't Know: An American Biographical Guide to 100 British Television Personalities'', by Anthony Slide, Greenwood Press, 1996</ref>. In the same year he appeared on Broadway as the Duke of Aumerle in ''Richard II''.<ref> Contemporary Theatre, Film, and Television, Volume 15. GALE, 1996</ref> He went on to play many classical roles on stage, including numerous [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] parts in his early career with the [[Old Vic]] and later with the [[Royal National Theatre]]. Brett made his first television appearance in 1954 and his first feature film appearance in 1955. 

He was briefly considered by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] for the role of [[James Bond]] in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' after [[Sean Connery]] quit the series in 1967, but the role went to Australian [[George Lazenby]] instead. A second audition for the role of 007 for ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' was also unsuccessful as [[Roger Moore]] won the coveted part.

From the early 1960s, Brett was rarely absent from British television screens. He starred in many serials, notably as [[D'Artagnan]] in the 1966 adaptation of ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''.  A few of his appearances were in comedic roles, but usually with a classic edge, such as Captain Absolute in ''[[The Rivals]]''.  In 1973, Brett portrayed Bassanio in a televised production  of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', in which [[Laurence Olivier]] portrayed [[Shylock]] and [[Joan Plowright]] Portia. (Brett, Olivier and Plowright had previously played the same roles in a [[Royal National Theatre]] production of the play.) Brett joked that, as an actor, he was rarely allowed into the [[20th century]] and ''never'' into the present day.

Although Brett's feature film appearances were relatively few, he did play Freddie Eynsford-Hill in the 1964 blockbuster film version of ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. His singing voice was dubbed in the film, but Brett could still sing, as he later proved when he played Danilo in ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' on British television in 1968. 

Notable in all of Jeremy Brett's roles is his precisely honed diction. Brett was born with a speech impediment that kept him from [[rhotacism|pronouncing the "R" sound correctly]]. Corrective surgery as a teenager, followed by years of practising, gave Brett an enviable pronunciation and enunciation.  He later claimed he practised all of his speech exercises daily, whether he was working or not.

Although he appeared in many different roles during his 40-year career, Brett is now best remembered for portraying [[Sherlock Holmes]] in the 1984<U+2013>94 series of [[Granada Television]] films, adapted by John Hawkesworth and other writers from the original stories by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] (see ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (TV series)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'').  Even though he reportedly feared being typecast, Brett appeared in 41 episodes of the Granada series.  After taking on the demanding role, Brett made few other acting appearances and he is now widely considered to be the definitive Holmes of his era, just as [[Basil Rathbone]] was during the 1940s.  Interestingly, Brett had played [[Doctor Watson]] on stage opposite [[Charlton Heston]] as Holmes in the 1980 Los Angeles production of ''[[The Crucifer of Blood]]'', making him one of only three actors to play both Holmes and Watson professionally (the other two are [[Reginald Owen]] and [[Patrick Macnee]]).{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

==Illnesses and death==
Brett suffered from [[bipolar disorder]] (commonly known as manic depression), which worsened after the death of his second wife, Joan Wilson, on July 4, 1985. She died shortly after Brett finished filming Holmes<U+2019> "death" in ''[[The Adventure of the Final Problem|The Final Problem]]''.  He took a break from filming the ''Holmes'' series. When he returned to film new episodes in 1986, however, grief and the stressful shooting schedule aggravated his disorder. "Holmes was threatening me. He became the dark side of the moon because he is moody and solitary and I am sociable and gregarious. It got dangerous for me." <ref> ''Some Joe You Don't Know: An American Biographical Guide to 100 British Television Personalities'', by Anthony Slide, Greenwood Press, 1996</ref> He suffered a full-blown manic depressive crisis and was hospitalized.  During the last decade of his life, Brett was treated in hospital several times for his mental illness, and his health and appearance visibly deteriorated by the time he completed the later episodes of the '' Sherlock Holmes'' series.  [[Mel Gussow]] wrote in a ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary "Mr. Brett was regarded as the quintessential Holmes: breathtakingly analytical, given to outrageous disguises and the blackest moods and relentless in his enthusiasm for solving the most intricate crimes." <ref>New York Times, September 14, 1995, p. B15</ref>

There were plans to film all the Holmes stories, but Brett died of [[heart failure]] at his London home before the project could be completed. Brett's heart had been damaged by a childhood case of [[rheumatic fever]] and was apparently further weakened by his heavy smoking. In an interview, [[Edward Hardwicke]] (the second actor to play [[Dr. Watson]] in Brett's ''Holmes'' series) claimed that Brett would buy 60 cigarettes on his way to the set and smoke them all throughout the day. After his heart problem was diagnosed, Brett reportedly quit smoking for a short while, but began smoking again shortly before his death at the age of 61 on [[September 12]], [[1995]].

Jeremy Brett's final, posthumous on-screen credit was as the "Artist's Father" in ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', with [[Robin Wright Penn]] in the title role. This American feature film (not to be confused with the ITV adaptation starring [[Alex Kingston]]) was released in the summer of 1996, nearly a year after Brett's death.

==Family==
In [[1958]], Brett married the [[actor|actress]] [[Anna Massey]] (daughter of [[Raymond Massey]]), but they divorced in 1962.  Their son, [[David Huggins]], born in 1959, is now a successful British cartoonist, illustrator and novelist.  Years later, Brett and Massey appeared together in the [[BBC]]'s dramatization of ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' (1978), with Brett playing the haunted hero, Max de Winter, and Massey playing the sinister housekeeper, Mrs Danvers. (David Huggins also played an uncredited bit part in the film.)  In 1977 Brett married American [[PBS]] producer [[Joan Wilson]], but she died of [[cancer]] in 1985. Brett was devastated by Wilson's death and did not marry again.  Brett was related to another noted British actor, [[Martin Clunes]] (of ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]'' fame); Clunes' mother was Brett's first cousin.
