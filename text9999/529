'''''Chris Ryan's Strike Back''''' is a six-part [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television series]] based on the novel of the same name written by best-selling author and former soldier of the [[Special Air Service]], [[Chris Ryan]]. It was produced by [[Left Bank Pictures]] for [[Sky1]]. The cast of ''Strike Back'' is led by [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] and [[Andrew Lincoln]], also starring [[Orla Brady]], [[Shelley Conn]], [[Colin Salmon]] and [[Jodhi May]], including a variety of guest appearances including [[Toby Stephens]], [[Ewen Bremner]], [[Dhaffer L'Abidine]], [[Shaun Parkes]] and [[Alexander Siddig]]. The series follows John Porter (Armitage), a former British [[Special Forces]] soldier, who is drafted back into service by Section 20 of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6).

The series ran on a multi-million [[Pound sterling|pound]] budget, and was filmed on location in [[South Africa]], particularly in the [[Gauteng|Province of Gauteng]]. Ryan became a series consultant. ''Strike Back'' commenced airing on 5 May 2010 with two episodes showing a week. The first episode received unofficial overnight ratings of 400,000 viewers in the United Kingdom, which increased to 1 million according to the more official [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]. It was met with generally positive reviews; comments of the series ranged from a positive "British action series that packs a ''[[Die Hard]]''-style thrill around every corner," to a more negative "pathetic male fantasy". It was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on 7 June 2010.

==Series overview==
The series takes place in a six-episode format. It follows the actions of John Porter ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]), a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Sergeant, and Hugh Collinson ([[Andrew Lincoln]]), a Section 20 officer in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6). Both of them took part in a botched operation on the eve of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] where two soldiers in their unit were killed. The series is divided on three main story lines that took place seven years later. The first two episodes focus on the kidnap of Katie Dartmouth ([[Orla Brady]]), a British journalist, outside [[Basra]], [[Iraq]]. Porter is redrafted to rescue her. The next two episodes takes place in [[Zimbabwe]], where the Government accuses the UK of orchestrating the assassination plot of [[Robert Mugabe]]; Porter is to enter the same prison the apparent shooter is being held and aids in breaking out. The last two episodes take place in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], where a [[computer hacker]] is responsible for killing several American troops in [[Helmand Province]]. A loose arc also takes place during the series concerning who killed the soldiers.<ref name=pressrelease/>

==Cast and characters==
[[File:Richard Armitage BAFTA 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] portrays series protagonist, John Porter.]]
[[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] plays series protagonist John Porter. Porter served in the SAS until he was [[military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonourably discharged]] after he saved a boy who was believed to have murdered two soldiers in his unit following a rescue operation the night before the Iraq invasion. He is later brought back into service by Section 20 seven years later. He is married to Diane, and has a daughter, Alexandra. Armitage described Porter as a "damaged hero",<ref name="brady/armitage sky">{{cite journal |year=2010 |month=May |title=Insider: Dangerous Liaisons |journal=[[Sky Magazine]] |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]] |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> and "sort of like [[Lucas North]], only on some kind of go-faster drug."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grant, Olly |year=2010 |month=April |title=Tough Guy Richard |journal=[[TVTimes]] |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> In order to fit in to the role, Armitage had to "bulk up for the role,"<ref name="sun interview"/> and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to [[Johannesburg]] the day after filming the eighth series of ''[[Spooks]]'' wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training.<ref name="screenrush"/> He was trained from "how to hold a gun to how you can run through a door without getting your head blown off."<ref name="sun interview">{{cite journal |year=2010 |month=April |title=Richard's on Strike! |journal=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] |publisher=[[News International]] |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating "filming ''Spooks'' is demanding, but nowhere near as physical as this."<ref name="brady/armitage sky"/> Armitage performed most of his own stunts.<ref name="screenrush">{{cite news |last=Philips |first=Emily |date=29 April 2010 |url=http://www.screenrush.co.uk/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18496997.html |title=Richard Armitage Talks Strike Back |work=screenrush.co.uk |publisher=Screen Rush |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

[[Andrew Lincoln]] plays Hugh Collinson, former soldier in Porter's unit and has since become the head of Section 20. Lincoln was signed onto the role because he thought the series was a "great story", and that his character was "completely re-written from the book." Out of the cast, the weapons instructor told Lincoln that he was the most instinctive he ever worked with.<ref name="metro.co.uk">{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Keith |date=4 May 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/824412-chris-ryans-strike-back-interview |title=Chris Ryan's Strike Back: War blockbuster explodes myths |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]] |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

[[Orla Brady]] plays Katie Dartmouth, a British [[war correspondent]] who was kidnapped in [[Basra]] by the "Sword of Islam", an Iraqi terrorist group. To play Dartmouth, Brady used her inspiration from real life [[BBC]] war correspontant [[Orla Guerin]]. During the filming of Dartmouth's holding, a male stand-in with a [[wig]] was used as a stunt double.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hendry |first=Steve |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/144418606 |title=Other man in my life; Orla Brady reveals her stand-in in military drama Strike Back is a big, burly South African guy in a wig |work=californiachronicle.com |publisher=California Chronicle |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> The crew also added oil and dirt on Brady's hair every morning. Brady stated that she liked playing extremes, and thought Dartmouth is "grown up" compared to Siobhan Dhillion, the character Brady portrayed in ''[[Mistresses (2008 TV series)|Mistresses]]''.<ref name="brady/armitage sky"/>

[[Shelley Conn]] plays Danni Prendiville, an officer with Section 20. Porter started an [[affair]] with her after he was redrafted into service. She signed on for the role because she "thought the concept of the scripts was very clever and once I heard who was involved it didn't take me long to sign up." In researching for her role, Conn had somewhat of a military background since her father and uncle both served in the [[British Army]], and had since had a base understanding of military life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sky1.sky.com/strike-back-characters-danni-prendiville |title=Strike Back: Shelley Conn on Danni Prendiville |work=sky1.sky.com |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]] |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

[[Colin Salmon]] plays James Middleton, a [[civil service|civil servant]] who sits between the British government and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on ''[[Hex (TV series)|Hex]]''. He was attracted to the role in ''Strike Back'' due to the script being "a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to sit down to start reading something and then not be able to stop because you have to know what's going to happen next," as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of [[The Prince's Trust]] charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in [[Soweto]] while the series was filmed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sky1.sky.com/strike-back-characters-james-middleton |title=Strike Back: Colin Salmon on James Middleton |work=sky1.sky.com |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]] |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

[[Jodhi May]] plays Layla Thompson, a lieutenant in [[military intelligence]] and works alongside Collinson in Section 20. At first, she came to resent Porter, but starts opening up to him after she grows some distrust towards Collinson. May described Thompson as an "incredibly challenging, assertive and ambitious woman working in a male-dominated field that she's climbed to the top of." She was drawn into appear in the series because of the respect she has with [[Andy Harries]] and Left Bank Productions. May knew people who work in the same world her character does, and talked with them to conduct some research into her role, as well as reading on the subject.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sky1.sky.com/layla-thompson |title=Strike Back: Jodhi May on Layla Thompson |work=sky1.sky.com |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]] |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>

The series was also given a variety of guest appearances. Among them include [[Nicola Stephenson]] (Diane Porter), [[Laura Greenwood]] (Alexandra Porter), Fenar Mohammed Ali (As'ad), [[Dhaffer L'Abidine]] (Hakin Al Nazeri), [[Shaun Parkes]] (Felix Masuku), [[David Harewood]] (Colonel Tshuma), [[Toby Stephens]] (Frank Arlington) and [[Alexander Siddig]] (Zahar Sharq).<ref name=pressrelease/>

==Production==
[[File:South-Africa Johannesburg Botanical Garden-009.jpg|thumb|The series was filmed on location in and around [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].]]
The series was commissioned by Elaine Pyke, the Head of Drama for Sky.<ref name=pressrelease>{{cite web |url=http://www.skypressoffice.co.uk/SkyOne/news/showarticle.asp?id=2942&month=3&year=2010 |title=Sky 1 Press release; Chris Ryan's Strike Back |date=March 2010 |accessdate=8 May, 2010 |work=skypressoffice.co.uk |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]]}}</ref> Pyke and executive producer [[Andy Harries]] had enthusiasm for the novel the series was based on, and were excited to take up the challenge to adapt the novel for television. It was planned to be shot in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] because, according to Pyke; "Sky1 HD drama is about trying to astound audiences, up the creative bar, and commission shows which make audiences love being Sky subscribers." After seeing the success from previous dramas such as ''[[Terry Pratchett's Hogfather]]'' and ''[[The Take (TV series)|The Take]]'', Sky made a multi-million pound commitment to ''Strike Back''.<ref name="guardian1">{{cite news |last=Holmwood |first=Leigh |date=24 Aug 2009 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/aug/24/sky-one-chris-ryan-strike-back |title=This Life's Andrew Lincoln to star in Sky1 adaptation of Strike Back |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>

Harries commented that he "was interested in developing a quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't." Richard Armitage called the series an "ambitious project for television. But the advantage of that is that these three feature films are linked together so you get a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this is stepping into that area." Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, [[Chris Ryan]], served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; "When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience. I class myself as a storyteller now, and to tell that story on paper is a great privilege, then to see it on screen is even better."<ref name=pressrelease/> In addition, three ex-SAS soldiers taught the cast weapons and tactical training.<ref name="screenrush"/>

Filming commenced on August 2009,<ref name="guardian1"/> and concluded by the end of the same year. It was filmed on location primarily in the Johannesburg area in [[South Africa]], as well as the same Province the city is located, [[Gauteng]].<ref name="gauteng.co.za>{{cite news |url=http://www.gautengfilm.co.za/live/content.php?Item_ID=942 |title=''Strike Back'' shoots in Jozi |work=gauteng.co.za |publisher=Gauteng Film Commission |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> Other filming locations in the series include [[Northern Cape]], [[Augrabies Falls National Park]],<ref name="localemaninterview">{{cite web |url=http://tv.sky.com/strike-back-interview-location-manager |title=Strike Back Interview: Location Manager |accessdate=22 May 2010 |work=Sky.com |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]]}}</ref> and the [[Kalahari Desert]].<ref name="snakeshalt">{{cite journal |year=2010 |month=January |title=Richard Armitage Braves Killer Snakes For Strike Back! |journal=[[Sky Magazine]] |publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]] |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>

One of the biggest problems for filming is the environmental impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local [[police]] and the local [[hospital]]. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities.<ref name="localemaninterview"/> The action sequences in the beginning of the first episode took five days to shoot,<ref name="metro.co.uk"/> and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]]. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous [[snake]]s in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.<ref name="snakeshalt"/>

Overall, the reviews of the series were generally positive. Michael Conroy of ''[[GQ]]'' named ''Strike Back'' an "Editor's Pick" for its "excellent cinematography, stellar performances and a surprisingly balanced global perspective makes this story of two former British SAS soldiers a thoroughly enjoyable action romp."

''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' have each released two separate reviews; they were more mixed. Sam Wollaston enjoyed the first two episodes, but called it a "pathetic male fantasy."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/may/06/chris-ryans-strike-back-review |title=Chris Ryan's Strike Back and Timothy Spall: Somewhere at Sea |first=Sam |last=Wollaston |date=6 May, 2010 |accessdate=8 May, 2010 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref> Andrew Anthony has said that "no scene lasted more than about 25 seconds in the first two episodes and no element of plot information was left unspoken.

 |ShortSummary = After finding a "Sword of Islam" member, Porter persuades him to lead him to where Dartmouth is being held, and then allows himself to be captured. After finding and removing a tracking device on one of his teeth, the terrorists move both hostages to another location. Later, they decide to execute Dartmouth one day sooner after realising the British will not give into their demand. Porter breaks free and kills most of the kidnappers, whilst As'ad kills the leader, and wishes to join them, claiming he knows who killed the soldiers seven years ago. While the trio are pursued by re-enforcements during their escape, the extraction team arrive. Collinson refuses As'ad entry into the helicopter, who is last seen running for his life. When Porter questions Dartmouth about what As'ad said about who killed the soldiers, Dartmouth recalls that it was a British soldier; it is revealed the killer is Collinson.
