"'''The Movie'''" is the fifty-fourth episode of the sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''. It is the 14th episode of the fourth season, and first aired on January 6, 1993.

==Plot==
[[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] schedules two stand-up acts in the same night and afterwards goes to the [[movie theater]] to meet everyone. [[George Costanza|George]] gets in the wrong line for tickets, and soon goes with [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] and [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] to another theater to see the movie ''Checkmate''. Kramer waits outside for Jerry but also wants a [[Papaya King]] hot dog. Jerry misses his first show and discovers his spot was taken by an annoying comedian, who then accompanies Jerry back to the theater to tell George, Elaine, and Kramer that he won't be able to see the movie with them, but discovers they aren't there. Meanwhile, Elaine struggles to save seats for everyone, and George runs afoul with an usher. Jerry then misses his second show after being delayed by his taxi driver. 

Through a comedy of errors, everyone (but Kramer) misses the movie they were originally going to see and end up in "Rochelle, Rochelle".
