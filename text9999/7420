'''Zoe Carpenter''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Zo<U+00EB> Lister]]. The character first appeared on-screen on 1 September 2006, as one of three new students at [[Hollyoaks Community College]]. It was announced in 2009 that Lister had quit her role in order to pursue other projects; she subsequently left the series in January 2010. During Zoe's time in ''Hollyoaks'' she has been portrayed as a bubbly [[tomboy]] who often makes the wrong choices in life and has had a number of failed relationships.

Zoe has been involved in storylines including being stalked, entering a relationship with an older man, having sexual relations with her female best friend, being wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of [[Sarah Barnes]] and the being victim of a stabbing. Lister's portrayal saw her nominated for the "Sexiest Female" award at the 2009 [[British Soap Awards]], and also attracted critical praise for her exit storyline.

===Casting===
Actress and dancer Zo<U+00EB> Lister was cast in the role of Zoe.<ref name="official"/> On 8 June 2009, media entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave towards the end of the year.<ref name="zoequits">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a158892/zoe-lister-quits-hollyoaks.html |title=Zo<U+00EB> Lister quits 'Hollyoaks' |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris |last=Green|date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref> Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: "It's scary but also very, very exciting.

Almost a year after filming her final scenes, Lister explained that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: "It felt it was time to go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, I was nervous but now I know I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [''Hollyoaks''] was the break I'd been praying for. I threw myself into the part and enjoyed every minute of it.

===Characterisation===
Zoe is a former student at [[Hollyoaks Community College]], where she studied [[Film theory|Film Studies]]. Channel 4 publicity describe Zoe as "the bubbly student" and make note of her many bad choices in life and failed relationships.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/girls/zoecarpenter.html|title=Zoe Carpenter (played by Zoe Lister)|work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]]|publisher=([[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television Corporation]])|author=|date=November 2009|accessdate=2010-02-26<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9CIxBXl|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> Discussing these failed relationships, Lister commented during an interview in June 2009 that she believed her character was having a break from men in order to sort out her problems: "I think she's been in and out of so many relationships and her life is at a bit of a juncture; she probably needs to sort her head out, sort her career, knuckle down really and not get bogged down into a relationship because everything takes a backseat when you're in one."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/wdp/entertainment/Zoe-Carpenter-loves-single-life/article-1110635-detail/article.html|title=Zoe Carpenter loves single life|work=[[Bristol Evening Post]]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|date=25 June 2009|accessdate=2010-01-29<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9CLUIHC|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> 

Zoe is also portrayed as having a [[tomboy]] persona.<ref name="maxim"/> Lister was asked about this "tomboy" personality during an interview with [[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] magazine, agreeing with the label and stating her character doesn't "glam up" as much as the other ''Hollyoaks'' characters.<ref name="maxim">{{cite news|url=http://www.maxim.co.uk/girls/celebrity/6011/zoe_lister.html|title=Zo<U+00EB> Lister <U+2013> Wowee Zo<U+00EB>!|work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing|Dennis Publishing Ltd]]|year=2009|accessdate=2010-01-29<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9COmsrF|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> Maxim also noted the character was "pretty popular with the boys".<ref name="maxim"/> Lister has also commented that her character is not a stereotypical dizzy blonde, reiterated her character's tomboy status and added that she is a "very street-smart type of woman."<ref name="tony zoe">{{cite news|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/posts/view/2755/Zoe-Lister-and-Tony-Hirst-|title=Zoe Lister and Tony Hirst|work=[[OK!|OK!

===Early storylines===
One of Zoe's first and main storylines was being stalked by fellow student [[Will Hackett]] (Oliver Farnworth). Lister later commented on the storyline, deciding it was her most memorable: "The most memorable for me was the one with my weird boyfriend Will who stalked me. Like I said, it was a bit weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/hollyoaks/news/zoe-listers-favourite-storyline-349|title=Zo<U+00EB> Lister's favourite storyline|publisher=[[Five (TV channel)|Five]]|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=2010-01-29<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9CaZAuj|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur (who plays [[Leila Roy]]), Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/tv-news/273980/hollyoaks-stars-lena-kaur-and-zoe-lister-promote-fire-safety/1/|title=Hollyoaks stars Lena Kaur and Zo<U+00EB> Lister promote fire safety|work=[[NOW (British magazine)|NOW Magazine]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=2010-01-29<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9CdIbUf|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref>

In early 2008 during an interview with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Lister expressed her feelings on the subject of lesbian storylines, stating: "I'd definitely do a lesbian love scene in ''Hollyoaks''. That would be a really good story."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a83596/hollyoaks-star-wants-corrie-lesbian-plot.html|title=Hollyoaks star wants Corrie lesbian plot|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=7 January 2008|accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1087048/Lesbian-love-scene-spices-Hollyoaks-drunken-friends-Zoe-Sarah-end-bed.html|title=Hollyoaks spices things up as model Sarah has lesbian affair with dad's girlfriend Zoe|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers|Associated Newspapers Ltd]]|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=2010-01-29<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9CgQCO5|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series ''[[Hollyoaks Later]]''. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui <U+2014> it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.girlactionevents.com/newsview.php?id=13|title=Hollyoaks star Zoe Lister talks of lesbian scene|publisher=Girl Action Events|year=2009|accessdate=2010-01-29<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9CjhemW|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [Batley] and I chatted a lot when we found out that it was going to be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine."<ref name="oaks worried">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a138535/oaks-zoe-worried-over-lesbian-scenes.html|title='Oaks Zoe worried over lesbian scenes|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=30 November 2008|accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref> She continued: "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we were! We were kind of ignored for the day."<ref name="oaks worried"/>

Speaking to entertainment news website [[Digital Spy]] about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: "I don't think they do have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience <U+2014> one of those things that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah <U+2014> it's purely a deep friendship."<ref name="duo reflect">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a179996/hollyoaks-duo-reflect-on-lesbian-plot.html|title=Hollyoaks duo reflect on lesbian plot|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref> Meanwhile, Batley said: "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had <U+2014> a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more <U+2014> she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well."<ref name="duo reflect"/>

After the announcement of Lister's departure, it was that revealed [[Loui Batley]], who played [[Sarah Barnes]], would also leave the show in a tragic [[skydiving]] death, caused by a jealous [[Lydia Hart]] (Lydia Kelly).<ref name="skydive">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a171715/tragic-skydive-death-for-hollyoaks-later.html |title=Tragic skydive death for Hollyoaks Later |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris |last=Green |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-26}}</ref> Before the skydiving plot aired, Lister explained the storyline during an interview with Sky TV, stating that at the time Lydia severed a parachute to end her own life, later deciding to cut Zoe's parachute so she could have Sarah to herself, further explaining that viewers were not permitted to know who would have parachute after they became mixed up in the storyline's dramatic twist.<ref name="sky">{{cite news|url=http://tv.sky.com/hollyoaks-interview-zoe-lister|title=Hollyoaks interview: Zo<U+00EB> Lister|work=[[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky.com]]|publisher=[[British Sky Broadcasting]]|date=November 2009|accessdate=2010-01-29<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9CnkfAk|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> Speaking on how Zoe's relationship with Sarah causes Lydia to commit her actions, Lister stated: 

{{cquote|Zoe's not always been a great friend, for example this year she plagiarised Sarah's dad's script to use as her degree project and that revealed a lot about Sarah's history and her life. It's not been great but there's a lot of love there between them. Zoe's not a lesbian, it was a bit of an experimental phase, but Sarah will always hang on to that. So when Lydia turns up, Sarah obviously has a bit of thing for Zoe and Lydia just can't take it and starts going mental.<ref name="sky"/>}}

Lister explained that she and her fellow cast members filmed on many locations, including army barracks.<ref name="sky"/> She also revealed that she was the only cast member out of her, Batley and Kelly who performed the aired skydiving for real.<ref name="sky"/> A ''Hollyoaks'' producer released two pictures of funeral wreaths, one reading 'Zoe' and the other 'Sarah', in order to confuse viewers further as to whom the victim would be.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a173953/hollyoaks-later-parachute-death-revealed.html|title='Hollyoaks Later' parachute death revealed?|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Green, Kris|date=26 August 2009|accessdate=2010-02-26}}</ref> On-screen after the skydive and Sarah's subsequent death, Lydia framed Zoe for the murder she committed, leading to her arrest.

Speaking of Sarah's death and Zoe's false imprisonment, Lister stated: "She's in a very difficult place. She's lost her best friend and there's so much history there and she's finished her degree <U+2014> well she didn't even finish her degree, she failed that <U+2014> so she's in a limbo land anyway. She's working silly jobs and she's not in a very good place at all in any aspect of her life. Oh, and she's in prison on suspicion of murder..."<ref name="zlister"/> When asked during another interview with Digital Spy about how the character is coping with being in prison, Lister stated: "Not very well! It's all completely overwhelming for her. She can't get her head around the fact that her best friend's dead and the fact that she's being accused of murdering her is ridiculous. She's worried that because it's got this far its ludicrous, so who's to say that she won't be sent down?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a188155/zoe-lister-zoe-carpenter-hollyoaks.html|title=INTERVIEW: Zo<U+00EB> Lister (Zoe Carpenter, 'Hollyoaks')|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=2009-11-31}}</ref>

When the character was ultimately found not guilty and was released, Lister stated in an interview with [[E4 (channel)|E4]]: "I think this is a great storyline, I've really enjoyed doing it. When Zoe's obviously released, it's like a whole new scenario for her because there are people who haven't really trusted her or believed in her. People that have really let her down, and plus the fact she hasn't got over Sarah [...] being killed yet either. She hasn't had the chance to deal with that, so that's really interesting, and she still wants Lydia to go down!"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.e4.com/video/lf6EuRC7vCzIPhYU7I9VEm/play.e4|title=Watch video - Zo<U+00EB> Lister interview|work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]]|publisher=[[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television Corporation]]|date=3 December 2009|accessdate=2010-01-01<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9Crp6UB|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref> The character of Zoe then set out to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. She befriended her, and even seduced her in order to gain a confession. During an interview about Zoe's new scheme, Lister said: 

{{cquote|[She] can't let Mike continue to think that Sarah killed herself because it must be awful for a parent to continue thinking that about their child. Zoe wants justice, especially as Lydia <U+2014> Sarah's real murderer <U+2014> is living with Mike! Zoe decides that the only way she can sort everything out is to befriend Lydia and elicit a confession out of her. She doesn't really have a clue what she's doing, but she wants to get a confession out of Lydia. She can't go to the police because they've closed the case, so Zoe takes matters into her own hands."<ref name="scheme">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a190988/lister-oaks-storyline-gets-really-messy.html|title=Lister: 'Oaks storyline gets really messy|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Kilkelly, Daniel and Green, Kris|date=29 December 2009|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>}}

Lister continued, "It all gets really messy from here! Because Lydia's really deranged, Lydia starts thinking that because she loved Sarah and Sarah loved Zoe, if she gets with Zoe, that'll be the final piece in the puzzle and it'll all work out."<ref name="scheme"/> She explained: "Lydia starts becoming obsessed with Zoe and to keep control, Zoe has to go with it.

Lydia discovered Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, and set out to take revenge. In a second interview with E4, Lister stated: "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." She continued: "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night.

When Archie destroys Zoe's film project, essential for her graduation, lecturer [[Adrian Kennedy (Hollyoaks)|Adrian P. Kennedy]] (Richard Lawrence) gives her an extension. Zoe finds a script belonging to Mike which he wrote 20 years ago about his decision to give Sarah up for adoption. Zoe uses the script and films it, and Adrian screens it in the SU Bar. At the screening, Sarah discovers the planned adoption and is in turmoil. Mike goes to see Adrian to tell him of the plagiarism. Adrian says that if she sleeps with him, he will not tell the university. Zoe considers Adrian's offer but later claims she would rather be a failure than sleep with him, leading to him failing her project. Zoe then has a brief relationship with [[Natty (Hollyoaks)|Natty]] (Danny Tennant).

Zoe goes on an parachute jump with [[Fernando Fernandez (Hollyoaks)|Fernando Fernandez]] (Jeronimo Best), [[Steph Cunningham]] ([[Carley Stenson]]), Gilly and Sarah.

That night, Sarah and Zoe get drunk and return to their tent, where Sarah makes a pass at Zoe. Sarah reveals that whilst she had not intended to kiss her, Zoe was the only person she had ever been able to rely upon. Zoe and Sarah later discover Lydia's lies and Sarah decides to end their relationship for good during a discussion with Zoe. Lydia overhears the conversation and sabotages Zoe's parachute before the jump in an attempt to kill her.

Zoe moves in with Mike and Lydia, and tells Lydia that her feelings towards her have changed. The pair share a kiss, just as Mike and Amy walk in. Mike then tells Zoe to leave.

==Reception==
In 2008, Lister's role as Zoe saw her nominated for the "Sexiest Female" award at [[The British Soap Awards]], however she lost to co-star [[Roxanne McKee]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94815/the-british-soap-awards-2008-the-winners.html|title=The British Soap Awards 2008: The Winners|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=2009-07-06}}</ref> Lister was asked in an interview if she was disappointed to not win the award. She replied: "Not at all! It was lovely to be nominated, and also a bit hilarious, but beyond that, I wasn't desperate to win. I really wasn't bothered! I was more than happy that Roxanne [McKee] won it <U+2014> and I guessed she might do anyway."<ref name="tony zoe"/> When Zoe's affair with [[Mike Barnes (Hollyoaks)|Mike Barnes]] ([[Tony Hirst]]) began, there was some controversy over the storyline, due to the age gap between the pair. However, Hirst stated: "I think the controversy has subsided somewhat. It's not an illicit affair, it's known about now. It was shocking to some people at the beginning but it wasn't by any means illegal. There were some complications but they are both grown-ups!"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.myparkmag.co.uk/articles/television/hollyoaks/tony-hirsts-monkey-scene.html|title=Tony Hirst's monkey scene|work=My Park Magazine|date=28 August 2008|accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref> The parachute stunt won 'Spectacular Scene Of The Year' at the 2010 British Soap Awards.<ref name="soapawrds">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a218909/enders-cleans-up-at-british-soap-awards.html|title='Enders cleans up at British Soap Awards|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Kilkelly, Daniel|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref> At the 2010 [[Inside Soap Awards]] the storyline gained nominations in the category of "Best Stunt".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a242852/in-full-inside-soap-awards-2010-nominees.html|title=In Full: Inside Soap Awards 2010 Nominees|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|date=2010-07-13|first=Catriona|last=Wightman|accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref> Kris Green of Digital Spy described the skydive as one of the best stunts he had seen in a long time, commenting that Zoe's reaction to Sarah's death made him shed a tear, and that the episode on a whole was "amazing".<ref name="reaction">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a179313/loui-batleys-final-hollyoaks-interview.html|title=Loui Batley's final 'Hollyoaks' interview|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Green, Kris|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=2010-02-26}}</ref> The parachute stunt won 'Spectacular Scene Of The Year' at the 2010 British Soap Awards.<ref name="soapawrds"/>

[[Grace Dent]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented on the realism of Zoe's storyline involving Adrian stating: "hapless Zoe failed her exams after refusing to shag dismal tutor Adrian. Predatory lecturers taking advantage of gullible women? Actually, that's a plot line I can get my head around. The problem with being an academic perv these days is that one day sooner or later, the truth will out."<ref>{{cite web|last=Dent|first=Grace|title=Grace Dent's World of lather|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/jun/20/soap-operas-world-of-lather|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=([[Guardian Media Group|Guardian Media Group Plc]])|accessdate=2010-12-21|date=20 June 2009<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5v9C00wUz|archivedate=21 December 2010 -->}}</ref>
