After several years developing skills in still photography and production techniques, Small spent time at a small advertising firm in Melbourne owned by the Herbert Small Group, where she was taught to edit moving pictures by John Dixon.

Small was known for being a highly stylistic film maker, bringing an interesting visual expression to her films even though they were made as government-produced information films.<ref>NFSA Films, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66sP5bAe85Y&feature=youtu.be "Workout. Outlook Series."]</ref>
Indeed, an essay published by Senses of Cinema opined that "She was perhaps the best director in the otherwise aesthetically lacklustre interregnum in filmmaking at the Commonwealth Film Unit occurring between the Golden Era of the 1940<U+2032>s, which featured docudrama stylists Colin Dean and [[John Heyer]], and the reinvention and grooving up of the Unit under the production supervision of [[Gil Brealey]] and Richard Mason in the mid 1960<U+2032>s."<ref> Quentin Turnour, [http://sensesofcinema.com/2000/cteq/work/ Work Never Done: Australian Women Filmworkers from the 1930s to 1970s], ''Senses of Cinema'', July 2000</ref>
