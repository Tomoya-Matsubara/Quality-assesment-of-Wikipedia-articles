The first-generation '''iPad''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|a<U+026A>|p|<U+00E6>|d}} {{respell|EYE|pad}}) is a [[tablet computer]] designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] The device features an Apple A4 processor, a 9.7" touchscreen display and the capability of accessing Cellular networks, though the latter is only available on certain variants of the first generation iPad. Using the [[iOS]] operating system, the iPad can [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive email and [[web browser|browse the web]]. Other functions, which include the ability to play [[Video game|games]] and access [[reference work|references]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]] software and [[social network service]]s can be enabled by downloading [[application software|apps]].

The device was announced and unveiled on January 27, 2010 at a media conference. On April 3, 2010, the Wi-Fi variant of the device was released in the [[United States]], followed by the release of the Wi-Fi + Cellular variant on April 30. On May 28, it was released in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 

The device received primarily positive reviews from various technology blogs and publications. Reviewers praised the device for its wide range of capabilities and labelled it as a competitor to laptops and [[netbook]]s. Some aspects were criticized, including the closed nature of the operating system and the lack of support for the Adobe Flash multimedia format. During the first 80 days, three million iPads were sold. By the launch of the [[iPad 2]], Apple sold more than 15 million iPads. 

On March 2, 2011, Apple announced the new iPad 2 and the discontinuation of production of the original iPad.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2011/ | title=Apple Special Event - March 2, 2011 | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>

Apple reentered the mobile-computing market in 2007 with the [[iPhone]]. Smaller than the (not yet announced) iPad and featuring a camera and mobile phone, it pioneered the [[multitouch]] finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple's iOS mobile operating system.

By late 2009, the iPad's release had been rumored for several years.

Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2010/03/12/ipads-mute-switch-replaced-with-screen-rotation-lock/|title=iPad's 'Mute' Switch Replaced With Screen Rotation Lock. |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |publisher=[[MacRumors]]}}</ref> In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /> Unlike its successors, the first generation iPad has no cameras.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/11/ipadone/ | title=Why You Can Still Sell Your Original iPad for $250 | publisher=[[Wired]] | date=February 11, 2012 | accessdate=January 15, 2013 | author=McMillian, Robert}}</ref>

The iPad's [[touchscreen]] display is a 1,024 by 768 pixel, {{convert/2 |7.75|x|5.82|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[liquid crystal display]] (diagonal {{convert|9.7|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}), with [[Lipophobicity|fingerprint-]] and scratch-resistant glass. As a result of the device's screen dimensions and resolution, the screen has a pixel density of 132&nbsp;[[Pixel density|ppi]].<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /> The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis [[accelerometer]] to sense the iPad's orientation and switch between [[Page orientation|portrait and landscape]] modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support [[screen rotation]] in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic "native" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/3640/apples-ipad-the-anandtech-review/4|title=Apple's iPad - The AnandTech Review|first=Anand|last= Lal Shimpi, Brian Klug & Vivek Gowri|publisher=AnandTech|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2012|page=4|quote=The display rotates smoothly to orient itself properly regardless of how you<U+2019>re holding it.}}</ref>

The iPad was equipped with 16&nbsp;GB, 32&nbsp;GB, or 64&nbsp;GB of memory. Furthermore the device was available with two connectivity options, [[Wi-Fi]] only or Wi-Fi and Cellular.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /> Unlike its successors, the Wi-Fi + Cellular variant of the first generation iPad could only support carriers that utilized [[GSM]]/[[UMTS]] standards and was not compatible with [[CDMA]] networks, however like its successors, [[assisted GPS]] services are supported.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" />

The weight of the first generation iPad with different connectivity options varied. The Wi-Fi only variant weighed {{convert|1.5|lb|g|abbr=on}} whereas the variant with Wi-Fi + Cellular weighed {{convert|1.6|lb|g|abbr=on}}.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /> Its dimensions, however, are identical across the entire range of variants, measuring 9.56<U+00D7>7.47<U+00D7>0.50&nbsp;in (243<U+00D7>190<U+00D7>13&nbsp;mm).<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" />

===Accessories===
{{Main|iPad accessories}}
Apple offers several iPad accessories,<ref>{{cite web |title=iPad must-haves. And fun-to-haves |url=http://www.apple.com/ipad/accessories/ |publisher=Apple |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref> most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin [[dock connector]], the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /> A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/03/25/schiller-no-ipad-2-keyboard-dock-use-the-soft-keyboard/|title=Schiller: No iPad 2 keyboard dock, use the soft keyboard|publisher=9 to 5 Mac|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref> but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with [[Macintosh|Macs]] and [[personal computer|PCs]]. The iPad can be charged with a 10 W standalone power adapter, which is also compatible with iPods and iPhones.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4327 | title=iPhone, iPad, iPod: Using iPad Power Adapters | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate=January 31, 2013}}</ref>

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
Media reaction to the announcement of the device and the device itself was mixed. The media noted that thousands of people queued on the first day of sale in a number of countries with many of those who waited claiming that "it was worth it".<ref name="BBC-iPad-launch">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10182143|title=iPad fans mob Apple stores for international launch|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=May 31, 2010|work=BBC News  |publisher=BBC }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iRua5MeVoFRQ-PC_uTJ1OUYwNJpw|title=iPad-mania as thousands queue for global roll-out|work=[[Google News]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[Google]]|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

[[Walter Mossberg|Walt Mossberg]] (of ''The Wall Street Journal'') wrote, "It's about the software, stupid", meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad's success than software and user interface, his first impressions of which were largely positive. Mossberg also called the price "modest" for a device of its capabilities, and praised the ten-hour battery life.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://allthingsd.com/20100127/apple-ipad-impressions/ | title = First Impressions of the New Apple iPad | first=Walter S. |last=Mossberg | authorlink = Walter Mossberg | work=[[All Things Digital]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] | date = January 27, 2010 | accessdate =January 27, 2010 }}</ref> Others, including [[PC Advisor]] and the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating [[netbook]]s, most of which use [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/gadget/3211316/apple-ipad-versus-netbook-features-compared/|title=Apple iPad versus netbook: features compared |first=Eric |last=Lai |work=PC Advisor |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/ipad-vs-the-kindle-tablets-and-netbooks-20100202-n9jf.html|title=iPad vs the Kindle, tablets and netbooks |first=Simon |last=Tsang |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref> The base model's $499 price was lower than pre-release estimates by Wall Street analysts, and Apple's competitors, all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point.<ref name="FastCompany-price">{{cite web|title=The iPad's Biggest Innovation: Its $500 Price|url= http://www.fastcompany.com/article/apples-tablet-introduced?page=0%2C0|first=Kit |last=Eaton|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=March 7, 2010|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}</ref><ref name="WSJ Price">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094304575029621430370074.html|title=Apple's iPad Revolution: Price |first=Martin |last=Peers|date=January 28, 2010|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="AT price">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/01/tablet-makers-rethinking-things-in-wake-of-ipads-low-price/|title=Tablet makers rethinking things in wake of iPad's $499 price|first=Jon |last=Stokes|date=January 29, 2010|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publishing|Cond<U+00E9> Nast Digital]]|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref> CNET criticized the iPad for its apparent lack of wireless sync, which other portable devices such as Microsoft's [[Zune]] have had for a number of years. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10444796-27.html|title=How to make the iPad a better music device|first=Matt |last=Rosoff|work=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=January 30, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>
