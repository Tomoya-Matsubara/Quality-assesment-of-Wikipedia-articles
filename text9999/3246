'''Henry Rollins''' (born [[February 13]], [[1961]] as '''Henry Lawrence Garfield''') is an [[United States|American]] [[Grammy Award]]-winning hardcore/punk singer/songwriter; spoken word artist, book author (prose and poetry), radio and TV personality; occasional movie actor, comedian, and voice-over artist. He is most famous for his work with the hardcore punk band [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].

==Biography==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:HenryRollins.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Henry Rollins]] -->
<!-- Syntax correction -->Rollins was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] His parents divorced when he was young, and Rollins was raised primarily by his mother, Iris. He was prescribed [[Ritalin]] as a child and was sent to the [[The Bullis School]], a Washington, D.C. [[military school]]. He disliked the [[authoritarian]] atmosphere and the then-boys-only campus, which impeded his early attempts at dating and made him uncomfortable around women for several years. More positively, he said Bullis helped instill in him a sense of discipline and a strong work ethic. It was at military school that he began to develop his muscular build, which later led to what is known as the "most hardcore neck in music."

Rollins became involved in the [[punk music|punk]] scene through his close friend [[Ian MacKaye]] (who would later head [[Minor Threat]] and [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]]). [[Bad Brains]] was one of Rollins's favorite groups; singer [[H.R.]] would sometimes coax Rollins onstage to sing with them. Rollins then joined S.O.A. ([[State of Alert]]), which released one [[EP (format)|EP]] before disbanding. Rollins worked at a number of jobs (including at the [[National Institutes of Health]]), before becoming the manager of a [[H<U+00E4>agen-Dazs]] [[ice cream]] store; his steady employment and work ethic enabled him to finance the recording and pressing of the S.O.A. EP.

In [[1981]], his friend Mitch Parker gave him a copy of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]'s ''[[Nervous Breakdown]]'' EP. Rollins soon became a huge fan and began exchanging letters with the group. When Black Flag toured the East coast, playing Washington D.C. and [[New York City]], Rollins attended as many performances as he could. At an impromptu show in a bar, he asked to sing "Clocked In." As vocalist [[Dez Cadena]] was switching to [[guitar]], the band invited Rollins to a rehearsal. Impressed by his stage demeanor, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, due in part to MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality made him a perfect fit as their frontman. 

As Rollins become more heavily [[tattooed]] he wore less clothing on stage. Often as lead singer of  Black Flag and the Rollins Band he would hit the stage barechested and barefoot wearing only a pair of black shorts.

Rollins toured and recorded with Black Flag from 1981 until their breakup in 1986. During Rollins' tenure, Black Flag's music underwent dramatic changes. Though guitarist [[Greg Ginn]] was the primary songwriter, Rollins wrote a number of songs with Black Flag. 

Throughout most of his time with Black Flag, Rollins kept a diary of his thoughts and experiences. In 1994 he published these diaries as ''[[Get In The Van]]''; the book also featured many photographs, as well as Rollins' reminiscences of his time with the group before he kept a diary. Rollins read portions of ''Get In The Van'' for an [[audio book]]; this recording won a [[Grammy]].  Rollins later characterized the entire affair as "corny" and gave his Grammy statuette to an acquaintance.{{fact}}

Rollins began publishing his own books during his time with Black Flag. His early efforts were self-made volumes ([[photocopy|photocopied]] and stapled), though he quickly began printing [[chapbook]]s before moving on to establish [[2.13.61]], an independent publisher named after his birthday.

After Black Flag broke up in early 1986, Rollins quickly formed a new group and released a solo album and an EP with guitarist [[Chris Haskett]]. Soon, he added former [[Gone]] members [[Andrew Weiss]] and [[Sim Cain]], calling the new group the [[Rollins Band]]. They gained popularity through the strength of albums like ''The End of Silence'' (1992) and ''[[Weight (album)|Weight]]'' (1994). He also gained roles in movies and television shows (particularly as a [[VJ]] on [[MTV]]) and recorded a cover of [[AC/DC]]'s "[[Let There Be Rock]]" in 1991 with the [[Hard-Ons]].

Beginning in his later years in Black Flag, he has toured as a [[Spoken word|spoken-word]] artist, focusing mostly on social topics, as well as recounting his life experiences. His blend of self-deprecating humor and serious discussion of important social issues has gained him great popularity. He has released nine spoken-word albums through his [[2.13.61]] publishing company (and several through other record companies); 2.13.61 has also released books by Rollins, [[Joe Cole (roadie)|Joe Cole]], [[Nick Zedd]], [[Nick Cave]] and [[Michael Gira]], as well as albums by Rollins Band, [[Exene Cervenka]], [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], and [[Gun Club]].

Also while in Black Flag, Rollins met [[Joe Cole (roadie)|Joe Cole]], an acquaintance of Ginn. In December 1991, Rollins and Cole were robbed at the home they shared. Cole was murdered by a shot to the head, and while Rollins escaped without injury, the crime remains unsolved. Most of Rollins' subsequent efforts have been dedicated to his late friend's memory.

Rollins is an avowed [[free jazz]] fan, having released albums by [[Matthew Shipp]] and [[Roscoe Mitchell]] on his 2.13.61 label. In [[1990]], Rollins guest-hosted a [[Los Angeles, California]] college radio program and devoted much of this appearance to [[saxophone]] player [[Albert Ayler]]'s music.

Rollins has the distinction of having duetted with ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[William Shatner]] on the 2004 album ''[[Has Been]]''.

==Radio and television work==
On [[May 17]], [[2004]], Rollins began hosting a weekly radio show, ''Harmony In My Head'' (named after a favorite [[Buzzcocks]] song) on Los Angeles' [[Indie 103.1]] radio. The show aired every Monday evening, with Rollins playing a variety of rock, punk, rap and jazz music. He put the show on what would be an indefinite hiatus, with the last show airing on [[December 27]], [[2004]], in order to undergo a spoken-word tour in early [[2005]]. An expanded edition of Rollins' song lists and show notes of the first run of the show were published by 2.13.61 in November 2005 by fan demand as the book ''Fanatic''. In late 2005, Rollins announced the return to the airwaves of ''Harmony in My Head''; Internet users can listen online every Tuesday evening from 8 to 10 p.m., PST, at [http://www.indie1031.fm http://www.indie1031.fm], as of [[December 27]], [[2005]].  

Rollins is a co-host of the [[television]] program ''[[Full Metal Challenge]]'' on [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]], as well as the host of a weekly series called ''[[The Henry Rollins Show]]'' on the [[Independent Film Channel]] (IFC) airing every Saturday night at 10 p.m. The show is described this way on its official Web site [http://henryrollins.ifc.com/ http://henryrollins.ifc.com/]: 

"Henry Rollins unveils the independent alternative to late night programming with his unique take on music, film, politics and pop culture with the help from intelligent celebrity guests and the most eclectic musical performances on television."

Prior to his weekly series on [[IFC]], Rollins was a host of ''Henry's Film Corner'', a monthly look at movies and cinema.

In [[2004]], he became an outspoken human rights activist, most vocally a crusader for [[gay rights]]. He has pinpointed the rights for gays to marry as a "vital issue impeding on the rights of Americans today." He was the host of a [[benefit concert]] called "[http://www.wedrock.com/ WedRock]" to raise money for a pro-gay-marriage organization. During the [[2003 Iraq War]], he started touring with the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) to entertain troops overseas, despite his personal opposition to the war and the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]][http://www.uso.org/pubs/8_16_2143.cfm].  Rollins has also been very active in the campaign to free the "[[West Memphis 3|West Memphis Three]]" - three young men who many believe are wrongly accused of murder.  Rollins appears with [[Public Enemy]] frontman [[Chuck D]] on [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] song "Rise Above" on "Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three," a benefit album to help pay for the West Memphis Three defense fund. He also appears on a number of other songs.

==Trivia==
*Rollins appeared as himself in the [[video game]] ''[[Def Jam: Fight for NY]]'' as the main character's trainer. His Blazing Move in the game is called 2.13.61, which is also the name of his publishing company and his birthday.

*Rollins makes a cameo appearance in the music video for [[3rd Bass]] "Pop Goes the Weasel" as a "[[Vanilla Ice]]" parody character.

*He now has a show on an independent rock station based out of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]].

*In an interview with Howard Stern, Rollins answered the query regarding rumours he keeps the remains of his former roommate Joe Cole's "brains in a jar."  Reliving the chilling encounter and subsequent investigation leading to Cole's murder, Rollins explains that he could not bring himself to dispose of the bloodied-earth that was left behind by crime scene investigators.  He stated he retained the materials in a container rather than cruelly dispose of them.

*Rollins is mentioned in the song "You Need A Hug," which appears on the album ''End is Forever'' by [[The Ataris]].

*Rollins is mentioned in the song, "Feeling Bad" from the album, "How To Meet Girls" by [[Nerf Herder]]- "...Thought I'd look like Henry Rollins, But I still look like Phil Collins..." (in reference to working out at a gym)
