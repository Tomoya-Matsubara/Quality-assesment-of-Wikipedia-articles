'''Paul Cornell''' (August 5, 1822 <U+2013> March 3, 1904) was an American lawyer and [[Chicago]] [[real estate]] [[speculator]] who founded  the [[Hyde Park Township]] that included most of what are now known as the [[South Side (Chicago)|south]] and far southeast sides of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], United States.  He turned the south side [[Lake Michigan]] lakefront area, especially the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] and neighboring [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] and [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] neighborhoods, into a [[resort]] community that had its heyday from the 1850s through the early 20th century.  He was also an [[Urban planning|urban planner]] who paved the way for and [[Environmental preservation|preserved]] many of the [[park]]s that are now in the [[Chicago Park District]].  Additionally, he was a successful [[entrepreneur]] with interests in [[manufacturing]], [[cemeteries]], and [[hotel]]s.

His modern legacy includes several large parks now in the Chicago Park District:  [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], [[Washington Park, Chicago|Washington Park]], [[Midway Plaisance]] and [[Harold Washington Park]].  Most of the [[South side (Chicago)|South and Southeast Sides]] of Chicago were developed and eventually annexed into the City of Chicago as a result of his foresight.
==Background==
Born in [[Upstate New York]],<ref name=CP>Sawyers, June Skinner, ''Chicago Portraits'', "Paul Cornell", pp. 56-7, Loyola University Press, 1991, ISBN 0-8294-0701-4.</ref> Cornell was from a distinguished [[New England]] family, and was a cousin to [[Ezra Cornell]], founder of [[Cornell University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydeparkhistory.org/cornell.html | publisher=Hyde Park Historical Society|title=Paul Cornell - Founder of Hyde Park|accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref> When his father died (he was 9 at that time)<ref name=SC>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Cornell Avenue/Cornell Drive", pp. 26-7, Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6</ref> the family moved to the [[Adams County, IL]]/[[Schuyler County, IL]] area,<ref name=CP/> where he worked as a farmhand to pay for schooling.<ref name=SC/> He passed the Illinois [[bar examination]] and moved to Chicago in 1847.<ref name=CP/>  Unfortunately, his entire savings was stolen from his hotel room on his first night in town.<ref name=CP/>  A sympathetic [[lawyer]] provided him with both a loan and a job at the law office of Skinner and Hoyne, where he met [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Stephen Douglas]].

He was married to the [[sister-in-law]] of [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]], after whom [[Evanston, IL]] was named.  He had many strong local connections, being related to founders of [[Northwestern University]] (Evans and [[Orrington Lunt]]) and to George Kimbark of Riverside Improvement Company.<ref>Block, Jean F., ''Hyde Park Houses,'' University of Chicago Press, p. 3., 1978 ISBN 0-226-06000-4</ref>  His [[brother-in-law]] Kimbark purchased the area between 51st and 55th and Dorchester and Woodlawn to the west of Cornell's purchase.  Cornell later purchased this as well as other lands purchased by his Uncle, Hassan A. Hopkins, to add to Hyde Park.<ref name="HPH4"/>

[[File:Cornell Estate.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Paul Cornell's Estate at the current corner of 51st Street (East Hyde Park Boulevard) and Harper<ref name="HPH5"/>]]Douglas advised him to consider investing in  land south of the city limits.  After some [[horseback]] travels through the area, he began to envision a viable community there.  In 1853, following the advice of Douglas, he bought {{convert|300|acre|km2|2}} of property between 51st Street and 55th Street as a speculative investment.<ref name=CP/><ref name=OWC>{{cite web|url=http://www.graveyards.com/IL/Cook/oakwoods/cornell.html|accessdate=2007-04-11|title=Graveyards of Chicago Oak Woods Cemetery|publisher=Hucke, Matt|year=2002}}</ref>  This area was {{convert|7|mi|km|2}} south of the mouth of the [[Chicago River]] and {{convert|6|mi|km|2}} south of downtown Chicago.  In the 1850s, Chicago was still a walkable urban area well contained within a {{convert|2|mi|km|2}} radius of the center.<ref name="EOC192">Holian, Anna, (Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L.), "Commuting", 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago'', p. 192. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref>  It was common for development companies to locate hotels near [[Train station|rail depots]] to introduce visitors to new [[suburb]]s.<ref name=CL/> In 1856, Paul Cornell invented the Chicago railroad suburb.<ref name="EOC192"/> In an effort to improve his land value, he deeded {{convert|60|acre|km2|2}} to the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] in exchange for a [[Hyde Park/53rd Street (Metra)|53rd Street train station]] and a commitment of 6 daily connections to Chicago<U+2019>s Central Depot in each direction.<ref name=CP/><ref>Block, Jean F., ''Hyde Park Houses,'' University of Chicago Press, p. 1., 1978 ISBN 0-226-06000-4</ref><ref>Grinnell, Max, (Eds.

The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref>  He then marketed the neighborhood to wealthy Chicagoans as a [[resort]] area.  He selected the name Hyde Park to associate the area with the elite high class neighborhoods of [[Hyde Park, New York|New York]] and [[Hyde Park, London|London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/012special/hyde.html|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=Chicago Public Library|title=Hyde Park Community Collection}}</ref>

At about the same time, he built the [[Hyde Park House]] a 4 story [[hotel]] at 53rd Street and [[Lake Michigan]].<ref name="HPH4">Block, Jean F., ''Hyde Park Houses,'' University of Chicago Press, p. 4., 1978 ISBN 0-226-06000-4</ref>  The hotel became the focal point of the community and drew affluent guests with [[leisure time]] and [[discretionary income]].<ref name=CL>Keating, Ann Durkin, ''Chicagoland'', 2005, University of Chicago Press, pp. 103-4, ISBN 0-226-42882-6</ref>  This site is now occupied by the [[Hampton House]].  The hotel also helped others to envision a thriving affluent community in the area.  By 1861, the residents petitioned the Illinois General Assembly to create the Hyde Park Township.<ref name="CP" />

Paul Cornell specifically forbade [[heavy industry]] development in Hyde Park.<ref>Grinnell, Max, ''Hyde Park, Illinois'', p. 9, 2001, Arcadia Publishing, ISBN 0-7385-1893-X</ref>  This philosophy later became a part of the [[Burnham Plan]].  He maintained the character of Hyde Park, which was intended to be an elite suburb bordering Chicago, by selling only large lots that the affluent could afford.  The neighborhood flourished for the next two generations.

In 1889, the entire Hyde Park township (the area south of 39th Street, north of 138th Street, and east of State Street),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3716.html|accessdate=2007-04-14|work=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|title=Annexations and Additions to the City of Chicago|author= Keating, Ann Durkin}}</ref> which had quintupled in [[population]] from a 1880 population of 15,716 to a 1889 population of 85,000,<ref>Keating, Ann Durkin (Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L.), 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago'', "Hyde Park Township," p. 405. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref> voted for annexation to the City of Chicago.<ref name=CP/> Paul Cornell planned and advocated a town with a lakefront park, a [[Midway Plaisance|plaisance]], an adjoining park and boulevards shaped the town.  His plan for a cornerstone institution to rival [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]'s [[Northwestern University]] was at first thwarted by the decision to establish a [[theological seminary]] on the north side,<ref name="HPH4"/> but would come to fruition with the foundation of the [[University of Chicago]] through the philanthropy of [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Marshall Field]] in 1890.  

Hyde Park maintained racially-[[restrictive covenants]] excluding [[African-American]]s from purchasing, leasing, or occupying homes in Hyde Park for nearly one hundred years until this segregative tool was struck down by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in a 1940 case, ''[[Hansberry v. Lee|Lee v. Hansberry]]'',<ref>''Lee v. Hansberry'', 311 U.S. 32 (1940).</ref> concerning the nearby [[Washington Park Subdivision]].  At his death, Cornell bequeathed East End Park (Now renamed [[Harold Washington Park]]) to the city.  The stone pictured above commemorates this gift.

==Civic Leadership==
Cornell is considered the "father of the South Parks System" for his extensive efforts after the [[American Civil War]] to create a parks system south of Chicago.  Cornell, as a real estate developer, presented a convincing case to city developers that a parks system would increase the value of land surrounding it.<ref name=CIM>Holland, Robert A., ''Chicago in Maps: 1612 to 2002'', Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., p. 134., ISBN 0-8478-2743-7</ref>  Cornell based his arguments on [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], which had substantially raised surrounding real estate values.<ref name=CIM/>  Repeated attempts eventually got a plan through the Illinois General Assembly.<ref name=SC/><ref>Chicago: City of Neighborhoods</ref>  As a civic leader he along with his peer [[William Le Baron Jenney]], the West Parks commissioner, commissioned urban [[landscape]] [[designer]]s such as [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], [[Calvert Vaux]], [[Ossian Simonds]], [[H. W. S. Cleveland]], and [[Jens Jensen]] to create landscaped cemeteries, to implement a coordinated parks and boulevard system and to design the railroad-served suburbs to complement urban civilization.<ref>Harrington, Kevin, (Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L.), "Landscaping", 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago'', p. 461. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref>

In 1869, the state passed the "Parks Law", which created the north, south and west parks district.<ref name=CIM/>    The parks districts were established as municipal corporations with funding based on the taxable real estate within its service area.<ref name=CIM/>  The legislation provided for orderly growth and evolution of the city by outlining not only the powers and duties of the parks districts, but also the geography of the parks and connecting boulevards.<ref name=CIM/>  Cornell was able to both benefit financially from the [[United States Dollar|$]]46 million spent on the parks during the remainder of the century and to assume a position of influence over the parks.<ref name=CIM/>   Cornell served for over 13 years on the South Parks Commission,<ref name=CP/> which regulated parks south of the city.  This position enabled him to pursue his vision which was to have a park system that would give "lungs to the great city and its future generations."<ref name=SC/>  He also served as the Hyde Park Township's first Town Supervisor.<ref name=CP/>  Today, [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], [[Washington Park, Chicago|Washington Park]] and [[Harold Washington Park]] stand as a testament to his efforts.  These parks became major selling points that contributed to the growth of Hyde Park.<ref name=CP/>

==Other ventures==
[[File:Hyde Park Hotel 1910.JPG|thumb|left|125px|Hyde Park Hotel in 1910]][[File:Hyde Park Hotel 1927.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Hyde Park Hotel in 1927]]
In 1887, Cornell built the Hyde Park Hotel (left, 1887<U+2013>1963) on the former site of his home at Lake Park and East Hyde Park Boulevard.<ref name="EAC99">Host, William R. and Brooke Ahne Portmann, "Early Chicago Hotels," Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 99., ISBN 0-7385-4041-2.</ref>  The hotel was expanded in 1891.<ref name="EAC99" />  In 1914, the hotel expanded (for a second time), which doubled its capacity to 300 rooms (see right).<ref name="EAC99" />

Paul Cornell also purchased the [[swampland]] and [[prairie]] {{convert|8|mi|km|1}} south of the Loop at the intersection of the [[Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway]] and the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] at a location that now is 75th Street and South Chicago Avenue in 1855.  He subdivided parcels for sale through the 1870s.  The area, which was first named Cornell, became [[Greater Grand Crossing, Chicago|Grand Crossing]].<ref>Best, Wallace, (Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L.), "Greater Grand Crossing", 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago'', p. 364. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref> He had accumulated a total of {{convert|960|acre|sqmi km2|1|lk=on}} land at one point.<ref name=CHRSAioAahss>{{cite book|title=Chicago Historic Resources Survey: An inventory of Architecturally and historically significant structures|chapter=Community Area #69: Greater Grand Crossing|pages=444<U+2013>447|year=1996|author=Commission on Chicago Landmarks and the Chicago Department of Planning and Development}}</ref>  The reason that the name was changed was the pre-existence of [[Cornell, Illinois]].<ref name=CHRSAioAahss/>

Paul Cornell established the Cornell Watch Factory at 76th Street and the Illinois Central tracks in 1876 in Grand Crossing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/232.html|title=Chatham|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|year=2005|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|author=Best, Wallace}}</ref> Among his other ventures, Cornell founded Republic Life Insurance Company and the American Bronze Company.<ref name=SC/> He served as secretary for a group of Chicagoans who purchased {{convert|167|acre|km2|2}} in 1853 to create [[Oak Woods Cemetery]].<ref name="HPH4"/>  He has a {{convert|15|ft|m}} tall [[zinc]] monument at the cemetery.<ref name=OWC/>
