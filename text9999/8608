'''''The Heart of a Goof''''' is a collection of nine [[short stories]] by English comic writer [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. It was first published in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on [[April 15]] [[1926]] by [[Herbert Jenkins]], and in the [[United States|U.S.]] on [[March 4]] [[1927]] by [[George H. Doran]], [[New York]], under the title ''Divots''. 

The stories all concern [[golf]], and are told by the [[Oldest Member]]; the book can be considered a sequel to his first similar collection, ''[[The Clicking of Cuthbert]]'' (1922). The dedication is typically Wodehousian, reading "To my daughter Leonora without whose never-failing sympathy and encouragement this book would have been finished in half the time".
