'''<U+015E>tefan Constantinescu''', born 1968, is a visual artist and film director living and working in Stockholm and Bucharest. He works with various mediums including film, artist books and paintings approaching the political through introspection to challenge notions of identity, while working in and with issues of post-communist Romania.<ref>Simons Nastac, <U+201C>Art in Romania Today: Pocket Revolutions<U+201D>, Hart International, March 2003</ref> Constantinescu grew up in Romania during the most austere years of communism, where an ordinary day began with a queue for almost anything (bread, shampoo, gas) - days of routine. As a result his work is often strongly autobiographical.<ref>Simona Nastac, <U+201C><U+0218>tefan Constantinescu<U+201D>, Flash Art No. 256, 2007</ref> Within the work, monuments are challenged as permanent inscriptions of memory, fictional films resemble un-official documentaries, and artist books challenge history and education. Known for his "powerful study of everyday terror" in his short film ''Troleibuzul 92'' that was shown in the [[Venice Biennale]] 2009 <ref>Patricia Bickers, Art Monthly, July<U+2013>August 2009</ref><ref>Lynn Macritchie, <U+201C>Melancholy Giardini: The National Pavilions<U+201D>, Art in America, September 2009</ref><ref>Barbara A.

Recent work includes the painting series ''An Infinite Blue'', the pop up book ''The Golden Age for Children'', the film ''My Beautiful Dacia'' (co-directed with Julio Sotto) and the film ''Passagen''.

=== The Last Analog Revolution, a Memory Box ===
In his 2011 project with Xandra Popescu Constantinescu is bringing together artists from Eastern and Western Europe. It reflects on the evolving concepts of revolution and geo-political division. The exhibition incorporates a cardboard installation with a series of video works by Hungarian artist [[P<U+00E9>ter Forg<U+00E1>cs]], Poland<U+2019>s [[Zuzanna Janin]], UK-based collaborators Karen Mirza and Brad Butler, Lithuanian Deimantas Narkevi<U+010D>ius and Switzerland<U+2019>s[[Yves Netzhammer]], sound-work by Liliana Moro, a sculpture by Via Lewandowski and Constantinescu's own film ''My Beautiful Dacia''. The project will be exhibited at the 54th Venice Biennale in autumn, 2011.<ref>[http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/exhibition/artists/ The 54th Venice Biennale website], Retrieved May, 2011</ref> ''The Last Analog Revolution, a Memory Box'' functions within the framework of the project ''Romanian Cultural Resolution <U+2013> documentary'' <ref>Club Electro Putere at the Venice Biennale: ''Romanian Cultural Resolution-documentary'' on [http://www.e-flux.com/shows/view/9352 E-Flux]</ref> and will be exhibited at the New Gallery of the Romanian Institute for Culture and Humanistic Research in Venice.<ref>[http://www.icr.ro/venetia/ Romanian Institute for Culture and Humanistic Research in Venice.]</ref>The Artist initially had intended "to base the project around a kind of interactive memory box, for which a selection of international artists were due to be invited to design an object referring to their Cold War experience of a divided Europe. This idea, however, proved financially and logistically difficult to achieve. Instead, Constantinescu and co-curator Xandra Popescu have selected existing works of art to exhibit in a group installation."<ref>Richard Unwin, <U+201C>Romanian project to premiere at Venice<U+201D>, The Art Newspaper, June 2011, London, UK</ref>

=== An Infinite Blue ===

He never raises his voice, but his reproaches quickly grow fierce to the point of obscenity... In the Eastern European setting of Constantinescu's piece, in the aftermath of generations under communist rule, uncertainty over the duties of citizenship must weigh heavily on individuals' minds."<ref>Kenneth Baker, Chronicle Art Critic, <U+201C>Audience as Subject: Part I: Medium<U+201D>, SFGate (9 december), San Fracisco, USA</ref> The surrounding passengers are visibly uncomfortable by these exclamations, yet nobody intervenes to stifle his threats - and in such "Constantinescu may be implying that they are accomplices."<ref>Chris Bors, <U+201C>Audience as Subject, Part 1: Medium<U+201D>, Artforum International Magazine (January), New York, USA</ref>

The book creates a story which covers 20 years of Romanian contemporary history, beginning in 1968 (the year Stefan Constantinescu was born) and ends with the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution]] in 1989. For the reader of this children<U+2019>s book an uncanny quality emerges in the tension between the na<U+00EF>vety of the form and the dark surrealism of its content.<ref>Maxa Zoller in Romanian Cultural Resolution, A digest of contemporary Romanian Art. Retrieved May, 2011</ref> Constantinescu created the work "in order to recount his experience <U+2013> living under the regime of Ceausescu <U+2013> to his daughter. In the process he encounters the challenge of telling the story and of passing on history to younger generations as he weaves text and photos from his own life with briefly stated historical facts in textbook form."<ref>Daniel Tucker, <U+201C>Truth is Stranger On the Bucharest Biennale 4: Handlung. On Producing Possibilities<U+201D>, Art-Agenda, June 2010</ref>
