Arranged by [[Bebu Silvetti]], it was one of the two original compositions written for Miguel's fifteenth studio album ''[[Romances]]''. It was released as the lead single from the album on July 15, 1997 and it became his thirteenth number-one single on the [[Hot Latin Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Songs]] chart in the United States. The music video features Miguel performing at a fine-dining restaurant in [[New York City]].

The track received a negative reaction from [[Achy Obejas]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' who called it "lame". It was nominated [[Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Song of the Year|Pop Song of the Year]] at the [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1998|10th Annual Lo Nuestro Awards]] and Manzanero was awarded a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] (BMI) Latin Award for writing the song.
