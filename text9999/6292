The '''Brown Shrike''' (''Lanius cristatus'') is a [[bird]] in the [[shrike]] family that is found mainly in Asia. It is closely related to the [[Red-backed Shrike]] (''L. collurio'') and [[Isabelline Shrike]] (''L. isabellinus''). Like most other shrikes, it has a distinctive black "bandit-mask" through the eye. and is found mainly in open scrub habitats, where it perches on the tops of thorny bushes in search of prey. Several populations of this widespread species form distinctive subspecies which breed in temperate [[Asia]] and migrate to their winter quarters in tropical Asia. They are sometimes found as vagrants in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].

==Description==
[[File:Brown Shrike (Lanius cristatus)- Immature in Kolkata I IMG 6072.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Immature ([[Kolkata]], [[India]])]]
This shrike is mainly brown on the upper parts and the tail is rounded. The black mask can be paler in winter and has a white brow over it. The underside is creamy with rufous flanks and belly. The wings are brown and lack any white "mirror" patches. Females tend to have fine scalloping on the underside and the mask is dark brown and not as well marked as in the male. The distinction is not easy to use in the field but has been tested with breeding birds in Japan where the female can be identified from the presence of a brood patch.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A sexual difference in plumage of Brown Shrike subspecies, Lanius cristatus superciliosus|author=Takagi, M|year=1996| journal=J.

A number of confusing forms are known from central Asia where the populations of ''cristatus'', ''isabellinus'' and ''collurio'' overlap. The taxonomy has been in a state of flux and some forms such as ''phoenicuroides'' formerly considered as subspecies of ''L. cristatus'' have been moved to the species ''L. isabellinus''.<ref name=pcr/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Mauersberger, G & L A Portenko |year=1971|chapter=Lanius collurio L., Lanius isabellinus Hemprich u.

==Distribution==
The nominate form breeds in northern Asia from Mongolia to Siberia and winters in South Asia, Myanmar and the Malay Peninsula. The race ''confusus'' described from the same region is not well marked but is said to have a wider white brow and paler upperparts and is sometimes included within the nominate population. Subspecies ''superciliosus'' (sometimes called the Japanese Shrike) breeds on the islands of Sakhalin, Kuril and Japan and winters in Hainan, Sumatra, Java, and the Sundas. Subspecies ''lucionensis'', sometimes known as the Philippine Shrike, breeds in Korea and eastern China wintering mainly in Taiwan, Philippines but also on the Andaman Islands and in peninsular India.<ref name=pcr/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Occurrence of ''Lanius cristatus lucionensis'' in the Western Ghats, Kerala|author=Balachandran S & Rajan Sehgal|journal=J.

The Brown Shrike is a [[bird migration|migratory]] species and ringing studies show that they have a high fidelity to their wintering sites, often returning to the same locations each winter.<ref name=medway>{{cite journal|title=A ringing study of the migratory brown shrike in West Malaysia| author=Lord Medway|journal=Ibis |volume=112|issue=2|pages=184<U+2013>198| year=1970|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1970.tb00092.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Non-breeding site fidelity in Northern Shrikes|author=Rimmer, CC & CH Darmstadt |year=1996|journal= J.
