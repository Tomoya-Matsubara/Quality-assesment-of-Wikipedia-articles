Trimax designs, develops, builds and markets high quality [[Roller mower| roller mowers]] with flail or rotary blade systems. The company's headquarters are located in [[Tauranga]], [[New Zealand]].
==History==
The Company was founded by the former [[General Motors | GM]] Production Engineer Bob Sievwright. After he graduated [[Kettering University | General Motors Institute]] in [[Flint, Michigan]] he designed, manufactured and sold special flails for flail mowers. But after he lost his only customer he started his own mowing company.
The first mowers were flail mowers and flail mulchers for kiwifruit cultivation, Trimax was soon recognised for their high quality of cut and strong build [[Roller mower]].<ref>http://www.trimaxmowers.com/index.php/9-articles/224-history.html</ref><ref>NZ Business;Feb95, Vol. 9 Issue 1, p24</ref>

In 1981 the company, then named Trimax Industries Ltd., began with the production of their first flail mowers Ezeemow, Mowcraft and Mulchmasta. 
Only a few years later, in 1985, the company started its own dedicated research and developement department and exported their first products to Australia.

The Company was awarded  for "Best Engineering" in 1991 and "Exporter of the Year" in 1993 by the BNZ Bay of Plenty Export Awards.<ref>NZ Business;Sep2008, Vol. 22 Issue 8, p4</ref>

To support Trimax' early exports to the USA, Bob Sievwright started the company "Base3USA" in the early 90's. The company is based in [[Griffin, Georgia]] near [[Atlanta, Georgia | Atlanta]] and provides warehouses, logistics and fulfilment for other importers.<ref>http://exportermagazine.co.nz/articles/sourcing-logistics-solutions</ref> <ref>http://www.base3usa.com/home.php?id=265</ref>

In 1997 [[Windsor Castle]] and the surrounding [[Windsor Great Park]] started using Trimax ProCut mowers for their maintenance.<ref> NZ Management, Issue March 2002; http://www.management.co.nz/articles/kindest-cut</ref>

In 1998 the company opened their first UK office and warehouse in Little Addington, Northamptonshire to supply local dealers and in 2005 they opened their very own distribution warehouse in Griffin, Georgia, USA. 

In 2008 the Pegasus S3 mower was awarded bronze at the 2008 New Zealand Best Design Awards. And 2 years later the Trimax Merlin mower, the predecessor of Snake, was awarded silver at the 2010 New Zealand Best Design Awards.<ref>http://bestawards.co.nz/entries/product/category/non-consumer/merlin/</ref>

The company won the Bay of Plenty Export Awards for the second time in 2010 and is regarded as the most prominent company of the region.<ref>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&objectid=10997687</ref>

In 2011 Trimax Mowing Systems was awarded Elite dealer of the year at the UK Awards.<ref>http://www.pitchcare.com/magazine/trimax-elite-dealer-of-the-year-uk-awards.html</ref>

===Rotary Mowers===
* '''Striker''', a basic rotary mower for compact tractors. 150cm and 190cm wide models.

Trimax rotary mowers are fitted with a special blade system with an offset mounting hole that alters the center of gravity of the blade causing it to tilt-forward whilst cutting. This will help to avoid strips of uncut gras when going through heavy grounds. The Blades, marketed as "Trimax LazerBladez", are made from a special alloy steel which provides greater durability needed in commercial mowing operations.

===Flail Mowers===
* '''Ezeemow S2''', a flail mower for compact tractors.

* '''FlailDek FX''', a front-mounting flail mower. A special front-mounting tractor is required.

* '''Warlord S2''', a heavy duty flail mower and mulcher for tractors up to 100hp. The Warlord S2 can shred branches up to 75mm in diameter.

Trimax flail mowers are fitted with special flails designed by the company's founder, Bob Sievwright. The aerodynamic design of the flails reduces the horse power requirements for the tractor.
