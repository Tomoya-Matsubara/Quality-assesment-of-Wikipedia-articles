'''Radio Victory''' was the [[independent local radio]] (ILR) station for [[Portsmouth]] in southern [[England]]. It was launched on 14 October 1975 and served south [[Hampshire]], [[West Sussex]] and the [[Isle of Wight]].

==History==
Victory was one of the first 19 independent stations in the UK, all of which started broadcasting between 1973 and 1976.
Its studios were based in [[Fratton]], Portsmouth. Its [[FM broadcasting|FM]] transmitter, on 95.0&nbsp;MHz, was at [[Fort Widley]] with only 0.2&nbsp;kW but the signal reached [[Southampton]] and all over the Isle of Wight quite well. It also broadcast on [[Medium Wave]] 257m (1169&nbsp;kHz, later moving to 1170&nbsp;kHz) from [[Farlington, Hampshire|Farlington Marshes]] with 0.2&nbsp;kW.

Victory had three managing directors throughout its life - Guy Paine, John Russell, and finally Bruce Jenkins. Housed in St Mary's Institute in Portsmouth's Fratton Road, Its address was PO Box 257, Portsmouth PO1 5RT.
For most of its life it transmitted from 6&nbsp;am to 1&nbsp;am Mondays<U+2013>Fridays, 6&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am Saturdays and 7&nbsp;am to midnight on Sundays. This increased to 24-hour broadcasting from the start of the Falklands Conflict. Newsreader Penny Guy broadcast news of the first UK warship casualty<U+2014>the sinking of [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']]. Listeners were unaware her fianc<U+00E9> Derek was aboard the vessel, and she had no idea if he were alive or dead. (He survived - they wed shortly afterwards). {{ref|WRT}}

The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] didn't renew its licence in 1985 so the station ceased broadcasting on 28 June 1986 at 12&nbsp;pm after 10 years and around 257 days on air despite a local campaign to save it. Fratton Road was jammed solid with traffic blaring their horns in tribute as the airwaves fell silent for the last time. Victory was the first ILR station to lose its franchise (although two others, [[Centre Radio]] and [[Gwent Broadcasting]], went off air after going bankrupt).

The station was replaced by [[Ocean Sound]] which was given a licence for a larger coverage area including [[Southampton]].

The name of Victory, as a radio station for the Portsmouth area, was re-invented in 1994 to mark the city's 800th birthday and the 50th anniversary of [[D-Day]] (the city was the world's focus for this, hosting many events including a dinner for world leaders in the [[Portsmouth Guildhall|Guildhall]]). [[Victory FM]] was set up by Mark Samways with the help of Kevin Huffer. Alex Bentley, the city's Lord Mayor during the set-up period, was most encouraging and helped by arranging for the council to provide space for the studios in the civic offices for a [[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]] rent. This first outing for the new service acquired a 28-day broadcast licence, called an Restricted Service Licence RSL), from the [[Radio Authority]].

It returned to the air twice more as Victory FM<U+2014>over the Christmas period of 1994 and again in 1995 to mark [[VE Day]]'s 50th anniversary. The studios for this period were located in the Anchor House, [[North End, Portsmouth|North End]] and were loaned by the owners the [[Bradford and Bingley Building Society]]. The building had been empty since the [[Hampshire Building Society]] closed for business.

The name Radio Victory was kept alive by predominantly the same team,  broadcasting from a studios in Twyford Avenue, [[Stamshaw]]; this time broadcasting on [[cable TV]] and with occasional temporary FM licences for special occasions such as their own launch on cable at Christmas 1995 and to cover the [[Special Olympics]]. A total of six 28-day RSL FM broadcasts were made from 1994 to 1998.

When [[Greater Portsmouth]] was re-issued with its own ILR franchise, Radio Victory won the bid. It returned to the airwaves on 19 September 1999 on 107.4 FM.
The station was acquired by [[The Local Radio Company|TLRC]] at the end of 1999, so the 2000 saw a massive change of personnel. It would seem that, without the key members who took the station from 28-day RSL to full time FM licence, it was unable to compete in the [[RAJAR]] ratings against now established local rivals like [[Ocean FM (UK)|Ocean FM]] and [[Wave 105]]. The station later relaunched as Victory 107.4 and [[107.4 The Quay]], allying itself closely to [[Portsmouth Football Club]] (PFC) who from Autumn of 2009 became the sole owners. During 2010 PFC sold the station to Celador's radio arm and the frequency became part of a regional station called Breeze. The local studios in Twyford Avenue used since 1999 were closed.

==On Air==
One of Victory's longest running shows was the ''Victory Roll'', its own top 40 chart show aired on Saturday evenings until all ILR stations started simulcasting the [[The Network Chart Show|Network Chart]] from [[Capital Radio]].

In 2012 it was announced that a new online station called Victory Gold would be launched by popular radio presenter Gary Jackson. The station itself has no connection to the previous Radio Victory but will be playing music from the era that the original Victory was on air. New programmes include Dark Side Of The Moon and My Generation.
