{{Campaignbox Kurdish separatism in Iran}}
'''Hama Rashid revolt''' refers to a tribal uprising in [[Pahlavi]] Iran, during the [[Second World War]], following the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].<ref name=Jwaideh/> The tribal revolt erupted in the general atmosphere of anarchy throughout Iran and its main faction was led by Muhammed Rashid, lasting from late 1941 until April 1942 and then re-erupted in 1944, resulting in Rashid's defeat.

==Background==
{{further|Kurdish separatism in Iran}}
Kurdish tribal unrest began in modern Iran, right with the ascendance of the Pahlavi dynasty, erupting into bloody violence with the [[Simko Shikak revolt|Shikak revolt]] in 1920, and continuing with further Kurdish tribal revolts in 1926 and 1931.

With the general instability in Iran during the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]], the British were approached by the tribal leader of Baneh Hama Rashid and by a Mahabad leader Qazi Muhammad, in order to obtain protection.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> The delegation of chieftains arrived in Baghdad, requesting to include their areas in the "British zone", but were refused.<ref name=Jwaideh/>

At the time, Tehran was desperate to prevent Kurdish secession, sending a government commission into Kurdistan in November 1941. It convened local Kurdish tribal leaders, promising cultural freedom with in line with the right of bearing arms, in return for loyalty to Iranian administration.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> The tribes had however enjoyed those privileges from the time of the deposition of Reza Shah two months earlier, thus rejecting the Iranian offer.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> To satisfy themselves, the tribal leaders also demanded assurances to return confiscated lands and employment of tribal leaders and their representatives in Tehran.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> Indeed, some eight months later, a Tribal Commission was established in Tehran to investigate Kurdish land complaints. In the meantime however, the tribes aspired to make a new order of thongs, before a significant Allies intervention changes the situation and fills the power vacuum.

Just prior to the entrance of Soviet troops into Urmiyeh, a local bazaar was set in fire, also picking up large stockpiles of weapons, left behind by fleeing Iranian soldiery.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> Further south, the areas of Sanandaj and Kermanshah fell into disorder and by the end of the year raids by armed Kurdish tribesmen reached as far as Tabriz.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> In January 1942, relations between Azeris, Kurds and Christians in Urmiyeh turned strained, with Kurds and Christian Armenians and Assyrians forming a joint ''Liberation'' party. The joint forces raided Azeri villages. In April 1942, renewed tribal disorder in the area, prompted Iranian government to arm Shia peasants, but on the other hand removed gendarmerie forces from lands between Khoi and Mahabad to satisfy demands.

==First conflict phase==
Meanwhile, through the final months of 1941 in central Kurdistan, Hama Rashid seized Baneh and had set up his own administration.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> With an aid of a number of followers, he executed his authority in the Baneh-Sardasht region.<ref name=Jwaideh/> At the time, despite his responsibility for a death of a senior Iranian officer, and being regarded as a rebel, Iran was too weak to subdue him.<ref name=Jwaideh/> By December he was already threatening to seize Sanandaj and was only convinced to refrain from action by a British threat. In February 1942, Rashid's forces seized Saqqiz, but were driven out of there in April.<ref name=mcdawall2004/>

In early autumn of 1942, Hama Rashid agreed to become a semi-official governor under Tehran authority as a local office, but according to a British report ''Neither side would hesitate to abandon this relationship, if it could find something more attractive''.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> About the same time, Iranian government also recognized another Kurdish leader - Mahmud Kanisanan as a semi-autonomous governor of Meriwan region.<ref name=Jwaideh/>

==Second conflict phase==
According to McDawall, in 1944, the relationship between Hama Rashid and Iranian authorities was broken.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> Jwaideh puts the beginning of the second phase to summer of 1942.<ref name=Jwaideh/>  In any case, Rashid attacked Mariwan territories of his neighbour Mahmud Khan Kanisanan - an appointed Iranian governor as well.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> Mahmud Khan requested an assistance from Tehran and received two Iranian columns, supported by light tanks, who had defeated Hama Rashid's forces.<ref name=Jwaideh/> Iranian forces who rushed to rescue Mahmud Khan, managed to drive Hama Rashid into Iraqi Kingdom.<ref name=Jwaideh/><ref name=mcdawall2004/> During the retreat Rashid had however succeeded to burn some 1,000 houses in Baneh.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> Shortly after, also Mahmud Khan himself was driven out into Iraq as well by the same Iranian forces, seeking to get rid of Kurdish semi-autonomous authority in the region.

==Aftermath==
{{further|Iranian crisis of 1946}}
As a result of the above described actions, by 1945 the government of Iran effectively controlled Kurdish areas south of Saqqiz-Baneh-Sardasht line.<ref name=Jwaideh/> However, the government was still not able to establish authority north to it up to the Soviet zone. It was Mahabad, located in those areas, where the most important Kurdish political developments went to take place.<ref name=Jwaideh/> Shortly thereafter, the [[Iran crisis of 1946]] took shape, seeking to establish Azeri and Kurdish states with Soviet support. Hama Rashid and his forces took an important role in this next chapter of [[Kurdish-Iranian conflict|violence]].<ref>Vali, A. ''Kurds and the State in Iran: The Making of Kurdish Identity'': p.80.

==Foreign reactions==
* United Kingdom - the general position of the Kingdom was opposing any kind of autonomy or independence for Iranian Kurds, which in their opinion would prompt a similar demand from the Arabs of Khuzestan and perhaps other ethnic groups,<ref name=mcdawall2004>McDawall, D. ''A Modern History of the Kurds: Third Edition'':p.232-4. 2004.</ref> especially Iraqi tribes and most notably the Kurds of Iraqi Kingdom.<ref name=mcdawall2004/> Britain hence acted to ease ethnic and tribal tensions within Iran and told Tehran to settle Kurdish demands, reinstate tribal leaders and permit tribal migration as long as it doesn't breach peace.<ref name=mcdawall2004/>
*Soviet Union - it was initially assumed that Russians might assist Kurdish independence movement, but their behaviour quickly turned those hopes in vein.<ref name=Jwaideh>Jwaideh, W. ''The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development.'':p.245.</ref>
