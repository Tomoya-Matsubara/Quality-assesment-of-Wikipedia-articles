==Criticism==

The teachers of Crestwood High School have been accused, by students,<ref name=Crestwoot>{{cite web|title=Schools NSW|url=http://schoolsnsw.webs.com/|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref> of imposing socialist and/or unionist beliefs upon students, with the accounts of students recalling members of staff despising those of a conservative political background. It would appear that the higher administrative staff attempt to ensure that political correctness is upheld, with entire days planned to celebrate [[multiculturalism]] and respect. While it is true that Crestwood High is a multicultural school, with some 42% of attendees coming from a language background other than English<ref name=multic>{{cite web|title=Crestwood High School, Enrolments|url=http://crestwoodhs.com/site/2/prospective-students|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref>, some reports<ref name=reports>{{cite web|title=Crestwood High School Reviews|url=http://au.ratemyteachers.com/crestwood-high-school/914-s|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref> claim that those of [[South Asia|South Asian]] descent feel disadvantaged within the school, with racial tensions remaining at an unsustainable level.
