'''Titanium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Ti''' and [[atomic number]] 22. It is a lustrous [[transition metal]] with a silver color, low density and high strength. It is highly resistant to [[corrosion]] in [[sea water]], [[aqua regia]] and [[chlorine]].

Titanium was discovered in [[Cornwall]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], by [[William Gregor]] in 1791 and named by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] for the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]]. The element occurs within a number of [[mineral]] deposits, principally [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]], which are widely distributed in the [[Earth's crust]] and [[lithosphere]], and it is found in almost all living things, rocks, water bodies, and soils.<ref name="EBC"/> The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores via the [[Kroll process]]<ref name="LANL"/> or the [[Hunter process]]. Its most common compound, [[titanium dioxide]], is a popular [[Photocatalysis|photocatalyst]] and is used in the manufacture of white pigments.<ref name="HistoryAndUse">{{cite book|last=Krebs|first=Robert E.|title=The History and Use of Our Earth's Chemical Elements: A Reference Guide (2nd edition)|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=[[Westport, CT]]|isbn=0-313-33438-2|year=2006}}</ref> Other compounds include [[titanium tetrachloride]] (TiCl<sub>4</sub>), a component of [[smoke screen]]s and [[catalyst]]s; and [[titanium trichloride]] (TiCl<sub>3</sub>), which is used as a catalyst in the production of [[polypropylene]].<ref name="EBC"/>

Titanium can be [[alloy]]ed with [[iron]], [[aluminium]], [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], among other elements, to produce strong lightweight alloys for aerospace ([[jet engine]]s, [[missile]]s, and [[spacecraft]]), military, industrial process (chemicals and petro-chemicals, [[desalination plant]]s, pulp, and paper), automotive, agri-food, medical [[prostheses]], orthopedic [[Implant (medicine)|implants]], dental and endodontic instruments and files, [[dental implant]]s, sporting goods, jewelry, [[mobile phone]]s, and other applications.<ref name="EBC"/>

The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal.<ref>{{cite book|title=TITANIUM: A Technical Guide|year=1988|author=Donachie, Matthew J., Jr.|publisher=ASM International|location=Metals Park, OH|page=11|isbn=0-87170-309-2}}</ref> In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some [[steel]]s, but 45% lighter.<ref name="Barksdale1968p738">{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=738}}</ref> There are two [[allotropy|allotropic]] forms<ref name="TICE6th">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Titanium|encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]|edition=6th|year=2000<U+2013>2006|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|url=http://www.answers.com/Titanium|location=New York|isbn=0-7876-5015-3}}</ref> and five naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of this element, <sup>46</sup>Ti through <sup>50</sup>Ti, with <sup>48</sup>Ti being the most [[natural abundance|abundant]] (73.8%).<ref name="EnvChem">{{cite web|url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/Ti-pg2.html#Nuclides|title=Periodic Table of Elements: Ti <U+2013> Titanium|accessdate=2006-12-26|author=Barbalace, Kenneth L.|year=2006}}</ref> Titanium's properties are chemically and physically similar to [[zirconium]], as both of them have the same number of [[valence electrons]] and are in the same [[Periodic table group|group]] in the [[periodic table]].

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
A [[metal]]lic [[chemical element|element]], titanium is recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio.<ref name="TICE6th"/> It is a strong metal with low [[density]] that is quite [[ductility|ductile]] (especially in an [[oxygen]]-free environment),<ref name="EBC">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=Titanium|year=2006|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9072643/titanium|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> lustrous, and metallic-white in [[color]].<ref name="Stwertka1998"/> The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650&nbsp;<U+00B0>C or 3,000&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) makes it useful as a [[Refractory metals|refractory metal]]. It is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and has fairly low [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]].<ref name="EBC"/>

Commercial (99.2% pure) [[Titanium alloy#Grades|grades]] of titanium have [[ultimate tensile strength]] of about 434 [[Megapascal|MPa]] (63,000 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are 45% lighter. Titanium is 60% more dense than aluminium, but more than twice as strong<ref name="Barksdale1968p738"/> as the most commonly used 6061-T6 aluminium alloy. Certain titanium alloys (e.g., [[Titanium_Beta_C|Beta C]]) achieve tensile strengths of over 1400 MPa (200000 psi).<ref>{{cite book|title=Titanium: A Technical Guide|year=1988|author=Matthew J. Donachie, Jr.|publisher=ASM International|location=Metals Park, OH|page=Appendix J, Table J.2|isbn=0-87170-309-2|nopp=true}}</ref>
However, titanium loses strength when heated above {{convert|430|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}.<ref name="Barksdale1968p734">{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=734}}</ref>

Titanium is fairly hard (although not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel), non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, as the material will soften and [[galling|gall]] if sharp tools and proper cooling methods are not used. Like those made from steel, titanium structures have a [[fatigue limit]] which guarantees longevity in some applications.<ref name="Stwertka1998"/> Titanium alloys have lower specific stiffnesses than in many other structural materials such as aluminium alloys and [[carbon fiber]].

The metal is a dimorphic [[allotropy|allotrope]] whose hexagonal alpha form changes into a body-centered cubic (lattice) <U+03B2> form at {{convert|882|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}.<ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/> The [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] of the alpha form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the <U+03B2> form regardless of temperature.<ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/> Similar to zirconium and hafnium, an additional omega phase exists, which is thermodynamically stable at high pressures, but is metastable at ambient pressures. This phase is usually hexagonal (''ideal'') or trigonal (''distorted'') and can be viewed as being due to a soft longitudinal acoustic [[phonon]] of the <U+03B2> phase causing collapse of [[Miller index|(111) planes]] of atoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sikka|first=S. K.|coauthors=Vohra, Y. K., Chidambaram, R.|title=Omega phase in materials|journal=[[Progress in Materials Science]]|year=1982|volume=27|pages=245<U+2013>310|doi=10.1016/0079-6425(82)90002-0|issue=3<U+2013>4}}</ref>

===Chemical properties===
[[File:Titanium in water porbiax diagram.png|thumb|left|The [[Pourbaix diagram]] for titanium in pure water, perchloric acid or sodium hydroxide<ref name="medusa">Puigdomenech, Ignasi (2004) [http://www.kemi.kth.se/medusa/ ''Hydra/Medusa Chemical Equilibrium Database and Plotting Software''], KTH Royal Institute of Technology.</ref>]]
Like [[aluminium]] and [[magnesium]] metal surfaces, titanium metal and its alloys [[oxidize]] immediately upon exposure to air. Nitrogen acts similarly to give a coating of the nitride. Titanium readily reacts with oxygen at {{convert|1200|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in air, and at {{convert|610|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in pure oxygen, forming [[titanium dioxide]].<ref name="TICE6th"/> It is, however, slow to react with water and air, as it forms a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passive]] and oxide coating that protects the bulk metal from further oxidation.<ref name="EBC"/> When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1<U+2013>2 [[nanometre|nm]] thick but continues to slowly grow; reaching a thickness of 25&nbsp;nm in four years.<ref name="Emsley2001p453"/>

Related to its tendency to form a passivating layer, titanium exhibits excellent resistance to corrosion. It is almost as resistant as [[platinum]], capable of withstanding attack by dilute [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]s as well as chloride solutions, and most organic acids.<ref name="LANL"/> However, it is attacked by concentrated acids.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pitting Corrosion of Titanium|journal=J. Electrochem. Soc.|volume=141|issue=3|pages=636<U+2013>642|year=1994|author=Casillas, N.; Charlebois, S.; Smyrl, W. H.; White, H. S.|doi=10.1149/1.2054783}}</ref> As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal.  One indication is that the metal burns before it melting point is reached. Melting is only possible in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At {{convert|550|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}, it combines with chlorine.<ref name="LANL"/> It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.<ref name="HistoryAndUse"/>

Titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at {{convert|800|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} to form [[titanium nitride]], which causes embrittlement.<ref name="titaniumindustry">{{cite book|title=Industrial Applications of Titanium and Zirconium|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=0Adr4zleybgC&pg=PA112|page = 112|first = A. L.|last = Forrest |chapter = Effects of Metal Chemistry on Behavior of Titanium in Industrial Applications|year=1981}}</ref> Because of its high reactivity toward oxygen, nitrogen and many other gases, [[Electrical filament|titanium filaments]] are applied in [[titanium sublimation pump]]s as scavengers for these gases. Such pumps are inexpensive and reliable devices for producing extremely low pressures in [[ultra-high vacuum]] systems.

Titanium is always bonded to other elements in nature. It is the ninth-most [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|abundant]] element in the [[Earth]]'s crust (0.63% by [[mass]])<ref name="Barksdale1968p732"/> and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present in most [[igneous rock]]s and in [[sedimentary rock|sediments]] derived from them (as well as in living things and natural bodies of water).<ref name="EBC"/><ref name="LANL">{{RubberBible86th}}</ref> Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the [[United States Geological Survey]], 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.<ref name="Barksdale1968p732"/>

It is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the [[mineral]]s [[anatase]], [[brookite]], [[ilmenite]], [[perovskite]], [[rutile]] and [[titanite]] (sphene).<ref name="Emsley2001p453">{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=453}}</ref> Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of these minerals have been mined in 2011, respectively.<ref name=USGS/> Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Mozambique]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Ukraine]] and [[South Africa]].<ref name="Emsley2001p453"/> About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.<ref name=USGS/>

Titanium is contained in [[meteorite]]s and has been detected in the [[sun]] and in [[Stellar classification|M-type]] [[star]]s,<ref name="LANL"/> which are the coolest type of star, with a surface temperature of {{convert|3200|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}.<ref name="Emsley2001p451">{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=451}}</ref> [[Rock (geology)|Rocks]] brought back from the [[moon]] during the [[Apollo 17]] mission are composed of 12.1% TiO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="LANL"/> It is also found in [[coal]] ash, [[plant]]s, and even the [[human]] body.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of titanium}}
Naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable [[isotope]]s: <sup>46</sup>Ti, <sup>47</sup>Ti, <sup>48</sup>Ti, <sup>49</sup>Ti, and <sup>50</sup>Ti, with <sup>48</sup>Ti being the most abundant (73.8% [[natural abundance]]). Eleven [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, with the most stable being <sup>44</sup>Ti with a [[half-life]] of 63 years, <sup>45</sup>Ti with a half-life of 184.8 minutes, <sup>51</sup>Ti with a half-life of 5.76 minutes, and <sup>52</sup>Ti with a half-life of 1.7 minutes. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 33 seconds and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half a second.<ref name="EnvChem"/>

The isotopes of titanium range in [[atomic weight]] from 39.99 [[unified atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>40</sup>Ti) to 57.966 u (<sup>58</sup>Ti). The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, <sup>48</sup>Ti, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta emission]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before <sup>48</sup>Ti are element 21 ([[scandium]]) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 ([[vanadium]]) isotopes.<ref name="EnvChem"/>

Titanium becomes radioactive upon bombardment with [[deuterons]], emitting mainly [[positrons]] and hard [[gamma rays]].<ref name="LANL"/>

{{Category see also|Titanium compounds|Titanium minerals}}
[[File:Titanium nitride coating.jpg|thumb|left|50px|alt=A steel colored twist drill bit with the spiral groove colored in a golden shade.|TiN-coated [[drill]] bit]]
The +4 [[oxidation state]] dominates titanium chemistry,<ref name="Greenwood1997p958">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=958}}</ref> but compounds in the +3 [[oxidation state]] are also common.<ref name="Greenwood1997p970">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=970}}</ref> Commonly, titanium adopts an [[octahedral coordination geometry]] in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl<sub>4</sub> is a notable exception. Because of the high oxidation state of Ti(IV), titanium(IV) compounds exhibit a high degree of [[covalent bond]]ing.

===Oxides, sulfides, and alkoxides===
The most important oxide is TiO<sub>2</sub>, which exists in three important [[polymorph]]s, [[anatase]], [[brookite]], and [[rutile]]. All of these are white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see [[rutile]]). The adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six [[oxide]] ligands that link to other Ti centers.  [[Titanate]]s usually refers to compounds made from titanium dioxide, as represented [[barium titanate]] (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>), which is produced synthetically.  With a [[perovskite]] structure, this material exhibits [[piezoelectric]] properties and  is used as a transducer in the interconversion of [[sound]] and [[electricity]].<ref name="TICE6th"/>  Many minerals are titanates, e.g. [[illmenite]] (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>). [[Star sapphire (jewel)|Star sapphires]] and [[ruby|rubies]] get their [[Asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.<ref name="Emsley2001p453"/>

The [[alkoxide]]s of titanium(IV) are useful compounds that convert to the dioxide. They are volatile, colourless compounds that are sensitive to water. [[Titanium ethoxide]], with the molecular formula Ti<sub>4</sub>(OEt)<sub>16</sub>, reacts with water to deposit solid TiO<sub>2</sub> via the [[sol-gel process]]. [[Titanium isopropoxide]] is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the [[Sharpless epoxidation]].

Titanium forms a variety of sulfides, but only [[titanium disulfide|TiS<sub>2</sub>]] has attracted significant interest.  It adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in early generation of [[lithium batteries]]. Since Ti(IV) is a [[HSAB theory|"hard cation"]], the sulfides of titanium are unstable in the presence of moisture, tending to hydrolyze to the oxide and hydrogen sulfide.

===Nitrides, carbides ===
[[Titanium nitride]] (TiN), having a hardness equivalent to [[sapphire]] and [[carborundum]] (9.0 on the [[Mohs Scale]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~schubert/Educational-resources/Materials-Hardness.pdf |title=The hardness scale introduced by Friederich Mohs|author=Schubert, E.F.}}</ref> is often used to coat cutting tools, such as [[drill bit]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Truini|first=Joseph|title=Drill Bits|journal=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|volume=165|date=1988-05|issue=5|page=91|issn=0032-4558|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Z-QDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> It also finds use as a gold-colored decorative finish, and as a [[Copper-based chips#Barrier metal|barrier metal]] in [[semiconductor fabrication]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baliga|first=B.

===Halides===
[[Titanium tetrachloride]] (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl<sub>4</sub><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tIPFfYW304IC&pg=PA10|page=10|title=Titanium: industrial base, price trends, and technology initiatives|author=Seong, S.

[[Image:TiCl3.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Titanium(III) compounds are characteristically violet, illustrated by this aqueous solution of [[titanium trichloride]].]]

Titanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable chlorides.  A notable example is [[titanium(III) chloride]] (TiCl<sub>3</sub>), which is used as a [[catalyst]] for production of [[polyolefin]]s (see [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]) and a reducing [[reagent|agent]] in organic chemistry.

===Organometallic complexes===
{{main|Organotitanium chemistry}}
Owing to the important role of titanium compounds as polymerization catalyst, compounds with Ti-C bonds have been intensively studied.  The most common organotitanium complex is [[titanocene dichloride]] ((C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>TiCl<sub>2</sub>).  Related compounds include [[Tebbe's reagent]] and [[Petasis reagent]].  Titanium forms carbonyl complexes, e.g. [[titanocene dicarbonyl|(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ti(CO)<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>Hartwig, J. F.

==History==
[[File:Martin Heinrich Klaproth.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Engraved profile image of a mid-age male with high forehead. The person is wearing a coat and a neckerchief.|[[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] named titanium for the [[titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]].]]
Titanium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] [[Inclusion (mineral)|included]] in a [[mineral]] in [[Cornwall]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], in 1791 by the [[clergy]]man and amateur geologist [[William Gregor]], then vicar of [[Creed, Cornwall|Creed]] parish.<ref name="Emsley2001p452" /> He recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite<ref name="HistoryAndUse"/> when he found black sand by a stream in the nearby [[parish]] of [[Manaccan]] and noticed the sand was attracted by a [[magnet]].<ref name="Emsley2001p452" /> Analysis of the sand determined the presence of two metal oxides; [[iron oxide]] (explaining the attraction to the magnet) and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify.<ref name="Barksdale1968p732">{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=732}}</ref> Gregor, realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match the properties of any known element, reported his findings to the [[Royal Geological Society of Cornwall]] and in the German science journal ''[[Crell's Annalen]]''.<ref name="Emsley2001p452" /><!--<ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.de/books?id=pqc5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>-->

Around the same time, [[Franz-Joseph M<U+00FC>ller von Reichenstein]] produced a similar substance, but could not identify it.<ref name="HistoryAndUse"/> The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by [[Prussia]]n chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in rutile from Boinik (German name of unknown place) village of [[Hungary]] (Now in [[Slovakia]]).<ref name="Emsley2001p452" /> Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the [[titan (mythology)|Titans]] of [[Greek mythology]].<ref name="Emsley2001p451"/> After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of ''manaccanite'' and confirmed it contained titanium.

The processes required to extract titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; it is not possible to reduce the ore in the normal manner, by heating in the presence of [[carbon]], as that produces [[titanium carbide]].<ref name="Emsley2001p452" /> Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by [[Matthew A. Hunter]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] by heating TiCl<sub>4</sub> with [[sodium]] at 700<U+2013>800&nbsp;<U+00B0>C in the [[Hunter process]].<ref name="LANL"/> Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when [[William Justin Kroll]] proved that it could be produced by reducing [[titanium tetrachloride]] (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) with [[calcium]].<ref name="Greenwood1997p955">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=955}}</ref> Eight years later he refined this process by using [[magnesium]] and even [[sodium]] in what became known as the [[Kroll process]].<ref name="Greenwood1997p955"/> Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., [[FFC Cambridge]]), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.<ref name="LANL"/><ref name="HistoryAndUse"/>

Because the metal reacts with oxygen at high temperatures it cannot be produced by [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of its dioxide.<ref name="Stwertka1998">{{cite book|title=Guide to the Elements|edition=Revised|first=Albert|last=Stwertka|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1998|chapter=Titanium|pages= 81<U+2013>82|isbn=0-19-508083-1}}</ref> Titanium metal is therefore produced commercially by the [[Kroll process]], a complex and expensive [[batch production|batch process]]. (The relatively high market value of titanium is mainly due to its processing, which sacrifices another expensive metal, magnesium.<ref name="Barksdale1968p733">{{harvnb|Barksdale|1968|p=733}}</ref>) In the Kroll process, the oxide is first converted to chloride through carbochlorination, whereby [[chlorine]] gas is passed over red-hot rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon to make [[Titanium tetrachloride|TiCl<sub>4</sub>]].

This method uses titanium dioxide powder (which is a refined form of rutile) as feedstock to make the end product which is either a powder or sponge. If mixed oxide powders are used, the product is an alloy manufactured at a much lower cost than the conventional multi-step melting process. The FFC Cambridge process may render titanium a less rare and expensive material for the [[aerospace]] industry and the luxury goods market, and could be seen in many products currently manufactured using aluminium and specialist grades of steel.

Common titanium [[alloy]]s are made by reduction. For example, cuprotitanium (rutile with [[copper]] added is reduced), ferrocarbon titanium (ilmenite reduced with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in an electric furnace), and manganotitanium (rutile with manganese or manganese oxides) are reduced.<ref name="TI_Encarta2005">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Titanium|encyclopedia=Microsoft Encarta|year=2005|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569280/Titanium.html|accessdate=2006-12-29|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061027112633/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761569280/Titanium.html |archivedate = October 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In terms of fabrication, all [[welding]] of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of [[argon]] or [[helium]] in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases such as oxygen, [[nitrogen]], or [[hydrogen]].<ref name="Barksdale1968p734"/> Contamination will cause a variety of conditions, such as [[embrittlement]], which will reduce the integrity of the assembly welds and lead to joint failure.

Welded titanium pipe and process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) are used in the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in downhole and [[nickel]] [[hydrometallurgy]] applications due to their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or combination of both.

[[Titanium tetrachloride]] (TiCl<sub>4</sub>), a colorless liquid, is important as an intermediate in the process of making TiO<sub>2</sub> and is also used to produce the [[Ziegler-Natta]] catalyst, and is used to iridize [[glass]] and because it fumes strongly in moist air it is also used to make smoke screens.<ref name="Stwertka1998"/>

===Consumer and architectural===
Titanium metal is used in automotive applications, particularly in automobile or motorcycle racing, where weight reduction is critical while maintaining high strength and rigidity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Tom|coauthors=''et al.''|title=Heat Treating|publisher=ASM International|year=2001|series=Proceedings of the 20th Conference, 9<U+2013>12 October 2000|page=141|isbn=0-87170-727-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4F1zYT4FHyMC}}</ref> The metal is generally too expensive to make it marketable to the general consumer market, other than high-end products, particularly for the racing/performance market. Late model [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvettes]] have been available with titanium exhausts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iglou.com/corvette/specs/2001/exhaust.htm|title=Titanium Exhausts|accessdate=2006-12-26|author=National Corvette Museum|year=2006}}</ref>

Titanium is used in many sporting goods: [[tennis racket]]s, [[golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]], [[lacrosse]] stick shafts; [[cricket]], hockey, lacrosse, and football helmet grills; and [[bicycle]] frames and components. Although not a mainstream material for bicycle production, titanium bikes have been used by race teams and [[Adventure Cycling|adventure cyclists]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Joseph R.|title=Metals Handbook|publisher=ASM International|year=1998|page=584|isbn=0-87170-654-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IpEnvBtSfPQC}}</ref> Titanium alloys are also used in [[glasses|spectacle]] frames.<ref name="Donachie2000">{{cite book|last=Donachie|first=Matthew J.|title=Titanium: A Technical Guide|publisher=ASM International|year=2000|pages=11, 255|isbn=0-87170-686-5}}</ref> This results in a rather expensive, but highly durable and long lasting frame which is light in weight and causes no skin allergies. Many [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]] use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes.<ref name="Donachie2000" /> Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, these titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium is also favored for use by [[farrier]]s, since it is lighter and more durable than steel when formed into [[horseshoe]]s.<ref name="Donachie2000" />

Titanium has occasionally been used in architectural applications: the 40 m (131&nbsp;foot) memorial to [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first man to travel in space, in [[Moscow]], is made of titanium for the metal's attractive color and association with rocketry.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=41EqJFxjA4wC&pg=PA408|title=Titanium| chapter = Appearance Related Applications|isbn=978-3-540-71397-5|author1=L<U+00FC>tjering, Gerd|author2=Williams, James Case|date=2007-06-12}}</ref> The [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] and the [[Cerritos Millennium Library]] were the first buildings in Europe and North America, respectively, to be sheathed in titanium panels.<ref name="Emsley2001p454">{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=454}}</ref> Other construction uses of titanium sheathing include the Frederic C.

Because of its superior strength and light weight when compared to other metals traditionally used in firearms (steel, [[stainless steel]], and aluminium), and advances in metalworking techniques, the use of titanium has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms. Primary uses include [[pistol]] frames and [[revolver]] cylinders. For these same reasons, it is also used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s PowerBook line).<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-08|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/stats/powerbook_g4_400.html|title=Apple PowerBook G4 400 (Original <U+2013> Ti) Specs|work=everymac.com}}</ref>

Some upmarket categories of tools made to be lightweight and corrosion-resistant, such as shovels and flashlights, are made of titanium or titanium alloys as well.

===Jewelry===
Because of its durability, titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, [[titanium ring]]s).<ref name="Donachie2000" /> Its inertness makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also [[Titanium gold|alloyed with gold]] to produce an alloy that can be marketed as [[Carat (purity)|24-carat]] gold, as the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and thus is more durable than a pure 24-carat gold item would be.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.goldbulletin.org/assets/file/goldbulletin/downloads/Gafner_4_22.pdf |title=The development of 990 Gold-Titanium: its Production, use and Properties |author=Gafner, G. |journal=Gold Bulletin |year=1989 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=112<U+2013>122 |doi=10.1007/BF03214709}}</ref>

Titanium's durability, light weight, dent- and corrosion resistance makes it useful in the production of [[watch]] cases.<ref name="Donachie2000" /> Some artists work with titanium to produce artworks such as sculptures, decorative objects and furniture.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-08|url=http://www.titanium-arts.com/home.html|title=Fine Art and Functional Works in Titanium and Other Earth Elements}}</ref>

The inertness and ability to be attractively colored makes titanium a popular metal for use in [[body piercing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorgoodskin.com/tp/bodypiercing/|work=doctorgoodskin.com |title=Body Piercing Safety |accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref> Titanium may be [[Anodising|anodized]] to produce various colors, which varies the thickness of the surface oxide layer and causes [[interference fringe]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/ed/encycl/art-a02-anodizing.htm |title=Electrochemistry Encyclopedia |author=Alwitt, Robert S. |year=2002|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref>

===Medical===
Because it is [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] (it is non-toxic and is not rejected by the body), titanium is used in a gamut of medical applications including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets ([[joint replacement]]) that can stay in place for up to 20 years.<ref name="Emsley2001p452">{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=452}}</ref> The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totaljoints.info/orthopaedic_metal_alloys.htm|title=Orthopaedic Metal Alloys|publisher=Totaljoints.info|accessdate=2010-09-27}}</ref> or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.

Titanium has the inherent ability to [[osseointegration|osseointegrate]], enabling use in [[dental implants]] that can remain in place for over 30 years. This property is also useful for [[internal fixator|orthopedic implant]] applications.<ref name="Emsley2001p452"/> These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity ([[Young's modulus]]) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still more than twice that of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010/09/titanium-foams-replace-injured-bones.jsp|title=Titanium foams replace injured bones|journal=Research News |date=September 2010|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|accessdate=2010-09-27}}</ref>

Since titanium is non-[[ferromagnetic]], patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.<ref name="Emsley2001p452"/>

Titanium is also used for the [[surgical instrument]]s used in [[image-guided surgery]], as well as wheelchairs, crutches, and any other products where high strength and low weight are desirable.

Due to its extreme corrosion resistance, titanium containers have been studied for the long-term storage of nuclear waste (containers lasting over 100,000 years are possible under proper manufacturing conditions to reduce defects in the process).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://sun.chem.uwo.ca/content/hydrogen-absorption-and-lifetime-performance-titanium-nuclear-waste-containers|title=Hydrogen absorption and the lifetime performance of titanium nuclear waste containers|journal=Corrosion Reviews|date=Volume 18, 2000|publisher=University of Western Ontario, Authors Shoesmith DW, No<U+00EB>l JJ, Hardie D, Ikeda BM|accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> A titanium "drip shield" could also be placed over other types of containers to further contain the waste.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/garcia1/ see footnote 6|title=Proof of Safety at Yucca Mountain|journal=Science|date=Volume 310, 2005|publisher=L.

==Precautions==
[[File:Kopiva.JPG|thumb|alt=The dark green dentated elliptic leaves of a nettle|[[Urtica dioica|nettle]] contains up to 80 parts per million of titanium.]]
Titanium is non-toxic even in large doses and does not play any natural role inside the [[human body]].<ref name="Emsley2001p451" /> An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed.<ref name="Emsley2001p451"/> It does, however, have a tendency to [[bio-accumulate]] in tissues that contain [[silica]]. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and [[yellow nail syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berglund|first=Fredrik|coauthors=Bjorn Carlmark|title=Titanium, Sinusitis, and the Yellow Nail Syndrome|journal=Biological Trace Element Research|date=October 2011|pmc=3176400|volume=143|issue=1|pages=1<U+2013>7|doi=10.1007/s12011-010-8828-5|pmid=20809268}}</ref> An unknown mechanism in [[plant]]s may use titanium to stimulate the production of [[carbohydrate]]s and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 [[part per million]] (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and [[horsetail]] and [[Urtica|nettle]] contain up to 80 ppm.<ref name="Emsley2001p451" />

As a powder or in the form of metal shavings, titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in [[air]], an explosion hazard.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cotell |first=Catherine Mary |coauthors=Sprague, J. A.; Smidt, F. A. |title=ASM Handbook: Surface Engineering |publisher=ASM International |year=1994 |edition=10th |page=836 |isbn=0-87170-384-X |url=http://books.google.com/?id=RGtsPjqUwy0C}}</ref> Water and [[carbon dioxide]]<U+2013>based methods to extinguish fires are ineffective on burning titanium; [[fire classes|Class D]] dry powder fire fighting agents must be used instead.<ref name="HistoryAndUse"/>

When used in the production or handling of [[chlorine]], care must be taken to use titanium only in locations where it will not be exposed to dry chlorine gas which can result in a titanium/chlorine fire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Compressed Gas Association|title=Handbook of compressed gases|publisher=Springer|year=1999|edition=4th|page=323|isbn=0-412-78230-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WSLULtCG9JgC}}</ref> A fire hazard exists even when titanium is used in wet chlorine due to possible unexpected drying brought about by extreme weather conditions.

Titanium can catch fire when a fresh, non-oxidized surface comes in contact with [[liquid oxygen]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Robert E.|others=National Fire Prevention Association|title=Fire and Life Safety Inspection Manual|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|year=2002|edition=8th|page=45|isbn=0-87765-472-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2fHsoobsCNwC}}</ref> Such surfaces can appear when the oxidized surface is struck with a hard object, or when a mechanical strain causes the emergence of a crack. This poses the possible limitation for its use in liquid oxygen systems, such as those found in the aerospace industry.
