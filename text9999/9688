'''Musca''' ({{lang-la|[[fly]]}}) is a small [[constellation]] in the deep southern sky. It was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14&nbsp;in) diameter [[globe#Celestial|celestial globe]] published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a [[Celestial cartography|celestial atlas]] was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603. It was also known as '''Apis''' ({{lang-la|[[bee]]}}) for two hundred years. Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.

Many of the constellation's brighter stars are members of the [[Scorpius<U+2013>Centaurus Association]], a loose group of hot blue-white stars that appear to share a common origin and motion across the [[Milky Way]]. These include [[Alpha Muscae|Alpha]], [[Beta Muscae|Beta]], [[Gamma Muscae|Gamma]], [[Zeta2 Muscae|Zeta<sup>2</sup>]] and (likely) [[Eta Muscae]], as well as [[HD 100546]], a blue-white [[Herbig Ae/Be star]] that is surrounded by a complex [[debris disk]] containing a large [[exoplanet|planet]] or [[brown dwarf]] and possible protoplanet. Two further star systems have been found to have planets. The constellation also contains two [[Classical Cepheid variable|Cepheid variables]] visible to the naked eye. [[Theta Muscae]] is a triple star system, the brightest member of which is a [[Wolf<U+2013>Rayet star]].

== History ==
Musca was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]], who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1598 under the Dutch name ''De Vlieghe'', "The Fly".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref> They assigned four stars to the constellation, with a star that would be later designated as Beta Muscae marking the head, Gamma the body, and Alpha and Delta the left and right wings respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | title = On Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue of Southern Stars, and the Origin of the Southern Constellations | author= [[Edward Knobel|Knobel, Edward B.]] |journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume= 77| pages=414<U+2013>32 [426] | bibcode = 1917MNRAS..77..414K |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1917MNRAS..77..414K/0000414.000.html |year=1917}}</ref> It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&nbsp;in) diameter [[globe#Celestial|celestial globe]] published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]], though was unnamed.<ref name=musca/> The first depiction of this constellation in a [[Celestial cartography|celestial atlas]] was in the German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 20 December 2013}}</ref><!-- cites previous three sentences --> though Bayer termed it Apis<U+2014>''the Bee'', a name by which it was known for the next two centuries.

The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] called it ''la Mouche'' on the 1756 version of his [[planisphere]] of the southern skies.

Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the [[Bayer designation]]s Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became [[Lambda Muscae|Lambda]] and [[Mu Muscae|Mu]] but did not designate them as he considered them ''informes'' as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. [[Francis Baily]] also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as [[Zeta1 Muscae|Zeta<sup>1</sup>]] and [[Zeta2 Muscae|Zeta<sup>2</sup>]]. These last two stars are 1<U+00B0> apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation.<ref name=wagman>{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, Virginia  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=213<U+2013>14}}</ref><!-- cites seven previous sentences --> Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.<ref name=tirionconst/>
