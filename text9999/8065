The murder of '''Robert Eric Wone''' is a murder case in [[Washington, D.C.]], that remains unsolved; the body was found in the home of a college friend in August 2006. Wone, who was 32 years old at the time, was a lawyer living in suburban [[Oakton, Virginia|Oakton]], [[Virginia]] but had been working as general counsel at [[Radio Free Asia]] in downtown Washington, D.C. and stayed the night at the home of friends located about one mile from his office. According to police affidavits, Wone was believed to have been "restrained, incapacitated, and sexually assaulted" before his death.

Within weeks of the murder, [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|D.C. police]] alleged that the crime scene had been tampered with, but no charges were filed for over two years. The residents present in the townhouse when Wone was attacked were charged in late 2008 with [[obstruction of justice]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] related to alleged crime scene tampering. The men were acquitted of the charges in June, 2010. The men have not been charged with Wone's killing, but his widow has filed a $20 million [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against them.

==The victim==
'''Robert Eric Wone''' (June 1, 1974 &ndash; August 3, 2006) was a fourth generation [[Chinese American]], born and raised in [[New York City]].<ref name=aw />  After graduating from [[Xaverian High School]] as [[salutatorian]] of his class, he attended [[The College of William and Mary]].

==The homicide==
Late on August 2, 2006, Wone was fatally stabbed while staying overnight at a Swann Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] townhouse in Washington, D.C., owned by Joseph Price and his [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the District of Columbia|domestic partner]] Victor Zaborsky,<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news|title=Looking Straight at Gay Parents|last=Peterson|first=Karen S.|date=2004-03-09|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|accessdate=2009-01-06|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2004-03-09-gay-parents_x.htm}}</ref> where Dylan Ward also resided.<ref name=post061008 />  Wone had gone to Price's residence at approximately 10:30 P.M. after working late, as had been arranged days before.<ref name=post061008>{{cite news|title=A New Glimpse Into Night of D.C.

Price, Ward, and Zaborsky all initially spoke with the police without attorneys, and video recordings of those interviews were shown at the subsequent conspiracy trial.<ref name="Babay">{{cite web|last=Babay|first=Emily|title=Wone conspiracy trial could wrap up this week|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/local/Wone-conspiracy-trial-could-wrap-up-this-week-96758449.html|work=Washington Examiner|publisher=Washington Examiner|accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref>  They denied any involvement in the death and speculated that an intruder had killed Wone.<ref name=post061008 />  The three have also denied any sexual relationship with Wone,<ref name=aw /> and Wone's family have described him as both "straight and happily married."<ref name=blade1205 />  Price, Ward, and Zaborsky attended Wone's funeral, where Price served as a pallbearer.<ref name=post061008 />  [[Eric Holder]], who worked at that time at Covington & Burling, called Wone "a kind and gentle man" who was "killed in the most horrible of ways".<ref name=aw />

==Investigation==

Paramedics responding to the emergency call "found the three residents<U+2019> calm behavior unusual; none was screaming or even helping direct the paramedics."<ref name=aw /> According to Ward's attorney, detectives who interrogated the three housemates the night of the murder informed them that they were the main suspects in the case, and asked many sexually charged, accusatory questions.<ref name=wtop20081125>{{cite news|title=A third not-guilty plea in D.C. lawyer death|publisher=''WTOP Radio''|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=2009-01-06|url=http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=25&sid=1525831}}</ref> Three days after the murder, the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit of the D.C. police were called in, but unit head Sgt.

===Burglary===
Three months after Wone's death, there was a burglary at the Swann Street residence, in which more than $7,000 of electronic equipment was taken.<ref name=post070805>{{cite news|title=Year Later, Lawyer's Slaying Still Shrouded in Mystery; Widow to Plead for Witnesses to Speak Out on Husband's Death in Attempt to Raise Investigation's Profile|last=Klein|first=Allison|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=2007-08-05|accessdate=2009-01-04|url= http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1315169781&sid=1&Fmt=3&clientId=20886&RQT=309&VName=PQD|page=C.6}} (Registration required)</ref><ref name=blade0808 />  Two individuals, including a close relative of Price's,<ref name=law1>{{cite news|title=A Year Later, Police Still Don't Know Who Killed D.C.

===Lack of progress===
In August 2007 the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported Katherine Wone's frustration with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory|FBI crime lab]], "It has been trying at times as we continue to wait for the FBI to complete their analysis of all the samples that were taken."<ref name=post070805 /> Over one year the case had been transferred to three separate prosecutors, earning it "[[vagabond]] status" in the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorneys']] office.<ref name=law1 /> On the one-year anniversary of Wone's death, Katherine Wone held a press conference to appeal for public assistance in finding the  killer, her first public comment on the case.<ref name=post070805 /><ref name=examiner /> During the press conference, Holder publicly pleaded with the three residents to provide additional information, saying "You need to ask yourself, 'Have I provided police with all the information I know?'"<ref name=examiner>{{cite news|title=Wone<U+2019>s wife pleads for killer to reveal himself |first=Scott |last=McCabe |url=http://www.examiner.com/a-867688~Wone_s_wife_pleads_for_killer_to_reveal_himself.html |date=2007-08-07|accessdate=2008-01-04|publisher=''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]''}}</ref><ref name=wapost>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080600773.html |title=Lawyer's Wife Pleads for Killer to Step Forward|date=2007-08-07|page=B04|accessdate=2009-02-08|last=Klein|first=Allison|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}</ref> Interested parties, such as the [[Organization of Chinese Americans|OCA]], used the first anniversary of Wone's death to criticize what they deemed as police inaction in the investigation.<ref name=oca /> In contrast to the first anniversary of Wone's murder, there was no press conference on the second anniversary, and neither the Wone family nor police made any statements to the press.<ref name=blade0808 />

===Arrests and charges===
An obstruction of justice charge was filed in October 2008 against housemate Dylan Ward, who had since moved to [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] and was living in a home owned by Price.<ref name=washblade /> In November 2008, Price and Zaborsky were arrested and also charged with obstruction of justice.<ref name=blade1205 />  All three men were later released pending trial, but subject to electronic monitoring and curfews.<ref name=blade1205 />  On December 19, 2008, additional charges of conspiracy were filed against all three men.<ref name=fox1219>{{cite news|title=New Charges Filed in Death of D.C.

The affidavit filed by authorities supporting the arrest warrant for Ward showed that investigators had concluded the men were not telling the truth about what happened. The report states "The evidence demonstrates that Robert Wone was restrained, incapacitated, sexually assaulted, and murdered inside 1509 Swann Street,"<ref name=washblade>{{citenews |url=http://www.washblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=22079 |title=Police say Wone was drugged, sexually assaulted before murder |first=Lou|last=Chibbaro Jr. |publisher=''[[The Washington Blade]]'' |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> and there exists "overwhelming evidence, far in excess of probable cause" that Price, Zaborsky, and Ward "obstructed justice by altering and orchestrating the crime scene, planting evidence, delaying the reporting of the murder to the authorities, and lying to the police about the true circumstances of the murder."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202425723647 |title=Arrest Made in Murder of Washington Lawyer |first=Joe|last=Palazzolo|coauthors=Mike Scarcella |date=2008-11-03 |publisher=Law.com |accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> Lawyers for the three accused men have called the affidavit "speculation, innuendo, assumptions, and irrelevant inflammatory comments" and maintain their clients' innocence.<ref name=blade1205>{{cite news|title=Gay Defendants Blast officials in Wone Case: Police Accused of Spreading <U+2018>Inflammatory Comments<U+2019>|publisher=''[[The Washington Blade]]'' |date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=2009-01-01|first=Lou|last=Chibbaro Jr.|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2008/12-5/news/localnews/13684.cfm}}</ref> Price and Zaborsky were domestic partners,<ref name=blade0808 /> and the affidavit alleges that Price had previously had a sexual relationship with Ward.<ref name=washblade /> Washington attorney Dale Sanders opined that the release of the extensively detailed affidavit was intended to turn one of the housemates, presumably Ward, against the others, and hypothesized that it indicated prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to charge any of the housemates with additional crimes without the cooperation of a witness.<ref name=washblade/>

Officials believe that a knife from the kitchen had been smeared with blood placed near the body, while a duplicate of the knife which was missing from a set found in Ward's bedroom would have been more consistent with the wounds to Wone's body. The autopsy revealed evidence of some degree of suffocation, perhaps by a pillow, and puncture marks on his neck, chest, foot and hand. Though no toxins were found in his blood, a lack of evidence of struggle led investigators to suspect Wone had been injected with a paralytic agent. [[Cadaver dog]]s found a blood residue in a dryer lint trap and the patio drain, which detectives believe may be evidence that someone washed themselves in the back patio area, and dried wet clothes in the dryer.<ref name=exposessecrets>{{citenews |url=http://www.news8.net/news/stories/1008/566109.html |title='Obstruction' Affidavit Exposes Secrets of D.C.

In April, 2009, prosecutors disclosed that two emails had been sent from Wone's [[BlackBerry]] "at a time when prosecutors believed Wone dead".<ref name=blade0509>{{cite news|title=Missing e-Mails at Issue in Wone Murder: Timing of Deleted Messages Could Have Aided Defense: Attorneys|last=Chibbaro, Jr.|first=Lou|work=[[Washington Blade]]|date=2009-05-01|accessdate=2009-05-20|url=http://www.washblade.com/2009/5-1/news/localnews/14453.cfm}}</ref> An independent criminal law attorney noted that "The defense will argue that this is consistent with their claim that the murder happened quickly by an intruder and it was not a long, drawn-out effort to sexually assault Wone before he was killed, as the government is alleging."<ref name=blade0509/> Previously a court filing indicated the government intended to release a personal profile that Price allegedly used on ALT.com, "a sexually oriented web site specializing in [[BDSM|S&M]] practices".<ref name=blade0509/>

Formal defense in the conspiracy case began on June 17, 2010, and concluded without any of the defendants testifying.  According to legal analyst [[David Benowitz]], in the light of the recorded interviews with police the day after the murder, allowing the defendants to testify could have harmed the case.<ref name=Babay />

Judge Lynn Leibovitz found each of the three men not guilty of charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and tampering with evidence on June 29, 2010.<ref name="acquitted">{{cite news|title=Judge rules not guilty in Wone case|author=Keith Alexander|work=The Washington Post|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/keith-l-alexander/wone-verdict-expected-tuesday.html|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>  Leibovitz, in explaining her ruling for almost an hour from the bench, stated that she personally believed that the men knew who killed Wone, but was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that they committed the offenses with which they were charged.<ref name=acquitted />

===Civil lawsuit===
On November 25, 2008, Wone's widow Katherine filed a $20 million [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against the three men, largely based on the police affidavit. The lawsuit alleges "defendants' negligent failure to rescue Robert Wone after he was injured, defendants' destruction of evidence of Robert Wone<U+2019>s murder, and defendants' conspiracy to destroy evidence and obstruct the police investigation into Robert Wone<U+2019>s murder."<ref name=blade1205 /> Prior to his nomination as [[United States Attorney General]], Wone's widow was advised by [[Eric Holder]] as a [[Pro bono publico|pro bono]] legal advisor;<ref name=post061008 /><ref name=sj>{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/resources/documents/upload/111th-Holder-Questionnaire-Public.pdf |title=Questionnaire for Eric Holder, Jr., Attorney General Nominee|publisher=[[United States Senate]] [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]]|accessdate=2009-01-03|format=pdf}} (Section 26, near end of document)</ref> and the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' referred to Holder as her "chief attorney" in 2008.<ref name=blade0808 />
