'''Michael Keller Ditka, Jr.''' (born October 18, 1939 in [[Carnegie, Pennsylvania]]), also known as '''"Iron Mike"''', is a former [[American football]] [[National Football League|NFL]] player, television commentator, and coach.<!-- Please do not edit [[Tony Dungy]] here. He was the son of a Polish-Ukrainian father and an Irish-German mother. <sup>[http://www.polishsportshof.com/bios/ditka_m_complete.html]</sup> He did not win a Super Bowl as an assistant coach. Please see this talkpage. --> Ditka coached the [[Chicago Bears]] for 11 years and [[New Orleans Saints]] for three years. Ditka and [[Tom Flores]] are the only two people to win [[Super Bowl]]s as a player, an assistant coach, and a head coach.  Ditka was the only individual to participate in both of the last two Chicago Bears' championships, as a player in [[1963 NFL season|1963]] and as head coach in [[1985 NFL season|1985]].<!-- Please do not edit [[Tony Dungy]] here. He did not win a Super Bowl as an assistant coach. Please see this talkpage. -->

==Early life and college career==
Ditka was born as Michael Dyczko in the [[Pittsburgh]]-area town of Carnegie on October 18, 1939. The oldest child of Mike Sr. and Charlottte, he grew up in nearby [[Aliquippa, Pennsylvania]]{{r|price20110131}} with siblings Ashton, David, and Mary Ann. Mike Sr., a welder, was one of three brothers of a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/hof-ditka.asp Mike Ditka page on ChicagoBears.com]</ref> family in the coal mining and steel manufacturing area in Western Pennsylvania. The surname "Dyczko" was difficult to pronounce in his hometown, so the family name was changed to "Ditka."<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Ditka attended St. Titus School.

A three-sport star at [[Aliquippa High School]], Ditka hoped to escape his hometown's manufacturing jobs by attending college with a football scholarship. Planning to become a dentist,<ref name=price20110131>{{cite news|last=Price|first=S.L.|title=The Heart Of Football Beats In Aliquippa|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&title=Over+five+decades+of+economic+decline+and+racial+conflict,+-+01.31.11+-+SI+Vault&urlID=445388322&action=cpt&partnerID=289881&fb=Y&url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1181210/index.htm|accessdate=2011-02-06|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|date=2011-01-31}}</ref> he was recruited by [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], [[Penn State]], and [[University of Pittsburgh|Pitt]]. Ditka played for the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1958<U+2013>1960, where he also became a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity. He started all three seasons and is widely considered one of the best [[tight end]]s in college football history. In addition to playing tight end, he also served as the team's punter.  He led the team in receiving in all three of his seasons with them and was a first team selection on the [[College Football All-America Team]] in his senior year. In 1986, he was enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].

He has four children with his first wife Marge: Mike, Mark, Megan, and Matt.  He and Marge divorced in 1973, and he married his second wife Diana in 1977.

==Playing career==
===Chicago Bears===
The [[Chicago Bears]] drafted Ditka fifth overall in the [[1961 NFL Draft]], while the Houston Oilers drafted him eighth overall in the first round in the [[1961 AFL Draft]].  He signed with the Bears and his presence was immediately felt. In his first season, Ditka had 58 receptions, introducing a new dimension to a tight end position that had previously been dedicated to blocking. His success earned him [[UPI NFL-NFC Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors. He continued to play for the Bears for the next five years, earning a [[Pro Bowl]] trip each season. He played on the [[1963 NFL season|1963]] NFL championship team. Many of the players from that team, including Ditka, were drafted by assistant coach [[George Allen (football)|George Allen]], a future Hall of Famer, who was then in charge of the Bears drafts.

===Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys===
Ditka was traded to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in [[1967 NFL season|1967]], where he spent two seasons, before being shipped off to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[1969 NFL season|1969]]. He spent four seasons with the Cowboys, highlighted by a touchdown reception in the Cowboys' 24&ndash;3 victory over the [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VI]].

===Hall of Fame Enshrinement===
In [[1988 NFL season|1988]],<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/years.html years - Pro Football Hall of Fame<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> his fearsome blocking and 427 career receptions for 5,812 yards and 43 touchdowns earned him the honor of being the first tight end ever inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. Ditka also scored two touchdowns on offensive fumble recoveries, tying seven other players for the most in NFL history. In [[1999 NFL season|1999]], he was ranked number 90 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

==Coaching career==
Retiring after the [[1972 NFL season|1972]] season, Ditka was immediately hired as an assistant coach by Cowboys' head coach [[Tom Landry]]. Ditka spent nine seasons as an assistant coach with the Cowboys. During his tenure, the Cowboys made the playoffs eight times, won six division titles and three NFC Championships, including the one preceding their [[Super Bowl XII|Super Bowl victory]] in [[1977 NFL season|1977]].

===Chicago Bears===
In [[1982 NFL season|1982]], Chicago Bears founder [[George Halas]] personally sought out Ditka to take over the head coaching reins, and reverse what had been a mostly dreary performance by the team in the years since Halas retired as head coach. Reversing the Bears' pitiful record of only two winning seasons in the previous nineteen, Ditka led the Bears to six NFC Central titles and three trips to the [[NFC Championship Game]]. Ditka's coaching career hit its pinnacle on January 26, 1986 with a 46&ndash;10 trouncing of the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XX]] at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. Ditka has stated that one of his biggest regrets in life was not letting [[Walter Payton]] score a touchdown in the Super Bowl, insteading opting for [[Jim McMahon]] to run it in twice and rookie defensive tackle [[William "The Refrigerator" Perry]] to run it in once. Football commentators widely regard the 1985 Bears defense as one of the best ever, which was masterminded by defensive coordinator, [[Buddy Ryan]], with little oversight from Ditka. In an unusual gesture, following the Bears Super Bowl victory, Ryan, as well as Ditka, was carried off the field by team members. In addition, the 1985 Chicago Bears are one of the few teams who consistently challenge the undefeated [[1972 NFL Season|1972]] [[Miami Dolphins]] for the unofficial title of the "Greatest NFL Team of All-Time." <ref name="Greatest NFL Teams of All Time">[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/football/teams/greatest.html Greatest NFL Teams of All Time]</ref> The NFL Network "America's Game" rated the 1985 Bears as the second best Super Bowl champions ever.

Buddy Ryan left in 1986 to become the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.  When asked if he was happy Ryan was gone, Ditka replied he was not happy but "elated." In 1986, 1987 and 1988, the Bears won the Central Division title and finished each year with either the best or second best record in the NFC. However, all three teams lost in the playoffs at home. Ditka suffered a heart attack during the 1988 season and was expected to miss much of the season, but was on the sidelines as an "advisor" the next week and back in full charge the week after.

The Bears started 4&ndash;0 in 1989, but a series of last-second losses eventually led to a complete meltdown at the end of the season as the Bears finished 6&ndash;10.  The Bears rallied to win a weak Central Division in 1990 and make the playoffs as a wild card in 1991, but were eliminated convincingly in the early rounds.  After dropping to 5&ndash;11 in the [[1992 NFL season|1992]] season, the Bears fired Ditka.

He was awarded [[National Football League Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]] honors in [[1985 NFL season|1985]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988]] by the [[Associated Press]], [[The Sporting News]], and [[Pro Football Weekly]].

===New Orleans Saints===
In [[1997 NFL season|1997]], he returned to coach the [[New Orleans Saints]], which he refers to as the "three worst years" of his life. Ditka was roundly criticized for the trading of all of the team's [[1999 NFL Draft|1999]] draft picks (plus their first round draft pick in [[2000 NFL Draft|2000]]) to the [[Washington Redskins]] in order to move up in the draft and select Texas RB [[Ricky Williams]] (Washington would later use the picks to select future Pro Bowlers [[Champ Bailey]], [[Jon Jansen]] and [[LaVar Arrington]]). The trade was further mocked because of a magazine cover in which Ditka posed with Williams, who was wearing a wedding dress.<ref name=NOLA041809>Bill Baker, [http://blog.nola.com/saintsbeat/2009/04/wedding_photo_of_mike_ditka_an.html 'Wedding photo' of Mike Ditka and Ricky Williams was worth a thousand], April 18, 2009, Accessed May 11, 2010.</ref> Following the Saints dismal 3&ndash;13 season, Ditka along with general manager [[Bill Kuharich]] were fired. Despite the high expectations upon his hiring, Ditka's overall record with the Saints was 15&ndash;33. Over a total of 14 seasons as a head coach, Ditka amassed a regular season record of 121&ndash;95 and a postseason record of 6&ndash;6.

===Incidents===
Ditka was noted for making headlines regardless of what happened on the field. In [[1983 NFL season|1983]], he broke his wrist after punching a locker in an angry halftime tirade. In [[1985 NFL season|1985]], he was arrested and convicted of [[Driving while intoxicated|DWI]] after returning from a game with San Francisco.<ref name="dwi">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE6D7143AF936A25751C0A960948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fD%2fDitka%2c%20Mike Ditka's Defense Falters]</ref> In the midst of a very successful [[1988 NFL season|1988 season]], Ditka suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], but bounced back quickly. On another occasion in [[1987 NFL season|1987]], he threw an enormous piece of chewing gum at a [[San Francisco 49ers]] fan who had heckled and thrown a drink at him during a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night matchup]].<ref name=gum>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED81738F934A25751C1A961948260 Ditka Cuts Interviews]</ref> In 2007, a popular YouTube video<ref name=video>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkJ0dRxCX60 Da Coach and Da Media in Da 80s]</ref> showed 9 minutes worth of "highlights" from Ditka's various press conferences during the late 1980s as he jousted with reporters and (on occasions) passing fans; included were rants in which he shouted to one heckler, "See that, that's your IQ buddy - ZERO!" and one instance when a reporter noted that Ditka seemed upset. A visibly furious Ditka responded without making eye contact, "I've never been upset in my life."

==Broadcasting career==
After his dismissal from the Bears in [[1992 NFL season|1992]], Ditka took a broadcasting job with [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], working as an analyst on ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#NFL Live|NFL Live]]'' and as a color commentator for many other NBC broadcasts. From the [[2000 NFL season|2000]] to the [[2001 NFL season|2001]] season he was a studio analyst on ''[[The NFL Today]]'' on [[CBS Sports]]. He is currently a commentator on [[ESPN]]'s ''NFL Live'', ESPN's ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'', and [[CBS Radio]]-[[Westwood One]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' pregame show. On his radio show, Coach Ditka is called "America's Coach" by well known sidekick [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]]. Beginning in 2006 Ditka appeared on a Seattle radio program; "Groz with Gas" on 950 [[KJR-AM]] Seattle, on Thursday afternoons with Dave Grosby and Mike Gastineau. Ditka regularly appears on Chicago radio station ESPN 1000 ([[WMVP]]-AM), often broadcasting on Thursday mornings from one of his [[eponymous]] restaurants along with ESPN 1000 mid-morning hosts Marc Silverman and [[Tom Waddle]], a former Bears player under Ditka.

Ditka served as color commentator for [[ESPN]]'s September 10, 2007 broadcast of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', alongside [[Mike Greenberg]] and [[Mike Golic]].[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/mccarthy/2007-06-19-mccarthy-espn_N.htm] He replicated this role on the second game of the doubleheader in 2008 as well.

==Other ventures==
In 1991, Ditka cooperated with [[Accolade (game company)|Accolade]] to produce the computer game ''[[Mike Ditka's Ultimate Football]]''.

In 1995, Ditka starred as a football coach in a [[full motion video]] game called "[[Quarterback Attack]]", released for the [[Sega Saturn]], PC, and [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]].

Ditka performed "[[Take Me Out to the Ballgame]]" during a [[Chicago Cubs]] game at [[Wrigley Field]] in 1998, the first season after the passing of [[Harry Caray]]. ''Chicago Now'' blogger Marcus Leshock derided the performance, dubbing Ditka "the worst 7th-inning singer in history."<ref>[http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/leshock-value/2010/04/the-7-worst-7th-inning-stretch-performances-in-history.html The 7 WORST 7th Inning Stretch Performances In History]</ref>

Ditka was inducted to the [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

Ditka has also done guest spots and cameos on shows from ''[[L.A. Law]]'' to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. In [[2005 in film|2005]], Mike Ditka portrayed himself in the comedy ''[[Kicking & Screaming]]'' as a little league soccer coach, alongside [[Will Ferrell]].

Ditka was also one of the owners of the [[Chicago Rush]], an [[Arena Football League (1987<U+2013>2008)|Arena Football Team]]. After the Rush's victory at [[ArenaBowl XX]], Ditka could be seen celebrating on the field.

In January 2007, Ditka used the Super Bowl return of the Chicago Bears as a platform to promote efforts by many early NFL players trying to raise money to former NFL players in need of money and medical assistance. Angry at the wealthy NFL ignoring the players that helped to create the league, Ditka and other former players have since been attempting to raise money, in the words of Hall of Famer [[Joe DeLamielleure]], "for guys who made this league and built it on their backs, their knees, their legs and now they're all broken down and they can't even get a decent pension."<ref>[http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/sports_seasonticket/2007/02/retired_nfl_pla_1.html Retired NFL Players]</ref> Ultimately, however, in December 2007, Ditka folded his "Hall of Fame Assistance Trust Fund" charity amidst revelations that, "in 2005 the group gave out more money to pay celebrities to play golf than the group in its entire three years of operation gave out to injured players," according to Laurie Styron of the American Institute of Philanthropy.<ref>[http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/topstories/news-article.aspx?storyid=97946&ref=rss Charity Run By NFL Legend Mike Ditka Folds]</ref>

Fund raising and charitable good works have also led Ditka to partner with Immediate Legacy creator Dennis Tubbergen of USA Wealth Management, to help American charities find increased donor support in sagging economic times.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the spring of 2007 Ditka worked alongside X Management and Geneva Hospitality to form Mike Ditka Resorts [http://www.mikeditkaresorts.com/], currently consisting of two resorts in the [[Orlando, Florida]] area.

Mike Ditka owns a chain of restaurants, '''Ditka's''', which has two locations in Illinois and one in Pennsylvania.
During [[Super Bowl XLIV]], Ditka (who was not in the original) joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting the [[Super Bowl Shuffle]] in a [[Boost Mobile]] commercial.<ref>http://www.unwronged.com/#/mainstage/</ref>

==Politics==
In July 2004, Ditka, a self-described "extremely mega-super-ultra conservative",<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/wickham/2004-07-19-wickham_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=GOP's morality drive hits potholes | date=July 19, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> was reportedly considering running against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] for an open seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] for [[Illinois]] in the [[U.S. Senate elections, 2004|2004 Senate election]].  The seat was being vacated by [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and Republican nominee [[Jack Ryan (Senate candidate)|Jack Ryan]] withdrew from the race amid controversy at the end of June, leaving the Republicans in a bind. Local and national political leaders, from Illinois Republican Party Chair [[Judy Baar Topinka]] to National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair [[George Felix Allen|Sen. George Allen]], whose [[George Allen (football)|father by the same name]] was an assistant coach with the Bears in the 1960s when Ditka played, met with Ditka in an effort to persuade him to fill the spot on the ticket.

On July 14, however, Ditka announced he would not seek the nomination, citing personal and business considerations (his wife was against the run and he operates a chain of restaurants).<ref name=norun>[http://www.local6.com/news/3532156/detail.html Ditka: 'Second Thoughts Until The Day I Die' - Orlando News Story - WKMG Orlando<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Barack Obama went on to defeat former ambassador [[Alan Keyes]] in a landslide in the November 2004 election. In October 2008, Ditka introduced vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] at a rally in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]].

In stark contrast to the above-stated positions, Ditka appeared in an ad during the [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 Illinois gubernatorial election]] for incumbent Democrat [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]].  In the ad, Ditka states that, "[D]oing the right thing for the people who put you in office is more important than what you can do for yourself in office . . . and I think he'll do that.  I think he understands that . . . and I think he's good people."  Quinn, at the time, was locked into a tight race against State Senator [[Bill Brady (politician)|Bill Brady]] a conservative Republican from [[Bloomington, Illinois|Bloomington]].  Quinn would go on to narrowly defeat Brady.
