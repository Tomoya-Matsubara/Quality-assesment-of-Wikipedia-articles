'''[[List of Magnapop band members|List of members]]'''
}}
'''Magnapop''' is an [[alternative rock]] band based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Formed in 1989, the band has consistently included songwriting duo [[Linda Hopper]] as vocalist and [[Ruthie Morris]] on guitar. The band first achieved recognition in the [[Benelux]] countries of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg through the festival circuit and have remained popular in Europe throughout their career. After modest success in the United States in the mid-1990s with the singles "[[Slowly, Slowly]]" and "[[Open the Door (Magnapop song)|Open the Door]]" and a series of albums produced by [[Michael Stipe]], [[Bob Mould]], and [[Geza X]], the band went on an extended hiatus due to the dissolution of their record label. They returned with a new rhythm section in 2005 on the [[Daemon Records]] release ''[[Mouthfeel (album)|Mouthfeel]]''. The band has continued to perform and record since this reunion and have self-released two more albums. Magnapop's musical style is noted for blending the pop vocals and melodies of Hopper with the aggressive, punk-influenced guitar-playing of Morris and her back-up vocal harmonies.

==History==
===Formation and self-titled debut (1989<U+2013>1993)===

After the group folded, Lynda Stipe and Hopper formed [[Oh-OK]], whose line-up later included [[Matthew Sweet]] and David McNair.<ref name="spin">{{Citation |last=Powers |first=Ann |publication-date=October 1996 |title=Magna 'Tude: Magnapop proves that spirited pop can pack a serious punch |periodical=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=12 |issue=7 |issn=0886-3032 |publisher=SPIN Media LLC}}</ref> That project ended in 1984 and Hopper briefly belonged to a band named Holiday, who released their only EP in 1987.<ref name="psf" />

In 1989, Ruthie Morris had recently moved to Atlanta from [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]<ref name="vox">{{Citation |last=Verrico |first=Lisa |publication-date=April 1994 |title=Magnapop |periodical=[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]}}</ref><U+2014>where she played a few shows as the guitarist for The Pockets. Hopper and Morris were introduced by a mutual acquaintance and became fast friends; they began songwriting when they first met.<ref name="psf" /> The duo had a difficult time finding collaborators to form a complete band (as Hopper described it, "We had to beg people to come and play with us.")<ref name="melodymaker">{{Citation |last=Arundel |first=Jim |publication-date=1994-01-29 |title=Bob Makes It Big |periodical=[[Melody Maker]]}}</ref> The duo eventually recruited bassist Tim Lee and McNair on drums in March 1990.<ref name="raygun">{{Citation |last=Blackwell |first=Mark |publication-date=October 1994 |title=Magnapop |periodical=[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Ray Gun]]}}</ref> Lee left the band after a brief tenure and was replaced by Shannon Mulvaney, whom Morris met at a record store. The musicians named themselves Homemade Sister after a line from the film ''[[Baby Doll]]'' and released their first single<U+2014>"Rip the Wreck"/"[[Merry (song)|Merry]]"<U+2014>on Safety Net Records in 1990. Displeased with their name, the band was briefly renamed Swell,<ref name="crawled" /> before they found out [[Swell (band)|a San Francisco band]] had the same name and then billed themselves as Swell Dopa.

The band proceeded to pass the tape to a promoter in The Netherlands who gave the band some club dates as well as a spot at the side stage of the 1991 [[Rotterdam Festival]]. After the positive response they received, they were promoted to the main stage the next day.<ref name="melodymaker" /> In The Netherlands, Magnapop was signed to [[PIAS Recordings|Play It Again Sam Records]], who released the ''[[Sugarland (EP)|Sugarland]]'' EP and ''[[Magnapop (album)|Magnapop]]'' [[demo album]] in 1992. Their self-titled first album included four of the 1990 Stipe demos, and was released on [[Caroline Records]] in the United States. A [[music video]] for the single "[[Merry (song)|Merry]]" was shot and aired in Europe.

Magnapop was featured on a variety of various artist compilations. Their first commercial recording other than their independent single was their 1992 [[cover version]] of "[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]" for ''Here No Evil&nbsp;<U+2013> A Tribute to [[The Monkees]]''. The band was also featured on other various artist [[tribute albums]], including "Ear" (a different recording from the one on ''Magnapop'') for ''Delicacy & Nourishment&nbsp;<U+2013> Lyrics by [[Ernest Noyes Brookings]] Vol. 3'' in 1992 and 1993's recording of "[[Every Grain of Sand]]" for ''Outlaws Blues Volume Two&nbsp;<U+2013> A Tribute to [[Bob Dylan]]'' with [[violin]]ist Mamie Fike. The band also recorded the ''[[Kiss My Mouth]]'' EP with [[Ted Niceley]] and released it in Europe. Around this time, the band was so fraught from booking recording sessions, that they briefly considered breaking up.<ref name="rollingstone">{{Citation |last=Hendrickson |first=Matt |publication-date=1994-12-01 |title=Magnapop: Georgia's Finest? |periodical=[[Rolling Stone]] |publication-place=[[New York City]], [[New York]], [[United States]] |publisher=Rolling Stone, LLC |issue=696}}</ref>

===Mainstream success (1994<U+2013>1997)===

[[Bob Mould]] of [[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]] had seen the band at a show in [[New York City]]'s [[CBGB]] as well as in Rotterdam<U+2014>he called the latter show their "turning point"<U+2014>and invited the band to tour with his new group,<ref name="melodymaker" /> [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]], in Europe and the United States in 1992<U+2013>1993. The band asked Sugar bassist and fellow Athens musician [[David Barbe]] produce their major label debut album. When he refused, Mould offered to record with the band, taking them to Pedernales Recording Studio, in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] in August 1993. The sessions would result in the album ''[[Hot Boxing]]'', which was released by Play It Again Sam in Europe and [[Priority Records]] domestically on July 5, 1994. Releasing an album by Magnapop was a radical departure for Priority who had previously focused on [[Rap music|rap]] music.<ref name="priority">{{Citation |last=Morris |first=Chris |publication-date=1994-07-30 |title=Declaration of Independents: Priority Goes Magnapop; BOC Remade |periodical=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publication-place=United States |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |volume=106 |issue=31 |page=49 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

The album produced two singles: "[[Slowly, Slowly]]", which spent seven weeks on the charts,<ref name="charts">{{citation |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |title=Rock Tracks |format=paperback |date=January 1, 1996 |publisher=[[Record Research Inc.]] |isbn=0898201144 |page=204}}</ref> peaking on September 10, 1994, at 25 on the U.S. [[Modern Rock Tracks]],<ref name="Allmusic charts" /> and "[[Lay It Down (Magnapop song)|Lay It Down]]", which topped the 1993 [[De Afrekening]] poll. The band toured the United States supporting [[The Lemonheads]] in 1993 and played at the [[Phoenix Festival#1994|1994]] [[Phoenix Festival]] and [[Marktrock]] to promote the album and created music videos for "Lay It Down", "Slowly, Slowly", and "Texas". The promotional EP ''[[Big Bright Cherry]]'' was released in 1994 and included three tracks from the ''Hot Boxing'' recording sessions as well as three self-produced songs.

In 1995, the McNair and the band parted ways, with neither party giving a definitive rationale. Hopper explained "We had a hard time recording ''Hot Boxing'', because our drummer had a lot of things in the way... Nobody wants to hurt anyone, or to cut them out, but it was just like four adults getting a divorce, and their child is the band."<ref name="huh">{{Citation |last=Alden |first=Grant |date=June 1996 |title=Magna Come Loudly |periodical=[[huH]]}}</ref> She has alternately explained that the split was due to the "alternative lifestyles" of McNair and the rest of the group.<ref name="phoenix">{{Citation |last=Taylor |first=Charles |publication-date=1996-06-06/13 |title=Risky Business: Georgia's Magnapop Make Party Music with a Difference |periodical=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston Phoenix]] |publication-place=[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]] |publisher=[[Phoenix Media/Communications Group]] |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/music/reviews/06-06-96/MAGNAPOP.html |accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref> The remaining trio recruited [[session musician|session]] drummer [[Josh Freese]] and [[Audio engineering|engineers]] Sandy Solomon and Bernie Zwass to record a cover of [[Tom Waits]]' "Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis" at Plus Four Recordings Studios, in [[Sherman Oaks, California|Sherman Oaks]], [[California]] in June 1995 for the compilation album ''[[Step Right Up: The Songs of Tom Waits]]''. Freese joined the group in November<U+2013>December of that year in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to record ''[[Rubbing Doesn't Help]]''. Mould was unavailable, so the band relocated to Los Angeles<ref name="huh" /> and worked with producer [[Geza X]] at his home studio<ref name="ap">{{Citation |last=Micallef |first=Ken |publication-date=August 1996 |title=Magnapop Rub You the Right Way |periodical=[[Alternative Press]]}}</ref> in attempt to make a more "eclectic" album that would represent the diversity of their songwriting.<ref name="school">{{Citation |last=Kenneally |first=Tim |publication-date=December 1996 |title=Future Shockers: Rhythmic Waves |periodical=[[Guitar School Magazine]]}}</ref> The album produced the singles "[[Open the Door (Magnapop song)|Open the Door]]" and "[[This Family]]" (the former also had a music video), as well as the EP ''[[Fire All Your Guns at Once]]''.

Los Angeles musician Mark Posgay auditioned for the band in 1995 and became the group's permanent drummer.<ref name="pollstar" /> In July of that year, Magnapop supported [[R.E.M.]] on their ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' World Tour and continued playing in the United States and Europe, including an appearance at [[X-Fest]] in [[X-Fest#Dayton, Ohio|1996]].

Boston native and former [[The Queers|Queers]] bassist Greg Urbaitis replaced him after replying to an ad in ''[[The Recycler]]'' and the band continued to play live shows through 1997, including supporting [[Throwing Muses]] on their farewell tour. Posgay quit that summer and he was replaced by former Lifter drummer Johnny Rozas and this line-up recorded six demos at a recording studio in Orange County. This version of the band was short-lived as Magnapop was informed while on tour that their record label's rock division ceased to exist<ref name="cmj">{{Citation |publication-date=December 1996 |title=Letters |periodical=[[College Music Journal]] |publication-place=United States |publisher=CMJ Network, Inc. |issue=40 |page=4 |issn=1074-6978}}</ref> and they did not have any funding for future touring or recording.<ref name="psf" /> Compounding matters further, the band members were still under contract to their old record label and were legally disbarred from using the name "Magnapop" until their contract expired seven years later.<ref name="punkglobe">{{Citation |last=Cokyuce |first=Ozgur |publication-date=December 2008 |title=Magnapop/Ruthie Morris |publisher=[[Punk Globe]] |url=http://punkglobe.com/magnapopInterview1208.html |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>

Hopper and Morris continued to play a few acoustic live shows as a duo into 1999, occasionally with accompaniment (such as Philadelphia bassist Billy Warburton and drummer Lance Crow)<ref name="citypaper">{{Citation |url=http://wwwsss.citypaper.net/articles/092498/pick.magna.shtml |title=Magnapop |publisher=''[[Philadelphia City Paper]]'' |last=Rapa |first=Patrick |date=1998-09-24/10-01 |accessdate=2009-06-24}}</ref> and attempted to record an EP for record label Vital Cog with a [[drum machine]] as backing,<ref name="citypaper" /> but ended up putting Magnapop on an indefinite hiatus. During this time, Morris also moved to Seattle, where she recorded a 2002 single with drummer Curtis Hall as [[New Candidates (band)|The New Candidates]]. Hopper, Morris, and a group of Seattle musicians also demoed some Hopper/Morris songs during this period.<ref name="punkglobe" /> Hall would also drum with Hopper, Morris, and Mulvaney for a few Magnapop shows in 2002<U+2013>2003. The band officially re-formed in 2003 with bassist Scott Rowe and drummer Brian Fletcher to tour the European festival circuit and record an album. In The Netherlands, Hopper also performed vocals on [[R.E.M.]]'s cover of "Favorite Writer" at two of the group's concerts on June 21 and 22.<ref name="favorite">{{Citation |url=http://www.remhq.com/photo_gallery_detail.php?id=1259&gallery_id=118 |title=Michael and Linda Hopper finish singing "Favourite Writer" by Magnapop |publisher=[[R.E.M.|R.E.M.HQ]] |date=2003-06-22 |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref>

The following May, the band to entered Zero Return Studios in Atlanta with drummer Curt Wells as producer for their first album in almost a decade. On January 25, 2005, Magnapop released ''[[Mouthfeel (album)|Mouthfeel]]'' on [[Amy Ray]]'s record label [[Daemon Records]] and supported it with a tour through the United States. By 2005, Fletcher had left the group, and drummer Chad Williams had been recruited to replace him on the ''Mouthfeel'' tour that included an appearance at [[South by Southwest]].<ref name="popmatters">{{Citation |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/m/magnapop-050312.shtml |title=12 March 2005: Velvet Lounge&nbsp;<U+2014> Washington, DC |last=Brecheisen |first=Dave |publisher=[[Pop Matters]] |date=2005-03-29 |accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref> One of these performances was recorded for the band's first [[live album]]<U+2014>''[[Magnapop Live at Maxwell's 03/09/2005]]''<U+2014>which they released independently through online music distributors including [[eMusic]], the [[iTunes Store]], and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]. In May 2006, the band completed a tour of Belgium and The Netherlands and returned to Atlanta to begin work on the followup to ''Mouthfeel''. They continued touring Europe in 2007 and completed writing and recording for a new album sometime prior to 2008, with the album initially slated to be released in summer 2009.<ref name="punkglobe" /> These sessions recorded with [[Brian Paulson]] were released as ''[[Chase Park]]'' on September 4, 2009, through digital distributors by the band's own, newly created label, The Kraft Records.
