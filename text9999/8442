==Nomination campaign==
Following the general election in [[Irish general election, 2011|February 2011]], and the election of the [[members of the 24th Seanad]], only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of Oireachtas to nominate a candidate: [[Fine Gael]] (76 [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la|TDs]] and 19  senators), the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] (37 TDs and 13 senators) and [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]] (19 TDs and 14 senators). [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], the next largest party in the [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]], have 14 TDs and 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (of which there are currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.

For the first time in any presidential election, Fianna F<U+00E1>il is neither running a candidate nor supporting the nomination of a candidate.
