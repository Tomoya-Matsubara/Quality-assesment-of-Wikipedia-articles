'''Mar<U+00ED>a del Luj<U+00E1>n Telpuk''', (sometimes '''Mar<U+00ED>a de Luj<U+00E1>n Telpuk''') or the '''Suitcase Girl''' is a former airport policewoman at [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] who noticed a suitcase with [[US$]]800,000 as it went through an [[X-ray machine]] in August 2007.<ref name=SGF8GSB>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB119984618762676979.html|title='Suitcase Girl' Finds 800 Grand; Stardom Beckons|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=[[2008-01-09]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company, Inc.]]|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|author=Moffett, Matt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23616690/displaymode/1176/|title=Related Photos|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=[[2008-03-18]]|publisher=[[MSNBC.com]]}}</ref> In December 2007, the money became a very public part of an international election suitcase scandal, known as ''[[Maletinazo]]''. When the suitcase scandal became public, she became an international celebrity and appeared on covers several magazines, including those of the February 2008 issue of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and the March 2008 issue of the [[Venezuela]]n edition of ''Playboy'' magazine.<ref name=APMCS>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1722328,00.html|title=A Playboy Model's Cinderella Story|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=[[2008-03-13]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time Magazine]]|author=Goni, Uki}}</ref>

==Maletinazo==
On [[August 4]] [[2007]] at 2:45&nbsp;a.m.,<ref name=VVW$RUAR>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=a73rBCz3iDho&refer=latin_america|title=Venezuelan Valise With $790,550 Roils U.S.-Argentina Relations|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=[[2008-01-07]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|work=[[Bloomberg.com]]|author=Voreacos, David, Eliana Raszewski and Bill Faries}}</ref> she discovered the money that became part of a political scandal in the electoral campaign of [[President of Argentina]] [[Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Kirchner]] and that was possessed by a {{city-state|Key Biscayne|Florida}} associate of [[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]].<ref name=Sgch15m/><ref name=APMCS/> The carrier, Guido Antonini Wilson (who is referred to in the press by both Antonini and Wilson and who is sometimes referred to by the nicknames "El Gordo" or "The Fat Man"),<ref name=Apcc>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6946348.stm|title=Argentina probes cash-filled case|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=BBC News|author=Schweimler, Daniel}}</ref> is an [[interpreter]] and was part of a delegation of executives that traveled to Argentina in advance of Ch<U+00E1>vez' energy deal signing.<ref name=Apcc/> He opened the bag at the insistence of Telpuk, who noticed the six dense and perfectly rectangular blocks in the luggage scans.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> At first, Wilson had explained the items as books and papers at first.<ref name=VVW$RUAR/><ref name=Sgch15m/> When forced to open it, he began to stammer and show signs of nervousness,<ref name=Sgch15m/> and he said the suitcase only contained about $60,000.<ref name=VVW$RUAR/> The blocks turned out to be US$790,550.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> The delegation, which arrived on a [[Cessna Citation]] jet arriving from [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] chartered by [[Enarsa|Energ<U+00ED>a Argentina, SA]], carried five Venezuelans and three Argentines who represented their respective governments' energy companies.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> In a country known for its corruption, Telpuk did not have an interest in a [[bribe]] although she felt Wilson may have expected her to be willing to take one. Instead of pursuing a bribe, she reported the finding.<ref name=APMCS/>

Although the local media of both Argentina and Venezuela gave the story immediate front page coverage, the case faded away until after Kirchner was elected.<ref name=VVW$RUAR/><ref name=Sgch15m/> The United States prosecutors believe that the money represented a contribution from Venezuelan President Ch<U+00E1>vez to the presidential campaign of Argentina's [[leftist]] leader, Kirchner.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> Two days after the [[December 10]] [[2007]] inauguration, several arrests were announced by [[prosecutor]]s working for the [[United States Attorney General]]. The arrests were for activities related to having offered Wilson $2 million to keep quiet about the contributions from Venezuela to support Kirchner's campaign.<ref name=SGF8GSB/><ref name=VVW$RUAR/>

For her part, Telpuk felt she was caught in the "middle of a rivalry of nations".<ref name=Sgch15m/> She has been vilified as a [[mercenary]] fortune-seeker and [[CIA]] lackey.<ref name=Sgch15m/> She has received a variety of threats by telephone and [[email]], and had police protection starting when the incident became a public scandal in December.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> She has even received a [[bouquet]] with an ominous note.<ref name=APMCS/>

==Media appearances==
Her first magazine cover appearance was on the December issue of an irreverent political magazine, ''Veintitr<U+00E9>s'' where Telpuk appeared under the headline "The Bombshell Behind the Suitcase" standing behind a suitcase. She wore little other than a police cap, and another headline on the cover read, "Is She the Key Piece of a Plot Designed by Washington?"<ref name=SGF8GSB/> She then appeared on the February issue of the Argentine edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine next to the headline "Corrupci<U+00F3>n Al Desnudo" (translated as "Corruption Laid Bare").<ref name=APMCS/> Subsequently, she appeared on the March 2008 issue of the Venezuelan edition of ''Playboy'' magazine. She posed with a red suitcase decorated with both the [[Flag of Argentina|Argentine]] and [[Flag of Venezuela|Venezuelan flags]] while wearing a scarf, black leather gloves and black-and-white boots for her ''Playboy'' cover appearance. Within the magazine in her [[pictorial]], she posed with fewer clothes and with various props: ubiquitous suitcase, [[dollar bill]]s, including the [[propeller]] blades of a single-engine airplane.<ref name=Sgch15m/> She decided to pursue an appearance on the Argentine variety show ''Skating for a Dream'', after [[Marcelo Tinelli]] visited her at the airport to congratulate her.<ref name=SGF8GSB/> She may become a television show host.<ref name=SGF8GSB/>
