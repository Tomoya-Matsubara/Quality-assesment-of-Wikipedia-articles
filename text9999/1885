'''North Curl Curl''' is a [[suburb]] in northern [[Sydney]], in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. North Curl Curl is located 19 kilometres north-east of the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[Local Government Areas in Australia|local government area]] of [[Warringah Council]] and is part of the [[Northern Beaches]] region.  

==History==
[[Image:BeachSuburbs0013.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Rock carving at North Curl Curl Beach]]
Curl Curl may be derived from the [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] phrase ''curial curial'', meaning ''river of life''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name_search/extract?id=JPYbBKsySX |title=Geographical names register extract: Curl Curl |publisher=[[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales]] |accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> 

The name Curl Curl Lagoon was originally applied to Manly Lagoon, which empties into the ocean at [[Queenscliff, New South Wales|Queenscliff]], and the current Curl Curl Lagoon was named Harbord Lagoon. This was a result of the land grant of 'Harbord' originally being much larger than [[Freshwater, New South Wales|the suburb that later bore this name]]. The names were changed as a part of a renaming program in the 1980s to reflect the true location of the lagoons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manlydaily.com.au/article/2007/12/08/7740_news_feature.html |title=Manly Daily article |publisher=[[Cumberland newspapers]] |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>.

==Geography==
[[Image:NorthCurlyBeach.jpg|thumb|North Curl Curl Beach at sunset]]
Curl Curl Lagoon and Greendale Creek separate North Curl Curl from [[Curl Curl, New South Wales|Curl Curl]] in the south. To the west the border with [[Brookvale, New South Wales|Brookvale]] runs along Harbord Road. [[Wingala, New South Wales|Wingala]] is an 'urban place' as classified by the [[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales|Geographical Names Board]] in the north and western parts of the suburb, lying on the southern slopes of a hill that overlaps into [[Dee Why, New South Wales|Dee Why]]. Headland Road marks the northern boundary, while the [[Tasman Sea]] lies to the east.

North Curl Curl Beach sits on the south-eastern border, south of Dee Why Head and lying under its cliffs, and is divided from [[Curl Curl Beach]] by the mouth of the lagoon. The suburb is generally characterised by the sometimes steep southern slopes of Wingala Hill and Dee Why Head to the north, which flatten out into the former floodplain of the lagoon towards the south.

==Sport and recreation==
The North Curl Curl Surf Life Saving Club patrol North Curl Curl Beach. North Curl Curl Knights are the local [[rugby league]] side, with the colours of green and gold.

Sport and recreation facilities exist in the extensive parks and playing fields areas to the north of the Lagoon, including the Bowling Club (formerly the Curl Curl Women's Bowling Club but now run by Dee Why RSL Club), Curl Curl Youth Club, soccer fields, baseball fields, cricket pitches, netball courts, as well as rugby league and rugby union fields.

Surfing is a big part of the area, and many local competitions take place here, such as CUBA, Curl Curl Longboarders and others.

==Schools==
