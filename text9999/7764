The '''Lowenstein-Jensen medium''', more commonly known as '''LJ medium''', is a [[growth medium]]<ref name="pmid18256436">{{cite journal |author=Elbir H, Abdel-Muhsin AM, Babiker A |title=A one-step DNA PCR-based method for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex grown on Lowenstein-Jensen media |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=316<U+2013>7 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18256436 |doi= |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18256436}}</ref> specially used for culture of '''[[Mycobacterium]]''', notably ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.

When grown on LJ medium, ''M. tuberculosis'' appears as brown, granular colonies (sometimes called "buff, rough and tough"). The media must be incubated for a significant length of time, usually four weeks, due to the slow doubling time of ''M. tuberculosis'' compared with other bacteria (15-20 hours).

== Composition ==

The usual composition<ref>[http://www.bd.com/ds/productCenter/220908.asp Composition of LJ medium]</ref> as applicable to ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' is:

* [[Malachite green]]
* [[Glycerol]]
* [[Asparagine]]
* [[Potato flour]]
* [[Coagulation|Coagulated]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]
* Mineral salt solution
** [[Potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]
** [[Magnesium sulfate]]
** [[Sodium citrate]]

The original formulation included starch, which was later found to be unnecessary and hence omitted.

Low levels of [[penicillin]] and [[nalidixic acid]] are also present in LJ medium to inhibit growth of [[gram positive bacteria|gram positive]] and [[gram negative bacteria]], in order to limit growth to Mycobacteria species only. Presence of malachite green in the medium inhibits most other bacteria. It is disinfected and solidified by a process of [[inspissation]]. Presence of glycerol enhances the growth of [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]].

If the slopes are made on test tubes they must be stored in cold and used within a month.

For cultivation of ''[[M.bovis]]'', glycerol is omitted and [[sodium pyruvate]] is added.

The medium appears green, opaque and opalescent.

==Uses==

* For diagnosis of Mycobacterial infections [[Image:TB Culture.jpg|thumb|Distinctive clusters of colorless ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]]]
* For testing antibiotic susceptibility of isolates
* For differentiating different species of mycobacterium (by colony morphology, growth rate, biochemical characteristics and microscopy)

==Alternative Culture media==

While the LJ medium is the most popular means of culturing Mycobacteria, as recommended by the International Union against Tuberculosis (IUAT), several alternative media have been investigated.<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qCqBAYajT1EC&lpg=PP7&ots=ielmD0b79I&dq=ananthanarayan%20panicker%20sixth%20edition&pg=PA352#v=onepage&q=&f=false Textbook of Microbiology by Ananthanarayan and Panicker, Sixth Edition]</ref>

===Solid media===

*Egg-based - Petragnini medium and Dorset medium
*Blood based -Tarshis medium
*Serum based - Loeffler medium
*Potato based - Pawlowsky medium

===Liquid media===

*Dubos' medium
*Middlebrook media
*Proskauer and Beck's medium
*Sula's medium
*Sauton's medium

===BACTEC===

The BACTEC system is a liquid medium with radiometric growth detection of Mycobacterium which has the advantage of more rapid detection as compared to traditional cultures. Antibiotic susceptibility testing can also be done.
