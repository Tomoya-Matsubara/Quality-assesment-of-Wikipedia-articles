The Durango was launched just after the second generation [[Dodge Dakota]] on which it was based. During the late 1980s, Chrysler designers had proposed building an SUV version of the Dakota pickup{{Fact|date=March 2008}}, but this was shelved when the [[Jeep]] division was about to release the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] as their flagship SUV. The Durango was marketed as a sturdy truck-based SUV designed to hold up to seven passengers and tow up to {{Auto lb|6700|0}}. The 4.7&nbsp;L [[Chrysler PowerTech engine#4.7|PowerTech]] [[V8]] replaced the 5.2&nbsp;L engine for 2000. In that same year a special [[all wheel drive]] performance version called the R/T was released with a 5.9&nbsp;L [[V8 engine]].

2001 saw a few revisions, including a redesigned interior, including a new dash, door panels, and revised seats. Other minor changes redesigned aluminium wheels, the removal of "Durango" badging from the doors, and minor changes to trim options.

===2004-2006===
The second generation Durango debuted shortly before the companion Dakota. Like the Dakota, it has much in common with the large [[Dodge Ram]] pickup, including a fully-boxed frame. And like the first generation model, its front grille resembles the Dakota's. It is {{Auto in|7|1}}. longer, {{Auto in|2|1}}. wider, and {{Auto in|3|1}}. taller than the previous model. For this model year, it offered a full third row with three seats, making the Durango an 8 Passenger SUV. The design has also has taken styling cues from the [[Dodge Powerbox]] concept as the design look similar except that the front fascia is more normal while the Powerbox had a different look. Chrysler introduced its own version of the Durango, the [[Chrysler Aspen]], for the 2007 model year. The Durango became nearly a full-size SUV this time <U+2014> although technically it is still classified as mid-size, and the upcoming [[Dodge Journey]] on the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] platform filled Dodge's mid-size SUV gap as a 2009 model.

===2007-present===
The 2007 model was reworked to halt a sales decline, debuting at the [[Dallas Auto Show]] in April 2006. It includes a reworked front clip with a new fascia, grille, hood, and headlamps as well as updated fenders and wheels. New features include [[electronic stability program]], [[tire pressure monitoring system]], [[rear park assist]], and a one-touch turn signal. The 2007 model also has a reworked floor, third-row seats, and electrical system in preparation for the 2009 [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] version.

===Hybrid=== <!--[[Dodge Durango Hybrid]] redirects here -->
A Dodge Durango Hybrid will be released in 2009<ref>www.dodge.com</ref>. It features the {{Convert|340|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{Auto L|5.7}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#5.7|Hemi]]'' engine with [[Multi-Displacement System|MDS]] as well as the new [[Two-Mode Hybrid]] system developed with [[General Motors]] and [[BMW]]. Reports indicate{{Who|date=March 2008}} a 25% gain in highway fuel economy and a 40% gain in the city{{Fact|date=February 2008}}. Testing on the Hybrid Durango with the Hemi [[V8]] engine{{Who|date=March 2008}} indicates fuel mileage to be about {{mpg|18.2}} (city) and {{mpg|22.5}} (highway) ([[EPA]] guidelines for 2008+ model year).

The normal (non-hybrid) Durango with the 5.7L Hemi goes {{mpg|13}} (city) and {{mpg|18}} (highway){{Fact|date=February 2008}}.

This is the second time that Dodge has announced a hybrid Durango. They made the first claim in 2000, for a slated release date of 2003, but it was never produced.

Chrysler announced that the 2009 Dodge Durango Hybrid would have a starting [[MSRP]] of $45,340. <ref>[http://www.autotropolis.com/cs/blogs/auto-news/archive/2008/06/17/Chrysler-prices-hybrid-SUVs-under-_2400_46_2C00_000.aspx www.autotropolis.com | Chrysler announces starting MSRP for 2009 Dodge Durango HEMI Hybrid<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
