'''Niagara Falls''' is a set of massive [[waterfall]]s located on the [[Niagara River]] in eastern  [[North America]], on the border between the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  Niagara Falls ({{lang-fr|les Chutes du Niagara}}) comprises three separate waterfalls:  the  [[Horseshoe Falls|Horseshoe Falls (Canadian Falls)]], the [[American Falls]], and the smaller, adjacent [[Bridal Veil Falls (Niagara Falls)|Bridal Veil Falls]]. The Falls are located 16 miles (26 km) away from the U.S. city of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and 43 miles (69 km) from the Canadian city of [[Toronto]]. The distance to downtown [[Toronto]] is 80 miles (123 km) when using roads.
 
The Falls formed after the receding of the glaciers of the most recent Ice Age, as water from the newly formed [[Great Lakes]] carved a path through the [[Niagara Escarpment]] enroute to the Atlantic Ocean. While not exceptionally high, Niagara Falls is very wide. With more than 6 million cubic feet (168,000&nbsp;[[cubic metre|m<U+00B3>]]) of water falling over the crestline every minute<ref name="Niagara Parks Trivia">{{cite web

Niagara Falls is not renowned only for its beauty.  The Falls are a valuable source of [[hydroelectric power]] for both Ontario and New York. Preserving this natural wonder from commercial overdevelopment, while allowing for the needs of the area's people, has been a challenging project for [[environmentalism|environmental preservationists]] since the nineteenth century. A popular tourist site for over a century, the Falls are shared between the [[twin cities]] of [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]] and [[Niagara Falls, New York]].

== Formation ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2007}}
The historical roots of Niagara Falls lie in the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], which ended some 10,000 years ago.  The North American [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] and the Niagara River are effects of this last continental [[ice age|ice sheet]], an enormous [[glacier]] that crept across the area from eastern [[Canada]]. The glacier drove through the area like a giant bulldozer, grinding up rocks and soil, moving them around, and deepening some river channels to make lakes. It dammed others with debris, forcing these rivers to make new channels. It is thought that there is an old valley, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present [[Welland Canal]].
[[Image:Canadian_Skyline4543.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A view of the Niagara Falls Canadian skyline]]
After the ice melted back, drainage from the upper Great Lakes became the present-day Niagara River, which could not follow the old filled valley, so it found the lowest outlet on the rearranged topography. In time the river cut a gorge across the [[Niagara Escarpment]], the north facing [[cliff]] or [[cuesta]] formed by erosion of the southwardly dipping (tilted) and resistant Lockport formation between [[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario]]. In doing so it exposed old marine [[rock (geology)|rock]]s that are much older than the geologically recent glaciation. Three major formations are exposed in the gorge that was cut by the Niagara River.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Image:Ilievaart-falls0805 7584smaller.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A view of [[Skylon Tower]] from USA side]]

When the newly established river encountered the erosion-resistant Lockport [[dolomite|dolostone]], the hard layer eroded much more slowly than the underlying softer rocks. The aerial photo clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle [[Silurian]]), which underlies the rapids above the falls and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall. It is composed of very dense, hard and very strong [[limestone]] and dolostone.

Immediately below, comprising about two thirds of the cliff is the weaker, softer, and more crumbly and sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian). It is mainly [[shale]], though it has some thin limestone layers, and contains large quantities of [[fossil]]s. Because it erodes more easily, the river has undercut the hard cap rock and created the falls.

Submerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the Queenston Formation (Upper [[Ordovician]]), which is composed of shales and fine [[sandstone]]s. All three formations were laid down in an ancient [[sea]], and their differences of character derive from changing conditions within that sea.

[[Image:niagara_falls.jpg|thumb|200px|Niagara Falls from space, April 2001]]
The original Niagara Falls were near the sites of present-day [[Queenston, Ontario, Canada]], and  [[Lewiston, New York]], but [[erosion]] of their crest has caused the waterfalls to retreat several kilometres southward. Just upstream from the Falls' current location, [[Goat Island (New York)|Goat Island]] splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east. Although erosion and recession have been slowed in this century by engineering, the falls will eventually recede far enough to drain most of [[Lake Erie]], the bottom of which is higher than the bottom of the falls. Engineers are working to reduce the rate of erosion to retard this event as long as possible.

The Canadian Horseshoe Falls drop about 170 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (52&nbsp;m), although the American Falls have a clear drop of only 70 feet (21&nbsp;m) before reaching a jumble of fallen rocks which were deposited by a massive rock slide in 1954. The larger Canadian Horseshoe Falls are about 2,600 feet (792&nbsp;m) wide, while the American Falls are 1,060 feet (323&nbsp;m) wide. The volume of water approaching the Falls during peak flow season is 202,000 cubic feet per second (5,720&nbsp;m<U+00B3>/s).<ref name="History of Power">{{cite web

The 1958 flood of the Zambezi saw the falls reach record volumes of over 27,000,000 cubic feet (770,000&nbsp;[[cubic metre|m<U+00B3>]]) per minute (450,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft/13,000&nbsp;m<U+00B3> per second). Only [[Iguazu Falls]] between Brazil and Argentina rivals Victoria Falls in terms of size (with its record being only slightly less, at 26,550,000 cubic feet (750,000&nbsp;[[cubic metre|m<U+00B3>]]) per minute or 440,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft/12,500&nbsp;m<U+00B3> per second).</ref> During the summer months, when maximum  diversion of water for hydroelectric power occurs, 100,000&nbsp;[[Cubic foot|ft<U+00B3>]]/s (2,832&nbsp;m<U+00B3>/s) of water actually traverses the Falls, some 90% of which goes over the Horseshoe Falls. This volume is further halved at night, when most of the diversion to hydroelectric facilities occurs.

== Historical background ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2007}}
[[Image:Firmin Didot Freres Falls.PNG|thumb|left|150dpi|1837 woodcut of Niagara Falls, from ''Etats Unis d'Amerique'' by Roux de Rochelle.]]
The name "Niagara" is said to originate from an [[Iroquois]] word "Onguiaahra" meaning "The Strait." The region's original inhabitants were the ''Ongiara'', an Iroquois tribe named the ''[[Neutral Nation|Neutrals]]'' by French settlers, who found them helpful in mediating disputes with other tribes. 

Native American legend tells of Lelawala, a beautiful maid betrothed by her father to a brave she despised. Rather than marry, Lelawala chose to sacrifice herself to her true love He-No, the Thunder God, who dwelt in a cave behind the Horseshoe Falls. She paddled her canoe into the swift current of the Niagara River and was swept over the brink. He-No caught her as she plummeted, and together their spirits are said to live forever in the Thunder God's sanctuary behind the Falls.

[[Image:Scg.large.png|thumb|200px|The [[Niagara Movement]], a [[civil rights]] organization, first met here in 1905]]
Some controversy exists over which European first gave a written, eyewitness description of the Falls. The area was visited by French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] as early as 1604 during his exploration of Canada. Members of his party reported to him on the spectacular waterfalls, which he wrote of in his journals but may never have actually visited. Some credit Finnish-Swedish naturalist [[Pehr Kalm]] with the original firsthand description, penned during an expedition to the area early in the 18th century.  Most historians however agree that Belgian Father [[Louis Hennepin]] observed and described the Falls much earlier, in 1677, after travelling in the region with explorer [[Ren<U+00E9> Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle]], thus bringing them to the world's attention. Hennepin also first described the [[Saint Anthony Falls]] in [[Minnesota]]. His subsequently discredited claim that he also travelled the [[Mississippi River]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] cast some doubt on the validity of his writings and sketches of Niagara Falls. [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]] in Minnesota was named after Father Louis Hennepin. 

There is credible evidence, however, that Reverend [[Paul Ragueneau]] (1608<U+2013>1680) visited the falls prior to Hennepin's claim. Ragueneau was a French Jesuit who was working among the Huron First Nation in Canada. Born in Paris, Father Ragueneau entered the Society of Jesus about 1626 at the age of 18 and wrote more about his work than any other Jesuit in Canada. Ragueneau described the natural wonder in his writings some 35 years before Hennepin's visit.

During the 18th century tourism became popular, and it was the area's main industry by mid-century. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s brother [[Jerome Bonaparte|J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me]] visited with his bride in the early 19th century.<ref name="Canadacool">{{cite web

}}</ref>  Demand for passage over the Niagara River led in 1848 to the building of a footbridge and then Charles Ellet's ''Niagara Suspension Bridge''. This was supplanted by German-born [[John Augustus Roebling]]'s ''Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge'' in 1855. After the [[American Civil War]], the [[New York Central]] railroad publicized Niagara Falls as a focus of pleasure and honeymoon visits.  With increased railroad traffic, in 1886 Leffert Buck replaced Roebling's wood and stone bridge with the predominantly steel bridge that still carries trains over the Niagara River today. The first steel archway bridge near the Falls was completed in 1897. Known today as the [[Whirlpool Rapids Bridge]], it carries vehicles, trains, and pedestrians between Canada (through Canadian Customs Border Control) and the U.S. just below the Falls. In 1941 the ''Niagara Falls Bridge Commission'' completed the third current crossing in the immediate area of Niagara Falls with the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]], carrying both pedestrian and vehicular traffic between the two countries and Canadian and U.S. customs for each country.

Especially after the [[World War I|First World War]], tourism boomed again as automobiles made getting to the Falls much easier. The story of Niagara Falls in the 20th century is largely that of efforts to harness the energy of the Falls for [[hydroelectric power]] and to control the rampant development on both the American and Canadian sides which threatened the area's natural beauty.

== Impact on industry and commerce ==
{{unreferenced|section|date= January 2007}}
[[Image:NiagaraFallsUS.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[American Falls]] (large waterfall on the left) and [[Bridal Veil Falls]] (smaller waterfall on the right)]]

The enormous energy of the Falls was long recognized as a potential source of power. The first known effort to harness the waters was in 1759, when Daniel Joncairs built a small canal above the Falls to power his sawmill. Augustus and Peter Porter purchased this area and all of American Falls in 1805 from the New York state government, and enlarged the original canal to provide hydraulic power for their gristmill and tannery. In 1853, the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Mining Company was chartered, which eventually constructed the canals which would be used to generate electricity. In 1881, under the leadership of Jacob Schoellkopf, enough power was produced to send [[direct current]] to illuminate both the Falls themselves and nearby Niagara Falls village.

When [[Nikola Tesla]], for whom a memorial was later built at Niagara Falls, NY (USA), invented the [[three-phase]] system of [[alternating current]] power transmission, distant transfer of electricity became possible. In 1883, the Niagara Falls Power Company, a descendant of Schoellkopf's firm, hired [[George Westinghouse]] to design a system to generate alternating current. By 1896, with financing from moguls like [[J.P. Morgan]], [[John Jacob Astor IV]], and the [[Vanderbilt]]s, they had constructed giant underground conduits leading to turbines generating upwards of 100,000 [[horsepower]] (75 MW), and were sending power as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], twenty [[mile]]s (32&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) away. Private companies on the Canadian side also began to harness the energy of the Falls. The Government of the province of [[Ontario]], Canada eventually brought power transmission operations under public control in 1906, distributing Niagara's energy to various parts of the Canadian province. Currently between 50% and 75% of the Niagara River's flow is diverted via four huge tunnels that arise far upstream from the waterfalls. The water then passes through [[hydroelectric]] turbines that supply power to nearby areas of the Canada and the USA before returning to the river well past the Falls.

[[Image:Niagara1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Both American and Horseshoe Falls seen from Canada in a [[panoramic]] view.]]
The most powerful hydroelectric stations on the Niagara River are Sir [[Adam Beck]] 1 and 2 on the Canadian side, and the [[Robert Moses]] Niagara Power Plant and the Lewiston Pump Generating Plant on the American side. All together, Niagara's generating stations can produce about 4.4 [[gigawatt|GW]] of power.

In August 2005, [[Ontario Power Generation]], which is now responsible for the Sir Adam Beck stations, announced plans to build a new 10.4&nbsp;km (6<U+00BD> mile) tunnel to tap water from farther up the Niagara river than is possible with the existing arrangement. The project is expected to be completed in 2009, and will increase Sir Adam Beck's output by about 182 [[Megawatt|MW]] (4.2%).

[[Image:Niagara falls in dark.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Niagara Falls at night]]

[[Ship]]s can bypass Niagara Falls by means of the [[Welland Canal]], which in the 1960s was improved and incorporated into the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. While the seaway diverted water traffic from nearby [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and led to the demise of its steel and grain mills, other industries in the Niagara River valley flourished until the 1970s with the help of the electric power produced by the river. Since then the region has declined economically.

The cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada and Niagara Falls, New York, USA are connected by three bridges, including the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]], just downriver from the Falls, which affords the closest view of the Falls and is open to non-commercial vehicle traffic and pedestrians.  The [[Whirlpool Rapids Bridge]], 1.5 km (1 mi.) down from the Rainbow bridge and the oldest bridge over the Niagara river is open only to NEXUS Pass holders a limited amount of hours. The newest bridge, the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, is located near the escarpment. Nearby Niagara Falls International Airport and [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] were named after the waterfall, as were [[Niagara University]], countless local businesses, and even an asteroid.<ref name="Asteroid">Asteroid ''12382 Niagara Falls'' was named for the Falls.</ref>

== Preservation efforts ==
For the first two centuries after European settlement of the area, land on both sides of Niagara Falls was privately owned. Development and commercial ventures threatened the natural beauty of the area, and visitors sometimes had to pay entrepreneurs a fee to view the Falls through holes in a fence. Public dissatisfaction led to the ''Free Niagara'' movement, which included the artist [[Frederick Church]], the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], New York Assemblyman [[Thomas Vincent Welch]], and the journalist [[Jonathan Baxter Harrison]]. A series of Harrison's letters  to newspapers in Boston and New York (collected in the 1882 pamphlet ''The Condition of Niagara Falls, and the Measures Needed to Preserve Them'') were particularly influential in turning public opinion in favor of preservation.<ref name="Conservation movement">{{cite web

[[Image:Canadian Falls Aug 2004.JPG|thumb|300px|left|A closer view of the [[Horseshoe Falls, Canada|Horseshoe (Canadian) Falls]] in the early morning.]]
In 1885, New York state began to purchase land from developers, under the charter of the [[Niagara Falls State Park|Niagara Reservation State Park]]. In the same year, the province of Ontario in Canada established the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park for the same purpose. Both organizations have proved remarkably successful operations that have restricted development on both sides of the Falls and the Niagara River. On the Canadian side, the Niagara Parks Commission governs land usage along the entire course of the Niagara River, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.

Until the modern era, the Falls were receding southward owing to erosion from two to ten feet (0.6 to 3.0&nbsp;m) per year. This process was slowed initially by diversion of increasing amounts of flow from the Niagara River into hydroelectric plants in both the United States and Canada. On [[January 2]], [[1929]] [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] reached an agreement on an action plan to preserve the Falls. In 1950, the two countries signed the Niagara River Water Diversion Treaty, which more specifically addressed the issue of water diversion.

[[Image:dryniagara.jpg|thumb|American Falls "shut off" during erosion control efforts in 1969 (see text)]]
In addition to the effects of diversion of water to the power stations, erosion control efforts have included underwater [[weir]]s to redirect the most damaging currents, and actual mechanical strengthening of the top of the Falls. The most dramatic such work was performed in 1969. In June of that year, the Niagara River was completely diverted away from the American Falls for several months through the building of a temporary rock and earth dam (clearly visible in the photo at right), effectively shutting off the American Falls.<ref name="Ice Jam">This effect also obtained once as a result of natural forces, as an upstream ice jam stopped almost all water flow over Niagara Falls on [[March 29]], [[1848]].</ref> While the Horseshoe Falls absorbed the extra flow, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] studied the riverbed and mechanically bolted faults which would otherwise have hastened the retreat of the American Falls. A plan to remove the huge mound of [[Scree|talus]] deposited in 1954 was abandoned owing to cost, and in November 1969, the temporary dam was [[dynamite]]d, restoring flow to the American Falls. Even after these undertakings, [[Luna Island]], the small piece of land between the main waterfall and the Bridal Veil, remained off limits to the public for years owing to fears that it was unstable and could collapse into the gorge at any time.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Preservation efforts have extended beyond and above the Falls themselves. Recent construction of several tall buildings (most of them hotels) on the Canadian side has caused the airflow over the Falls to change direction. Students at the [[University of Guelph]] demonstrated, using scale models, that the air passes over the top of the new hotels, causing a breeze to roll down the south sides of the buildings and spill into the gorge below the Falls, where it feeds into a whirlpool of moisture and air. The result is that the viewing areas on the Canadian side are now often obscured by a layer of mist.<ref name="Discovery Channel">{{cite web

=== Over The Falls ===
[[Image:BobbyLeachNiagaraFalls.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Bobby Leach]] and his barrel after his trip over Niagara Falls, 1911]] 

In October 1829, [[Sam Patch]], who called himself ''The Yankee Leaper'', jumped over the Horseshoe Falls and became the first known person to survive the plunge. This began a long tradition of [[Stunt performer|daredevils]] trying to go over the Falls and survive. In 1901, 63-year-old [[Annie Edson Taylor]] was the first person to go over the Falls in a [[barrel (storage)|barrel]]; she survived virtually unharmed. Soon after exiting the barrel, she said, "No one should ever try that again." Since Taylor's historic ride, 14 other people have intentionally gone over the Falls in or on a device, despite her advice. Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors of such stunts face charges and stiff fines, as it is illegal, on both sides of the border, to attempt to go over the Falls. 

Other daredevils have made ''crossing the Falls'' their goal, starting with the successful passage by [[Blondin|Jean Fran<U+00E7>ois "Blondin" Gravelet]] in 1859. These [[tightrope walker]]s drew huge crowds to witness their exploits. Their wires ran across the gorge, near the current Rainbow Bridge, not over the waterfall itself. Among the many was Ontario's William Hunt, who billed himself as "Signor Fanini" and competed with Blondin in performing outrageous stunts over the gorge.  Englishman [[Matthew Webb|Captain Matthew Webb]], the first man to swim the [[English Channel]], drowned in 1883 after unsuccessfully trying to swim across the [[whirlpool]]s and rapids downriver from the Falls with nine other people. Two others drowned with him, and the other seven gave up before finishing their course.[[Image:Parent With Heroes.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Mr. and Mrs. Woodward meeting with the two heroes.]] 

In what some called the "Miracle at Niagara", [[Roger Woodward (Niagara Falls)|Roger Woodward]], a seven-year-old American boy, was swept over the Horseshoe Falls protected only by a life vest on [[July 9]], [[1960]], as two tourists pulled his 17-year-old sister Deanne from the river only 20 feet (6&nbsp;m) from the lip of the Horseshoe Falls at Goat Island.<ref name="Goat Island">{{cite web

}}</ref> The two men, both from New Jersey, and having never met previously, sprang into action. John R. Hayes, a truck driver for a local oil company and an auxiliary police officer from Union, New Jersey climbed over the rail, stretched out his arm and pleaded with Deanne. She later said that his pleading voice made her swim harder and she grabbed his thumb just inches from going over the Falls. Fearful that the current might break the hold on the young girl, Hayes shouted for help. Climbing over the railing was John Quattrochi of Pennsgrove, New Jersey, who came to aid the rescue and the two pulled the teenager to safety. Once on land Deanne's concern was for her brother. Quattrochi realizing another was still out there quietly whispered, "Pray for him." Minutes later, Roger was plucked from the roiling plunge pool beneath the Horseshoe Falls after grabbing a life ring thrown to him by the crew of the [[Maid of the Mist]] boat. His survival, which no one thought possible, made news throughout the world. 

On [[July 2]], [[1984]], Canadian [[Karel Soucek]] from [[Hamilton, Ontario]] successfully plunged over the Horseshoe Falls in a barrel with only minor injuries. Soucek was fined $500 for performing the stunt without a license.  In [[1985]], he was killed while attempting to re-create the stunt at the [[Houston Astrodome]] by climbing into a barrel and dropping 180 feet into a water tank in front of 45,000 people; his barrel hit the side of the tank.

In August 1985, [[Steve Trotter]], an aspiring stuntman from Rhode Island, became the youngest person ever (age 22) and the first American in 25 years to go over the Falls in a barrel. Ten years later, Trotter went over the Falls again, becoming the second person to go over the Falls twice and survive. It was also the second-ever "duo"; Lori Martin joined Trotter for the barrel ride over the Falls.  The first two-person trip over the brink goes to Jeffrey Petkovich (25) and Peter Debernardi (42) on September 27, 1989.

[[Kirk Jones (Niagara Falls)|Kirk Jones]] of [[Canton, Michigan]] became the first known person to survive a plunge over the Horseshoe Falls without a flotation device on [[October 20]], [[2003]]. While it is still not known whether Jones was determined to commit suicide, he survived the 16-story fall with only battered ribs, scrapes, and bruises.

No human has ever survived a plunge over the American Falls, owing to the many boulders and the relatively weak current. All survivors and daredevils have passed over the Horseshoe Falls, where there are fewer boulders and the current can "throw" a person farther away from the brink and (hopefully) avoid the boulders.

Already a huge tourist attraction and favorite spot for honeymooners, Niagara Falls visits rose sharply in 1953 after the release of ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'', a movie starring [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Later in the 20th century, the Falls was a featured location in 1980's movie ''[[Superman II]]'', and was itself the subject of a popular [[IMAX]] movie. Much of the episode ''[[Return of the Technodrome]]'' in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon series]] take place near the Niagara Falls and its hydroelectric plant. Illusionist [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] performed a trick in which he appeared to travel over the Horseshoe Falls in 1990. <!-- he probably didn't, but this would be difficult to prove -->The Falls, or more particularly, the tourist-supported complex near the Falls, was the setting of the short-lived American television show ''[[Wonderfalls]]'' in early 2004. With the recent influx of more international tourists, annual visits exceeded 14 million in 2003.

[[Charles Dickens]] described his visit to the falls in his [[1842]] travelogue, [[American Notes]]:

:When we were seated in the little ferry-boat, and were crossing the 
:swollen river immediately before both cataracts, I began to feel 
:what it was:  but I was in a manner stunned, and unable to 
:comprehend the vastness of the scene.  It was not until I came on 
:Table Rock, and looked - Great Heaven, on what a fall of bright-
:green water! - that it came upon me in its full might and majesty.
     
:Then, when I felt how near to my Creator I was standing, the first 
:effect, and the enduring one - instant and lasting - of the 
:tremendous spectacle, was Peace.  Peace of Mind, tranquillity, calm 
:recollections of the Dead, great thoughts of Eternal Rest and 
:Happiness:  nothing of gloom or terror.  Niagara was at once

:changeless and indelible, until its pulses cease to beat, for ever.

[[Image:NiagaraFallsManAndWoman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Man and woman on Canadian side of Niagara Falls, circa 1858]]Peak numbers of visitors occur in the summertime, when Niagara Falls are both a daytime and evening attraction. From the Canadian side, floodlights illuminate both sides of the Falls for several hours after dark (until midnight).  The number of visitors annually is approximately 20 million in year 2007 and by 2009 it is estimated to grow to 28 million tourists a year. 

[[Image:Niagara Falls - Canada - Closeup.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Tourist spot at the bottom of the Falls]]From the American side, the American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Park, which also features an observation tower. Nearby, the [[Cave of the Winds (New York)|Cave of the Winds]] trail leads hikers down some three hundred steps to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls. The ''Niagara Scenic Trolley'' offers guided trips along the American Falls. On the American side, stunning panoramic and aerial views of the falls can be viewed from the top floor of Frank Parlato Jr.'s One Niagara / Niagara Center (called "The greatest view in the world") , "The Flight of Angels" hot air balloon ride or by helicopter.

On the Canadian side, [[Queen Victoria Park]] features  manicured gardens, platforms offering spectacular views of both the American and Horseshoe Falls, and underground walkways leading into observation rooms which yield the illusion of being within the falling waters. The observation deck of the nearby [[Skylon Tower]] offers the highest overhead view of the Falls, and in the opposite direction gives views as far as distant Toronto.<ref name="Let's&nbsp;Go">''Let's Go Travel Guide'', 2004</ref> Along with the [[Minolta Tower]] (formerly the Konica Minolta Tower), it is one of two towers in Canada with a view of the Falls. 

[[Image:Picture 0043.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[American Falls]], [[Bridal Veil Falls (Niagara Falls)|Bridal Veil Falls]], and a [[Maid of the Mist]] boat.]]Along the Niagara River, the ''Niagara River Recreational Trail'' runs the 35 miles (56&nbsp;km) from Fort Erie to Fort George, and includes many historical sites from the [[War of 1812]].

The ''[[Maid of the Mist]]'' cruises, named for an ancient Ongiara Indian mythical character, have carried passengers into the whirlpools beneath the Falls since 1846. The [[Whirlpool Aero Car]], built in 1916 from a design by Spanish engineer [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]], is a [[aerial tramway|cable car]] which takes passengers over the whirlpool on the Canadian side.

The ''[[Journey Behind the Falls]]'' - accessible by elevators from the street level entrance - consists of an observation platform and series of tunnels near the bottom of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.
