The '''Dhammak<U+0101>ya Movement''' is a Buddhist movement founded in [[Thailand]] in the 1970s.

==Origins==
It was founded by the Thai meditation master [[Phramongkolthepmuni]](1885<U+2013>1959) - a celebrated meditation master and the late abbot of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, [[Thonburi]]. The movement is primarily represented today by its non-profit foundation, the Dhammakaya Foundation, and the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple in Pathum Thani Province, Thailand.

==Identifying features==
This meditation school formally belongs to the ancient [[Maha Nikaya]] tradition of Thai [[Theravada]] Buddhism.,<ref>Swearer, D. K. (1991) Fundemantalistic Movements in Theravada Buddhism, in: M. E. Marty & R. S. Appleby (Eds) ''Fundamentalisms Observed'' (Chicago & London, University of Chicago Press), p.656</ref> being correctly regarded as [[revivalist]] rather than a [[new religious movement|new movement]] or a [[fundamentalist]] movement.<ref>Cousins, L. S. (1996) The Origins of Insight Meditation, in: T. Skorupski (Ed) ''The Buddhist Forum: Seminar Papers, 1994-1996'' (London, University of London School of Oriental and African Studies), p.39.</ref><ref>Heikkil<U+00E4>-Horn, M-J (1996) Two Paths to Revivalism in Thai Buddhism: The Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke Movements, ''Temenos'' 32, pp.93-111</ref> It supposedly has many doctrinal elements to distinguish it from conventional Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and in some respects resembles the [[tathagatagarbha]] (Buddha Nature) doctrines of [[Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na]] Buddhism<ref>Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Routledge, Oxford, Second Edition, 2009, pp. 126-128</ref>, but has not been taken as heterodox by most Buddhists in Thailand.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Dhammak<U+0101>ya school of meditation is marked by its literal interpretation of Buddhist technical terms, (including the term ''[[Dharmakaya|''dhammak<U+0101>ya'']]'') in their physical meaning, as described by Phramongkolthepmuni. Many sermons of Phramongkolthepmuni himself can be traced back to some schools of meditation in [[Southeast Asia]] preserved only in ancient meditation manuals.

==Personalities==
One factor which catalyzes this Foundation is the personality of Phramongkolthepmuni (1884<U+2013>1959) . The account of his attaining dhammak<U+0101>ya in 1916 through his willingness to lay down his life evoked the image of 'self-sacrifice' in the minds of his disciples.

==Dhammakaya Foundation==

The '''Dhammak<U+0101>ya Foundation''' was founded in 1916 in Thailand by [[Phra Monkolthepmuni]], the [[abbot]] of [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen]]. Following the death of Phra Monkolthepmuni, the Foundation's work was continued by his disciple, Khun Yay Mah<U+0101> Ratana Up<U+0101>sik<U+0101> [[Chandra Khonnokyoong]], a Buddhist ''[[mae chi]]''. In 1970, a temple, called [[Wat Phra Dhammakaya]], was constructed as a home for the movement. Located in Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani Province, the temple was intended to become an international center for the study of meditation.

'''Wat Phra Dhammakaya''' is a Buddhist temple (''[[wat]]'') in [[Amphoe Khlong Luang|Khlong Luang District]], [[Pathum Thani Province]] north of Bangkok, Thailand. It was established on Magha Puja Day, 20 February 1970, on an eighty-acre (320,000 m<U+00B2>) plot of land donated by Lady Prayat Phaetayapongsa-visudhathibodi. The site, sixteen kilometres north of [[Don Mueang International Airport|Bangkok International Airport]], was originally called 'Soon Buddacakk-patipatthamm'. From acidic paddy fields, a woodland was created: a parkland for meditators. The foundation stone for the main chapel laid by H.R.H. Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]] on behalf of H.M. the King in December 1977 marked the official foundation of the centre as a temple<U+2014>Wat Phra Dhammakaya. The movement produced a CDROM<ref>Dhammakaya Foundation (1995) Palitext Version 1.0: CD-ROM Database of the Entire Buddhist Pali Canon (Bangkok, Darnsutha) ISBN 978-974-8235-87-5</ref> of the Pali Buddhist Scriptures in cooperation with the [[Pali Text Society]] in 1995 and by the year 2000 its monastic students were the most successful Pali students in Thailand.<ref>Trainor, Kevin (2004) Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide (London, Duncan Baird), p.216.</ref>

==Public accusations of 1999-2002==
The Dhammak<U+0101>ya Foundation has been subject to its share of controversy. In 1999<ref name="Asiaweek 17 September 1999">"'I Will Never Be Disrobed' says Thai abbot of Dhammakaya Temple", and "Between Faith and Fund-Raising", ''Asiaweek'' 17 September 1999</ref><ref>David Liebhold (1999) Trouble in Nirvana: Facing charges over his controversial methods, a Thai abbot sparks debate over Buddhism's future ''Time Asia'' 28 July 1999 [http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990628/monks1.html]</ref> and again in 2002,<ref>Yasmin Lee Arpon (2002) Scandals Threaten Thai Monks' Future ''SEAPA'' 11 July 2002 [http://www.seapabkk.org/fellowships/2002/yasmin.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&id=59039&usrsess= Controversial monk faces fresh charges ''The Nation'' 26 April 2002]</ref> leaders of the organization were accused of charges ranging from fraud and embezzlement to corruption. At that time social critic [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] criticized the Dhammakaya Movement for promoting greed by emphasizing donations to the temple as a way to make merit. Widespread negative media coverage a this time was symptomatic of the movement being made the [[scapegoat]] for commercial malpractice in the Thai Buddhist temple community<ref>Wiktorin, Pierre (2005) ''De Villkorligt Frigivna: Relationen mellan munkar och lekfolk i ett nutida Thailand'' (Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell International) p.137 ISSN 1653-6355</ref><ref>Julian Gearing (1999) Buddhist Scapegoat?: One Thai abbot is taken to task, but the whole system is to blame ''Asiaweek'' 30 December 1999 [http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/intelligence/9912/30/]<

In 2006 The Thai National Office for Buddhism cleared the Dhammakaya Foundation and Phrarajbhavanavisudh of all accusations<ref>[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=52,3073,0,0,1,0 ''Bangkok Post'' 23 August 2006]</ref> when Phrarajbhavanavisudh agreed to return all the allegedly embezzled funds to name of his temple. Phrarajbhavanavisudh was subsequently restored to the position of abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya.<ref>''Yuwa Song News Today'' 23 August 2006</ref>

==Present==
Under the leadership of president [[Phrarajbhavanavisudh]] (Luang Phaw Dhammajayo, b.1944), the image of the Dhammak<U+0101>ya Foundation has made a recovery, and in 2004-5 had received further recognition for its contribution to world peace from organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Thai Senate, and several peoples' associations in the South of Thailand. The Dhammakaya Movement continues to influence millions of people in Thailand and worldwide to practice [[Dhammakaya meditation]]. The movement has set up [[Dhammakaya Open University]] in [[Azusa, California]] in 2003 to offer degree courses in Buddhist studies. It has also encouraged Thais to quit [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]] and [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] through the activities of Anti-Drinking and Anti-Smoking program. [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) presented the 2004 [[World No Tobacco Day]] Award for this work on 31 May 2004<ref>Tawandhamma Foundation (2007) ''The Sun of Peace'' (Bangkok: New Witek), p.180</ref> [http://www.dhammakaya.or.th/recognitions/award_WHO.php]  

The movement has expanded branches to over eighteen countries worldwide and is promoted via a Buddhist satellite network or Dhamma Media Channel ([[DMC.TV]]) with a 24 hour-a-day Dharma and meditation teachings broadcast to the audience worldwide.

Accusations that the Thai Government had financed activities at Wat Phra Dhammakaya were made in a letter by Sulak Sivalaksa on 10 May 2010<ref>[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/37120/chinnaworn-halts-moral-conduct-plan Chinnaworn halts moral conduct plan]</ref> but the government issued a press release on 12 May to deny the  accusations<ref>[http://edunews.eduzones.com/67872/%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B2/%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AF%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%20%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%98.%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C%20MOU%20%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%90.-%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%20%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%88%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87 <U+0E19><U+0E32><U+0E22><U+0E01><U+0E2F> <U+0E08><U+0E35><U+0E49> <U+0E28><U+0E18>.<U+0E40><U+0E04><U+0E25><U+0E35><U+0E22><U+0E23><U+0E4C> MOU <U+0E2A><U+0E1E><U+0E10>.-<U+0E18><U+0E23><U+0E23><U+0E21><U+0E01><U+0E32><U+0E22> <U+0E43><U+0E2B><U+0E49><U+0E01><U+0E23><U+0E30><U+0E08><U+0E48><U+0E32><U+0E07>]</ref>
