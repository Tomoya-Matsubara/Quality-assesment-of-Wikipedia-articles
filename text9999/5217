'''Sean Thomas Casey''' (born [[July 2]], [[1974]] in [[Willingboro Township, New Jersey]]<ref>Stringer, Matt. [http://media.www.temple-news.com/media/storage/paper143/news/2003/11/20/Features/Philadelphia.The.Cradle.Of.Baseball-564047.shtml?sourcedomain=www.temple-news.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com "Philadelphia: The cradle of baseball"], ''[[The Temple News]]'', [[November 20]], [[2003]]. Accessed [[December 3]], [[2007]]. "For example, Sean Casey, a lifetime .300 hitter, plays first base for the Cincinnati Reds and hails from Willingboro, NJ."</ref>), nicknamed "the Mayor," is a [[first baseman]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who is currently a free agent.

==Baseball career==
Casey attended [[Upper St. Clair High School]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and graduated from the [[University of Richmond]], where he was a member of the [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] fraternity. His .461 batting average in 1995 led all Division I players<ref>{{cite web

  | url = http://richmondspiders.cstv.com/hallfame/rich-hallfame.html#seancase
  | accessdate = 2008-04-09}}</ref>, he was drafted in {{by|1995}} in the 2nd round by the [[Cleveland Indians]] and was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] before the {{by|1998}} season. Casey had his best year in {{by|1999}} hitting .332 with 25 HRs and 99 RBIs  and 103 runs scored in 151 games. In 1999, he won the [[Hutch Award]].

During his tenure in Cincinnati, and later in Detroit, Sean Casey was regarded as approachable and friendly, and his nickname, "the Mayor", comes from his reputation for chatting casually with every runner who makes it to first base, and from his very public charity work. It was frequently expanded to "the Mayor of Riverfront" when the Reds played at [[Cinergy Field|Riverfront Stadium]]. On May 16, 2007, Casey was voted in 2007 as "the friendliest player in baseball" by fellow players in a Sports Illustrated poll.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-04-09}}</ref> He garnered 46% of the vote with the second place player [[Jim Thome]] getting only 7%.  Casey is also regarded as among the slowest-running players in the game, grounding into 27 [[double play]]s in the {{by|2005}} season.  This tied him with [[A.J. Pierzynski]] for the record of most Grounding in Double Plays by a National League Left Hander in a season.<ref>{{cite web

Sean Casey was signed to the Reds through the {{by|2006}} season. However, he was traded [[December 6]], 2005 to his hometown [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for [[left-handed]] pitcher [[Dave Williams (baseball)|Dave Williams]]. During an injury plagued 2006 season, Casey hit .296 with three home runs and 29 RBI in 59 games for the Pirates. On [[July 31]], 2006, Casey was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for minor league pitcher [[Brian Rogers]]. During the [[2006 American League Championship Series]] against the [[Oakland Athletics]] he partially tore his left calf muscle in Game 1<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061011&content_id=1708998&vkey=ps2006news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title= Casey expected to miss rest of ALCS|accessdate=2008-04-11 }}</ref>. After coming back from his torn calf in Game 2 of the World Series, he became the hottest hitter for the Tigers, belting 2 home runs and batting in five games. His .432 batting average was one of the best in Tigers postseason history. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://static.record-eagle.com/2006/nov/17casey.htm|title=Tigers re-sign 1B Casey |accessdate=2008-04-11 |author=Jeff Peek |date=2006-11-17}}</ref>

Casey has made the sports news for his charitable work almost as often as his fieldwork. He has been active in [[Big Brothers]] and [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], as well as the "Casey's Crew" program, where he provided free high-priced tickets to disadvantaged youth.<ref>{{cite web

After being told by [[Dave Dombrowski]] and [[Jim Leyland]] that he would not be re-signed, Casey still praised [[Mike Ilitch]], Dombrowski, and Jim Leyland for giving him the opportunity to come play for Detroit. Casey said "They let me know. I've had a great time with this team, the greatest year and a half of my career. It was great. But I understand the situation."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mlbplayers.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlbpa/y2007/m10/d03/c2247004.jsp|title= Casey bids farewell to Tigers |accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>

On February 5, 2008, the [[Boston Red Sox]] officially announced they had signed Casey to a one-year deal.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080205&content_id=2365093&vkey=hotstove2007&fext=.jsp The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
On April 9, 2008, Red Sox third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] injured his thumb and was then placed on the DL, first baseman [[Kevin Youkilis]] was moved to third, and Casey stepped in as the starting first baseman<ref>{{cite web|title = Red Sox's Lowell leaves game with thumb injury| publisher = Sporting News|url = http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=397799| accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> and exploded by making some good defensive plays and hitting .318 with five RBIs in his first seven games. He was on the disabled list from 26 April through 12 May, and returned as a significant part-time player, finishing the regular season with a .773 OPS on 199 at-bats in 69 games.

Casey was suspended by the [[MLB]] for three games after his actions in the [[Coco Crisp|Crisp]]-[[James Shields (pitcher)|Shields]] brawl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/sports/x2058734026/Three-Sox-five-Rays-suspended-for-brawl|title=Three Sox, five Rays suspended for brawl|last=Farley|first=Glen|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref>
