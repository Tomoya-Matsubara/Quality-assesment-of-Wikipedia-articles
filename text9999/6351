==Early years==
Ameondola attended [[The Woodlands High School]] in [[The Woodlands, Texas]], under coach Weldon Willig.<ref name=Tech>{{cite web|title=Danny Amendola: Football|publisher=Texas Tech Athletics|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/amendola_danny00.html|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> He completed his high school career by leading his team to its first ever Texas State championship game. Although they lost to [[North Shore High School]], Amendola finished his [[Twelfth grade|senior]] season with 1,045 receiving yards, 129 rushing yards, and 8 [[touchdown]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highlanderfootball.net/history/pastseasons/2003stats.pdf|title=2003 High School Statistics|publisher=highlanderfootball.net|date=2008-08-06}}</ref>

==College career==
[[File:DAmendola.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Amendola as a freshman at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]]]]
Amendola finished his college career at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] with 204 receptions for 2,246 yards and 15 [[touchdown]]s. He also returned 116 punts for 1,283 yards and one TD, an 11.06 yards per return average ranking Amendola third all-time in school history in punt returns and yardage, behind only [[Wes Welker]] and Tyrone Thurman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/amendola_danny00.html|title=Player Bio: Danny Amendola|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Amendola's best year was his [[2007 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|senior year]], in which he was overshadowed by teammate [[Michael Crabtree]], but still recorded 109 catches for 1,245 yards and 6 TDs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/players/115978|title=Danny Amendola Statistics|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]}}</ref>

During the 2005 season, Amendola made two memorable plays that led to Red Raider victories.  The first was late in the 2005 game against [[Oklahoma Sooners football under Bob Stoops#2005|Oklahoma]]. Tech was trailing. On fourth down, a [[Cody Hodges]] pass attempt was tipped, and Amendola made a leaping catch in traffic.  He was tackled immediately and appeared to have been stopped just short of a first down. However, the spot was reviewed by the replay officials and the final spot of the ball resulted in a first down. The drive was kept alive and resulted in yet another disputed call<U+2014>[[Taurean Henderson]]'s stretch over the goal line on the final play of regulation, which gave the Red Raiders the victory over the Sooners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redraiders.com/stories/112105/foo_112105016.shtml|title=Calls don't bother Tech coach|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]''}}</ref>

Another game-changing play came when Amendola recovered the fumble from an intercepted pass during the final drive of the 2005 game against [[2005 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]]. Tech needed a touchdown to win. Tech quarterback [[Cody Hodges]]' pass was tipped and intercepted. Instead of taking a knee to seal the victory, the Nebraska defender decided to run with the ball and had it stripped. Amendola dove for the loose ball and recovered it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2005/10/13/Sports/Playing.From.Heart.Has.Duel.Meaning.For.Hodges.Family-1281713.shtml|title=Playing from heart has duel meaning for Hodges family|accessdate=2008-07-01|publisher=''[[The Daily Toreador]]''}}</ref> Tech retained possession, resulting in a game-winning touchdown pass from Hodges to [[Joel Filani]] on fourth down with under 30 seconds remaining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redraiders.com/stories/100905/foo_100905021.shtml|title=Tech leaves 'Huskers shell-shucked|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]''}}</ref> Amendola graduated with a major in Communication Studies.<ref name=Tech />
