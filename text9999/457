The '''Emerald Toucanet''' (''Aulacorhynchus prasinus'') is a [[near-passerine]] [[bird]] occurring in mountainous regions from [[Mexico]], through [[Central America]], to northern [[Venezuela]] and along the [[Andes]] as far south as central [[Bolivia]]. Some [[taxa]] currently included in this species are sometimes split into separate species (''see [[Emerald Toucanet#Taxonomy|Taxonomy]]'').

==Description==
Like other [[toucan]]s, the Emerald Toucanet is brightly marked and has a large [[beak|bill]]. The adult is {{convert|30|-|35|cm|in}} long and weight can range from {{convert|118|-|230|g|oz}}<ref>http://www.nashvillezoo.org/piciformes/ramphastidae.htm</ref><ref>"Toucans, Barbets & Honeyguides" by Lester Short & Jennifer Horne. Oxford University Press (2001), ISBN 0-19-85466-1</ref> The sexes are alike in appearance, although the female generally is smaller and slightly shorter-billed. It is, as other members of the [[genus]] ''[[Aulacorhynchus]]'', mainly green. The vent and tail-tip are rufous. The bill is black with yellow to the upper mandible (amount depends on the exact [[subspecies]]) and, in all except the nominate (''prasinus'') and ''wagleri'' groups (''see Taxonomy''), a white band at the base of the bill. The members of the ''caeruleogularis'' group have a rufous patch near the base of the upper mandible, while some members of the ''albivitta'' group have a rufous patch near the base of the lower mandible. The throat is white in the nominate and the ''wagleri'' group, blue in the ''caeruleogularis'' and ''cognatus'' group, pale grey-blue in the ''lautus'' group, blue or black in the ''atrogularis'' group, and white or grey-blue in the ''albivitta'' group. The eye-ring ranges from blue to red, in some subspecies very dark, almost appearing blackish from a distance. The legs are dull greyish and the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is dark.

[[Juvenile (organism)|Juveniles]] are duller, incl. the throat, and, depending on [[subspecies]], the black areas of the bill are replaced with dusky or the bill is entirely yellowish.

==Habitat and behavior==
[[File:Aulacorhynchus prasinus -Costa Rica-8.jpg|left|thumb|Despite their bright colours, Emerald Toucanets, such as this individual in [[Costa Rica]], can be surprisingly difficult to see]]
The Emerald Toucanet is a generally common in humid [[forest]] and woodland, mainly at higher elevations. The 3<U+2013>4 white [[bird egg|eggs]] are laid in an unlined hole in a tree, usually an old [[woodpecker]] [[bird nest|nest]], but sometimes a natural cavity. Both sexes incubate the eggs for 14<U+2013>15 days, and the chicks remain in the nest after hatching. They are blind and naked at birth, and have short bills and specialised pads on their heels to protect them from the rough floor of the nest. They are fed by both parents, and [[fledge]] after about 6 weeks. They are fed for several weeks after leaving the nest.

Small flocks, usually consisting of 5<U+2013>10 birds, move through the forest in "follow-my-leader" style with a direct and rapid flight. This species is primarily an arboreal [[frugivore|fruit-eater]], but will also take [[insect]]s, [[lizard]]s, bird eggs, and other small prey.

The [[bird call|calls]] of the Emerald Toucanet are a loud dry ''rrip rrip rrip rrip rrip'' and a ''graval graval graval''. It has been suggested that the two different calls are given by the two sexes. There are also croaking alarm and aggression calls.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Aulacorhynchus prasinus - NBII Image Gallery-2003.jpg|Right|thumb|This subspecies, ''cyanolaemus'', is the only member of ''atrogularis'' group with a blue (not black) throat. No other subspecies has less yellow to the bill]]

It has been suggested that the Emerald Toucanet actually should be split into 7 species (below described as they roughly occur from north to south):

* '''Wagler's Toucanet''' (''Aulacorhynchus wagleri''). [[Endemism|Endemic]] to south-western Mexico. [[Monotypic]].
* '''Emerald Toucanet''' (''Aulacorhynchus prasinus''). Found from southern Mexico to [[Nicaragua]]. Includes subspecies ''warneri'', ''virescens'', ''stenorhabdus'', ''chiapensis'' and ''volcanius''.
* '''[[Blue-throated Toucanet]]''' (''Aulacorhynchus caeruleogularis''). Found in [[Costa Rica]] to western [[Panama]]. Incl. subspecies ''maxillaris''.
* '''Violet-throated''' or '''Nelson's Toucanet''' (''Aulacorhynchus cognatus''). Found in eastern Panama and adjacent far north-western [[Colombia]]. Monotypic.
* '''Santa Marta Toucanet''' (''Aulacorhynchus lautus''). Endemic to the [[Santa Marta Mountains]] in northern Colombia. Monotypic.
* '''(North) Andean Toucanet''' (''Aulacorhynchus albivitta''). Found in the Andes from western Venezuela, through Colombia to northern [[Ecuador]]. Incl. subspecies ''griseigularis'' and ''phaeolaemus''.
* '''Black-throated''' or '''Peruvian Toucanet''' (''Aulacorhynchus atrogularis''). Found from southern Ecuador, through [[Peru]], far western [[Brazil]] (in the state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]), to central Bolivia. Incl. subspecies ''dimidiatus'' and ''cyanolaemus''.

These splits are mainly based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[plumage]] as described by Navarro ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=Navarro2001>Navarro, A., Peterson, A., L<U+00F3>pez-Medrano, E., and Ben<U+00ED>tez-D<U+00ED>az, H. (2001). ''Species limits in Mesoamerican ''Aulocorhynchus'' Toucanets.'' The Wilson Bull. 113(4): 363-372</ref> Their results were preliminary, as they themselves pointed out. As a result most authorities, notably [[South American Classification Committee|SACC]], do not recognize more than a single widespread species, but recognize the need for a solution to this complex.<ref>Remsen, J. V., Jr., C. D. Cadena, A. Jaramillo, M. Nores, J. F. Pacheco, J. P<U+00E9>rez-Em<U+00E1>n, M. B. Robbins, F. G. Stiles, D. F. Stotz, and K. J. Zimmer (2011). ''[http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline05.html A classification of the bird species of South America: Trogoniformes to Piciformes.]'' American Ornithologists' Union. Accessed 25 May 2011</ref> They are clearly separate species as per the [[phylogenetic species concept]], but judging the species limits as per the [[biological species concept]] is difficult due to the entirely [[allopatric]] distributions of the various groups.<ref name=Navarro2001/> There are no major vocal differences between the various populations, but that in itself is not unusual for separate species that do not overlap.<ref name=Navarro2001/>

[[Genetics|Genetic]] evidence has to some extent supported the above splits, although with different borders between the species in the northern Andes, and of the above suggested species, data is lacking for ''lautus''.<ref name=Bonaccorso2011>Bonaccorso, E., Guayasamin, J. M., Peterson, A. T., and Navarro-Sig<U+00FC>enza, A. G. (2011). ''Molecular phylogeny and systematics of Neotropical toucanets in the genus Aulacorhynchus (Aves, Ramphastidae).'' Zoologica Scripta, 40. {{doi|10.1111/j.1463-6409.2011.00475.x}}</ref><ref name=PueblaOlivares2008>Puebla-Olivares, F., E. Bonaccorso, A. E. de los Monteros, K. E. Omland, J. E. Llorente-Bousquets, A. T. Peterson, and A.G. Navarro-Siguenza. (2008). ''Speciation in the Emerald Toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus) complex.'' The Auk. 125(1): 39-50.</ref> According to their genetic results, the north Ecuadorian toucanets, which are white-throated and usually included in ''albivitta'',<ref name=Ecuador>Ridgely, R. S., and Greenfield, P. J. (2001). ''The Birds of Ecuador''. ISBN 0-8014-8720-X (vol. 1), ISBN 0-8014-8721-8 (vol. 2)</ref> are closer to the ''atrogularis'' group than "true" ''albivitta'' of Colombia and Venezuela.<ref name=PueblaOlivares2008/> Assuming this is correct, it seems likely that north Ecuadorian toucanets represent a new [[taxon]], which should be treated as a subspecies of ''A. atrogularis''. They also found that ''griseigularis'' was closer to the ''atrogularis'' group than ''albivitta'', but unlike the north Ecuadorian toucanets, they opted for treating it as a separate species, the Grey-throated or Plumbeous-throated Toucanet (''A. griseigularis'').<ref name=Bonaccorso2011/><ref name=PueblaOlivares2008/> In that case, ''A. albivitta'' is known as the White-throated Toucanet.<ref name=Bonaccorso2011/> If ''albivitta'' and ''griseigularis'' are treated as separate species, it is unclear where ''phaeolaemus'' belongs, as genetic data for that taxon is missing. In appearance and distribution ''phaeolaemus'' is closest to ''griseigularis'',<ref>Fjelds<U+00E5>, J., and Krabbe, N. (1990). ''Birds of the High Andes.'' ISBN 87-88757-16-1</ref><ref>Restall, R. L., Rodner, C., and Lentino, M. (2006). ''Birds of Northern South America.'' ISBN 0-7136-7243-9 (vol. 1). ISBN 0-7136-7242-0 (vol. 2).</ref> but inexplicably it has been suggested it should be treated as a subspecies of ''A. albivitta''.<ref name=Bonaccorso2011/> In 2011 it was also suggested that ''cyanolaemus'' should be treated as a subspecies of ''A. albivitta'',<ref name=Bonaccorso2011/> but this was presumably an error, as it directly contradicts genetic data, which place it in ''A. atrogularis''.<ref name=PueblaOlivares2008/> 

Another potential problem relates to the distribution limit between ''A. cognatus'' and ''A. caeruleogularis'' in Panama. Although the reason for this treatment is unclear, the population in central Panama has been placed in ''A. caeruleogularis'', which would limit ''A. cognatus'' to extreme eastern Panama and adjacent Colombia.<ref name=Bonaccorso2011/><ref name=PueblaOlivares2008/> According to George Angehr, author of ''The Birds of Panama'',<ref>Angehr, G., and Dean, R. (2011). ''The Birds of Panama.'' ISBN 978-0-8014-7674-7</ref> it is possible toucanets from central Panama actually are closer to ''A. cognatus''.<ref>Miller, M. (2009).

The Emerald Toucanet is a popular pet toucan. It is affectionate when hand-fed and loves to play and interact with its owner.  Emerald Toucanets are as quick to learn tricks as [[cockatoo]]s. They are active and need a large cage for their size, including perches that they can hop back and forth on.  They also require a high-fruit diet, without which they are susceptible to a disease of excessive iron storage that is similar to [[hemochromatosis]] in humans.
