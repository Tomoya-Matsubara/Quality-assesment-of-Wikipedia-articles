'''Jesus Christ "J.C." Watts''' (born [[November 18]], [[1957]]) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]] [[politician]], CNN political contributor, and former [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Oklahoma]] in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].

==Early life and sports career==
Watts was born in [[Eufaula, Oklahoma]].  After graduating from high school in [[1976]], Watts was recruited by and attended college at the [[University of Oklahoma]].  Chosen to play the [[quarterback]] position, Watts led the OU Sooners college football team to consecutive [[Big Eight Conference]] titles and [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] championships under the leadership of head coach [[Barry Switzer]].  He graduated in [[1981]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] [[academic degree|degree]] in [[journalism]]. 

Between [[1981]] to [[1986]], Watts played professional football in the [[Canadian Football League]] for the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], receiving the [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]] award during his [[rookie]] season in a Grey Cup loss to [[Warren Moon]] and the [[Edmonton Eskimos]].  Watts continued to play the quarterback position (which had brought him success at OU). After his retirement, Watts was replaced ultimately, several years later, by [[Damon Allen]] as quarterback for the eastern Riders.  By the end of his football career, Watts had played against such quarterbacks as [[Damon Allen]], [[Matt Dunigan]], [[Tom Clements]], [[Condredge Holloway]], [[Dieter Brock]], [[Joe Paopao]], [[Danny Barrett]], and [[Vince Ferragamo]] during his sojourn in the CFL.

==Religious work==
After retiring from professional football in Canada, Watts returned to Oklahoma and began work with the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] Church.  Watts served as a Southern Baptist youth [[Religious minister|minister]] and [[pastor|associate pastor]] in [[Del City, Oklahoma]] from [[1987]] to [[1994]].

==Political career==
Watts was approached by several prominent [[Oklahoma Republican Party|Oklahoma Republicans]] and asked to run for a seat on the [[Oklahoma Corporation Commission]].  After defeating several other candidates in the state Republican primary, Watts won in [[November]], [[1990]], and was the first [[African-American]] elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.  Many Oklahoma African-Americans who would have probably voted for the [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate instead crossed over to vote for Watts (helping him to win).

Four years later, Watts was again approached by prominent Oklahoma Republican leaders and asked to consider running for an open seat for [[United States Congress|Congress]] (Oklahoma's 4th Congressional district, being vacated by Congressman [[Dave McCurdy]]).  Watts agreed and in November, [[1994]], was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  He garnered attention soon after his election by declining to join the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], saying it was "infested" with "Democratic liberals who betray black people in America."

Watts captured national attention in [[1996]] with a speech before the Republican national convention, when he said, "You see character does count. For too long we have gotten by in a society that says the only thing right is to get by and the only thing wrong is to get caught.  Character is doing what's right when nobody is looking. " [http://www.northerncityjournal.com/files/vol01_26.html]

Continuing to be a rising star for the national Republican Party, Watts was selected in [[1997]] to deliver the Republican response to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[State of the Union Address]].  Later that year, Watts stirred up [[controversy]] when he branded some unnamed black Democrats and [[civil rights]] leaders as "race-hustling poverty pimps." [http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=13545]. 

In [[1998]], Watts was chosen by the Republican House Leadership to be the [[chairman]] of the [[House Republican Conference]], the 4th highest position of leadership in the House of Representatives (behind the [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker]], the [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Majority Leader]], and the [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]]).

Although elected on a pledge to serve no more than two terms, Watts sought and won a fourth term in [[2000]]. In [[2002]] he decided not to run for re-election, publicly citing a desire to spend more time with his family.

Watts then became chaiman of [[GOPAC]] [http://www.gopac.com/gopac_about.php] until he was succeeded [[February 1,]] [[2007]] by [[Maryland]]'s former Lt. Governor [[Michael S. Steele]] [http://www.gopac.com/gopac_chairmans_corner.php], whose loss to [[Benjamin L. Cardin]] combined with [[George_Allen_%28U.S._politician%29|George Allen]]'s in Virginia helped cede [[United States Senate]] control to the [[Democratic_Party_(United_States)|Democrats]]. GOPAC was founded by [[Delaware]] Governor [[Pierre S. du Pont]] in 1978 in "an effort to build a farm team of Republican officeholders who could then run for congress or higher state offices later." [http://www.gopac.com/gopac_chairmans_corner.php]. Other past Chairmen of GOPAC were: former [[Oklahoma]] Governor [[Frank Keating]], [[California]] Congressman [[David Dreier]], [[Arizona]] Congressman [[John Shadegg]] and former [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].

==Post-Congressional career==
He is chairman of the J.C. Watts Companies, which works with clients on strategies for [[business]] development, [[telecommunication|communications]] and [[public affairs]]. He serves on the boards of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], the [[United States Military Academy]], [[Africare]], [[BNSF Railway]], [[Clear Channel Communications]], [[Dillard's]] and [[Terex Corporation]]. He is the current chairman of [[GOPAC]].  He writes a monthly column for ''[[The Sporting News]]'' and is a frequent [[political commentator]] on many nationally-syndicated [[American politics|political]] [[talk show]]s, including ''[[The Tavis Smiley Show]],'' [[The Situation Room]], ''[[Hannity and Colmes]],'' and ''[[Meet the Press]].''

In [[2004]], he became a spokesman for [[National Grants Conferences]], a group that offers through infomercials access to millions of dollars in government subsidies.

==Quotes==

:"...they said that I had sold out and Uncle Tom. And I said well, they deserve to have that view. But I have my thoughts. And I think they're race-hustling poverty pimps."
