'''Big Star''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in 1971 by [[Alex Chilton]], [[Chris Bell (musician)|Chris Bell]], [[Jody Stephens]] and Andy Hummel. The group broke up in 1974, but reorganized with a new line-up nearly 20 years later and is active today. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the work of [[British Invasion]] groups including [[The Beatles]] and [[The Kinks]], as well as [[The Byrds]], [[The Beach Boys]], and other U.S. acts. To the resulting [[power pop]], Big Star added dark, nihilistic themes, and produced a style that foreshadowed the [[alternative rock]] of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a "seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations" in the words of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',<ref name="rollingstone" /> earning recognition decades later, according to [[Allmusic]], as the "quintessential American power pop band" and "one of the most mythic and influential [[cult following|cult acts]] in all of rock & roll".<ref name="ankeny">Ankeny</ref>

Big Star's first album, ''[[Number 1 Record|#1 Record]]'' (1972), met with enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by [[Stax Records]] and limited distribution stunted commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations and by the time a second album was completed in January 1974, both Bell and Hummel had left. Like ''#1&nbsp;Record'', ''[[Radio City (album)|Radio City]]'' received excellent reviews, but record company problems again thwarted sales<U+2014>[[Columbia Records]], which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album was deemed too uncommercial for release and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled ''[[Third/Sister Lovers]]'', it found limited commercial success. Shortly thereafter, Bell was killed in a car accident.

The Big Star discography drew renewed attention in the 1980s when [[R.E.M.]] and other popular bands acknowledged its influence. In 1992, further interest was stimulated by [[Rykodisc]]'s [[reissue]]s of the band's albums, complemented by a collection of Bell's solo work.<ref name="Borack p13">Borack, 13</ref> In 1993, Chilton and Stephens reformed Big Star with recruits [[Jon Auer]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]] of [[the Posies]], and gave a concert at the [[University of Missouri]].<ref name="columbia">Jovanovic, 253</ref> The band has remained active since, performing tours in Europe and Japan,<ref name="jovanovic pp253-60">Jovanovic, 253<U+2013>260</ref> and released a new studio album, ''[[In Space]]'', in 2005.

==First era: 1971 to 1974==
===''#1 Record''===
After performing as lead singer with [[blue-eyed soul]] group [[The Box Tops]] from 1967 to 1970, earning him the #1 hit "[[The Letter (song)|The Letter]]" at the age of sixteen, [[Alex Chilton]] recorded a solo studio album.<ref name="jovanovic pp76-89">Jovanovic, 76&ndash;89</ref> He was offered the role of lead vocalist for [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], but turned the offer down as "too commercial".<ref name="jovanovic pp76-89" /> Chilton had known [[Chris Bell (musician)|Chris Bell]] for some time: both lived in Memphis, each had spent time recording music at [[Ardent Studios]],<ref>Creswell, Toby. ''1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them''. Da Capo Press, 2006. 277. ISBN 978-1560259152</ref> and each, when aged 13, had been struck by the music of [[The Beatles]] when [[The Beatles in the United States|the band first came to the U.S. in 1964]].<ref>Jovanovic, 6&ndash;13, 27&ndash;30</ref> A song Chilton wrote nearly six years after first seeing The Beatles, "[[Thirteen (song)|Thirteen]]", referred to the event with the line "Rock 'n' roll is here to stay".<ref name="Jovanovic_2004_92"/> Chilton asked Bell to work with him as a duo modeled on [[Simon & Garfunkel]]; Bell declined, but invited Chilton to a performance by his own band, Icewater,<ref name="jovanovic pp76-89" /> comprising Bell, drummer Jody Stephens, and bassist Andy Hummel. Attracted by Icewater's music, Chilton showed the three his new song "Watch The Sunrise", and was asked to join the band.<ref name="jovanovic pp76-89" /> Both "Watch the Sunrise" and "Thirteen" were subsequently included on Big Star's first album, ''[[Number 1 Record|#1&nbsp;Record]]''. The now four-piece band adopted the name Big Star when one member was given the idea from a grocery store often visited for snacks during recording sessions.<ref name="Jovanovic_2004_94-101">Jovanovic, 94, 101</ref> One of many [[Big Star Markets]] outlets in the Memphis region at the time, it had a logo consisting of a five-pointed star enclosing the words "Big Star"; as well as the store's name, the band used its logo but without the word "Star" to avoid infringing copyright.<ref name="Jovanovic_2004_94-101" />

Although all four members contributed to songwriting and vocals on the first album, Chilton and Bell dominated as a duo intentionally modeled on [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]].<ref name="jovanovic pp99-100" /><ref name="All Music Guide to Rock p98">Bogdanov et al., 98</ref> The album was recorded by Ardent founder [[John Fry (record producer)|John Fry]], with [[Terry Manning]] contributing occasional backing vocals and keyboards. The title ''#1&nbsp;Record'' was decided towards the end of the recording sessions and evinced, albeit as a playful hope rather than a serious expectation, the chart position to be achieved by a big star.<ref name="jovanovic pp99-100" /> Although Fry&mdash;at the band's insistence&mdash;was credited as "executive producer", publicly he insisted that "the band themselves really produced these records".<ref name="jovanovic pp99-100">Jovanovic, 99<U+2013>100</ref> Fry recalled how Ardent, one of the first recording studios to use a sixteen-track tape machine, worked experimentally with the band members: "We started recording the songs with the intent that if it turned out OK we'd put it out [...] I wound up being the one that primarily worked on it: I recorded all the tracks and then they would often come late at night and do overdubs. One by one, they all learned enough engineering."<ref name="jovanovic pp76-89" />

{{Listen|filename=The Ballad of el Goodo.ogg|title="The Ballad of el Goodo"|description=Sample of "The Ballad of el Goodo" from ''#1&nbsp;Record'' (1972). The song is an example of a "luminous, melancholy ballad", contrasting with the rock and power pop that also pervade ''#1&nbsp;Record'' and ''Radio City''.}}
Describing the mix of musical styles present on ''#1 Record'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Bud Scoppa notes that the album includes "reflective and acoustic" numbers, saying that "even the prettiest tunes have tension and subtle energy to them, and the rockers reverberate with power". Scoppa finds that in each mode, "the guitar sound is sharp-edged and full".<ref name="RSalbumreview_firstandsecond">[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bigstar/albums/album/137805/review/6213042/no_1_recordradio_city ''Rolling Stone'' album reviews: ''#1 Record'' and ''Radio City'']. Rollingstone.com. Accessed July 19, 2009.</ref>''#1&nbsp;Record'' was released in June 1972, and quickly received strong reviews. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' went as far as to say, "Every cut could be a single". ''Rolling Stone'' judged the album "exceptionally good", while ''[[Cash Box|Cashbox]]'' stated, "This album is one of those red-letter days when everything falls together as a total sound", and called it "an important record that should go to the top with proper handling".<ref>Jovanovic, 107</ref> Proper handling, however, was not forthcoming: [[Stax Records]] proved unable to either promote or distribute the record with any degree of success, and even when the band's own efforts to get airplay generated interest, fans were unable to buy it as Stax could not make it available in many stores.<ref>Simmonds, Jeremy. ''The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars''. Chicago Review Press, 2008. 115. ISBN 978-1556527548</ref> Stax, in an effort to improve its catalog's availability, signed a deal with [[Columbia Records]], already successful distributors in the U.S., making Columbia responsible for the entire Stax catalog. But Columbia had no interest in dealing with the independent distributors previously used by Stax and removed even the existing copies of ''#1 Record'' from the stores.<ref>Segalstad, Eric. ''The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock & Roll''. Samadhi Creations, 2009. 186. ISBN 978-0615189642</ref>

===''Radio City''===
The frustration at ''#1 Record''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members:<ref name="jovanovic pp114-18">Jovanovic, 114<U+2013>118</ref> Bell, after being punched in the face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall.<ref name="jovanovic pp114-18" /> Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver.<ref name="jovanovic pp114-18" /> In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car.<ref name="jovanovic pp114-18" /> In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more,<ref name="jovanovic pp114-18" /> and by the end of the year Big Star disbanded.<ref name="jovanovic pp114-18" />

{{Listen|filename=September_Gurls.ogg|title="September Gurls"|description=Sample of "September Gurls" from ''Radio City (1974). Like '#1&nbsp;Record'', the album contains a mix of rock, power pop and acoustic reflection, but is more pop-oriented than either ''#1&nbsp;Record'' or ''Third''. This song is an example of the band's power pop at its best.}}
After a few months Chilton, Stephens and Hummel decided to reform Big Star, and the three resumed work on the second album.<ref name="jovanovic pp126-30">Jovanovic, 126<U+2013>30</ref> The title chosen, ''[[Radio City (album)|Radio City]]'', continued the play on the theme of a big star's popularity and success, expressing what Gordon calls the band's "romantic expectation".<ref name="gordon p234">Gordon, 234</ref> As Hummell put it,
{{blockquote|This was probably pretty lame, but in those days putting any word in front of the noun "city" to sort of emphasize the totality and pervasiveness of it was just a way of talking people had. If someone suggested going to a store but you had gotten a bad deal there you might say, "Oh no, that place is 'rip off city'." Calling an LP ''Radio City'' would be kind of wishful thinking. I mean we hoped it would be played on the radio a lot, making it "radio city". Of course it didn't pan out that way...<ref>Eaton, 102</ref>}} 
Stephens recalled: "''Radio City'', for me, was just an amazing record. Being a three-piece really opened things up for me in terms of playing drums. Drums take on a different role in a three-piece band, so it was a lot of fun. [...] ''Radio City'' was really more spontaneous, and the performances were pretty close to live performances."<ref name="jovanovic pp126-30" />

Although uncredited, Bell contributed to the writing of some of the album's songs, including "O My Soul" and "Back of a Car".<ref name="jovanovic pp126-30" /> Shortly before the album's release, Hummel left the band: judging that it would not last, and in his final year at college, he elected to concentrate on his studies and live a more normal life.<ref>Jovanovic, 138</ref>

''Rolling Stone''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Ken Barnes, describing the musical style of ''Radio City'', opens by noting as a backdrop that the band's debut, ''#1&nbsp;Record'', established it as "one of the leading new American bands working in the mid-Sixties pop and rock vein". ''Radio City'', Barnes finds, has "plenty of shimmering pop delights", although "the opening tune, 'O My Soul,' is a foreboding, sprawling funk affair"; Barnes concludes that "Sometimes they sound like the Byrds, sometimes like the early Who, but usually like their own indescribable selves".<ref name="RSalbumreview_firstandsecond" /> ''Radio City'' was released in January 1974 and, like ''#1&nbsp;Record'', received excellent reviews. ''[[Record World]]'' reported, "The sound is stimulating, the musicianship superb, and the result is tight and rollickingly rhythmic."<ref name="secondfailure">Jovanovic, 140</ref> ''Billboard'' judged it "a highly commercial set".<ref name="secondfailure" /> ''Rolling Stone''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Bud Scoppa, then with ''Phonograph Record'', affirmed, "Alex Chilton has now emerged as a major talent, and he'll be heard from again".<ref name="secondfailure" /> ''Cashbox'' called it "a collection of excellent material that hopefully will break this deserving band in a big way".<ref name="secondfailure" />  But just as ''#1&nbsp;Record'' had fallen victim to poor marketing, so too did ''Radio City''. Columbia, now in complete control of the Stax catalog, refused to process it following a disagreement. Without a distributor, sales of ''Radio City'', though far greater than those of ''#1&nbsp;Record'', were minimal at only around 20,000 copies.<ref name="secondfailure" />

===''Third/Sister Lovers''===
In September 1974, eight months after the release of ''Radio City'', the two remaining members of Big Star returned to Ardent Studios to work on a third album.<ref name="thirdstart">Jovanovic, 150<U+2013>160</ref> Chilton and Stephens were assisted by producer [[Jim Dickinson]] and an assortment of musicians including drummer Richard Rosebrough,<ref name="thirdstart" /> and Lesa Aldridge, Chilton's girlfriend, who contributed on vocals.<ref name="thirdstart" /> The sessions and mixing were completed in early 1975,<ref>Strong, Martin. ''The Great Rock Discography''. Canongate U.S., 2004. 185. ISBN 978-1841956152</ref> and 250 copies of the album were pressed with plain labels for promotional use.<ref name="jovanovic pp161-65">Jovanovic, 161<U+2013>165</ref> 

Parke Putterbaugh of ''Rolling Stone'' described ''[[Third/Sister Lovers]]'' as "extraordinary". It is, he wrote, "Chilton's untidy masterpiece. [...] beautiful and disturbing"; "vehemently original";  of "haunting brilliance":
<blockquote>To listen to it is to be "plunged into a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Songs are drenched in strings and sweet sentiment one minute, starkly played and downcast the next. No pop song has ever bottomed out more than "Holocaust", an anguished plaint sung at a snail's pace over discordant slide-guitar fragments and moaning cello [...] On the up side, there's the delicious pop minuet "Stroke It Noel," the anticipatory magic of "Nightime" ("Caught a glance in your eyes and fell through the skies," Chilton rhapsodizes) [...] Big Star's baroque, guitar-driven pop reaches its apotheosis on songs like "Kizza Me," "Thank You Friends" and "O'Dana". [...] Without question, ''Third'' is one of the most idiosyncratic, deeply felt and fully realized albums in the pop idiom.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bigstar/albums/album/94386/review/5942849/third_sister_lovers ''Rolling Stone'' album reviews: ''Third/Sister Lovers''].

{{Listen|filename=Holocaust.ogg|title="Holocaust"|description=Sample of "Holocaust" from ''Third/Sister Lovers'' (recorded 1974; released 1978).

Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional copies and met employees of a number of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album.<ref name="jovanovic pp161-65" /> When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release.<ref name="jovanovic pp161-65" /> Fry recalled, "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy".<ref name="jovanovic pp161-65" /> In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end.<ref name="jovanovic pp161-65" /> Dickinson later said that he was "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star ''Third'', but I think it is important that the artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill.<ref>Burgess, Richard James. ''The art of music production''. Omnibus Press, 2002. 114. ISBN 978-0711990104</ref>

Since quitting the band in 1972, Bell had spent time in several different countries trying to develop his solo career.<ref name="jovanovic pp161-65" /> In 1978, after his return to Memphis, the first two Big Star albums were released together in the UK as a double album, drawing enthusiastic reviews and interest from fans.<ref name="78releases">Jovanovic, 205<U+2013>207</ref> Soon afterwards Big Star's recognition grew further when, four years after its completion, the third album too was released in both the U.S. and the UK.<ref name="78releases" /> By now, the hitherto untitled ''Third/Sister Lovers'' had become known by several unofficial names including ''Third'' (reflecting its position in the discography), ''Beale Street Green'' (acknowledging the legendary site nearby, once a focal point for Memphis [[Blues (music)|blues]] musicians) and ''Sister Lovers'' (because during the album's recording sessions, Chilton and Stephens were dating sisters Lesa and Holliday Aldridge).<ref name="gordon p234" /><ref>Jovanovic, 148</ref>

Not long after the release of ''Third/Sister Lovers'', Bell died in a car accident.<ref name="belldeath">Jovanovic, 211</ref> He apparently lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before.<ref name="belldeath" /> A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins.<ref name="belldeath" /> Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.<ref name="belldeath" />

==Second era: 1993 to present==
Big Star returned in 1993 with a new line-up when guitarist [[Jon Auer]] and bassist [[Ken Stringfellow]] joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remain members of [[The Posies]], founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Minus 5]]. First-era material dominates Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album ''[[In Space]]''; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, "We were working out the set list and we went to this little cafe. Little did I know we'd be playing that set for the next ten years".<ref name="jovanovic pp253-60" /> The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 [[University of Missouri]] spring music festival.<ref name="columbia"/> A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as ''Columbia: Live at Missouri University''.<ref name="jovanovic pp253-60" /> The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan,<ref name="jovanovic pp253-60" /> as well as an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.<ref name="rollingstone">[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bigstar/biography Big Star Biography].

''In Space'' was released on 27 September 2005 on the [[Rykodisc]] label. Recorded during 2004, the album consists of new material mostly co-written by all four current members. Reviewing ''In Space'', ''Rolling Stone''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s David Fricke first points out the context for its release: "a world expecting that American Beatles ideal all over again" from a band that "achieved its power-pop perfection when no one else was looking".<ref name="fricke">[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bigstar/albums/album/7568280/review/7645165/in_space ''In Space'' review]. Rollingstone.com. Accessed July 18, 2009.</ref> In Fricke's estimation, the seemingly unrealistic expectation is in part met: "It's here&mdash;in the jangly longing and ice-wall harmonies of 'Lady Sweet'"; Fricke finds though that such songs are interleaved with "the eccentric R&B and demo-quality glam rock that have made Chilton's solo records a mixed blessing", and that "'A Whole New Thing' starts out like old [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]], then goes nowhere special".<ref name="fricke" /> Warming nevertheless to "the rough sunshine" of "Best Chance",  Fricke says in conclusion: "''In Space'' is no ''#1 Record'', but at its brightest, it is Big Star in every way".<ref name="fricke" />

The band appeared at San Francisco's [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] on 20 October 2007.

==Musical style and influences==

Bell took up guitar when twelve or thirteen, but only on hearing the first [[The Beatles|Beatles]] records was he motivated to play the instrument regularly.<ref name="jovanovic pp13-20">Jovanovic, 13<U+2013>20</ref> He acted as lead and rhythm guitarist and vocalist for a sequence of bands, performing songs by The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Zombies]] and [[The Animals]].<ref name="jovanovic pp13-20" /> Chilton's first awareness of music came at the age of six when his brother repeatedly played a record by [[The Coasters]].<ref name="jovanovic p28">Jovanovic, 28</ref> His father's liking for [[jazz]] then exposed him over the next few years to the music of [[Glenn Miller]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Dave Brubeck]].<ref name="jovanovic p28" /> Chilton's enthusiasm for music took hold when at age thirteen he first heard Beatles records; he recalled having known of 1950s rock and roll but "by 1959 Elvis was syrup and Jerry Lee was pretty much gone, and the rockabilly thing was sort of over so I didn't get really caught up in the rock scene until the Beatles came along".<ref>Gordon, 156</ref>

His face and neck are slightly reddened from his exertion. While drumming, he is singing into the microphone mounted close to his face]]
Chilton took up electric guitar at thirteen, playing along with Beatles songs, later saying, "I really loved the mid-sixties British pop music [...] all two and a half minutes or three minutes long, really appealing songs. So I've always aspired to that same format, that's what I like. Not to mention the rhythm and blues and the Stax stuff, too".<ref name="jovanovic p30">Jovanovic, 30</ref> Chilton abandoned his guitar-playing when with [[The Box Tops]], then took up the instrument again; he met [[Roger McGuinn]], guitarist for [[The Byrds]], and developed particular interest in electric guitar and acoustic [[folk (music)|folk]].<ref>Jovanovic, 78<U+2013>86</ref> Stephens enjoyed the music of [[Otis Redding]], [[The Isley Brothers]], [[The Who]], The Kinks and, in particular, The Beatles.<ref name="jovanovic pp13-20" /> He first played drums at home with his brother, then with a handful of bands in the years before Big Star formed.<ref name="jovanovic pp13-20" /> Hummel likewise was a member of more than one band during his early musical years, again influenced by The Beatles and other British Invasion acts.<ref name="jovanovic pp13-20" /> The bassist also played acoustic guitar for personal enjoyment, following the styles of [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] and using finger-picking techniques to play [[folk (music)|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]].<ref name="jovanovic pp13-20" /> Most songs on the first three albums are credited to either Bell/Chilton or Chilton, but some credit Hummel, Stephens and others, as either writer or co-writer. At the only seven live performances in the original era, the last of which took place before the second album's release, all four members contributed vocally.<ref name="jovanovic xvi">Jovanovic, xvi</ref>

While primarily inspired by the music of The Beatles and other [[British Invasion]] bands, acknowledging too the [[jangle pop]] and [[power pop]] of the period, Big Star also incorporated dark, nihilistic themes to produce a striking blend of musical and lyrical styles.<ref>Jovanovic, xvi, 155, 160</ref><ref>Derogatis, Jim.

Bogdanov et al., commenting on ''#1&nbsp;Record'' in their ''All Music Guide to Rock'', perceive in "The Ballad of El Goodo" a "luminous, melancholy ballad",<ref name="All Music Guide to Rock p98" /> whereas John Borack's ''Ultimate Power Pop Guide'' singles out ''Radio City''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "September Gurls" as a "glorious, glittering jewel" of power pop.<ref name="Borack p38" /> Borack notes too that ''Third/Sister Lovers'' is "slower, darker and a good deal weirder" than the first two albums, identifying "Holocaust" as "Alex Chilton at his haunting best", yet finds "Thank You Friends" exemplifying "left-field gems" also present in which "the hooks are every bit as undeniable" as before.<ref>Borack, 191</ref> Jovanovic writes that when recording what Peter Buckley in his ''Rough Guide to Rock'' terms the "snarling guitar rock"<ref>Buckley, 100</ref> of the first album's "Don't Lie To Me", the band, deeming conventional instruments inadequate for the task, wheeled two [[Norton Commando]] motorcycles into the studio and gunned the engines to intensify the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].<ref>Jovanovic, 93</ref> Bogdanov et al. reserve "snarl" for a ''Radio City'' song, "Mod Lang";<ref name="All Music Guide to Rock p98" /> here Buckley writes that "the power of the performance and the erratic mix gave a sense of chaos which only added to the thrill".<ref name="Buckley 101">Buckley, 101</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
Although Big Star's first era came to an end in 1974, the band acquired a cult following in the 1980s when new acts began to acknowledge the early material's significance.<ref>Shuker, Roy. ''Popular Music: The Key Concepts''. Routledge, 2005. 208. ISBN 978-0415347693</ref> [[R.E.M.]]'s Peter Buck admitted, "We've sort of flirted with greatness, but we've yet to make a record as good as ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]'' or ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' or ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' or Big Star's ''Third''. I don't know what it'll take to push us on to that level, but I think we've got it in us."<ref>Jovanovic, 247</ref> Chilton, however, told an interviewer in 1992, "I'm constantly surprised that people fall for Big Star the way they do... People say Big Star made some of the best rock 'n roll albums ever.  And I say they're wrong."<ref>Mojo Magazine, November 2009, pg. 46, interview with Martin Aston</ref>

Today, critics cite Big Star's first three albums as a profound influence on subsequent musicians. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' notes that Big Star "created a seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations of rockers, from the power-pop revivalists of the late 1970s to alternative rockers at the end of the century to the indie rock nation in the new millennium".<ref name="rollingstone" /> Jason Ankeny, music critic for Allmusic, identifies Big Star as "one of the most mythic and influential [[cult following|cult acts]] in all of rock & roll", whose "impact on subsequent generations of indie bands on both sides of the Atlantic is surpassed only by that of the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]]".<ref name="ankeny" /> Ankeny describes Big Star's second album, ''Radio City'', as "their masterpiece<U+2014>ragged and raw guitar-pop infused with remarkable intensity and spontaneity".<ref name="ankeny" />

In 1992, [[Rykodisc]] generated further interest in the band when it [[reissue]]d ''Third/Sister Lovers'' and released a posthumous compilation of Bell's solo material, ''I Am The Cosmos''.<ref name="Borack p13"/> In his 2007 book ''Shake Some Action: The Ultimate Power Pop Guide'', John Borack ranks the ''#1&nbsp;Record''/''Radio City'' double album at #2 in his chart "The 200 Greatest Power Pop Albums".<ref name="Borack p38">Borack, 38</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' includes ''#1 Record'', ''Radio City'' and ''Third/Sister Lovers'' in ''[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]''<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6626683/403_radio_city ''Radio City'' in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine<U+2019>s ''500 Greatest Albums of All Time''] Rollingstone.com.
