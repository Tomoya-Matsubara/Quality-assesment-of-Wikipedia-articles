'''Frome''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>fru<U+02D0>m|En-uk-Frome.ogg}}) is a [[town]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in northeast [[Somerset]], England. Located at the eastern end of the [[Mendip Hills]], the town is built on uneven high ground, and centres around the [[River Frome, Somerset|River Frome]]. The town is approximately {{convert|13|mi|km|0|lk=on}} south of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], {{convert|43|mi|km|0|lk=on}} east of the [[county town]], [[Taunton]] and {{convert|88|mi|km|0|lk=on}} west of [[London]]. In the 2001 census, the population was given as 24,510. The town is in the [[Mendip]] district of [[Somerset]] and is part of the [[Constituency#United Kingdom|parliamentary constituency]] of [[Somerton and Frome (UK Parliament constituency)|Somerton and Frome]].

In April 2010 a large [[Frome Hoard|hoard]] of third-century [[Roman coin]]s was unearthed in a field near the town. From AD 950 to 1650, Frome was larger than Bath and originally grew due to the [[wool]] and [[cloth]] industry. It later diversified into metal-working and printing, although these have declined. The town grew substantially in the 20th century but still retains a very large number of [[listed buildings]], and most of the centre falls within a [[conservation area]]. 

The town has road and rail transport links and acts as an economic centre for the surrounding area. It also provides a centre for cultural and sporting activities, including the annual [[Frome Festival]] and [[Frome Museum]]. A number of notable individuals were born in, or have lived in, the town.

== History ==
The name Frome comes from the [[Old English]] word ''ffraw'' meaning fair, fine or brisk and describing the flow of the river.<ref name="belham"/>

There is some limited evidence for Roman settlement of the area. The remains of a [[Roman villa|villa]] were found in the village of [[Whatley, Mendip|Whatley]], 3 miles to the west of Frome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=28414|title=Whatley Combe Villa| publisher=Somerset Historic Environment Record|date=26 January 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>

In April 2010, the [[Frome Hoard]], one of the largest-ever hoards of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] coins discovered in Britain, was found by a metal detectorist. The hoard of 52,500 coins dated from the third century AD and was found buried in a field near the town, in a jar {{convert|14|in|cm}} below the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10546960.stm|title=Huge Roman coin find for hobbyist|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> The coins were excavated by archaeologists from the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]],<ref>{{cite web | url= http://finds.org.uk/blogs/fromehoard/ | title= The Frome Hoard | date= 8 July 2010 | first= Anna | last= Booth | publisher= [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] | accessdate= 8 July 2010}}</ref> and some are now on display in the [[British Museum]]. The find will be the subject of a BBC TV programme ''Digging for Britain'' in August 2010.

A monastery built by St. [[Aldhelm]] in 685 is the earliest evidence of [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] occupation of Frome.<ref name="belham"/> The Saxon kings appear to have used Frome as a base from which to hunt in [[Selwood Forest]] and in 934 a ''[[witenagemot]]'' was held there, indicating that Frome must already have been a significant settlement.<ref name="gathercole">{{cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_FromeText.pdf |title=Frome|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey|year=2003|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref>

At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]], the manor was owned by [[William I of England|King William]], and was the principal settlement of the largest and wealthiest [[hundred (administrative division)|hundred]] in Somerset. Over the following years, parts of the original manor were spun off as distinct manors; for example, one was owned by the [[Minster (church)|minster]], later passing to the [[Abbey House, Cirencester|Abbey at Cirencester]], which others were leased by the Crown to important families. By the 13th century, the Abbey had bought up some of the other manors (although it did let them out again) and was exploiting the profits from market and trade in the town.<ref name="gathercole"/> Local tradition asserts that Frome was a medieval borough, and the reeve of Frome is occasionally mentioned in documents after the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], but there is no direct evidence that Frome was a borough and no trace of any charter granted to it. However, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] did grant a charter to Edmund Leversedge, then [[lord of the manor]], giving him the right to hold fairs on July 22 and September 21.<ref name="gathercole"/>

[[Image:Former Dye-House Frome.jpg|alt=Circular stone building with slate roof.|thumb|left|Former Dye-House, now the Tourist Information Centre]]
The manufacture of woollen cloth was established as the town's principal industry in the 15th century,<ref name="gathercole"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.breathe.com/djsteward/history.html|title=History of Frome Town|publisher=Frome Town|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> and Frome remained the only Somerset town in which this staple industry flourished.<ref name="belham"/> Families of clothiers gradually came to be the principal landowners in the town, with the manor of Frome itself finally passing into the ownership of a cloth merchant in 1714. From 1665 to 1725 major expansion, including the building of a new artisans' suburb to the west of Trinity Street, occurred.<ref name="havinden">{{cite book|last=Havinden|first=Michael|title=The Somerset Landscape|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|series=The making of the English landscape|pages=215|isbn=0340201169}}</ref> [[Daniel Defoe]] remarked that the town had:

{{quote|"so prodigiously increased within these last 20-30 years, that they have built a new church, and so many new streets of houses, and those houses are so full of inhabitants, that Frome is now reckoned to have more people in it than the city of Bath, and some say, than even Salisbury itself, and if their trade continues to increase for a few years more&nbsp;... it is likely to be one of the greatest and wealthiest towns in England"|Daniel Defoe|1720s}}

On the 27 June 1685, the forces of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]] camped in Frome, following their defeat in a skirmish with the Kings forces at [[Norton St Philip]]. Large numbers of his army deserted during the few days he stayed in the town before his eventual defeat at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]].<ref name="belham"/> Following the putting down of the [[Monmouth Rebellion]], 12 men were hanged in the town.<ref name="lambert">{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/frome.html|title=A brief history of Frome|last=Lambert|first=Tim|publisher=Local histories.org|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref>

Poverty, the decline of the wool industry in the mid-18th century, increased industrialisation, and rising food prices led to some unrest amongst the inhabitants of Frome, and there were riots during the century. By 1791, the town was described in less flattering terms than those Defoe had used 70 years earlier.<ref name="gathercole"/> In the early 19th century, plans were developed to reinvigorate the town and once again elevate it to its former position as a more important town than Bath. These plans, the idea of a local businessman, Thomas Bunn, mostly failed to come to fruition, although some public buildings were erected and a wide new approach road to the town centre from the south was cut (named Bath Street after the landowner, Lord Bath of [[Longleat]] House).<ref name="Goodall">{{cite book|last=Goodall|first=Rodney|title=The buildings of Frome, 2nd Ed|publisher=Frome society for local study| location=Frome| pages=149| isbn=0951015753}}</ref>

Whilst wool remained an important part of the town's economy into the 19th (and even 20th) centuries, other industries were established in the town. A bell-foundry started in 1684 by William Cockey grew to be a major producer of components for the developing [[natural gas|gas]] industry and employer of 800 people. The J W Singer brass foundry and bronze-casting works,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer1.htm|title=JW Singer & Sons|publisher=Frome  Museum|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> was a major employer and produced bronze statues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwsinger.com/|title=J W Singer website}}</ref> John Webb Singer was born in Frome and established his art metal work foundry in 1851. They made brass ornaments for local churches and became known through the [[Oxford Movement]] within the [[Church of England]] which lead to increasing demand for church ornaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer2.htm|title=The Founder|publisher=Frome Museum|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> In addition to church ornaments the firm developed the facilities and expertise to create large statues. One of the first statues cast was a copy of [[General Gordon]] riding a camel. The firm was also responsible for the bronze statue of [[Boudica]] with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with [[scythed chariot|scythes]] after the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] fashion), which  was commissioned by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] and executed by [[Thomas Thornycroft]]. It was not cast in [[bronze]] until 1902, 17 years after Thornycrofts death, and now stands next to [[Westminster Bridge]] and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]], London.<ref name=dnb>Mark Stocker, <U+2018>Thornycroft, Thomas (1815<U+2013>1885)<U+2019>, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Sept 2004 online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27369], accessed 2 January 2009</ref> The statue of [[Lady Justice]] on the dome above the [[Old Bailey]] was executed by the British sculptor, [[F. W. Pomeroy]] and cast by Singers.  She holds a sword in her right hand and a pair of weighing scales in her left.  The statue is popularly supposed to show [[Blind justice (concept)|blind Justice]]; however, the figure is not blindfolded. The statue of [[Alfred the Great]] at [[Winchester]] was a further commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer3.htm|title=Statuary|publisher=Frome Museum|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> The statues from Singers have also been exported around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer6.htm|title=List of Singers Statues|publisher=Frome Museum|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> Printing was another major industry, with the Butler and Tanner printworks being set up in the middle of the century. [[Brewing]] was also a source of employment.<ref name="Goodall"/>

During the 20th century the old wool industry in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Robin|title=Somerset: The complete Guide|publisher=Dovecote Press|location=Wimborne|pages=101<U+2013>104|isbn=187433627X}}</ref> As a result the population fell and in the 1930s it was slightly smaller than it had been in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued,<ref name="lambert"/> many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after [[World War II]], including the construction of [[council houses]].<ref name="belham"/>

Frome is the largest town within the Somerset [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Mendip]], although the administrative centre is [[Shepton Mallet]]. Prior to 1974 it was administered by Frome Urban District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10025394&c_id=10001043|title=A Vision of Britain Through Time : Frome Urban District}}</ref>

The town elects three members to [[Somerset County Council]], each from a separate county division. At the last election in June 2009, [[Liberal Democrats]] were elected in Frome South and Frome Selwood, and a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] in Frome North.<ref>[http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/council/councillors.asp Councillors] at Somerset County Council web site</ref> Frome also has eleven councillors on [[Mendip|Mendip District Council]], two from each of the town council wards except for Oakfield, which elects only one. Following elections in 2008, all eleven were Liberal Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/council/councillors.asp?cat=-1|title=Mendip District Council Councillors}}</ref>

The civil parish of Frome has adopted the style of a town, and there is a [[Town Council#United Kingdom|Town Council]] of 17 members. Councillors are split between six wards: three each for the Berkley Down, College, Keyford, Market and Park Wards, and two for the Oakfield Ward. The most recent elections were in May 2007, following which the council is made up of 10 Liberal Democrats, five [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], one member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and one [[independent (politician)|independent]] councillor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frome-tc.gov.uk|title=Frome Town Council |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> Frome has two twin towns: [[Ch<U+00E2>teau-Gontier]], [[France]] and [[Murrhardt]], [[Germany]].

The town was not represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] until given one member in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]]. Separate representation was abolished for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]], with Frome itself being transferred to the [[Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Wells]] division, whilst most of the remainder of the constituency formed the bulk of the new [[North Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|Somerset North]] constituency. Further changes took place for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] when the current [[Somerton and Frome (UK Parliament constituency)|Somerton and Frome]] constituency was created. The current representative is [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[David Heath (politician)|David Heath]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], although the seat has been contested by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. During the general election of 2010, in which 74% of those eligible turned out to vote, David Heath achieved a relatively slim majority of 1,817 votes (3% of the total),<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e07.stm |title=Somerton and Frome |publisher=BBC |accessdate=10 November 2010}} </ref> Frome is within the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England European Parliamentary constituency]] which elects six [[Members of the European Parliament|MEPs]] using the [[d'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation]].

The town has a new [[National Health Service]] community hospital, operated by Somerset [[Primary Care Trust]], located on the site of the former Showground at Fromefield.<ref>[http://www.somersetpct.nhs.uk/community/our-services2/community-hospitals/frome-community-hospital/ Frome Community Hospital], Somerset PCT</ref> The new hospital was opened in 2008, replacing the former Frome Victoria Hospital in Park Road which had been in use since 1901. The nearest [[Hospital#General|general hospital]] is the [[Royal United Hospital]] in Bath.

== Geography ==

The town rests on [[Forest Marble]] which dates back to the [[Middle Jurassic]],<ref name="middlejurassicdistribution">Weishampel, David B; et al. (2004). "Dinosaur distribution (Middle Jurassic, Europe)." In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm<U+00F3>lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 538<U+2013>541. ISBN 0-520-24209-2.</ref> and has been used for local building. The area surrounding the town is [[Cornbrash]], [[Oxford Clay]] and [[Greensand]].<ref name="belham">{{cite book|last=Belham|first=Peter|title=The Making of Frome|publisher=Frome society for local study|year=1985|edition=2}}</ref>

Frome is unevenly built on high ground above the River Frome, which is crossed by the 16th century town bridge in the town centre. The town centre is approximately {{convert|65|m|ft|0|lk=on}} above sea-level, whilst the outer parts of the town are between {{convert|90|m|ft|0|lk=on}} and {{convert|135|m|ft|0|lk=on}} above sea-level.<ref name="map">Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale map, grid reference ST775475</ref>

The main areas of the town are (approximately clockwise from the north-west): Innox Hill, Welshmill, Packsaddle, Fromefield, Stonebridge, Clink, Berkley Down, Easthill, Wallbridge, The Mount, Keyford and Lower Keyford, Marston Gate, The Butts, Critchill, Trinity, and Gould's Ground.<ref name="map"/>

Although the [[royal forest]] of Selwood no longer exists, the nearby countryside is still richly wooded, for example on the [[Longleat]], [[Maiden Bradley]] and [[Stourhead]] estates.

To the west of the town, on the edge of the Mendip Hills, there are large active [[limestone]] [[quarry|quarries]], such as [[Whatley Quarry]] and [[Merehead Quarry]], along with disused quarries. The working quarries are served by a [[Mendip Rail|dedicated railway line]] which branches off the main line at Frome, passes through the town centre and out through the Welshmill and Spring Gardens areas in the north-west quadrant of the town.

Along with the rest of [[Climate of south-west England|South West England]], Frome has a [[temperate|temperate climate]] which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (50&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) with [[seasonal]] and [[Diurnal motion|diurnal]] variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (34&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and 2&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (36&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (70&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the [[Azores High]] extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.<ref name="climate"/>

[[Cumulus cloud|Cloud]] often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] tends to be associated with [[Atlantic]] [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower [[cloud]]s and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and [[thunderstorms]] at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800<U+2013>900&nbsp;mm (31<U+2013>35&nbsp;in). About 8<U+2013>15 days of [[snowfall]] is typical. November to March have the highest mean [[wind]] speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.<ref name="climate">{{cite web | title=About south-west England | publisher=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/index.html | accessdate=2006-05-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060507201830/http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/index.html |archivedate = May 7, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

[[Image:Gentle St Frome2.JPG|alt=Two storey houses behind wall|thumb|Argyll House, Gentle Street (Grade II* listed)]]
The population of Frome was 12,240 in the 1831 census, however it then declined to 11,057 in 1901 and remained between 11,000 and 12,000 until the 1970s. Since then, it has expanded considerably, reaching over 23,000 in 1991.<ref name="gathercole"/> In the 2001 census, the population was 24,510, comprising 11,863 (48.4%) males and 12,647 (51.6%) females. 7,674 (31.3%) residents were aged 16 or below, 13,150 (63.3%) between 16 and 65, and 3,686 (15.0%) aged 65 or over.<ref name="popn"/>

In the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] of the population aged between 16 and 74, 11,580 (67%) were in employment, with only 513 (3%) unemployed (the remainder being economically inactive). About 68% of those in employment were in service industries, with the remainder in manufacturing. 4,323 people were employed in managerial or professional occupations, 1,362 were self-employed, and 4,635 in routine and semi-routine occupations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=799081&c=Frome&d=16&e=9&g=482856&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1266139438255&enc=1&dsFamilyId=783|title=Parish Profile - Work and Qualifications|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office of National Statistics|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> 10,198 households were recorded in the town, of which 7,679 (75%) were owner-occupied, 981 (10%) rented from private landlords, and 1,538 (15%) rented from the local authority or other social landlord.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=799081&c=Frome&d=16&e=7&g=482856&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1266139645707&enc=1&dsFamilyId=787|title=Parish Profile - Accommodation and Tenure|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office of Neighbourhood Statistics|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> 10,122 (99.3%) heads of households were white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=799081&c=Frome&d=16&g=482856&i=1001x1003x1006&k=Ethnic&m=0&r=1&s=1266139956689&enc=1&domainId=15&dsFamilyId=785|title=Parish Profile - Households|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office of National Statistics|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:Market Place Frome.JPG|alt=Street scene with cars between buildings|left|thumb||Market Place]]
The metal-working and printing industries which replaced wool as Frome's main industry have declined but not left the town. Singers still has a presence in the town, as does Butler and Tanner, although the latter (now named Butler Tanner and Dennis following a take-over) hit major financial difficulties in 2008, and made two-thirds of its workforce redundant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7369195.stm|title=Hundreds of print staff lose jobs|date=2008-04-26|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7648015.stm|title=Fund to help out ex-print workers|date=2008-10-02|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref>

Almost half of the economically active population of Frome commute to work outside the town (in Bath, [[Bristol]], [[Warminster]], [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]] or further afield).

Frome town centre contains a considerable number of independent shops, and a few chain stores. Retail is primarily aimed at serving the local population's requirements for food (there are two large supermarkets on opposite edges of the town, and three smaller supermarkets in the town centre), basic clothing, health and beauty, [[DIY]] and some electrical goods. However studies show that only about a quarter of the town's population do their non-food shopping in the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vision4frome.org.uk/documents/V4F-baseline-2008.pdf|title=Vision for Frome Baseline Study|year=2008|publisher=2MD Regeneration,|pages=39|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref> [[Bank]]s and [[building society|building societies]] have branches in the town centre.<ref name="timetoplan"/><ref name="vision"/>

Frome is served by two newspapers, the ''[[Somerset Guardian Standard|Frome & Somerset Standard]]'' and the ''[[Frome Times]]''.

In 2008, a 'not for profit' company called Frome Community Productions was formed by members of the community in order to develop and deliver FromeFM, an internet based community radio station. The station broadcasts 24 hours per day and is completely staffed by volunteers who produce features, interviews and music shows.

== Landmarks ==
The older parts of Frome <U+2013> for example, around Sheppard's Barton and Catherine Hill <U+2013> are picturesque, containing an outstanding collection of late 17th and 18th century small houses.<ref name="gathercole"/> The Trinity area, which was built in the latter half of the 17th century and first half of the 18th century, is a fine (and rare) example of early industrial housing. Over 300 houses were built between 1660 and 1756 in a very unusual early example of a planned grid-pattern. Although about half the area was demolished in the 1960s under a [[Slum]] Clearance Order, before its historical importance was realised, the remainder was saved and was restored at a cost of <U+00A3>4 million between 1980 and 1984.<ref name="Goodall"/> Also in this area is the elaborate former Selwood Printing Works.

[[Image:Catherine Hill Frome.jpg|alt=Street scene looking down a narrow cobbled road with stone shops and houses on either side.|thumb|left|Catherine Hill]]
Stoney Street, which leads into Catherine Hill, is a steep, cobbled road climbing out of the town centre. Also in the centre of the town, Cheap Street contains buildings dating to the 16th and 17th centuries, and has a stream running down the middle, fed by the spring at St John's Church. Cheap Street has never been used for vehicular traffic and its layout is based on land plots dating to approximately 1500. Despite a fire in 1923, the buildings have remained substantially unchanged since 1830, apart from shop-frontages.<ref name="Goodall"/>

The town bridge, which was originally built in the 14th century, was rebuilt in the 16th century and widened in the 18th century, at which time houses were built on it (making it one of the few bridges in the country to support buildings, the others being [[Pulteney Bridge]] in Bath, and one in Lincoln).<ref name="gathercole"/><ref name="Goodall"/>

The Tourist Information Centre in Justice Lane is contained within a circular dye-house, known to have been in existence by 1813, one of two surviving in the town (the other is in Willow Vale). It was restored in 1994.<ref name="gathercole"/><ref name="Goodall"/>

In the 1990s and first few years of the 21st century, Frome benefited from considerable investment in the restoration of its historic buildings through the [[English Heritage]] Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme and the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] Townscape Heritage Initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Documents/Regeneration/frome%20blt%20lowres.pdf|title=Historic Building Repair in Frome|publisher=Mendip District Council|pages=7|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>

Frome has over 500 listed buildings, three of which (including the parish church) are grade I listed.

=== Grade I Listed Buildings ===
[[Image:Blue House Frome.jpg|alt=Yellow stone building with central 2 storey block with arched windows, hipped roof and clock tower|thumb|right|[[The Blue House, Frome|The Blue House]], a grade I listed building]]
[[The Blue House, Frome|The Blue House]], located adjacent to the town bridge, is a Grade I [[listed building]] and was formerly the Bluecoat School and Almshouses, so named due to the colour of the school uniforms. Built in 1726 at a cost of <U+00A3>1,401 8''s'' 9''d'', it replaced a previous [[almshouse]] dating from 1461 and rebuilt in 1621. The Blue House provided a home for twenty widow women and schooling for twenty boys. The front of the building is adorned by two statues, one of a man and the other a woman, indicating the building's dual purpose. They are colloquially known as "Billy Ball" and "Nancy Guy". The building's role as a school came to an end in 1921, and it now provides studio and one-bedroom flats for seventeen elderly residents.<ref name="gathercole"/><ref name="Goodall"/><ref>{{cite web | title=The Blue House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=266245 | accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

[[Rook Lane Chapel]] was a [[Nonconformism|noncomformist]] chapel built between 1705 and 1707 by James Pope. The chapel had a gallery around three sides, and the centre of the ceiling was domed and supported by two [[tuscan column]]s. Rook Lane ceased to be used as a chapel in 1968 and there followed twenty-five years of neglect. In the early 1990s the building was [[compulsory purchase|compulsorily purchased]] by [[Somerset County Council]] and transferred to the [[Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust]] who carried out repairs and restorations. In 2001 it was converted by a firm of architects, the ground floor becoming a community hall and arts centre, managed by Rook Lane Arts Trust, and the galleried upper floor becoming offices for the architectural firm, NVB Architects.<ref name="Goodall"/><ref>''Rook Lane Chapel 1707-2007: a short history'' (2007).

=== Tunnels ===
Frome is reputed to have one or more systems of tunnels beneath the streets of the older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example, in the wall at the top of Stoney Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remains unknown, but they have been under investigation in recent years by at least one local group and a documentary has been made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frometunnels.co.uk/|title=Introduction|publisher=Frome Tunnels Project|accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref>

== Religious sites ==
=== Anglican churches ===
[[Image:St John the Baptist, Frome.jpg|alt=View through an archway of end of a church with a central door flanked by canopied niches containing statues. Arched window above the door and spire behind.|thumb|right|[[Church of St John the Baptist, Frome]]]]
The [[Church of St John the Baptist, Frome|parish church of St John the Baptist]], was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century replacing a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] building that had stood since 685. The building was in very poor condition by the mid-19th century, and major restoration work <U+2013> almost a complete rebuilding <U+2013> was carried out in the 1860s, at a cost of almost <U+00A3>40,000. One of the more unusual pieces of work carried out was the construction of the ''Via Crucis'', which is thought to be unique in an Anglican church. Another unusual feature are the carved roundels above the nave arcades depicting parables and miracles, which were added later in the century.<ref name="Goodall"/><ref>{{cite web | title=Parish Church of St John the Baptist | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=266035 | accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> Outside the east end of the church is the tomb of Bishop [[Thomas Ken]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Tomb of Bishop Ken | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=266037 | accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref> The tower has eight bells, which bear inscriptions indicating that they were cast at various points between 1622 and 1792.<ref>Belham, Peter (1987). ''Guide to the Church of St John the Baptist, Frome Selwood''. St John's Parish Church Council.</ref>

A daughter church of St John's, Christ Church, was built in 1818 by [[George Allen Underwood]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266139|title=Christ Church|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> although considerable changes were made throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name="Goodall"/>

The third Anglican Church, Holy Trinity, was built in 1837-38 by [[Henry Goodridge]] in the style of Commissioners' Gothic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266325|title=Holy Trinity|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> It is unusual in that the altar is at the west end due to the position in which the church was built. The stained glass windows are near-contemporary copies of windows designed by Sir [[Edward Burne-Jones]].<ref name="Goodall"/>

Finally, St Mary's at Innox Hill was built in 1863, by C.E. Giles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266191|title=Church of St Mary|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> as another Chapel of Ease to St John's. It is small with a decorated sanctuary ceiling.<ref name="Goodall"/>

=== Irvingite ===
In 1853, [[Irvingite]] Catholics (Catholic-Apostolic) began worshiping in a building in the West End until the church was closed.

=== Roman Catholic ===
The [[Roman Catholic]] church began in Frome after the building of a temporary church in Park Road in 1928, and a new church, St Catharine's Catholic Church, was finally built on the site in 1967 and 1968.

=== Non-conformist churches ===
[[Image:Rook Lane Chapel Frome1.JPG|alt=Two storey symmetrical building with two tiers of seven windows. Leading up is a driveway with grass and shrubs on either side.|left|thumb|Rook Lane Chapel]]
As well as Rook Lane Chapel, there were other non-conformist religious houses in Frome. In 1773, a split in the congregation of Rook Lane led to the establishment of another Zion Congregational Church in Whittox Lane. This building was replaced in 1810, and was extended in 1888 (a separate, octagonal school room with a conical roof having been built on the grounds in 1875).<ref name="Goodall"/>

A [[Quaker]] Meeting House existed in Sheppards Barton, now South Parade, from 1675 to 1856. The original building was replaced around 1730 with a simple unadorned stone building comprising a single meeting room with wrought iron gallery above. The building became a school, the town library, Red Cross centre and, since 1999, the offices of a software company. The present chapel-like appearance was created in a 1993 refurbishment by the Red Cross.

[[Baptists]] had also been worshiping in the town since 1669, and had two churches. One was built in Sheppards Barton (now South Parade) in 1708. This was demolished and replaced by a new building in 1850, which was itself closed in 2001. Part of this building was converted to residential use but the main church, with a baptism pool, remains disused. A second Baptist Church was built in Badcox Lane (now Catherine Street) in 1711. It was replaced with a new building in 1813, which was embellished with a [[Doric order|Doric]] portico in 1845.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266101|title=Badcox Chapel|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> It closed in 1962 (later serving as a library, before being converted into flats in the 1980s).<ref name="Goodall"/>

The [[Methodist]]s built themselves a church in 1812 at Gorehedge, which is still in use (after considerable additions in 1863, restoration in 1871 and major internal rearrangement in the 1980s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266356|title=Wesleyan Methodist Church|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref> Sun Street Chapel was erected by the [[Primitive Methodist]]s in 1834, and closed in 1982, although it is now being used by another religious group. There is another Methodist church on Portway, built in 1910.<ref name="Goodall"/>

Finally, there is a Dissenters' Cemetery with Chapel at Vallis Road, which was founded in 1851 by Frome's 'Free Churches', mainly Baptist, Congregational and Methodist and has been the site of over 6,000 burials.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/3877159.stm|title=Historic cemetery site restored|date=2004-07-10|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>

== Transport ==
[[Image:Sheppards Barton Frome1.JPG|alt=Narrow street between stone houses|thumb|Sheppards Barton]]
Frome is served by the [[Heart of Wessex Line|Bristol to Weymouth railway line]] which passes the eastern edge of the town. [[Frome railway station|Frome station]] was opened in 1850 and is one of the oldest railway stations still in operation in Britain, now with direct services to London Paddington <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=266286|title=Frome Railway Station|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref> Trains are operated by [[First Great Western]]. A freight line, which branches off through the town to serve the quarries on the Mendip Hills, is mainly used by [[Mendip Rail]]. A continuation of this line, which previously linked Frome to [[Radstock]], is now the route of [[NCR 24|National Cycle Route 24]], otherwise known as the Colliers Way.

Frome is served by a by-pass road, the [[A361 road|A361]], which passes around the southern and eastern edges of the town, while the [[A362 road|A362]] passes through the centre of the town from north-west to south-east.
