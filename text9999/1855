'''Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia''' ('''VAIN''') is a condition that describes [[Premalignant condition|premalignant]] [[histological]] findings in the [[vagina]] characterized by [[Dysplasia|dysplastic]] changes.<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=1192 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> It is generally [[asymptomatic]]. 

The disorder is rare and may have no symptoms.<ref name=Diakomanolis>Diakomanolis E, Stefanidis K, Rodolakis A, Haidopoulos D, Sindos M, Chatzipappas I, Michalas S. Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia: report of 102 cases. ''European Journal of Gynaecological Oncology''. '''23'''(5):457-459. PMID 12440826.</ref> VAIN can be detected by the presence of abnormal cells in a [[Pap test|Papanicolaou test]] (Pap smear).<ref name=Diakomanolis/>

Like [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]], VAIN comes in three stages, VAIN 1, 2, and 3.<ref name=cancerresearch/> In VAIN 1, a third of the thickness of the cells in the vaginal skin are abnormal, while in VAIN 3, the full thickness is affected.<ref name=cancerresearch/>  VAIN 3 is also known as [[carcinoma in-situ]], or stage 0 [[vaginal cancer]].<ref name=cancerresearch>Cancer Research UK (2002).

Infection with certain, high-risk types of the [[human papillomavirus]] may be associated with up to 80% of cases of VAIN.<ref>Cancer Research UK (2002). [http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=8699 Risks and causes of vaginal cancer]. CancerHelp UK. Retrieved January 3, 2008.</ref>

One study found that most cases of VAIN were located in the upper third of the vagina, and were multifocal.<ref name=Dodge>Dodge JA, Eltabbakh GH, Mount SL, Walker RP, Morgan A (2001). Clinical features and risk of recurrence among patients with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. ''Gynecologic Oncology''. '''83'''(2):363-369. PMID 11606098. Retrieved January 3, 2008.</ref> In the same study, 65 and 10% patients with VAIN also had [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] and [[vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia]], respectively.<ref name=Dodge/>

In another study, most cases of VAIN went into remission after a single treatment, but about 5% of the cases studied progressed into a more serious condition despite treatment.<ref>Sillman FH, Fruchter RG, Chen YS, Camilien L, Sedlis A, McTigue E (1997).
