'''Mark Anthony Tildesley''' (31 August 1976 - 1 June 1984) was an [[English people|English]] schoolboy who disappeared on 1 June 1984, when he was seven-years-old, whilst visiting a fair in his home town of [[Wokingham]] in [[Berkshire]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Paedophile in jail rape allegation|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|location=Glasgow|date=7 January 2002|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23496163.html|accessdate=16 April 2015}} {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}</ref> 

In 1990 it emerged that, on the night he disappeared, Tildesley had been abducted, drugged, tortured, raped and murdered by a [[London]]-based [[homosexual]] paedophile gang, led by [[Sidney Cooke]]. Another man named Leslie Bailey was charged with manslaughter in 1991 and was given two [[life sentence]]s in 1992. He was murdered himself in prison in 1993.

Tildesley's body has never been found and the murder is Wokingham's most notorious unsolved crime. [[Thames Valley Police]] believe that his body is buried within a mile of Wellington Road in the town, the location of the fair from which he was abducted.

==Background==
===Half-term holiday===
On Friday 25 May 1984, the Palmer C of E Junior School (now [http://www.thelifecloud.net/schools/AllSaintsCE%28Aided%29PrimarySchoolWokingham All Saints CE (Aided) Primary School]) in Norreys Avenue had broken up for its summer half-term holiday. One of its Year 3 pupils was seven-year-old Mark Tildesley.<ref name=autogenerate10>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/brave-mum-dies-without-finding-4218567 Brave mum dies without finding murdered son Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

The Frank Ayers Funfair, which came to a field off Wellington Road in Wokingham four times a year (now the site of the Carnival Leisure Park swimming pool, fitness centre and bowling alley which opened in 1992), had come again during that holiday week.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-can-they-call-this-justice-9-3-98/ How can they call this justice? (9.3.98)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Mark was desperate to go but he did not have enough money to do so. Mark<U+2019>s pocket money was only 30p a week, so he supplemented this that week by putting trolleys from [[Tesco]] in Denmark Street (now an [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] and a Cleaver restaurant) back to where they belonged, thus collecting their customers' abandoned 10p deposits.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-can-they-call-this-justice-9-3-98/ How can they call this justice? (9.3.98)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Going to The Frank Ayers Funfair===
At the end of the week, on the afternoon of Friday 1 June 1984, Mark had met a stooping old man outside the Candy Shop in the town centre who gave him some sweets for 50p (which had just been bought from the sweet shop by that man). The man said that he was going to the fair later that day and that he would pay for Mark to go on the dodgems that evening.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-can-they-call-this-justice-9-3-98/ How can they call this justice?

After eating dinner, at around 5:30pm, Mark left his home in Rose Court off Rose Street on his most treasured possession, a second-hand gold [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] [[Raleigh Chopper|Tomahawk]] bike, to make the half-a-mile journey to the fair. He promised to be back home by 7:30pm, saying ''"Don't worry mum, I won't be late"''. On his way to the fair, he met with two of his friends who were in the town at the time. However, they wanted to go back home first and then go to the fair later so Mark decided to go to the fair alone immediately. This was the last time anyone who knew Mark well saw him alive.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-can-they-call-this-justice-9-3-98/ How can they call this justice?

===Reported missing===
At 7:30pm, the time at which Mark had promised to return home, he had still not arrived. At 8pm, his parents went down to the fair to find him. However, all they could find was his bike chained to railings near to the entrance of the field where the fair was being held.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-can-they-call-this-justice-9-3-98/ How can they call this justice? (9.3.98)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Shortly after Mark<U+2019>s disappearance, several witnesses reported seeing a boy which fitted Mark<U+2019>s description being dragged away forcefully against his will towards a car in nearby Langborough Road (where the current Wokingham Library which opened in 1996 now stands) by a stooping old man between 7pm and 8pm that evening.<ref name=autogenerated3>[https://spotlightonabuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mirror231092.jpg Death at the fair (23.10.92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Thames Valley Police search===
Despite a massive police search, including those of nearby streams, no trace of Mark was ever discovered.<ref name=autogenerated7>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf4rwBq0a0g TILDESLEY,Mark<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A train driver reported seeing a fox carrying what looked like a child<U+2019>s arm in its mouth, but nothing was found.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-can-they-call-this-justice-9-3-98/ How can they call this justice? (9.3.98)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

By October 1984, with little new leads to go on, [[Thames Valley Police]] started to wind down their investigation into Mark<U+2019>s disappearance.<ref name=autogenerate10>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/brave-mum-dies-without-finding-4218567 Brave mum dies without finding murdered son Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Just over half-a-year later, on 13 June 1985, a reconstruction of Mark<U+2019>s last known moments was aired on the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Crimewatch]]''. This brought a huge public response, but little concrete evidence emerged.<ref name=autogenerate10>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/brave-mum-dies-without-finding-4218567 Brave mum dies without finding murdered son Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Two years after this, on 29 April 1987, it emerged that there had been a number of attempted abductions of young boys over the past six months in the Wokingham area. The police investigated whether these could be linked to Mark<U+2019>s disappearance, but this was eventually dismissed.<ref name=autogenerated7>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf4rwBq0a0g TILDESLEY,Mark<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Subsequent events==
===Metropolitan Police interview suspect===
Three-and-a-half years later, in December 1990, the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] were interviewing a convicted East London-based homosexual paedophile gang member called Leslie Bailey, who had already been charged with two other murders, that of 14-year-old Jason Swift and six-year-old Barry Lewis, both of which occurred after Mark<U+2019>s disappearance.<ref name="indy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/paedophile-gets-life-for-killing-boy-7-at-orgy-homosexual-ring-abducted-children-and-drugged-them-for-group-sex-1559081.html|title=Paedophile gets life for killing boy, 7, at orgy: Homosexual ring abducted children and drugged them for group sex |work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=23 October 1992|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated6>[https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/operation-orchid-aug-89-oct-92-draft/ Operation Orchid (Aug <U+2019>89 <U+2013> Oct <U+2019>92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
 
The police had obtained a hand written paper map and a hand written paper letter which had been given by Bailey to a fellow inmate at [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth Prison]]. The map showed where Mark had been killed, and the letter, which had been written by a cell-mate, was addressed to another gang member called [[Sidney Cooke]], who also knew about Mark<U+2019>s murder.<ref name="indy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/paedophile-gets-life-for-killing-boy-7-at-orgy-homosexual-ring-abducted-children-and-drugged-them-for-group-sex-1559081.html|title=Paedophile gets life for killing boy, 7, at orgy: Homosexual ring abducted children and drugged them for group sex |work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=23 October 1992|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated6>[https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/operation-orchid-aug-89-oct-92-draft/ Operation Orchid (Aug <U+2019>89 <U+2013> Oct <U+2019>92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

At this point, Bailey, who suffered from a mild learning disability which meant that he had limited understanding, confessed that his homosexual paedophile gang, whom the police had nicknamed the ''"Dirty Dozen"'', led by Cooke, from the Kingsmeade Estate in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], had abducted, drugged, tortured, raped and murdered Mark on the night he disappeared. It was at this point that the police realised that the stooping old man who had been frequently described in connection with Mark<U+2019>s disappearance was in fact Cooke. The three murders have since been referred to as ''<U+201C>Operation Orchid<U+201D>''.<ref name="indy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/paedophile-gets-life-for-killing-boy-7-at-orgy-homosexual-ring-abducted-children-and-drugged-them-for-group-sex-1559081.html|title=Paedophile gets life for killing boy, 7, at orgy: Homosexual ring abducted children and drugged them for group sex |work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=23 October 1992|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated6>[https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/operation-orchid-aug-89-oct-92-draft/ Operation Orchid (Aug <U+2019>89 <U+2013> Oct <U+2019>92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==="Mark's party"===
On the night of Mark<U+2019>s disappearance, Bailey had been asked by another member of the gang, his lover Lennie Smith, to drive him from London to Wokingham, as there would be a party (of child sex abuse) in a caravan owned by Cooke located near to a fair.<ref name=autogenerated3>[https://spotlightonabuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mirror231092.jpg Death at the fair (23.10.92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Bailey and Smith then met Cooke and Mark at Bailey's white [[Triumph 2000]] car in Langborough Road, near to the fairground. With Bailey driving, Smith was in the front passenger seat, whilst Cooke was holding Mark back in the rear of the car. They then met a fourth man, Robert Oliver, at Cooke's blue and white caravan, which had lace curtains. This was located a short drive away past the relocated Tesco in Finchampstead Road (which had opened in 1998), on a field called ''"The Moors"'' on Evendons Lane, which is located in between the [[Finchampstead]] and [[Barkham]] areas of Wokingham.<ref name=autogenerated3>[https://spotlightonabuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mirror231092.jpg Death at the fair (23.10.92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After Cooke gave Mark a glass of milk laced with [[muscle relaxant]], of which he only drank half of it as he said it ''"taste's funny"'', the four men practised non-consensual anal intercourse with Mark, starting with Cooke and ending with Smith. After more muscle relaxant was applied directly down Mark's throat, the gang rape started again. Smith then forced a tablet into Mark's mouth before grabbing him by the throat. The party, which was named ''<U+201C>Mark<U+2019>s party<U+201D>'' by Bailey, had already lasted for half an hour and Bailey stated he knew at this point that Mark was dead as he could not feel a pulse, but that Cooke had told him that he was fine and that he would take the boy home. This meant that it was likely that Mark was already dead before his parents even knew that he was missing.<ref name=indy1/>

After the party, Bailey drove Smith back to Hackney, arriving there after midnight. Before Bailey dropped Smith off at marshes, Smith said to Bailey that he would leave what to do with Mark's body up to Cooke.<ref name=autogenerated3>[https://spotlightonabuse.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mirror231092.jpg Death at the fair (23.10.92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Charged with manslaughter===
Bailey was charged with manslaughter in connection with Mark<U+2019>s murder on 18 October 1991 and was given two life sentences a year later. The other three men have never admitted playing any role in the murder of Mark, despite a tiger keyring identical to the one owned by Mark being found in Cooke's repossessed dark coloured [[Jaguar XJ]] car in 1985, a year after Mark's disappearance.<ref name="indy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/paedophile-gets-life-for-killing-boy-7-at-orgy-homosexual-ring-abducted-children-and-drugged-them-for-group-sex-1559081.html|title=Paedophile gets life for killing boy, 7, at orgy: Homosexual ring abducted children and drugged them for group sex |work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=23 October 1992|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated6>[https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/operation-orchid-aug-89-oct-92-draft/ Operation Orchid (Aug <U+2019>89 <U+2013> Oct <U+2019>92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated10>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEXT+STOP+HELL%3B+EXCLUSIVE+Worst+paedophile+in+Britain+dies+of+AIDS+in...-a0147708938 NEXT STOP HELL; EXCLUSIVE Worst paedophile in Britain dies of AIDS in jail's secret wing.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
 
No charges were therefore brought against the other three men as the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] felt that Bailey<U+2019>s confession was insufficient evidence for their cases to result in successful convictions.<ref name=autogenerated6>[https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/operation-orchid-aug-89-oct-92-draft/ Operation Orchid (Aug <U+2019>89 <U+2013> Oct <U+2019>92)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In addition, the Crown Prosecution Service also declined to prosecute Cooke for Mark's murder as he was already in prison for the manslaughter of Jason Swift.<ref>{{cite news|date=5 October 1999|title=Victims snared at funfairs|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/465986.stm|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref>

On 7 October 1993 Bailey himself was murdered in [[HM Prison Whitemoor|Whitemoor Prison]] in [[Cambridgeshire]]. The death was welcomed by Mark<U+2019>s parents. Mr Tildesley said he would like to shake the murderer<U+2019>s hand, whilst Mrs Tildesley opened a bottle of wine to celebrate. It later emerged that Bailey was murdered by two other inmates.<ref name=indy1/><ref name=autogenerated9>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/panorama/transcripts/transcript_11_05_98.txt Panorama Defend the Children TX 11.05.98<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Smith has since died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] in a secret unit in [[HM Prison Nottingham|Nottingham Prison]] in 2006.<ref name=autogenerated10>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NEXT+STOP+HELL%3B+EXCLUSIVE+Worst+paedophile+in+Britain+dies+of+AIDS+in...-a0147708938 NEXT STOP HELL; EXCLUSIVE Worst paedophile in Britain dies of AIDS in jail's secret wing.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerate9>[https://theneedleblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/operations-stranger-and-orchid-lennie-smith/ Operations Stranger and Orchid: Lennie Smith<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Unfinished investigation===
The police received a ''"Judge's Commendation"'' for ''"pursuing an honourable and sustained investigation"'' which led to the eventual solving of the events of Mark<U+2019>s case. However, the police admitted in public that the case had not been finished as Mark<U+2019>s body had not been found.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

Mark<U+2019>s parents kept his bedroom exactly how it was the day he went missing, until Mrs Tildesley moved to nearby Langley Common Road in Barkham (further away than Evendons Lane), shortly after Mr Tildesley<U+2019>s death in 2006.<ref name=autogenerate10>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/brave-mum-dies-without-finding-4218567 Brave mum dies without finding murdered son Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Public memorial==
Shortly after Mark<U+2019>s disappearance, a public memorial, that of a jade coloured bench, was erected exactly at the very spot where Mark was last seen alive by the general public. This can be seen directly to the right of the entrance to the Carnival Leisure Park on Wellington Road in Wokingham. A name plate on a plank of wood at the top of the bench reads ''<U+201C>In Memory of MARK TILDESLEY<U+201D>''.<ref name=autogenerated9>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/panorama/transcripts/transcript_11_05_98.txt Panorama Defend the Children TX 11.05.98<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

When Mrs Tildesley passed away in 2011, a second name plate was put on the bench, with her name on it, on the plank of wood directly beneath the one with Mark<U+2019>s name plate on, in remembrance of her.<ref name=autogenerated11>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/final-tribute-murdered-schoolboy-mark-4217296 Final tribute to murdered schoolboy Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

==Recovery of body==
Mark<U+2019>s body has never been found.

Bailey claimed he did not know where Cooke had buried Mark's body.<ref name=autogenerated11>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/final-tribute-murdered-schoolboy-mark-4217296 Final tribute to murdered schoolboy Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Cooke has indicated he knows where Mark's body is buried, but refuses to tell the police, or the boy's family, the exact location.

Following the confession by Bailey of Mark's murder, the police dug up ''"The Moors"'' field in Evendons Lane in March 1991, but they did not find anything.<ref name=autogenerated12>[https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/police-dig-field-in-new-hunt-for-mark-19-03-91/ Police dig field in new hunt for Mark (19.03.91)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

A headstone was erected on 30 January 1993 at the Free Church Burial Ground on Reading Road in Wokingham in remembrance of him.<ref name=autogenerate10>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/brave-mum-dies-without-finding-4218567 Brave mum dies without finding murdered son Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In May 1998, the police refused to requestion Cooke in relation to Mark's murder, and to dig up a nearby golf course in search of him.<ref name=autogenerated13>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/95689.stm Cooke 'link' to unsolved death quashed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2008, Cooke's former lover and cell-mate, on-the-run convicted paedophile David Patrick, claimed to know where Cooke had buried Mark, which he would reveal for the sum of <U+00A3>3,000. Police later dismissed the claim as false, and simply trying to extort cash at the expense of Mark's mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/justice/1098083/Paedophile-Seven-year-old-victim-Demands-money-to-reveal-location-of-body.html#ixzz2JUXLFpiz|title=Perv cashes in on child murder|author=Nick Parker|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=28 April 2008|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, a fragment of human skull discovered near Evendons Lane was found not to be that of the missing schoolboy.<ref name=autogenerated15>[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/human-skull-found-wokingham-not-4203516 Human skull found in Wokingham is not Mark Tildesley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Thames Valley Police]] believe that Mark<U+2019>s body is buried within a mile of Wellington Road in Wokingham, which was the location of the fair from which Mark was abducted.
