'''''Symphonic Fantasies: Music from Square Enix''''' was an award winning symphonic tribute concert held in Cologne, Germany on the September 12, 2009 featuring [[video game music]] from Japanese game developer [[Square Enix]]. The concert featured symphonic movements based on the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, ''[[Secret of Mana]]'', the ''[[Chrono (series)|Chrono]]'' series, and the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. The concert was produced and directed by [[Thomas B<U+00F6>cker]], with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician [[Jonne Valtonen]] with assistance by Roger Wanamo. Due to overwhelming demand, a second concert was necessitated at the K<U+00F6>nig-Pilsener-Arena in [[Oberhausen]], on September 11, 2009. The concert was performed by The WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and the WDR Radio Choir Cologne under conduction from Arnie Roth, with guest performers [[Rony Barrak]] and [[Benyamin Nuss]] joining the orchestra. ''Symphonic Fantasies'' was broadcasted over radio on the WDR4 station and streamed live video online.

In 2012, 4 new performances were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both for the quality of the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.

==Concerts==
===Production===
[[Thomas B<U+00F6>cker]] and then [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]] director Winfried Fechner began collaborating on orchestrated video game concerts in 2007, after Fechner had attended the ''[[Symphonic Game Music Concerts|Fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert]]'' held in Leipzig.<ref name="SEMOfechnerint"/> As their ideas and plans materialized, three projects were set in motion to determine the interest of a younger audience in classical music performance and the aptitude of the WDR orchestra in focusing on a new source of compositions. The first project was ''PROMS: That's Sound, That's Rhythm'', held in early 2008, featuring a mixture of classical works and video game music, ranging from works by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and [[Morton Gould]] as well as arrangements of music from video games such as ''[[Shenmue]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'' previously featured in the ''Symphonic Game Music Concerts''. The second project, held in August 2008, was a composer specific concert titled ''[[Symphonic Shades - H<U+00FC>lsbeck in Concert]]'', focusing entirely on the works of German video game composer [[Chris H<U+00FC>lsbeck]].<ref name="semojan09"/> After the concert, Fechner revealed in an interview the existance of the third project, saying that he and B<U+00F6>cker would be involved in another concert of video game music the following September.<ref name="Fechner08int"/> The third project was to be a concert of music from one game company, focusing on multiple titles released by the same developer.<ref name="semojan09"/> This company was later confirmed to be [[Square Enix]] when Fechner announced ''Symphonic Fantasies'' as a video game music concert to take place on September 12, 2009. A website was set up for announcements, interviews and other concert information.<ref name="OffSiteApr09"/>

[[Image:Thomas_Boecker.jpg|thumb|150px|Producer [[Thomas B<U+00F6>cker]] in 2010]]
B<U+00F6>cker later explained that the decision to focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' from the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, ''[[Secret of Mana]]'', ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' from the ''[[Chrono (series)|Chrono]]'' series, and the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites.<ref name="semojan09"/> The composers were [[Yoko Shimomura]] for the [[music of Kingdom Hearts|music of ''Kingdom Hearts'']], [[Hiroki Kikuta]] for the [[music of the Mana series|music of ''Secret of Mana'']], [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] for the [[music of Chrono Trigger|music of ''Chrono Trigger'']] and [[music of Chrono Cross|''Cross'']], and [[Nobuo Uematsu]] for the [[music of the Final Fantasy series|music of the ''Final Fantasy'' series]].<ref name="OffSiteJul09"/>

[[Image:Jonne_Valtonen_Official.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Arranger [[Jonne Valtonen]] in 2010]]
For the concert, [[Jonne Valtonen]] returned as the lead arranger; he had previously been the arranger for video game music concerts since 2005, including ''Symphonic Shades''. He was given complete freedom to arrange the music based on the general outline given to him by B<U+00F6>cker. Valtonen spent six months on the arrangements, during which Valtonen studied each song and referred to the composer's original intended expression.<ref name="semojan09"/> No Japanese guest arrangers were used for this concert in order to maintain a unique European take on the source material, but Valtonen brought in former classmate and close friend Roger Wanamo to assist on the arrangement of the music from the ''Chrono'' games.<ref name="semojan09"/><ref name="semoWanamoint"/> This was Wanamo's first time arranging video game music.<ref name="semoWanamoint"/> On March 9, 2009 It was also announced that Valtonen had additionally been commissioned to compose an original fanfare to be played at the start of the concert, and with a video preview of his composition was released.<ref name="OffSiteApr09"/>

The arrangements in the concert were structured as suites, dubbed "Fantasies", with multiple songs from each game series positioned and arranged together to tell melodic stories rather than using the conventional medley structure more commonly heard in video game music arrangements.<ref name="SEMOreport"/> The fanfare, titled ''Fanfare Overture'', was done in a style of traditional fanfares with some accentuated textures in order to introduce all the elements of the orchestra. The ''Kingdom Hearts'' suite featured seven songs from the two titles, and was arranged as a romantic piano concerto.<ref name="SEMOreport"/><ref name="osvfantasies"/> ''Secret of Mana'' featured six songs featured in the original game.<ref name="SEMOreport"/> The arrangement made use of notable unique techniques in order to replicate the atmosphere found in the original game; for example, the choir was used to create "sound effects" such as floor vibration by foot stomping and simulating distant rain with their voices.<ref name="osvfantasies"/> The ''Chrono'' suite featured ten songs from ''Chrono Trigger'' and ''Chrono Cross''.<ref name="SEMOreport"/> The suite featured a "crossing" of melodies, in which multiple melodies would be layered on top of one another, resulting in different well-known themes performed simultaneously in harmony.<ref name="osvfantasies"/> The ''Final Fantasy'' suite contained eight songs from the first seven titles in the series. Unlike the other suites, it featured a simpler structure, focusing more on each individual theme rather than overlapping multiple pieces.<ref name="SEMOreport"/>

===Original performance===
[[Image:Symphonicfantasies.jpg|thumb|250px|''Symphonic Fantasies'' performers at the end of the September 12, 2009 concert]]
The orchestra received about two weeks of rehearsal time prior to their performances, more than any other game concert before.<ref name="SEMOdec09"/> The concert was originally scheduled to be performed on September 12, 2009 in the Cologne Philharmonic Hall in [[Cologne]], but once the tickets were sold out, a second performance was added for September 11, 2009 at the [[K<U+00F6>nig Pilsener Arena]] in [[Oberhausen]]. Ticket sales for the initial concert began on January 17, and half of them were sold within a week, with the remainder sold by April 2, 2009.<ref name="OffSiteApr09"/> The concert was preceded by a Meet and Greet session that included the original composers as well as the arrangement team and guest artists for the show. The concerts were performed by the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and WDR Radio Choir Cologne, conducted by [[Arnie Roth]].<ref name="OffSiteJul09"/>

Before each suite, the moderator would introduce the upcoming musical piece, as well as introduce the composer in attendance. Each "Fantasy" lasted for more than 15 minutes each. The ''Kingdom Hearts'' suite featured solo pianist [[Benyamin Nuss]]. For the ''Chrono'' suite, [[Rony Barrak]] joined the orchestra and performed on his signature [[darbuka]]. A surprise encore was performed after the final suite, which took the from of a medley of the final boss themes from each game. Rony Barrak returned on stage as a soloist for the encore.<ref name="osvfantasies"/> No video screens or other form of tools were used during the concert, with only minimal lighting effects at certain parts for atmosphere being employed. The event was broadcast live on the WDR4 radio station, as well as through an online video stream, enabling a worldwide audience to watch the concert.<ref name="SEMOreport"/>

===2012 performances===
Three years after the original performance, on September 14, 2011, during the [[Tokyo Game Show]], Square Enix Japan announced on their website that the ''Symphonic Fantasies'' concert would be performed in Tokyo on January 7 and 8, 2012. They also announced that Benyamin Nuss, Rony Barrak, Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo and Thomas B<U+00F6>cker would be in attendance. B<U+00F6>cker returned to produce the event, and Nuss and Barrak returned as soloists.<ref name="JapanAnnounce"/>

The concerts were held at the [[Tokyo Bunka Kaikan]] Main Hall, and were performed by the [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus. The concerts were conducted by Eckehard Stier. In addition to the originally announced attendees, in attendance were guest of honors Hiroki Kikuta, Yoko Shimomura, and Yasunori Mitsuda, as well as guests such as video game composers [[Takenobu Mitsuyoshi]], [[Masashi Hamauzu]], and [[Mahito Yokota]]. The concerts were featured extensively in the February issue of ''[[Famitsu]]'' as well as on their official website.<ref name="Famitsureport"/> ''Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo'' was the first all-European video game concert production to take place in Japan. More than 4000 fans were in attendance.<ref name="JPGreview"/> The arrangements and tempo were slightly modified from the original concert, and the encore was modified to add elements from an additional ''Final Fantasy'' song.<ref name="RPGFjapanreview"/><ref name="MAZjapan"/>

At the conclusion of the ''[[Symphonic Odysseys - Tribute to Nobuo Uematsu|Symphonic Odysseys]]'' concert in Cologne by Merregnon Studios on July 9, 2011, the WDR announced that ''Symphonic Fantasies'' would return to Germany in 2012.

==Reception==
The initial event received widespread critical acclaim, with much praise given to the focused presentation, deeply developed arrangements and evolution of the concept.
