==Education and early life==
Clovis Ethelbert Byers was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on [[5 November]] [[1899]]. He entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1916 and was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in 1920.<ref name="biog">{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996}}</ref>

Byers was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]] in 1925, and [[Captain]] in 1935. He served as a Student Officer at the [[United States Army Cavalry School]] from 1930 to 1931, and with the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry Regiment]] from 1931 to 1932. He was at the [[United States Military Academy]], first as a cadet company commander and then as Assistant Adjutant, from 1932 to 1934. From 1934 to 1936 he attended the [[Command and General Staff College]]. He was [[Aide-de-Camp]] to [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert J. Brees]], commander of the [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] area, from 1936 to 1937. Byers then joined the [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry]] at [[Fort Bliss]], where he commanded Troop A from 1937 to 1938 and the 1st Squadron from 1938 to 1939. He then attended the [[U.S. Army War College]] from 1939 to 1940 and was promoted to [[Major]] in 1940.<ref name="Arlington">[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/cebyers.htm Clovis Ethelbert Byers at Arlington Cemetery]</ref>

==World War II==
Byers served with G-1 (Personnel) Division, [[United States Department of War|War Department]] from 1940 to 1942, at a time when the workload of this division was particularly heavy owing to the vast expansion of the Army. He was promoted to wartime rank [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] in 1941 and [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in 1942.<ref name="Arlington" /> 

In 1942, Byers became Chief of Staff of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert L. Eichelberger]]'s [[77th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|77th Infantry Division]]. He followed Eichelberger when the latter became commander of [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]].<ref name="biog" /> Byers brought a number of staff members with him from the 77th Infantry Division.<ref>{{harvnb|Eichelberger|1950|p=86}}</ref> Byers was promoted to temporary [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] in October 1942.<ref name="Arlington" /> 

[[Image:MacNider, Waldron, and Byers.jpg|thumb|left|Brigadier Generals [[Hanford MacNider]], Albert Waldron, and Clovis Byers recuperate in hospital in Australia after being wounded in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]].]]
When the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]] started going badly, [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], the Supreme Commander, [[South West Pacific Area]], decided to send I Corps headquarters to New Guinea. Eichelberger recalled Macarthur's instructions: 
{{cquote|"Bob," he said, "I want you to take Buna, or not come back alive. " He paused for a moment and then, without looking at Byers, pointed a finger. "And that goes for your chief of staff, too."<ref>{{harvnb|Eichelberger|1950|p=21}}</ref>}}

In accordance with MacArthur's orders, Eichelberger relieved the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd Infantry Division]]'s commander, Major General [[Edwin F. Harding]], replacing him with the division's artillery commander, Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron, on [[2 December]] [[1942]].<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=211-212}}</ref> In an attack on [[5 December]], Waldron was shot in the [[shoulder]] by a Japanese [[sniper]],<ref>{{harvnb|Eichelberger|1950|p=29}}</ref> and Byers succeeded him as commander of the troops in the field.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|p=244}} Byers succeeded to command of the troops in the field, but not to command of the 32nd Infantry Division, since Brigadier General Frayne Baker, the division's rear echelon commander was a more senior officer.</ref> Byers in turn was wounded on [[16 December]]. He became the American third general to be shot at Buna, none of whom was more than 75 metres from Japanese lines at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Eichelberger|1950|p=41}}</ref> General Eichelberger assumed command, as he was now the only American general officer present. Waldron and Byers were awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross]].<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|p=259}}</ref> In turn, Byers recommended Eichelberger for the [[Medal of Honor]] but the nomination was disapproved by MacArthur.<ref>{{harvnb|Chwialkowski|1993|pp=74-75}}</ref>

Byers had plenty of time to recover, as I Corps would not be committed to operations again until [[Operations Reckless and Persecution]] in April 1944. Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, commander of the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] offered to make Byers an assistant division commander. When Byers refused the offer, Krueger took this as a personal affront.<ref>{{harvnb|Chwialkowski|1993|p=98}}</ref> 

At [[Battle of Lone Tree Hill (1944)|Lone Tree Hill]], Byers was nearly killed in a Japanese ambush but an unwitting group of signalmen sprung the trap instead. Byers continued with his mission to report on the state of affairs at the front.<ref>{{harvnb|Eichelberger|1950|pp=147-149}}</ref>

In August 1944, [[Eighth Army (United States)|Eighth Army]] headquarters arrived in the New Guinea and Eichelberger became commander of the new army.<ref>{{harvnb|Chwialkowski|1993|p=104}}</ref> Once again, Byers followed him as his chief of staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Eichelberger|1950|p=160}}</ref> Byers remained Chief of Staff through the Eighth Army's operations on [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], the [[Battle of the Visayas|Visayas]], and [[Battle of Mindanao|Mindanao]]. After hostilities ended, the Eighth Army participated in the [[Occupation of Japan]]. Eichelberger remained commander and Byers remained his Chief of Staff until Eichelberger retired in 1948.

== Korean War ==
On returning to the United States in 1948, Byers became commander of the [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]]. In 1949, he returned to [[Washington, DC]] as Deputy Assistant Army Chief of Staff G-1 (Personnel).<ref name="Arlington" />

In July 1951, Byers replaced Major General [[Edward Almond]] as commander of [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]], then engaged in combat in [[Korean War|Korea]]. As such, Byers was in overall command at the [[Battle of Heartbreak Ridge]] and the [[Battle of Bloody Ridge]].

==Later life==
Byers became commander of [[XVI Corps (United States)|XVI Corps]] in 1952. He served as Chief of Staff of Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) from 1952 to 1954 and then commander of X Corps again. He was Deputy Commandant of the [[National War College]] from 1954 to 1955 and then Commandant of the [[NATO Defence College]] from 1955 to 1957.<ref name="biog" />

Byers was promoted to the substantive rank of Brigadier General, United States Army in 1948, Major General in 1952, and Lieutenant General in 1955.<ref name="Arlington" />

Byers retired from the army in June 1959.<ref name="biog" /> He died on [[13 December]] [[1973]] and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. His papers are in the [[Hoover Institution]].
