[[Image:Migration map4.png|thumb|350px|right|Map of [[early human migrations]] according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]] ]] 

In [[paleoanthropology]], the '''recent African origin of modern humans''' is the mainstream model describing the origin and [[Early human migrations|early dispersal]] of anatomically modern humans, ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''. The theory popularly is called the ''(Recent) Out-of-Africa'' model, and academically the ''recent single-origin hypothesis'' (''RSOH''), ''Replacement Hypothesis'', and ''Recent African Origin'' (''RAO'') model. The hypothesis that humans had originated in Africa was published in [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Descent of Man]]'' (1871).  The concept was speculative until the 1980s, when it was corroborated by a study of present-day [[mitochondrial DNA]], combined with evidence based on [[physical anthropology]] of archaic [[specimens]].

According to both genetic and fossil evidence, [[archaic Homo sapiens]] evolved to [[anatomically modern humans]] solely in [[Africa]], between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, with members of one branch leaving Africa by 60,000 years ago and over time replacing earlier human populations such as [[Neanderthals]] and ''[[Homo erectus]]''. According to this theory, around the above time frame, one of the African [[Population genetics|subpopulations]] went through a process of [[speciation]], prohibiting [[gene flow]] between African and Eurasian Human populations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The recent single origin of modern humans in [[East Africa]] is the near-consensus position held within the scientific community.<ref>Hua Liu, et al. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/505436 A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History]. The American Journal of Human Genetics, volume 79 (2006), pages 230<U+2013>237, quote: ''Currently available genetic and archaeological evidence is generally interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin of modern humans in East Africa. However, this is where '''the near consensus''' on human settlement history ends, and considerable uncertainty clouds any more detailed aspect of human colonization history.''</ref>

The competing hypothesis is the [[multiregional origin of modern humans]].  Some push back the original "out of Africa" migration<U+2014>in this case, by ''[[Homo erectus]]'', not by ''[[Homo sapiens]]''<U+2014>to two million years ago.<ref>[http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/johanson.html Donald Johanson, "Origins of Modern Humans: Multiregional or Out of Africa?"], Action Bioscience.org </ref><ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/2002/aug/featafrica Joseph D'Agnese, "Not Out of Africa, Alan Thorne's challenging ideas about human evolution"], ''Discover'', Aug 2002</ref> A recently discovered fossilized mandible that is putatively a hybrid between ''Homo sapiens'' and an earlier hominid, that is likely to be 110,000 years old, may also challenge this hypothesis.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18093-chinese-challenge-to-out-of-africa-theory.html Phil McKenna, "Chinese challenge to 'out of Africa' theory"], ''New Scientist'', Nov 2009</ref>

==History of the theory==
The traditional biblical view was that humans had all descended from [[Adam and Eve]], but with the [[History of anthropology|development of anthropology]] in the early 19th century there was a vigorous dispute between the [[monogenism]] of those like [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] and [[James Cowles Pritchard]] who held that since the creation, the various [[Race (classification of human beings)|human races]] had developed as different varieties sharing descent, and the [[polygenism]] of their opponents such as [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Josiah C. Nott]] who held that human races had been created as separate species, or had developed as separate species through [[transmutation of species]] from apes, with no common ancestor. 

[[Charles Darwin]] was one of the first to propose [[common descent]] of living organisms, and among the first to suggest that all humans had in common ancestors who lived in Africa. In the ''[[Descent of Man]]'' he speculated that humans had descended from apes which still had small brains but walked upright, freeing their hands for use which favoured intelligence, and that these apes were African:<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=213}}</ref>
{{cquote|In each great region of the world the living [[mammals]] are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It is, therefore, probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]]; and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere. But it is useless to speculate on this subject, for an ape nearly as large as a man, namely the [[Dryopithecus]] of Lartet, which was closely allied to the anthropomorphous [[Hylobates]], existed in Europe during the [[Upper Miocene]] period; and since so remote a period the earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale.<ref>[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=212 The descent of man Chapter 6 - On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man]</ref>}}

The prediction was insightful because at the time, in 1871, there were hardly any human fossils of ancient hominids available. Almost fifty years later Darwin's speculation was supported when anthropologists began finding numerous fossils of ancient small brained hominids in several areas of Africa ([[list of hominina fossils]]).

The debate in [[anthropology]] had swung in favour of monogenism by the mid 20th century.  Isolated proponents of polygenism held forth in the mid-20th century, such as  [[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]], who hypothesized as late as 1962 that ''Homo sapiens'' arose five separate times from ''Homo erectus'' in five separate places.<ref> Jackson Jr., John P. (2001). ''[http://comm.colorado.edu/jjackson/research/coon.pdf "In Ways Unacademical": The Reception of Carleton S. Coon's ''The Origin of Races''], University of Colorado</ref> The "Recent African origin" of modern humans means "single origin" - monogenism - and has been used in various contexts as an antonym to polygenism .

With the advent of [[archaeogenetics]] in the 1990s, it became possible to date the "out of Africa" migration with some confidence until 2000, when the mtDNA sequence of ''[[Mungo Man]]'' was published.<ref>Mitochondrial DNA sequences in ancient Australians: Implications for modern human origins.

The question of whether there was inheritance of other typological (not ''de facto'') ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' subspecies into the ''Homo sapiens'' genetic pool remains under debate.

==Early Homo sapiens==
{{Main|Anatomically modern humans|Archaic Homo sapiens}}

''Archaic Homo sapiens'' originated in Africa about 250,000 years ago. The trend in [[Cranial capacity|cranial expansion]] and the [[acheulean]] elaboration of stone tool technologies which occurred between 400,000 years ago and the second interglacial period in the Middle [[Pleistocene]] (around 250,000 years ago) provide evidence for a transition from ''[[Homo erectus|H. erectus]]'' to ''H. sapiens''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In the RAO scenario, migration within and out of Africa eventually replaced the earlier dispersed ''H. erectus''.

==Genetic reconstruction==
{{See|Archaeogenetics|Early human migrations}}
Two pieces of the [[human genome]] are quite useful in deciphering human history: [[mitochondrial DNA]] and the [[Y chromosome]]. These are the only two parts of the genome that are not shuffled about by the evolutionary mechanisms that generate diversity with each generation: instead, these elements are passed down intact. According to the hypothesis, all 6.7 billion people alive today have inherited the same Mitochondria{{Citation needed|I think only few thousand pople get sequenced mtDNA, definietly no more than 100,000|this is numerical demagogy|date=June 2009}} from one woman who lived in Africa about 160,000 years ago;<ref>Cann, R.

All men today have inherited their Y chromosomes from a man who lived 60,000 years ago, probably in Africa. He has been named [[Y-chromosomal Adam]]. It is now believed that more men participated in the out of Africa exodus of early humans than women based on comparing non-sex-specific chromosomes with sex-specific ones.<ref>[http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/547619/?sc=rssn Ancient African Exodus Mostly Involved Men, Geneticists Find. Nature Genetics. Harvard Medical School.]</ref>

===Mitochondrial DNA===
{{See|Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup}}
[[Image:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|right|350px|One model of human migration based on Mitochondrial DNA]]

The first lineage to branch off from [[Mitochondrial Eve]] is [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]]. This haplogroup is found in high proportions among the [[san people|San]] of Southern Africa, the [[Sandawe]] of East Africa. It is also found among the [[Mbuti]] people.<ref>[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/3/757 Whole-mtDNA Genome Sequence Analysis of Ancient African Lineages]</ref><ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1288201 mtDNA Variation in the South African Kung and Khwe]</ref> These groups branched off early in human history and have remained relatively genetically isolated since then.[[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|Haplogroups L1]], [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]] are descendents of L0 and are largely confined to Africa. The macro haplogroups [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M]] and [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N]], which are the lineages of the rest of the world outside Africa, descend from L3.

===Y-chromosomal DNA===
{{Main|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups|Haplogroup CT (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)}}
The mutations defining macro-haplogroup [[Haplogroup CT (Y-DNA)|CT]] (all Y haplogroups except [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A]] and [[Haplogroup B (Y-DNA)|B]]) predate the "Out of Africa" migration, its descendent macro-group [[Haplogroup DE (Y-DNA)|DE]] being confined to Africa.  The  mutations that distinguish Haplogroup [[Haplogroup C (Y-DNA)|C]] from all other descendants of CR  have occurred some 60,000 years ago, shortly after the first Out of Africa migration.

[[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup F]] originated some 45,000 years ago, either in [[North Africa]] (in which case it would point to a second wave of out-of-Africa migration) or in [[South Asia]]. More than 90% of males not native to Africa are descended in direct male line from the first bearer of haplogroup F.

===Genomic analysis===

Although mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal DNA are particularly useful in deciphering human history, data on the genomes of dozens of population groups have also been studied. In June 2009, an analysis of [[genome]]-wide [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] data from the [[International HapMap Project]] (Phase II) and [[Center for the Study of Human Polymorphisms|CEPH]] Human Genome Diversity Panel samples was published.<ref name="coopg">{{cite journal |author=Coop G, Pickrell JK, Novembre J, Kudaravalli S, Li J, ''et al'' |title= The Role of Geography in Human Adaptation |journal=[[PLoS Genetics|PLoS Genet]] |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=1<U+2013>16 |year= 2009 |month= June |doi= 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000500 |url= http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000500}}</ref> Those samples were taken from 1138 unrelated individuals.<ref name="coopg"/> Before this analysis, [[population genetics|population geneticists]] expected to find dramatic differences among [[ethnic group]]s, with derived [[allele]]s shared among such groups but uncommon or nonexistent in other groups.<ref name="washpost09">{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/21/AR2009062101726_pf.html | title = Among Many Peoples, Little Genomic Variety | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = June 22, 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-25}}</ref> Instead the study of 53 populations taken from the HapMap and CEPH data revealed that the population groups studied fell into just three genetic groups: Africans, Eurasians (which includes natives of Europe and the Middle East, and Southwest Asians east to present-day Pakistan), and East Asians, which includes natives of Asia, Japan, Southeast Asia, the Americas, and Oceania.<ref name="washpost09"/> The study determined that most ethnic group differences can be attributed to [[genetic drift]], with modern African populations having greater genetic diversity than the other two genetic groups, and modern Eurasians somewhat more than modern East Asians.<ref name="washpost09"/> The study suggested that [[natural selection]] may shape the human genome much more slowly than previously thought, with factors such as migration within and among continents more heavily influencing the distribution of genetic variations.<ref>{{cite web| title= Geography And History Shape Genetic Differences In Humans | url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090605091157.htm | publisher=[[Science Daily]] | date= June 7, 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-25}}</ref>

==Exodus from Africa==
[[Image:Red Sea2.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Red Sea]] crossing]]
Some 70 millennia ago, a part of the  bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup  
[[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]]  migrated from [[East Africa]] into the [[Near East]].

Some scientists believe that only a few people left Africa in a single migration that went on to populate the rest of the world.<ref>[http://news.softpedia.com/news/Both-Aborigines-and-Europeans-Rooted-in-Africa-54225.shtml Both Australian Aborigines and Europeans Rooted in Africa]</ref> It has been estimated that from a population of 2,000 to 5,000 in Africa, only a small group of possibly 150 people crossed the Red Sea. This is because, of all the lineages present in Africa, only the daughters of one lineage, L3, are found outside Africa. Had there been several migrations one would expect more than one African lineage outside Africa. L3's daughters, the M and N lineages, are found in very low frequencies in Africa (although haplogroup M1 is very ancient and diversified in [[North Africa|North]] and [[Horn of Africa|Northeast Africa]]) and appear to be recent arrivals. A possible explanation is that these mutations occurred in East Africa shortly before the exodus and by the [[founder effect]] became the dominant haplogroups after the exodus from Africa. Alternatively, the mutations may have arisen shortly after the exodus from Africa.

Other scientists have proposed a Multiple Dispersal Model, in which there were two migrations out of Africa, one across the Red Sea travelling along the coastal regions to [[South Asia|India]] (the Coastal Route), which would be represented by Haplogroup M. Another group of migrants with Haplogroup N followed the Nile from East Africa, heading northwards and crossing into [[Asia]] through the [[Sinai]]. This group then branched in several directions, some moving into Europe and others heading east into Asia. This hypothesis attempts to explain why Haplogroup N is predominant in Europe and why Haplogroup M is absent in Europe. Evidence of the coastal migration is hypothesized to have been destroyed by the rise in sea levels during the [[Holocene]] epoch.<ref>[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/2/13/comments/comments A single origin, several dispersal hypothesis]</ref><ref>[http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/Projects/sdispersal/sdispersal.htm Searching for traces of the Southern Dispersal], by Dr. Marta Miraz<U+00F3>n Lahr, et al.</ref>  Alternatively, a small European founder population that initially expressed both Haplogroup M and N could have lost Haplogroup M through random genetic drift resulting from a [[Population bottleneck|bottleneck]] (i.e. a [[founder effect]]).

Today at the [[Bab-el-Mandeb straits]] the [[Red Sea]] is about 12 miles (20 kilometres) wide, but 50,000 years ago it was much narrower and sea levels were 70 meters lower. Though the straits were never completely closed, there may have been islands in between which could be reached using simple rafts. Shell [[middens]] 125,000 years old have been found in [[Eritrea]],<ref name="pmid10811218">{{cite journal |author=Walter RC, Buffler RT, Bruggemann JH, ''et al.'' |title=Early human occupation of the Red Sea coast of Eritrea during the last interglacial |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6782 |pages=65<U+2013>9 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10811218 |doi=10.1038/35011048 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35011048}}</ref> indicating the diet of early humans included seafood obtained by [[beachcombing]].

==Subsequent expansion==
{{Main|Early human migrations}}
From the Near East, these populations spread east to [[Paleolithic South Asia|South Asia]] by 50,000 years ago, and on to [[Prehistoric Australia|Australia]] by 40,000 years ago, ''Homo sapiens'' for the first time colonizing territory never reached by ''Homo erectus''. [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] was reached by [[Cro-Magnon]] some 40,000 years ago. East Asia ([[Prehistoric Korea|Korea]], [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan]]) was reached by 30,000 years ago. It is disputed whether subsequent [[Models of migration to the New World|migration to North America]] took place around 30,000 years ago, or only considerably later, around 14,000 years ago.

The group that crossed the Red Sea travelled along the coastal route around the coast of [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]] until reaching India, which appears to be the first major settling point. M is found in high frequencies along the southern coastal regions of [[Pakistan]] and India and it has the greatest diversity in India, indicating that it is here where the mutation may have occurred.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=516768#B3 Most of the extant mtDNA boundaries in South and Southwest Asia were likely shaped during the initial settlement of Eurasia by anatomically modern humans<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sixty percent of the Indian population belong to Haplogroup M. The indigenous people of the [[Andaman Islands]] also belong to the M lineage. The Andamanese are thought to be offshoots of some of the earliest inhabitants in Asia because of their long isolation from mainland Asia. They are evidence of the coastal route of early settlers that extends from India along the coasts of [[Thailand]] and Indonesia all the way to [[Papua New Guinea]]. Since M is found in high frequencies in highlanders from New Guinea as well, and both the Andamanese and New Guineans have dark skin and [[natural hair|Afro-textured hair]], some scientists believe they are all part of the same wave of migrants who departed across the Red Sea ~60,000 years ago in the [[Great Coastal Migration]].  Notably, the findings of Harding et al. (2000, p. 1355) show that, at least with regard to dark [[skin color]], the haplotype background of Papua New Guineans at [[MC1R]] (one of a number of genes involved in melanin production) is identical to that of Africans (barring a single silent mutation).  Thus, although these groups are distinct from Africans at other loci (due to drift, bottlenecks, etc), it is evident that selection for the dark [[skin color]] trait likely continued (at least at MC1R) following the exodus.  This would support the hypothesis that suggests that the original migrants from Africa resembled pre-exodus Africans (at least in skin color), and that the present day remnants of this ancient phenotype can be seen among contemporary Africans, Andamanese and New Guineans. Others suggest that their physical resemblance to Africans could be the result of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>[http://ehl.santafe.edu/ruhlen.htm Evolution of Human Languages<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=378623 genetic origins of the Andaman Islanders]</ref><ref>[http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/CB_2002_p1-18.pdf Genetic affinities of the Andaman Islanders]</ref>

From [[Arabia]] to India the proportion of haplogroup M increases eastwards: in eastern India, M outnumbers N by a ratio of 3:1. However, crossing over into East Asia, Haplogroup N reappears as the dominant lineage. M is predominant in South East Asia but amongst [[Indigenous Australians]] N reemerges as the more common lineage. This discontinuous distribution of Haplogroup N from Europe to Australia can be explained by [[founder effect]]s and [[population bottleneck]]s.<ref>[http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/13/7/1600 Mitochondrial Genome Variation and Evolutionary History of Australian and New Guinean Aborigines]</ref>

==Competing hypotheses==
{{Main|Multiregional origin of modern humans}}
The multiregional hypothesis, initially proposed by Milford Wolpoff, holds that the evolution of humans from ''H. erectus'' at the beginning of the [[Pleistocene]] 1.8 million years BP to the present day has been within a single, continuous worldwide population. Proponents of multiregional origin reject the assumption of a [[species barrier|infertility barrier]] between ancient Eurasian and African populations of ''Homo''. Multiregional proponents point to the fossil record and [[Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans#Genetic_evidence|genetic evidence]] in chromosomal DNA. One study suggested that at least 5% of the human modern gene pool can be attributed to ancient admixture, which in Europe would be from the [[Neanderthal]]s.<ref name=Plagnol>Plagnol V, Wall JD: Possible ancestral structure in human populations. PLoS Genet 2006, 2:e105.[http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020105.eor]; quote: ''..strong evidence for ancient admixture in both a European and a West African population (p <U+2248> 10<U+2212>7), with contributions to the modern gene pool of at least 5%.
