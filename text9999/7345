TNA held a [[Gauntlet for the Gold|Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold]] to become the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The match came down to [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] and [[Ron Killings]], with Abyss coming out as the victor.

Keller rated the Gauntlet for the Gold and the X Division Championship match each 2 and three-quarter stars out of 5.
