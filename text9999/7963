'''''Arena''''' is a [[live album]] by [[Duran Duran]], originally released worldwide in [[1984 in music|1984]] and reissued with two bonus tracks in [[2004 in music|2004]].  

==Background==

To cap off the band's highly successful 1983/1984 "Sing Blue Silver" World Tour, [[EMI]] released a live album, which according to the sleeve was "Recorded Around The World 1984". 

The album featured most of the band's big hits in a live environment, as well as some album tracks from ''[[Rio (album)|Rio]]'' (1982) and ''[[Seven and the Ragged Tiger]]'' (1983), and a new studio track "[[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]", which was produced by [[Nile Rodgers]], who had previously remixed the single "The Reflex", and had been a member of the disco/funk group [[Chic (band)|Chic]].

"The Wild Boys" single was issued with six separate covers - one featuring each individual band member and one of the band collectively.

At the time of release, critics were suspicious that the mix was too polished for a live album, as most of the audience was muted.  The unique song arrangements and ad-libs like "Is anybody hungry?" indicated that this was indeed a live effort.

Other criticism arose from the omission of some of the band's biggest songs like "The Reflex", "Girls On Film" and "Rio".  However, ''Arena'' still managed to peak at #6 in the UK ([[November 24]]) and #4 in the US ([[December 1]]).

The album was eventually re-issued [[1 June]], [[2004]] and included two bonus tracks "Girls On Film" and "Rio".

''Arena'' would be the only full-length live Duran Duran release until the 2003 Encore Series of official [[bootleg recording]]s from shows in [[Japan]] and the West Coast of the [[USA]].

==Further events==
Capitalising on the band's success, EMI turned the album's release into a multimedia event. The concert film ''[[Arena (An Absurd Notion)]]'', released on long form videotape and broadcast on MTV, was quickly followed by ''The Making of Arena''. These videos featured Duran Duran performing live in [[Oakland, California]] between [[12 April|Apr 12]]-[[15 April|15]], 1984. [[Milo O'Shea]] reprised his role as the evil Dr. [[Durand Durand]] from the movie ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968). 

The ''Arena'' video also featured the extended video for "The Wild Boys", directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]]. It was meant to be a teaser for a full-length feature film of the same name, based on the 1971 novel ''[[The Wild Boys (novel)|The Wild Boys: A Book Of The Dead]]'' by [[William S. Burroughs]]. The film was never made.

Also released were a board game called '''Into The Arena''', a series of collectible cards, the video tour documentary ''[[Sing Blue Silver]]'', and a book about the tour featuring photography by [[Denis O'Regan]], also called '''Sing Blue Silver'''. Both the '''Sing Blue Silver''' documentary and '''Arena (An Absurd Notion)''' were reissued on [[DVD]] in 2004; the ''Arena'' DVD features ''The Making Of Arena'' as an extra.

A differently edited version of ''Arena (An Absurd Notion)'' called '''[[As The Lights Go Down]]''', essentially just the music with the 'plot elements' cut out, was released for broadcast only.

==Other live material==

Two further live cuts from the 1984 world tour were released as B-sides to singles in 1984: "New Religion (Live in LA)" on the North American single for "The Reflex" and the live "Cracks in the Pavement (1984)" on "The Wild Boys". 

"New Religion" was recorded [[9 February]] at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], [[Los Angeles]], and "Cracks in the Pavement" was recorded at the [[5 March]] 1984 show at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in [[Toronto]]. This is the same concert where the video for "The Reflex" was filmed.
