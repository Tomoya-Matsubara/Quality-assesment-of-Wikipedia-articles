The '''Westgate''' is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[gatehouse]] in [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], [[England]]. This 60-foot-high western gate of the [[defensive wall|city wall]] is the largest surviving city gate in England. Built of Kentish [[rag-stone|ragstone]] around 1379, it is still well-preserved and is one of the city's most distinctive landmarks: the last survivor of Canterbury's seven medieval gates. The road still passes between its drum towers, and there is just enough room for a [[double-decker bus]] to pass beneath. This [[scheduled monument]] and Grade I [[listed building]] houses the hundred-year-old West Gate Towers Museum, which is open to the public during limited hours on Saturdays and by special arrangement for groups on weekdays. Access to the museum and roof is via [[stairway|spiral staircases]] only.

===Building history===
[[Image:Westgate 002.jpg|thumb|left|Westgate Towers in [[Edwardian era]]]]
[[Image:Westgate 070.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vaulting (architecture)|Vaulting]] under arch with murder holes]]
Canterbury was [[defensive wall|walled]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] around 300 [[Anno Domini|AD]]. This has been consistently the most important of the city's gates as it is the London Road entrance and the main entrance from most of Kent. The present towers are a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] replacement of the Roman west gate, rebuilt around 1380. There was a gate here at the time of the [[ Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], which is thought to have been Roman. From late [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] times it had the Church of the Holy Cross on top, but both church and gate were dismantled in 1379, and the gate was rebuilt by [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Simon Sudbury]] before he died in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381.<ref name="BaxWestgateTowerHistory">{{cite web|url=http://weblingua.hostinguk.com/invictaweb/canterburybuildings/pages/wstgt.htm|title=Canterbury buildings|last=Bax|first=Stephen|date=2000|work=Westgate Tower|accessdate=28 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="Urry1948">{{cite book|author=William Urry|year=1948|title=Canterbury Mayoral Quincentenary}}</ref><ref name="BritishHistoryReport">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63645|title=City gates}}</ref> It has been suggested that it was built primarily as an entrance for [[pilgrim]]s visiting the shrine of [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas Becket]] at the [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral]].<ref name="CCCWestGateTowersWebpage" />  However the rebuild as a defensive status symbol was paid for partly by Sudbury and partly by taxation for military protection against expected raids by the French.<ref name="TattonBrownWestgate1985">{{cite book|last=Tatton-Brown|first=Tim|coauthors=et al|title=The Westgate (museum leaflet)|publisher=Canterbury City Council|location=Westgate Museum|date=September 1985|accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref> It has been suggested that the spiral staircases were built to the disadvantage of defenders going downstairs who would have had to to fight invaders climbing up to their right: difficult with a one-handed sword in the right hand.  However, slashing with a double-handed sword or pikestaff might have been easier.<ref>Information from museum staff</ref> 

[[Image:Westgate 076.jpg|thumb|right|North tower [[embrasure|gunloop]]]]
It is expensively faced in [[Course (architecture)|coursed]] [[ashlar]] of Kentish [[rag-stone|ragstone]]. It has battered plinths to the drum towers, [[battlement]]s, [[machicolation]]s and eighteen [[embrasure|gunloops]]: a high number for a gateway, and among the earliest gunholes in Britain. The gunloops would have been added by the beginning of the fifteenth century. It had a [[drawbridge]] over the [[River Stour, Kent|Stour]], a [[portcullis]] and wooden doors.<ref name="TattonBrownWestgate1985" /> 

The gateway has three floors.  The ground floor was designed so that the gateway and [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] passage had entrances to the towers on each side. Each tower had a ground-floor room with fireplace and four gunloops. The north tower's ground-floor room had a [[stairway|spiral staircase]] to upper floors. The first floor contains a large room with fireplace and, originally, the portcullis mechanism over the vaulted entranceway.  This room had doors to the upper room of each tower, each with fireplace and three gunloops, and a northern door to a spiral staircase leading to the roof. Repairs were carried out due to an invasion scare during the 1470s and 1480s. In 1491 or 1492 a large, two-light, [[Transom (architectural)|transomed]], [[English Gothic architecture|perpendicular]] east window was added to the large first-floor room, with a view towards the [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral]] and along St Peter's Street.  The roof over the large first-floor central room has a battlemented [[parapet]] walk, originally with access to the tops of both towers and machicolations, as well as to the two low chambers, each with two gunports, in the tops of both towers. This part of the tower was less well-built than the lower storeys, either due to haste during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] or because it was built later. In 1793<U+2212>1794 the hall over the gate was split into three and the present square [[cupola|lantern]] added to the roof, along with the wooden doors and cell linings which are visible today; the cost was <U+00A3>400.<ref name="TattonBrownWestgate1985" /> 

[[Image:Westgate 021.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stairway|Spiral staircase]]]]
The city walls joined the gateway at the back of the drum towers, but this part of the wall was removed in the nineteenth century. Following this, in 1823<U+2212>1829, a jailer's house was built on the north side, and this became a police station and is now a music school. The disused iron bridge which connects the Westgate with the music school dates from this time. Contemporary with this work was the building of St Peter's Place on the south side of the Westgate, along with passages around the Westgte and a new road across the [[River Stour, Kent|Stour]], to cope with increased traffic, which has been damaging the arch of the building for one hundred and fifty years.<ref name="TattonBrownWestgate1985" />

At the end of the 19th century the Westgate was a temporary repository for the city [[archive]]s until the museum was opened in 1908. It is the largest surviving city gate in England.<ref name="BaxWestgateTowerHistory" /><ref name="Urry1948" /><ref name="BritishHistoryReport" /><ref name="TattonBrownWestgate1985" />

===Social history===
[[Image:Westgate 066.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prison cell|Cell]] doors]]
[[File:Canterbury Westgate.jpg|thumb|West Gate Towers next to [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]]]]
Canterbury's [[mayor]] and [[Municipal corporation|corporation]] were grateful to this [[martyr]] to the Revolt who had built them an additional attraction for pilgrims, and they would pray at his tomb or under the Westgate. The head of the rebellious Bluebeard the Hermit was displayed on Westgate in 1450 after he was caught by local people and sent to [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. It is thought that [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] may have undertaken a pilgrimage and passed through the gate. In 1648 after the [[Pride's Purge|Christmas Day riot]], [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] burnt down all the wooden doors of the city's gates. They were all replaced in 1660, but these replacements were removed at the end of the eighteenth century.  They were similar to the surviving wooden [[:File:Christ Church Gate, Canterbury.jpg|Christ Church gates]] at the [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral]]. [[British Royal Family|Royalty]] have entered the city through the gate, including [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1948.<ref name="BaxWestgateTowerHistory" /><ref name="TattonBrownWestgate1985" />

In 1453 Henry VI permitted the Mayor and Commonality to keep a jail at the Westgate, so the building was Canterbury's prison from the 15th to the 19th century, while [[Canterbury Castle]] was the county jail. After repairs to the Westgate and jail in 1667, a [[pound (village)|pound]] was built on the north side; this is now gone, but Pound Lane remains. The guard rooms, heavily wood-lined in the eighteenth century, became cells for both debtors and criminals, and the room over the arch became the condemned cell with the portcullis now laid on top. Until 1775 there was a grated cage in the prison gateway, where certain prisoners were allowed to beg for [[alms]] and speak with passers by. Capital punishment was normally the gallows, plus the stake at [[Wincheap]] for religious martyrs in the time of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].<ref name="BaxWestgateTowerHistory" /><ref name="BaxWestgateTowerHistory" />

===Exhibits===
The present museum was established in 1908, and it currently displays [[weapon|weaponry]] in the guard chamber between the towers above the road, for three hours on Saturdays. In recent years the towers were also open on Sunday afternoons.<ref name="CCCreport2007pdf" /> The roof of one of the towers is accessible via a spiral staircase, and from there an extended view of [[Canterbury]] is visible from between the [[battlement]]s. Exhibits include [[Weapon|armaments]] from the [[English Civil War]] to [[World War II]], original prison cells and murder holes by which defenders could kill enemies entering the gateway: boiling oil, molten lead, cannon balls and other material were dropped. The holes are now covered with thick glass, and cars and buses can be seen passing below.

===Projected closure of museum===
{{Main|Herne Bay Museum and Gallery#Projected closure}}
Since [[City of Canterbury|Canterbury City Council]] suffered loss of income and presented a [[budget]] to save money in late 2009, the museum has been threatened with closure which would take place on 18 February 2010. Pressure groups including archaeologists and schools have combined to present alternative measures.  A meeting was held on 21 January 2009 at which the Council held a preliminary vote to close three museums, including the West Gate Towers Museum.  Objections have been made, and the availability of funds from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] is being considered for at least one museum.<ref name="HBTimes21Jan2010">{{cite news|url=http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/hernebay|title=Herne Bay Times|date=21 January 2010|work=Call for Helpers to Save Museum: Sheriff volunteers to head defence of our Heritage / Recycling Sack Budget U-Turn|publisher=Media UK|pages=4; 6|accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="CCCAgenda210110">{{cite web|url=http://www2.canterbury.gov.uk/committee/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&MId=6363&Ver=4|title=Canterbury City Council Online|date=2010|work=Agenda and Minutes: Executive Thursday, 21st January, 2010 6.30 pm (with audio link)|publisher=CCC|accessdate=26 January 2010|location=Canterbury}}</ref>
