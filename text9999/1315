'''''Beauty and the Beast''''' is a 1991 American [[Animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[Romantic fantasy|romantic fantasy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. Based on the traditional French [[Beauty and the Beast|fairy tale]] of the same name by [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]], ''Beauty and the Beast'' is the 30th film in the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features#Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Animated Classics series.]] Additionally, it is third in the [[Disney Renaissance]] period. Starring [[Paige O'Hara]] and [[Robby Benson]], ''Beauty and the Beast'' focuses on the relationship between the Beast (Benson), a prince who is magically transformed into a monster as punishment for his selfishness, and [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] (O'Hara), a beautiful young woman who he imprisons in his castle. The film also features the voices of Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and Angela Lansbury, who occupy supporting roles.

[[Walt Disney]] first attempted unsuccessfully to adapt "Beauty and the Beast" into an animated feature film during the 1930s and 1950s. Following the success of [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] (1989), Disney decided to adapt the fairy tale, which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical. Disney chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] eventually discontinued the idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar to ''The Little Mermaid'' instead, resulting in Purdum's resignation. ''Beauty and the Beast'' was directed by [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], with a screenplay by [[Linda Woolverton]] story first credited to [[Roger Allers]]. Lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]] wrote the film's songs. Ashman, who additionally served as an executive producer on the film, died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] related complications eight months before the film's release, and the film was dedicated to his memory.

''Beauty and the Beast'' premiered at the [[New York Film Festival]] on September 29, 1991, followed by a theatrical release on November 22 to critical acclaim. It has also earned a rare "A+" rating from [[CinemaScore]].<ref>{{Wayback |date=20010409164227 |url=http://www.cinemascore.com/find_a_movie.epl?id=Beauty_And_The_Beast |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020603093120/http://www.cinemascore.com/find_a_movie.epl?id=Beauty_And_The_Beast |archivedate=2002-06-03 |title=Beauty and the Beast @ CinemaScore}} CinemaScore, Retrieved December 12, 2013</ref> The film was a box office success, and has since garnered over $424 million worldwide. ''Beauty and the Beast'' was nominated for several awards, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture <U+2013> Musical or Comedy]]. Famously, ''Beauty and the Beast'' became the first animated film to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The film received five additional [[Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], and three separate nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].  Ultimately, the film won Best Original Score, while Best Original Song was awarded to its [[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|title song]]. In 2002, ''Beauty and the Beast'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

In April 1994, ''Beauty and the Beast'' became Disney's first animated film to be adapted into a [[Broadway musical]]. The success of the film spawned two [[direct-to-video]] [[midquel]]s: ''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]'' (1997) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World]]'' (1998). This was followed by a spin-off television series, ''[[Sing Me a Story with Belle]]''. An [[IMAX]] [[special edition]] version of the original film was released in 2002, with a new five-minute musical sequence, "[[Human Again (Beauty and the Beast)|Human Again]]", included. After the success of the 3D re-release of ''[[The Lion King]]'', the film returned to theaters in 3D under supervision of [[John Lasseter]] on January 13, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Grady|title='Beauty and the Beast', 'The Little Mermaid', 'Finding Nemo', 'Monsters, Inc.' get 3-D re-releases|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/10/04/disney-3d-beauty-beast-mermaid/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=October 27, 2011|date=October 4, 2011}}</ref>

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
An enchantress, disguised as an beggar, offers a prince a rose asking for shelter in his castle. The prince refuses out of selfishness. In response, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household items. She gives him a magic mirror that enables him to view faraway events, along with the enchanted rose that she had offered. In order to break the curse, the prince must learn to love another and earn her love in return before the rose's last petal falls off. If he fails to do so, he will remain a beast permanently.

Years later, a French bookworm named Belle is bored of her village and seeks excitement. Due to her non-conformity, she is ousted by everyone but her father Maurice and an arrogant, muscular hunter named Gaston. Despite other females fawning over him and many males admiring him, he is determined to marry Belle. She repeatedly rejects his advances.

Maurice and his horse Phillipe get lost in the woods while traveling to a fair to present his wood-chopping machine. After being chased by a pack of wolves, he comes across the Beast's castle. Inside, he meets Lumi<U+00E8>re the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, and her son Chip the teacup. However, the Beast quickly finds and imprisons Maurice. After Phillipe leads Belle to the Beast's castle, she offers to take her father's place. The Beast accepts the offer despite Maurice's objections. While Gaston sulks over Belle's rejection, Maurice returns to town and unconvincingly asks for help to rescue Belle from the Beast.

The Beast angrily refuses to let Belle have any dinner that night after she refuses to dine with him. Despite this, Lumi<U+00E8>re offers her a meal. While he and Cogsworth also give her a tour of the castle, she wanders into the forbidden West Wing. After chasing her away where she encounters a pack of wolves, the Beast is injured after fending them off. She thanks him for saving her life. He begins to develop feelings for her while she nurses his wounds and delights her by showing his extensive library. While the two begin to bond, Gaston pays Monsieur d'Arque to send Maurice to the town's insane asylum if Belle refuses Gaston's proposal again.

While sharing a romantic evening together, Belle tells the Beast she misses Maurice. He lets her use his magic mirror to see him. She sees Maurice dying in the woods trying to rescue her. The Beast lets her go out to rescue him and gives her the mirror to remember him by. She finds Maurice and brings him home. As Gaston is about to bring Maurice to the insane asylum, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by showing the Beast with the magic mirror. Realizing Belle loves the Beast, Gaston convinces the townspeople that the Beast is a man-eating monster and leads them to the castle to kill him. He confines Belle and Maurice to their basement. 

Having snuck into Belle's baggage, Chip manages to free them. Gaston confronts the beast while the servants fend off the villagers. The Beast initially is too depressed to fight back, though perks up after seeing Belle return to the castle. He battles and defeats Gaston in battle on the rooftops, though spares his life by ordering him to leave. Gaston stabs him in the behind as the Beast reunites with Belle. Gaston loses his balance in the process and falls to his death. Before the Beast dies, Belle announces she loves him just before the roses' last petal falls. With the spell broken, the Beast comes back to life. He and his servants are restored to human form. Belle dances with him in the ballroom.

==Production==

===Early versions===
After the success of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1938, [[Walt Disney]] sought out other stories to adapt into feature films, with ''Beauty and the Beast'' being among the stories he considered.<ref name="makingof"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions From Bosko to Bart Simpson |last=Sito |first=Tom |year=2006 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-2407-7 |page=301}}</ref> Attempts to develop the ''Beauty and the Beast'' story into a film were made in the 1930s and 1950s, but were ultimately given up because it "proved to be a challenge" for the story team.<ref name="makingof"/> Peter M. Nichols states Disney may later have been discouraged by [[Jean Cocteau]] having already done [[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|his version]].<ref name="Nichols">{{cite book |title=The New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies |first=Peter M. |last=Nichols |year=2003 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-7198-9 |pages=27<U+2013>30}}</ref>

Decades later, during the production of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected ''Beauty and the Beast'' as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on ''Roger Rabbit''. [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]], who had directed the animated portions of ''Roger Rabbit'', was approached to direct, but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer [[Don Hahn]] on a non-musical version of ''Beauty and the Beast'' set in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] France.<ref name="wakingsleepingbeauty">{{cite video|people=[[Don Hahn|Hahn, Don]] |title=[[Waking Sleeping Beauty]] |medium=Documentary film |publisher=Stone Circle Pictures/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures |location=Burbank, California |date=2009 }}</ref> At the behest of Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]], ''Beauty and the Beast'' became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on [[storyboard]]s rather than in scripted form. [[Linda Woolverton]] wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.<ref name="story">{{cite book|last=Thomas |first=Bob |year=1991 |title=Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Beauty and the Beast |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |pages=142<U+2013>7 |isbn=1-56282-899-1}}</ref>

===Script rewrite and musicalization===
[[File:Jeffrey Katzenberg 2010 Shrek Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|Upon seeing the initial storyboard reels in 1989, Walt Disney Studios chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch.]]
Upon seeing the initial storyboard reels in 1989, Walt Disney Studios chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch. A few months after starting anew, Purdum resigned as director. The studio had approached [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] to direct the film but turned down the offer saying they were "tired" after just having finished directing Disney's recent success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Disney then hired first-time feature directors [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]]. Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of ''[[Cranium Command]]'', a short film for a Disney [[EPCOT]] theme park attraction. In addition, Katzenberg asked songwriters [[Howard Ashman]] and [[Alan Menken]], who had written the song score for ''The Little Mermaid'' to turn ''Beauty and the Beast'' into a Broadway-style musical film in the same vein as ''Mermaid''. Ashman, who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS, had been working with Disney on a pet project of his, ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team. To accommodate Ashman's failing health, pre-production of ''Beauty and the Beast'' was moved from London to the [[Residence Inn]] in [[Fishkill, New York]], close to Ashman's New York City home.<ref name="wakingsleepingbeauty"/> Here, Ashman and Menken joined Wise, Trousdale, Hahn, and Woolverton in retooling the film's script.<ref name="makingof"/><ref name="story"/> Since the original story had only two major characters, the filmmakers enhanced them, added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who "add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story" and guide the audience through the film, and added a "real villain" in the form of Gaston.<ref name="makingof"/> 

These ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the [[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|1946 French film version of ''Beauty and the Beast'']], which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston<ref>{{cite book|first=Jerome |last=Griswold |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ecQuvwSSgzEC&pg=RA1-PA249&dq=%22gaston%22%22beauty+and+the+beast%22%22avenant%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22gaston%22%22beauty%20and%20the%20beast%22%22avenant%22 |title=The Meanings of "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2004 |page=249 |isbn=1-55111-563-8}}</ref> as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast's castle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.wcsu.edu/mccarneyh/fva/c/La_Belle_et_la_Bete_780.html |title=La Belle et la Bete |first=Kim |last=Humphreville |work=WCSU |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version.

===Animation===
[[File:Beauty and the beast.jpg|270px|left|thumb|A frame from the "Beauty and the Beast" ballroom dance sequence. The background is animated using [[computer generated imagery]] which, when the traditionally animated characters are composited against it using Disney's [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]] system, gives the illusion of a [[Tracking shot|dollying]] film camera.]]

Production of ''Beauty and the Beast'' had to be completed on a compressed timeline of two years rather than four because of the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdum version of the film.<ref name="dvdcommentary"/> Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio, housed in the Air Way facility in [[Glendale, California]]. A smaller team at the [[Disney-MGM Studios]] [[theme park]] in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]] assisted the California team on several scenes, particularly the "Be Our Guest" number.<ref name="makingof"/>

''Beauty and the Beast'' was the second film, following ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', produced using [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS (Computer Animation Production System)]], a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by [[Pixar]].<ref name="makingof"/><ref name="wakingsleepingbeauty"/> The software allowed for a wider range of colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for [[xerography]] in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate [[multiplane]] effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the [[Z-axis]] to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.<ref name="dvdcommentary"/>

In addition, CAPS allowed easier combination of hand-drawn art with [[computer-generated imagery]], which before had to be [[plotter|plotted]] to animation paper and then xeroxed and painted traditionally.<ref name="makingof"/><ref>(2006) Audio Commentary by John Musker, Ron Clements, and Alan Menken. Bonus material from ''The Little Mermaid: Platinum Edition'' [DVD].

===Music===
{{See also|Beauty and the Beast (soundtrack)}}
Ashman and Menken wrote the ''Beauty'' song score during the pre-production process in Fishkill, the opening [[operetta]]-styled "Belle" being their first composition for the film. Other songs included "[[Be Our Guest]]," sung (in its original version) to Maurice by the objects when he becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade, "Gaston," a solo for the swaggering villain, "Human Again," a song describing Belle and Beast's growing love from the objects' perspective, the love ballad "Beauty and the Beast," and the climactic "The Mob Song." As story and song development came to a close, full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City.<ref name="makingof"/> The ''Beauty'' songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than [[overdub]]bed separately, in order to give the songs a [[cast album]]-like "energy" the filmmakers and songwriters desired.<ref name="dvdcommentary"/>

During the course of production, many changes were made to the structure of the film, necessitating the replacement and re-purposing of songs. After screening a mostly animated version of the "Be Our Guest" sequence, story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father. Wise and Trousdale agreed, and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle. The film's title song went through a noted bit of uncertainty during production. Originally conceived as a rock-oriented song, it was changed to a slow, romantic ballad. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken asked Angela Lansbury to perform the song, but she didn't think her voice was suited for the melody. When she voiced her doubts, Menken and Ashman asked her for at least one take, and told her to perform the song as she saw fit. Lansbury reportedly reduced everyone in the studio to tears with her rendition, nailing the song in the one take asked of her. This version went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song. "Human Again" was dropped from the film before animation began, as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place.<ref name="makingof" /> This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place. "Something There," in which Belle and Beast sing (via voiceover) of their growing fondness for each other, was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of "Human Again."<ref name="dvdcommentary"/>

Menken would later revise "Human Again" for inclusion in the 1994 Broadway stage version of ''Beauty and the Beast'', and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film's Special Edition re-release in 2002.<ref name="makingof" /><ref name="dvdcommentary"/> Ashman died of AIDS-related complications on March 14, 1991, eight months prior to the release of the film. He never saw the finished film, though he did get to see it in its unfinished format. Ashman's work on ''Aladdin'' was completed by another lyricist, [[Tim Rice]]. Before Ashman's death, members of the film's production team visited him after the film's well-received first screening, with Don Hahn commenting that "the film would be a great success. Who'd have thought it?", to which Ashman replied with "I would." A tribute to the lyricist was included at the end of the credits crawl: "''To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice, and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman: 1950<U+2013>1991''."<ref name="wakingsleepingbeauty"/> A pop version of the "Beauty and the Beast" theme, performed by [[C<U+00E9>line Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]] over the end credits, was released as a commercial single from the film's [[Beauty and the Beast (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], supported with a music video. The Dion/Bryson version of "Beauty and the Beast" became an international pop hit, reaching the Top Ten of the singles charts in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/search/?keyword=Where+Does+My+Heart+Beat+Now#/song/celine-dion/beauty-and-the-beast-from-beauty-and-the/315262 |title=Beauty and the Beast (From Beauty and the Beast) <U+2013> Peabo Bryson |work=Billboard |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

''Beauty and the Beast ''has garnered widespread critical acclaim. Review aggregation [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 101 critics.

Michael Barrier wrote that Belle "becomes a sort of intellectual less by actually reading books, it seems, than by hanging out with them", but says that the film comes closer than other "Disney-studio" films to "accepting challenges of the kind that the finest Walt Disney features met".<ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age |last=Barrier |first=Michael |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503759-6 |page=571}}</ref> David Whitley writes in ''The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation'' that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework, although her role is somewhat undefined in the same way that "contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave home and have to take on the fraught, multiple responsibilities of the working mother".

==Musical adaptation==
According to an article in ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]'', "The catalyst for Disney's braving the stage was an article by ''[[New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Frank Rich]] that praised ''Beauty and the Beast'' as 1991's best musical.... [[Theatre Under The Stars (Houston)|Theatre Under The Stars]] executive director Frank Young had been trying to get Disney interested in a stage version of ''Beauty'' about the same time Eisner and Katzenberg were mulling over Rich's column. But Young couldn't seem to get in touch with the right person in the Disney empire. Nothing happened till the Disney execs started to pursue the project from their end.... When they asked George Ives, the head of Actors Equity on the West Coast, which Los Angeles theater would be the best venue for launching a new musical, Ives said the best theater for that purpose would be TUTS. Not long after that, Disney's Don Frantz and Bettina Buckley contacted Young, and the partnership was under way."<ref name=chronicle>
