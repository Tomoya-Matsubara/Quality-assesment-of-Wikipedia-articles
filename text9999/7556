'''George L. Rider''' (c. 1891 &ndash; August 8, 1979) was an American [[Coach (sports)|sports coach]] and athletics administrator at [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]]. During his career he served as the head coach of [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[Track and field|track]] and [[Cross country running|cross country]] teams.  In 1959 Rider served as honorary president of the International Track and Field Coaches Association.  He is a charter member of [[Miami University]]'s Hall of Fame along with coaching legends including [[Walter Alston]], [[Earl Blaik]], [[Paul Brown]], [[Weeb Ewbank]], [[Ara Parseghian]] and [[John Pont]].

==Coaching career==
===Track===
Rider is best known for his 36 years of coaching track and cross country from 1924 to 1960. His track teams won nine [[Buckeye Conference]] titles and 10 consecutive [[Mid-American Conference]] championships. Also, his cross country teams captured nine Mid-American Conference Championships.  In 1957, Rider was selected to the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame. Additionally, [[Miami University|Miami]]'s track is named in his honor for his contributions to the university athletic department.

===Football===
Rider became [[Miami University]]'s head coach for the 1917 and 1918 seasons because [[George Little (American football coach)|George Little]] was serving in the armed forces during [[World War I]].  In his two years he never lost a game and won back to back [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] championships.  His 1917 football team outscored its opponents 202&ndash;0. This team went 6&ndash;0&ndash;2 with the only blemishes being scoreless ties with both [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] and the [[College of Wooster]].  Rider's second season was just as successful with his team going 5&ndash;0&ndash;1.  However, games against Kentucky, Wooster, and [[Wittenberg Tigers football|Wittenberg]] were canceled due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]].  Rider stepped down when George Little returned to Oxford from World War I.
