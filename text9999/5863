'''State Route&nbsp;202''' ('''SR&nbsp;202, OH&nbsp;202''') is a {{convert|21.28|mi|km|adj=on}}  north&ndash;south [[state highway]] in the western part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]].  The highway runs from its southern terminus at an interchange with the [[Ohio State Route 4|SR&nbsp;4]] freeway in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] to its northern terminus at a T-intersection with [[Ohio State Route 55|SR&nbsp;55]] in the eastern end of [[Troy, Ohio|Troy]].

The debut of SR&nbsp;202 took place in the middle of the 1920s.  For much of its length, it parallels [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|Interstate&nbsp;75]] (I-75), which runs about {{convert|3|mi|km}} to the west.  Along the way, SR&nbsp;202 also travels near the eastern edge of the [[Great Miami River]].  

==Route description==
SR&nbsp;202 traverses northeastern [[Montgomery County, Ohio|Montgomery County]] and southeastern [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] along its way.  The highway begins in Dayton at an interchange between the SR&nbsp;4 freeway and Troy Street, one block north of where Troy Street meets Valley Street on the northern banks of the [[Mad River (Ohio)|Mad River]].  SR&nbsp;202 starts out as an urban roadway that heads north, then bends to the northeast, running parallel to the [[Great Miami River]] for a couple of miles.  Entering into a more suburban setting, SR&nbsp;202 passes through the old village of Hooks Corner where it meets Needmore Road, then proceeds into the Dayton [[suburb]] of [[Huber Heights, Ohio|Huber Heights]].  After curving to the north, SR&nbsp;202 meets [[Interstate 70 (Ohio)|I-70]] at its Exit 36, a [[diamond interchange]].  A short distance later, SR&nbsp;202 crosses into Miami County.<ref name="YahooMap">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=39.903594&lon=-84.217189&zoom=11&q1=39.771551%2C-84.17496&w0=39.80115102364284%2C-84.1552734375&q2=40.041068%2C-84.181999|title=Overview Map of State Route 202 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>

Now into [[Bethel Township, Miami County, Ohio|Bethel Township]], the state highway travels northerly amidst a residential area prior to intersecting [[U.S. Route 40 (Ohio)|U.S. Route&nbsp;40]] (US&nbsp;40) at a signalized intersection in the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Phoneton, Ohio|Phoneton]].  SR&nbsp;202 passes into a more rural setting composed primarily of farmland, with some clumps of trees and houses appearing along the way.  It goes through the unincorporated community of [[West Charleston, Ohio|West Charleston]], then goes on to meet [[Ohio State Route 571|SR&nbsp;571]] at a signalized intersection east of [[Tipp City, Ohio|Tipp City]].  North of SR&nbsp;571, SR&nbsp;202 curves to the northwest, clipping the southwest corner of [[Elizabeth Township, Miami County, Ohio|Elizabeth Township]] prior to crossing into [[Staunton Township, Miami County, Ohio|Staunton Township]].  The route bends to the north immediately before it meets [[Ohio State Route 41|SR&nbsp;41]] at a signalized intersection.  SR&nbsp;202 turns back to the northwest a short distance before it arrives at its endpoint at SR&nbsp;55 at a T-intersection in the far eastern end of Troy, just north of the Miami Shores Golf Course.<ref name="YahooMap"/>

There is no portion of SR&nbsp;202 that is included within the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS).  The NHS is a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.<ref name="NHS">{{cite map | title=National Highway System: Ohio | date=December 2003 | publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] | url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/oh/oh_Ohio.pdf | format=PDF|accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>

==History==
The SR&nbsp;202 designation was applied in 1923.  Originally, the highway followed the majority of its present routing, from its southern terminus in Dayton to its junction with SR&nbsp;41, at the time designated as SR&nbsp;70.  It then followed the current SR&nbsp;41's alignment northwest into downtown Troy, then crossed the Great Miami River concurrently with SR&nbsp;55.  SR&nbsp;202 then split from SR&nbsp;55, and was routed along Market Street heading northeast.  The state highway then followed what is today known as County Road&nbsp;193 (CR&nbsp;193), heading east from Troy into [[Champaign County, Ohio|Champaign County]].  It came to an end at SR&nbsp;55 southwest of [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]].<ref name=ODOT1922_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio State Highways |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1922a.sid |format=[[MrSID]] |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways and Public Works |date=April 1922 |cartography=ODHPW |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref><ref name=ODOT1923_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Routes |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1923a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways and Public Works |date=July 1923 |cartography=ODHPW |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>  In 1925, the entire east&ndash;west portion of SR&nbsp;202 along the current CR&nbsp;193 was removed from the state highway system.  Consequently, the highway was shortened to its present alignment between Dayton and the current SR&nbsp;41 junction.<ref name=ODOT1925_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Routes |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1925a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways and Public Works |date=August 1925 |cartography=ODHPW |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref><ref name=ODOT1926_map>{{cite map |title=Map of Ohio Showing State Routes |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1926a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways and Public Works |date=August 1926 |cartography=ODHPW |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>

The current northernmost portion of SR&nbsp;202 between SR&nbsp;41 and SR&nbsp;55 was brought into the state highway system, and assigned the designation of SR&nbsp;504.<ref name=ODOT1936_map>{{cite map |title=Official Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1936a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1936 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref><ref name=ODOT1937_map>{{cite map |title=Official Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1937a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Highways |date=1937 |cartography=ODOH |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>  It would be until 1982 before SR&nbsp;504 would be replaced by a northward extension of SR&nbsp;202, resulting in SR&nbsp;202 taking on the routing that it utilizes today.<ref name=ODOT1981_map>{{cite map |title=Official Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1981a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation |date=1981 |cartography=ODOT |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref><ref name=ODOT1982_map>{{cite map |title=Official Ohio Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/prod_services/Documents/StateMaps/otm1982a.sid |format=MrSID |publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation |date=1982 |cartography=ODOT |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>
