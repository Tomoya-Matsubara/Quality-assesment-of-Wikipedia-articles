'''Saltaire''' is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[model village]] within the [[City of Bradford]] Metropolitan District, [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]], by the [[River Aire]] and the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. [[UNESCO]] has designated the village as a [[World Heritage Site]], and it is a so-called Anchor Point of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]].

== History ==

Saltaire was founded in 1853 by Sir [[Titus Salt]], a leading industrialist in the Yorkshire woollen industry. The name of the village is a combination of the founder's surname with the name of the river.  Salt moved his entire business (five separate mills) from [[Bradford]] to this site near [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] partly to provide better arrangements for his workers than could be had in Bradford and partly to site his large [[textile mill]] by a [[canal]] and a [[railway]].  Salt employed the Bradford firm of [[Lockwood and Mawson]] as his architects.<ref name="Greenhalf">{{cite book|title=Salt & Silver: A Story of Hope|last=Greenhalf|first=Jim|publisher=Bradford Libraries|year=1997|id=ISBN 0 907734-52-9}}</ref>

A similar project had been started a few years earlier by [[Edward Akroyd]] at [[Copley, West Yorkshire|Copley]], also in West Yorkshire.  The [[cotton mill]]ing village of [[New Lanark]], which is also a World Heritage site, was founded by [[David Dale]] in 1786.  

Salt built neat stone houses for his workers (much better than the [[slums]] of Bradford), wash-houses with [[running water]], [[Public bathing|bath-house]]s, a [[hospital]], as well as an Institute for recreation and education, with a [[library]], a [[reading room]], a [[concert hall]], [[billiard]] room, science [[laboratory]] and [[gym]]nasium. The village also provided a school for the children of the workers, [[almshouse]]s, [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]], a park and a [[boathouse]].<ref name='Holroyd'>{{cite book|title=Saltaire and its Founder|last=Holroyd|first=Abraham|origyear=1873|year=2000|publisher=Piroisms Press|id=ISBN 0-9538601-0-8}}</ref>

Sir Titus died in 1876 and was interred in the [[mausoleum]] adjacent to the Congregational Church. When Sir Titus Salt's son, likewise Sir Titus Salt, died, Saltaire was taken over by a partnership which included [[Sir James Roberts]] from [[Haworth]] who had worked at the mill since the age of twelve, and who would travel to [[Russia]] each year, speaking [[Russian language|Russian]] fluently. James Roberts came to own Saltaire, but chose to invest his money heavily in Russia, losing some of his fortune at the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. He endowed a [[Chair (academic)|Chair]] of Russian at [[Leeds University]] and bought the [[Bront<U+00EB>]]'s [[Haworth Parsonage]] for the nation. He is mentioned in T.S. Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]''. Roberts is buried at [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].<ref name='holloway'>{{cite web|url=http://www.umilta.net/SirJamesRoberts.html|title=Sir James Roberts|last=Holloway|first=Julia Bolton|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

== Saltaire today ==

In December 2001, Saltaire was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1028|title=Saltaire - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>  This means that the government has a duty to protect the site. The buildings belonging to the model village are individually [[listed buildings|listed]], with the highest level of protection being given to the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] Church (since 1972 known as the [[United Reformed Church]]) which is listed grade I. The village has survived remarkably complete, but further protection is needed: the village is somewhat blighted by traffic, as the Aire valley is an important East-West route. A bypass is proposed to relieve traffic pressure somewhat (see below). Roberts Park, on the North side of the river, has suffered over the years from neglect and [[vandalism]], and is currently (2009) being restored by [[City of Bradford#Council|Bradford Council]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/district/district_shipley/district_shipley_saltaire/4274921.__4_5m_Saltaire_park_scheme_under_way/|title=Roberts Park on schedule for 2010 opening|publisher-[[Bradford Telegraph & Argus]]|date=2009-04-08|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

Saltaire is also a [[Conservation Area]]. Victoria Hall (originally the Saltaire Institute) is used for meetings and concerts, and also houses the [[Victorian Reed Organ Museum]]. The village is served by [[Saltaire railway station]].

The [[Saltaire Festival]], which first took place in 2003 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the foundation of Saltaire, is now held every year over eleven days in September.

== Proposed bypass ==

Saltaire is surrounded by a [[Buffer zone]] established to protect the context of the World Heritage Site. Concerns have been raised over plans recently announced by Bradford Council and Action Airedale to run a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] through the buffer zone either side of the World Heritage Site and to tunnel beneath the village itself<ref>[http://www.saltairevillagesociety.com/bypass/index.html General information on the proposed bypass]</ref>. Within sight of the mill, the tunnel will follow the line of the railway and exit behind the United Reformed Church<ref>[http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=116169194717293747992.00000112bde3ce150dea8&t=h&om=1&ll=53.838146,-1.78957&spn=0.032008,0.080338&z=14 Google Maps] with proposed tunnel and protected areas.</ref>. As it then runs alongside the adjacent portion of the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], it is also likely to have an impact on this Conservation Area. The current route will also impact on an ancient semi-natural woodland and the Woodland Garden of Remembrance at Nab Wood Cemetery.<ref>[http://www.sweeble.com/story/view/1530 Saltaire World Heritage Site in Danger], Sweeble, 20 Jun 2007.</ref>

== Salts Mill today ==

[[Salts Mill]] closed in February 1986, and Jonathan Silver bought it the following year and began renovating it.<ref name='Greenhalf'/>  Today it houses a mixture of business, commerce, leisure and residential use.
In the main mill building are:
* The 1853 [[art gallery|Gallery]]: several large rooms given over to the works of the Bradford-born [[artist]] [[David Hockney]]: including [[painting]]s, [[drawings]], [[photomontage]]s and  [[scenery|stage sets]].
* Industrial companies including the [[electronics]] manufacturer [[Pace plc]].
* Various shops. In 2006 there are shops selling books, art supplies, jewellery, outdoor wear, antiques, suits, bicycles, and housewares; the last includes pieces by internationally known designers such as [[Alvar Aalto]] and [[Philippe Starck]].
* Restaurants and cafes.

The "New Mill", on the other side of the canal, is divided between offices for the local National Health Service Trusts and residential apartments.
