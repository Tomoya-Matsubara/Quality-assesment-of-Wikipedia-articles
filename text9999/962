The aircraft's [[flight recorder]] was recovered on 9 May<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nycaviation.com/2011/05/searchers-recover-black-box-of-crashed-indonesian-plane/ | title=Searchers Recover Black Box of Crashed Indonesian Plane | publisher=NYC Aviation | date=9 May 2011 | accessdate=15 May 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yuH1CrxW|archivedate=23 May 2011}}</ref> after a search that was hampered by a strong underwater current that necessitated the fuselage to be anchored to the seabed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/05/09/356405/ma60-crash-investigators-hunt-cockpit-voice-recorder.html | title=MA60 crash investigators hunt cockpit-voice recorder |work=Flight International  | date=9 May 2011 | accessdate=15 May 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yuGrvzoN|archivedate=23 May 2011}}</ref> After examination, it was discovered that the contents of the recorder were encrypted in Chinese; as a result, the recorder was sent to China to be decrypted.<ref name="jglobe">{{cite web | url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/sby-orders-safety-probe-of-merpati-planes-after-crash/440829 | title=SBY Orders Safety Probe of <U+2009>Merpati Planes After Crash | publisher=The Jakarta Globe | date=13 May 2011 | accessdate=15 May 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yuGtdRzy|archivedate=23 May 2011}}</ref>

On 10 May, Merpati Nusantara's president, Sardjono Jhony Tjitrokusumo offered to resign if the crash was the fault of the airline, saying that "I am ready to tender my resignation if the error was from Merpati's side."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/05/10/356441/merpati-president-offers-to-quit-after-crash.html | title=Merpati president offers to quit after crash |work=Flight International  | date=10 May 2011 | accessdate=15 May 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yuGxyd9n|archivedate=23 May 2011}}</ref>

On 13 May, the Indonesian government ordered Merpati Nusantara to perform safety inspections on its other twelve MA60 aircraft.<ref name="jglobe"/> In announcing the order, President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] said that "[t]here should be a prevention effort and inspection of the same type of Merpati aircraft [...] This [is] important to the public so they can get clear explanation."<ref name="jglobe"/>

==Cause==
On May 2012, the [[National Transportation Safety Committee]] (NTSC) released its final report on the investigation. It is determined that pilot errors were the major contributor to the crash. Pilots aborted landing and performed a sharp left turn with an excessively high bank angle of 38 degrees. It was also found that the pilots did not follow normal procedure by retracting the flaps, causing the aircraft to lose altitude rapidly. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dephub.go.id/knkt/ntsc_aviation/baru/Final%20Report%20PK-MZK%20Release.pdf | title=NTSC Report |work=NTSC Report |location=ID | | date=7 May 2012 | accessdate=7 May 2012 | archiveurl=http://www.dephub.go.id/knkt/ntsc_aviation/baru/Final%20Report%20PK-MZK%20Release.pdf | archivedate=7 May 2012}}</ref>
