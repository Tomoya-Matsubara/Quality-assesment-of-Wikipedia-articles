Additionally, criticism of an expansionist monetary policy was also leveled on the developed economies. A final statement was not forthcoming over the issue of Cuba's inclusion in the next summit which was supported by all states except the United States and Canada. However, the [[7th summit of the Americas]] would be held in Panama.

==Background==
The [[Summits of the Americas]] are a continuing series of summits bringing together the leaders of the Americas including [[North America]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]], except Cuba.  The function of these summits is to foster discussion of a variety of issues affecting the western hemisphere. These high-level summit meetings have been organised by a number of multilateral bodies{{which|date=April 2012}} under the aegis of the [[Organization of American States]]. In the early 1990s, what were formerly ''ad hoc'' summits came to be institutionalised into a regular "Summits of the Americas" conference programme.<ref name="twaddle382">Twaddle, Andrew C. (2002). [http://books.google.com/books?id=71x7NlQ_xfgC&pg=PA382&dq=summit+of+the+Americas&client=firefox-a  ''Health Care Reform Around the World,'' p. 382.]</ref>

In regards to a potential controversy sparked by boycotts over the exclusion of Cuba, host president Santos flew to Cuba where he got assurances from [[Raul Castro]] that the country would not insist on attendance that could have embarrased Colombia.<ref name="france"/>

==Agenda==
[[Image:Cumbre_de_Cartagena_Shakira.jpg|thumb|200px|Opening ceremony of the 6th Summit of the Americas with a performance by [[Shakira]].]]
Host leader [[Juan Manuel Santos]] said that the issue of Cuba was one matter that would be discussed.<ref name="reuters"/> Another important issue would be the [[War on Drugs]] amid U.S. allies Guatemala and Colombia calling for the [[legalisation of drugs]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Arsenault|first=Chris|title=US allies call for drug legalisation|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/04/2012413142349136990.html|work=Al Jazeera|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=13 April 2012}}</ref> a move the United States rejects with President [[Barack Obama]] saying before the summit that the U.S. would not support the measure to "legalise or decriminalise drugs because doing so would have serious negative consequences in all our countries in terms of public health and safety." He also said the Cuban issue was moot to the U.S. claiming that the [[government of Cuba]] has "shown no interest in changing their [[Cuba-United States relations|relationship with the United States]], nor any willingness to respect the democratic and human rights of the Cuban people."<ref name="france"/> The U.S. and Canada cited a clause in OAS' charter that only includes democratically elected governments for their decisions not to invite Cuba.<Ref name="clause"/>

The ongoing crisis and "war of words" between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the [[Falkland Islands]], which has also resulted in a ban on marine vessels entering ports in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay if they are coming from the islands<ref>{{cite web|title=South American states ban Falklands vessels from ports|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16280613|work=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=21 December 2011}}</ref> and controversy over the "militarisation" of the conflict,<ref>{{cite web|author=April 2, 2012&nbsp;|&nbsp; 4:13 pm |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/04/argentina-falklands-anniversary-tension-burning-effigy.html |title=Prince William burned in effigy on Falklands War anniversary |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Prince William burned in effigy on Falklands War anniversary|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/04/argentina-falklands-anniversary-tension-burning-effigy.html|accessdate=14 April 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2 April 2012}}</ref> was also said to be a point of discussion. Venezuelan Foreign Minister [[Nicol<U+00E1>s Maduro]] said that "there should not be colonial possessions in our America."<ref name="Al Jazeera 2012-04-14 1" /> Argentinean Foreign Minister [[Hector Timerman]] said he hoped the summit would result in a "new manifestation of solidarity" over the dispute of the islands.<ref name=france>{{cite web|title=Americas summit to open marred by bombings|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120414-americas-summit-open-marred-bombings|work=AFP|publisher=France 24|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=14 April 2012}}</ref>

===Discussions===
The discussions at the summit included Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s crticism of U.S. expansionist monetary policy that she said was contributing to uncontrolled capital inflows causing emerging market currencies to appreciate and would hurt trade competitiveness. "The way these countries, the most developed ones, especially in the euro region in the last year, have reacted to the crisis with monetary expansion has produced a monetary tsunami. Obviously we have to take measures to defend ourselves. Note the word I chose - 'defend', not 'protect.'" Santos reiterated the criticism saying that "in some way, [they] are exporting their crisis to us via the appreciation of our currencies." He also opened the summit with the issue of Cuba: "It's an anachronism that keeps us anchored to a Cold War era we came out of various decades ago. [Another summit without Cuba is] unacceptable."<ref name="discussion"/> He also accused those who opposed Cuba inclusion as having "ideological stubbornness," as well as saying Haiti "on its knees is unacceptable."<ref name="newman"/> The member states of ALBA also added that a summit without Cuba was "unjustified and unsustainable" and that they would boycott summits without Cuba. For his part, despite saying, the United States wanted to work "as equal partners with our brothers and sisters in Latin America and the Caribbean" because of the potential for trade between "nearly a billion consumers," Obama dismissed a possibility of reform on the United States' Cuba policy and drug legalisation:<ref name="discussion"/>
<blockquote>Sometimes those controversies date back to before I was born. And sometimes I feel as if ... we're caught in a time warp ... going back to the 1950s, gunboat diplomacy, and Yankees, and the Cold War and this and that.<p>I don't mind a debate around issues like decriminalisation. I personally don't agree that's a solution to the problem. But I think that given the pressures that a lot of governments are under here, under-resourced, overwhelmed by violence, it's completely understandable that they would look for new approaches, and we want to cooperate with them."</blockquote>

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said of Obama that his inner circle of advisers deliberately ensure that he is kept ignorant of the regional reality and that it was distasteful to Latin Americans that he visited Cartagena. He added: "Unfortunately, after three years in office he has inherited the cynicism and perversion of his predecessor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chavez Misses Summit Fueling Cancer Scare|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-14/chavez-skips-americas-summit-for-more-cancer-treatment-in-cuba|accessdate=15 April 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=15 April 2012|author=Nathan Crooks|author2=Matthew Bristow}}</ref> 

Bilateral meetings at the summit included those between the United States and Guatemala, El Salvador, Argentina and Peru.<Ref name="close"/>

===Conclusions===
Argentina's Hector Timerman, who was not at the summit, said that a declaration from the summit was held up over the inclusion of Cuba that was supported by 32 countries but opposed by the U.S.<ref name="discussion">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/04/2012414231949570828.html |title=Obama firm on drug and Cuba policies |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref> He added that "there will be no final declaration of the summit because the United States vetoed the articles about Cuba, a veto that Canada joined."<ref name="arg">{{cite web|title=WRAPUP 5-Latin America rebels against Obama over Cuba|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/15/americas-summit-idUSL2E8FF1L020120415|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Andrew Cawthorne and Brian Ellsworth|date=15 April 2012}}</ref> Canada's [[Stephen Harper]] was, however, reportedly considering a final declaration that would include calls for the reincorporation of Cuba without conditions, albeit with their reservations.<ref name="newman">{{cite web|author=Lucia Newman |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/americas/2012/04/15/obama-casualty-cold-war |title=Obama: A casualty of the Cold War? |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.com |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref> The ALBA member states also said they would boycott any future summits without the inclusion of Cuba.<ref name="clause">{{cite web|last=Boadle|first=Anthony|title=Cuba's allies to boycott future Americas summits|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/14/us-americas-summit-cuba-idUSBRE83D0HJ20120414|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=15 April 2012|date=14 April 2012}}</ref> Argentina and Uruguay's foreign ministers also said that they would not sign a declaration without the U.S. and Canada's veto of Cuban participitation was withdrawn. Colombia and Brazil also reiterated commets that there would not be a summit anymore without Cuba.

At the close of the summit at about noon on 15 April, Santos said: "There is no declaration because there is no consensus. Hopefully within three years we can have Cuba." However, he added that the 2015 summit would be held in Panama.<Ref name="close">http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/04/2012415202912826108.html</reF>

==Security==
The National Police of Colombia revealed that the security for the summit would entail an additional 5,000 police members to the 3,000 members of the Cartagena Metropolitan Police, who will be aided by [[CCTV]], robots and anti-explosive dogs.{{Fact|date=April 2012}} The day before the summit two explosions occurred in Bogot<U+00E1> near the U.S. embassy at about 19:30<ref name="france"/> and two other explositions followed in Cartagena.<ref name="Al Jazeera 2012-04-14 1" />

==Delegation leaders==
[[File:Jefes de Estado en la Cumbre de Cartagena de Indias, 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|Partial group photo of leaders at the summit.]]
Ecuador will not be attending the summit because of the exclusion of Cuba and other "essential issues." President [[Rafael Correa]] wrote a letter to the host Juan Manual Santos that read: "After some reflection I have decided that while I am the president of Ecuador, I will not attend any Summit of the Americas until it begins to make the decisions required. There has been talk of lack of consensus, but we all know that this is the veto of foreign powers, the intolerable situation in our 21st century America." He also reiterated that the boycott was not a slight on Colombia or Santos.<ref name=reuters>{{cite web|last=Valencia|first=Alexandra|title=Ecuador's president to skip Summit of the Americas|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/03/us-ecuador-correa-summit-idUSBRE83200U20120403|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=14 April 2012|date=2 April 2012}}</ref> Nicaraguan President [[Daniel Ortega]] was also absent from the summit over the issue of Cuba's exclusion saying: "It's not a favor anyone would be doing to Cuba. It's a right they've had taken away from them."<ref name=preconcl>{{cite web|title=US scandal and Cuba dominate Americas summit|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/04/201241515440716212.html|work=Al Jazeera|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]] also ridiculed the summit for not featuring Cuba saying: "If the United States and Canada, refuse to discuss issues so profoundly unifying in Latin America like the issue of Cuba, the solidarity with Cuba or the issue of the Malvinas Islands, why else have the Summit of the Americas?" Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]] said that "we have arrived with the conviction that this must be the last summit without Cuba."<ref name="Al Jazeera 2012-04-14 1" />

Due to illness, Chavez was unsure if he would attend the summit.<ref>{{cite news|last=De La Rosa|first=Alicia|title=Chavez: I'm not sure if I will attend the Summit of the Americas|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/120413/chavez-im-not-sure-if-i-will-attend-the-summit-of-the-americas|accessdate=14 April 2012|newspaper=El Universal|date=11 April 2012}}</ref> Argenitinean President [[Cristina Kirchner]] left in the morning of 15 April, before the summit was officially closed<Ref name="arg"/> over the issue of the Falklands Islands. Morales also left early after having said on 14 April that "all the countries here in Latin American and the Caribbean want Cuba to be present. But the United States won't accept [it]. It's like a dictatorship."<Ref name="close"/>

==Apolitical reactions==
Alex Main of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] suggested that Obama's claims in the [[5th Summit of the Americas]] to start a "new chapter" in the United States' hemispheric relations would be undone by following the past practices of his predecessor [[George W. Bush]] as he could call on the Colombian and Panamanian [[free trade agreement]] and offer reform to [[Cuba<U+2013>United States relations]], including having the country participate at the [[7th Summit of the Americas]]. He also suggested other government's in Central America, led by the right-winged government of Guatemala's [[Otto Perez Molina]], would call for a debate on the legalisation of drugs in a bid to stem the tide in the War on Drugs, which would be a difficult prospect for a U.S. president facing an [[United States presidential election, 2012|election]]. He concluded in saying that there could be a firmer view that the "Summit of the Americas has become an archaic instrument of US policy" due to the lack of reform in the U.S.' direction in hemispheric relations whereas the rest of the region has moved towards [[Latin American integration]] with such moved as the formation of multilateral bodies such as [[Mercosur]], [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]], [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]] and [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States|CELAC]] to counteract the OAS in its exclusion of the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|last=Main|first=Alex|title=Obama in Cartagena: No change, dwindling hope|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/04/201241272337682401.html|work=Alex Main|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=14 April 2012|format=13 April 2012}}</ref> Adam Isacson of the [[Washington Office on Latin America]] said of the waning influence of the summit that "the label 'Americas' doesn't seem to mean that much anymore unless you're a cartographer."<Ref name="close"/>
