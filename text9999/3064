'''''The World Without Us''''' is a non-fiction book about what would happen to the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]] if humans suddenly disappeared, written by [[United States|American]] journalist [[Alan Weisman]] and published by [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Weisman |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Weisman |title=The World Without Us |date=[[July 10]], [[2007]] |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0312347294 |oclc=122261590}}</ref> It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' article "Earth Without People".<ref name=EWP>{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Weisman |publication-date=February 2005 |title=Earth Without People |periodical=Discover Magazine |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=60&ndash;65 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/feb/earth-without-people/ |accessdate=[[November 10]], [[2007]]}}.</ref> Written largely as a [[thought experiment]], it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, [[bronze]] statues, [[plastics]], and [[Mount Rushmore]] will be among the longest lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.

The author of four previous books and numerous articles for magazines, Weisman traveled around the world to interview academics, scientists and other authorities. He used quotes from these interviews to explain the effects of the natural environment and to substantiate predictions. The book has been translated and published in France, Germany, Portugal and Spain. It was successful in the U.S., reaching #6 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]<ref name=NYTBSsept9>{{Citation |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/bestseller/0909besthardnonfiction.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction |accessdate=[[November 2]], [[2007]] |date=[[September 9]], [[2007]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}.</ref> and #1 on the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' Best-Sellers list in September 2007.<ref name=SFC>{{Citation |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/23/RV0SS7TK4.DTL&hw=world+without+us&sn=004&sc=995 |title=San Francisco Chronicle Best-Sellers: Nonfiction Bay Area |accessdate=[[November 2]], [[2007]] |date=[[September 23]], [[2007]] |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}.</ref> It ranked #1 on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s'' {{nowrap|top 10 non-fiction books}} of 2007. The book has received largely positive reviews, specifically for Weisman's journalistic and scientific writing style, but some have questioned the relevance of its subject matter.

==Background==
Before ''The World Without Us'', the author, [[Alan Weisman]], had previously written four books, including ''[[Gaviotas]]: A Village to Reinvent the World'' in 1998 on an eco-village in Colombia, and ''An Echo In My Blood'' in 1999 on his family<U+2019>s history immigrating from Ukraine to the United States. He has worked as an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers and at the time of writing was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the [[University of Arizona]]. The position required him to teach only one class in the spring semester, and he was free to travel and conduct research the rest of the year.<ref>{{Citation |last=Williams |first=Wilda |date=[[May 15]], [[2007]] |title=The Lonely Planet |periodical=[[Library Journal]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |volume=132 |issue=9 |pages=112 |issn=0363-0277}}.</ref>

The idea for ''The World Without Us'' was suggested to Weisman in 2003 by Josie Glausiusz, an editor at ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''.<ref name=pg277>Weisman (2007), 277.</ref> She asked him to write an article expanding on the ideas presented in his 1994 ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' article "Journey through a Doomed Land" about the state of [[Chernobyl]] eight years after abandonment.<ref name=pg277/> His ''Discover'' article, "Earth Without People", published in the February 2005 issue and re-printed in ''The Best American Science Writing 2006'' anthology,<ref>{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Weisman |date=February 2005 |publication-date=[[September 5]], [[2006]] |contribution=Earth Without People |editor-last=Gawande |editor-first=Atul |editor-link=Atul Gawande |editor2-last=Cohen |editor2-first=Jesse |title=The Best American Science Writing |edition=2006 |publication-place=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial |pages=28&ndash;36 |isbn=9780060726447}}.</ref> describes how nature has thrived in the abandoned [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] and how nature would overwhelm the [[built environment]] of [[New York City]].<ref name=EWP/> Using interviews with [[Paleoecology|paleoecologists]], the article speculates that [[megafauna]] would return and that forest cover, like the [[Bia<U+0142>owie<U+017C>a Forest]], would spread over Europe and the [[eastern United States]]. The article raises the prospect of failing power plants, chemical plants, dams, and petroleum tanks.

To expand this into a book Weisman<U+2019>s agent found an editor and publisher at [[St. Martin's Press]]. Among the 23 page bibliography are two articles he wrote for the [[Los Angeles Times Magazine]] ("Naked Planet" on persistent organic pollutants, and "The Real Indiana Jones" on the [[Mayan civilization]]) and one published in the ''[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Traveler]]'' ("Diamond in the Wild" on diamond mining), as well as ''Discover'''s "Earth Without People".<ref>Weisman (2007), 289&ndash;311.</ref> Additional research saw Weisman travel to England, Cyprus, Turkey, Panama, and Kenya.

==Synopsis==
The book is divided into 19 chapters, with a prelude, coda, bibliography, and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, like the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written from the point of view of a [[science journalist]] with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.<ref name=Weiler>{{Citation |last=Weiler |first=Derek |publication-date=[[August 12]], [[2007]] |title=And the wild things shall inherit the Earth |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/245456 |accessdate=[[October 31]], [[2007]]}}</ref><ref name=Appleton>{{Citation |last=Appleton |first=Josie |date=July 2007 |title=Unleashing nature<U+2019>s terror |publisher=[[Spiked (magazine)]]|issue=3 |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/reviewofbooks_article/3628/ |accessdate=[[December 4]], [[2007]]}}.</ref>

Weisman's thought experiment pursues two themes: how would nature react to the disappearance of humans and what legacy would humans leave behind? To foresee how other life could continue without humans Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the Bia<U+0142>owie<U+017C>a Forest, the [[Kingman Reef]], and the [[Palmyra Atoll]]. He interviews biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] and visits with members of the [[Korean Federation for Environmental Movement]] at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] where few humans have penetrated since 1953.<ref>Weisman (2007), 183&ndash;188.</ref> He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that "we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors".<ref>Weisman (2007), 232.</ref> Several chapters are dedicated to [[megafauna]], which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and implications for climatic change are likewise examined.

With material from previous articles, Weisman uses the fate of the [[Mayan civilization]] to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence.<ref>Weisman (2007), 223&ndash;8.</ref> To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the [[Panama Canal]], where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams.<ref>Weisman (2007), 173&ndash;178.</ref> Illustrating abandoned cities succumbing to nature Weisman reports from [[Chernobyl|Chernobyl, Ukraine]], and [[Varosha (Famagusta)|Varosha, Cyprus]], abandoned in 1986 and 1974, respectively. Weisman finds their structures crumbling as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing [[Istanbul]], as typical for large cities in lesser developed countries, with the [[underground cities]] at [[Cappadocia]]. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster.<ref>Weisman (2007), 103&ndash;105.</ref> Cappadocia was built thousands of years ago out of volcanic [[tuff]], and is likely to survive for centuries to come.<ref>Weisman (2007), 106&ndash;111.</ref>

Weisman uses [[New York City]] as a model to outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He explains that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave-in. From interviews with members of the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]]<ref>Weisman (2007), 22&ndash;24.</ref> and the [[New York Botanical Gardens]]<ref>Weisman (2007), 28&ndash;32.</ref> Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth rats and cockroaches would die off.

Weisman explains that a common house would begin to fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles.<ref>Weisman (2007), 18.</ref> The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the [[Pioneer plaque]]s, the [[Voyager Golden Record]], and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.<ref>Weisman (2007), 249&ndash;254.</ref>

Breaking from the theme of the natural environment after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete [[human extinction|demise of humans]] without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers [[transhumanism]], the [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]], and [[John A. Leslie]]'s ''The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction''.<ref>Weisman (2007), 239&ndash;244.</ref> Weisman concludes the book considering a new version of the [[one-child policy]]. While he admits it is a "draconian measure",<ref>Weisman (2007), 272.</ref> he states, "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder."<ref name=WaPo>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/07/27/DI2007072701908.html |title=Book World |accessdate=2007-11-11
|author=Alan Weisman |coauthors=Callum Roberts |date=[[July 31]], [[2007]] |format=Interview |publisher=The Washington Post Company}}</ref> He responded to criticism of this saying "I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too".<ref name=WaPo/>

Pete Garceau designed the cover art for the American release, which one critic said was "a thick layer of sugar-coated sweetness in an effort to not alarm potential readers. 'Yes, I am a book about the environment. But I'm harmless! No, really!'&nbsp;"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6470045.html |title=Jackets Required: The World Without Us |author=Fwis |accessdate=2007-11-11 |date=[[August 21]], [[2007]] |publisher=Publishers Weekly}}</ref> The Canadian version, designed by Ellen Cipriano, is similar to the American version but with a photo illustration rather than the disarming cartoon illustration.

Several critics found the lack of an anthropomorphic point of view to hurt the book's relevance.<ref name=Long/> Robert Braile in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that it has "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [Weisman's] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating".<ref name=Braile>{{Citation | last=Braile | first=Robert | publication-date= [[August 18]], [[2007]] | title=He imagines a world without people.

The book's environmental focus was also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of ''[[The American Spectator]]'' wrote that it is "a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens".<ref>{{cite web | last=Orlet | first=Christopher| date= [[August 1]], [[2007]] | title=Better Off Dead |publisher= ''[[The American Spectator]]'' |url= http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11813| accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref> Braile agrees that the book could be "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people".<ref name=Braile/> Environmentalist [[Alex Steffen]] found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007046.html |title=The World With Us |accessdate=2007-12-20 |author=[[Alex Steffen]] |date=[[July 23]], [[2007]] |work=[[Worldchanging]]}}</ref> Two critics who call the book a "[[Jeremiad]]" ultimately gave it a positive review.<ref name=Kamiya/><ref>{{Citation |last=Heinegg |first=Peter |date= [[September 15]], [[2007]] |title=The World Without Us |periodical=[[America (magazine)|America]] |publisher=America Press |volume=197 |issue=16 |pages=23 |issn=0002-7049}}.</ref> 

Other critics hailed the environmental perspective. Chauncey Mabe of the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' calls the book "one of the most satisfying environmental books of recent memory, one devoid of self-righteousness, alarmism or tiresome doomsaying".<ref>{{Citation | last=Mabe | first=Chauncey |date= [[August 12]], [[2007]] | title='The World Without Us' by Alan Weisman: Don't think about us when we're gone | newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07224/808312-148.stm| accessdate=[[November 1]], [[2007]]}}.</ref> Tom Spears of the [[CanWest News Service]] concludes "it's more a portrait of ourselves, taken through an odd lens" and "[s]ometimes an obituary is the best biography".<ref>{{Citation | last=Spears| first=Tom | date= [[September 02]], [[2007]] | title=World would go on without us: New book looks at what would happen without people | publisher=[[CanWest News Service]]| newspaper=[[The Province]] |url= http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=0146ef3d-9418-4bca-9922-7d211095aecd| accessdate=[[November 1]], [[2007]]}}.</ref>

==Genre==
A non-fiction [[List of environmental books|environmental book]], ''The World Without Us'' is grounded in [[Environmental journalism|environmental]] and [[science journalism]]. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet.<ref name=Lynas>{{Citation | last=Lynas| first=Mark| author-link=Mark Lynas |date= [[September 27]], [[2007]] | title=Back to the future |publisher =[[New Statesman]]|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/200709270042 |accessdate=[[December 4]], [[2007]] |pages=53<U+2013>54}}.</ref> Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which "throw[s] the spotlight on the earth itself,"<ref name=Kamiya/> was found to be creative and objective.<ref name=Weiler/>

Weisman's approach to the environmental genre was said to leave no relevant message, only trivia, because the findings deal only with a future after humans. Addressing his approach, Weisman said that eliminating the human element eliminated the "fear factor" that people are doing something wrong or that they will die; it is meant to be read as a fantasy, according to the author.<ref name=powell/> Josie Appleton of ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' related the book to "today<U+2019>s romanticisation of nature" in that it linked "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed.<ref name=Appleton/> Appleton also felt the book countered the "Nature knows best" notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.<ref name=Appleton/>

Weisman's science journalism style uses interviews with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, while maintaining the "cool and dispassionate [tone]<U+2026>of a scientific observer rather than an activist".<ref name=Weiler/> Weisman said he purposely avoided the [[activist]] label: "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for whatever it is you believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it."<ref name=powell>{{cite interview | subject=Alan Weisman | subjectlink =Alan Weisman |interviewer= Dave Weich| title = With People out of the Picture, Alan Weisman Gets Creative |url= http://www.powells.com/authors/alanweisman.html | program = [[Powell's Books|Powells.com]] |city= Portland |date= [[July 19]], [[2007]] | accessdate = 2007-11-10}}</ref> [[Richard Fortey]] compares the book to the works of [[Jared Diamond]], [[Tim Flannery]] and [[E.O. Wilson]], and writes that ''The World Without Us'' "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity".<ref>{{Citation | last=Fortey | first=Richard |author-link=Richard Fortey| publication-date= [[August 16]], [[2007]] |title= How would Nature clean up our mess? | newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]]| publication-place =London |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/08/16/boweis112.xml |accessdate=[[December 4]], [[2007]]}}.</ref> [[Mark Lynas]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' noted that "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, ''The World Without Us'' seems refreshingly positive".<ref name=Lynas/> Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying "if the planet can recover from the [[Permian<U+2013>Triassic extinction event|Permian]], it can recover from the human".<ref name=Appleton/>
