"'''Through the Rain'''" is a song performed by singer [[Mariah Carey]]. It was composed and written by Carey and [[Lionel Cole]] for her ninth studio album ''[[Charmbracelet]]'' (2002), and it was released as the album's first single in 2002.
The song speaks of having faith that one will overcome any turmoil or obstacle (rain)and will persevere throughout any situation. The song is arranged in a typical order with verse one, chorus, verse two, bridge and chorus. Carey uses her long signature high note to link the bridge to the final chorus.

==Release and reception==
The song topped the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and reached number 81 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

"Through the Rain" was remixed by [[Hex Hector]] and Mac Quayle (HQ2), [[Maurice Joshua]], [[Full Intention]], and [[Boris Dlugosch]] and Michi Lange (Boris & Michi). The song was used in Japan as the ending theme for the 2003 live-action TV adaptation of [[K<U+014D>suke Fujishima]]'s [[manga]] ''[[You're Under Arrest! (manga)|You're Under Arrest!]]''.

==Music video==
The music video, directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]], was filmed on location in [[New York City]]. It is based on the courtship and eloping of Carey's parents, Alfred and Patricia Carey ([[J. D. Williams]] and [[Jamie-Lynn Sigler]]) and incorporates themes from ''Charmbracelet'' as well as from Carey's life. Carey is seen singing in the street when rain starts to fall while being juxtaposed with a couple escaping from their family who strongly opposes the mixed race relationship and eloping. In the bridge of the song Carey ends the scene with a long note taking the scene to a church were she belts out the chorus in front of a church assembly. Carey then touches the charm bracelet on her wrist and looks at a couple, assuming to be her parents. The couple is then shown to be the same one from earlier in the video.

There are existing 2 remix videos using the ''Hex Hector Club Mix'' and the ''Hex Hector/Mac Quayle Club Mix''
