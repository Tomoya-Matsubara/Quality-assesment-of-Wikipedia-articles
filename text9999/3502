[[General (Australia)|General]] '''Sir John Gordon Noel Wilton''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|KBE|CB|DSO}} (22 November 1910 <U+2013> 10&nbsp;May 1981) was a senior commander in the [[Australian Army]]. He served as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS), the Army's highest-ranking position, from 1963 until 1966, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], from 1966 until 1970. His eight-year tenure as Australia's senior Army officer covered almost the entire period of the nation's [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|involvement in the Vietnam War]].

Born in [[Sydney]], Wilton entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1927. Owing to lack of opportunity in the Australian military at the time, he was commissioned into the [[British Army]] following his graduation in 1930. He served most of the remainder of the decade with the [[Royal Artillery]] in India. Wilton returned to Australia on the eve of World War&nbsp;II and was commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. He saw action with the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th&nbsp;Division]] in [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syria]] and the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] in [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]], earning a [[mention in despatches]] in the former campaign and the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in the latter.  Finishing the war a temporary [[colonel]], he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1947. Wilton was posted to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1953 to take command of the [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Commonwealth Brigade]], leading it in its final action of the war at the [[Battle of the Samichon River]]. He was raised to [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] and awarded the US [[Legion of Merit]] for his performance in Korea.

Wilton was promoted to [[major general]] in 1957 and became Commandant of Duntroon. He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1962 and made CGS the following January, with the rank of [[lieutenant general]]. As CGS he oversaw a reorganisation of the Army<U+2019>s divisional structure, the reintroduction of conscription, and deployments during the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia ''Konfrontasi'']] and the Vietnam War. Knighted in 1964, he handed over the position of CGS in May 1966 and was appointed CCOSC. In this role he worked to achieve an integrated defence organisation, including a tri-services academy, a joint intelligence division, and the amalgamation of separate government departments for the Army, [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force|Air Force]], all of which were eventually realised. Wilton was promoted to [[general]] in September 1968, and retired from the military in November 1970. He served as [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]] to the United States in 1973<U+2013>75, and died in 1981, aged seventy.

==Early career==
John Wilton was born in [[Sydney]] on 22&nbsp;November 1910, the second of two sons to English migrants Noel and Muriel Wilton. Noel was an electrical engineer, and moved with his family to [[Hobart]] in 1915 to take up employment with the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Department.<ref name=ADB>{{cite web|last=Horner|first=David|authorlink=David Horner|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/wilton-sir-john-gordon-noel-15765|title=Wilton, Sir John Gordon Noel (1910<U+2013>1981)|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 1<U+2013>3</ref> Attending various schools, John and his brother Maurice lived in Sydney for a time with Muriel following their parents' separation in 1917, before Noel brought them back to Hobart in 1921.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 5</ref> In 1923 he moved with them to [[Grafton]], New South Wales, where he managed the Clarence River County Council.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 7</ref> <!--His divorce from Muriel came through the same year, and he married Mary (Mollie) Gaffney, the union producing three half-sisters for Maurice and John.--> John attended [[Grafton High School]], where he attained his [[leaving certificate]].<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 8<U+2013>10</ref> <!--Muriel also remarried, and gave the Wilton boys another half-sister.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 11</ref>--> Considered by family to be a "loner", "a clear thinker", and a "quite, determined, achiever", he entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in February 1927, aged sixteen.<ref name=ADB/><ref name="Commanders 318">McNeill, "General Sir John Wilton", pp. 318<U+2013>319</ref> Early on he was subjected to the usual [[hazing|bastardisation]] handed out to younger cadets by seniors, but was not known to inflict the same treatment on juniors once he reached the senior class. Although somewhat aloof from his fellows, he did well in team sports such as rugby and hockey, as well as swimming and diving.<ref name="Commanders 318"/> Second academically in his class of twelve, Wilton graduated from Duntroon on 9&nbsp;December 1930.<ref name="Age">{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert O'Neill|title=Wilton, quiet, courageous leader of men|work=[[The Age]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ETRVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w5QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3973%2C5861559|page=13|date=12 May 1981|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

By 1930, the effects of the [[Great Depression]] had reduced the opportunities for Duntroon graduates.<ref name="Commanders 318"/> Only four of Wilton's classmates joined the [[Australian Military Forces]], while four transferred to the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and four to the [[British Army]]. Wilton was among the last-mentioned, taking a commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Artillery]], with seniority from 22&nbsp;November 1930.<ref name="Age"/><ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=33701 |startpage=1988 |date=24 March 1931 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> Seeking active duty, he requested a posting to India, and sailed with the [[6th (Howitzer) Brigade Royal Field Artillery|6th Field Brigade]] to [[Bombay]] in November 1931.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref> He spent the next three years based at [[Faizabad|Fyzabad]], near the Nepalese border. Promoted to [[lieutenant]] in November 1933, he undertook training and exercises with his battery, and learned to speak [[Urdu]], but saw no action.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 29, 33<U+2013>35</ref> In February 1935 he was posted to Burma, joining the 10th ([[Abbottabad]]) Battery of the Indian Mountain Artillery at [[Pyin U Lwin|Maymyo]], near [[Mandalay]].<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 36<U+2013>38</ref> According to biographer [[David Horner]], Wilton's "first taste of excitement" was in April 1935, when he joined the hunt for a rogue tiger and shot the animal as it attacked and mauled one of his companions.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 39<U+2013>40</ref>  In November he saw operational service with his unit in skirmishes with local tribesmen in the [[Wa State]] of northern Burma, on the Chinese border.<ref name="Commanders 318"/><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 40<U+2013>43</ref>

After eight months extended leave in 1936, and a posting to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps, Wilton briefly returned to Australia to marry Helen Marshall on 9&nbsp;July 1938 at St. Andrew's Church in [[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]], New South Wales.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 45<U+2013>49</ref> John had met Helen, then a nurse, on a double date in Sydney while he was in his last year at Duntroon; the couple had two sons and a daughter.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 20</ref> On the same trip home he was invited to transfer to the Australian military, and accepted.<ref name="Commanders 318"/> Promoted to [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] in December 1938, Wilton saw out his British service with a coastal battery in [[Karachi]], and was commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Artillery]] on 26&nbsp;May 1939.<ref name=ADB/><ref name="Commanders 318"/> His service with the British Army on the subcontinent had afforded him regimental experience that he could never have gained in Australia, as well as an understanding of mountainous and tropical conditions that would benefit him in years to come.<ref name="Age"/><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 36, 47</ref>

==World War II==

Wilton spent a year in coastal artillery posts at [[Sydney Heads|North Head]] and [[Port Kembla (New South Wales)|Port Kembla]] in Sydney before transferring to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]].<ref name="Commanders 319">McNeill, "General Sir John Wilton", pp. 319<U+2013>321</ref> He was promoted [[major]] on 7&nbsp;May 1940 and given command of a battery in the [[2/4th Field Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Field Regiment]], part of the recently formed [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], which embarked for the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in October.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 55<U+2013>57</ref> On the voyage he wrote his wife a letter in case he was killed, admonishing: "Remember what has always been our motto<U+2014>nothing can defeat us<U+2014>not even death!"<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 58</ref> Appointed the division's [[Brigade Major]] Royal Artillery on 19&nbsp;March 1941, Wilton served under Brigadier [[Frank Berryman]] in the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syrian campaign]], and was responsible for coordinating operations during the [[Battle of Merdjayoun]] in June.<ref name="Age"/><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 60, 66<U+2013>67</ref>  Assigned to the staff of Headquarters [[I Corps (Australia)|I&nbsp;Corps]], Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade&nbsp;2 (Artillery) on 1&nbsp;November; this would be the final artillery posting of his career.<ref name="Dennis">Dennis et al, ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 603<U+2013>604</ref><ref name=Horner69>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref> He was promoted to temporary [[lieutenant colonel]] on 25&nbsp;November.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=Horner69/> On 30&nbsp;December, Wilton was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his service with the 7th&nbsp;Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1516574/?query=&section%5B0%5D=people&op=Search&filter%5Brcdb_id%5D=345481 |title=Award: Mention in Despatches|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=35396 |startpage=7358|date=30 December 1941|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> He entered the Middle East Staff School at [[Haifa]] in January 1942, and graduated in May.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 71</ref>

Returning to Australia, Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade&nbsp;1 in Major General [[Stanley Savige]]'s [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd&nbsp;Division]] in August 1942.<ref name=ADB/> Savige later recalled that "I never had a more competent staff, nor such a co-operative team, than that staff after Wilton came along."<ref>Keating, ''The Right Man for the Right Job'', p. 87</ref> The 3rd&nbsp;Division was part of Lieutenant General [[Edmund Herring]]'s [[II Corps (Australia)|II&nbsp;Corps]]. In October, Herring succeeded Lieutenant General [[Sydney Rowell]] as commander of [[New Guinea Force]], and Savige became acting corps commander. With his attention focused on the corps, Savige relied on Wilton to supervise the training of the 3rd&nbsp;Division.<ref>Keating, ''The Right Man for the Right Job'', pp. 86<U+2013>89</ref> Wilton travelled to New Guinea in February 1943 to reconnoitre the terrain and begin plans for the division's forthcoming [[Salamaua<U+2013>Lae campaign|campaign in Salamaua]].<ref name=ADB/> He was attached to [[Kanga Force]] in [[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]] during March 1943, prior to its absorption by 3rd&nbsp;Division the following month.<ref>Dexter, [https://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070175--1-.pdf ''The New Guinea Offensives'', p. 26]</ref> Herring had ordered that the 3rd&nbsp;Division "threaten" [[Salamaua]], and despite Wilton's attempts to clarify precisely what this meant, the order remained vague. Savige and Wilton interpreted it as meaning that the 3rd&nbsp;Division was to capture Salamaua, when in fact its main purpose in the campaign was to divert Japanese forces from [[Lae]].<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 96</ref> In the event, 3rd&nbsp;Division progressed steadily and by August it had to be ordered to slow down so that Lae could be attacked before Salamaua.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 111</ref>  Wilton received much of the credit for 3rd&nbsp;Division's performance.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 112<U+2013>113</ref> He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for his "skill and ability in New Guinea" between July 1942 and April 1943, the citation being promulgated on 27&nbsp;April 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068964/RCDIG1068964--180-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Distinguished Service Order|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=36486 |supp=yes |startpage=1927 |date=25 April 1944 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

In September 1943, following his service with 3rd&nbsp;Division, Wilton was posted to Washington, D.C. as General Staff Officer Australian Military Mission; he spent November and December 1944 in Europe, observing the Allies' military organisation.<ref name="Commanders 319"/> He was promoted temporary [[colonel]] in May 1945, and appointed to the General Staff Advanced Headquarters Australian Military Force, [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], based at [[Morotai]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and, later, [[Manila]] in the [[Philippines]].<ref name=ADB/><ref name="Commanders 319"/> Wilton was honoured for his "highly meritorious service" throughout the war with appointment as an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) on 6&nbsp;March 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068964/RCDIG1068964--181-.JPG |title=Recommendation: Officer of the Order of the British Empire|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=37898 |supp=yes |startpage=1085|endpage=1086|date=4 March 1947 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

==Post-war career==
===Rise to senior command===
Wilton was still only a substantive captain at the end of hostilities, but was considered by the Military Board to be among those "promising officers who have forced their way to the top during the war" and hence to deserve retention of their wartime rank.<ref>Grey, ''The Australian Army'', p. 167</ref> He became Deputy Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters (AHQ), Melbourne, in March 1946, and took charge of the same directorate a year later.<ref name="Commanders 319"/> By now promoted to substantive colonel, in 1950 he was a member of the [[William Bridgeford|Bridgeford Mission]], which advised the Australian government on the state of the [[Malayan Emergency]].<ref>Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', pp. 45<U+2013>47</ref> On a visit to Singapore in February<U+2013>March 1951 as part of a joint planning team, he urged his British counterparts to maintain their presence in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] as the basis of a combined force, without which Australia would be reluctant to commit any troops for the region's security.<ref>O'Neill, ''Strategy and Diplomacy'', pp. 227<U+2013>228</ref>  Relinquishing his post at AHQ in November 1951, Wilton attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in London during 1952, and was promoted to [[brigadier]] on 13&nbsp;March 1953.<ref name="Commanders 319"/><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. 143</ref> <!--"Formally took command" of 28BGE on 25 March.Horner 149--> Later that month he was given a combat command in the [[Korean War]], taking over the [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Commonwealth Brigade]] from fellow Duntroon graduate Brigadier [[Thomas Joseph Daly|Thomas Daly]].<ref name="Age"/><ref name="Commanders 316">McNeill, "General Sir John Wilton", pp. 316<U+2013>317</ref>

The 28th was described in the [[Australia in the Korean War 1950<U+2013>53|official history of Australia's involvement in the Korean War]] as "the most nationally diverse" brigade in the [[1st Commonwealth Division]], consisting of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand units, yet also "an outstandingly well-knit formation".<ref>O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', pp. 239<U+2013>240</ref> After operating on the eastern side of the [[Jamestown Line]] from April, the 28th was transferred westward to relieve the [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th Brigade]] at [[Battle of the Samichon River|the Hook]], the Commonwealth Division's most vulnerable position, on 9<U+2013>10 July.<ref>O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', pp. 220, 274<U+2013>275</ref> The brigade's last action took place shortly before the end of the war, when it used artillery, mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire to repulse a heavy night-time attack by Chinese troops.<ref name="Commanders 316"/><ref>O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', p. 282</ref> Wilton later recalled the "terrible and gruesome sight" of no-man's land "literally carpeted with dead bodies".<ref name="Commanders 316"/> At 6:15am on 23&nbsp;July he informed his battalion chiefs that an armistice was ready to be signed, and to keep patrols to the minimum level necessary for the line's security.<ref>O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', p. 278</ref> He was present for the armistice ceremony at [[Panmunjom]] four days later.<ref>O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', p. 281</ref> Having succeeded in maintaining his command's discipline and morale during a potentially problematic time at the end of the conflict and the beginning of peace, he handed over the 28th to Brigadier [[Ian Thomas Murdoch|Ian Murdoch]] on 19&nbsp;February 1954.<ref>O'Neill, ''Combat Operations'', pp. 588<U+2013>590</ref> For his service in Korea, Wilton was raised to [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] on 10&nbsp;June 1954.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=40193 |supp=yes |startpage=3307 |date=10 June 1954|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>  He was also awarded the US [[Legion of Merit]] for his "outstanding leadership and initiative" directing the brigade; the decoration was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 1&nbsp;May 1956.<ref name=ADB/><ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=40766 |supp=yes |startpage=2543 |date=1 May 1956 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

After returning to Australia, Wilton was appointed Brigadier in Charge of Administration at Headquarters Eastern Command, his first administrative post. In November 1955 he was assigned to the General Staff at AHQ, where he was responsible for intelligence, operations and plans, and took part in Australian preparations for [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] exercises. He was promoted to [[major general]] on 24&nbsp;March 1957, and became Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon.<ref name="Commanders 322">McNeill, "General Sir John Wilton", p. 322</ref> In 1959 he personally launched an appeal for public funds to build the College's Anzac Memorial Chapel, which would open in 1966.<ref>Moore, ''Duntroon'', pp. 224<U+2013>225</ref> Another of his goals was to see the college grant tertiary degrees to cadets; this was realised in 1968.<ref name=ADB/> From June 1960 through 1962, Wilton was Chief of the Military Planning Office at SEATO Headquarters, [[Bangkok]].<ref name="Commanders 322"/><ref name="Grey">Grey, ''The Australian Army'', p. 209</ref> He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=42684 |startpage=4343 |date=25 May 1962 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> On 21&nbsp;January 1963, Wilton was promoted [[lieutenant general]] and became [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS), succeeding [[Reginald Pollard|Sir Reginald Pollard]].<ref name="Grey"/><ref name="Dennis 612">Dennis et al, ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 612<U+2013>613</ref> He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in the 1964 [[New Year Honours]].<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=43201 |supp=yes |startpage=36 |date=31 December 1963 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

===Chief of the General Staff===
Following the lead of the US Army, in 1960 the Australian Army had replaced its former "triangular" divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters, with a "pentropic" divisional organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer in between. This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions, while increasing their individual strength.<ref>Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 204<U+2013>205</ref> Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure, reasoning that the number of battalions, rather than their relative strength, was the overriding factor when considering the Army's potential overseas deployments at this time. The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961. In October 1964, Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation.<ref name="Grey"/><ref>Dennis et al, ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp. 419<U+2013>420</ref> In the meantime, as a response to the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia  ''Konfrontasi'']], the Australian government reintroduced conscription, which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was not going to improve pay and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments.<ref>Grey, ''The Australian Army'', pp. 209<U+2013>210</ref> Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might have against the regular soldiery, and vice versa; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that "it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier", he wrote on it "This assumption not justified".<ref>McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', p. 28</ref> By March 1965, the government had despatched 1&nbsp;Squadron, [[Special Air Service Regiment]], and [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], to [[Borneo]].<ref name=ADB/><ref>Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', p. 237</ref>

[[File:RAAF UH-1D of 9 Sqn in Vietnam 1970.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.28|UH-1 Iroquois of No.&nbsp;9 Squadron RAAF in Vietnam|alt=Military helicopter with main door open, over jungle]]
By mid-1964, the Commonwealth had already sent a small team of military advisors, plus a detachment of newly acquired [[De Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|DHC-4 Caribou]] transports, to Indochina at the request of the [[South Vietnam]]ese government.<ref>Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', pp. 300<U+2013>306</ref>  The [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], was deployed in May 1965.<ref>Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', pp. 310<U+2013>312</ref> At around the same time, Wilton recommended to his opposite number in the RAAF, Air Marshal [[Alister Murdoch|Sir Alister Murdoch]], the despatch of two [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. He was exasperated when Murdoch rejected the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact that two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation. The Australian government eventually overrode Murdoch, and [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]]'s UH-1s were in action in Vietnam less than a year later.<ref name="Solo">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 289<U+2013>292</ref><ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', p. 141</ref>

Wilton supported the RAAF's request that the deputy commander of Australian Forces Vietnam be an air officer, despite the misgivings of some senior Army personnel and the fact that such a senior appointment was not commensurate with the services' relative commitments to the conflict. In what the official history of Australia in the Vietnam War described as a "pragmatic and far-sighted approach", Wilton expressed his hope that such an arrangement would give the Air Force a closer understanding of land/air cooperation, and avoid "increasing differences of views about strategic and tactical concepts with the Australian Armed Forces".<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 79<U+2013>81, 83</ref> Following the Federal government's decision in March 1966 to despatch a [[1st Australian Task Force|task force of two battalions]] to Vietnam, Wilton negotiated with US and South Vietnamese commanders a self-contained operations area for the Australian troops, in [[Ph<U+01B0><U+1EDB>c Tuy Province]], where they could operate with a reasonable degree of independence and security.<ref name=ADB/><ref name="Commanders 327">McNeill, "General Sir John Wilton", p. 327</ref> He rejected a mobile role for the Australians that would have placed them under the control of a US division because, he believed, "their operations became a bit of a meat grinder" with "tremendous casualties".<ref>McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', pp. 200<U+2013>201</ref> On 19&nbsp;May 1966, Wilton took over from Air Chief Marshal [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), a role predating that of the modern [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]].<ref name="Commanders 328">McNeill, "General Sir John Wilton", p. 328</ref><ref name="CDF">{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/CDF/PreviousChiefs.asp |title=Chief of the Defence Force|publisher= [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> He was succeeded as CGS by Lieutenant General Daly.<ref name="Commanders 328"/> According to the official history of the Vietnam War, the timing of the handover was "especially significant" as it "coincided with the change in Vietnam from an Army force which was responsible to the Chief of the General Staff to a combined force responsive to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee. Wilton, therefore, carried through his responsibilities concerning the Vietnam commitment to his new appointment."<ref>McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', p. 205</ref>

===Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee===
====Vietnam====
Wilton accepted the [[domino theory]] and never wavered in his commitment to Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the [[North Vietnam|the north]].<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. XV, XIX, 279</ref> Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated the deployment of a [[Centurion tank]] squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase the strength of the task force in Vietnam, but in the end both commitments were announced in October 1967. Wilton also resisted suggestions to rotate the Australian task force out of Ph<U+01B0><U+1EDB>c Tuy, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people.<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 286<U+2013>287</ref> He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier [[Ronald Lawrence Hughes|Ronald Hughes]], when the latter was criticised at home for conducting "American style operations" outside the immediate vicinity of Ph<U+01B0><U+1EDB>c Tuy, such as the set-piece [[Battle of Coral<U+2013>Balmoral|battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral]] in mid-1968.<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 402, 410</ref> Wilton was promoted to [[General (Australia)|general]] on 1&nbsp;September that year, the first Australian officer to attain the rank since [[Thomas Blamey]], twenty-seven years previously.<ref name="Strategic Command XIV">Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. XIV, 289</ref>

US troop reductions in 1969 under President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Vietnamization]] policy led to increasing demands for similar withdrawals of Australian troops.  Wilton, Daly and other senior officers argued that that the "balanced" nature of the Australian task force would be damaged by a piecemeal withdrawal and that the only valid form of reduction would be "one out, all out"; in the event, a phased withdrawal took place, one battalion leaving in October 1970, and the other two in October and December 1971.<ref>Edwards, ''A Nation at War'', pp. 202<U+2013>204</ref><ref>Ekins; McNeill, ''Fighting to the Finish'', pp. xxxv<U+2013>xxxvi</ref>  The divisive nature of the war caused conflict within Wilton's own family; all his children actively opposed it, and in September 1969 his son Robert publicly burnt his draft deferment notice outside [[Parliament House, Canberra]], having earlier called upon students at the [[Australian National University]] not to register for national service. ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' ran an article on the Parliament House incident, complete with a photograph of Robert burning his notice. As Australia's senior soldier, Wilton refused to comment on the situation; Robert reported that he and his father respected one another's viewpoints, and relations within the family remained amicable.<ref>Edwards, ''A Nation at War'', pp. 212<U+2013>213</ref><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. XX</ref>

One of the most controversial aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Ph<U+01B0><U+1EDB>c Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the [[Viet Cong]], he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was "better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was "the biggest blunder" Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was "like being wise after the event".<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 127<U+2013>129</ref><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', 328<U+2013>330</ref>

====Joint defence aspirations====
Wilton's position as CCOSC had no statutory authority over the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam. David Horner noted that in an emergency situation, Wilton "had to issue directives and then seek retrospective endorsement of them by either the minister or the Chiefs of Staff Committee.<ref name="Horner">Horner, ''Making the Australian Defence Force'', pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref> According to historian [[Eric Andrews]], Wilton "chaffed over his lack of command over the services and the need for organisational reform".<ref>Andrews, ''The Department of Defence'', p. 226</ref> While CGS, he had joined Scherger in calling for a single Australian Defence Force organisation with one Minister of Defence, in contrast to the existing arrangement where each service operated with virtual autonomy, supported by its own minister and department.<ref name="Horner"/><ref>Andrews, ''The Department of Defence'', p. 183</ref>  In July 1967, he became a member of the Tertiary Education (Services' Cadet Colleges) Committee to plan a tri-service military academy, which was eventually opened as the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] in 1986.<ref>Moore, ''Duntroon'', pp. 307, 325</ref> He was also able to push through a plan to establish, in 1970, the [[Joint Intelligence Organisation]] to replace the former Joint Intelligence Bureau and three single-service intelligence groups.<ref name="Horner"/><ref>Dennis et al, ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 180</ref>

}}
In 1967, and again in 1970, Wilton recommended the creation of a single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of the Defence Minister, the Defence Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of this at the time,<ref name="Andrews 184"/> Wilton was consulted by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] in the December 1972 Federal election.<ref>Andrews, ''The Department of Defence'', pp. 196<U+2013>197</ref> The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.<ref>Horner, "The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements", pp. 24<U+2013>27</ref>

==Later life==
Wilton was succeeded as CCOSC by Admiral [[Victor Smith|Sir Victor Smith]] on 23&nbsp;November 1970, and retired from the military.<ref name=ADB/><ref name="CDF"/> He subsequently joined the [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Kerr Committee]] reviewing pay and conditions in the armed forces.<ref name=ADB/> Wilton finished his career as a diplomat, serving as Australia's [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]] in New York from September 1973 to November 1975.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Moore, ''Duntroon'', p. 433</ref> In 1979 he became one of the first sponsors of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which advocated for a treaty between the Federal government and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] representatives. He died of [[prostate cancer]] at his home in Canberra on 10&nbsp;May 1981, aged seventy.<ref name=ADB/><ref name="SMH">{{cite news|title=John Wilton: general and diplomat|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Mf5jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2eYDAAAAIBAJ&dq=john%20wilton%20army&pg=6770%2C4469853|page=8|date=11 May 1981|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> Survived by his wife and children, Wilton was accorded a military funeral at Duntroon and cremated at Norwood Park Crematorium.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=Funeral>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article125633859 |title=Funeral service of General Sir John Wilton |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=14 May 1981 |accessdate=28 April 2015 |page=12}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Reflecting on Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped prevent communism spreading to Laos and Cambodia, as well as delaying the takeover of [[South Vietnam]] by almost a decade. "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict "unless you are prepared to win", because it was "not something that you can just put one foot in and feel the temperature".<ref>Ekins; McNeill, ''Fighting to the Finish'', p. 705</ref>

Biographer David Horner described Wilton as "arguably the most important and influential Australian Army officer in the second half of the twentieth century".<ref name="Strategic Command XIV"/> Horner credited him with making significant contributions to the evolution of the Australian Defence Force through the pursuit of joint command and control.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 373<U+2013>375</ref> He further noted that whereas Wilton's predecessor as CCOSC, Fred Scherger, had been promoted to 4-star rank after four years in the role, and Wilton himself after two-and-a-half, Wilton's successors gained their 4-star rank upon taking up the position, indicating its growing importance.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 289, 357</ref>

From an early age Wilton was considered cerebral and introspective; his colleagues in adulthood found him to have an incisive mind, high standards, and little inclination or capacity for small talk.<ref name=ADB/><ref name="Commanders 332">McNeill, "General Sir John Wilton", p. 332</ref> His serious demeanour earned him the ironic nicknames "Happy Jack", "Smiling John" and "Sir Jovial", though he was capable of thoughtful gestures and flashes of humour.<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 173, 206, 350</ref> Major General [[Paul Cullen (general)|Paul Cullen]], the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizen Military Forces]] member of the Military Board from 1964 to 1966, described Wilton as "very stiff, very regular, very formal<U+2014>but a pleasant man".<ref>Baker, ''Paul Cullen'', p. 183</ref> Korean War historian [[Robert O'Neill]] contended that "One of the most remarkable aspects of his career was that he rose so far through a highly competitive profession without ever playing to the gallery."<ref name="Age"/>
