'''S<U+1EA7>m S<U+01A1>n''' is a resort town in Northern [[Vietnam]], situated 16&nbsp;km east of [[Thanh Hoa Province]]'s capital, [[Thanh Hoa]], on the shore of the [[South China Sea]]. 

The French colonial rulers began exploiting S<U+1EA7>m S<U+01A1>n in [[1906]], and it became a famous place in what was then [[French Indochina]]. At that time, many holiday [[villa]]s were constructed here.

The resort is considered to have one of the most beautiful beaches in the country. Every year it attracts about 500,000 tourists from Vietnam and abroad.

In April and May [[2007]], S<U+1EA7>m S<U+01A1>n celebrated the 100th anniversary of its establishment by organizing a S<U+1EA7>m S<U+01A1>n Festival.

The Thanh Hoa government invested US$375,000 to upgrade infrastructure along the sea, on water supply, lighting systems and an information network to prepare for the festival. About 22 training courses were organized for 3,000 cyclists, cameramen, vendors and tourist guides.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sam Son - an attractive tourism destination | work = Vietnam National Administration of tourism | date = [[2007-05-17]]| url = http://www.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/english/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=910&Itemid=1 | accessdate = 2007-05-17}}</ref>
 
Among the attractions of the resort are Truong Le Mount and Trong Mai Island, Quang Cu ecological [[fond]]s.

At present, S<U+1EA7>m S<U+01A1>n has a substantial level of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and has therefore been the focus of international organizations' efforts to prevent the infection spreading. There are a women's peer group and a Health Centre, which provide information about [[HIV]]'s dangers and healthy, moral behavior.<ref>{{cite web | title = Women join fight against HIV/AIDS with successful peer group | work = The UNDP HIV/AIDS Portal for Asia Pacific | date = [[2007-05-17]]| url = http://www.youandaids.org/Features/Vietnam15Aug.asp | accessdate = 2007-05-17}}</ref>
