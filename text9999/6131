'''Randall David Johnson''' (born [[September 10]], [[1963]]), nicknamed "'''the Big Unit'''", is a left-handed [[United States|American]] [[starting pitcher]] who currently plays for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. He is easily one of the most talented pitchers to ever play the game, as well as one of the three or four most dominant pitchers of his era (along with [[Pedro Martinez]], [[Greg Maddux]], and [[Roger Clemens]]).

The 6-foot-10 Johnson has been celebrated for having one of the most dominant [[fastball]]s in the game.  He regularly approached, and occasionally exceeded, 100 miles per hour during his prime.  However, his signature pitch is a hard, biting [[slider]].  Johnson has won the [[Cy Young Award]] five times, second only to [[Roger Clemens]]' seven.

For all active pitchers through the 2007 season, Johnson is first in strikeouts per nine innings pitched (10.78 -- which is also first for all pitchers in history) and hit batsmen (182 -- fourth all-time), second in strikeouts (4,619 -- third all-time) and hits allowed per nine innings pitched (7.14), second in shutouts (37), fourth in wins (284), sixth in ERA (3.22) and wild pitches (102), and seventh in won-lost percentage (.654).  His 4,616 strikeouts are also first all-time among left-handed pitchers.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]], [[California]], to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles (<U+201C>Bud<U+201D>) Johnson.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/rjohnson.htm</ref> By the time he entered [[Livermore High School]], he was a star in [[baseball]] and [[basketball]].  In 1982, as a senior, he fanned 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a [[perfect game]] in his last high school start.  He also played on a Burkovich team that assembled top players from throughout California.

He continued to star at the [[University of Southern California]] under legendary coach [[Rod Dedeaux]], but often exhibited control problems.

==Professional career==
===Seattle Mariners (1989-1998)===
Since entering the majors, Johnson has been among the most feared pitchers in the game because of his blazing fastball.  It was augmented by his intimidating appearance (height, wild [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] hairstyle and [[moustache]]), and his angry, energetic demeanor on the mound.  Part of his early intimidation factor came from his dramatic lack of control; after being traded away to the [[Seattle Mariners]] by the [[Montreal Expos]] for [[Mark Langston]], Johnson led the AL in walks for three consecutive seasons (1990-92), and in hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993.  In July 1991, facing the Brewers, the erratic Johnson allowed four runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings.  A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a no-hitter against Oakland.  Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.  

But his untapped talent was volcanic; in 1990, Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out [[Wade Boggs]] three times in one game, and a no-hitter against Detroit attested to his potential.  Johnson credits a session with [[Nolan Ryan]] late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that he appreciated Johnson's talent and did not want to see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken.  Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and as such, he usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the plate more consistently.<ref>http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/RJohnson/RJohnson_bio.html</ref> (In an odd circumstance, the meeting served as a metaphoric "passing of the torch," as it occurred in conjunction with the final game ever pitched by Ryan. In what would be Ryan's last start, he was glaringly ineffective against the Mariners, allowing five runs without recording an out.  It turned out that he was seriously injured, and Ryan announced his retirement after the season.)

Johnson broke out in [[1993]] with a 19-8 record, 3.24 ERA and his first of six 300-plus strikeout seasons (308).  In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was the Oakland A's.  He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against Minnesota's [[Chuck Knoblauch]], who is exactly one foot shorter than Johnson.

After pitching well in the strike-shortened [[1994]], Johnson won the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award]] in [[1995]] with an 18-2 record, 2.48 ERA and 294 strikeouts.  His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]], who had gone 15-1 for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1937.  Johnson, who also finished second in the 1993 and 1997 Cy Young voting, and third in 1994, remains the only Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the award.

Johnson capped the Mariners' late season comeback by pitching a 3-hitter in the AL West's one-game playoff, crushing the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]]' hopes with 12 strikeouts.  Thus unable to start in the 5-game ALDS series against the Yankees until the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2-0 series lead.  Johnson beat the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in 7 innings.  

When the series went the full five games,the Mariners having come back from an 0-2 deficit to win both games at the [[Kingdome]], Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance in the series final, Game 5, on only one day's rest.  Johnson's slow walk to the pitcher's mound from the left field bullpen electrified the sold-out home crowd. Entering a 4-4 game in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the 9th, 10th, and 11th innings.  He allowed 1 run, struck out 6, and held on for the series-ending win in Seattle's dramatic comeback.   

Johnson posted an 0-6 playoff record in his next four playoff series, each of which his teams lost. The six consecutive post-season losses tied a major league record, as Johnson developed a reputation as a poor "big game pitcher."

Johnson was sidelined throughout much of the [[1996]] season with a back injury, but he rebounded in [[1997]] with a 20-4 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best).  Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53-9, including a 16-0 streak that fell one short of the AL record.  Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts in 1997, on June 24 and August 8.

In June 1997, [[Oakland]] slugger [[Mark McGwire]]'s swing connected perfectly with a Randy Johnson fastball; the result was a rocketing home run into the upper deck of the Kingdome, later estimated at 538 feet.  The image of the home run bouncing off the left field wall of the Kingdome, above the seats, complete with Johnson swiveling and mouthing the word "Wow!," was replayed repeatedly on sports highlight shows.  Johnson had 19 strikeouts in the game but lost, 4-1. Despite the claim of 538 feet, independent research later concluded that the farthest the ball could have traveled was 474 feet[http://www.slate.com/id/2095/]- 64 feet shorter than the Mariners' estimate.

===National League bound===
[[1998]] was a tale of two seasons for Johnson. He was due to become a free agent at the end of the season but the Mariners' budget prevented them from making any serious offers for a contract extension during the season.  Johnson was traded on [[July 31]], [[1998]] when a deadline trade sent him to the [[Houston Astros]] for [[Freddy Garc<U+00ED>a]], [[Carlos Guill<U+00E9>n]], and a player to be named later (eventually [[John Halama]]). Houston was in the thick of a pennant race and Johnson's strong arm anchored their rotation. In 11 starts, he went 10-1 with a sparkling 1.28 ERA, leading the Astros to the playoffs. Despite only pitching for a third of a season in the National League, Johnson finished 7th in National League Cy Young Award voting.  Johnson's 1998 post-season was less positive.  Despite striking out 17 [[San Diego Padres]] and walking 2 in 14 innings, the Astros scored only one run while Johnson was on the mound.  Johnson finished the series 0-2 with a 1.93 ERA due to lack of run support.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (1999-2004)=== 
Johnson signed one of the largest contracts to that date in the off-season, inking a $53-million, four-year deal with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]; a second-year and relatively inexperienced franchise.  It turned out to be one of the best free agent signings in baseball history, as Johnson won the NL [[Cy Young Award]] in each of the four seasons covered by the contract.

The deal paid immediate dividends for Arizona, as Johnson led the team to the playoffs that year on the strength of a 17-9 record and 2.48 ERA, enough to earn him his second Cy Young Award.  Johnson's numbers could have been even more impressive; at one point in the season, Arizona failed to score a run in four consecutive Johnson starts, including a pair of 1-0 losses.  Johnson's pitching line in the four starts: 32 innings, 19 hits, 54 strikeouts, a 1.40 ERA and an 0-4 won-lost record.  Both Johnson and [[Pedro Martinez]] won 1999 Cy Young Awards, thus joining [[Gaylord Perry]] as the only pitchers to have won the award in both the American and National Leagues.  ([[Roger Clemens]] has since done the same.)

Johnson finished 2000 with 19 wins, 347 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA, and won his second NL Cy Young Award.  Just as importantly for the Diamondbacks' future, the team acquired [[Curt Schilling]] from the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in July 2000, giving Arizona the most feared power pitching duo in the sport of baseball at the time. 

Johnson and Schilling carried the Arizona Diamondbacks to their first franchise [[World Series]] appearance and victory in [[2001]] against the powerful [[New York Yankees]], in only their fourth year of existence. The two pitchers shared the [[World Series MVP Award]] and were named ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 2001 "[[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]]".  For the first of two consecutive seasons, Johnson and Schilling finished 1-2 in the Cy Young balloting.

Johnson's performance was particularly dominating, pitching seven innings for the victory in Game 6 and then coming on in relief-- on zero days' rest-- to pick up the win in Game 7.  Johnson had already pitched a shutout in Game 2, thus tying the record with three wins in one World Series, and erasing many of the doubts regarding his post-season ineffectiveness.  Of Arizona's 11 post-season wins in 2001, Johnson had five.

Johnson's Game 7 relief appearance was his second of the 2001 season; on July 19, a game against the Padres was delayed by two electrical explosions in [[Qualcomm Stadium]].  When the game resumed the following day, Johnson stepped in as the new pitcher and racked up 16 strikeouts in 7 innings, technically setting the record for the most strikeouts in a relief stint.

Johnson struck out [[List of pitchers who have struck out 18 or more batters in a nine-inning MLB game|20 batters in a game]] on May 8, 2001 against the [[Cincinnati Reds]].  Johnson recorded all 20 strikeouts in the first nine innings, but because the game went into extra innings, it was not categorized by MLB as an "official" 20-strikeout game (Tom Cheney's 16-inning, 21-strikeout game is also listed separately).  Baseball has since reversed itself on the game, and now lists Johnson with [[Roger Clemens]] (twice) and [[Kerry Wood]] as the only pitchers to strike out 20 batters in nine innings.

[[Image:Bird Beanball.png|200px|right|thumb|"Bird Beanball"]]
In a freak accident on [[March 24]], [[2001]], during the 7th inning of a [[spring training]] game against the [[San Francisco Giants]], Johnson threw a fastball that struck and killed a [[dove]].  The unlucky bird swooped across the infield just as Johnson was releasing the ball.  After being struck by the pitch, the bird landed amid a "sea of feathers."  The official call was "no pitch".<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=qa1</ref>

In 2002, Johnson won the pitching [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]], leading the NL in wins, ERA and strikeouts, and was voted his fourth consecutive [[Cy Young Award]].  It was Johnson's fifth consecutive 300-strikeout season, a record.  He also became the only pitcher in baseball history to post a 24-5 record.<ref>http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743261585/</ref>  On [[August 23]], [[2002]], Johnson struck out 3 batters on 9 pitches in the 6th inning of a 3-2 win over the Chicago Cubs, becoming the 30th pitcher in major league history to accomplish the [[Pitchers who struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning]].

Johnson spent the majority of the {{by|2003}} season on the disabled list and wasn't effective in the few injury-hampered starts he did make. One thing he did accomplish that year was hit his first career home run in a [[September 19]], [[2003]] game against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. It is the only home run to date for Johnson, a career .128 hitter. 

On [[May 18]], [[2004]], Johnson became only the 17th player to throw a [[perfect game]], and at 40 years of age, the oldest.  Johnson had 13 strikeouts on his way to a 2-0 defeat of the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The perfect game made him the fifth pitcher in Major League history (after [[Cy Young]], [[Jim Bunning]], [[Nolan Ryan]] and [[Hideo Nomo]]) to pitch a no-hitter in both leagues.

On [[June 29]], [[2004]], Johnson struck out [[Jeff Cirillo]] of the [[San Diego Padres]] to become only the fourth MLB player to reach 4,000 strikeouts in a career. 

He finished the 2004 season with a 16-14 record, but had a far better season than his won-lost total indicated; the D-Backs scored two or fewer runs in 17 of his 35 starts that season. Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290). In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13-2.  As his team only won 51 games that year, his ratio of winning 31.3% of his team's games was the highest for any starting pitcher since [[Steve Carlton]] in [[1972]] (who won 27 of the [[Phillies]] 59 wins for an all-time record ratio of 45.8%). He finished second to [[Roger Clemens]] in that year's Cy Young Award balloting.  Johnson was unhappy with the D-Backs offense, and demanded a trade.

===New York Yankees (2005-06)=== 
On [[January 6]], [[2005]], Johnson was traded to the [[New York Yankees]]. Johnson pitched Opening Day for the Yankees on [[April 3]], [[2005]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]].  Johnson was inconsistent through 2005, allowing 32 home runs; however, he regained his dominance in late 2005.  He was 5-0 against the Yankees' division rival Red Sox and finished the season 17-8 with a 3.79 ERA, and was second in the AL with 211 strikeouts.

In [[2005]], ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their [[1999]] book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''.  Johnson did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher and his 2001 World Championship season taken into account, he was ranked at Number 60.

Johnson was a disappointment in Game 3 of the 2005 [[Division Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], allowing 5 runs on 2 home runs in 3 innings.  In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance after [[Mike Mussina]] gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5-2 lead, but the Yankees were unable to come back in the series.  It was Johnson's first relief appearance since Game 7 of the [[2001 World Series]].  After an inconclusive year in pinstripes, New York fans hoped that Johnson would return to his dominant style in his second Yankee season.

Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season.  Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with a 17-11 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It had been revealed at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure had caused him to miss his last start of 2006. After being given [[epidural anesthesia]] and a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS, however he gave up 5 runs in 5 2/3 innings. 

===Back With The Diamondbacks (2007-present)===
On January 5, 2007, the Yankees traded Johnson back to the Diamondbacks, almost two years to the day that Arizona had traded him to New York, for a package of five young players and prospects. 

The Yankees decision to trade Johnson was primarily based on his pre-season request to be traded after the passing of his brother. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman was very sympathetic to Johnson's grief and agreed to trade him back to the Diamondbacks so that Johnson could be closer to his family. (Johnson's full time home is in a city adjacent to Phoenix) 

Johnson missed most of April rehabbing his injured back, before returning on April 24, 2007.  Johnson allowed six runs in 5 innings and took the loss, but struck out seven.  He returned to form, and by his tenth start of the season was among the NL's top ten strikeout pitchers.  But on July 3, his surgically repaired disc from the previous season was reinjured.  Johnson had season-ending surgery on the same disc, this time removing it completely.  Reporting that the procedure went "a little better than expected," Arizona hopes Johnson will be ready for the 2008 season.

==Pitching style==
In the prime of his career, Johnson's [[fastball]] had been consistently clocked over 100 mph, it was clocked as high as 102 mph. <ref>[http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/LoriGrabel.shtml Fastball clocked as high as 102 mph]</ref>.  His signature pitch is the [[slider]] that breaks down and away from left-handed hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low to mid 90s along with tight late break, hitters often believe they were thrown a fastball before the ball breaks just before it crosses home plate. One would see right-handed hitters swing through and miss his slider that would nearly hit their back foot, demonstrating the devastating effect of the pitch, <ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/tom_verducci/05/16/johnson/index.html Showing his age]</ref>.  Johnson dubbed his slider "Mr. Snappy".<ref>{{cite web
|url = http://www.sportingnews.com/exclusives/20050504/617694.html|title = El Meteoro? Not quite the same ring as Twinkletoes|accessdate = 2007-10-09|author = Josh Lewin|date = [[2005-05-04]]|publisher = Sporting News}}</ref>  In later years, his fastball declined to the 90-95 mph range. Johnson also throws a split-finger fastball that behaves like a change-up, as well as sinker to induce ground-ball outs. <ref>[http://feeds.foxsports.com/mlb/playerScouting?categoryId=85962 Randy Johnson Scouting Report]</ref>

Due to his height, long arms, and side-arm pitching, Johnson's pitches appear as if they are coming from the first base side of the mound, easily deceiving left-handed hitters. This deceives the hitter into thinking that Johnson is pitching from closer than he actually is. However, with the decline in his fast ball's velocity, right-handed batters have had greater success in noticing his release point and hitting his pitches.

Long time fans, who have viewed many of Johnson's pitching performances, know that Johnson's signature pointing to the sky at the completion of his tour on the mound is a tribute to his father who passed away on Christmas Day, 1992 before Johnson became the dominating pitcher he is now known as.

=="Big Unit" Nickname==
During batting practice in 1988, the 6'10" Johnson, then with the [[Montreal Expos]], collided head-first with outfielder [[Tim Raines]], prompting his teammate to exclaim, "You're a big unit!".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050527&content_id=1064763&vkey=news_nyy&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy|title=Big beginnings for the Big Unit|last=Santasiere|first=Alfred|coauthors=Haley Swindal, Quentin Washington|accessdate=2007-06-18|date=[[2005-05-27]]|publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB Advanced Media, L.P.]]}}</ref>  The nickname stuck.
===Accomplishments===
* 10-time All-Star (1990, 1993-95, 1997, 1999, 2000-02, 2004)
* Led the league in ERA four times (1995, 1999, 2001, 2002)
* Led the league in strikeouts nine times (1992-95, 1999, 2000-02, 2004)
* World Series co-MVP ([[Curt Schilling]], 2001)
* 5 time Cy Young Award winner (1995, 2000-03)

===Jersey Number===
For most of his career, Johnson has worn number 51, a number that in Seattle is now worn by All-Star outfielder [[Ichiro Suzuki]]. Ichiro, who unlike most star players didn't have a preference for a jersey number, actually wrote a letter to Johnson upon arriving with the Mariners saying that he would never bring shame to the number.

However, Johnson wore number 41 while with the New York Yankees, since 51 was being worn by longtime Yankee [[Bernie Williams]]. In such cases, players with an attachment to their uniform number sometimes reverse the digits (as [[Carlton Fisk]] did when he switched from 27 to 72 after joining the [[Chicago White Sox]].  But 15 was also unavailable to Johnson, because the Yankees have retired the number in honor of the late [[Thurman Munson]]).  Johnson opted for 41, since he was 41 years old at the time he signed with New York.

Since returning to Arizona, Johnson has reverted back to his more familiar 51.

==Off the field==
Johnson guest starred in an [[episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which aired on [[March 19]], [[2006]].  
In the episode, Johnson promotes left-handed teddy bears and is met by [[Ned Flanders]] at a left-handers convention.

Johnson appeared in the movie ''[[Little Big League]]'', playing himself.

Johnson appeared in a [[Right Guard]] commercial where he fired dodgeballs at people representing odor.

Johnson also appeared in several commercials for Nike in 1998 shortly after being traded from the AL's Seattle Mariners to the NL's Houston Astros. He was filmed taking batting practice.

===Personal life===
Johnson has four children with his wife Lisa: Sammay (born 28 December 1994), Tanner (born 5 April 1996), Willow (born 23 April 1998), and Alexandria (born 4 December 1999). He is a resident of Paradise Valley, Arizona.

On [[March 28]], [[2006]], the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' revealed that Johnson has a 16-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, Heather Roszell (born 4 September 1989), living in [[Langley, Washington]].

For years, Johnson sported a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]] hairstyle.  Prior to acquiring Johnson for the Diamondbacks in 1999, manager [[Buck Showalter]] had a rule banning long hair.  He said nothing to Johnson about cutting his hair, drawing criticism from other players.  When he agreed to be traded to the Yankees, Johnson trimmed his hair and shaved his goatee in compliance with the Yankee team rules; he continued to wear it short even after being traded back to the Arizona Diamondbacks.
