'''Todman''' (7 October 1954-1976) was one of the greatest [[Australian]] [[Thoroughbred]] racehorses and an important sire.  He was perhaps best known as the winner of the inaugural STC [[Golden Slipper]] in 1957, being the first of [[Star Kingdom]]<U+2019>s five successive winners of the race. He was inducted into the [[Australian Racing Hall of Fame]] in 2005.  

Todman was bred at Baramul Stud in the Widden Valley, [[New South Wales]] by Stanley Wootton who had imported his sire, Star Kingdom (IRE) and also Newtown Wonder (GB) to Australia. He was a striking chestnut stallion from Oceana (GB) by Colombo. He was a brother to [[Noholme]] II (winner of the AJC [[Epsom Handicap]] etc. and a successful sire in US) and the stakes producing sires Faringdon and Shifnal.<ref name="ASB">[http://www.studbook.org.au/horse.aspx?hid=306452&pagetype=OFFSPRINGWINS Todman] Retrieved on 2009-6-20</ref>  

Todman won from six furlongs to nine and a half furlongs and was successful five times in races that are now classed as [[Group One]] races. Todman was an impressive sprinter, winning his first race by 10 lengths. He then won the [[Golden Slipper Stakes]] by eight lengths and won the [[Champagne Stakes (Australia)|Champagne Stakes]] by six lengths when he defeated [[Tulloch (horse)|Tulloch]]. He also won the [[Canterbury Guineas]] by eight lengths and ran record times in seven of his 10 wins. Todman raced 12 times for 10 wins, one second and one unplaced run.<br>

Todman died on 13 June 1976 at the Widden Stud, where he had spent his last four years. He was buried and commemorated by a headstone placed beside Star Kingdom's headstone at the Baramul Stud.<ref name="Pring83">Pring, Peter; ''The Star Kingdom Story'', The Thoroughbred Press, Sydney, 1983, ISBN 0-908133-06-5</ref> In 1978 at least 51 sons of Todman were standing at stud in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name="de Bourg">de Bourg, Ross, <U+201C>The Australian and New Zealand Thoroughbred<U+201D>, Nelson, West Melbourne, 1980, ISBN 0 17 005860 3</ref>
