'''Solange Piaget Knowles''' (born June 24, 1986), who performs under the [[mononymous person|mononym]] '''Solange''', is an American [[singer-songwriter]], [[actress]], [[model (person)|model]], [[dancer]], and [[DJ]]. Knowles was born and raised in [[Houston, Texas]] along with her older sister singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Beyonc<U+00E9>]], a former member of R&B group [[Destiny's Child]]. Showing an interest in music recording at an early age, she eventually broke into the music scene at 16. She has released two studios albums: ''[[Solo Star]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams]]'' in 2008, which peaked at number nine in the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.

Aside from recording, Knowles has ventured into film, modeling, and entrepreneurship. She co-launched the junior apparel collection Der<U+00E9>on, a sister line to [[House of Der<U+00E9>on]] that was established by her mother and sister. Knowles has been compared to her sister by the media, but she dismisses the notion, saying they are artistically different.

==Early life==

In June 2003, Mathew Knowles excitedly announced that he was considering adding Solange to Destiny's Child when the group reunited in 2004, thus turning them into a quartet for the first time since short-lived member [[Farrah Franklin]] left in 2000.

==Personal life==
Knowles, at age 17, married Daniel Smith in February 2004. Knowles met Smith at a high school party through mutual friends. He was in high school at the time and Knowles was 13 and in middle school; they called themselves high school sweethearts.<ref name="EdwardsFlying"/> On October 18, 2004, Knowles gave birth to their son, Daniel Julez Smith, Jr.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Wendy|coauthors=Peterson, Todd|date=2004-10-26|title=Solange Knowles Gives Birth to a Boy|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]]|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,734570,00.html|accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref> Knowles has partly expressed regret that she bore a child at an early age, but calls her son the greatest unplanned blessing. A song she wrote for her baby, "6 O' Clock Blues", was included on ''Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams''.<ref name="S2SSolMMD">{{cite web|url=http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200805&listid=03|title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s little sister Solange manages motherhood, music and a divorce|month=May|year=2008|work=[[Sister 2 Sister]]|accessdate=2008-12-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080805015953/http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200805&listid=03 |archivedate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>

After Daniel Julez' birth, the family moved to [[Moscow, Idaho]], where Knowles' husband continued studying in college.<ref name="KennedyChannels"/> In October 2007, Solange confirmed in an interview with ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine that she and Smith had divorced. Both of them co-parent the child.<ref name="ThrillsBooty"/><ref name="EdwardsFlying"/> After the divorce, Knowles and her child moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]], where they established their new home.<ref name="BarkerDecided"/> They have since relocated to Brooklyn, New York.

==Artistry==
Knowles cites as her influences [[Motown Records|Motown]] [[girl group]]s such as [[The Supremes]] and [[The Marvelettes]], and [[Martha Reeves]], lead singer of [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name="ThrillsBooty"/> She also listened to the music of English [[pop music|pop]] singer [[Dusty Springfield]], and according to Knowles, her "greatest music influence" is her mother, Tina Knowles, who was a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones.<ref name="ThrillsBooty"/>

Knowles says her first passion is writing songs.  She has been doing this since she was nine years old, and has collaborated with a number of songwriters and producers.<ref name="CosmoQ&A"/> On her debut album, Knowles had no control over which kinds of music to produce, because "when you're 14, everyone else is older and more seasoned and you trust their decisions".<ref name="RamaswamySoul"/> Knowles was more concerned with pleasing her record label by submitting to their desires.<ref name="EdwardsFlying"/> Her musical influences were better expressed on ''Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams'', when she considered herself mature and was able to write and produce songs as she wished, without worrying about the expectations of others.<ref name="RamaswamySoul"/> Knowles' lyrics tackle relationships, world issues, and deceased friends,<ref name="EdwardsFlying"/><ref name="S2SSolMMD"/> with her second album focusing on events in her life, such as marriage, divorce, and parenthood.<ref name="EdwardsFlying"/>

Aside from recording, Knowles occasionally paints as her hobby: "I think that painting, for me, is such an affirmative expression in that sometimes you don't know what the outcome is gonna be and each stroke and each brush for me is an emotion and, in the end, it comes out as a piece which is the most amazing thing.&nbsp;... It definitely provides a different outlet."<ref name="BarkerDecided"/>

==Public image==
Knowles has always been compared by the media to her sister, [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]], whom she considers one of her role models. She has expressed her opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to "God Given Name": "I'm not her and never will be"<ref name="RamaswamySoul"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2008/10/solange_volume_now/|title=VOLUME NOW: Solange Knowles|last=Murphy|first=Keith|date=2008-10-29|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref> <U+2014> which was purposely set as the album's opening track to show their differences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003846663|title=Solange Steps Out On Sophomore Solo Disc|date=2008-09-05|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|language=Ni|accessdate=2009-01-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In her review for the album, Jody Rosen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine referred to the lyrics a declaration of independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/22684278/review/22712701/solangel__the_hadley_st_dreams|title=Solange Knowles: Sol-Angel & The Hadley St. Dreams |last=Rosen|first=Jody|date=2008-09-04|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Knowles commented: "People think there should be this great rivalry between us, but there's never been any competition. There's a big age gap and we are two very different characters."<ref name="ThrillsBooty"/> In another interview, Knowles said that she would not live by her sister's level of stardom, stressing that she and Beyonc<U+00E9> are artistically different, even stating that blogger Teddy Birmingham was "disrespectful" for saying she was living in her sister shadow on his website "Teddytalks" in June 2009.<ref name="EdwardsFlying"/> Beyonc<U+00E9> was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry, reasoning that it "involves a lot of pressure". Knowles countered by saying, "It's good to have her advice, but we really have different goals".<ref name="RamaswamySoul"/>
