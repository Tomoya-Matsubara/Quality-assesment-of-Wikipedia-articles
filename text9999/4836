== Plot ==
===Season 1===
{{Main|List of Lost Girl episodes#Season 1 (2010)|l1=List of Lost Girl episodes (Season 1)}}

[[Bo Jones (Lost Girl)|Bo]] is a succubus who grew up in an adoptive [[human]] family, unaware of her non-human nature and of the [[Fairy|Fae]] world. Her succubus powers only become apparent to her when she accidentally kills her first love by draining him of his life energy, an act which forces her to flee her home. Bo exchanges her previously normal life for one without family or friends, moving from place to place whenever she kills again. 

In the pilot episode, Bo saves a human girl named Kenzi; the two quickly become friends and Kenzi decides they should team up to create a Fae/Human detective agency. Confronted by the Fae elders with having to choose a side ("Light" or "Dark"), Bo declares herself neutral, deciding to side with humans after Kenzi risked her life to find what had happened to Bo for her own sake where most of the Fae simply saw her as another factor on the board. Throughout the season, Bo learns more about the Fae world and herself while she searches for information about her origins. Along the way, Bo also develops romantic relationships with both Dyson, a wolf shifter [[police detective]] and Lauren, a human [[Physician|doctor]].

===Season 2===
{{Main|List of Lost Girl episodes#Season 2 (2011-2012)|l1=List of Lost Girl episodes (Season 2)}}

With the world of Fae in chaos following Bo's explosive reunion with her mother, Bo must learn to "play the game" and navigate the inner workings of the Fae World in order to protect those who have helped to protect her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2011/08/lost-girl-season-2-new-press-release-on.html|title=Lost Girl Season 2 Press Release|work=Spoiler TV|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> Bo finds her resolve to stay free challenged, and is forced to question her own morals and beliefs. While Bo grows stronger and learns more about who she really is, relationships will be tested and passions will ignite, but answers will not come easily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2011/08/lost-girl-season-2-new-press-release-on.html|title=Lost Girl Season 2 Press Release|work=Spoiler TV|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref>

== Cast ==
[[File:Lost Girl cast at Fan Expo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The cast in August 2011 at [[Fan Expo Canada]]. From left: [[Rick Howland]], [[Ksenia Solo]], [[Anna Silk]], [[Zoie Palmer]], [[Kristen Holden-Ried]] and [[K.C. Collins]].]]
=== Main cast ===
{{unreferenced section}}
* [[Anna Silk]] as [[Bo Jones (Lost Girl)|Bo]] <U+2014> A succubus, she has the power to steal people's life force through their mouths with a kiss, to bewitch people with a touch, and to feed from sexual energy. Though at first she could not feed without killing, she has since learned to control her powers. She can only seem to go a few days without feeding before the drive overcomes her. Absorbing power from other Fae can increase her strength. She is best friends with Kenzi and is romantically involved with both Lauren and Dyson. <!--When Lauren's life was threatened and she was rendered near death, she displayed a strange, extremely powerful alternate persona, which drained the life from multiple individuals at a distance of several meters and declared that "there will be no more dark or light, only me". She has been given a vision of the future in which she kills Trick, who refers to her as "Ysabeau". -->

* [[Ksenia Solo]] as Kenzi <U+2014> Bo's best friend and sidekick- declared as Bo's 'property' to allow her to participate in Fae society-, despite being a normal human, who suggested Bo use her neutrality to her advantage to become a [[private investigator]]. A scam artist who displays [[kleptomania|kleptomanic]] tendencies, she can speak Russian fluently and possesses excellent street-smarts. <!--Despite their differences, she and Bo quickly became close, Bo choosing humanity rather than Fae because Kenzi risked her life to find out what had happened to Bo during her 'trial' where the Fae seemed to consider Bo just another factor in their game. She frequently acts as the [[comic relief]]. Her family is apparently highly connected. She frequently assists and/or vexes Hale. -->

* [[Kristen Holden-Ried]] as Dyson <U+2014> A "wolf-shifter" and a detective in the human world. He is quite strong and possesses an acute sense of smell. He is several hundred years old and very knowledgeable about Fae politics. A member of the Light Fae, his true allegiance is to Trick rather than the Ash. He is in love with Bo and is best friends with Hale, his Fae detective partner. <!-- In the season one finale, he sacrificed his love for Bo to give her the strength to defeat her insane mother as part of a deal with the Norn, leaving him with the memory of their relationship but unable to feel his old passion for her. He has since made efforts to remain friends with Bo, which was initially awkward as Bo tried to win him back. After being reunited with his old love Ciara, they began a relationship, which is hampered by Dyson's reluctance to reveal his encounter with the Norn and the price he paid, but eventually ended when he admitted that sacrificing his love for Bo cost him the ability to ever love again as wolves mate for life.-->

* [[Zoie Palmer]] as Lauren <U+2014> Owned by the Ash, she serves as a doctor and scientist for the Light Fae.  She was bewitched by Bo during their first meeting and has since fallen in love with her. She has extensive knowledge of the different types of Fae and their abilities. <!--In the first season, she taught Bo how to control her powers. It was later revealed that she has a human girlfriend named Nadia who is being kept in stasis because she contracted a disease that humans are normally immune to while on a humanitarian mission with Lauren. The Ash offered Lauren the help of the Fae curing Nadia, in exchange for her servitude, explaining why he "owns" her. With Bo's help, she discovers that she was tricked by the Ash: Nadia was cursed by a Fae to have the appearance of the disease in order to induce Lauren to accept servitude, so the Ash could use her medical expertise to help the Fae. When she discovers this, she goes to the new Ash and demands he release Nadia, discarding her allegiance when he refuses. After being imprisoned by the Ash, and with the progression of a string of Fae murders with which he requires her assistance, he arranges to free Nadia. Lauren renews her vow of servitude in payment, this time for life, not aware that it was Bo who actually removed the curse (Bo acting under the false impression that if she tells Lauren the curse will return, this time permanently).-->

* [[Rick Howland]] as Fitzpatrick "Trick" McCorrigan <U+2014> He is the owner and bartender of the only Fae pub in town, The [[Dal Riata]], which is neutral ground where Dark and Light Fae can go freely. Trick is very powerful; a Blood Seer, he has the ability to alter fate. Once known as the Blood King, he is on equal terms with the Fae elders, though few are aware of his true self. <!--Compared to other Fae (who have contempt for humans), he is very tolerant and even fond of humans, even trading away his most prized possession to help save Kenzi's life. He is extremely reluctant to use his blood powers, as they always carry a price; for example, his decision to write a future where Bo defeated Aoife resulted in Dyson sacrificing his love for Bo to give her the strength to win. -->

* [[K.C. Collins]] as Hale <U+2014> Dyson's colleague and another Fae undercover agent in the police force. He is a [[siren]], able to render humans and even other Fae unconscious or fascinate them with his whistle. Hale is good friends with Kenzi.  <!-- His family is relatively high-ranking in Fae society, but he disdains their social contacts in favour of making his own way, although Bo and Kenzi used his contacts when they needed to infiltrate a high-class Fae event.  -->

=== Recurring cast ===
* [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as Evony Florette Marquis, [[the Morr<U+00ED>gan]] <U+2014> The leader of the Dark Fae and possibly the only one of her kind. She runs a talent agency in the human world, where she represents young musicians and artists.

* [[Cl<U+00E9> Bennett]] as the Ash <U+2014> The leader of the Light Fae prior to and during the first season.  He hoped to bring Bo into the Light Fae, and uses Lauren to try to manipulate her. He is badly injured by an assassin sent by Bo's mother, and is in a coma at the end of the first season. 

* [[Vincent Walsh]] as the Ash <U+2014> A Fae named Lachlan who wins the now-vacant position of the Ash; smug, sexy, dangerous, charismatic and a formidable force in his own right. Power-hungry, he is a stickler for rules.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Girl - Season 2 Character Bios|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2011/08/lost-girl-season-2-character-bios.html|publisher=Spoiler TV|accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref> 

* [[Lina Roessler]] as Ciara <U+2014> An old love of Dyson's.  While she is initially treated frostily by Bo and Kenzi, Bo eventually comes to consider her a friend.

* [[Athena Karkanis]] as Nadia <U+2014> Lauren's human girlfriend.  Bo is later forced to kill her when the Garuda takes over her body.

* [[Aaron Ashmore]] as Nate - Kenzi's boyfriend. Kenzi and Nate used to be neighbors when they were children.

* [[Courtney-Jane White]] as Tori, the rebellious daughter of the Glaive, and a telepath with two hearts.

== Reception ==
Viewership of the [[television pilot|pilot]] was over 400,000 for the first airing, and "another 184,000" for the second airing, making it the "highest-rated Canadian scripted series premiere of all time on Showcase."<ref>{{cite press release| title=Lost Girl premiere achieves supernatural ratings |location= Toronto |date= September 14, 2010 | url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2010/14/c9654.html |publisher=Canwest Broadcasting |work= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |quote=Source: Canada: BBM-PPM Data - as of Sept 13, 2010.}}</ref>

In Canada, Rob Salem of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' described the show as one that "definitely bears watching."<ref>{{cite web |last=Salem |first=Rob |date=August 29, 2010 |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/article/853526--fall-tv-preview-sunday-bloody-sunday |title=Fall TV Preview: Sunday, bloody Sunday |publisher=Toronto Star}}</ref>
Vladislav Tinchev, writer for the German site ''Serienjunkies'' wrote that the series would benefit from "revealing more background information about the represented world," rather than spend time on "clumsy action scenes."  But Tinchev pointed out that "''Lost Girl'' is not lost at all, and has immediately won the audience and entertains them well. And there is nothing wrong with that, because TV series need not be world-shaking events."<ref>{{cite web |first=Vladislav |last=Tinchev |title=''Lost Girl'': Review of the pilot |work=Series Junkies |date=19 September 2010 |language=German |url=http://www.serienjunkies.de/news/lost-girl-28494.html}} ([http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&langpair=auto|en&u=http://www.serienjunkies.de/news/lost-girl-28494.html&tbb=1&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&usg=ALkJrhgTDU_BnjfWaw4pfnl7_bAZ4jpaOg English tr.])</ref>

Upon its U.S. premiere, ''The New York Times'' said "Like other fantasy-tinged shows on Syfy and USA, it offers the minor pleasures of formulaic fantasy and weekly puzzle solving, though in a cheaper-looking and less original package than usual"; "''Lost Girl'' could be more than routine if we felt Bo<U+2019>s magnetism the way her hapless victims do, but through the first few episodes Ms. Silk is more stolid than steamy."<ref name="nyt2012"/> In his review for ''Variety'', Brian Lowry wrote: "At first glance, ''Lost Girl'' looks like another one of those Canadian imports picked up mostly for financial reasons. The pilot, however, proves unexpectedly fun&mdash;a sort of diluted version of ''[[True Blood]]''... but the show has wit, style and an enticing lead in the leather-clad Anna Silk."<ref name="var2012"/>
