'''Chess''' is a [[board game]] played between two [[Player (game)|players]]. It is played on a [[chessboard]], which is a square-checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen [[Chess piece|pieces]]: one [[king (chess)|king]], one [[queen (chess)|queen]], two [[rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[knight (chess)|knights]], two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]], and eight [[pawn (chess)|pawns]]. The object of the game is to [[checkmate]] the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "[[Check (chess)|check]]") and there is no way to remove or defend it from attack on the next move.

The current form of the game emerged in [[Europe]] during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a much older game ([[Shatranj]]) of [[India]]n origin. Aspects of [[art]] are found in [[Chess problem|chess composition]]. Theoreticians have developed extensive [[chess strategy|chess strategies]] and [[chess tactics|tactics]] since the game's inception. One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a [[Computer chess|chess-playing machine]]. Chess is now deeply influenced by the abilities of chess programs and the opportunity for online play. In 1997 [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] became the first computer to beat a reigning World Champion in a [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|match]] when it defeated [[Garry Kasparov]].

The tradition of organized competitive chess started in the 16th century. The first official [[World Chess Champion]], [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], claimed his title in 1886; the current World Champion is [[Viswanathan Anand]]. Chess is a [[Olympic_sports#Recognized_sports|recognized sport]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]], and is led by the [[FIDE]]. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in [[Chess club|clubs]], online, by [[correspondence chess|correspondence]], and in [[List of chess terms#Tournament|tournaments]].

==Rules==
{{Main|Rules of chess}} 
The official rules of chess are maintained by the [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]]. Along with information on official [[chess tournament]]s, the rules are described in the ''FIDE Handbook'', section Laws of Chess.<ref>{{cite web

Chess is played on a square [[Chessboard|board]] of eight rows (called [[rank (chess)|''ranks'']] and denoted with numbers ''1'' to ''8'') and eight columns (called [[file (chess)|''files'']] and denoted with letters ''a'' to ''h'') of squares. The colors of the sixty-four squares alternate and are referred to as "light squares" and "dark squares". The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right hand end of the rank nearest to each player, and the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram, with each [[Queen (chess)|queen]] on its own color.

The pieces are divided, by convention, into white and black sets. The players are referred to as "[[White and Black in chess|White]]" and "[[White and Black in chess|Black]]", and each begins the game with sixteen [[Chess piece|pieces]] of the specified color. These consist of one [[king (chess)|king]], one [[queen (chess)|queen]], two [[rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]], two [[knight (chess)|knights]] and eight [[pawn (chess)|pawns]].

===Movement===
The players alternately move one piece at a time (with the exception of ''[[castling]]'', when two pieces are moved simultaneously). Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square, or one occupied by an opponent's piece, capturing it and removing it from play. With the sole exception of ''[[en passant]]'', all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.

White always moves first. Each [[chess piece]] has its own style of moving. The Xs mark the squares where the piece can move if no other pieces (including one's own piece) are on the Xs between the piece's initial position and its destination. If there is an opponent's piece at the destination square, then the moving piece can capture the opponent's piece. The only exception is the pawn which can only capture pieces ''diagonally forward''.

[[File:ChessCastlingMovie.gif|thumb|250px|right|Examples of castling]]

===Castling===
{{Main|Castling}}

Once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as ''[[castling]]''. Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook, then placing the rook immediately on the far side of the king. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:<ref>{{cite web
 | title=The rules of chess
 | url=http://www.chessvariants.org/d.chess/chess.html
 | author=Bodlaender, Hans
 | publisher=Chess Variants
 | accessdate=2008-01-07
}}</ref>
*Neither of the pieces involved in the castling may have been previously moved during the game;
*There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
*The king and the rook must be on the same rank;<ref>Without this additional restriction, which was added to the FIDE rules in 1972, it would be possible to promote a pawn on the ''e'' [[Chess terminology#Files|file]] to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was "discovered" by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabb<U+00E9>]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the rules were amended to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabb<U+00E9>, see also [[:de:Pam-Krabb<U+00E9>-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.</ref>
*The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces. As with any move, castling is illegal if it would place the king in check.

===''En passant''===
[[File:ChessPawnSpecialMoves.gif|thumb|250px|right|Examples of pawn moves: promotion (left) and ''en passant'' (right)]]
{{Main|En passant}}
When a pawn advances two squares and there is an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it in passing, and move to the square the pawn passed over. However, this can only be done on the next move. For example, if the black pawn has just advanced two squares from g7 to g5, then the white pawn on f5 can take it via ''en passant'' on g6 (but only on white's next move).

===Promotion===
{{Main|Promotion (chess)}}

When a pawn advances to its eighth rank, it is exchanged at the player's choice for a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen, called [[underpromotion]]. In the diagram on the right, the pawn on c7 can choose to advance to the eighth rank to promote to a better piece.

===Check===
{{Main|Check (chess)}}

When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in [[Check (chess)|''check'']]. The only permissible responses to a check are to capture the checking piece, interpose a piece between the checking piece and the king (unless the attacking piece is a knight), or move the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check, nor is it permissible during the castle move for the king to travel over a space that is considered to be in check. A move that would place the moving player's king in check is illegal. The object of the game is to [[checkmate]] the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no way to remove it from attack.

===End of the game=== 
The objective of the game is to ''[[checkmate]]'' the opponent. This occurs when a move places the opponent's king in check, and there is no legal response for the opponent that removes it from attack.

Chess games do not have to end in checkmate <U+2014> either player may [[List of chess terms#Resign|resign]] if the situation looks hopeless. If it is a [[time control|timed]] game a player may run out of time and lose, even with a much superior position. Games also may end in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]] (tie). A draw can occur in several situations, including [[draw by agreement]], [[stalemate]], [[threefold repetition]] of a position, the [[fifty-move rule]], or a draw by impossibility of checkmate (usually because of [[list of chess terms#Insufficient material|insufficient material]] to checkmate). As some forced checkmates cannot be done in less than 50 moves (see e.g. [[pawnless chess endgame]] and [[two knights endgame]]), the fifty-move rule is not applied everywhere,<ref>50 moves rule is not applied at FICGS {{ cite web | url=http://www.ficgs.com/membership.html#chess
 | title=50 moves rules
 | accessdate=2009-12-01
 | publisher=FICGS
}}</ref> particularly in correspondence chess.

===Time control===
Besides casual games without exact timing, chess is also played with a [[time control]], mostly by club and professional players. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost (provided his opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate). The timing ranges from long games played up to seven hours to shorter [[rapid chess]] games lasting usually 30 minutes or one hour per game. Even shorter is [[blitz chess]] with a time control of three to fifteen minutes for each player, or [[bullet chess]] (under three minutes). Timing is most often controlled using a [[game clock]].

==Notation for recording moves==
[[File:SCD algebraic notation.png|frame|left|Algebraic chess notation]]
{{Main|Chess notation}}

Chess games and positions are recorded using a special notation, most often [[algebraic chess notation]].<ref>See paragraph "E. Algebraic notation" in:<br>{{cite web
 | url=http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=125&view=article
 | title=E.I.01B. Appendices
 | accessdate=2008-11-26
 | publisher=FIDE
}}</ref> ''Abbreviated (or short) algebraic notation'' generally records moves in the format ''abbreviation of the piece moved - file where it moved - rank where it moved'', e.g. ''Qg5'' means "queen moves to the ''g''-file and ''5th'' rank (that is, to the square ''g5''). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. ''Ngf3'' means "knight from the g-file moves to the square f3". The letter ''P'' indicating a pawn is not used, so that ''e4'' means "pawn moves to the square ''e4''".

If the piece makes a capture, "x" is inserted before the destination square, e.g. ''Bxf3'' means "bishop captures on f3". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial, and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous. For example, ''exd5'' (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on ''d5'') or ''exd'' (pawn on e-file captures something on the d-file).

[[File:Scholars mate animation.gif|frame|The "[[Scholar's mate]]"]]

If a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is indicated after the move,<ref>{{cite web
 | title=Learn Chess Notation
 | url=http://www.chesshouse.com/howto/How-to-Read-and-Write-Chess-Notation.asp
 | accessdate=2008-11-26
 | publisher=Chess House
}}</ref> for example ''e1Q'' or ''e1=Q''. Castling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 for kingside castling and 0-0-0 for queenside. A move which places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation "+" added. Checkmate can be indicated by "#" (occasionally "++", although this is sometimes used for a [[double check]] instead). At the end of the game, "1-0" means "White won", "0-1" means "Black won" and "<U+00BD>-<U+00BD>" indicates a draw.

Chess moves can be annotated with [[punctuation (chess)|punctuation marks and other symbols]]. For example ''!'' indicates a good move, ''!!'' an excellent move,
''?'' a mistake, ''??'' a blunder, ''!?'' an interesting move that may not be best or ''?!'' a dubious move, but not easily refuted.

For example, one variant of a simple trap known as the [[Scholar's mate]], animated in the picture to the right, can be recorded:
# e4 e5
# Qh5?! Nc6
# Bc4 Nf6??
# Qxf7# 1-0

==Strategy and tactics==
Chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term goals during the game <U+2013> for example, where to place different pieces <U+2013> while tactics concentrate on immediate manoeuvre. These two parts of chess thinking cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved by the means of tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play.

A game of chess is usually divided into three phases: [[Chess opening|opening]], usually the first 10 to 25 moves, when players move their pieces into useful positions for the coming battle; [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]], usually the fiercest part of the game; and [[Chess endgame|endgame]], when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and [[pawn promotion]] is often decisive.

===Fundamentals of strategy===
{{Main|Chess strategy}}

Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of pieces on board, control of the center and centralization, the [[pawn structure]], the king safety, the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open-files, and dark or light squares), etc.

|}
The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the [[Chess piece relative value|total value of pieces]] of both sides.<ref>Harding 2003, p. 1<U+2013>7</ref> The point values used for this purpose are based on experience; usually pawns are considered worth one point, knights and bishops about three points each, rooks about five points (the value difference between a rook and a bishop being known as [[The exchange (chess)|the exchange]]), and queens about nine points. In the endgame, the king is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook, thus it is sometimes assigned a fighting value of four points. These basic values are then modified by other factors like ''position of the piece'' (for example, advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares), ''coordination between pieces'' (for example, a pair of bishops usually coordinates better than the pair of a bishop and knight), or ''type of position'' (knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions).

Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard.<ref>Harding 2003, p. 138ff</ref> Pawns being the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as [[Isolated pawn|isolated]], [[Doubled pawns|doubled]] or [[backward pawn]]s and [[chess terminology#Hole|holes]], once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid them unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility to develop an attack).

}}

In chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions <U+2013> so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability or the strength of the [[chess engine]] and the performance of the computer it is run on{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep calculation is more difficult or may not be possible{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, while in "tactical" positions with a limited number of forced variations where much less than the best move would lose quickly, strong players can calculate very long sequences of moves.

Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions <U+2013> threats, exchanges of material, double attacks etc. <U+2013> can be combined into more complicated [[Combination (chess)|combinations]], sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players.<ref name="Harding 2003, p. 70ff">Harding 2003, p. 70ff</ref> Theoreticians described many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers, for example [[Pin (chess)|pins]], [[Fork (chess)|forks]], [[Skewer (chess)|skewers]], [[battery (chess)|batteries]], [[discovered attack]]s (especially discovered checks), [[zwischenzug]]s, [[deflection (chess)|deflections]], [[decoy (chess)|decoys]], [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]], [[undermining (chess)|underminings]], [[Overloading (chess)|overloadings]], and [[Interference (chess)|interferences]].<ref>Harding 2003, p. 8ff</ref>

A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a [[combination (chess)|combination]].<ref name="Harding 2003, p. 70ff"/> Brilliant combinations <U+2013> such as those in the [[Immortal Game]] <U+2013> are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.

===Opening===
{{Main|Chess opening}}

A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the "opening moves"). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as ''openings'' and have been given names such as the [[Ruy Lopez]] or [[Sicilian Defence]]. They are catalogued in reference works such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]''.

There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet positional play (e.g. the [[R<U+00E9>ti Opening]]) to very aggressive (e.g. the [[Latvian Gambit]]). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to 30<U+2013>35 moves or more.<ref>{{cite book

*''Development'': To place (develop) the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.
*''Control of the center'': Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.
*''King safety'': Keeping the King safe from dangerous possibilities. A correct timing for castling can often enhance this.
*''[[Pawn structure]]'': Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled or backward pawns, and pawn islands <U+2013> and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.

Most players and [[Chess theory|theoreticians]] consider that White, by virtue of the first move, [[First-move advantage in chess|begins the game with a small advantage]]. Black usually strives to neutralize White's advantage and achieve [[Glossary of chess#Equalise/Equalize|equality]], or to develop [[List of chess terms#Dynamism|dynamic]] [[List of chess terms#Counterplay|counterplay]] in an unbalanced position.

===Middlegame===
{{Main|Chess middlegame}}

The middlegame is the part of the game when most pieces have been developed. Because the opening theory has ended, players have to assess the position, to form plans based on the features of the positions, and at the same time to take into account the tactical possibilities in the position.<ref>Harding 2003, p. 32<U+2013>151</ref>

Typical plans or strategic themes <U+2013> for example the minority attack, that is the attack of [[Chess terminology#Queenside|queenside]] pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside <U+2013> are often appropriate just for some [[pawn structure]]s, resulting from a specific group of openings. The study of openings should therefore be connected with the preparation of plans typical for resulting middlegames.

Middlegame is also the phase in which most [[Combination (chess)|combinations]] occur. Middlegame combinations are often connected with the attack against the opponent's king; some typical patterns have their own names, for example the [[Boden's Mate]] or the [[Lasker - Bauer, Amsterdam, 1889|Lasker<U+2014>Bauer]] combination.

Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transform into an endgame (i.e. [[Chess terms#Simplification|simplify]]). For example, minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a [[Chess endgame#Bishop and pawn endings|''bishops and pawns'']] ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with [[opposite-colored bishops endgame|bishops on opposite colors]] is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of one or two pawns.

| An example of [[zugzwang]]: The side which is to make a move is in a disadvantage.}}

The endgame (or ''end game'' or ''ending'') is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and endgame:<ref>Harding 2003, p. 187ff</ref>
*During the endgame, pawns become more important; endgames often revolve around attempting to [[promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank.
*The king, which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack the pawns of opposite color, and hinder movement of the opponent's king.
*[[Zugzwang]], a disadvantage because the player has to make a move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. For example, the diagram on the right is zugzwang for both sides, as with Black to move he must play 1...Kb7 and let White queen a pawn after 2.Kd7; and with White to move he must allow a draw by 1.Kc6 stalemate or lose his last pawn by any other legal move.
Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces that remain on board. [[Checkmate#Basic checkmates|Basic checkmates]] are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, [[Chess endgame#King and pawn endings|king and pawn endgames]] involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to the pieces on board other than kings, e.g. "[[rook and pawn versus rook endgame]]".

The earliest evidence of Chess is found in the neighboring [[Sassanid Persia]] around 600 where the game is known under the name became ''[[chatrang]]''. Chatrang is evoked inside three epic romances written in Pahlavi (Medium Persian). Chatrang was taken up by the [[Muslim world]] after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633<U+2013>644) where it was then named ''[[shatranj]]'', with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "shatranj" was rendered as ''ajedrez'', in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as ''xadrez'', and in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''zatrikion'' (which directly comes from Persian ''chatrang''), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian ''sh<U+0101>h'' ("king"), which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words "[[Check (chess)|check]]" and "chess".<ref>At that time Spanish 'j' and 'x' were pronounced as English "sh", as is Portuguese 'x' still today.</ref> Murray theorized that this change happened from Muslim traders coming to European seaports with ornamental chess kings as curios before they brought the game of chess.<ref name="Murray"/>

Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with two younger players. [[United States|American]] [[Paul Morphy]], an extraordinary [[chess prodigy]], won against all important competitors (except [[Howard Staunton]], who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master [[Johannes Zukertort]] in 1886 is regarded as the first official [[World Chess Championship]]. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger German mathematician [[Emanuel Lasker]], who maintained this title for 27 years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.<ref>Kasparov 1983a</ref>
[[File:Wilhelm Steinitz2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm Steinitz]], the first World Chess Champion]]

It took a prodigy from [[Cuba]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Ra<U+00FA>l Capablanca]] (World champion 1921<U+2013>27), who loved simple positions and endgames, to end the German-speaking dominance in chess; he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years until 1924. His successor was Russian-French [[Alexander Alekhine]], a strong attacking player, who died as the World champion in 1946, having briefly lost the title to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] player [[Max Euwe]] in 1935 and regaining it two years later.<ref>Kasparov 1983b</ref>

Between the world wars, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernists]] like [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] and [[Richard R<U+00E9>ti]]. They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns, inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack.<ref>Fine 1952</ref>

After the end of the 19th century, the number of annually held master tournaments and matches quickly grew. Some sources state that in 1914 the title of [[International Grandmaster|chess grandmaster]] was first formally conferred by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] to Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, [[Siegbert Tarrasch|Tarrasch]] and [[Frank Marshall|Marshall]], but this is a disputed claim.<ref>This is stated for example in ''The Encyclopaedia of Chess'' (1970, p.223) by [[Anne Sunnucks]], but this is also disputed by [[Edward Winter (chess historian)]] in his [http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:Uv0K9qUrveUJ:www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter38.html+site:chesshistory.com/winter+Grandmaster+Tsar&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us Chess Notes 5144 and 5152].</ref> The tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]), founded in 1924 in [[Paris]]. In 1927, [[Women's World Chess Championship]] was established; the first to hold it was [[Czech people|Czech]]-[[English people|English]] master [[Vera Menchik]].<ref>{{cite web

===Post-war era (1945 and later)===
[[File:Capablanca-Lasker 1925.jpg|thumb|left|World Champions [[Jos<U+00E9> Ra<U+00FA>l Capablanca]] (left) and [[Emanuel Lasker]] in 1925]]
After the death of Alekhine, a new World Champion was sought in a tournament of elite players ruled by FIDE, who have controlled the title since then, with one interruption. The winner of the 1948 tournament, Russian [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], started an era of [[Soviet]] dominance in the chess world. Until the end of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American [[Bobby Fischer]] (champion 1972<U+2013>1975).<ref>Kasparov 2003b, 2004a, 2004b, 2006</ref>

In the previous informal system, the World Champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into "[[Interzonal]] tournaments", where they were joined by players who had qualified from "Zonal tournaments". The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the "Candidates" stage, which was initially a tournament, later a series of knock-out matches. The winner of the [[Candidates]] would then play the reigning champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system worked on a three-year cycle.

Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to [[Vasily Smyslov]], but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the [[Latvia]]n prodigy [[Mikhail Tal]], an accomplished tactician and attacking player. Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.

Following the 1961 event, FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, [[Armenia]]n [[Tigran Petrosian]], a genius of defense and strong positional player, was able to hold the title for two cycles, 1963<U+2013>1969. His successor, [[Boris Spassky]] from Russia (1969<U+2013>1972), was a player able to win in both positional and sharp tactical style.<ref>Kasparov 2003b, 2004a</ref>

[[File:Viswanathan Anand 08 14 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Current World Champion [[Viswanathan Anand]] ]]
The next championship, the so-called [[World Chess Championship 1972|Match of the Century]], saw the first non-Soviet challenger since [[World War II]], American [[Bobby Fischer]], who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and clearly won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet [[Anatoly Karpov]] when FIDE refused to meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default. Karpov defended his title twice against [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes.<ref>Kasparov 2003a, 2006</ref>

Karpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of another Russian player, [[Garry Kasparov]]. Kasparov and Karpov contested five world title matches between 1984 and 1990; Karpov never won his title back.<ref>{{cite book | author=Keene, Raymond | title=Gary Kasparov's Best Games |publisher=B. T. Batsford Ltd. | year=1993 | isbn=0-7134-7296-0 | oclc=29386838}}, p. 16.</ref>

In 1993, Garry Kasparov and [[Nigel Short]] broke with FIDE to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing [[Professional Chess Association]] (PCA). From then until 2006, there were two simultaneous World Champions and World Championships: the PCA or Classical champion extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games; the other following FIDE's new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his Classical title in 2000 to [[Vladimir Kramnik]] of Russia.

The [[World Chess Championship 2006]] reunified the titles, when Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion [[Veselin Topalov]] and became the undisputed World Chess Champion.<ref>{{cite web

Known in the circles of clerics, students and merchants, chess entered into the popular culture of Middle Ages. An example is the 209th song of [[Carmina Burana]] from the 13th century, which starts with the names of chess pieces, ''Roch, pedites, regina<U+2026>''<ref>{{cite web

===Modern===

To the [[Age of Enlightenment]], chess appeared mainly for self-improvement. [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his article "The Morals of Chess" (1750), wrote:

<blockquote>
"The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn:

'''I. Foresight''', which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action [...]

'''II. Circumspection''', which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: - the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations [...]

'''III. Caution''', not to make our moves too hastily [...]"<ref>{{cite web

With these or similar hopes, chess is taught to children in schools around the world today and used in armies to train minds of cadets and officers. Many schools hold chess clubs and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. In addition, many countries have chess organizations that hold tournaments regularly, such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.<ref>{{cite web

Moreover, chess is often depicted in the [[arts]]; significant works, where chess plays a key role, range from Thomas Middleton's ''[[A Game at Chess]]'' over ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' by Lewis Carroll to ''[[The Royal Game]]'' by Stefan Zweig or Vladimir Nabokov's ''[[The Defense]]''. Chess is also important in films like Ingmar Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' or Satyajit Ray's ''[[The Chess Players]]''.

Chess is also present in the contemporary popular culture. For example, J. K. Rowling's [[Harry Potter]] plays "[[Magical objects in Harry Potter|Wizard's Chess]]" while the characters of ''[[Star Trek]]'' prefer "[[Three-dimensional chess#Tri-Dimensional Chess|Tri-Dimensional Chess]]" and the hero of ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]'' struggles against adopting the aggressive and misanthropic views of a real chess grandmaster.{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}<ref>{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}{{cite web

One of the most famous chess studies ever. It seems impossible to catch the advanced black pawn, while the black king can easily stop the white pawn. The solution is [[diagonal]] advance, bringing the king to ''both'' pawns at the same time: 1.Kg7! h4 2.Kf6! Kb6 (or 2...h3 3.Ke7 and the white king can support its pawn) 3. Ke5!! (now the white king comes just in time to his pawn, or catches the black one) 3...h3 4. Kd6 draw.

{{Main|Chess problem}}

Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems (these problems themselves are sometimes also called chess compositions). A person who creates such problems is known as a [[chess composer]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Howard, Kenneth S | title=How to Solve Chess Problems |publisher=Courier Dover Publications| year=1961 | isbn=0-486-20748-X}}</ref>

Most chess problems exhibit the following features:
*The position is ''composed'', that is, it has not been taken from an actual game, but has been invented for the specific purpose of providing a problem.
* There is a specific ''stipulation'', that is, a goal to be achieved; for example, to checkmate black within a specified number of moves.
* There is a ''theme'' (or combination of themes) that the problem has been composed to illustrate: chess problems typically instantiate particular ideas. Many of these themes have their own names, often by persons who used them first, for example [[Novotny (chess)|Novotny]] or [[Lacny]] theme.
* The problem exhibits ''economy'' in its construction: no greater force is employed than that required to guarantee that the problem's intended solution is indeed a solution and that it is the problem's only solution.
* The problem has ''aesthetic value''. Problems are experienced not only as puzzles but as objects of beauty. This is closely related to the fact that problems are organized to exhibit clear ideas in as economical a manner as possible.

There are many types of chess problems. The two most important are:
* '''Directmates''': white to move first and checkmate black within a specified number of moves against any defense. These are often referred to as "mate in ''n''" - for example "mate in three" (a ''three-mover'').
* '''[[Endgame study|Studies]]''': orthodox problems in which the stipulation is that white to play must win or draw. Almost all studies are [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions.

Chess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport, and tournaments (or ''tourneys'') exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems.<ref name="WeeninkChessProblem">{{ cite book | author=Weenink, H.G.M. | editor=Hume, G., and White, A.C. | title=The Chess Problem | year=1926 }}</ref>

==Competitive play==
===Organization of competitions===
Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues, tournaments and [[congress]]es. Chess's international governing body is [[FIDE]] (F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale des <U+00C9>checs). Most countries have a national chess organization as well (such as the [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] and [[English Chess Federation]]), which in turn is a member of FIDE. FIDE is a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]],<ref>{{cite web

 | title=World Chess Federation
 | publisher=International Olympic Committee
 | accessdate=2008-11-26
}}</ref> but the game of chess has never been part of the [[Olympic Games]]; chess does have its own [[Chess Olympiad|Olympiad]], held every two years as a team event.

The current World Chess Champion is [[Viswanathan Anand]] of [[India]].<ref>{{cite web
 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/2007-09-30-anand_N.htm
 | title=India's Anand seizes chess title

}}</ref> The reigning Women's World Champion is [[Alexandra Kosteniuk]] from [[Russia]] but the world's highest rated female player, [[Judit Polgar]], has never participated in the [[Women's World Chess Championship]], instead preferring to compete with the leading men and maintaining a ranking among the top twenty male players.

Other competitions for individuals include the [[World Junior Chess Championship]], the [[European Individual Chess Championship]] and the [[List of national chess championships|National Chess Championships]]. Invitation-only tournaments regularly attract the world's strongest players and these include Spain's [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] event, Monte Carlo's [[Melody Amber]] tournament, the [[Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting|Dortmund Sparkassen]] meeting, Sofia's [[M-tel Masters]] and Wijk aan Zee's [[Corus chess tournament|Corus]] tournament.

Regular team chess events include the aforementioned [[Chess Olympiad]] and the [[European Team Championship]]. The [[38th Chess Olympiad]] was held 2008 in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]]; [[Armenia]] won the gold in the unrestricted event second time in a row after [[37th Chess Olympiad|Turin 2006]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] took the top medal for the women. The [[World Chess Solving Championship]] and World [[Correspondence Chess]] Championships are both team and individual events.

Besides these prestigious competitions, there are thousands of other chess tournaments, matches and festivals held around the world every year, which cater to players of all levels, from beginners to experts. Chess is also promoted as a "mind sport" by the [[Mind Sports Organisation]] alongside other [[mental-skill game]]s, such as [[Contract Bridge]], [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[Scrabble]].

===Titles and rankings===
{{Main|Chess titles}}
[[File:Garri kasparow 20070318.jpg|thumb|right|[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Garry Kasparov]], former [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]]]]
The best players can be awarded specific lifetime titles by the world chess organization FIDE:<ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate=2008-11-26
}}</ref>
*''[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]]'' (shortened as GM, sometimes ''International Grandmaster'' or IGM is used) is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an Elo chess rating (see below) of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results (called norms) in tournaments involving other Grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are also other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.
*''[[International Master]]'' (shortened as IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.
*''[[FIDE Master]]'' (shortened as FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE Rating of 2300 or more.
*''[[Candidate Master]]'' (shortened as CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE Rating of at least 2200.
All the titles are open to men and women. Separate women-only titles, such as Woman Grandmaster (WGM), are also available. Beginning with [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] in 1978, a number of women have earned the GM title, and most of the top ten women in 2006 hold the unrestricted GM title.<ref name="FIDE_top_players">Current FIDE lists of top players with their titles are online at<br>{{cite web

International titles are awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems, and to correspondence chess players (by the International Correspondence Chess Federation). Moreover, national chess organizations may also award titles, usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles; an example is the [[Chess expert]] title used in the United States.

In order to rank players, FIDE, [[ICCF]] and national chess organizations use the [[Elo rating system]] developed by [[Arpad Elo]]. Elo is a [[Statistical model|statistical system]] based on assumption that the chess performance of each player in their games is a random variable. Arpad Elo thought of a player's true skill as the average of that player's performance random variable, and showed how to estimate the average from results of player's games. The [[US Chess Federation]] implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems; it was adopted by FIDE in 1970.<ref>For the official process see:<br>{{cite web

The game structure and nature of chess is related to several branches of mathematics. Many [[combinatorics|combinatorical]] and [[topology|topological]] problems connected to chess were known of for hundreds of years. In 1913, [[Ernst Zermelo]] used it as a basis for his theory of game strategies, which is considered as one of the predecessors of [[game theory]].<ref>Zermelo, Ernst (1913), Uber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels, Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Mathematicians 2, 501-4.

The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be between 10<sup>43</sup> and 10<sup>50</sup>, with a [[game-tree complexity]] of approximately 10<sup>123</sup>. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by [[Claude Shannon]] as 10<sup>120</sup>, a number known as the [[Shannon number]].<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chess.html Chess.] ''Mathworld.Wolfram.com''. Retrieved 5 December 2006.</ref> Typically an average position has thirty to forty possible moves, but there may be as few as zero (in the case of checkmate or stalemate) or as many as 218.<ref>{{cite web

The most important mathematical challenge of chess is the development of [[algorithm]]s which can play chess. The idea of creating a chess playing machine dates to the 18th century; around 1769, the chess playing [[automaton]] called [[The Turk]] became famous before being exposed as a [[hoax]].<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Serious trials based on [[automaton]]s, such as [[El Ajedrecista]], were too complex and limited to be useful.

Since the advent of the [[digital computer]] in the 1950s, chess enthusiasts and [[computer engineer]]s have built, with increasing degrees of seriousness and success, chess-playing machines and computer programs. The groundbreaking paper on computer chess, "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess", was published in 1950 by Shannon.<ref>[[Alan Turing]] also made an attempt in 1953:<br>{{cite web

<blockquote>
The chess machine is an ideal one to start with, since: (1) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations (the moves) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate); (2) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution; (3) chess is generally considered to require "thinking" for skillful play; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of "thinking"; (4) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of

Nowadays chess programs compete in the [[World Computer Chess Championship]], held annually since 1974.

The general structure of a chess program is to search for moves and evaluate the resulting positions to find the best move. Many enhancements are necessary to achieve high performance. Some of those enhancements are [[minimax]], [[alpha-beta pruning]], [[killer heuristic]], [[iterative deepening depth-first search]], [[negascout]], [[MTD-f]], [[SSS*]], [[null-move heuristic]] and [[Late Move Reductions|late move reductions]].

With huge databases of past games and high analytical ability, computers also help players to learn chess and prepare for matches. Additionally, [[Internet Chess Server]]s allow people to find and play opponents all over the world. The presence of computers and modern communication tools have also raised concerns regarding [[cheating]] during games, most notably the "[[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006#Bathroom controversy|bathroom controversy]]" during the 2006 World Championship.

}}</ref> According to de Groot, this [[perception]], made possible by years of practice and study, is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot also showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not, alone, account for this skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.<ref>Richards J. Heuer, Jr. ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'' Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency 1999 (see [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art6.html Chapter 3]).</ref>

In addition, the role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to a lot of research recently.
