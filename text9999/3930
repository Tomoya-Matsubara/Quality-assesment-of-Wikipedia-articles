'''''Pulse''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer<U+2013>songwriter [[Toni Braxton]], released May 4, 2010, on [[Atlantic Records]]. It is her first album in five years and serves as her debut for the Atlantic label after signing a new record deal. Production for the album took place during September 2008 to March 2010 and was handled by several record producers, including [[David Foster]], [[Harvey Mason, Jr.]], [[DJ Frank E|Frank E]], [[Oak (producer)|Oak]], [[Lucas Secon]], and [[Dapo Torimiro]]. ''Pulse'' features up-tempo songs and R&B ballads with production varying from smooth to [[Electronic dance music|dance]]-based styles.

The album debuted at number nine on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 54,000 copies in its first week. It became Braxton's fifth US top-ten album and produced three singles that achieved moderate chart success. Upon its release, ''Pulse'' received generally positive reviews from most music critics.

==Background==
In October 2009 [[Atlantic Records]] chairman Craig Kallaman revealed that the label had signed Braxton and had the following to say "Last year [2008], we had the rare opportunity to bring another R&B icon into the Atlantic family, and for me it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Toni Braxton is not only one of the greatest voices of all time, but she is a charismatic superstar with an incredible list of achievements."<ref name=rapup1/>

Production for the album took place during September 2008 to March 2010 and was handled by several record producers, including [[David Foster]], [[Harvey Mason, Jr.]], [[DJ Frank E|Frank E]], [[Oak (producer)|Oak]], [[Lucas Secon]], and [[Dapo Torimiro]].<ref name=digispyinterview/><ref name="amazon">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Pulse-Toni-Braxton/dp/B002VZC9I8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1269816921&sr=8-1 |title=Pulse: Toni Braxton: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref> The entertainment outlet ''[[Rap-Up]]'' revealed that Braxton's album would feature collaborations with [[Lucas Secon]]; [[Harvey Mason, Jr.]]; [[Oak (producer)|Warren "Oak" Felder]]; and [[Troy Taylor (producer)|Troy Taylor]]<ref name=rapup1>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/10/30/toni-braxton-album-due-in-february/ |title=Toni Braxton Album Due in February |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref> as well as collaborations with [[Robin Thicke]], [[Trey Songz]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]<ref name=usher>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/02/11/toni-braxton-eyes-usher-collaboration-explains-album-delay/ |title=Toni Braxton Eyes Usher Collaboration, Explains Album Delay |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref> and other reported collaborations included [[Claude Kelly]], [[DJ Frank E|Frank E]], [[Steve Mac]], [[Dapo Torimiro]] and [[David Foster]].<ref name=rapup1/> R&B songwriter and singer [[Ne-Yo]] also worked on songs for the album.<ref name=rapup3>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/01/03/new-music-shanell-toni-braxton-jesse-mccartney/#more-35011 |title=New Music: Shanell, Toni Braxton, & Jesse McCartney |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref>

Speaking of the thinking behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis - Deputy Editor of [[Blues & Soul]] - in May 2010: "It comes from when I  got ill. I went into cardic rehab, and there was this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope - the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again - her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life."<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/538/ms_impulsive/ Toni Braxton interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' May 2010]</ref>
  
==Music==
She explained in an interview with [[Digital Spy]] that she had recorded around 30 songs and would like to collaborate with [[Alicia Keys]].<ref name=digispyinterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/interviews/a210255/toni-braxton.htmlM |title=Music - Interview - Toni Braxton |publisher=Digital Spy |date= |accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref> Braxton also explained the delay of the album: "The album was supposed to come out in February, but we held it back because seven of the ten songs we picked were leaked. We decided to go back to the studio, record four or five more songs and then pick. Now we send everything via Federal Express - nothing's going through the internet - and that's why none of the new songs have leaked so far."<ref name=digispyinterview/> The song "Woman" is a cover version of the original song by [[Delta Goodrem]] from her 2007 album ''[[Delta (Delta Goodrem album)|Delta]]''.<ref name="We Are Pop Slags">[http://www.wearepopslags.com/toni-braxton-not-enough-woman-new-song/ Woman Enough]"www.werarepopslags.co.uk".
