'''Youngstown''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]] and the administrative center of [[Mahoning County, Ohio|Mahoning County]]. The municipality is situated on the [[Mahoning River]], approximately {{convert|65|mi|km|0}} southeast of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and {{convert|61|mi|km|-2}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].{{GR|6}}  Youngstown has its own metropolitan area, but the [[Pittsburgh Tri-State]] and [[Greater Cleveland]] influence the region. Youngstown lies {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} west of the [[Pennsylvania]] state line. It lies midway between [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].

The city was named for [[John Young (pioneer)|John Young]], an early settler from [[Whitestown, New York]], who established the community's first sawmill and [[gristmill]].<ref name="ysu-communities">{{cite web

== Origins ==
[[Image:dtod.jpg|left|thumb|Governor David Tod]]

Youngstown was named for New York native John Young, who surveyed the area in 1796 and settled there soon after.<ref name="vind-yo-10-15-24">
{{cite news
  | title = Knowing Youngstown: John Young's Land Purchase

}}</ref> On [[February 9]], [[1797]], Young purchased the township of 15,560&nbsp;acres (63&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) from the [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve Land Company]] for $16,085.<ref>Aley (1975), pp. 28&ndash;29.</ref> The 1797 establishment of Youngstown was officially recorded on [[August 19]], [[1802]].<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 15&ndash;16.</ref>

The area that constitutes present-day Youngstown was part of the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], a section of the [[Northwest Territory]] reserved for settlers from the state of [[Connecticut]].<ref name="Blue13">Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 13.</ref> While many of the area's early settlers were natives of Connecticut, Youngstown attracted a substantial number of [[Scots-Irish]] settlers from neighboring [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 16&ndash;17.</ref> The first European Americans to settle permanently in the area were Pittsburgh native James Hillman and wife Catherine Dougherty.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 15.</ref> By 1798, Youngstown was the home of several families who were concentrated near the point where Mill Creek meets the Mahoning River.<ref name="Blue13"/> 

As the Western Reserve's population grew, the need for administrative districts became apparent. In 1800, territorial governor [[Arthur St. Clair]] established Trumbull County (named in honor of Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]]), and designated the smaller settlement of Warren as its administrative center, or "[[county seat]]".<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 17&ndash;18.</ref> In 1813, Trumbull County was divided into townships, with Youngstown Township comprising much of what became Mahoning County.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 18.</ref> The village of Youngstown was incorporated in 1848, and in 1867 Youngstown was chartered as a city. It became the county seat in 1876, when the administrative center of Mahoning County was moved from neighboring [[Canfield, Ohio|Canfield]].<ref>Aley (1975), pp. 98&ndash;99.</ref>

The discovery of coal by the community in the early 1800s paved the way for the Youngstown area's inclusion on the network of the famed [[Erie Canal]]. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 33&ndash;35.</ref> Local industrialist [[David Tod]], who was later Ohio governor during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], persuaded [[Lake Erie]] steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The arrival of the railroad in 1856 smoothed the path for further economic growth.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 35&ndash;36.</ref>

[[Image:YoungstownOhio1910s.jpg|thumb|right|Youngstown, 1910s: Central Square and Viaduct (view looking south).]]
Youngstown's industrial development changed the face of the Mahoning Valley. The community's burgeoning coal industry drew scores of immigrants from [[Wales]], [[Germany]], and [[Ireland]]. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]], [[Italy]], and [[Greece]].<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 69.</ref> In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine]], and [[Syria]]. By the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a racist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of [[Ku Klux Klan]] activity.<ref>Jenkins (1990), p. 19.</ref> The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] Americans in neighboring [[Niles, Ohio|Niles]] led Ohio Governor [[A. Victor Donahey]] to declare martial law.<ref>Jenkins (1990), p. 137.</ref> By 1928, however, the Klan was in steep decline; and three years later, the organization sold its Canfield, Ohio, meeting area, Kountry Klub Field.<ref>Aley (1975), p. 259.</ref> Today, the metropolitan area's ethnic diversity is reflected in businesses such as [[Jew|Jewish]] [[delicatessen]]s, Italian eateries, and [[Middle East|Middle Eastern]] restaurants. Urban neighborhoods are dotted with [[church|churches]], [[synagogue]]s, and [[mosque]]s.

The growth of industry attracted people from within the borders of the United States, and from [[Latin America]]. By the late 19th century, [[African Americans]] were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] was established in 1871.<ref name="Aley46">Aley (1975), p. 46.</ref> In the 1880s, local attorney [[William R. Stewart]] was the second African American elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].<ref>Aley (1975), p. 47.</ref> A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national [[Steel Strike of 1919]], local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the [[Southern United States|South]], many of whom were Black.<ref>Brody (1960), pp. 254&ndash;255.</ref> This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace.<ref>Bruno (1999), pp. 155&ndash;156.</ref><ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), p. 42.</ref> Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative [[sharecropping]] system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.<ref>Lemann (1991), pp. 3&ndash;58.</ref> 

The city's population became more diverse in the post-[[World War II]] era, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers.<ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 41&ndash;42.</ref> In the 1950s, the [[Hispanics in the United States|Latino]] population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, [[St. Rose of Lima]] [[Roman Catholic]] Church and the First Spanish [[Baptist]] Church of Ohio were among the largest religious institutions for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area.<ref name="Aley46"/> While diversity is among the community's enduring characteristics, the industrial economy that drew various groups to the area collapsed in the late 1970s. In response to subsequent challenges, the city has taken well-publicized steps to diversify economically, while building on some traditional strengths.<ref name="nasser">{{cite news

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 88.7&nbsp;[[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]] (34.2&nbsp;[[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]); 87.8&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (33.9&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) of it is land and 0.9&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (0.3&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) of it is water. The total area is 1.02%&nbsp;water.

Youngstown is in the [[Mahoning Valley]] on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]]. At the end of the last [[Ice Age]], the [[glacier]]s left behind a uniform plain, with valleys such as that caused by the [[Mahoning River]] traversing the plain.<ref name="Aley89">Aley (1975), pp. 8&ndash;9.</ref> Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.<ref name="Aley89"/>

According to the 2000 Census numbers, Youngstown has 32,177 households, and 19,724 families in the city. The population density is 893/km<U+00B2> (2,312.9/mi<U+00B2>). There are 37,159 housing units at an average density of 423.2/km<U+00B2> (1,096.3/mi<U+00B2>).<ref name="areaconnect">{{cite web | url = http://youngstown.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm | title = Youngstown, Ohio, Statistics and Demographics (U.S. Census 2000) | publisher = AreaConnect | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> 

The racial makeup of the city is roughly 51% White, 44% Black or African American, and 5% [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or Latino of any race, though [[Puerto Ricans]] are the dominant Spanish-speaking group.<ref name="areaconnect"/>

Records suggest that 27.2% of the households have children under the age of 18. Of these, 33.2% are married couples living together, 22.9% have a female householder with no husband present, and 38.7% are non-families. Meanwhile, 34.0% of all households comprise a single person, and 14.7% of households comprise a person over 65 years of age living alone. The average household size is 2.39 and the average family size is 3.07.<ref name="areaconnect"/>

In Youngstown, the population leans toward greater numbers of youths, as is often the case in U.S. inner-city areas with higher [[birth rates]]. Survey data show the following: 25.8% under the age of 18, 10.1% from 18 to 24, 26.4% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 17.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 36 years. For every 100 females, there are 91.9 males; for every 100 females aged 18 and over, there are 87.8 males.<ref name="areaconnect"/>

The median household income is $24,201, and the median family income $30,701; but the average per capita income for the city is $13,293. Males have a median income of $29,900 and females $21,050. About 25% of the population lives below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 37.3% of those under the age of 18 and 13.3% of those 65 and older are living below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]].<ref name="areaconnect"/>

The [[United States Census Bureau]]'s 2006 Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement Current Population Survey estimates a medium household income of $21,850. Analysis by CNNMoney states that Youngstown has the lowest median income of U.S. cities with more than 65,000 residents.<ref name="cnnmoney">{{cite web | author = Christie, Les |url = http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/28/real_estate/wealthiest_states/index.htm |title = The richest (and poorest) places in the U.S. |publisher = CNN |date=[[August 31]] [[2007]] |accessdate = 2007-09-01}}</ref>

== Industry and business ==
[[Image:sheet&tube.jpg|left|thumb|Youngstown Sheet & Tube and Viaduct]]
Endowed with substantial deposits of coal and iron as well as "old growth" hardwood forests needed to produce charcoal, the Youngstown area eventually developed a thriving steel industry. The area's first blast furnace was established to the east of town in 1803 by James and Daniel Heaton.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 20.</ref> In time, the wide availability of fossil fuels contributed to the development of other coal-fired mills, including the Youngstown Rolling Mill Company, which was established in 1846.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 42.</ref> By the mid-19th century, Youngstown was the site of several iron industrial plants, notably David Tod's [[Brier Hill]] Iron & Coal Company.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 37.</ref> The iron industry continued to expand in the 1890s, despite the depletion of local natural resources. Numerous rail connections ensured a consistent supply of coal and iron ore from neighboring states.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 66&ndash;67.</ref>

During the same period, local industrialists began to convert to steel manufacturing, amid a wave of industrial consolidations that placed much of the Mahoning Valley's industry in the hands of national corporations.<ref name="Blue94">Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 94.</ref> Shortly after the establishment of [[U.S. Steel]] in 1901, the corporate entity absorbed Youngstown's premier steel producer, the National Steel Company.<ref name="Blue94"/> One year earlier, however, a group of city investors took steps to ensure high levels of local ownership in the area's industrial sector. Led by local industrialists [[George D. Wick]] and [[James A. Campbell]], they established what became the [[Youngstown Sheet and Tube|Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company]],<ref name="Blue94"/> among the nation's most important steel producers.<ref name="Fuechtmann16">Fuechtmann (1989), p. 16.</ref> The firm significantly expanded its operations in 1923, when it acquired plants in [[South Chicago]] and [[East Chicago, Indiana]]. This impulse toward local ownership surfaced again in 1931, when Campbell, as chairman of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, attempted to merge the firm with [[Bethlehem Steel]], in a bid to create the nation's second largest steel corporation.<ref name="vind-yo-09-21-33b">

In the late 1930s, the community's steel sector received national attention once again, when Youngstown became a site of the so-called "Little Steel Strike", an effort by the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]], a precursor to [[United Steelworkers]], to secure contract agreements with smaller steel companies".<ref name="shellock">{{cite news

=== Decline of steel ===
Between the 1920s and 1960s, the city was known as an important industrial hub, which featured the massive furnaces and foundries of such companies as Republic Steel and U.S. Steel. At the same time, Youngstown never became as economically diversified as did larger industrial cities such as Chicago, Pittsburgh, Akron, or Cleveland.<ref name="Fuechtmann16">Fuechtmann (1989), p. 16.</ref> Hence, when economic changes forced the closure of plants throughout the 1970s, the city was left with few substantial economic alternatives. Some observers have cited a 1969 corporate merger between the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company and the [[New Orleans]]-based Lykes Corporation as a turning point in the demise of the local steel industry.<ref name="Fuechtmann4143">Fuechtmann (1989), pp. 41&ndash;43.</ref> The merger and subsequent takeover of Youngstown Sheet and Tube burdened the community's primary steel producer with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.<ref name="Fuechtmann4143"/> Further, the deal placed control of the company outside of the Mahoning Valley.<ref name="Fuechtmann4143"/> The [[September 19]], [[1977]], announcement of the closure of a large portion of Youngstown Sheet and Tube, an event still remembered by many Youngstowners as "[[Black Monday]]", is widely regarded as the death knell of the old area steel industry. This was followed by the withdrawal of U.S. Steel in 1979 and 1980, and the bankruptcy of Republic Steel in the mid-1980s.<ref>Bruno (1999), pp. 9&ndash;10.</ref> Attempts to revive the local steel industry proved unsuccessful. Shortly after the closure of most of Youngstown Sheet and Tube's area operations, local religious leaders, steelworkers, and activists such as [[Staughton Lynd]] participated in a grassroots effort to purchase and refurbish one of the company's abandoned plants in neighboring [[Campbell, Ohio]].<ref name="Fuechtmann5">Fuechtmann (1989), p. 5.</ref> This project met with failure in April 1979.<ref name="Fuechtmann5"/> In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns, the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs, 400 satellite businesses, $414 million in personal income, and from 33 to 75 percent of the school tax revenues.<ref>Bruno (1999), p. 149.</ref> The Youngstown area has yet to fully recover from the loss of jobs in the steel sector.<ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 131&ndash;132.</ref>

=== Post-steel economy ===
Youngstown is the site of several steel and metalworking operations, though nothing on the scale seen during the "glory days" of the "Steel Valley." One of the largest current employers in the city is [[Youngstown State University]] (YSU), an urban public campus that serves about 13,000 students.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.regionalchamber.com/local-largestempl.htm | title = Youngstown-Warren area largest employers | publisher = Youngstown-Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce | accessdate = 2007-02-18}}</ref> The blow dealt to the community's industrial economy in the 1970s, however, was mitigated by the continued presence of auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the [[Avanti]], an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by [[Studebaker]] to compete with the [[Corvette]], was manufactured in an industrial complex located on Youngstown's Albert Street.<ref name="Avanti">{{cite journal |last=Washington |first=Frank |year=1989 |month=April 3 |title=Buffing Up an Old Classic<U+2013>Avanti Drives Again |journal=Newsweek |volume=CXIII |pages=p. 46 |accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>

Today, the largest industrial employer in the metropolitan area is [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' [[Lordstown Assembly]] plant.<ref name="GM"/>  One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of area, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and [[Cavalier]]. Recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility, it is the current home of the Cavalier's successor, the [[Chevrolet Cobalt]].<ref name="GM">Lyne, Jack (2002).

Retrieved on [[2007-03-08]]</ref> [[Delphi Corporation|Delphi]], Packard Electric Systems, and the WCI Steel plant are also located in the Warren area. The largest industrial employers within the Youngstown city limits are V&M Star Steel Company (formerly North Star Steel), in the Brier Hill district, and Exal Corporation, located on Poland Avenue. The latter has recently expanded its operations.<ref>{{cite web

=== New growth ===
[[Image:Youngstown003.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Youngstown at night]]
Youngstown's downtown, which once underscored the community's economic difficulties, is now a site of new business growth. The [[business incubator|Youngstown Business Incubator]], located in the heart of the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies, which have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities.<ref name="shilling">{{cite news

}}</ref> Some of the companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are beginning to outgrow their current space. In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the incubator secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006.<ref name="shilling"/> Meanwhile, the downtown has retained its traditional role as the community's financial center. Several banks, including [[JP Morgan Chase]], [[National City Corp.|National City]], [[Huntington Bancshares|Huntington]], and [[FNB Corporation|First National Bank]] have offices in the city; and the Youngstown-based Home Savings & Loan is headquartered there.

=== Legacy of innovation ===
Extensive coverage of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number of products and enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based [[Schwebel's Bakery]], which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 1900s. The company now distributes bread products nationally.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.schwebels.com/about.asp | title = It all began in 1906, in a small kitchen in Campbell, Ohio... | publisher = Schwebel's Baking Company | accessdate = 2007-02-17

(1995), p. 176</ref> The [[fast-food]] chain, [[Arby's]], opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and [[Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips]] was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s.

===Post-steel image in popular culture===
For a large segment of the American public, however, Youngstown continues to be associated with the economic malaise that befell much of the industrial northeast following the collapse of its manufacturing sector. The decline of Youngstown's steel industry and its devastating impact on local workers were famously treated in [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ballad, "Youngstown", featured on his ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]'' album.<ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 1&ndash;2.</ref> Springsteen included Youngstown as a stop on his subsequent [[Ghost of Tom Joad Tour]].

== Government ==
Youngstown is governed by a [[List of mayors of Youngstown, Ohio|mayor]] who is elected every four years and limited to a maximum of two terms. Mayors are traditionally inaugurated on or around the second of January. For complex reasons, the city has tended to elect [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] mayors since the late 1920s.<ref>Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 113.</ref> Youngstown's current mayor is [[Jay Williams (politician)|Jay Williams]], the city's first African-American mayor and its first [[Independent (politician)|independent]] mayor since 1922.<ref name="skolnick">{{cite news

The coalition is co-chaired by [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] and [[New York City|New York]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].<ref name="noguns"/>

Residents elect an eight-member city council, which includes representatives of the city's seven wards and a council president. The council, in turn, appoints a city clerk. The council traditionally meets every first and third Wednesday of the month. City council meetings are generally held from the third week in September to the third week in June. Meanwhile, the board of control oversees contracts for public projects within the municipal limits. The Youngstown Police Department and [[Youngstown Fire Department]] fall under the board's supervision, as do the parks, civil service, community development, health, planning, and water departments. 

Youngstown's finance department oversees all municipal finances and supervises the departments of economic development and income tax. The city's department of public works has sweeping supervisory responsibilities and oversees the departments of engineering, building inspection, building and grounds, signal and sign, demolition and housing, litter and recycling, street, and water waste treatment. The city's law department represents the city on all legal issues, serving as counsel to all municipal departments.

== Education ==
===Public===
The [[Youngstown City Schools]] manage all public education within the city. As of 2007, the school district was engaged in a process of reconfiguration, consolidating existing schools while building some new ones. District high schools once included [[Chaney High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Chaney]], [[Rayen High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Rayen]], [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Woodrow Wilson]], Youngstown Early College, and Choffin Career and Technical Center. This roster has changed, however.

Youngstown hosts a small number of charter schools and one [[Montessori]] school. The Montessori School of the Mahoning Valley, which recently celebrated its 30th year, offers alternative learning environments for students ranging from preschool to eighth grade.<ref>[http://www.montessori-youngstown.com/about.htm About our school.] The Montessori School of the Mahoning Valley.

=== Higher education ===
[[Image:JonesHall.jpg|thumb|right|Youngstown State University's Jones Hall]]
Youngstown State University, the primary institution of higher learning in the Youngstown-Warren metropolitan area, traces its origins to a local [[YMCA]] program that began offering college-level courses in 1908.<ref name="vindy-10-14-07"/> YSU joined the Ohio system of higher education in 1967.<ref name="vindy-10-14-07">{{cite news

The Youngstown<U+2013>Warren area also hosts a regional branch of [[Kent State University]]. Kent State<U+2013>Trumbull was established in the mid-1960s in [[Champion Township, Trumbull County, Ohio|Champion, Ohio]], just north of Warren. Yet another branch, Kent State-Salem, is located in the [[Steel Valley]] and serves the area's southlands. It is located about 25&nbsp;minutes south of Youngstown. [[Kent State University]]'s expansive main campus, a primary center of education for [[Northeast Ohio]]ans, is located just east of Akron, and 30 to 40&nbsp;minutes west of downtown Youngstown.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kent.edu| title=Kent State University Homepage|publisher=Kent State University|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>

Downtown Youngstown is the site of the [[Oakland Center for the Arts]], a venue for locally produced plays. This institution is complimented by the [[Youngstown Playhouse]], located on the city's south side. As Mahoning County's primary community theater, the Youngstown Playhouse has served the area for more than 80 years, despite intermittent financial challenges. Famous theatrical personalities from the Youngstown area include comedic actor [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]],<ref name="vindy-yo-07-20-74">{{cite news

===Museums=== 
Youngstown's most widely known museum is the [[Butler Institute of American Art]]. In 1919, the institution was established by industrialist [[Joseph G. Butler, Jr.]], as the first museum in the country dedicated to American art.<ref>{{cite web
   | url = http://www.butlerart.com/ | title = About the Butler | publisher = Butler Institute of American Art | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref> The Butler is located near Youngstown State University's campus, just north of the downtown area. Directly across the street from the Butler stands the McDonough Museum of Art, which was established in 1991. Owned and operated by Youngstown State University, the McDonough showcases contemporary art and hosts programs for students on campus and throughout the surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mcdonoughmuseum.ysu.edu/ | title = McDonough Museum of Art | publisher = Youngstown State University | accessdate = 2007-02-18

[[Image:Youngstown 021.jpg|thumb|right|The Butler Institute of American Art]]
Within walking distance of the institutions mentioned above is the Arms Family Museum of Local History. The museum, housed in a 1905 [[American Craftsman|Arts & Crafts style]] mansion on the main artery of Wick Avenue, is managed by the Mahoning Valley Historical Society. Once the estate of a local industrialist, the museum maintains period rooms that showcase the original contents of the household, including furnishings, art objects, and personal artifacts. The museum mounts rotating exhibits on topics related to local history. Recently, the museum opened the "Anne Kilcawley Christman Hands-on History Room". The MVHS Archival Library operates in the estate's former carriage house, located near the back of the site.

Located just south of the YSU campus is the Youngstown Historical Center of Industry and Labor, which sits on a grade overlooking the downtown area. This museum, owned and operated by the [[Ohio Historical Society]], focuses on the Mahoning Valley's history of steel production.<ref>{{cite web

===Parks===
Youngstown's most popular resource is Mill Creek Park, a five-mile-long stretch of landscaped woodland reminiscent of [[Rock Creek Park]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Mill Creek Park is the oldest park district in Ohio, established as a township park in 1891. The park's highlights include the restored 19th&nbsp;century Lanterman's Mill, the dramatic rock formations of Bear's Den, scores of nature trails, the [[Fellows Riverside Gardens]] and Nature Center, and the "Cinderella" iron link bridge.<ref name="mvhs">{{cite web
   | url = http://www.mahoninghistory.org/wdyk21-park.htm |title = Mahoning Valley Historical Society page on Mill Creek Park| publisher = Mahoning Valley Historical Society|accessdate = 2007-02-17}}</ref>
[[Image:cinderellabridge.jpg|left|thumb|Mill Creek Park's "Cinderella" iron link bridge]] It encompasses approximately 2,600&nbsp;acres, 20&nbsp;miles of drives, and 15&nbsp;miles of foot trails, and a rare collection of gardens, streams, lakes, woodlands, meadows and wildlife.
The Nature Center's popular lookout point provides visitors with contrasting views of the area. From the south side, the canopied woodlands overlooking Lake Glacier are visible; from the north side, viewers are presented with a scenic view of downtown Youngstown. In addition, the park features two 18-hole golf courses. The North Course is situated on rolling terrain, while the South Course features narrow, tree-lined fairways.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.millcreekmetroparks.com/golf.htm | title = Championship Golf | publisher = Mill Creek Metro Parks| accessdate = 2007-11-02
}}</ref>  In addition, it offers playgrounds, athletic fields, picnic areas and other recreational spaces. 

In 2005, the park was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="vind-yo-06-14-2006">

A smaller recreational area called [[Wick Park]] is located on the historic north side.  Wick Park's periphery is lined with early 20th-century mansions that were built by the city's industrialists, business leaders, and professionals during Youngstown's "boom" years.<ref name="pellegrini"/>  Stambaugh Auditorium, a popular venue for concerts and other public events, is located near the park's southwestern edge.<ref name="stam"/>  Several cemeteries (notably historic Oak Hill Cemetery) and small recreational spaces are scattered throughout the city.

===Sports===
Youngstown has enjoyed a long tradition of professional and semi-professional sports.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.centerforworkingclassstudies.org/uploads/Documents/Baseball.html | title = Company Sports Teams and the Early Industrialization of Youngstown, Ohio | publisher = Youngstown State University | accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref> In earlier decades, the city produced scores of minor league baseball teams, including the [[Youngstown Ohio Works]], [[Youngstown Champs]], [[Youngstown Indians]], [[Youngstown Steelmen]], [[Youngstown Browns]], [[Youngstown Gremlins]], and Youngstown Athletics.

Youngstown's Chevrolet Centre is the home to the [[Youngstown Steelhounds]] hockey team, who play in the [[Central Hockey League|CHL]].

The current minor league baseball team just outside of the city is the [[Mahoning Valley Scrappers]], which are the single-A short season affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. The Scrappers compete in the [[New York-Penn League]] and play their games at [[Eastwood Field]] in neighboring Niles, Ohio. Since their first season of play in 1999, the Scrappers have become a successful franchise in minor league baseball.

Meanwhile, the community has an unbroken tradition of collegiate sports, which is exemplified by the Youngstown State University Penguins, a major regional draw. The football team, which competes in the [[Gateway Football Conference]], is among the most storied and successful in 1-AA football. The Penguins play in [[Stambaugh Stadium]] and enjoy one of the most supportive fan bases in Division 1 FCS football. All other YSU athletic teams compete in the [[Horizon League]]. The Youngstown State men and women's basketball teams hold their games at Youngstown State's [[Beeghly Center]]. The teams average about 2500 fans per game, a number which has been on the rise the past two seasons with a new style of play under Head Coach Jerry Slocum. Meanwhile, the YSU baseball and softball teams have enjoyed both local support and success, with the baseball team reaching the NCAA super-regionals in 2005 and the softball team doing so in 2006.<ref name="ysusports">{{cite web |url = http://www.ysu.edu/sports|title = YSU Sports Homepage |publisher = Youngstown State University |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}</ref>

In addition, Youngstown is well-known for the number of [[boxing]] champions it has produced.  These include bantamweight [[Greg Richardson]], lightweights [[Ray Mancini]] and [[Harry Arroyo]], middleweight [[Kelly Pavlik]], and cruiserweight [[Jeff Lampkin]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

=== Building on tradition ===
One of the city's most recent sports-related attractions is the [[Chevrolet Centre]] (formerly the Youngstown Convocation Center), which was funded primarily through a $26 million federal grant. Located on the site of an abandoned steel mill, the impressive, high-tech facility opened in October 2005.<ref name="skolnick3">{{cite news

The city plans to develop vacant land adjacent to the Centre. Plans included using the space for a park, riverwalk (the Mahoning River flows through the site), amphitheater, or athletic stadium for the city's public and private high schools.

Such investments reflect wide appreciation of Youngstown's athletic tradition, which has produced noted figures in a variety of sports.

=== Former attractions ===
Several of the city's treasured recreational resources failed to survive the economic hardships that came in the late 1970s. The most notable of these was ''[[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]],'' an amusement park that served as a pleasant alternative to Youngstown residents who preferred not to travel to some of the larger parks located in Northern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. (These included ''[[Conneaut Lake Park]]'' in [[Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania]], ''[[Geauga Lake]]'' in [[Aurora, Ohio]], ''[[Cedar Point]]'' in [[Sandusky, Ohio]], and ''[[Kennywood]]'' in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].) Beyond its sentimental value, the park, which closed in 1984, enjoyed a degree of historical significance. Former Youngstown resident [[Jack Warner]] noted in his autobiography that the famed [[Warner Bros.|Warner brothers]]' first step into the movie business came when they screened a worn copy of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' at ''Idora Park'' and other local venues.<ref>Warner (1964), pp. 49&ndash;54.</ref>

From the early 1900s to the mid-1970s, Youngstown served as the retail center of the Mahoning Valley. There were formerly two flagship department stores in the downtown area, including [[Strouss|Strouss Hirshberg's]] (later absorbed by [[Kaufmann's]], now part of [[Macy's]]) and  McKelvey's (later [[Higbee's]], now part of [[Dillard's]]). Specialty shops once lined the main artery of West Federal Street, and the district had four upscale [[movie theater]]s, including the Palace Theater, the Warner Brothers' Theater, the State Theater, and the Paramount Theater. These businesses were the first to disappear amid declining attendance in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In the early 1970s, the appearance of two suburban malls (the [[Southern Park Mall]], in Boardman, and the [[Eastwood Mall (Niles)|Eastwood Mall]], in Niles) contributed to the closure or relocation of many of those businesses that survived. The collapse of the community's steel industry at the end of the decade sharpened challenges faced by downtown business owners; and throughout the 1980s and 1990s, efforts to revive the former retail hub proved fruitless.<ref>Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 42&ndash;46.</ref>

== Redevelopment ==
[[Image:Youngstown1 003.jpg|thumb|left|The George Voinovich Center (left) and Mahoning County Childrens Services Center (right) in downtown]]
The cityscape of Youngstown is remarkable for its relative dearth of newer buildings, and from certain angles, the downtown area may appear to have changed little since the 1960s. Yet downtown Youngstown has seen modest and steadily increasing levels of new construction in recent years. New additions include a state office complex (the [[George Voinovich]] Government Center) and two federal courthouses, (the [[Frank J. Battisti]] and [[Nathaniel R. Jones]] Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse) one of which features an award-winning design by the architectural firm, [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert A. M. Stern Architects]].<ref>{{cite web

In 2005, Federal Street, a major downtown thoroughfare that had been closed off to create a pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic. The downtown area has seen the razing of structurally unsound buildings, and the expansion and/or restoration of many others.<ref name="vindy-yo-09-21-06">{{cite news

=== Construction and business development ===
[[Image:Youngstown1 002.jpg|thumb|right|Recently re-opened Federal Street]]
In 2004, construction began on a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and a grant from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million [[New Urbanist]] revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park.<ref name="skolnick2">{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-02-14
}}</ref>  Construction for the project began in 2006.

New construction has dovetailed with efforts to cultivate business growth. One of the area's more successful business ventures in recent years has been the Youngstown Business Incubator. This nonprofit organization, based in a former downtown department store building, fosters the growth of fledgling technology-based companies. The incubator, which boasts more than a dozen business tenants, has begun construction on a multi-million dollar downtown technology center, where some of its largest firms will relocate.<ref name="shilling"/>

=== Crime control ===
Meanwhile, the city has attempted to come to terms with its troubling reputation for crime and corruption. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Youngstown was nationally identified with gangland slayings that were often committed with car bombs.<ref name="heltzel">{{cite news

Traficant Jr.]] on 10 counts of bribery, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to defraud the United States, filing a false tax return and racketeering.

===Renewal plan===
In line with these efforts to change the community's image, the city government, in partnership with the university, has organized an ambitious urban renewal plan titled Youngstown 2010. The stated goals of Youngstown 2010 include the creation of a "cleaner, greener, and better planned and organized Youngstown". In January 2005, the organization unveiled its "master plan", which took shape in the course of several public meetings that featured input from citizens. The plan, which received national attention, is consistent with efforts in other metropolitan areas to address the phenomenon of urban depopulation.<ref name="nasser"/> Given that the communities to the south and west of the city continue to enjoy a measure of economic prosperity, supporters of such projects hold out hope for the revitalization of Youngstown.

== Transportation ==
The Youngstown area is served by the Western Reserve Transit Authority (WRTA) bus system, which is supported through income tax. WRTA, whose main terminal is located in the downtown area, provides service throughout the city and into surrounding Mahoning and Trumbull counties. The downtown terminal serves as the Youngstown area's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] terminal.<ref>[http://www.wrtaonline.com/ WRTA Youngstown.] Western Reserve Transit Authority. Retrieved on [[2007-03-07]]</ref>

Located in the vicinity of the WRTA terminal is a former [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] station. The historic terminal building, which has been converted into a banquet hall, served as a train station from 1995 to 2005.<ref>[http://www.banquetatthebno.com/index2.html Rental information.] The B & O Station Banquet Hall. Retrieved on [[2007-03-07]]</ref> The local railroads now serve cargo trains exclusively. 

The only airport within the city limits is the [[Lansdowne Airport]], located on the city's east side. This facility is used for general aviation. The metropolitan area's main airport is the [[Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport]] ([[YNG]]), located in nearby [[Vienna, Ohio]]. The only commercial route available at this airport is a flight to [[Orlando, Florida]] through [[Allegiant Air]].<ref>[http://www.yngwrnair.com/index.html Homepage.] Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport Homepage (2006). Retrieved on [[2007-03-07]]</ref> Most valley residents take advantage of larger airports such as [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]], [[Akron-Canton Regional Airport]], and [[Pittsburgh International Airport]].

==Media==
Youngstown features diverse media, including television, print and radio. An important regional source of news is the daily newspaper, ''[[The Vindicator]]'', a broadsheet published by ''The Vindicator Publishing Company''. ''The Vindicator'' is the only regional newspaper that covers Mahoning, Trumbull, and Columbiana counties, as well as Western Pennsylvania. It has competitors such as the Warren-based ''Tribune Chronicle'', and the [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon]]-based ''Morning Journal'', however they primarily cover their respective counties, with limited coverage of Mahoning County and Youngstown. Other newspapers that print in Youngstown include bi-monthly ''The Business Journal'', ''The Metro Monthly'', and the bi-weekly ''The Jambar'', published by the students of Youngstown State University on Tuesdays and Thursdays while classes are in session.

Youngstown is served by ten television stations, three of which are low-power repeaters of TV stations in other cities.<ref>[http://radiostationworld.com/locations/United_States_of_America/Ohio/tv_information.asp?m=you Youngstown OH], RadioStationWorld.
