"'''A Tale of Two Springfields'''" is the second episode from [[The Simpsons (season 12)|season twelve]] of the animated TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and is the 250th episode of the series overall in both broadcast and production order. The episode originally premiered November 5, 2000 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. 

While calling Animal Control over a badger taking residence in [[Santa's Little Helper]]'s doghouse, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] discovers that Springfield has two different area codes<U+2014>and ends up leading a revolt that splits the town in two.

The episode was written by [[John Swartzwelder]] and directed by [[Shaun Cashman]] and guest starred [[The Who]]. The episode was inspired by Don Payne based on Don's mom area where one side would spread rumors of the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched it to have the both sides divide, because of area code. The episode features cultural references to [[The Who]] and [[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]] and has also received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
A [[badger]] takes up residence in [[Santa's Little Helper|Santa's Little Helper's]] doghouse. After several failed attempts to lure it out (including Homer crawling into the kennel, thinking it is Milhouse but gets attacked by the badger), [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] calls animal control. When he is unable to get through, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] explains that the phone company has introduced a new area code to [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Half of the town now has a 636 area code, the other has 939. At a town meeting to explain the change, Homer rallies an angry mob to protest the change, noting that the upper class side of town got to keep their area code while the poorer half were forced to switch. Homer proposes that the town split into two halves, and the mob agrees.

Homer is declared mayor of New Springfield and tensions immediately arise between the two towns. Olde Springfield businesses begin discriminating against customers from New Springfield, and condescending to them on the nightly news. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and Homer shut off power to Olde Springfield and cut off their water supply in retaliation. When the lack of water reveals gold in the river bed, making the town even richer, an enraged Homer has a wall built between the two towns. However, a lack of supplies and sanitation drives away all of the New Springfield residents, who stream over the wall, leaving the Simpsons alone.

Bitter, Homer attempts to sabotage a concert in Olde Springfield by [[The Who]]. He and Bart sneak into The Who's hotel room and convince them to play New Springfield instead. When Olde Springfield realizes that their concert has been stolen, they follow the sound of the music to the wall, where The Who are playing for an audience of The Simpsons. A riot begins to break out as the two sides of town begin hurling flaming garbage at each other. The members of The Who hear about the area code problem and suggest that the townspeople get [[speed dial]] to resolve their differences. [[Roger Daltrey]]'s scream from "[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]" crumbles the wall, and the citizens of Springfield reunite and dance to the music. Meanwhile the badger leads an animal invasion of the town to "get 'em while they're dancing".

After a number of calls were made by the show's casting director in [[Los Angeles]] to The Who's managers in [[London]], the group agreed to appear on the show. The animated versions of the band members included Daltrey in his trademark tight t-shirt and long curls, even though Daltrey cut the curls in the mid 1980's as they wanted to use the image The Who they are best known for. The Who recorded their lines in [[England]], but still weighed in on script details. During the production the staff decided to animate [[Keith Moon]] instead of the current drummer in honor of him since he died in 1978.<ref name="Seinfeld">{{cite video | people=Daltrey, Roger|date=2009|title=The Simpsons The Complete Twelfth Season DVD commentary for the episode "A Tale of Two Springfields"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>
