The '''St. Charles Air Line Bridge''' is a Strauss Trunnion [[bascule bridge]] which spans the [[Chicago River]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. 

Built as part of the [[St. Charles Air Line Railroad]] by the [[American Bridge Company]] in 1919, the bridge originally had a span of {{Convert|260|ft|m}}. This bridge held the world record for longest bascule-type span until 1930, when it was shortened to {{Convert|220|ft|m}} during a relocation as a result of straightening the river channel. The chief design engineer of the original bridge was Leonard O. Hopkins.
