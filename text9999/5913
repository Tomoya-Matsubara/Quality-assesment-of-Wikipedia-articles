==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words.-->

A young monster named Michael "Mike" Wazowski dreams of being a scarer (a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children so their screams can be harvested for energy) when he grows up, after visiting Monsters Inc.{{mdash}}Monstropolis' most profitable and best-known scaring company{{mdash}}on a school field trip. Eleven years later, Mike is a scare major at Monsters University, where he meets his new roommate, Randall "Randy" Boggs, and a large, blue, furry monster named James P. "Sulley" Sullivan.<ref name = "EW frat article">{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/23/monsters-university-billy-crystal-fraternity-revenge-of-the-nerds/|title='Monsters University': Billy Crystal explains the prequel's 'Revenge of the Nerds' connection|last=Smith|first=Grady|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref><ref name="SCHOOLED" />

Mike studies hard, while the privileged Sulley{{mdash}}who comes from a talented family of scarers{{mdash}}relies on his natural scaring ability and begins to falter. At the final exam, Mike and Sulley's rivalry makes Dean Hardscrabble fail them both and drop them from the program, prompting Roar Omega Roar to remove Sulley from their team. Mike decides to prove himself by entering the Scare Games, but Oozma Kappa{{mdash}}the only fraternity that was removed from the program{{mdash}}is denied entry as they are one team member short. Seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program, Sulley joins and Mike reluctantly accepts.

Oozma Kappa fails the first challenge, an obstacle course where the contestants dodge harmful, glowing "urchins," but miraculously advances when another team is disqualified for using protection gel, which violates the Scare Games' rules. The contestants attend Roar Omega Roar's party where the other competitors humiliate and discourage Oozma Kappa. Mike arranges a secret visit to Monsters, Inc. to lift their spirits, but Sulley still doubts that Mike can be a true scarer. Oozma Kappa places second in the following events. In the final round, they pull off a close victory cemented by a final decisive scare by Mike. Afterwards, Mike discovers that Sulley cheated to improve Mike's score. Determined to prove he is capable of becoming a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters a door to the human world, but the door leads to a summer camp and he is unable to scare a cabin full of children.

Back at the university, Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble that he cheated, just as she is notified of the break-in. Realizing what happened, Sulley enters the door to look for Mike. After finding and reconciling with him, they try to return but they find they are trapped in the human world because Hardscrabble has deactivated the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive.  Mike realizes that the only way to get back into the monster world is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the adults, generating an overwhelming amount of scream energy and allowing them to return to the lab. 

Their actions lead to their expulsion from the university, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester because Hardscrabble is impressed with their performance in the games. They share goodbyes and as Sulley and Mike leave, Hardscrabble tells them they are the first to have surprised her and wishes them luck for the future. Mike and Sulley begin work at Monsters, Inc. in the company mailroom under the mailroom manager, the [[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]. Working their way up through the company, the two eventually become part of the Scarer Team, thus setting the events of ''Monsters, Inc.'' in motion.

The plot of ''Monsters University'' details Mike and Sulley's first meeting, but this created a continuity error from the [[Monsters, Inc.|first film]] in which Mike tells Sulley that he has been jealous of his looks since the fourth grade. Director [[Dan Scanlon]] said he had a dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, "we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." He added, "It felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make ''Monsters Elementary.''" Scanlon said during pre-production that, "[[Pete Docter]], the original director, and [[John Lasseter]]&nbsp;...&nbsp;finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honouring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside." Scanlon also said the line from the first film is, "an old monster expression" and "That's what monsters always say to each other."<ref>[http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/monsters-university-continuity-error-mike-sulley-backstory-explained-005300640.html Monsters University continuity error in Mike and Sulley<U+2019>s backstory explained] Yahoo News U.K. Retrieved June 23, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.slashfilm.com/monsters-university-director-explains-the-continuity-problem-in-mike-and-sullys-backstory/ <U+2018>Monsters University<U+2019> Director Explains the Continuity Problem in Mike and Sully<U+2019>s Backstory] SlashFilm Retrieved June 23, 2013</ref><ref>[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/10/16/monsters-university-blu-ray-deleted-scene/ 'Monsters University' Blu-ray: See the fourth-grade Mike/Sulley meeting that never happened -- EXCLUSIVE VIDEO] Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved October 24, 2013</ref>

''Monsters University'' is the first Pixar film that used [[global illumination]], a new lighting system introduced as part of the overhaul of the rendering system used since the first ''[[Toy Story]]'' film. In the planning stage of the film, director of photography, Jean-Claude Kalache, asked "What if we made these lights just work?" Before the new system, artists had to build reflections and shadows manually, which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced. The new lighting system uses [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world; this automatized the process, delivered more realism, produced soft shadows, and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenes{{mdash}}some of which contained thousands of light sources.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brandom|first=Russsel|title=Throwing shade: how Pixar changed the way light works for 'Monsters University'|url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/21/4446606/how-pixar-changed-the-way-light-works-for-monsters-university|accessdate=June 23, 2013|newspaper=The Verge|date=June 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Desowitz|first=Bill|title=Shining a New Light on Pixar|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/films/shining-a-new-light-on-pixar|accessdate=June 24, 2013|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=May 2, 2013}}</ref>

On October 8, 2012, Pixar revealed a fully functional website for ''Monsters University'', complete with information about admissions, academic and campus life, and a campus store to purchase MU apparel.

Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying that it "never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best Pixar stories.
