'''Valley View Christian Church''' is a [[non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational Christian]] [[church (building)|church]] located in [[Dallas, Texas]]. It is a [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] church associated with the [[Restoration Movement]]. Its core beliefs are centered in the authority of the [[Bible]]. 

Valley View started in 1964. The church believes that its mission is to make disciples of all people and help them to become more like Christ. The church's leadership is defined as led by "elders" (1 Tim. 3) and the day to day operations are managed by the staff. Recently, Valley View has been striving to be a multi-generational (Titus 2:1-5) and multi-ethnic group of people (Rev. 7:9). In the future, the church hopes to include people from all walks of life, all ages, all ethnicities, united to serve God and people.

There have been prominent leaders who have attended Valley View in the past, including: Keith Ray (president of Lincoln Christian University) and U.S. Supreme Court Nominee [[Harriet Miers]] was a prominent member who was [[baptism|baptized]] at the church in 1979. She taught a children's [[Sunday school]] class early in her membership.

In September 2006, a Wall Street Journal article on the influence of Rick Warren cited Valley View as one of the American churches that has used Warren's ''Purpose Driven Life'' to help them communicate the biblical purposes of the church to the contemporary community in which they minister. Valley View is described as a church that has a love for the Bible, and a heart for people.
