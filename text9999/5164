'''LBC News 1152''' is London's only rolling news radio station. It broadcasts in [[Greater London]] on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media]] and online. 

==Programming==

The station broadcasts between 7am and 7pm on weekdays; from 7am to 6pm on Saturdays and between 7am and 5pm on Sundays. The evening and overnight service is a simulcast of sister station [[LBC 97.3]].

In January and February 2012 the station reverted to live presentation throughout the day. For the previous four years parts of the daytime schedule had been automated. 

The following month the station adopted a revised format with a new strapline: "London's news, travel and weather in 15 minutes, every 15 minutes". 

Every 15 minute segment includes news headlines, several longer news reports or interviews, a travel bulletin, sports headlines and (on weekdays) business news.

Weekend features include an events guide, movie news, a showbiz roundup and local newspaper reviews.

The station's suppliers include [[Sky News Radio]] and [[Trafficlink]].

==Presenters==
The station's weekday schedule is divided into three four-hour blocks with breakfast presented by Jim Diamond. Weekend presenters include Chloe Aust, Katy Murrells and Rupert Bhatia. 

Past presenters include: [[Luisa Baldini]], Rick Kelsey, Jamie Shepherd, Douglas Cameron, [[Peter Deeley]], [[Sandy Warr]], [[James Hirst (presenter)|James Hirst]], Maggie Doyle, James Hartigan, Declan Harvey, [[Sue Mansfield]], Kim Michaels, [[Russell Hookey]], Richard Midson, Clemency Norris, Richard Hakier and Jonathan Savage. Former Sky News anchorman [[Bob Friend (newscaster)|Bob Friend]] was a guest presenter on the station at the time of the 2005 [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|British general election]].

==History==
The frequency has a complicated history of format and ownership, most recently with the swap between 1152 AM and 97.3 FM. In January 2003 the station relaunched as LBC News 1152.

The history of continuous news radio in London dates back to the early 1990s. In September 1993 London News Radio was awarded the FM and AM licenses previously held by LBC. They proposed a continuous news service on FM and a news/talk format on AM.

By the time the license was due to start in October 1994 London News Radio had been through several upheavals, first acquiring LBC and then itself being bought up by [[Reuters]].

At launch on 5 October 1994 the company was known as London Radio Services and it operated London News 97.3FM and London News Talk 1152AM.

London News initially operated on a 20-minute wheel. The first presenters on air were Michael Wilson and Clare Catford. The morning sequence was presented by LBC veteran Jonathan Staples with Nicky Broyd the afternoon presenter. Drivetime was in the hands of Christopher Terry and Brenda Ellison. John Terrett was the evening host.

By spring 1995 the rolling news format gave way to a more traditional schedule of news sequences and magazine programmes.

In summer 1995 the station's name was shortened to News 97.3.

In 1996 Reuters sold London Radio Services to the newly formed London News Radio (unrelated to the previous LNR company), in which [[ITN]], [[DMGT]], Reuters and [[GWR Group]] held equal shares.

In summer 1996 the station reverted to a rolling news format, initially with no name (the station was branded as 97.3FM).

In autumn 1996 - following a move to ITN's headquarters - the station was relaunched as News Direct 97.3FM and Chris Mann was appointed editor.

In 2000 the station was renamed ITN News Direct 97.3FM

In late 2002 - following the sale of the station to [[Chrysalis Radio]] - the station dropped the ITN prefix and returned to its previous name until the rebrand as LBC News 1152. 

During Christmas and New Year 2002/03 an LBC News-branded rolling news service was carried on both 97.3FM and 1152AM prior to the full launches of [[LBC 97.3]] and LBC News 1152.

In Spring 2007 it was announced that the station will be replaced by [[Sky News Radio]].<ref name="Sky News">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.1827|title=LBC News to become Sky News Radio|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=3 April 2007|publisher=Radio Today}}</ref> This move comes alongside [[Channel 4]]'s [[4 Digital Group]] second [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] [[DAB ensemble|multiplex]] bid.

On 18 October 2007, the station's new owners [[Global Radio]] announced that they and Sky had scrapped a joint venture to turn LBC News 1152 into a 24 hour Sky News branded station.<ref>[http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.2576 Radio Today with United Radio..: Sky News Radio complications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In Summer 2008 the 1152 service was substantially cut back. The overnight automated service was abandoned and replaced with a simulcast of [[LBC 97.3]].

The daytime service became semi-automated, with much greater reliance on recorded audio from LBC's FM talk station and Sky News. LBC's five-and-a-half-year relationship with business news provider [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] was also abandoned in favour of business updates from [[CNBC]].

On 15 November 2010, LBC News 1152 was added to the Sky and Virgin Media EPGs, with the station using channel slots formerly occupied by [[Galaxy Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/radio/4302-lbc-news-replaces-galaxy-on-digital-tv|title=LBC News replaces Galaxy on digital TV|publisher=The Airwaves|date=15 November 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724100521/http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/radio/4302-lbc-news-replaces-galaxy-on-digital-tv|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> This came six weeks ahead of Galaxy's rebranding to [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]].
==Listenership==
LBC NEWS 1152 has 373,000 listeners every week, who listen for around 3.4 hours a week. Since 2005, the station has shown consistent moderate growth in terms of people listening, and roughly static total hours.

In terms of competitors, it falls short of sister station LBC 97.3, which achieves 928,000 listeners (who listen for 11.7 hours a week), and BBC London, which achieves 560,000 listeners (who listen for 5.5 hours a week).
