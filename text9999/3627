Muse was acting in New York by the 1920s, during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] with two Harlem theatres, Lincoln Players and Lafayette Players.<ref>Peterson, Bernard L. ''The African American Theatre Directory'', 1816-1960: A Comprehensive Guide to Early Black Theatre, Greenwood Press, 1997 - ISBN 0-313-29537-9</ref> Muse moved to [[Chicago]] for a while, and then moved to [[Hollywood]] and performed in ''[[Hearts in Dixie (film)|Hearts in Dixie]]'' (1929),<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019971/ ''Hearts in Dixie'' (1929)]</ref> the first all-black movie.

While with the Lafayette Players, Muse worked under the management of producer [[Robert Levy (Producer)|Robert Levy]] on productions that helped black actors to gain prominence and respect. In regards to the Lafayette Theatre's staging of ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'', Muse said the play was relevant to black actors and audiences "because, in a way, it was every black man's story. Black men too have been split creatures inhabiting one body.".<ref>Penn, Arthur S</ref> Muse appeared as an opera singer, minstrel show performer, vaudeville and Broadway actor; he also wrote songs, plays, and sketches.

Muse was also the co-writer of several notable songs. In 1931, with [[Leon Ren<U+00E9>]] and [[Otis Ren<U+00E9>]], Muse wrote "[[When It's Sleepy Time Down South]]", also known as "Sleepy Time Down South". The song was sung by [[Nina Mae McKinney]] in the movie ''[[Safe in Hell]]'' (1931), and later became a [[signature song]] of [[Louis Armstrong]].

He was the major star in ''Broken Earth'' (1936),<ref>[http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0135172/ Broken Earth (1936)]</ref> related the story of a black sharecropper whose son miraculously recovers from fever through the father's fervent prayer. Shot on a farm in the South with nonprofessional actors (except for Clarence Muse), the film's early scenes focused in a highly realistic manner on the incredible hardship of black farmers, with plowing scenes. Muse and [[Langston Hughes]] wrote the script for ''[[Way Down South (film)|Way Down South]]'' (1939).<ref>Belton, John. ''Movies and Mass Culture'', Rutgers University Press, 1996 <U+2013> ISBN 0-8135-2228-5</ref> The film was notable for its casting of African-American actors in central roles, and for tackling racial issues in the South. Muse also performed in ''[[Broken Strings (film)|Broken Strings]]'' (1940), as a concert violinist who opposes the desire of his son to play "swing".<ref>Gabbard, Krin. ''Jammin' at the Margins: Jazz and the American Cinema'', University of Chicago Press, p. 109, 1996 <U+2013> ISBN 0-226-27788-7</ref> From 1955 to 1956, Muse was a regular on the weekly TV version of ''Casablanca'', playing Sam the pianist (a part he was under consideration for in the original [[Warner Brothers]] film), and in 1959, he played Peter, the Honey Man, in the film ''[[Porgy and Bess (film)|Porgy and Bess]]'', with [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr]].
