'''Coheed and Cambria''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from Nyack, New York. Formed in 1995, the group incorporates aspects of [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]] and [[post-hardcore]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p525029|pure_url=yes}}|title=Coheed and Cambria Biography|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref><ref name="scaruffi">{{cite web|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/vol7/coheed.html|title=The History of Rock Music.

All of Coheed and Cambria's albums are [[concept album]]s that reveal a science fiction storyline called ''[[The Amory Wars]]'', a story written by lead singer [[Claudio Sanchez]], which has been transcribed into a series of comic books,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theamorywars.com/about-the-amory-wars/|title=The Amory Wars official website.}}</ref> as well as a full length novel. The band has released five studio albums, three live albums, and several special-edition releases. In 2008, the band held a four-day concert series, ''[[Neverender]]'', during which they played their first four studio albums in succession. Their fifth studio album, ''[[Year of the Black Rainbow]]'', which is a prequel to the series, was released on April 13, 2010.

==History==
===Shab<U+00FC>tie (1995<U+2013>2001)===

In March 1995, after the split of [[Claudio Sanchez]] and [[Travis Stever]]'s band called ''Toxic Parents'', they formed a band with [[Nate Kelley]] called ''Beautiful Loser''. The band featured Stever on vocals and guitar, Sanchez on guitar, Kelley on drums and Jon Carleo on bass. The group was short-lived, breaking up by June 1995 after an argument over gas money.<ref name="toxic parents">{{cite web|url=http://dontpassthefence.org/shabutie.html|title=Dontpassthefence.org|work=Shabutie/Coheed and Cambria Knowlegebase|accessdate=January 27, 2008}}</ref> Stever left the band, and the resulting trio was named Shab<U+00FC>tie,<ref name="doa">{{cite web|url=http://www.adequacy.net/interview.php?InterviewID=56|title=Interview With Coheed and Cambria|work=[[Delusions of Adequacy]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080202075046/http://www.adequacy.net/interview.php?InterviewID=56|archivedate=2008-02-02|accessdate=January 27, 2008}}</ref> a word taken from African tribe chants that means "naked prey" in the film ''[[The Naked Prey]]''.

The band spent nearly a year experimenting with a multitude of different musical styles, including [[punk rock]], [[indie rock]], [[acoustic rock]], [[funk]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. When Carleo left the band in August 1996, Kelley recruited [[Michael Todd (musician)|Michael Todd]] to take his place. Todd, who was primarily a guitarist, picked up the bass specifically for Shab<U+00FC>tie.<ref name="doa" /><ref name="saveyourscene">{{cite web|url=http://www.saveyourscene.com/web/view.php?table=interviews&show=4|title=Interview with Claudio|work=SaveYourScene|accessdate=January 27, 2008}}</ref> As Shab<U+00FC>tie, the band wrote dozens of songs and released their first studio demo ''[[Plan to Take Over the World]]'' in 1999. The band also released ''[[The Penelope EP]]'' in 1999, shortly after which Stever rejoined the band.

Kelley left the band during a performance in late 1999, and [[Josh Eppard]], then of the band [[3 (band)|3]], replaced him.<ref name="doa" /><ref name="saveyourscene" /> The band went on to release ''[[Delirium Trigger]]'' in 2000, still featuring Kelley on the drums, but listing Eppard in the liner notes.<ref name="shabutie">{{cite web|url=shabutie.8m.com/custom.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010501174618/shabutie.8m.com/custom.html|title=Home Page|work=Shabutie|accessdate=2008-01-27|archivedate=2001-05-01}}</ref>

Several songs that appeared on ''Delirium Trigger'' were based on a series of [[science fiction]] comics written by Claudio Sanchez called ''The Bag.On.Line Adventures'', which was later renamed ''[[The Amory Wars]]''. Sanchez's side project originally developed during a 1998 trip to Paris, where the band members decided to rename themselves Coheed and Cambria, named after two of the story's protagonists, and adopted the concept story as a theme that would unify their future albums.<ref name="isound">{{cite web | title=Coheed & Cambria : iSOUND.COM | work=iSound | url=http://www.isound.com/coheed_and_cambria  | accessdate=2007-11-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="pollstar">{{cite web | title=Pollstar <U+2013> HotStar Coheed And Cambria | work=[[Pollstar]] | url=http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewhotstar.pl?Artist=COHCAM  | accessdate=2007-11-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> This side project also created Coheed's official logo, the Keywork, a symbol for the planetary alignment of  the [[The Amory Wars|Amory Wars]] universe.<ref name="scifi">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifislacker.com/music/coheed-cambria-interview.shtml|title=Coheed & Cambria @ ScifiSlacker.com|work=ScifiSlacker|accessdate=January 29, 2008}}</ref>

Claudio Sanchez released an album from his side-project [[The Prize Fighter Inferno]] in October 2006 titled ''[[My Brother's Blood Machine]]''. Like Coheed and Cambria's albums, it was a concept album, related to Coheed and Cambria via a character that appears in both stories: Jesse, "The Prize Fighter Inferno". The album was intended to be a prequel to the Coheed and Cambria albums.<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/coheed_cambria/artist.jhtml#bio|title=Coheed and Cambria biography|work=MTV|accessdate=October 18, 2007}}</ref> Claudio says "when we were called Shab<U+00FC>tie, the initial idea for Coheed and Cambria was to be an acoustic/electronic side project.

Sanchez recently stated that with the Coheed and Cambria saga completely chronicled on the group's first five albums, he has been contemplating the direction of future releases. "I've thought of telling stories of the future and stories of the past, maybe getting involved more in the story of Cyrus Amory (sic - Sirius Amory in the stories), the fellow who figured out the value of the Keywork," he said. "Or even stories that kind of parallel the one that we<U+2019>re telling. It<U+2019>s kind of up in the air. I<U+2019>ve started writing music for that next record, and I'm kind of hoping that maybe in doing that it's going to tell me which one to do.<U+201D><ref name="future">{{cite web|url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/01/18/what-the-future-holds-for-coheed-and-cambria/|title=What The Future Holds For Coheed And Cambria|last=Reesman|first=Bryan|date=2011-01-18|work=Attention Deficit Delirium|accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==

Sanchez has several times stated he is envious of his father's era of music, and that the band is influenced by groups of that era, such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Police]], [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Thin Lizzy]].  Apart from these roots in [[classic rock]], Sanchez also acknowledges an eclectic array of influences, including [[post-hardcore]] group [[At the Drive-In]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] pioneers [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name="SSTB" /><ref name="GuitarWorld">{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/this_month|title=di Perna, Alan.
