'''Charles Wade Barkley''' (born February 20, 1963) is a retired American professional [[basketball]] player. Nicknamed "'''Sir Charles'''" for his aggressive and outspoken demeanor, and "'''The Round Mound of Rebound'''" for his unusual build and talent, Barkley established himself as one of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s (NBA's) most dominating [[Power forward (basketball)|power forwards]]. He was selected to the [[All-NBA]] First Team five times, the All-NBA Second Team five times, and once to the All-NBA Third Team.  He earned eleven [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances and was named the [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]] in 1991. In 1993, he was voted the league's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] and during the NBA's 50th anniversary, named one of the [[NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team|50 Greatest Players in NBA History]]. He competed in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic games]] and won two gold medals as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]]' [[United States men's national basketball team#1992 The Dream Team|Dream Team]]. In 2006, Barkley was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].<ref name=nhoh>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/charles-barkley|title=Hall of Famers|publisher=Basketball Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref>

Barkley was popular with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league.<ref name="nbaob">nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/playerfile/charles_barkley/bio.html Charles Barkley: Original Bio], accessed March 6, 2007.</ref> He was frequently involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he mistakenly spat on a young girl, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures should not be considered role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness to become one of the NBA's most dominant [[rebound (basketball)|rebounders]]. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as one of only four players in NBA history with 20,000 [[point (basketball)|points]], 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 [[Assist (basketball)|assists]]<ref name=nbah>nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/history/players/barkley_stats.html Charles Barkley Career Statistics], accessed March 7, 2007</ref>, although a fifth player, Kevin Garnett, has since accomplished that feat.

Since retiring as a player, Barkley has had a successful career as a [[color commentator]] on basketball. He works with [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT) as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games.<ref name="nbabio"/> In addition, Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics; in October 2008, he announced that he will be running for [[Governor of Alabama]] in 2014.<ref name=cnn_gov>cnn.com, [http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/27/brown.barkley/index.html Charles Barkley tells Brown racism is a cancer], accessed October 28, 2008</ref>

==Early life==
Barkley was born and raised in suburban [[Leeds, Alabama]], ten miles (16&nbsp;km) outside of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], and attended [[Leeds High School]]. As a junior, Barkley stood 5'10" (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (99.8&nbsp;kg). He failed to make the [[varsity team]] and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6'4" and earned a starting position on the varsity team in his senior year. He averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds per game and led his team to a 26<U+2013>3 record en route to the state semifinals.<ref name=bbio/> Despite his improvement, Barkley garnered no attention from college scouts until the state high school semifinals, where he scored 26 points against Alabama's most highly recruited player, [[Bobby Lee Hurt]].<ref name=bbio>Charles Barkley. (n.d.). Contemporary Black Biography. Answers.com, [http://www.answers.com/topic/charles-barkley Charles Barkley], accessed May 16, 2007</ref> An assistant to [[Auburn University|Auburn University's]] head coach, [[Sonny Smith]], was at the game and reported seeing, "a fat guy... who can play like the wind".<ref>Michael Wilbon, "Barkley: the Great Wide Hope", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 23, 1984</ref> Barkley was soon recruited by Smith and [[academic major|majored]] in [[business management]] while attending Auburn University.<ref name=bbio/>

==College==
Barkley played [[college basketball|collegiate basketball]] at [[Auburn University]] for three years. Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year.<ref name=nbaob/> He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and [[Block (basketball)|blocked shots]] that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, [[Dribble#Basketball|dribble]] the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname "The Round Mound of Rebound."<ref name=nbabio>nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/history/players/barkley_bio.html Charles Barkley: Historical Biography], accessed March 5, 2007.</ref>

During his college career, Barkley played the [[center (basketball)|center]] position, despite being shorter than the average center. His height, officially listed as {{height|ft=6|in=6}}, is stated as {{height|ft=6|in=4}} in his book, ''[[I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It]]''. He became a member of Auburn's All-Century team and still holds the Auburn record for career field goal percentage with 62.6%.<ref name=tigers/> He received numerous awards, including [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) [[SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second Team [[All-America]]n selection.<ref>auburntigers.cstv.com, [http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/112008aaa.html Auburn All-American Charles Barkley To Be Inducted Into National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame Sunday], accessed May 16, 2009</ref> Later, Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]''.<ref name=tigers>auburntigers.cstv.com, [http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/aub-centennial.html Official Site of Auburn Athletics: Men's Basketball], accessed April 5, 2007.</ref>

In Barkley's three-year college career, he averaged 14.8 points on 68.2% [[field goal percentage|field goal shooting]], 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.7 blocks per game.<ref name=tigers/> In [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1984]], he made his only appearance in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] and finished with 23 points on 80% field goal shooting, 17 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks.<ref>espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?replayId=225 Richmond Spiders vs. Auburn Tigers - Box Score - January 01, 1984], accessed May 17, 2009</ref> Auburn retired Barkley's No. 34 jersey on March 3, 2001.<ref name=tigers/>

==NBA career==
===Philadelphia 76ers===
Barkley left before his final year at Auburn and made himself eligible for the [[1984 NBA Draft]]. He was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], two slots after the [[Chicago Bulls]] drafted [[Michael Jordan]]. He joined a veteran team that included [[Julius Erving]], [[Moses Malone]] and [[Maurice Cheeks]], players who took Philadelphia to the [[1983 NBA Finals|1983 NBA championship]]. Under the tutelage of Malone, Barkley was able to manage his weight and learned to prepare and condition himself properly for a game. He averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned a berth on the All-Rookie Team.<ref name=nbah/> In [[1985 NBA Playoffs|the postseason]], the Sixers advanced to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Finals but were defeated in five games by the [[Boston Celtics]].<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=PHI&yr=1984&lg=n 76ers 1984<U+2013>85 Game Log and Scores], accessed March 11, 2007</ref> As a rookie in the postseason, Barkley averaged 14.9 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.<ref name=nbaob/>

He was named to the [[All-NBA]] Second Team.<ref name=nbaob/>

In the [[1986<U+2013>87 NBA season|1986<U+2013>87 season]], Moses Malone was traded to the [[Washington Bullets]] and Barkley began to assume control as the team leader. He earned his first rebounding title, averaging 14.6 rebounds per game and also led the league in offensive rebounds with 5.7 per game.<ref name=nbah/> He averaged 23.0 points on .594 shooting,<ref name=nbah/> earning his first trip to an [[NBA All-Star game]] and All-NBA Second Team honors for the second straight season. In [[1987 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], Barkley averaged 24.6 points and 12.6 rebounds in a losing effort,<ref name=cbcstats>basketballreference.com, [http://www.basketballreference.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=BARKLCH01 Charles Barkley Career Stats], accessed February 10, 2007</ref> for the second straight year, to the Bucks in a five-game first round playoff series.<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=PHI&yr=1986&lg=n 76ers 1986<U+2013>87 Game Log and Scores], accessed March 11, 2007</ref>

He led the East to a 116<U+2013>114 win over the [[Western Conference (NBA)|West]] with 17 points and 22 rebounds, the most rebounds in an All-Star Game since [[Wilt Chamberlain]] recorded 22 in [[1966<U+2013>67 NBA season|1967]].<ref name=nbaob/> Barkley was presented with Most Valuable Player honors at the All-Star Game and, at the end of the season, named to the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year.<ref name=nbaob/> In [[1991 NBA Playoffs|the postseason]], Philadelphia lost again to Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Barkley contributing 24.9 points and 10.5 rebounds per game.<ref name=cbcstats/>

The [[1991<U+2013>92 NBA season|1991<U+2013>92 season]] was Barkley's final year in Philadelphia. In his last season, he wore number 32 instead of his 34 to honor [[Magic Johnson]],<ref>nytimes.com, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D81730F930A25752C1A967958260 Sports People: Pro Basketball; Barkley Will Switch To Johnson's No. 32], accessed November 18, 2007.</ref> who had announced prior to the start of the season that he was [[HIV]]-positive. Although the 76ers initially retired the number 32 in honor of [[Billy Cunningham]], it was unretired for Barkley to wear. Following Johnson's announcement, Barkley also apologized for having made light of his condition. Responding to concerns that players may contract HIV by contact with Johnson, Barkley stated, "We're just playing basketball. It's not like we're going out to have unprotected sex with Magic."<ref>Chris Weiskopf, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n7_v48/ai_18211328 Return of HIV-positive Magic Johnson -Column], ''[[National Review]]'', April 22, 1996, accessed March 6, 2007</ref>

In his final season with the Sixers, averaging 23.1 points on .552 shooting and 11.1 rebounds per game,<ref name=nbah/> Barkley earned his sixth straight All-Star appearance and was named to the All-NBA Second Team, his seventh straight appearance on either the first or second team.

During Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia, he became a household name and was one of the few NBA players to have a figure published by [[Kenner]]'s [[Starting Lineup]] toy line. He also had his own signature shoe line with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His outspoken and aggressive play, however, also caused a few scandals; notoriously a fight with [[Detroit Pistons]] center [[Bill Laimbeer]] in 1990, an event which drew record fines,<ref>nytimes.com, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DD153CF932A15757C0A966958260 Basketball; Pistons and 76ers Receive $162,500 fine and 3 Bans], accessed March 6, 2007.</ref> and the infamous spitting incident.

===Spitting incident===
In March 1991, during an [[overtime (sport)|overtime]] game in [[New Jersey Nets|New Jersey]], a courtside [[heckler]] had been yelling racial epithets throughout the game at Barkley.<ref name=spitquo>Larry Platt, [http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/30/barkley/index1.html People: Charles Barkley], accessed March 8, 2007.</ref> Upset by the heckler's remarks, Barkley turned to spit at him, but, as he later described, did not "get enough foam", missed and mistakenly spat on a young girl.<ref name=spitquo/> [[Rod Thorn]], the then-[[NBA]]'s president of operations, suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $10,000 for spitting and using abusive language at the fan.<ref>nytimes.com, [http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/sports/pro-basketball-barkley-fined-and-suspended.html Pro Basketball: Barkley Fined and Suspended] accessed March 8, 2007.</ref> It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it.<ref name="spitquo"/> Barkley, however, eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family.<ref name=nbabio/> He apologized and, among other things, provided tickets to future games.<ref name=chuck>nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/barkley_hoopiss5volXXVII.html|title=You're a Good Man Charles Barkley!], accessed March 8, 2007.</ref>

Upon retirement, Barkley was later quoted as stating, "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing<U+2014>the spitting incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning."<ref>sportsillustrated.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/jack_mccallum/news/2002/03/05/nba_insider/ SI's Jack McCallum: Sir Charles speaks], accessed March 8, 2007</ref>

===Phoenix Suns===
The trade to Phoenix in the [[1992<U+2013>93 NBA season|1992<U+2013>93 season]] went well for both Barkley and the Suns.

He became the third player ever to win league MVP honors in the season immediately after being traded, established multiple career highs and led Phoenix to their first [[1993 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance since [[1975<U+2013>76 NBA season|1976]].<ref name=nbaob/> Despite Barkley's proclamation to Jordan, that it was "destiny" for the Suns to win the title, they were defeated in six games by the Bulls.<ref>nytimes.com, [http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/19/sports/pro-basketball-suns-shake-and-roll-bulls-rattle.html PRO BASKETBALL; Suns Shake and Roll; Bulls Rattle], accessed May 25, 2009.</ref> He averaged 26.6 points and 13.6 rebounds per game during the whole postseason,<ref name=cbcstats/> including 27.3 points, 13.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game throughout the championship series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1993_finals.html|title=1993 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}</ref> In the fourth game of the Finals, Barkley recorded a [[triple-double]] after collecting 32 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199306160CHI.html|title=Game 4 Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=May 22, 2008}}</ref>

As a result of severe back pains, Barkley began to speculate his last year in Phoenix during the [[1993<U+2013>94 NBA season|1993<U+2013>94 season]].<ref name=nbaob/> Playing through the worst injury problems of his career, Barkley managed 21.6 points on .495 shooting and 11.2 rebounds per game.<ref name=nbah/> He was selected to his eighth consecutive All-Star Game, but did not play because of a torn right [[quadriceps tendon]],<ref name=nbaob/> and was named to the All-NBA Second Team.

During his career with the Suns, Barkley excelled as a player, earning All-NBA and All-Star honors in each of his four seasons. The always outspoken Barkley, however, continued to stir up controversy during the 1993 season, when he claimed that sports figures should not be role models.<ref>salon.com, [http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/30/barkley/print.html Charles Barkley], accessed March 13, 2007</ref>

===Role model controversy===
Throughout his career, Barkley had been arguing that athletes should not be considered role models.<ref name="nbabio"/> He stated, "A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail; should they be role models?" In 1993, his argument prompted national news when he wrote the text for his "I am not a role model" Nike commercial. [[Dan Quayle]], the former [[Vice President of the United States]], called it a "family-values message" for Barkley's oft-ignored call for parents and teachers to quit looking to him to "raise your kids" and instead be role models themselves.<ref name="rm"/>

Barkley's message sparked a great public debate about the nature of role models. He argued, <blockquote>I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.<ref name="rm"/></blockquote>

===Houston Rockets===
The trade to the [[Houston Rockets]] in the [[1996<U+2013>97 NBA season|1996<U+2013>97 season]] was Barkley's last chance at capturing an NBA championship title. He joined a veteran team that included two of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 Greatest Players]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] and [[Clyde Drexler]]. In his first game with the Houston Rockets, Charles Barkley had a career-high thirty-three rebounds.<ref>Numbelivable!, p.101, Michael X. Ferraro and John Veneziano, Triumph Books, Chicago, Illinois, 2007, ISBN 978-1-57243-990-0</ref> He continued to battle injuries throughout the season and played only 53 games, missing fourteen because of a [[laceration]] and bruise on his left pelvis, eleven because of a sprained right ankle and four due to suspensions.<ref name="nbaob"/> He became the team's second leading scorer, averaging 19.2 points on .484 shooting;<ref name="nbah"/> the first time since his rookie year that he averaged below 20 points per game. With Olajuwon taking most of the shots, Barkley focused primarily on rebounding, averaging 13.5 per game, the second best in his career.<ref name="nbah"/> The Rockets ended the regular season with a 57<U+2013>25 record and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the [[Utah Jazz]].<ref name="nbaob"/> Barkley averaged 17.9 points and 12.0 rebounds per game in [[1997 NBA Playoffs|another postseason]] loss.<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=BARKLCH01 Barkley Stats], accessed March 16, 2007</ref>

The [[1997<U+2013>98 NBA season|1997<U+2013>98 season]] was another injury-plagued year for Barkley. He averaged 15.2 points on .485 shooting and 11.7 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbah"/> The Rockets ended the season with a 41<U+2013>41 record and were eliminated in five games by the Utah Jazz in the first round of [[1998 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].

In his [[1999<U+2013>2000 NBA season|final year]] in the NBA, Barkley's season and career seemingly ended prematurely at the age of 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8, 1999 in Philadelphia, where his career began.<ref>nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/history/players/barkley_bio.html Charles Barkley Bio], accessed May 17, 2007</ref> Before the injury, Barkley averaged 14.5 points on .477 shooting and 10.5 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbah"/> Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career, Barkley returned after four months for one final game. On April 19, 2000, in a home game against the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]], Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and [[Putback#Putback and tip-in|putback]], a common trademark during his career. He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from the injured list, and walked off the court to a standing ovation.<ref name="lg"/> He stated, "I can't explain what tonight meant. I did it for me. I've won and lost a lot of games, but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn't get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own."<ref name="lg">sportsillustrated.cnn.com, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/recaps/2000/04/19/hou_van/ Barkley Retires], accessed April 5, 2007</ref> After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year NBA Hall of Fame career.

Barkley competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic games]] and won two [[gold medal]]s as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States men's basketball team]]. International rules which had previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The result was the legendary [[United States men's national basketball team#1992 Olympics (Barcelona) <U+2013> The Dream Team|Dream Team]], which went 6<U+2013>0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8<U+2013>0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points.<ref name="olymp">usabasketball.com, [http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=moly_1992 USA Basketball: Men's Olympics History (1992)], accessed May 16, 2009</ref> Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single game scoring record with 30 points in a 127<U+2013>83 victory over [[Brazil]].<ref name="olymp"/> He also set a U.S. Men's Olympic record for highest three point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game.<ref name="usarecords">usabasketball.com, [http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=moly_records USA Basketball: USA Men's Olympic Records], accessed May 16, 2009</ref> Barkley was also part of an ugly moment in the 1992 Olympics when he intentionally elbowed Angola player Herlander Coimbra in the chest during a 116<U+2013>48 rout of that team.<ref name="intentionalelbow">{{cite web|first=Harvey|last=Araton|url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D61F3FF934A15754C0A964958260|title=Barcelona: Basketball; Barkley's Elbow Fouls a U.S. Rout|work =The New York Times |publisher =The New York Times Company |date=July 27, 1992|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}</ref>

==Player profile==
Barkley played the [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position but on some occasions he would play the [[small forward]] and [[Center (basketball)|center]] positions. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his strength and agility.<ref name="nbaob"/>

Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game for his season career and 23.0 points-per-game for his playoff career.<ref name="cbcstats"/> He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier [[Clutch (sports)|clutch]] players.<ref name="nbaob"/> During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and [[Fadeaway|fadeaways]], or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total [[field goal percentage]] for his season career and 51.34% total [[field goal percentage|field goal shooting]] for his playoff career (including a career season high of 60% during the [[1989<U+2013>90 NBA season]]).<ref name="cbcstats"/>

Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position<ref name="stealstat">{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/STL_career.html|title=Career Leaders for Steals|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position.<ref name="stealstat"/> Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/BLK_career.html|title=Career Leaders for Blocks|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=April 8, 2007}}</ref> His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a [[chase-down block]].<ref name="hallpro"/>

In a [[SLAM Magazine|SLAM magazine]] issue ranking NBA greats, Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All-Time. In the magazine, NBA Hall-of-Famer [[Bill Walton]] commented on Barkley's ability. Walton stated, "Barkley is like [[Magic Johnson|Magic]] [Johnson] and [[Larry Bird|Larry]] [Bird] in that they don't really play a position. He plays everything; he plays basketball. There is nobody who does what Barkley does. He's a dominant rebounder, a dominant defensive player, a three-point shooter, a dribbler, a playmaker."<ref name="nbabio"/>

==Legacy==
During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was regarded as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play.<ref name="chuck"/> His larger than life persona and confrontational mannerisms often led to [[technical foul]]s and fines and sometimes gave rise to national controversy, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as [[role model]]s and declared, "I am not a role model."<ref name="classic">Bob Carter, [http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Barkley_Charles.html Sir Charles led the NBA in dunks, interviews], accessed April 15, 2007</ref> Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth.<ref name="chuck"/> He stated, "I don't create controversies. They're there long before I open my mouth. I just bring them to your attention."<ref name="nbabio"/>

Barkley was frequently fined for on-court fights with NBA players, such as [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Bill Laimbeer]], and [[Charles Oakley]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Wise|url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E6DD1539F93AA15753C1A960958260|title=Barkley Fight Costs Oakley Two Games and $11,000|work =The New York Times |publisher =The New York Times Company |date=October 29, 1996|accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref> He was also equally confrontational off the court.

As a player, Barkley was a perennial [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] who earned league [[NBA MVP|MVP honors]] in 1993.<ref name="nbabio"/> He employed a physical style of play that earned him the nicknames "Sir Charles" and "The Round Mound of Rebound".<ref>"Charles Barkley". The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University</ref> He was named to the [[All-NBA]] team eleven times and earned two gold medals as a member of the United States Olympic Basketball team. He led both teams in scoring and was instrumental in helping the 1992 "[[United States men's national basketball team#1992 The Dream Team|Dream Team]]" and 1996 Men's Basketball team compile a perfect 16<U+2013>0 record.<ref name="olymp"/><ref name="olympic2"/> He retired as one of only four players in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in their career<ref name="nbabio"/>, although a fifth player, Kevin Garnett, has since accomplished that feat.

In recognition of his collegiate and NBA achievements, Barkley's number 34 jersey was officially retired by Auburn University on March 3, 2001. In the same month, the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] also officially retired Barkley's jersey.<ref name="renumber"/> On 20 March 2004, the Phoenix Suns honored Barkley as well by retiring his jersey and including him in the "[[Phoenix suns#Members of Suns Ring of Honor|Suns Ring of Honor]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/history/00826007.html|title=Phoenix Suns Legends: Ring of Honor|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=July 10, 2007}}</ref> In recognition of his achievements as a player, Barkley was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2006.<ref name=nhoh/>

==Post-basketball life==
===Turner Network Television (TNT)===
Since 2000, Barkley has served as a studio analyst for [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT).<ref name="nbabio"/><ref name="announcer">tnt.tv, [http://www.tnt.tv/title/?oid=623948-3829 Charles Barkley: Announcer], accessed November 11, 2007.</ref> He appears on the network's NBA coverage during pre-game and halftime shows, in addition to special NBA events. He also appears on an original program for the network entitled ''[[Inside the NBA]]'', a post-game show during which Barkley, [[Ernie Johnson, Jr.|Ernie Johnson Jr.]] and [[Kenny Smith]] recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs.<ref name="announcer"/>

During the broadcast of a game, in which Barkley was courtside with [[Marv Albert]], Barkley poked fun at NBA official [[Dick Bavetta]]'s age. Albert replied to Barkley, "I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace." In response to that remark, Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the [[2007 NBA All-Star Weekend]] for $5,000. The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated. The NBA agreed to pitch in an additional $50,000, and TNT threw in $25,000.  The pair raced for three and a half lengths of the basketball court until Barkley ultimately won. After the event, the two embraced in a show of good sportsmanship.<ref name="Bavetta">{{cite web|first=Darren|last=Misener|url=http://www.nba.com/allstar2007/news/bavettabarkley_taletape.html|title=Bavetta vs. Barkley: Sir Charles Reigns|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|date=February 19, 2007|accessdate=March 6, 2007}}</ref>

===Gambling===
Barkley is known for his [[compulsive gambler|compulsive gambling]]. In an interview with [[ESPN]]'s [[Trey Wingo]], Barkley revealed that he lost approximately [[Dollar sign|$]]10 million through [[gambling]].<ref name="gamb"/> In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million, "in a six-hour period", while playing [[blackjack]].<ref name="gamb"/> Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit.<ref name="gamb"/> When approached by fellow [[Turner Sports|TNT]] broadcaster [[Ernie Johnson Jr.|Ernie Johnson]] about the issue, Barkley replied, "It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems. I gamble for too much money. As long as I can continue to do it I don't think it's a problem. Do I think it's a bad habit? Yes, I think it's a bad habit. Am I going to continue to do it? Yes, I'm going to continue to do it."<ref name="gambling">espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2432043 Barkley: Gambling has cost me $10M], accessed July 22, 2007</ref>

Despite suffering big losses, Barkley also claims to have won on several occasions. During a trip to [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], he claims to have won $700,000 from playing [[blackjack]] and betting on the [[Indianapolis Colts]] to defeat the [[Chicago Bears]] in [[Super Bowl XLI]].<ref name="gamb">espn.com [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2755468 Barkley admits huge losses, big gains while gambling (AP report)], accessed March 6, 2007</ref> He went on to state, however, "No matter how much I win it ain't a lot. It's only a lot when I lose. And you always lose. I think it's fun, I think it's exciting. I'm gonna continue to do it but I have to get to a point where I don't try to break the casino 'cause you never can."<ref name="gambling"/>

In May 2008, the [[Wynn Las Vegas]] casino filed a civil complaint against Barkley, alleging that he had failed to pay a $400,000 debt stemming from October 2007.  Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino.<ref name="gambwynn">Ken Ritter, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/topstories/2008-05-15-1363912210_x.htm Barkley says he'll pay huge gambling debt], accessed May 16, 2009</ref> After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, "I've got to stop gambling...I am not going to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I'm not going to gamble... Just because I can afford to lose money doesn't mean I should do it."<ref>usatoday.com, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2008-05-19-barkley_N.htm Barkley: 'I've got to stop gambling' - USATODAY.com], accessed August 9, 2008</ref>

===Politics===
Barkley spoke for many years of his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] affiliation. In 1995, he considered running as a Republican candidate for [[Alabama]]'s governorship in the [[Alabama gubernatorial election, 1998|1998 election]].<ref>msnbc.com, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14051432/ Barkley renews talk of running for Ala. governor] (AP article), accessed January 12, 2007</ref> However, in 2006, he altered his political stance.<ref>rollingstone.com, [http://www.rollingstone.com/nationalaffairs/?p=323 Charles Barkley: "I Was a Republican Until They Lost Their Minds"], accessed May 17, 2009</ref> At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in [[Destin, Florida]], Barkley lent credence to the idea of running for [[Governor of Alabama]], stating: <blockquote>I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration... When I run&nbsp;<U+2014> if I run&nbsp;<U+2014> we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.<ref>Lisovicz, Edan.

In September 2006, Barkley once again reiterated his desire to run for Governor. He noted, "I can't run until 2014&nbsp;... I have to live there for seven years, so I'm looking for a house there as we speak."<ref name="Gov">espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2576203 Barkley serious about running for Alabama governor] (AP article), accessed January 12, 2007</ref> In July 2007, he made a video declaring his support for [[Barack Obama]] in the 2008 Presidential election.<ref>motherjones.com, [http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2007/07/4852_more_charles_ba.html More Charles Barkley Blogging], accessed March 26, 2008</ref> In September 2007, during a broadcast on [[Monday Night Football]], Barkley announced that he bought a house in Alabama to satisfy residency requirements for a 2014 campaign for governor. In addition, Barkley declared himself an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] and not a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] as previously reported. "The Republicans are full of it," Barkley said, "The Democrats are a little less full of it."<ref name="Gov"/>

In February 2008, Barkley announced that he would be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with [[CNN]], stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle,<ref name=cnn_gov/> but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]''.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/25/charles-barkley-on-jay-le_n_371077.html|title=Charles Barkley On "Jay Leno" VIDEO: Trashes Reporters, Talks Sammy Sosa, Politics And More|date=November 25, 2009|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref>

In 2000, Barkley wrote the [[foreword]] for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist [[Rick Reilly]]'s book ''The Life of Reilly.'' In it, Barkley quipped, "Of all the people in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them. It's a shame though, skinny white boys look ''real'' aerodynamic."<ref>thesportstruth.com, [http://www.thesportstruth.com/2006/09/the-weigh-in-charles-barkley-vs-gnarls-barkley.html The Sports Truth], accessed November 11, 2007</ref> In 2002, Barkley released the book ''[[I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It]]'', which included editing and commentary by close friend [[Michael Wilbon]].<ref name="books">usatoday.com, [http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2005-05-02-barkley_x.htm Charles Barkley's 'Black Man' talks about racism], accessed November 11, 2007</ref> Three years later, Barkley released ''Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?,'' which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government.
