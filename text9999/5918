'''NUT midline carcinoma''', abbreviated '''NMC''', is a rare [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[cancer]] that usually arises in the midline of the body and is characterized by a [[mutation]] in the [[NUT gene|nuclear protein in testis (NUT) gene]].<ref>{{OMIM|608963}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The symptoms are similar to other forms of cancer and dependent on the stage.  Symptoms may include [[weight loss]] and [[fatigue]].

NUT midline carcinomas are not specific to any tissue type or organ.<ref name=pmid20951314/>
Common sites include the [[Head|head]], [[neck]] and [[mediastinum]].<ref name=pmid18552174>{{Cite journal  | last1 = French | first1 = CA. | title = Demystified molecular pathology of NUT midline carcinomas. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 492-6 | month = Jun | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2007.052902 | PMID = 18552174 }}</ref> 

==Pathology==
NMC morphologically are poorly differentiated carcinoma with islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium.<ref name=pmid20951314>{{Cite journal  | last1 = French | first1 = CA. | title = NUT midline carcinoma. | journal = Cancer Genet Cytogenet | volume = 203 | issue = 1 | pages = 16-20 | month = Nov | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.06.007 | PMID = 20951314 }}</ref><ref name=pmid18552174>{{Cite journal  | last1 = French | first1 = CA. | title = Demystified molecular pathology of NUT midline carcinomas. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 492-6 | month = Jun | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2007.052902 | PMID = 18552174 }}</ref>

The [[differential diagnosis]] includes [[carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma]] and undifferentiated carcinoma.

The defining feature of NMCs is rearrangement of the ''NUT'' gene.<ref name=pmid20951314/>
Most common is a translocation involving the [[BRD gene]] and [[NUT gene]] (t(15;19)(q14;p13)).<ref name=pmid18552174>{{Cite journal  | last1 = French | first1 = CA. | title = Demystified molecular pathology of NUT midline carcinomas. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 492-6 | month = Jun | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2007.052902 | PMID = 18552174 }}</ref><ref>{{OMIM|608749}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is poor.
