A '''non-metropolitan county''', or '''shire county''', is a [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county-level entity]] in [[England]] that is not a [[metropolitan county]].  The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million.<ref>Jones, B. et al., ''Politics UK'', (2004)</ref> The term ''shire county'' is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear [[Historic counties of England|historic]] names and most end in the suffix "-[[shire]]" such as [[Wiltshire]] or [[Staffordshire]]. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as [[Devon]] and [[Somerset]]. "Shire county" is, strictly, a dual-language [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] since the [[French language|French]]-derived "[[county]]" means the same as the older [[Old English Language|Anglo-Saxon]] word "[[shire]]".

==Origins==
Previous to 1974 local government had been divided between single-tier [[county borough]]s (the largest towns and cities) and two-tier [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] which were subdivided into [[municipal boroughs]] and [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban]] and [[rural districts]]. The [[Local Government Act 1972]], which came into effect on 1 April 1974, divided England outside [[Greater London]] and the six largest conurbations into thirty-nine non-metropolitan counties.  Each county was divided into between two and fourteen [[non-metropolitan district]]s. There was a uniform two-tier system of local government with [[county council]]s dealing with "wide-area" services such as education, fire services and the police, and district councils exercising more local powers over areas such as planning, housing and refuse collection.

{{Non-metropolitan local authority functions}}

As originally constituted, the non-metropolitan counties were largely based on existing counties, although they did include a number of innovations. Some counties were based on areas surrounding large county boroughs or were formed by the mergers of smaller counties. Examples of the first category are Avon (based on Bath and Bristol) and Cleveland (based on [[Teesside]]). Examples of the second category are [[Hereford and Worcester]] and Cumbria. The counties were adopted for all statutory purposes: a [[lord-lieutenant]] and [[high sheriff]] was appointed to each county, and they were also used for judicial administration, and definition of police force areas. The [[Royal Mail]] [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|adopted the counties for postal purposes]] in most areas.

==Changes==
===1995<U+2013>1998===
A [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission]] was appointed in 1992 to review the administrative structure of the non-metropolitan counties. It was anticipated that a system of [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] would entirely replace the two-tier system. The Commission faced competing claims from former county boroughs wishing to regain unitary status and advocates for the restoration of such small counties as Herefordshire and Rutland.<ref>Davis, Howard (1997) 'Reviewing the review', ''Local Government Studies'', 23:3, 5 - 17</ref> The review led to the introduction of unitary local government in some areas but not in others. In the majority of unitary authorities an existing district council took over powers from the county council. The 1972 Act required that all areas outside Greater London form part of a non-metropolitan county, and that all such counties should contain at least one district.<ref>Local Government Act 1972 (c.70), S.1(1)</ref> Accordingly the [[statutory instrument]]s that effected the reorganisation separated the unitary districts from the county in which they were situated and constituted them as counties. The orders also provided that the provisions of the 1972 Act that every county should have a county council should not apply in the new counties, with the district council exercising the powers of the county council. 

An exception was made in the case of [[Berkshire]], which was retained with its existing boundaries in spite of the abolition of its county council and the creation of six unitary authorities. This was done in order to preserve its status as a royal county.<ref>Hansard, ''Written Answers'', March 31, 1995, col.830</ref>

With the creation of numerous new non-metropolitan counties, the areas used for lieutenancy and shrievalty began to diverge from local government areas. This led to the development of [[ceremonial county|ceremonial counties]] for these purposes, a fact recognised by the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]].

===2009===
A further wave of [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|unitary authorities were created in 2009]] under the terms of the [[Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007]].  While a number of new county counties were created, several of the new authorities (such as Cornwall or Northumberland) continued to have the boundaries set in 1974.

==List of non-metropolitan counties==

<U+2020> <small>The name of the non-metropolitan district and district council was changed to "North Somerset" by resolution of the council July 11, 1995. However this did not change the name of the county which had the same area. The Local Government Changes for England (Miscellaneous Provision) Regulations 1995 gave district councils in a "county for which there is no county council and in which there is not more than one district" the additional power to change the name of the county. This was, however, not done until 2005.<ref>[http://www.n-somerset.gov.uk/cairo/docs/doc10520.htm Minutes of the Extraordinary Meeting of the Council, Tuesday 28th June 2005, (North Somerset Council), accessed 2008-05-12]</ref></small>

==Wales==
In Wales there was not a distinction between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, with all upper tier areas designated "counties".<ref>Arnold-Baker, C., ''Local Government Act 1972'', (1973)</ref> The [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]] amended the 1972 Act, abolishing the Welsh counties and creating instead new [[subdivisions of Wales|Welsh principal areas]], some of which are also designated "counties". For the purposes of lieutenancy the counties constituted in 1974 were preserved.
