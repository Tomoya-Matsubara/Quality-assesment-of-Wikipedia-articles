==Playing career==
===Modo Hockey (1997<U+2013>2000)===
Aged 16, Henrik and Daniel Sedin began their professional careers in 1997<U+2013>98 with Modo Hockey of the [[Elitserien|Swedish Elite League]]. Henrik recorded a goal and five points over 39&nbsp;games during his rookie season. In his second year with Modo, he improved to 12 goals and 34 points, joint second in team scoring with [[Samuel P<U+00E5>hlsson]], behind Daniel.<ref name=modo99>{{Citeweb|title=1998<U+2013>99 Modo Hockey Ornskoldsvik [SEL]|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0014321999.html|accessdate=2009-01-20|publisher=Hockeydb}}</ref>  At the end of the season, Henrik and Daniel were named co-recipients of the [[Guldpucken|Golden Puck]], the Swedish player of the year award.<ref name=legends>{{citeweb|title=Henrik Sedin|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=19288|accessdate=2010-04-21|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]}}</ref>

Beginning around the [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09 season]], Henrik began to expand his skill-set by scoring more goals. His increased tendency to shoot was given an extra push when Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career early in the [[2009<U+2013>10 NHL season|2009<U+2013>10 season]], forcing Henrik to play without his brother and consequently pass less often.<ref name=surprise/>  He recorded the first two 20-goal seasons of his career in 2008<U+2013>09 and 2009<U+2013>10, and increased his shot totals.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Henrik Sedin|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8467876|accessdate=2010-04-19|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}</ref>

With his offensive skill the prime component of his game, Henrik is known to avoid initiating contact with opposing players.  Early in their career, he and Daniel were knocked off the puck easily, leading many in the media to refer to them as the "Sedin Sisters".<ref name=surprise/>  As a result, players have often taken advantage of the brothers' lack of physicality by playing aggressively against them. This once led Canucks general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] to publicly complain, commenting during a [[2002 Stanley Cup playoffs|2002 playoff]] series against the [[Detroit Red Wings]], {{"'}}Sedin' is not Swedish for 'punch me or headlock me in a scrum'."<ref>{{citenews|title=Top Canucks prospect Cody Hodgson to return to game action|url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/story.html?id=2510345&add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fscripts%2FSP6Atom.aspx%3Fid%3D830270|accessdate=2010-04-19|date=2010-02-01|publisher=''[[Vancouver Sun]]''|author=Elliott Papp}}</ref>  As their careers progressed, the Sedins have worked on their strength, improving their puck possession and allowing them to play more effectively.<ref name=surprise/>
