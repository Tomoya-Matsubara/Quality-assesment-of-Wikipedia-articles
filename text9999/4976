'''"Cowboy" Jimmy Moore''' (September 14, 1910 <U+2013> November 17, 1999), born '''James William Moore''', was a world-class American [[pocket billiards]] (pool) player originally from [[Troup County, Georgia]], and for most of his life a resident of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], best known for his mastery in the game of [[Straight pool|straight pool (14.1 continuous)]]. 

An excellent athlete at various sports, Moore's many records in billiards include winning the Michigan State Billiard Championship four times, placing second at the World Championship five times competing against the best in the world such as [[Willie Mosconi]], [[Irving Crane]] and [[Luther Lassiter]], winning the United States National Pocket Billiards Championship in 1958, the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship in 1965 and the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition in 1984.

Moore was also known for his straight pool exhibition work, as a formidable {{Cuegloss|Road player|road player}}, and for his unusual pool style, which included both his flamboyant cowboy dress, and his rare form of cueing technique known as a {{Cuegloss|Slip stroke|slip stroke}}. Moore also worked as a technical adviser for billiard-related scenes in television and film in such productions as ''[[My Living Doll]]'', and the Jerry Lewis movie ''[[The Family Jewels (film)|The Family Jewels]]''. He is an inductee of the [[Billiard Congress of America]]'s [[BCA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]], the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
James William Moore was born on September 14, 1910<ref>MyFamily.com Inc. (1998-2007). [http://ssdi.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi U.S. Social Security death index search] (exhibiting birth date).

He was the son of a Georgia blacksmith, sheriff and streetcar conductor. He began working at a young age, supplementing his family's income variously as a cotton picker earning 35 cents per 100&nbsp;pounds, managing a fruit stand, and delivering newspapers. His family moved to Detroit when he was 13, where other ways of making money presented themselves. Moore ran card games and pursued other games of chance, even [[pitching pennies]]. He was very good at such gambling pursuits and was a naturally gifted athlete, attaining a Triple-A level as a baseball player in the minor leagues, once bowled a perfect game, and was a fine golfer.<ref name="McCumber">{{cite journal | last = McCumber | first = David | title = Pool's Last Real Cowboy | journal = Billiards Digest | volume = Vol. 21, No. 8 | pages = p. 60<U+2013>64 | id = [[ISSN]] 0164-761X | date = July 1999}}</ref><ref name="Tribune">Albuquerque Tribune (February 16, 1998).

In 1928 at 18 years of age, Moore took a job as a [[pinsetter]] at Car Barns, a local bowling alley, earning six cents a line. True to form, Moore was a quick study, for a time carrying a 233 bowling average. Moore first picked up a cue stick at Car Barns, playing on the single 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;8&nbsp;foot [[Billiard table|pool table]] the bowling alley had available. According to Moore he immediately fell in love with the game; specifically, with the game of [[straight pool|straight pool (14.1 continuous)]], at which he would chiefly compete during his career, though not to the exclusion of all other billiard disciplines<U+2014>Moore would become national [[snooker]] champion,<ref name="McCumber" /><ref name="Tribune" /><ref name="Journal" /> and would place second at the 1961 First Annual World's One-Pocket Billiards Tournament in [[Johnston City, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite book | author= R.

Straight pool was the game of championship pocket billiards competition until approximately the 1980s when it was overtaken by "faster" games such as [[nine-ball]]. In the game, a shooter may attempt to {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pocket}} any {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}} on the table. The object is to reach a set number of points determined by agreement before the game<U+2014>typically 150 in professional competition. One point is scored for each ball pocketed in the {{Cuegloss|Call shot|pocket called}} and where no {{Cuegloss|Foul|foul}} has transpired.<ref>{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1993 | title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards | publisher = Lyons & Burford | location = [[New York, NY]] | pages = pp. 101-102 |id= ISBN 1-55821-219-1}}</ref> According to Moore, his high run in the game was 236 ball in a row.<ref name="Tribune" /> 

Six months after his first introduction to the game, Moore entered and won the 1929 Michigan State billiard championship. He successfully defended that title in the following three years. During the midst of the [[Great Depression]], however, playing pool for trophies was not a luxury Moore could afford, so he took his game {{Cuegloss|Road player|on the road}}.<ref name="McCumber" /><ref name="Tribune" />

==On the road==
Moore first partnered with [[Hustling|hustler]] ''cum'' [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] player, Ray St. Laurent, a colorful character who staged exhibitions wearing a red cape and mask while billed as "The Red Devil". Although St. Laurent fostered Moore, they were not equals on the pool table. One winter evening in [[Canton, Ohio]], St. Laurent was losing badly in a thoroughly overmatched gambling {{Cuegloss|Session|session}} to Ohio {{Cuegloss|Road player|road legend}}, [[Don Willis]],<ref name="McCumber" /> known as the "Cincinnati Kid", who was considered by many of his colleagues of the time "the deadliest player alive".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gordon and Nancy Hart | title = The Greatest Show on Earth; Two of Johnston City Regulars Remember Action Pool's Years at the Showbar | journal = Billiards Digest | volume = Vol. 21, No. 4 | pages = p. 41 | id = [[ISSN]] 0164-761X | date = March 1999}}</ref> The wager was 25 cents a ball<U+2014>a not inconsiderable sum at the time<U+2014>and Moore was {{Cuegloss|Stake|stakehorsing}} the match. Eventually disgusted by the uneven proceedings, Moore told St. Laurent that he couldn't win and asked him to step aside and let him have a go.<ref name="McCumber" /> Willis later recalled:

{{Quote|Here was this punk kid sitting there saying, 'I'll play you some.' Well, he got out of that overcoat and ran over me in my home poolroom. He never missed a ball.<ref name="McCumber" />|Don Willis, ''Billiards Digest'' (1999)}}

Moore and Willis became traveling partners following their match, often accompanied on the road by future six-time world champion<ref>The New York Times Company October 27, 1988.

At the match ultimately arranged, Moore first beat Ponzi out of $80 playing [[nine-ball]], and then beat him at his own game of choice, straight pool, with Moore scoring 125 points to Ponzi's 82.<ref name="McCumber" />

After Moore's match with Ponzi, he was hired by Ponzi's sometime employer, Sylvester Livingston, a pool impresario who hosted exhibitions with a stable of top pool talent including [[Irving Crane]]<ref name="McCumber" /> who, like Lassiter, would become a six-time world champion.<ref>Billiards Digest (2000).

He lost only one match over the year, and posted straight pool runs of 100 or more in 24 out of the 250 exhibitions.<ref name="McCumber" />

By that time Moore was recognizable by his cowboy airs.<ref name="McCumber" /> He customarily wore [[cowboy boot]]s, a white [[Stetson|Stetson hat]] and a string tie, kept his hair in a crew-cut, and was rarely seen without a cigar.<ref name="Mizerak" /><ref name="Dyer">{{cite book | author= R.

In 1945, Moore's purchased a home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he would live for the rest of his life with his wife, Julie Chavez, whom he married in 1949. They had seven children together: sons Jamie, Raymond and Tommy, and daughters Pamela Nathan, Kolma Moore, Emily DiLorenzo and Linda Bates. Soon after moving to Albuquerque, he became co-owner and operator of  the U Cue Billiards Hall located in the City.<ref name="Tribune" /><ref name="Journal" /> It was said that hustlers avoided going through Albuquerque just to avoid getting into a money game with Moore.<ref name="Sarge" />

==Exhibition and competition==
Though Moore continued playing on the road<U+2014>as he would for over 40 years<U+2014>he began competing and placing in top-tier tournaments. His tournament career was to be overshadowed by an enduring series of runner-up finishes that would earn him the nickname "pool's underpaid prince" in such publications as [[Esquire Magazine]]. The name that stuck with him for life, however, was Cowboy. According to Moore, he became 'Cowboy' Jimmy Moore when he appeared at the Commodore Hotel championships in New York City in the 1950s wearing the required tuxedo, but nevertheless sporting cowboy boots and his signature white Stetson hat.<ref name="McCumber" /><ref name="Tribune" />

The second-place-saga started in 1951 at the two week long, [[Double-elimination tournament|double-elimination]], [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] format, World Championship tournament, held that year in Boston. At the competition, Moore was defeated in his last match by [[Willie Mosconi]]. His record was seven wins in nine matches, including triumphs over future Billiard Congress of America (BCA) Hall-of-Famers, Irving Crane and [[Arthur Cranfield|Arthur "Babe" Cranfield]].<ref name="McCumber" /><ref name="NYT1">The New York Times Company (April 5, 1952).

In 1952 he made a strong showing in the same competition, held once more in Boston, running 93 balls against Lassiter, beating him 150&nbsp;to&nbsp;25, but again finishing behind Willie Mosconi, this time sharing second place with [[Jimmy Caras]] and [[Joe Procita]].<ref>Unlike in a [[Double-elimination tournament|traditional tournament format]], in a round robin competition, multiple players can tie for a particular placement.</ref> Moore's match with Mosconi had an ending score of 150&nbsp;to&nbsp;58 in 19 innings.<ref name="McCumber" /><ref name="NYT1" /> Moore competed in the 1953 World Championship in San Francisco, but did not place, losing in his last match to Crane, 150-56 in 7 innings.<ref>The New York Times Company (March 12, 1953).

The following year Moore took second place yet again in the World Championship, held that year in Philadelphia. The 1954 tournament was not sponsored and was unsanctioned by the BCA; in its absence being organized by [[Irving Crane]]. It was denominated by newspapers, such as ''The New York Times'', as the "Unofficial World Pocket Billiard Championship." In a career highlight in the penultimate match there, Moore was losing 148&nbsp;to&nbsp;8 to [[Irving Crane]]. When Crane let him back to the table, Moore ran 142 balls {{Cuegloss|Out|and out}}.

In all, Moore came in second at the World Championship five times but never took the crown. He did however win the National Pocket Billiards Championship held in Chicago at Bensinger's Billiards in 1958. The tournament was a challenge match, marathon straight pool {{Cuegloss|Race|race}} to 3,000 points between Moore and Luther Lassiter.

Moore would eventually have ten second place finishes in world-title competition. Nevertheless, he frequently competed with and beat all of the players whom he so often played second fiddle to in sanctioned tournament play. In fact, later in 1958, the same year he won the National Pocket Billiards Championship against Lassiter, he roundly defeated Mosconi in a two-day exhibition match in his home town of Albuquerque, with a final score of 500&nbsp;to&nbsp;397.<ref name="McCumber" /> Moore and Mosconi would battle it out many times in unsanctioned but publicized play. In addition to matches previously mentioned, they vied at Albuquerque's old Chaplin Alley on 1956; at the Highland Bowl in 1958; and later, in matches in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], Philadelphia, Chicago and Johnston City at the Jansco Brother's Stardust Open, where Moore would win the prize for "all-around honors".<ref name="Tribune" />

It was not until 1965 at the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship, seven years after his last first place finish, that he would repeat as champion in a sanctioned tournament. At that contest held at the Riviera Terrace in New York City, along the way to first place and the prize of $4,000, Moore defeated: [[Onofrio Lauri]] 150&nbsp;to&nbsp;117; [[Joe Balsis]] 150&nbsp;to&nbsp;-3; [[Cisero Murphy]] 150&nbsp;to&nbsp;96; [[Edwin Kelly|"Champagne" Edwin Kelly]] 150&nbsp;to&nbsp;83 in 3 innings; and the ever-present Luther Lassiter, 150&nbsp;to&nbsp;41 in 4 innings.
