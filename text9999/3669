'''''Fun Home''''' (subtitled ''A Family Tragicomic'') is a [[Graphic novel|graphic]] [[memoir]] by American writer [[Alison Bechdel]], author of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]''. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural [[Pennsylvania]], USA, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of [[sexual orientation]], [[gender role]]s, [[suicide]], [[dysfunctional family]] life, and the role of [[literature]] in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating ''Fun Home'' took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.<ref name="tcj36">{{Cite journal

The memoir focuses on Bechdel's family, and is centered around her relationship with her father, Bruce. Bruce Bechdel was a [[funeral director]] and high school [[English studies|English]] teacher in [[Beech Creek, Pennsylvania|Beech Creek]], where Alison and her siblings grew up. The book's title comes from the family nickname for the [[funeral home]], the family business in which Bruce Bechdel grew up and later worked; the phrase also refers ironically to Bruce Bechdel's tyrannical domestic rule.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bechdel |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Bechdel |title=Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic |year=2006 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |location=New York |isbn=0-618-47794-2 |page=36 }}</ref>  Bruce Bechdel's two occupations are reflected in ''Fun Home'''s focus on death and literature.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite news

In the beginning of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home.<ref name="nyt2" /> His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage.. <ref name="nyt2" /><ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 11, 18, 21, 68<U+2013>69, 71.</ref> This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his [[the closet|closeted]] [[homosexuality|homosexual]] tendencies.<ref name="glrw">{{cite journal

[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] to his [[aestheticism|aesthete]]."<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 15.</ref> This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given [[gender role]]s: "Not only were we [[sexual inversion (sexology)|inverts]], we were inversions of each other.  While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine through me.  It was a war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation."<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 98.</ref> However, shortly before Bruce Bechdel's death, he and his daughter have a conversation in which Bruce confesses some of his sexual history; this is presented as a partial resolution to the conflict between father and daughter.<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 220<U+2013>221.</ref>

At several points in the book, Bechdel questions whether her decision to come out as a lesbian was one of the triggers for her father's suicide.<ref name="pmla" /><ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 57<U+2013>59, 86, 117, 230<U+2013>232.</ref> This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.<ref name="pmla" /><ref name="nyt2" /><ref name="velvetpark" />

===Themes===
''Fun Home'' had several themes recurring throughout the book. The biggest theme, arguably, is sexual orientation. Bechdel tells the readers of her journey of discovering her own sexuality through books. "My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about in a manner consistent with my bookish upbringing." "<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 74</ref>  Her exposure (from reading literal definitions in dictionaries, reading interviews of others like her, etc.) helped her come to terms with her sexuality, but in truth, the hints of it plagued her childhood: her desire "for the right to exchange [her] tank suit for a pair of shorts" in Cannes "<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 73</ref>  or her desire for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip ".<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 113</ref>  However, Bechdel also reveals that she wasn't alone in her choice of partners; her father also exhibited some homosexual behaviors, but in a different way than Alison. "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy" quoted on page 58 when her mother reveals Bechdel's father's secret. Though both, father and daughter, had similar situations (Bechdel was a lesbian while her father was gay or bisexual), the two handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to accept the fact and not hide from the issue, taking a female partner and going to "gay union" meetings. Bechdel was open about her sexuality before she'd even been in a same-sex relationship (of any sort). Her father, on the other hand, had had countless affairs with men but wasn't open about it ".<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 76-81</ref>  This may be due to homophobia (his and/or others'), or because he was married with a family. In any case, it's clear that he's afraid of coming out, as illustrated by "the fear in his eyes" when the conversation topic is dangerously close to homosexuality ".<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 219</ref>  

In addition to sexual orientation, the memoir touches on the theme of gender identity. Bechdel had viewed her father as "a big sissy" "<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 97</ref> while her father tried constantly tried to change his daughter into a more feminine person throughout her childhood. Through the exhibition of various feminine behaviors of Bechdel's father and various masculine behaviors of Bechdel, we see how the two are opposite of each other, opposite of each of their sex's roles, yet the same in their opposition.

The third, underlying theme of death is also portrayed. Though there is debate as to whether Bechdel's father's death was an accident or suicide, she thinks it much more likely that he killed himself ".<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 27-29</ref>  Whether this was because of his own sexuality or Bechdel's (or some other cause) remains unclear.

===Allusions===
The allusive references used in ''Fun Home'' are not merely structural or stylistic: Bechdel writes, "I employ these allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms.  And perhaps my cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the Arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison."<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 67</ref> Bechdel, as the narrator, considers her relationship to her father through the myth of [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]].<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 3<U+2013>4, 231<U+2013>232.</ref> As a child, she confused her family and their [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] home with [[the Addams Family]] seen in the cartoons of [[Charles Addams]].<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 34<U+2013>35.</ref> Bruce Bechdel's suicide is discussed with reference to [[Albert Camus]]' novel ''[[A Happy Death]]'' and essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 27<U+2013>28, 47<U+2013>49.</ref> His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F.

In addition to the literary allusions which are explicitly acknowledged in the text, Bechdel incorporates visual allusions to television programs and other items of [[pop culture]] into her artwork, often as images on a television in the background of a panel.<ref name="glrw" />  These visual references include the film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', [[Bert and Ernie]] of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', the [[Smiley Face]], [[Yogi Bear]],  ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', the [[Wile E.

==Characters==
In Order of appearance:

===Main Characters===

'''Alison Bechdel (''[[Narrator]] and Author''):''' In the book, Alison shows the reader different times in her and her father's life ; she does this starting from her and her father playing when she was just a little girl all the way to her adulthood. During the story, she talks about her strangled relationship with her father and her confusion as to why she believes that he killed himself. In the book, she also shows flashes of her personality, like her case of [[OCD]]. An important scene in the book is when she comes out to her parents. This is an emotional point in her life because she realizes she's doing the exact opposite of what her father had done. <ref> Bechdel, Fun Home, pp. 58</ref>. 

'''Bruce Bechdel:''' Bruce is the father of Alison and her two brothers and was married to his ex-wife Helen. While the book is based on Alison's life, it is emotionally centered on her father. During the book, Alison talks about her relationship with her father and what she believed were the physical causes and the underlying thoughts in her father's head before his death. In the book, it talks about about how he had been having affairs with men ever since he was in the military. He was a closet homosexual and had never openly admitted to it to his family, causing much emotional strife. He was an English teacher, an actor, and a Funeral Director at Beech Creek. Through out the book, it shows how he loved the book '''[[The Great Gatsby]]''' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and admires and strides to be like the main character in the book, Jay Gatsby. This was symbolic because at many points of the memoir Alison would come up with stunningly similar comparisons between the two men's lives. He would be seen doing work on the family's home to bring it back to the state that it once was.  Two weeks after he has his divorce with his ex-wife, he is hit by a truck by the side of the road. Everyone but his daughter thought it was an accident while she thought it was suicide.

'''Helen Bechdel:''' Helen is the ex-wife of Bruce and the mother of Alison. She appears through-out the book, sometimes giving Alison guidance. She is an actor, a writer, and an English teacher. In the book, she was shocked to find out that her daughter was gay and even grow upset over it. In the book her discontent with her uneventful life was shown in her progression through life through Alison's speculations.

===Minor Characters===

'''Joan:''' Joan was Alison's first girlfriend. Alison meets her in college while experimenting with her sexuality. She was Alison's first experience.

''Fun Home'' is drawn in black [[line art]] with a gray-green ink [[Wash (painting)|wash]].<ref name="tcj44-48" /> Sean Wilsey wrote that ''Fun Home'''s [[panel (comics)|panels]] "combine the detail and technical proficiency of [[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]] with a seriousness, emotional complexity and innovation completely its own."<ref name="nyt1" /> Writing in the ''Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide'', Diane Ellen Hamer contrasted "Bechdel's habit of drawing her characters very simply and yet distinctly" with "the attention to detail that she devotes to the background, those TV shows and posters on the wall, not to mention the intricacies of the funeral home as a recurring backdrop."<ref name="glrw" /> Bechdel told an interviewer for ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' that the richness of each panel of ''Fun Home'' was very deliberate:{{quote|It's very important for me that people be able to read the images in the same kind of gradually unfolding way as they're reading the text.  I don't like pictures that don't have information in them.  I want pictures that you have to read, that you have to decode, that take time, that you can get lost in.  Otherwise what's the point?<ref>Emmert, p. 46.  Print edition only.</ref>}}

[[Image:Fun Home photoreference.jpg|right|thumb|Alison Bechdel took photographs of herself posing as each character, to use as reference in her drawing. Here, she poses for a drawing of her father.]]
Bechdel wrote and illustrated ''Fun Home'' over a seven-year period.<ref name="tcj36" /> Her meticulous artistic process made the task of illustration slow. She began each page by creating a framework in [[Adobe Illustrator]], on which she placed the text and drew rough figures.<ref name="tcj44-48" /><ref name="7days" /> She used extensive [[Photo-referencing|photo reference]] and, for many panels, posed for each human figure herself, using a [[digital camera]] to record her poses.<ref name="tcj44-48" /><ref name="7days" /><ref name="ocd"/><ref name="velvetpark" /> Bechdel also used photo reference for background elements. For example, to illustrate a panel depicting fireworks seen from a [[Greenwich Village]] rooftop on July 4, 1976, she used [[Google Images]] to find a photograph of the New York skyline taken from that particular building in that period.<ref name="7days" /><ref name="afterellen">{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Print/2006/5/bechdel.html |title=Alison Bechdel's Life in the Fun Home |accessdate=August 7, 2007 |last=Swartz |first=Shauna |date=May 8, 2006 |work=[[AfterEllen.com]]}}</ref><ref name="tyee">{{cite web |url=http://thetyee.ca/Books/2006/08/23/FunHome/ |title=A Dyke to Watch Out For |accessdate=August 7, 2007 |last=Brooks |first=Carellin |date=August 23, 2006 |work=[[The Tyee]]}}</ref> She also painstakingly copied by hand many family photographs, letters, local maps and excerpts from her own childhood journal, incorporating these images into her narrative.<ref name="afterellen" /> After using the reference material to draw a tight framework for the page, Bechdel copied the line art illustration onto plate finish [[Bristol board]] for the final inked page, which she then scanned into her computer.<ref name="tcj44-48" /><ref name="7days" /> The gray-green ink wash for each page was drawn on a separate page of watercolor paper, and combined with the inked image using [[Photoshop]].<ref name="tcj44-48" /><ref name="7days" /><ref name="velvetpark" /> Bechdel chose the greenish wash color for its flexibility, and because it had "a bleak, elegiac quality" which suited the subject matter.<ref>Emmert, pp. 47<U+2013>48.
