'''''Maverick''''' is a [[Linear motor|linear synchronous motor]]-launched [[Steel roller coaster|steel]] complete-circuit [[roller coaster]] at [[Cedar Point]] in [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], Ohio.  It  was manufactured by IntaRide LLC, the [[United States]] division of [[Intamin]], and was the five-hundredth roller coaster designed by [[Germany|German]] engineer [[Werner Stengel]].  ''Maverick'' is the seventeenth roller coaster built at the park since the ''Blue Streak'' opened in 1964 and ushered in a new era of coaster building.  ''Maverick''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[US$]]21-million price tag makes it Cedar Point's third most expensive roller coaster.  The {{convert|4450|ft|m|adj=on}} course is the fourth longest at Cedar Point.<ref name="News Release">{{Cite web|url=http://maverick.cedarpoint.com/facts/news/|title=News Release|accessdate=2006-09-07|publisher=Cedar Point |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061005031539/http://maverick.cedarpoint.com/facts/news/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-05}}</ref><ref name="Stats and Layout">{{Cite web|url=http://maverick.cedarpoint.com/ride/stats/|title=Stats and Layout|accessdate=2006-09-07|publisher=Cedar Point |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061031203155/http://maverick.cedarpoint.com/ride/stats/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-31}} Note red track and tan supports (the same color choice for ''Iron Dragon'' when in opened in 1987).</ref>  ''Maverick'' was scheduled to open on May 12, 2007, but opening was delayed until May 26, 2007 after testing revealed the [[Roller coaster elements#Heartline roll|heartline roll]] element to be too intense.

In a drop angle of 95 degrees, Maverick has Cedar Point's steepest drop out of any of the coasters in the park. The attraction's tagline is, "The Old West was never this wild."

==History==
[[Image:Maverick footers.jpg|left|thumb|''Maverick''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> footings dot the former Swan Boat pond. Photo taken May 13, 2006]]
According to Cedar Fair officials, discussion about a new roller coaster for the 2007 season started in early 2003, right after the completion of [[Top Thrill Dragster]]. In January 2006, [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Co.]] had filed for a trademark for the name ''Maverick''.  Community speculation reached its high point in the summer of 2006, right before the official announcement.  The project became known officially and colloquially as "Project 2007" until the announcement on September 7, 2006.

===Construction===

After the close of the 2005 season in October, the [[White Water Landing]] log flume ride was retired.  Although the ride was disassembled, the station was left intact and now serves as ''Maverick''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s on-ride photo booth and queue.    Beginning in February 2006, concrete footers were poured on the former ''White Water Landing'' site, as well as in the pond that once housed Cedar Point's ''Swan Boat'' ride.  In May 2006, track segments arrived in a fenced area near the park's off-site hotel, Breakers Express.  Initially, Cedar Point covered track segments with blue tarps.  After several pieces arrived and enthusiasts posted photos on the internet, the park gave up and stopped hiding the track.<ref name="Track Arrival">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointbuzz.com/news.htm?id=900|title=Pieces of Cedar Point's mystery ride revealed|accessdate=2006-09-07|publisher=Sandusky Register|author=Barhite, Brandi|date=2006-05-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060725051633/http://www.pointbuzz.com/news.htm?id=900 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-07-25}}</ref>  Brown supports for ''Maverick'' were delivered to both the staging site at ''Breakers Express'' and the construction site at the park.  Beginning in mid-July 2006, supports were transported across the Cedar Point causeway to the former White Water Landing site for erection.  On August 14, 2006, the first track segments were installed.  On September 11, 2006, the crest of the lift hill was added, thereby topping off the ride.<ref name="On-Point Blog 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/fun/blog/index.cfm?entry=5d7dc114-49ba-4e9c-ba50-e4545a6ed265 |title=Something to See |accessdate=2006-09-13 |author=Adams, Tyler |coauthors=Tony Clark |date= 2006-09-12 |publisher=Cedar Point}}</ref>

On October 20, the last piece of track was installed. Work on the [[Stator]]s began on October 30, the day after the park closed for the 2006 season, and the installation of the stators was presumably finished as of November 14, 2006. During electrical work in late October, one lane of the perimeter road that leads around the tip of the peninsula was closed to run a new electrical service line from the front of the park to ''Maverick''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s plot of land at the back.<ref name="Construction Diary">{{cite web|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/fun/blog/index.cfm?entry=5d7dc114-49ba-4e9c-ba50-e4545a6ed265 |title=Awaiting Power |accessdate=2007-02-26 |author=Gast, Gary |date= 2006-11-20 |publisher=Cedar Point}}</ref>  ''Maverick'' is now connected to the same electrical "trunk" line as ''Top Thrill Dragster'' and ''Wicked Twister''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Delayed opening===
On May 8, 2007, four days before ''Maverick'' was scheduled to debut, park general manager John Hildebrant announced that the ride would be delayed until early June because three {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} track sections after the second launch needed to be replaced.  These sections made up the [[heartline roll]] element and put excessive stress on the trains, which also might have caused discomfort to passengers due to high g-forces

Some observers noted trains rolling backward down the lift hill in a simulated rollback. ''Maverick'' opened on May 26, 2007.

== Rollback ==
On the day that it was going to open to the public, when a Maverick train was about to go down a {{convert|105|ft|m|adj=on}} drop, the train stopped at the top of the hill and slowly went down the hill. This is the second time that the coaster had a rollback. The train on the Maverick track went slowly down the hill to the station and then relaunched again. No one was on that train at that time and the coaster was opened a few days later to the public due to the heartline-roll delay. 

A rollback is fairly common and is done daily to test the ride block system.

==Trains==
''Maverick'' has six three-car trains that seat twelve passengers each.  The trains have tiered seating and feature the following colors: brass, copper, gold, gunmetal, iron, and silver.  Each train has a name on the front car.  The trains are named Brett, Brent, Ben, Beau, Bart, and Sam.  The restraint system, similar to [[Accelerator Coasters]], includes a [[hydraulic]] over the shoulder harness and an interlocking seat belt.<ref name="Stats and Layout"/>  The passenger height restriction was initially set to a minimum of {{convert|48|in|cm}}.  In May 2007, the height restriction was raised to a minimum of {{convert|52|in|cm}} per recommendations made by IntaRide.<ref name="height restriction change">{{cite news  |title=Maverick track replacement begins |url=http://www.sanduskyregister.com/articles/2007/05/22/front/287254.txt |publisher=Sandusky Register |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2007-05-25}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
