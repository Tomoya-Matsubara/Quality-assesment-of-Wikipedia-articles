The '''Independent Labour Group''' was a [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[political party]] in [[Northern Ireland]] from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s.  Sometimes known as the '''Independent Labour Party''', it was formed in 1958 in [[Belfast]] by [[independent Labour]] MP [[Frank Hanna]], with the support of various local [[Roman Catholic]] clerics.  That year, the party wiped out the [[Irish Labour Party]] on [[Belfast City Council]].  

[[John Joseph Brennan]] stood under the party banner in [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 UK general election]], where he received 37.6% of the votes cast, then stood in Belfast Falls in the [[Northern Ireland general election, 1962]].  Hanna continued to hold his [[Belfast Central (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast Central]] seat for the organisation.

In the [[Northern Ireland general election, 1965|1965 Northern Ireland general election]], Brennan took over Hanna's seat, having joined the [[National Democratic Party (Northern Ireland)|National Democratic Party]], for which Brennan was elected; the remainder of the party appears to have joined or disintegrated by this point.
