=== Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature ===
[[File:Signature of Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk.svg|thumbnail|The signature designed by Hagop <U+00C7>er<U+00E7>iyan which [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] ultimately selected.]]
During the initial years of the Turkish Republic and under the [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms|reforms of Atat<U+00FC>rk]], [[Turkish alphabet|a Latin-based alphabet]] was introduced to replace the Perso-Turkic script then in use. As part of the reforms, Turkish citizens were also required to take up a last name under the [[Surname Law (Turkey)|Surname Law]] in 1934. Prior to this, Turkey's Christian and Jewish citizens were already using surnames, but Muslims did not use surnames. Muslims were generally referred by their social or professional titles such as "Pasha", "Hoca", "Bey", "Han<U+0131>m", "Efendi", or their names were complemented with that of their father.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master" /><ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n imzas<U+0131>n<U+0131>n <U+00F6>yk<U+00FC>s<U+00FC>" /> Mustafa Kemal himself was required to take up a surname, and the [[Turkish Parliament]] gave him the surname Atat<U+00FC>rk, meaning father of the Turks.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master" /><ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n imzas<U+0131>n<U+0131>n <U+00F6>yk<U+00FC>s<U+00FC>" /> Many members of parliament, including some of <U+00C7>er<U+00E7>iyan's former students, suggested that Atat<U+00FC>rk needed a new signature for his name. On a November morning in 1934, members of parliament presented the proposal to <U+00C7>er<U+00E7>iyan, who accepted the task.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master" /><ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n imzas<U+0131>n<U+0131>n <U+00F6>yk<U+00FC>s<U+00FC>" /> That night, five model signatures were prepared and the following morning, police officers arrived to collect them.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master" /><ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n imzas<U+0131>n<U+0131>n <U+00F6>yk<U+00FC>s<U+00FC>" /> Atat<U+00FC>rk personally selected the one of "K. Atat<U+00FC>rk" from these five model signatures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ulu|first=Cafer|title=T<U+00FC>rkiye cumhuriyeti'nde Ermeniler|year=2009|publisher=Atat<U+00FC>rk K<U+00FC>lt<U+00FC>r, Dil ve Tarih Y<U+00FC>ksek Kurumu, Atat<U+00FC>rk Ara<U+015F>t<U+0131>rma Merkezi|location=Ankara|isbn=9789751621436|accessdate=14 January 2013|page=122|language=Turkish|quote=<U+00C7>er<U+00E7>iyan'dan bizzat duydu<U+011F>unu ve Ankara`dan istenen 5 adet imza <U+00F6>me<U+011F>indcn birini Atat<U+00FC>rk`<U+00FC>n sc<U+00E7>ti<U+011F>ini s<U+00F6>ylcmi<U+015F>tir.

==Legacy==
According to Hagop <U+00C7>er<U+00E7>iyan's son Dikran <U+00C7>er<U+00E7>iyan, after the death of Atat<U+00FC>rk in 1938, his father's contribution to Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature risked being forgotten: "Some tried to introduce others as the creator of the signature. There were efforts to forget my father. But the truth always come[s] to the surface".<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk's signature came from hand of Armenian-Turkish master" />
