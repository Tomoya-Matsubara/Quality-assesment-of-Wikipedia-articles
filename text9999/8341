'''J<U+00E6>nberht''' (also '''Jambert''', '''Jaenbeorht''',<ref name=ODS268>Farmer ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'' p. 268</ref> '''J<U+00E6>nbert''', '''Jaenberht''', '''Jaenbert''', or '''Jaenberht'''; died 792) was a medieval [[monk]], and later the [[abbot]], of [[Canterbury|St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury]] who was named [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 765. As archbishop, he had a difficult relationship with King [[Offa of Mercia]], who at one point confiscated lands from the archbishopric. By 787, some of the bishoprics under Canterbury's supervision were transferred to the control of the newly-created [[Archbishop of Lichfield|Archbishopric of Lichfield]], although it is not clear if J<U+00E6>nberht ever recognized its legitimacy. Besides the issue with Lichfield, J<U+00E6>nberht also presided over church councils in England. He died in 792 and was considered a saint after his death.

==Early life==
J<U+00E6>nberht was a monk at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury before being selected as abbot of that monastic house.<ref name=DNB>Costambeys "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14581 J<U+00E6>nberht (d. 792)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> He came from a prominent family in the kingdom of Kent, and a kinsman of his, Eadhun, was the [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] of King [[Egbert II of Kent]]. J<U+00E6>nberht himself was on good terms with Egbert.<ref name=Yorke43>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 43</ref>

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
J<U+00E6>nberht was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on 2 February 765,<ref name=Handbook214>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 214</ref> at the court of King Offa of Mercia; this location implies that his election was acceptable to the king.<ref name=Brooks113/> In 766, he received a [[pallium]], the symbol of an archbishop's authority given by the papacy. At this time, Kent had been subjected by Offa; in 776, perhaps at the urging of J<U+00E6>nberht, Kent rebelled and secured its freedom.<ref name=ASE>Keynes "J<U+00E6>nberht" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> In 780 and 781, J<U+00E6>nberht attended church councils at Brentford that were led by King Offa. Although initially on good terms with Offa, J<U+00E6>nberht's ties to Egbert were also strong: after the [[Battle of Otford]], Egbert granted a number of estates to Christ Church. When Offa reasserted control over Kent, which occurred by 785 at the latest, he confiscated these lands and regranted to some of his thegns.<ref name=Brooks113>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 113<U+2013>120</ref>

==Elevation of Lichfield==
During J<U+00E6>nberht's term of office, a dispute arose between the [[see of Canterbury]] and Offa which led in 787 to the creation of the rival [[Bishop of Lichfield|Archdiocese of Lichfield]] under [[Hygberht]].<ref name=Yorke116/> Originally, Offa attempted to bring the southern archbishopric of Canterbury to London, but when the papacy refused permission, Offa secured the creation of a third archbishopric in the British Isles. Lichfield was the main Mercian bishopric, and thus the new archbishopric was under Offa's control.<ref name=Conversion151>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 151</ref> There were several reasons for the conflict between J<U+00E6>nberht and Offa. J<U+00E6>nberht's opposed Offa's deposition of the Kentish dynasty. They conflicted over land which they both claimed as theirs, and J<U+00E6>nberht refused to crown Offa's son [[Ecgfrith of Mercia|Ecgfrith]].<ref name=Yorke116>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' pp. 116<U+2013>117</ref> Problems were also caused by the archbishop minting his own coins at Canterbury.<ref name=Hindley106>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons''  p. 106</ref> [[Matthew Paris]], writing in the thirteenth century, stated that J<U+00E6>nberht conspired to admit [[Charlemagne]] to Canterbury if he invaded Britain. This story may reflect a genuine tradition recorded at [[St Albans Abbey]], where Paris was based, or it may be a fabrication to fill in details of J<U+00E6>nberht's life where Paris had no other information.<ref name=Brooks113/> A rumour during J<U+00E6>nberht's reign also falsely claimed that Offa was plotting with Charlemagne to depose Pope [[Pope Hadrian I|Hadrian I]]; at least one modern historian, [[Simon Keynes]], believes it possible J<U+00E6>nberht was behind the rumour.<ref name=ASE/> Offa's eventual successor later admitted to the papacy that Offa's actions had been motivated by hatred of J<U+00E6>nberht and the Kentish people.<ref name=Whitney89>Witney "Period of Mercian Rule in Kent" ''Arch<U+00E6>ologia Cantiana'' p. 89</ref>

In 787, Pope Hadrian sent a [[pallium]] to Hygberht of Lichfield, elevating Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned. There is no extant contemporary evidence, however, that J<U+00E6>nberht ever recognized Hygberht as an archbishop.<ref name=Brooks113/>{{#tag:ref|The archbishopric at Lichfield was abolished after Offa's death, and was no longer an archdiocese by 803.<ref name=Conversion151/>|group=notes}} Canterbury retained as suffragans the bishops of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield.<ref name=Kirby144>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 144</ref>

==Later life==
J<U+00E6>nberht presided at a council held at London, sometime after the elevation of Lichfield, attended by most of the bishops from southern Britain.<ref name=Kirby143>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 143</ref> J<U+00E6>nberht died on 12 August 792.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Handbook214/> J<U+00E6>nberht was buried in the abbey church of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=ASE/> J<U+00E6>nberht has since been revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 August.<ref name=ODS268/>
