[[Image:DNA Overview.png|thumb|220px|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]
'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ('''DNA''') is a [[nucleic acid]] that contains the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s and some [[virus]]es. The main role of DNA [[molecule]]s is the long-term storage of [[information]]. DNA is often compared to a set of [[blueprint]]s or a recipe, or a [[code]], since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of [[cell (biology)|cells]], such as [[protein]]s and [[RNA]] molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called [[gene]]s, but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.

Chemically, DNA consists of two long [[polymers]] of simple units called [[nucleotide]]s, with backbones made of [[sugar]]s and [[phosphate]] groups joined by [[ester]] bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called [[nucleobase|bases]]. It is the sequence of these four bases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the [[genetic code]], which specifies the sequence of the [[amino acid]]s within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA, in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells, DNA is organized into structures called [[chromosome]]s. These chromosomes are duplicated before cells [[cell division|divide]], in a process called [[DNA replication]]. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]], while in [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) it is found in the cell's [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

(2002) ''Biochemistry.'' W. H. Freeman and Company ISBN 0-7167-4955-6</ref> These two long strands entwine like vines, in the shape of a [[double helix]]. The nucleotide repeats contain both the segment of the backbone of the molecule, which holds the chain together, and a base, which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix. In general, a base linked to a sugar is called a [[nucleoside]] and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a [[nucleotide]]. If multiple nucleotides are linked together, as in DNA, this polymer is called a [[polynucleotide]].<ref name=IUPAC>[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html Abbreviations and Symbols for Nucleic Acids, Polynucleotides and their Constituents] IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN), Accessed 03 Jan 2006</ref>

The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating [[phosphate]] and [[carbohydrate|sugar]] residues.<ref name=Ghosh>{{cite journal |author=Ghosh A, Bansal M |title=A glossary of DNA structures from A to Z |journal=Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr |volume=59 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=620<U+2013>6 |year=2003 |pmid=12657780 |doi=10.1107/S0907444903003251}}</ref> The sugar in DNA is [[deoxyribose|2-deoxyribose]], which is a [[pentose]] (five-[[carbon]]) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric [[covalent bond|bonds]] mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand. This arrangement of DNA strands is called antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are referred to as the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5<U+2032>]] (''five prime'') and [[directionality (molecular biology)|3<U+2032>]] (''three prime'') ends, with the 5' end being that with a terminal phosphate group and the 3' end that with a terminal hydroxyl group. One of the major differences between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with 2-deoxyribose being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.<ref name=berg/>

The DNA double helix is stabilized by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the bases attached to the two strands. The four bases found in DNA are [[adenine]] (abbreviated A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G) and [[thymine]] (T). These four bases are attached to the sugar/phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for [[adenosine monophosphate]].

These bases are classified into two types; adenine and guanine are fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s called [[purine]]s, while cytosine and thymine are six-membered rings called [[pyrimidine]]s.<ref name=berg/> A fifth pyrimidine base, called [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine.

===Grooves===
[[File:DNA orbit animated static thumb.png|frame|right|Structure of a section of DNA. The bases lie horizontally between the two spiraling strands.<ref>Created from [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1D65 PDB 1D65]</ref> Animated version at [[:File:DNA orbit animated.gif]] - over 3 megabytes.]]

Normally, the double helix is a [[right-handed]] spiral. As the DNA strands wind around each other, they leave gaps between each set of phosphate backbones, revealing the sides of the bases inside (see animation). There are two of these grooves twisting around the surface of the double helix: one groove, the major groove, is 22&nbsp;<U+00C5> wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&nbsp;<U+00C5> wide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson R |title=Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5784 |pages=755<U+2013>8 |year=1980 |pmid=7432492 |doi=10.1038/287755a0}}</ref> The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove. As a result, proteins like [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contacts to the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pabo C, Sauer R |title=Protein-DNA recognition |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=53 |pages=293<U+2013>321 |year=1984 |pmid=6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453}}</ref>  This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ''(see below)'', but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

===Base pairing===
{{further|[[Base pair]]}}

Each type of base on one strand forms a bond with just one type of base on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with A bonding only to T, and C bonding only to G. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a base pair. As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high [[temperature]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clausen-Schaumann H, Rief M, Tolksdorf C, Gaub H |title=Mechanical stability of single DNA molecules |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1300792&blobtype=pdf |journal=Biophys J |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=1997<U+2013>2007 |year=2000 |pmid=10733978 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76747-6}}</ref> As a result of this complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. Indeed, this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.<ref name=Alberts/>

The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, left). 
DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content, but contrary to popular belief, this is not due to the extra hydrogen bond of a GC basepair but rather the contribution of stacking interactions (hydrogen bonding merely provides specificity of the pairing, not stability).<ref name ="Yakovchuk2006">Peter Yakovchuk, Ekaterina Protozanova and Maxim D. Frank-Kamenetskii. ''Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix''. Nucleic Acids Research 2006 34(2):564-574; doi:10.1093/nar/gkj454 PMID 16449200</ref>
As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determine the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chalikian T, V<U+00F6>lker J, Plum G, Breslauer K |title=A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=22151&blobtype=pdf |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=96 |issue=14 |pages=7853<U+2013>8 |year=1999 |pmid=10393911 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853}}</ref> In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter]]s, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.<ref>{{cite journal |author=deHaseth P, Helmann J |title=Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=817<U+2013>24 |year=1995 |pmid=7476180 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x}}</ref> In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature required to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T<sub>m</sub>'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J |title=Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern |journal=Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=51 |pages=15996<U+2013>6010 |year=2004 |pmid=15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v}}</ref>

===Sense and antisense===
{{further|[[Sense (molecular biology)]]}}

A DNA sequence is called "sense" if its sequence is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.<ref>[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989, Accessed 07 May 2008</ref> The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=H<U+00FC>ttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N |title=Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? |journal=Trends Genet |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=289<U+2013>97 |year=2005 |pmid=15851066 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007}}</ref> One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Munroe S |title=Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns |journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=664<U+2013>71 |year=2004 |pmid=15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252}}</ref>

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Makalowska I, Lin C, Makalowski W |title=Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes |journal=Comput Biol Chem |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1&ndash;12 |year=2005 |pmid=15680581 |doi=10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006}}</ref> In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In [[bacteria]], this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson Z, Chisholm S |title=Properties of overlapping genes are conserved across microbial genomes |journal=Genome Res |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=2268<U+2013>72 |year=2004 |pmid=15520290 | doi = 10.1101/gr.2433104}}</ref> while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lamb R, Horvath C |title=Diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses |journal=Trends Genet |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=261<U+2013>6 |year=1991 |pmid=1771674}}</ref>

===Supercoiling===
{{Further|[[DNA supercoil]]}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its "relaxed" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benham C, Mielke S |title=DNA mechanics |journal= Annu Rev Biomed Eng |volume=7 |pages=21<U+2013>53 |year=2005 |pmid=16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016}}</ref> If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by [[enzyme]]s called [[topoisomerase]]s.<ref name=Champoux>{{cite journal |author=Champoux J |title=DNA topoisomerases: structure, function, and mechanism |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=70 |pages=369<U+2013>413 |year=2001 |pmid=11395412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.369}}</ref> These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication]].<ref name=Wang>{{cite journal |author=Wang J |title=Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=430<U+2013>40 |year=2002 |pmid=12042765 | doi = 10.1038/nrm831}}</ref>

===Alternative structures===
{{Further|[[Mechanical properties of DNA]]}}

DNA exists in many possible [[Conformational isomerism|conformations]].<ref name=Ghosh/> However, only [[A-DNA]], B-DNA, and [[Z-DNA]] have been observed in organisms. Which conformation DNA adopts depends on the sequence of the DNA, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases and also solution conditions, such as the concentration of [[metal]] [[ion]]s and [[polyamine]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Basu H, Feuerstein B, Zarling D, Shafer R, Marton L |title=Recognition of Z-RNA and Z-DNA determinants by polyamines in solution: experimental and theoretical studies | journal=J Biomol Struct Dyn |volume=6 |issue=2 | pages=299&ndash;309 |year=1988 |pmid=2482766}}</ref> Of these three conformations, the "B" form described above is most common under the conditions found in cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leslie AG, Arnott S, Chandrasekaran R, Ratliff RL |title=Polymorphism of DNA double helices |journal=J.

The A form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove.

===Quadruplex structures===
{{further|[[G-quadruplex]]}}

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s.

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack on top of each other, to form a stable ''[[G-quadruplex]]'' structure.<ref name=Burge>{{cite journal |author=Burge S, Parkinson G, Hazel P, Todd A, Neidle S |title=Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17012276 | journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=34 |issue=19 | pages=5402&ndash;15 |year=2006 |pmid=17012276 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl655}}</ref> These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and [[chelation]] of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parkinson G, Lee M, Neidle S |title=Crystal structure of parallel quadruplexes from human telomeric DNA | journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6891 | pages=876&ndash;80 |year=2002 |pmid=12050675 | doi = 10.1038/nature755}}</ref> Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffith J, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, Stansel R, Bianchi A, Moss H, de Lange T |title=Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop | journal=Cell |volume=97 |issue=4 | pages=503&ndash;14 |year=1999 |pmid=10338214 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6}}</ref> At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands.

===Branched DNA===
{{further|[[Branched DNA]] and [[DNA nanotechnology]]}}
In DNA [[DNA_end#Frayed_ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA.  However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seeman NC |title=DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter |journal=Q.

===Base modifications===
{{further|[[DNA methylation]]}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. For example, cytosine methylation, produces [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]], which is important for [[X-inactivation|X-chromosome inactivation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klose R, Bird A |title=Genomic DNA methylation: the mark and its mediators | journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=31 |issue=2 | pages=89&ndash;97 |year=2006 |pmid=16403636 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2005.12.008}}</ref> The average level of methylation varies between organisms - the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' lacks cytosine methylation, while [[vertebrate]]s have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory | journal=Genes Dev |volume=16 |issue=1 | pages=6&ndash;21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102}}</ref> Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can [[deamination|deaminate]] to leave a thymine base, methylated cytosines are therefore particularly prone to [[mutation]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walsh C, Xu G |title=Cytosine methylation and DNA repair | journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |volume=301 | pages=283&ndash;315 |year=2006|pmid=16570853 |doi=10.1007/3-540-31390-7_11}}</ref> Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria and the [[glycosylation]] of uracil to produce the "J-base" in [[kinetoplastid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ratel D, Ravanat J, Berger F, Wion D |title=N6-methyladenine: the other methylated base of DNA | journal=Bioessays |volume=28 |issue=3 | pages=309&ndash;15 |year=2006 |pmid=16479578 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20342}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gommers-Ampt J, Van Leeuwen F, de Beer A, Vliegenthart J, Dizdaroglu M, Kowalak J, Crain P, Borst P |title=beta-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil: a novel modified base present in the DNA of the parasitic protozoan T. brucei | journal=Cell |volume=75 |issue=6 | pages=1129&ndash;36 |year=1993 |pmid=8261512 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90322-H}}</ref>

DNA can be damaged by many different sorts of [[mutagen]]s, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include [[oxidizing agent]]s, [[Alkylation|alkylating agents]] and also high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[X-ray]]s. The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing [[thymine dimer]]s, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Douki T, Reynaud-Angelin A, Cadet J, Sage E |title=Bipyrimidine photoproducts rather than oxidative lesions are the main type of DNA damage involved in the genotoxic effect of solar UVA radiation | journal=Biochemistry |volume=42 |issue=30 | pages=9221&ndash;6 |year=2003 |pmid=12885257 | doi = 10.1021/bi034593c}},</ref> On the other hand, oxidants such as [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cadet J, Delatour T, Douki T, Gasparutto D, Pouget J, Ravanat J, Sauvaigo S |title=Hydroxyl radicals and DNA base damage | journal=Mutat Res |volume=424 |issue=1&ndash;2 | pages=9&ndash;21 |year=1999 |pmid=10064846}}</ref> A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beckman KB, Ames BN |title=Oxidative decay of DNA |journal=J.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called [[intercalation (chemistry)|''intercalating'']]. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules, and include [[Ethidium bromide]], [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]]. In order for an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators are often [[carcinogen]]s, and [[benzo(a)pyrene|Benzo[''a'']pyrene diol epoxide]], [[acridine]]s, [[aflatoxin]] and [[ethidium bromide]] are well-known examples.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ferguson L, Denny W |title=The genetic toxicology of acridines | journal=Mutat Res |volume=258 |issue=2 | pages=123&ndash;60 |year=1991 |pmid=1881402}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey A |title=DNA modification by chemical carcinogens | journal=Pharmacol Ther |volume=28 |issue=2 | pages=237&ndash;72 |year=1985 |pmid=3936066 |doi=10.1016/0163-7258(85)90013-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stephens T, Bunde C, Fillmore B |title=Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis |journal=Biochem Pharmacol |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=1489&ndash;99 |year=2000 |pmid=10799645 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3}}</ref> Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in [[chemotherapy]] to inhibit rapidly growing [[cancer]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bra<U+00F1>a M, Cacho M, Gradillas A, de Pascual-Teresa B, Ramos A |title=Intercalators as anticancer drugs | journal=Curr Pharm Des |volume=7 |issue=17 | pages=1745&ndash;80 |year=2001 |pmid=11562309 |doi=10.2174/1381612013397113}}</ref>

==Biological functions==
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Venter J, ''et al.'' |title=The sequence of the human genome | journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5507 | pages=1304&ndash;51 |year=2001 |pmid=11181995 |doi=10.1126/science.1058040}}</ref> The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]] which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. Alternatively, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here we focus on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{further|[[Cell nucleus]], [[Chromatin]], [[Chromosome]], [[Gene]], [[Noncoding DNA]]}}
Genomic DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]] of eukaryotes, as well as small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=96 |issue=3 | pages=506&ndash;21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519}}</ref> The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]]. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, as well as [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter]]s and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control the transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding [[exon]]s, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfsberg T, McEntyre J, Schuler G |title=Guide to the draft human genome | journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6822 | pages=824&ndash;6 |year=2001 |pmid=11236998 | doi = 10.1038/35057000}}</ref> The reasons for the presence of so much [[noncoding DNA|non-coding DNA]] in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species represent a long-standing puzzle known as the "[[C-value enigma]]."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gregory T |title=The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/1/133 | journal=Ann Bot (Lond) |volume=95 |issue=1 | pages=133&ndash;46 |year=2005 |pmid=15596463 |doi=10.1093/aob/mci009}}</ref> However, DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, which are involved in the [[regulation of gene expression]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=The ENCODE Project Consortium |title=Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7146 | pages =799<U+2013>816 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05874}}</ref>

===Transcription and translation===
{{further|[[Genetic code]], [[Transcription (genetics)]], [[Protein biosynthesis]]}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (<math>4^3</math> combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA and TAG codons.

[[Image:DNA replication.svg|thumb|450px|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{further|[[DNA replication]]}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but when a cell divides it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing, and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5<U+2032> to 3<U+2032> direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alb<U+00E0> M |title=Replicative DNA polymerases | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=11178285 | journal=Genome Biol |volume=2 |issue=1 | pages=REVIEWS3002 |year=2001 |pmid=11178285 |doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 |nopp=true}}</ref> In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sandman K, Pereira S, Reeve J |title=Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal=Cell Mol Life Sci |volume=54 |issue=12 | pages=1350&ndash;64 |year=1998 |pmid=9893710 |doi=10.1007/s000180050259}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dame RT |title=The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin |journal=Mol.

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins are the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication [[protein A]] is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec J |title=Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=34 |issue=3 | pages=141&ndash;80 |year=1999 |pmid=10473346 |doi=10.1080/10409239991209255}}</ref> These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem-loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Myers L, Kornberg R |title=Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=69 | pages=729&ndash;49 |year=2000 |pmid=10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729}}</ref> Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter; this will change the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spiegelman B, Heinrich R |title=Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal=Cell |volume=119 |issue=2 | pages=157<U+2013>67 |year=2004 |pmid=15479634 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037}}</ref>

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee W, Zhang M, Ren B |title=A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12808131 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=14 | pages=8164&ndash;9 |year=2003 |pmid=12808131 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1332764100}}</ref> Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to "read" the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pabo C, Sauer R |title=Protein-DNA recognition | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=53 | pages=293&ndash;321 |year=1984 |pmid=6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453}}</ref>

===DNA-modifying enzymes===
====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5<U+2032>-GAT|ATC-3<U+2032> and makes a cut at the vertical line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bickle T, Kr<U+00FC>ger D |title=Biology of DNA restriction | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=372918&blobtype=pdf | journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=57 |issue=2 | pages=434&ndash;50 |year=1993 |pmid=8336674}}</ref> In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzyme work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.<ref name=Champoux/> Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schoeffler A, Berger J |title=Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=33 |issue=Pt 6 | pages=1465&ndash;70 |year=2005 |pmid=16246147 |doi=10.1042/BST20051465}}</ref> Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.<ref name=Wang/>

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tuteja N, Tuteja R |title=Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | doi= 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04094.x | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=271 |issue=10 | pages=1849<U+2013>63 |year=2004 |pmid=15128295}}</ref> These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products are copies of existing polynucleotide chains - which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by adding nucleotides onto the 3<U+2032> [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl group]] of the previous nucleotide in a DNA strand. Consequently, all polymerases work in a 5<U+2032> to 3<U+2032> direction.<ref name=Joyce>{{cite journal |author=Joyce C, Steitz T |title=Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=177480&blobtype=pdf | journal=J Bacteriol |volume=177 |issue=22 | pages=6321&ndash;9 |year=1995 |pmid=7592405}}</ref> In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]] makes a copy of a DNA sequence. Accuracy is vital in this process, so many of these polymerases have a [[Proofreading (Biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3<U+2032> to 5<U+2032> [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S |title=Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=71 | pages=133&ndash;63 |year=2002 |pmid=12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041}}</ref> In most organisms DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson A, O'Donnell M |title=Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=74 | pages=283&ndash;315 |year=2005 |pmid=15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859}}</ref>

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.<ref name=Greider/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tarrago-Litvak L, Andr<U+00E9>ola M, Nevinsky G, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S |title=The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/8/8/497 | journal=Faseb J |volume=8 |issue=8 | pages=497<U+2013>503 |year=1994 |pmid=7514143 |month=May |day=01}}</ref> Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure.<ref name=Nugent/>

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martinez E |title=Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal=Plant Mol Biol |volume=50 |issue=6 | pages=925&ndash;47 |year=2002 |pmid=12516863 |doi=10.1023/A:1021258713850}}</ref>

{{further|[[Genetic recombination]]}}
[[Image:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|250px|left|Recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two re-arranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "chromosome territories".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cremer T, Cremer C |title=Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=2 |issue=4 | pages=292<U+2013>301 |year=2001 |pmid=11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075}}</ref> This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is during [[chromosomal crossover]] when they [[genetic recombination|recombine]]. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=P<U+00E1>l C, Papp B, Lercher M |title=An integrated view of protein evolution | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=7 |issue=5 | pages=337&ndash;48 |year=2006 |pmid=16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838}}</ref> Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Driscoll M, Jeggo P |title=The role of double-strand break repair - insights from human genetics | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=7 |issue=1 | pages=45&ndash;54 |year=2006 |pmid=16369571 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1746}}</ref>

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as ''recombinases'', such as [[RAD51]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Visp<U+00E9> S, Defais M |title=Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions |journal=Biochimie |volume=79 |issue=9-10 |pages=587<U+2013>92 |year=1997 |pmid=9466696 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X}}</ref> The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break either caused by an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neale MJ, Keeney S |title=Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7099 |pages=153<U+2013>8 |year=2006 |pmid=16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885}}</ref> A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dickman M, Ingleston S, Sedelnikova S, Rafferty J, Lloyd R, Grasby J, Hornby D |title=The RuvABC resolvasome | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=269 |issue=22 | pages=5492&ndash;501 |year=2002 |pmid=12423347 |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x}}</ref>

==Evolution==
{{Further|[[RNA world hypothesis]]}}
DNA contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year [[Timeline of evolution|history of life]] DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material.<ref name=Joyce>{{cite journal |author=Joyce G |title=The antiquity of RNA-based evolution |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=214&ndash;21 |year=2002 |pmid=12110897 | doi = 10.1038/418214a}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Orgel L |title=Prebiotic chemistry and the origin of the RNA world | url=http://www.crbmb.com/cgi/reprint/39/2/99.pdf |journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=99&ndash;123 |pmid=15217990 | doi = 10.1080/10409230490460765|format=PDF |year=2004}}</ref> RNA may have acted as the central part of early [[cell metabolism]] as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out [[catalysis]] as part of [[ribozyme]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davenport R |title=Ribozymes.

{{further|[[Genetic fingerprinting]]}}

[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or [[hair]] found at a [[crime scene]] to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is called [[genetic fingerprinting]], or more accurately, DNA profiling. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeat]]s and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Collins A, Morton N |title=Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/13/6007.pdf | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=91 |issue=13 | pages=6007&ndash;11 |year=1994 |pmid=8016106 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.13.6007|format=PDF}}</ref> However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weir B, Triggs C, Starling L, Stowell L, Walsh K, Buckleton J |title=Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal=J Forensic Sci |volume=42 |issue=2 | pages=213&ndash;22 |year=1997 |pmid=9068179}}</ref> DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jeffreys A, Wilson V, Thein S |title=Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA | journal=Nature |volume=316 |issue=6023 | pages=76&ndash;9 |year=1985|pmid=2989708 |doi=10.1038/316076a0}}</ref> and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Colin Pitchfork|Enderby murders]] case.<ref>[http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork <U+2014> first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 Dec 2006</ref>

People convicted of certain types of crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for a database. This has helped investigators solve old cases where only a DNA sample was obtained from the scene. DNA profiling can also be used to identify victims of mass casualty incidents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |month=September | year=2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}</ref> On the other hand, many convicted people have been released from prison on the basis of DNA techniques, which were not available when a crime had originally been committed.

{{further|[[DNA nanotechnology]]}}
DNA nanotechnology uses the unique [[molecular recognition]] properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based as well as using the "[[DNA origami]]" method) as well as three-dimensional structures in the shapes of [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]]. [[DNA machine|Nanomechanical devices]] and [[DNA computing|algorithmic self-assembly]] have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as [[Colloidal gold|gold nanoparticles]] and [[streptavidin]] proteins.

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the [[central dogma of molecular biology|"Central Dogma" of molecular biology]], which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the "adaptor hypothesis".<ref>Crick, F.H.C.

Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] to decipher the genetic code.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1968/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1968] Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 Dec 06</ref> These findings represent the birth of [[molecular biology]].
