'''State Highway 34''' (abbreviated '''SH-34''') is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oklahoma]]. It runs for {{convert|188.3|mi|km|1}} south-to-north in the western part of the state. The highway begins northeast of [[Eldorado, Oklahoma|Eldorado]], in the southwest corner of the state, and extends north to the Kansas state line between [[Woodward, Oklahoma|Woodward]] and [[Coldwater, Kansas]]. 

SH-34 has always been a lengthy highway, starting with its commissioning in June 1931, when it was a border-to-border highway stretching from Texas to Kansas. Most of SH-34 has followed the same basic corridor since its inception, with the exception of the portion of highway north of Woodward. The southernmost portion of highway, connecting it to Texas, became solely [[Oklahoma State Highway 6|SH-6]] in 1987.

There are three letter-suffixed spur highways branching from SH-34. SH-34A and SH-34B serve small towns in Greer County off the mainline of SH-34, while SH-34C serves [[Boiling Springs State Park]].

==Route description==
For much of its extent, State Highway 34 passes through rural areas, running through the plains of western Oklahoma. The highway begins at SH-6 six miles (10&nbsp;km) northeast of [[Eldorado, Oklahoma|Eldorado]].<ref name="odot-2009-10-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Map|edition=2009<U+2013>10|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/2009state/pdfs/state-map.pdf|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref> Heading north from there, it intersects [[U.S. Route 62 in Oklahoma|U.S. Route 62]] (US-62) just east of [[Duke, Oklahoma|Duke]]. The highway continues north into [[Greer County, Oklahoma|Greer County]] to its county seat of [[Mangum, Oklahoma|Mangum]], where SH-34 joins [[U.S. Highway 283 (Oklahoma)|US-283]]. Two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of Mangum, [[State Highway 9 (Oklahoma)|SH-9]] joins for a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with SH-34 and US-283. Thereafter, SH-9 splits off to the east.<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/> 

Nine miles (14&nbsp;km) north of Mangum, SH-34B branches off to the west, connecting to the town of [[Brinkman, Oklahoma|Brinkman]], and four miles (6&nbsp;km) later, SH-34A branches off to the west to the town of [[Willow, Oklahoma|Willow]].<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/> US-283 splits off to the northwest two miles (3&nbsp;km) after that, and SH-34 continues north, crossing into [[Beckham County, Oklahoma|Beckham County]]. SH-34 then bridges over the [[North Fork of the Red River]]. In [[Carter, Oklahoma|Carter]], the highway serves as the western terminus of [[State Highway 55 (Oklahoma)|SH-55]]. Five miles (8&nbsp;km) north of Carter, SH-34 crosses [[State Highway 152 (Oklahoma)|SH-152]].<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/> 

SH-34 continues on to an interchange with [[Interstate 40 (Oklahoma)|Interstate 40]] (I-40) west of [[Elk City, Oklahoma|Elk City]]. Here, the highway begins a concurrency with eastbound I-40. SH-34 accesses I-40 from exit 32, a partial [[diamond interchange]], with no access to or from I-40 eastbound; the missing movements must be completed via another partial interchange further to the east, also numbered as exit 32, which serves [[Interstate 40 Business (Elk City, Oklahoma)|Business I-40]] (I-40 BUS). SH-34 follows I-40 to the east for {{convert|6|mi|km}}.<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/> While concurrent with I-40, SH-34 has an interchange with SH-6, its northernmost junction with the latter highway. SH-34 exits the interstate from the left at exit 41 on the east side of Elk City, turning back to the north and intersecting I-40 BUS. The highway continues north out of Elk City, exiting Beckham County.<ref name="ggm"/>

After leaving Beckham County, SH-34 enters [[Roger Mills County, Oklahoma|Roger Mills County]]. [[State Highway 73 (Oklahoma)|SH-73]]'s western terminus is at SH-34 at nine miles (14&nbsp;km) north of Elk City.<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/> North of this junction, SH-34 lies along the Roger Mills<U+2013>[[Custer County, Oklahoma|Custer]] county line, which it continues to follow as it passes through the east side of [[Hammon, Oklahoma|Hammon]], where it meets [[State Highway 33 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 33]]. North of town, the route crosses over the [[Washita River]], and shortly thereafter turns northeast to fully enter Custer County. Northwest of [[Moorewood, Oklahoma|Moorewood]], the highway crosses into [[Dewey County, Oklahoma|Dewey County]].<ref name="delorme">{{cite map|publisher=DeLorme|title=Oklahoma Atlas and Gazetteer|scale=1:200,000|year=2006}}</ref>

In Dewey County, SH-34 crosses [[State Highway 47 (Oklahoma)|SH-47]], two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of [[Leedey, Oklahoma|Leedey]], and crosses the [[Canadian River]] near the unincorporated settlement of [[Trail, Oklahoma|Trail]]. The highway then passes through [[Camargo, Oklahoma|Camargo]]. Just east of [[Vici, Oklahoma|Vici]], SH-34 joins [[U.S. Highway 60 (Oklahoma)|US-60]] and [[State Highway 51 (Oklahoma)|SH-51]] for a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) concurrency, then SH-34 heads north again at Vici.<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/> The highway passes through [[Sharon, Oklahoma|Sharon]] north of Vici, then joins [[U.S. Highway 183 (Oklahoma)|US-183]]/[[U.S. Highway 270 (Oklahoma)|US-270]]/[[State Highway 3 (Oklahoma)|SH-3]] four miles (6&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Woodward, Oklahoma|Woodward]]. At Woodward, SH-34 again sets off to the north alone, and right after crossing the [[North Canadian River]], SH-34C branches to the east about two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of Woodward, connecting to Boiling Springs State Park.<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/>

SH-34 joins [[U.S. Highway 64 (Oklahoma)|US-64]] in far eastern [[Harper County, Oklahoma|Harper County]] for a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) concurrency to the east, crossing the [[Cimarron River (Arkansas River)|Cimarron River]] {{convert|17|mi|km|0}} east of [[Buffalo, Oklahoma|Buffalo]]. The highway then turns back to the north, where it is {{convert|10|mi|km|-1}} to its terminus at the Kansas state line.<ref name="odot-2009-10-map"/>

==History==
State Highway 34 was first designated on June 15, 1931.<ref name="odot-history">{{odot history|type=SH|route=34|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref> At that time, the highway began at the free bridge over the [[Red River (south)|Red River]] north of [[Quanah, Texas]], and followed what is today SH-6 to the point that is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment did not differ significantly from that of the present day (although it followed [[US-66 (OK)|US-66]] through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until it got to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 of that day instead turned west, then north, passing through [[Fort Supply, Oklahoma|Fort Supply]] and crossing into [[Harper County, Oklahoma|Harper County]] just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, bringing it to the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway.<ref name="odot-1931-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma State Highway Department|title=Map Showing Condition of Improvement of the State Highway System|edition=December 1, 1931|url=http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1931gov.pdf|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref>

SH-34 was rerouted north of Buffalo on January 30, 1934.<ref name="odot-history"/> The new alignment continued due north out of Buffalo to the Kansas state line along a new road. The old portion of SH-34 between US-64 and the Kansas state line became part of [[SH-50 (OK)|SH-50]].<ref name="odot-1935-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Highways|title=Map Showing Condition of Improvement of the State Highway System and Landing Fields|edition=October 1935|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1935.pdf|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref>

The next major change to SH-34 occurred in 1954. On November 1 of that year, the highway was realigned to follow a new road extending north of Woodward, intersecting US-64 east of Buffalo, and following existing highways north to the state line.<ref name="odot-history"/> This would put SH-34 on its present-day route north of Woodward.<ref name="odot-1955-map">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Highways|title=Oklahoma's Highways 1955|url=http://www.odot.org/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/state-maps/pdfs/1955.pdf|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref> SH-50 would remain concurrent with SH-34 north of US-64 until November 9, 1964.<ref name="odot-history-50">{{odot history|type=SH|route=50|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref>

The next major change to SH-34 would be brought about by the establishment of the southern part of State Highway 6. The new highway was introduced on July 7, 1975.<ref name="odot-history-6">{{odot history|type=SH|route=6|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref> SH-34 remained in place; the two highways were concurrent from northwest of Eldorado to the Red River bridge, where they both ended. On January 5, 1987, the redundant section of SH-34 was removed, truncating it to its current southern terminus.<ref name="odot-history"/><ref name="odot-history-6"/> 

The final modification to SH-34 occurred just under a month later, on February 2, 1987, when SH-34 was realigned in Elk City to follow I-40 instead of the old alignment of the now-dead US-66, which had become a business loop of I-40. No further changes have taken place since then.<ref name="odot-history"/>
