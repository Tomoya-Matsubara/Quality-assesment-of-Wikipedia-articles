The '''shads''' or '''river herrings''' make up the [[genus]] '''''Alosa''''', [[fish]] related to [[herring]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Clupeidae]].  They are distinct from others in that family by having a deeper body and spawning in rivers. Several species can be found on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]]. ''Alosa'' can also be found throughout the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name=Coad/> Many are found in freshwater during spawning and some are only found in landlocked freshwater.

==Appearance==
''Alosa'' species are generally dark on the back and top of the head, with blue, violet, or greenish tints.<ref name=Coad/> However, some can be identified as having a grey or green back.<ref name=Coad/> Spots are commonly found behind the head, and the fins may vary from species to species or individually.<ref name=Coad/> Most species of ''Alosa'' weigh {{convert|300|g|oz}} or less, with one species, ''Alosa pontica'', weighing up to 2 kilograms.<ref name=Coad/>

==Biology==
Shads are thought to be unique among the fishes in having evolved an ability to detect [[ultrasound]] (sound at frequencies above 20&nbsp;kHz, which is the limit of human hearing).<ref name="Mann">Mann, D. A.; Higgs, D. M.; Tavolga, W. N.; Souza, M. J.; and Popper, A. N. (2001). Ultrasound detection by clupeiform fishes. ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'' 109:3048<U+2013>3054 </ref>  This was first discovered by fisheries biologists studying a type of shad known as [[blueback herring]], and was later verified in laboratory studies of hearing in American shad. This ability is thought to help them avoid [[dolphins]] that find prey using echolocation. ''Alosa'' are generally [[pelagic]].<ref name="Greek">Bobori, D. C., E. T. Koutrakis, and P. S. Economidis. ''Shad Species In Greek Waters <U+2013> An Historical Overview And Present Status.'' Bulletin Fran<U+00E7>ais De La P<U+00EA>che Et De La Pisciculture 362-363 (2001): 1101-108.</ref> They are mostly [[Anadromous#Classification|anadromous]] or semianadromous with the exception of strictly freshwater landlocked species.<ref name=Greek/> ''Alosa'' species are generally migratory and schooling fish.<ref name=Greek/> Males will usually mature about a year before females; they spawn in the late spring to summer months.<ref name="travis">Travis, R., Age, ''growth and fecundity of Alabama shad (Alosa alabamae) in the Apalachicola River, Florida'' Clemson University, 2007. 2007. 1442095.</ref><ref name="Bianco">Bianco, P. G. (2002), The Status of the Twaite Shad, Alosa agone, in Italy and the Western Balkans. Marine Ecology, 23: pp. 51<U+2013>64. {{doi|10.1111/j.1439-0485.2002.tb00007.x}}</ref> Most individuals die shortly after spawning.<ref name=travis/><ref name=Bianco/> ''Alosa'' species are seemingly very adaptive vertebrates and can change readily to adapt to their environments, as species are found in a variety of temperatures and waters.<ref name="twaite">Bianco, Pier Giorgio. ''The Status of the Twaite Shad, Alosa Agone, in Italy and the Western Balkans.'' Marine Ecology 23.S1 (2002): 51-64.</ref>

==Life cycle and reproduction==
As ''Alosa'' species are generally anadromous, they are faced with various obstacles to survival.<ref name="Lochet">Lochet, A., S. Boutry, and E. Rochard. ''Estuarine Phase during Seaward Migration for Allis Shad Alosa Alosa and Twaite Shad Alosa Fallax Future Spawners.'' Ecology of Freshwater Fish 18 (2009): 323-35.</ref> They may have to pass through numerous barriers and waters to get to either their spawning grounds or normal habitats (the sea in most cases).<ref name=Lochet/> Estuaries are a major factor in numerous ''Alosa'' species migration.<ref name=Lochet/> Estuaries can be highly variable and complex environments contributing to fluctuating biological interactions,<ref name=Lochet/> with shifts in osomolarity, food sources, predators, etc.<ref name=Lochet/> Since many adult ''Alosa'' species die after spawning, the young generally have to migrate to the sea from the spawning grounds.<ref name=Lochet/> Duration of migration varies among fish, but it can greatly affect survival.<ref name=Lochet/>

Reproduction varies by species.<ref name="Coad">Coad, Brian. "THE SHAD FOUNDATION<U+2019>S SHAD JOURNAL-''Shad in Iranian Waters''." SHAD Journal ISSN 1099-4990 2.4 (Fall 1997): 4-7.</ref>Studies done on ''Alosa'' in Iranian waters have shown that spawning varies in time, place, and temperature of the waters they inhabit.<ref name=Coad/>Fecundity may also vary.<ref name=Coad/>Species are known to spawn as early as April or as late as August.<ref name=Coad/> Temperatures range from about 11 to 27<U+00B0>C.<ref name=Coad/> Fecundity can range from 20,000 eggs to 312,000 eggs.<ref name=Coad/> Eggs are pelagic.<ref name=Coad/>

The life span of ''Alosa'' species can be up to 10 years, but this is generally uncommon, as many die after spawning.<ref name=Coad/>

== Systematics ==
[[File:Shad roe.jpg|thumb|right|roe]]
Systematics of shads is complex. The genus inhabits a wide range of [[habitat]]s, and many [[taxa]] are [[Fish migration|migratory]]. A few forms are land-locked, including one from [[Killarney]] in [[Ireland]] and two from lakes in northern Italy.  Some species are native to the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]], as well as the [[Persian Gulf]]. ''Alosa'' species of the Caspian are systemically characterized by the number of rakers on the first gill arch by some scientists.<ref name="Malkin">Malkin, E. M., and S. B. Andrianova. ''Biology and Traits of the Formation of Stock of Big-eyed Shad Alosa Saposchnikowii.'' Journal of Ichthyology 48.6 (2008): 443-51.</ref> They are classified as being "multirakered," "medium-rakered," or "oligorakered."<ref name=Malkin/> The multirakered are primarily plankton feeders, the oligorakered have large rakers and are predators, and the medium-rakered generally possess a mixed diet.<ref name=Malkin/> Most current species of the ''Alosa'' genus in North America can be found in Florida, although Florida may not be the only place where these species are found.<ref name=McBride>Richard S. McBride (2000). ''Florida<U+2019>s Shad and River Herrings 
(Alosaspecies): A Review of Population 
and Fishery Characteristics'' FLORIDA MARINE RESEARCH INSTITUTE TECHNICAL REPORTS: TECHNICAL REPORT TR-5, Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission. St. Petersburg, Florida.</ref> 

[[morphology (biology)|Morphology]] is notoriously liable to [[adaptation (biology)|adapt]] to changing food availability in these fish. Several taxa seem to have [[evolution|evolve]]d quite recently, making molecular analyses difficult. In addition, it appears as if [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] is a factor to be reckoned with when researching shad [[phylogeny]].<ref name="Faria">Faria, R.; Weiss, S.; & Alexandrino, P. (2006): ''A molecular phylogenetic perspective on the evolutionary history of ''Alosa'' spp. (Clupeidae).'' ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''40'''(1): 298<U+2013>304. <small>{{doi|10.1016/j.ympev.2006.02.008}}</small> (HTML abstract).</ref>
* ''The Founding Fish'' (2002) ISBN 0-374-10444-1.

Nonetheless, some trends are emerging. The North American species except the Atlantic shad can probably be separated in a [[subgenus]] (or even genus) ''Pomolobus''. On the other hand, the proposed genus (or subgenus) ''Caspialosa'' for the [[Caspian Sea]] forms is rejected due to [[paraphyly]].<ref name=Faria/>

==Management==
Shad populations have been in decline for years due to spawning areas blocked by dams, habitat destruction, pollution, and overfishing. Management of shad has called for more conservative regulations, as well as policies to help the species obtain a lower fishing mortality.<ref name="asmfc-shad">

==Political significance==
Shad serve a peculiar symbolic role in [[Virginia]] state politics. On the year of every gubernatorial election, would-be candidates, lobbyists, campaign workers, and reporters gather in the town of [[Wakefield, Virginia]] for [[Shad Planking|shad planking]]. American shad served as the focal point of [[John McPhee]]'s book ''The Founding Fish''.<ref>"American Shad - Fish Reference Library - RedOrbit."
