The '''Glarner Sprinter''' was a [[List of named passenger trains|named passenger train]] of the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB). It ran from [[Zurich]] into the [[canton of Glarus]], and was operated as a [[RegioExpress]] service. The train provided a commuter service for passengers travelling from the towns and villages of Glarus to the greater Zurich region, whilst also providing a tourist connection (for winter sports, hiking, mountain climbing, etc.) in the opposite direction. In July 2014 it was replaced by a more frequent service as part of the [[Z<U+00FC>rich S-Bahn]], the [[S25 (ZVV)|S25]].<ref name=sbbgs>{{cite web | url = http://www.sbb.ch/en/corporation/sbb-as-business-partner/federal-government-cantons/regional-traffic/eastern-switzerland/glarnersprinter.html | title = GlarnerSprinter | publisher = Swiss Federal Railways | accessdate = 2013-05-21}}</ref><ref name=fpf720>{{cite web | url = http://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2013/720.pdf | title = Z<U+00FC>rich<U+2013>Thalwil<U+2013>Ziegelbr<U+00FC>cke | publisher = Bundesamt f<U+00FC>r Verkehr | accessdate = 2013-05-21}}</ref><ref name=fpf736>{{cite web | url = http://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2013/736.pdf | title = Ziegelbr<U+00FC>cke<U+2013>Linthal | publisher = Bundesamt f<U+00FC>r Verkehr | accessdate = 2013-05-21}}</ref><ref name=tre-224-28-32>{{cite news | title = Z<U+00FC>rich's New S-Bahn Tunnel | work = Today's Railways Europe | date = August 2014 | publisher = Platform 5 Publishing Ltd | pages = 28<U+2013>32 | first = David | last = Haydock | issue = 224}}</ref>

== History ==
Since 1918, there was no longer a direct connection from the Canton of Glarus to Zurich. The "Glarner Dream" of a direct connection to Z<U+00FC>rich was realized by the Pendlerverein (commuter association) of the Glarus government and the SBB as a component of the Swiss [[Bahn 2000]] modernization plan and put into service on 12 April 2004. The plan was for an hourly service, but this could not be achieved due to financial problems in the canton Glarus and technical problems on the part of the SBB.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The Glarner Sprinter ceased operation in July 2014. It was replaced by a more frequent hourly service as part of the [[Z<U+00FC>rich S-Bahn]], designated as the [[S25 (ZVV)|S25]].<ref name=tre-224-28-32/>

== Route and schedule ==
After leaving Zurich, the Glarner Sprinter ran along the west side of [[Lake Z<U+00FC>rich]], stopping only at [[Pf<U+00E4>ffikon SZ|Pf<U+00E4>ffikon]] and [[Ziegelbr<U+00FC>cke]]. From Ziegelbr<U+00FC>cke it followed the valley of the [[Linth River]], stopping at all intermediate stations including those for [[Glarus Town]] and [[Schwanden, Glarus|Schwanden]]. On weekends and public holidays, the train then ran without stopping to [[Linthal, Glarus|Linthal]]; on other days it terminated at Schwanden.<ref name=fpf720/><ref name=fpf736/>

The train served the following stations:<ref name=fpf720/><ref name=fpf736/>

* '''[[Z<U+00FC>rich Hauptbahnhof|Z<U+00FC>rich HB]]'''
* [[Pf<U+00E4>ffikon SZ railway station|Pf<U+00E4>ffikon SZ]]
* [[Lachen railway station|Lachen]]
* [[Siebnen-Wangen railway station|Siebnen-Wangen]]
* [[Ziegelbr<U+00FC>cke railway station|Ziegelbr<U+00FC>cke]]
* [[Nieder- und Oberurnen railway station|Nieder- und Oberurnen]]
* [[N<U+00E4>fels-Mollis railway station|N<U+00E4>fels-Mollis]]
* [[Netstal railway station|Netstal]]
* [[Glarus railway station|Glarus]]
* [[Ennenda railway station|Ennenda]] (not weekends and public holidays)
* [[Mitl<U+00F6>di railway station|Mitl<U+00F6>di]] (not weekends and public holidays)
* '''[[Schwanden railway station|Schwanden]]''' 
* [[Linthal Braunwaldbahn railway station|Linthal Braunwaldbahn]] (weekends and public holidays only)
* '''[[Linthal railway station|Linthal]]''' (weekends and public holidays only)

On working days, the train ran every two hours. On weekends and on public holidays, the train made two return trips each day. The trip from Z<U+00FC>rich to Schwanden took from 1 hour and 5 minutes to 1 hour and 7 minutes; to Linthal, from 1 hour and 19 minutes to 1 hour and 33 minutes.<ref name=fpf720/><ref name=fpf736/>

== Motive power ==
The usual [[Locomotive|motive power]] on this route was two modernized [[SBB-CFF-FFS RBDe 560|RBDe 560 <U+00AB>NPZ Domino<U+00BB>]] dedicated to this route with special Glarner Sprinter livery (RBDe 560 DO GLS 201 and 202). Four Inova coaches (two second class, two first and second class) as well as a  first class ''At'' [[Control car (rail)|control car]] made up the rest of the consist.<ref name="sbbgs"/>

Prior to the current units, a pair of unmoderminised units (RBDe 560 120 "Netstal" and 560 123 "Braunwald") were used, again in a special livery. Occasionally, Glarner Sprinter services are carried out with [[SBB-CFF-FFS RABe 514|RABe 514]] electrical multiple units or [[SBB-CFF-FFS Re 450|Re 450]] powered push-pull trains. In the past, a consist made up of two [[SBB-CFF-FFS RBe 540|RBe 540]] on either end of a set of Einheitswagen I/II cars were sometimes used as replacement.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
