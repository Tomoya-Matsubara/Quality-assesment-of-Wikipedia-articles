'''Benjamin Harrison''' (August 20, 1833 &ndash; March 13, 1901) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|twenty-third]] [[President of the United States]], serving one term from 1889 to 1893. Harrison was born in [[North Bend, Ohio]], and at age 21 moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], where he became a prominent state politician. During the [[American Civil War]] Harrison served as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] in the [[XXI Corps (ACW)|XXI Corps]] of the [[Army of the Cumberland]]. After the war he unsuccessfully ran for the governorship of [[Indiana]], but was later elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] from that state.

Harrison, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], was elected to the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]], defeating the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent, [[Grover Cleveland]]. He was the first and only president from the state of Indiana. His presidential administration is best known for its economic legislation, including the [[McKinley Tariff]] and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], and for annual federal spending that reached one billion dollars for the first time. Democrats attacked the "Billion Dollar Congress", and used the issue, along with the growing unpopularity of the high tariff, to defeat the Republicans, both in the [[United States House election, 1890|1890 mid-term elections]] and in Harrison's bid for reelection in [[United States presidential election, 1892|1892]].

After failing to win reelection he returned to private life at his home in Indianapolis where he remarried, wrote a book, and later represented the [[Republic of Venezuela]] in an international case against the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1900 he traveled to Europe as part of the case and, after a brief stay, returned to Indianapolis where he died the following year, from complications arising from [[influenza]].

==Early life==
===Family and education===
The [[Harrison family|Harrisons]] were among the [[First Families of Virginia]], with their presence in the New World dating back to the arrival of an Englishman, named Benjamin Harrison, at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1630. The future president Benjamin was born on August 20, 1833, in [[North Bend, Ohio|North Bend]], [[Hamilton County, Ohio]], as the second of eight children of [[John Scott Harrison]] (later a U.S. [[Congressman]] from [[Ohio]]) and Elizabeth Ramsey Irwin. Benjamin was a grandson of President [[William Henry Harrison]] and great-grandson of revolutionary leader and former Virginia governor [[Benjamin Harrison V]].<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 7&ndash;8; [[#moore|Moore]], p. 15</ref>  Harrison was seven years old when his grandfather was elected President, but he did not attend the inauguration.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 8</ref>  Although Harrison's family was old and distinguished, he did not grow up in a wealthy household, as most of John Scott Harrison's farm income was expended on his children's education.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 9; [[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, pp. 21&ndash;23</ref>  Despite the meager income, Harrison's boyhood was enjoyable, with much of it spent outdoors fishing or hunting.<ref>[[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, pp. 22&ndash;23</ref>

Harrison's early schooling took place in a one-room schoolhouse near his home, but he was later provided with a tutor to help him with college preparatory studies.<ref>[[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, pp. 24&ndash;29</ref>  Harrison and his brother, Irwin, enrolled in Farmer's College near [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1847.<ref>[[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, pp. 29&ndash;30</ref>  Harrison attended the college for two years.<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], p. 53.  The school was later known as Belmont College.  After Belmont closed, the campus was transferred to the [[Ohio Military Institute]], which closed in 1958.</ref> In 1850, he transferred to [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]], where he was a member of the fraternity [[Phi Delta Theta]] and graduated in 1852.<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], pp. 21&ndash;23; [[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, p. 58</ref> Harrison attended Miami University with [[John Alexander Anderson]],<ref name = c23>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 23</ref> who would become a six term congressman, and [[Whitelaw Reid]], who would be Harrison's vice presidential candidate in his reelection campaign. While attending Miami University, was greatly influenced by one his professors, [[Robert Hamilton Bishop]], who instructed him in history and political economy.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 10&ndash;11; [[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, pp. 31&ndash;34</ref>  At Miami, Harrison joined a [[Presbyterian]] church and, like his mother, he would remain a member for the rest his life.<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], p. 58</ref> After completing college Harrison took up the study of law in the Cincinnati law office of Storer & Gwynne, but before completing his law studies he returned to Oxford to marry.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 11&ndash;12, p. 23</ref>

While at Farmer's College, Harrison met [[Caroline Lavinia Scott]], the daughter of the University's president, John W. Scott, a Presbyterian minister.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 10</ref>  On October 20, 1853, they married in Oxford, Ohio, with Caroline's father performing the ceremony.   <ref name = c23/> The Harrisons had two children, Russell Benjamin Harrison (August 12, 1854 &ndash; December 13, 1936) and Mary "Mamie" Scott Harrison McKee (April 3, 1858 &ndash; October 28, 1930).<ref name = c2729>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 27 & 29</ref>

===Early legal career===
After his marriage in 1853, Harrison returned to live on his father's farm where he finished his law studies. In the same year, he inherited $800 after the death of an aunt, using the money to move to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] in 1854.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 26</ref> He was admitted to the bar there and began practicing law in the office of John H. Ray. The same year he became a [[Town crier|crier]] for the Federal Court in Indianapolis, making $2.50 per day. He was responsible for passing through the streets and declaring announcements from the court.<ref name = c2729/>

While in Indianapolis, Benjamin Harrison was both the first President of the University Club, a private [[gentlemen's club]], and the first President of the Phi Delta Theta Alumni Club of Indianapolis, the fraternity's first such club. Both clubs were still in existence in 2008.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 22</ref> Harrison grew up in a [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] household and was himself a supporter of Whig politics in his early life. He joined the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shortly after its formation in 1856 and that year campaigned on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]].<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 18</ref> He won election to become Indianapolis City Attorney in the same election, a position that paid an annual salary of $400.<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], p. 29</ref>

In 1858 Harrison entered into a law partnership, opening an office as Wallace & Harrison.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 28; [[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, p. 105</ref> Harrison was the Republican candidate for the position of [[Court reporter|reporter]] of the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] in 1860, his first foray into politics. Although this office was not political, he was an active supporter of his party's platform. During the election he debated [[Thomas Hendricks]], the Democratic candidate for governor and future [[Vice President of the United States]], on behalf of the Republican Party.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 59</ref> After his law partner William Wallace was elected county clerk in 1860, Harrison opened a new firm with William Fishback, named Fishback & Harrison, where he worked until his entry into the army.<ref>[[#sievers|Sievers]], v. 1, p. 171</ref>

===Civil War===
[[Image:GenBenHarrison.jpg|thumb|right|Brig. Gen. Benjamin Harrison]]
At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Harrison wished to join the [[Union Army]], but initially resisted, as he was concerned that his young family would need his financial support.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 20</ref> In 1862, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued a call for more recruits. While visiting Governor [[Oliver Morton]], Harrison found him distressed over the shortage of men answering the latest call. Harrison told the governor, "If I can be of any service, I will go".<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], p. 180; [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 34</ref> Morton then asked Harrison if he could help to recruit a regiment, though he would not ask him to serve. Harrison proceeded to raise a regiment, recruiting throughout northern Indiana. Morton offered its command to Harrison, but he declined because of his lack of military experience, and instead was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]]. In August 1862, when the regiment left Indiana to join the Union Army at [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Harrison was promoted by Morton to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]], and his regiment was commissioned as the [[List of Indiana Civil War regiments|70th Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry]].<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], pp. 180&ndash;181; [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 21&ndash;23, p. 41, p. 44</ref>

The 70th Indiana first saw action in the [[Battle of Perryville]], but spent most of the next two years performing reconnaissance duty and guarding railroads in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]]. In 1864, Harrison and his regiment joined [[William T. Sherman]]'s [[Atlanta Campaign]] and moved to the front lines. On January 2, 1864, Harrison was promoted to command the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the [[XXI Corps (ACW)|XXI Army Corps]]. He commanded the [[brigade]] at the Battles of [[Battle of Resaca|Resaca]], [[Cassville, Georgia|Cassville]], [[Battle of New Hope Church|New Hope Church]], Lost Mountain, [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]], [[Battle of Marietta|Marietta]], [[Battle of Peachtree Creek|Peachtree Creek]] and [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]]. Harrison was later transferred to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] and participated in the [[Battle of Nashville]].<ref name = c3644>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 36&ndash;44; [[#wallace|Wallace]], pp. 209&ndash;225</ref> On March 22, 1865, Harrison earned his final promotion, to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]], and marched in the [[Grand Review of the Armies|Grand Review]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] before mustering out of the army on June 8, 1865.<ref name = c3644/>

==Post-war career==
===Indiana politics===
While serving in the army in October 1864, Harrison was reelected [[Law report|reporter]] of the [[Supreme Court of Indiana]] and served four more years.<ref name=c19>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p.19</ref> The position was not politically powerful, but did afford Harrison a steady income.<ref name=c19/> Harrison's public profile was raised when President [[Ulysses Simpson Grant|Grant]] appointed him to represent the federal government in a civil claim brought by [[Lambdin P. Milligan]], whose wartime conviction for [[treason]] had been reversed by the Supreme Court. Due to Harrison's advocacy, the damages awarded against the government were minimal.<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], pp. 93&ndash;94, p. 119</ref> Local Republicans urged Harrison to run for Congress, but he initially confined his political activities to speaking on behalf of other Republican candidates, a task for which he received high praises from his colleagues.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp.27&ndash;28; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 8</ref>

[[Image:Benjamin Harrison Home.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Harrison Home]] in Indianapolis]]
In 1872, Harrison entered the race for the Republican nomination for [[governor of Indiana]]. He was unable to get the support of former Governor [[Oliver Morton]], who favored his opponent, [[Thomas M. Browne]], and ultimately Harrison lost his bid for statewide office.<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], p. 28</ref> Harrison returned to his law practice where, despite the [[Panic of 1873]], he was financially successful enough to build a grand new home in [[Indianapolis]] in 1874.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 29</ref> He continued to make speeches on behalf of Republican candidates and policies.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 30</ref>

In 1876 Harrison did not initially seek his party's nomination for governor, but when the original nominee dropped out of the race, Harrison accepted the Republicans' invitation to take his place on the ticket.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 32; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 8</ref> His campaign was based strongly on economic policy, and he was in favor of deflating the national currency. His policies proved popular with his base, but he was ultimately defeated by a plurality to [[James D. Williams]], losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast.<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], p. 266; [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 32 & 58</ref> Harrison remained a prominent Republican in Indiana following his defeat, and when the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]] reached Indianapolis, he helped to mediate between the workers and management and to preserve public order.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 33&ndash;34</ref>

When Senator Morton died in 1878, the Republicans nominated Harrison to run for the seat, but the party failed to gain a majority in the state legislature, and the Democratic majority elected [[Daniel W. Voorhees]] instead.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 35&ndash;36. Before the passage of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Senators were elected by state legislatures.</ref> President [[Rutherford B. Hayes|Hayes]] appointed Harrison to the [[Mississippi River Commission]] in 1879, which was founded to facilitate internal improvements on that river.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 8</ref> He was a delegate at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]] the following year.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 36</ref>

===United States Senator===
[[Image:Walter Q. Gresham - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Q. Gresham]], Harrison's rival within the Indiana Republican Party]]
After Harrison led the Republican delegation to the National Convention, he was again mentioned as a possible Senate candidate.<ref name=c37>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 37</ref> He gave speeches in favor of Garfield in Indiana and New York, further raising his profile in the party. When the Republicans retook the [[Indiana General Assembly|state legislature]], Harrison's election to the Senate was threatened by his intra-party rival Judge [[Walter Q. Gresham]], but the contest was decided in favor of Harrison.<ref name=c37/> After President [[James Garfield]]'s victory in 1880, Harrison was offered a cabinet position, but he declined in order to begin his term as senator.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 60; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 8</ref>

Harrison served in the Senate from March 4, 1881, to March 4, 1887. He was chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard|U.S. Senate Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard]] ([[Forty-seventh United States Congress|47th Congress]]) and [[United States Senate Committee on Territories|U.S. Senate Committee on Territories]] ([[Forty-eighth United States Congress|48th]] and [[Forty-ninth United States Congress|49th Congress]]es).<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], pp. 265&ndash;267; [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 59</ref> The major issue confronting Senator Harrison in 1881 was the budget surplus. Democrats wished to reduce the [[tariff]], thus limiting the amount of money the government took in; Republicans instead wished to spend the money on internal improvements and pensions for Civil War veterans. Harrison took his party's side and advocated for generous [[pension]]s for veterans and their widows.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 39</ref> Harrison also supported, unsuccessfully, aid for education of Southerners, especially the children of the slaves freed in the Civil War, believing that education was necessary to make the white and black populations truly equal in political and economic power.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 39&ndash;40</ref> Harrison differed from his party in opposing the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]], believing that it violated existing treaties with [[China]].<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 40</ref>

In 1884, Harrison and Gresham again opposed each other, this time for influence at the [[1884 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=c41>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 41&ndash;42</ref> The delegation ended up supporting [[James G. Blaine]], the eventual nominee.<ref name=c41/> In the Senate, Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill only to see it vetoed by President [[Grover Cleveland]].<ref name=c42>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p.42</ref> His efforts to further the admission of new western states were stymied by Democrats, who feared that the new states would elect Republicans to Congress.<ref name=c42/>

In 1885, the Democrats [[redistricting|redistricted]] the Indiana state legislature, which resulted in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide.<ref name=c43>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 43&ndash;44</ref> Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection, the result being determined against him after a deadlock in the [[Indiana Senate|state senate]], with the legislature eventually choosing Democrat [[David Turpie]].<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], p. 66</ref> Harrison returned to Indianapolis and his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 45&ndash;46</ref>

{{fixHTML|end}}
The initial favorite for the Republican nomination was the previous nominee, [[James G. Blaine]] of [[Maine]]. After Blaine wrote several letters denying any interest in the nomination, his supporters divided among other candidates, with [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] of [[Ohio]] as the leader among them.<ref name=c47>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 47</ref> Others, including [[Chauncey Depew]] of [[New York]], [[Russell Alger]] of [[Michigan]], and Harrison's old nemesis Walter Q. Gresham, now [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|a federal appellate court judge in Chicago]], also sought the delegates' support at the [[1888 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=c47/> Blaine did not choose any of the candidates as a successor, so none entered the convention with a majority of the Blaine supporters.

Harrison placed fourth on the first ballot, with Sherman in the lead, and the next few ballots showed little change.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 50</ref> The Blaine supporters shifted their support around among the candidates they found acceptable, and when they shifted to Harrison, they found a candidate who could attract the votes of many delegates.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 51&ndash;52</ref> He was nominated on the eighth ballot by 544 to 108 votes, winning the Republican presidential nomination.<ref>[[#wallace|Wallace]], p. 271</ref> [[Levi P. Morton]] of New York was chosen as his running mate.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 9</ref>

===Election over Cleveland===
Harrison's opponent in the general election was incumbent President [[Grover Cleveland]]. He ran a front-porch campaign, typical of the era, in which the candidate does not campaign but only receives delegations and makes pronouncements from his home town.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 11</ref> The Republicans campaigned heavily on the issue of [[tariff|protective tariffs]], turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North. The election focused on the swing states of [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], and Harrison's home state of Indiana.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 10</ref> Harrison and Cleveland split these four states, with Harrison winning by means of [[Blocks of Five|notoriously fraudulent balloting]] in New York and Indiana.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 43; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 13</ref> Voter turnout was 79.3% because of a large interest in the campaign issue, and nearly eleven million votes were cast.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 57</ref> Although Harrison received 90,000 fewer popular votes than Cleveland, he carried the [[Electoral College]] 233 to 168.<ref>{{National Archives EV source|year=1888| as of=November 5, 2008}}</ref>

Although he had made no political bargains, his supporters had given many pledges upon his behalf. When Boss [[Matthew Quay]] of [[Pennsylvania]], who rebuffed for a Cabinet position for his political support during the convention, heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to [[Divine Providence|Providence]], Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know "how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him President."<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 55, 60</ref> Harrison was known as the Centennial President because his inauguration celebrated the [[George Washington's legacy#Centennial celebration|centenary of the first inauguration]] of [[George Washington]] in 1789.<ref name = c4754> [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 47-54</ref>

==Presidency 1889&ndash;1893==
===Civil service reform and pensions===
[[Image:Harrison Football Political Cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Political football]]]]
[[Civil service]] reform was a prominent issue following Harrison's election. Harrison had campaigned as a supporter of the [[merit system]], as opposed to the [[spoils system]].<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 32</ref> Although some of the civil service had been classified under the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act|Pendleton Act]] by previous administrations, Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp.32&ndash;36</ref> Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side. The issue became a [[political football]] of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned "What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?"<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], pp. 83, 86</ref> Harrison appointed [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Hugh Smith Thompson]], both reformers, to the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]], but otherwise did little to further the reform cause.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 39&ndash;41</ref>

Harrison quickly saw the enactment of the [[Dependent and Disability Pension Act]] in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress.<ref name=ss36>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp.36&ndash;37; [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 72&ndash;73</ref> In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability,) the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus.<ref name=ss36/> Pension expenditures reached $135 million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner [[James R. Tanner]]'s expansive interpretation of the pension laws.<ref name=ss36/>

===Tariff===
[[Image:Billion dollar Congress.jpg|thumb|Harrison and the [[51st United States Congress|Billion-Dollar Congress]] are portrayed as wasting the surplus in this cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]''.]]
The issue of [[tariff]] levels had been a major point of contention in American politics since before the Civil War, and tariffs became the most prominent issue of the 1888 election.<ref name=s51>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 51</ref> The high tariff rates had created a surplus of money in the Treasury, which many led many Democrats (as well as the growing Populist movement) to call for lowering the rates.<ref name=s49>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 49</ref> Most Republicans wished the rates to remain high, and to spend the surplus on [[Public works|internal improvements]] as well as the elimination of some internal taxes.<ref name=s49/>

Representative [[William McKinley]] and Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] framed the [[McKinley Tariff]] that would raise the tariff even higher, including making some rates intentionally prohibitive.<ref name = c1004>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 100&ndash;104; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 51&ndash;52</ref> At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports.<ref name=s51/> The tariff was removed from imported raw [[sugar]], and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production.<ref name = c1004/> Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to the reputation of the [[51st United States Congress|Billion-Dollar Congress]].<ref name=s51/>

===Antitrust laws===
[[Image:John-Sherman-2.jpg|thumb|left|Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] worked closely with Harrison, writing bills regulating [[Sherman Antitrust Act|monopolies]] and [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act|monetary policy]].]]
Members of both parties were concerned with the growth of the power of [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]] and [[Monopoly|monopolies]], and one of the first acts of the [[51st United States Congress|51st Congress]] was to pass the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], sponsored by Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] of Ohio.<ref name=s53>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 53</ref> The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law.<ref name=s53/> The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 92&ndash;93</ref> While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, there is no evidence he ever sought to enforce it very vigorously.<ref name=s54>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 54; [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p.94</ref> The government successfully concluded only one case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company),<ref>The case was [[United States v. Jellico Mountain Coal]], 46 Fed., 432. June 4, 1891</ref> although it did pursue cases against several other trusts.<ref name=s54/>

===Silver===
One of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by [[Bimetallism|gold and silver]], or by [[gold standard|gold alone]].<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 94&ndash;95</ref> The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard.<ref name=silver>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 94&ndash;95; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 55&ndash;59</ref> Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.<ref name=silver/> Owing to worldwide [[deflation]] in the late nineteenth century, however, a strict gold standard had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts, pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure.<ref name=silver/>

The silver coinage issue had not been much discussed in the 1888 campaign, so Harrison's exact position on the issue was initially unclear, but his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, [[William Windom]], encouraged the free silver supporters.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 56&ndash;57</ref> Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold.<ref name=sherman>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 58; [[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 96</ref> This served only to disappoint both factions. In July 1890, Senator Sherman achieved passage of a compromise bill, the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], in both houses.<ref name=sherman/> Harrison thought that the bill would end the controversy, and he signed it into law.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 59</ref> The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply, a problem that would persist until the second [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]] administration [[Grover Cleveland#Economic panic and the silver issue|resolved it]].<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 60</ref>

===Technology===
In Harrison's time in office, the United States was continuing to experience advances in science and technology.  Harrison was the earliest President whose voice is known to be preserved. That {{Audio|Benjamin Harrison speech.ogg| thirty-six-second recording}} was originally made on a wax [[phonograph cylinder]] in 1889 by Giuseppe Bettini.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.msu.edu/vincent/presidents/harrison.htm|title=President Benjamin Harrison|publisher=Vincent Voice Library|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Harrison also had electricity installed in the White House for the first time by [[General Electric|Edison General Electric Company]], but he and his wife would not touch the light switches for fear of [[electric shock|electrocution]] and would often go to sleep with the lights on.<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], p. 96</ref> 

===Foreign policy===
The [[First International Conference of American States]] met in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1889, establishing an information center that later became the [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]].<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], p. 108</ref> The conference failed to achieve any diplomatic breakthrough, but that failure led the Secretary of State [[James G. Blaine|Blaine]] to focus on tariff reciprocity with Latin American nations, which was more successful.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 118</ref> Harrison sent [[Frederick Douglass]] as ambassador to [[Haiti]], but failed in his attempts to establish a naval base there.<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 126&ndash;128</ref>

The first international crisis Harrison had to face occurred over fishing rights on the [[Alaska]]n coast. [[Canada]] claimed fishing and [[Seal hunting|sealing]] rights around many of the [[Aleutian Islands]], in violation of U.S. law.<ref name=s137>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 137&ndash;138</ref> As a result, the [[United States Navy]] seized several Canadian ships.<ref name=s137/> In 1891, the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over fishing rights after international arbitration, with the British government paying compensation in 1898.<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], pp. 135&ndash;136; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 139&ndash;143</ref>

[[Image:Uss baltimore c-3.jpg|thumb|Sailors from the [[USS Baltimore (C-3)|USS ''Baltimore'']] caused the major foreign affairs crisis of Harrison's administration.]]
In 1891, a diplomatic crisis arose in [[Chile]], later called the [[Baltimore Crisis|''Baltimore'' Crisis]]. The American minister to Chile, [[Patrick Egan (land reformer and diplomat)|Patrick Egan]], granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge from [[Chilean Civil War]].<ref>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], p. 146</ref> This raised tensions between Chile and the United States, and when sailors from the ''[[USS Baltimore (C-3)|Baltimore]]'' took [[shore leave]] in [[Valparaiso]], a fight broke out, resulting in the deaths of two dozen American sailors and three dozen arrested.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 127</ref> With Blaine out of town, Harrison himself drafted a demand for reparations.<ref name=c128>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 128&ndash;129; [[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 147&ndash;149</ref> The Chilean minister of foreign affairs replied that Harrison's message was "erroneous or deliberately incorrect," and said that the Chilean government was treating the affair the same as any other criminal matter.<ref name=c128/> Tensions increased as Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology.<ref name=c128/> Ultimately, after Blaine returned to the capital, the administration made conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government. After the letter was withdrawn, war was averted.<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], p. 134</ref>

In the last days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue of [[Hawaii]]an annexation. Following a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] against Queen [[Liliuokalani]], the new government of Hawaii led by [[Sanford B. Dole|Sanford Dole]] petitioned for annexation by the United States.<ref name=s204>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 204&ndash;205</ref> Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]] but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 125&ndash;126</ref> The United States [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Hawaii [[John L. Stevens]] recognized the new government on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation.<ref name=s204/> The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 132; [[#moore|Moore]], p. 147</ref>

===Supreme Court appointments===
[[File:DavidBrewer.jpg|thumb|Harrison appointed four Supreme Court justices, including [[David Josiah Brewer]].]]
Harrison appointed four justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. His first nominee was [[David Josiah Brewer]], a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]. Brewer, the nephew of Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field|Field]], had previously been considered for a cabinet position.<ref name=s188>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 188&ndash;190</ref> Shortly after Brewer's nomination, Justice [[Stanley Matthews (lawyer)|Matthews]] died, creating another vacancy. Harrison had considered [[Henry Billings Brown]], a [[Michigan]] judge and [[admiralty law]] expert, for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second.<ref name=s188/> For the third vacancy, which arose in 1892, Harrison nominated [[George Shiras, Jr.|George Shiras]]. Shiras's appointment was somewhat controversial because his age&mdash;sixty&mdash;was older than usual for a newly appointed Justice.<ref name=s188/>  Shiras also drew the opposition of Senator [[Matthew Quay]] of Pennsylvania because they were in different factions of the Pennsylvania Republican party, but his nomination was nonetheless approved.<ref name=s188/> Finally, at the end of his term, Harrison nominated [[Howell Edmunds Jackson]] to replace Justice [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lamar]], who died in January 1893. Harrison knew the incoming Senate would be controlled by Democrats, so he selected Jackson, a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he was friendly to ensure his nominee would not be rejected.<ref name=s188/> Jackson's nomination was indeed successful, but he died after only two years on the Court.<ref name=s188/>

===States admitted to the Union===
When Harrison took office, no new states had been admitted in more than a decade, owing to Congressional Democrats' reluctance to admit states that they believed would return Republican members. Early in Harrison's term, however, the lame-duck Congress passed bills that admitted four states to the union: [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]] on November 2, 1889, [[Montana]] on November 8, and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on November 11.<ref name=s44>[[#soco|Socolofsky & Spetter]], pp. 44&ndash;45</ref> The following year two more states held constitutional conventions and were admitted: [[Idaho]] on July 3 and [[Wyoming]] on July 10, 1890.<ref name=s44/> The initial Congressional delegations from all six states were solidly Republican.<ref name=s44/>  More states were admitted under Harrison's presidency than any other since [[George Washington]]'s.

===Reelection campaign in 1892===
[[Image:Bharrison.gif|thumb|Official [[White House]] portrait of Benjamin Harrison, painted by [[Eastman Johnson]]]]
Long before the end of the Harrison Administration, the treasury surplus had evaporated and the nation's economic health was worsening with the approach of the conditions that would lead to the [[Panic of 1893]].<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 107, 126&ndash;127</ref> Congressional elections in 1890 went against the Republicans, several party leaders withdrew their support for President Harrison, although he had cooperated with Congressional Republicans on legislation, and it was clear that Harrison would not be re-nominated unanimously.<ref name=c134>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 134&ndash;137</ref> Many of Harrison's detractors pushed for the nomination of Blaine, until Blaine publicly proclaimed himself not to be a candidate in February 1892.<ref name=c134/> Some party leaders still hoped to draft Blaine into running, and speculation increased when Blaine resigned as Secretary of State in June.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 138&ndash;139</ref> At the [[1892 Republican National Convention|convention]] in [[Minneapolis]], Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but not without significant opposition.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 140&ndash;141</ref>

[[Image:1892 Electoral Map.png|thumb|left|Results of the 1892 election, with states won by Harrison in <span style="color:red">red</span>, those won by [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]] in <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, and those won by [[James Weaver|Weaver]] in <span style="color:green">green</span>.]]
The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier. The issue of the tariff had worked to the Republicans' advantage in 1888, but the revisions of the past four years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position.<ref name=c147>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 147&ndash;150</ref> Many westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to the new [[Populist Party]] candidate, [[James Weaver]], who promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]].<ref name=c145>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 145&ndash;147</ref> The effects of the suppression of the [[Homestead Strike]] rebounded against the Republicans as well, even though no federal action was involved.<ref name=c145/>

Just two weeks before the election, on October 25, Harrison's wife Caroline died after a long battle with [[tuberculosis]].<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 149</ref> Harrison did not actively campaign on his own behalf during his reelection bid and remained with his wife. Their daughter [[Mary Harrison McKee]] continued the duties of the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] after her mother's death.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 156; [[#moore|Moore]], pp. 143&ndash;145</ref>

Neither Harrison nor Cleveland actively campaigned during the election<U+2014>the first time no candidate campaigned in a presidential election.<ref name = m146>[[#moore|Moore]], p. 146</ref> Cleveland ultimately won the election with 227 electoral votes to Harrison's 145. Cleveland also won in the popular vote 5,556,918 to 5,176,108.<ref>{{National Archives EV source|year=1892| as of=February 22, 2008}}</ref>

==Post-presidency==
[[Image:Grave of President Benjamin Harrison and his two wives in Indianapolis, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of President Harrison and his two wives in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]]]
After he left office, Harrison returned to Indianapolis.<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], 150</ref> In 1896 he remarried, to [[Mary Dimmick Harrison|Mary Scott Lord Dimmick]], the niece of his deceased wife, and 25 years his junior. Harrison's two adult children, Russell, 41 years old at the time, and Mary (Mamie), 38, did not attend the wedding because they disagreed with their father's marriage. Benjamin and Mary had one child, [[Elizabeth Harrison|Elizabeth]] (February 21, 1897 &ndash; December 26, 1955).<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], 153</ref> In 1899 Harrison went to the [[Hague Convention of 1899|First Peace Conference]] at [[The Hague]]. He wrote a series of articles about the Federal government and the presidency, which were re-published in 1918 as a book titled ''This Country of Ours''.<ref>{{cite book|title=This Country of Ours|author=Benjamin Harrison|year=1918|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=InsAAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>  For a few months in 1894, he moved to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and taught and gave law lectures at [[Stanford University]].<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], p. 158</ref>  In 1896 some of Harrison's friends in the Republican party tried to convince him to seek the presidency again, but he declined and openly supported [[William McKinley]] and traveled around the nation making appearances and speeches on McKinley's behalf.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 160&ndash;161</ref>

In 1900 Harrison served as an attorney for the Republic of [[Venezuela]] in their [[Schomburgk Line|boundary dispute]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].<ref>[[#moore|Moore]], 155</ref> The two nations disputed the border between Venezuela and [[British Guiana]]. An international trial was agreed upon and the Venezuelan government hired Harrison to represent them in the case. He filed an 800-page brief on their behalf and traveled to [[Paris]] where he spent more than 25 hours arguing in court. Although he lost the case, his legal arguments won him international renown.<ref>[[#calhoun|Calhoun]], pp. 160&ndash;163</ref> 

Harrison developed a heavy cold in February 1901. Despite treatment by steam vapor inhalation, his condition only worsened, and he died from [[influenza]] and [[pneumonia]] at [[Benjamin Harrison Home|his home]] on Wednesday, March 13, 1901, at the age of 67. Harrison is interred in Indianapolis's [[Crown Hill Cemetery]], along with both of his wives. <ref>[[#moore|Moore]], 156</ref>
