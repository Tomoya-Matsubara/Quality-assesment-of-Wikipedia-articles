{{History of Mumbai}}
The '''History of Mumbai''' recounts the growth of [[Mumbai]] from a collection of [[Seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]] on the [[Geography of India#West coast|western coast]] of [[India]] becoming the commercial capital of the nation and one of the [[List of cities proper by population|most populous cities in the world]]. Although human habitation existed during the [[Stone Age]], the [[Kolis]] were the earliest settlers of the islands. The [[Maurya Empire]]  gained control of the islands during the third century BCE, and transformed it into a centre for [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] culture and religion. The [[Satavahana]]s, [[Abhiras]], [[Vakatakas]], [[Kalachuri]]s, [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] ruled the islands later, before it fell to the [[Silhara dynasty]] from 810 to 1260.

[[Raja Bhimdev|King Bhimdev]] founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century, and brought many settlers to the islands. The [[Muzaffarid dynasty]] of [[Gujarat]] captured the islands in 1343 ending the Hindu sovereignty over the islands. The [[Treaty of Bassein (1534)|Treaty of Bassein]] between the Portuguese and [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Sultan Bahadur Shah]] of the [[Gujarat Sultanate]] placed the islands into Portuguese possession in 1534. [[Charles II of England]] received possession of the islands in 1661 as the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine de Braganza]], and he later leased them to the [[British East India Company]] in 1668. The city was named '''Bombay''' by the [[British Empire|British]].

The islands suffered incursions from [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s towards the end of the 17th century. During the mid-18th century, the city emerged as an important trading town, with maritime trade contacts with [[Mecca]] and [[Basra]]. Economic and educational development characterised the city during the 19th century with the first-ever Indian railway line beginning operations between Bombay and neighbouring [[Thane]] in 1853. The city became a strong base of the [[Indian independence movement]] during the early 20th century and was the main centre of the [[Rowlatt Satyagraha]] of 1919 and [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]] of 1946.

In 1960, following protests from the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra movement]], the city was "transferred" from the [[State of Bombay]] and incorporated into the dominion of the newly created [[Maharashtra]] [[States and territories of India|State]]. The city's secular fabric was torn apart in the [[Bombay Riots|communal riots of 1992<U+2013>93]], while the [[1993 Bombay bombings|bombings of 1993]] caused extensive loss of life and property. The name of the city was changed from '''Bombay''' to '''Mumbai''' in 1996. The city suffered [[Terrorism in Mumbai|several terrorist attacks]] during the 21st century.

Geologists believe that coast of western India came into being around 100 to 80&nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|mya]] after it broke away from [[Madagascar]]. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the [[R<U+00E9>union hotspot]], a volcanic hotspot in the earth's lithosphere near the island of [[R<U+00E9>union]]. An eruption here some 65&nbsp;mya is thought to have laid down the [[Deccan Traps]], a vast bed of [[basalt]] [[lava]] that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the [[Gilbert Hill]], that are seen at various locations in the city. Further [[tectonic]] activity in the region led to the formation of hilly islands separated by a shallow sea.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1986|loc=[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/greater_bombay/general.html#2 Geology]|Ref=bom}}</ref> [[Pleistocene]] sediments found near [[Kandivali]] in northern Bombay by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 posit the theory that these islands were inhabited since the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ghosh|1990|p=[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=PKw3AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#PPA25,M1 25]|Ref=brill}}</ref> The islands were incorporated into the [[Maurya Empire]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] of [[Magadha]] in the third century BCE.
