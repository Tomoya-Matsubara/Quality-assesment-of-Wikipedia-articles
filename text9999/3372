'''Babar the Elephant''' is a French [[children's literature|children's]] [[fictional character]] who first appeared in ''Histoire de Babar'' by [[Jean de Brunhoff]] in 1931 and enjoyed immediate success.<ref>{{cite news|title= Why Babar the Elephant just can't forget his colonial past |publisher= Times|date=2006-08-08|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article602843.ece|accessdate=2010-08-25 | location=London | first=Charles | last=Bremner}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Babar the Elephant Still Reigns at Age 61|publisher= LA Times|date=1991-05-19|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-19/news/mn-2984_1_babar-products|accessdate=2010-08-25 | first=Marilyn | last=August}}</ref>  An [[English language]] version, entitled ''The Story of Babar'', appeared in 1933 in Britain and also in the United States.

Jean de Brunhoff published six more stories before his death in 1937. His son [[Laurent de Brunhoff]], also a writer and illustrator, carried on the series from 1946 onwards with ''Babar et Le Coquin d'Arthur''.<ref>{{cite news|title= All About Mr. Elephant, in His Becoming Green Suit |publisher= The New York Times |date=2008-09-22|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/arts/design/22baba.html?fta=y|accessdate=2010-08-26 | first=Edward | last=Rothstein}}</ref>

An [[Babar (TV series)|animated TV series]] was produced in Canada by [[Nelvana]] Limited and Clifford Ross Company, and originally ran from January 3, 1989 to June 5, 1991 with 65 episodes, plus an additional 13 episodes in 2000.  The character has also appeared in a number of films, and the Babar stories have inspired musical works by [[Francis Poulenc]] and Raphael Mostel.

==Story synopsis==
After Babar's mother is shot by a [[hunter]], he flees the jungle and finds his way to an unspecified big city with no particular characteristics<ref>Stating, as it is sometimes done, that the city is Paris is wrong. No recognisable building of Paris or, for that matter, any other larger town is shown in any of the drawings. Since Babar flees by foot, the city must anyway be located in Africa, although its population as it is drawn is exclusively white.</ref> where he is befriended by an old lady, who buys him clothes and enrolls him in school. Babar's cousins Celeste and Arthur find him in the big city and help him return to the [[Babar's Kingdom|Elephant realm]] following the death of the King of the Elephants, who had eaten a poisonous mushroom. A council of elephants approach Babar, saying that as he has "lived among men and learned much", he would be suitable to become the new King. Babar is [[coronation|crowned]] King of the Elephants, marries his cousin '''Celeste''', and founds the city of Celesteville. Babar, who likes to wear a bright green [[Suit (clothing)|suit]], introduces a very [[Culture of France|French form of Western civilization]] to the elephants, and they soon dress in [[Western culture|Western]] attire.

Among Babar's other associates are the [[monkey]] '''Zephir''', the old elephant [[Councillor|counsellor]]s '''Cornelius''' and '''Pompadour''' (Pompadour was created for the [[Babar (TV series)|''Babar'' TV series]]), his cousin '''Arthur''', and his children, '''Pom''', '''Flora''', and '''Alexander'''. Later, a second daughter, '''Isabelle''', was introduced. '''The Old Lady''' comes to live in the Kingdom as an honoured guest. Despite the presence of these counsellors, Babar's rule seems to be totally independent of any elected body, and completely [[autocratic]]; however his leadership style seems to be one that works for the overall benefit of his elephant subjects; a form of [[benevolent dictator]].

Besides his Westernizing policies, Babar engages in [[warfare]] with the warlike [[rhinoceros]]es of a hostile bordering nation, who are led by [[Lord Rataxes]].

== Pronunciation ==

According to Laurent de Brunhoff, Babar's name is {{pron-en|<U+02C8>b<U+028C>b<U+0251>r}},<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZnlH6bhi5o Laurent de Brunhoff - Exclusive Video Interview at YouTube.]</ref> although it has been popularly {{pron-en|<U+02C8>b<U+00E6>b<U+0251>r}}.<ref>Examples of this pronunciation can be found on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67B1vCjQlcc YouTube]</ref> This can be distinguished from [[Babur]] or Babar ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>b<U+0251><U+02D0>b<U+0259>r}}), the first [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor of medieval India.

==Legacy==
The series has over 100 licensees worldwide, and the "Babar" brand has a multi-generational following. There are 12 Babar stores in Japan. A global cultural phenomenon, whose fans span generations, Babar stands along side Mickey Mouse as one of the most recognized children's characters in the world. There are now over 30,000 Babar publications in over 17 languages, and over 8 million books have been sold. Laurent de Brunhoff's Babar's Yoga for Elephants is a top seller in the U.S with over 100,000 copies sold to date. The Babar series of books are recommended reading on First Lady Laura Bush's national reading initiative list. All 78 episodes of the [[Babar (TV series)|TV series]] are broadcast in 30 languages in over 150 countries, making Babar one of the largest distributed animation shows in history. Babar has been a perennial favorite for years at the White House Easter Egg Roll.<ref name="treehouse">{{cite web | url=http://babar.treehousetv.com/index.asp | title=Babar at Treehouse | accessdate=2011-01-03}}</ref>

Since 2001 The Babar franchise has been owned by [[Corus Entertainment]]'s Nelvana in conjunction with the artist, [[Clifford Ross]] <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Corus+Entertainment's+Nelvana+and+The+Clifford+Ross+Company+Announce...-a079751903|title=Nelvana and The Clifford Ross Company   Enter Into Five-Year Administration Deal|date=Nov. 5, 2001|work=Business Wire|publisher=The Free Library|accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref>.

==Criticism==
Some writers, notably [[Herbert Kohl (education)|Herbert R. Kohl]] and [[Vivian Paley]],<ref>Kohl, Herbert R. ''Should We Burn Babar?: Essays On Children's Literature And The Power Of Stories''; Introduction by Jack Zipes, New Press (2007) ISBN 1595581308</ref> have argued that, although superficially delightful, the stories are politically and morally offensive and can be seen as a justification for [[colonialism]]. Others argue that the French civilisation described in the early books had already been destroyed by the [[Great War]] and the books were originally an exercise in [[nostalgia]] for pre-1914 France. [[Ariel Dorfman]]<U+2019>s ''The Empire<U+2019>s Old Clothes''<ref>Dorfman, Ariel. ''The Empire's Old Clothes: What the Lone Ranger, Babar, and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds'', Penguin (1996), ISBN 978082234671-5</ref>  is another highly critical view, in which he concludes, "In imagining the independence of the land of the elephants, Jean de Brunhoff anticipates, more than a decade before history forced Europe to put it into practice, the theory of [[neocolonialism]]." Adam Gopnik has a different point of view. In ''Freeing the Elephants'' he writes that it "is not an unconscious expression of the French colonial imagination; it is a self-conscious comedy about the French colonial imagination and its close relation to the French domestic imagination. The gist ... is explicit and intelligent: the lure of the city, of civilization, of style and order and bourgeois living is real, for elephants as for humans."<ref name=Gopnik>Gopnik, Adam. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/09/22/080922fa_fact_gopnik Freeing the Elephants], ''The New Yorker'', September 22, 2008. Written for ''Drawing Babar: Early Drafts and Watercolors'', Morgan Library and Museum, 2008, ISBN 978-0875981512</ref> He concludes that the satisfaction derived from ''Babar'' is based on the knowledge that "while it is a very good thing to be an elephant, still, the life of an elephant is dangerous, wild, and painful. It is therefore a safer thing to be an elephant in a house near a park."<ref name=Gopnik />
