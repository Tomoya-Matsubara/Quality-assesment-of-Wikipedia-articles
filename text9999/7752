'''Joe Murray''' (born May 3, 1961 in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]] <ref name="BioWeb">"[http://www.joemurraystudio.com/bio/bio.shtml Bio]," ''Joe Murray Studio''</ref>) is an [[animator]], best known as the creator of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' and ''[[Camp Lazlo]]''.

==Career==
===Early career===
Raised in San Jose <ref name="BioWeb"/>, Joe Murray said that he developed an interest in working as an artist as a career when he was three years old. According to Murray, his [[kindergarten]] teacher told his mother that he was the only student who drew [[zipper]]s on [[trousers]] and breasts on women. Murray credits his [[high school]] art teacher Mark Briggs for teaching him "so much about my art." <ref name="TrainorMurray">"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/murray.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life]," ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref><ref>"[http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=977 May 1, 2009]." ''Joe Murray Studio''. Retrieved on May 3, 2009.</ref> Since 16 he served as a full-time artist. <ref name="BioWeb"/>

When he served as a [[political cartoonist]] for a newspaper in San Jose, he targeted [[Jimmy Carter]], the [[President of the United States]]. On his website, in a 2007 entry he said that he admired Carter's post-presidential work. <ref>"[http://www.joemurraystudio.com/journal/12-journal_11.08.07.shtml November 8, 2007]," ''Joe Murray Studio''</ref>

As a young adult, he was hired as a designer at an agency. Murray invested his earnings from the company into independent animated films. At age 20, Murray founded his independent illustration company, Joe Murray Studios, in 1981  while still in university. His early attempts at animation date back to 1986 when he joined [[California Institute of the Arts]]. Murray created several short animated films, his most successful was made in 1987, which was a two minute animated short titled "The Chore," which focused on a harried husband who uses his cat as a novel solution while not wanting to do a chore for his wife. He drew the scenes on typing paper and shot the scenes with 16&nbsp;mm film. For creating "The Chore" Murray earned the Student Academy Award two years later in 1989. <ref name="independentfilmwork">{{cite web|url=http://www.joemurraystudio.com/indie/indie.shtml|title=Independent Filmwork|work=Joe Murray Studio|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>

In 1988 he joined [[MTV]] as an animator for the MTV commercials, and left in 1991  in hopes of starting his own projects. One of the MTV eyecatches Murray created involved the future ''Rocko's Modern Life'' character [[Heffer Wolfe]]; the eyecatch  featured the MTV logo branded onto Heffer's buttocks.<ref name="TrainorMurray"/>

==="My Dog Zero"===
"My Dog Zero," released in 1992, was Murray's third independent film and first color film. Murray said that "My Dog Zero" was his "most gratifying" artistic project to date because of his own "stubbornness" in resolving the obstacles and issues involved in the production, such as lack of funding and lack of resources. With a grant he employed twelve people, mostly university students, to cel paint the film. According to Murray, when he finished the film, several distributors refused to air it. He appeared at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco with a copy of the film and persuaded the staff to air the film with the scheduled films. According to Murray, "My Dog Zero" received "good response." <ref name="independentfilmwork"/>

To fund the film Murray initially tried to pre-sell the television show rights to "My Dog Zero" but instead created a separate television series called ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''.<ref name="TrainorMurray"/>

===''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''===
* ''Main article: [[Rocko's Modern Life]]''
Murray created and was the executive producer for the animated series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which aired on Nickelodeon from 1993  to 1996.

Originally, the character Rocko appeared in an unpublished comic book titled ''Travis''. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, but was never successful of getting it in production. Murray wanted funding for "My Dog Zero," so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. Murray presented a pencil test to [[Nickelodeon Studios]], which afterwards became interested in buying and airing the show. After deciding that "My Dog Zero" would not work as a television series, Murray combed through his sketchbooks, developed the Rocko's Modern Life concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. According to Murray, around three or four months later he had "forgotten about" the concept and was working on "My Dog Zero" when [[Linda Simensky]] informed Murray that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for "My Dog Zero." <ref name="TrainorMurray"/>

The pilot episode, "[[Trash-O-Madness]]" was completed and shown to Nickelodeon executives before any other episodes were produced.  To Murray's surprise, Nickelodeon approved new seasons. After season 3 he decided to hand the project to [[Stephen Hillenburg]], who performed most work for season 4 and created ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' shortly after that; Murray continued to manage the cartoon. <ref name="TrainorMurray"/> Murray said that he would completely leave the production after season 4. Murray said that he encouraged the network to continue production. Nickelodeon decided to cancel the series. Murray described all fifty-two episodes as "top notch" and that, in his view, the quality of a television show may decline as production continues "when you are dealing with volume." <ref name="TrainorMurray"/>

===Post-''Rocko's Modern Life''===

After completing 52 episodes of ''Rocko's Modern Life'', Murray took a break from the animation business and produced two children's books and illustrated two children's books<ref name="ChildrensBooks">"[http://joemurraystudio.com/art/books.shtml Children's Books]," ''Joe Murray Studio''</ref>: ''Who Asked the Moon to Dinner?'' (1999)<ref name="SmallMoon">"[http://smallfellow.com/SM_Bk_Moon.htm Who Asked the Moon to Dinner?]," ''Smallfellow Press''</ref><ref name="Paint">"[http://joemurraystudio.com/art/art.shtml Paintings Gallery One]," ''Joe Murray''</ref>, ''The Enormous Mister Schmupsle: An ABC Adventure'' (2003)<ref name="Paint"/><ref name="SmallEnorm">"[http://smallfellow.com/SM_bk_Schmupsle.htm The Enormous Mr. Schmupsle!]," ''Smallfellow Press''</ref>, ''Hugville'' (written by Court Crandall) (2005)<ref name="HugAmazon">"[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0375824189 Hugville]," ''[[Amazon.com]]''</ref>, and ''Funny Cryptograms'' (written by Shawn Kennedy).

Murray was working on a web-based cartoon named ''The Family Pop'', which was produced in Flash and was in the middle of negotiations for this cartoon just prior to the onset of ''Camp Lazlo''.<ref name="crafting">{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Joe|title=Crafting A Cartoon|publisher=Garden Box Media Group|date=2008|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?page_id=346}}</ref> On September 30, 2008, Murray added a new feature to his website, '''The Tin Box''', where Murray posts some of his independent work. The first work posted was '''Where<U+2019>s Poppa''', a short episode of ''[[The Family Pop]]''.<ref name="sept30">{{cite web|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=466|title=Joe Murray's Journal September 30, 2008|publisher=Joe Murray Studios|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref>

===''[[Camp Lazlo]]''===
* ''Main article: [[Camp Lazlo]]''
Murray decided to return to television cartooning, this time selling his work to [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. In 2005 , he produced a pilot for the cartoon ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', which was picked-up for a 13 episode first season and ran for five seasons, with production ending in November 2007. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turnerinfo.com/presskititem.aspx?P=CARTOON&CID01=a97e4cd3-7a0b-4b0c-b126-1a03a9c9ca06&CID02=a97e4cd3-7a0b-4b0c-b126-1a03a9c9ca06|title=Cartoon Network pressroom, Camp Lazlo|accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>

On September 8, 2007, the TV movie "[[Where's Lazlo?]]" won an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Animated Program (For an hour or more). <ref name="Emmy 2007">Emmy winner for 2007 - http://www.emmys.tv/awards/2007pt/nominations.php?action=search_db</ref>

===Post-''Camp Lazlo''===
Once production finished for ''Camp Lazlo'', and the final episodes were delivered, Murray developed a new television series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=138|title=Joe Murray Studio's Journal for June 23, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> While he is working out details about production and distribution, he has started work on his next independent film project, ''Fish head'', <ref name="fish"/> and publishing ''Crafting A Cartoon'', a book on creating and producing an animated TV series, <ref name="craft"/><ref name="craft1">{{cite web|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?page_id=346|title=Joe Murray's Journal: Crafting A Cartoon|publisher=Joe Murray Studios|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> and working on producing a new short series.<ref name="sept30" />

==Character creation process==
On his personal website, Murray describes his character creation process <ref>"[http://joemurraystudio.com/tv/museum.shtml Character Museum]," ''Joe Murray Studio''. Retrieved on December 22, 2008.</ref> as "sometimes like playing [[Frankenstein]]."
* He starts with the personality. He shapes the conditions that make the character "tick," the character's imperfections, and the appeal. He asks himself, "Why would I want to tell stories about them?"
* If he is working with an [[anthropomorphic]] series or book with varying animals, he chooses an animal that, in his eyes, match the created personality. According to Murray, this resulted in a social [[caricature]] in ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. <ref name="CNMurrayInterview">"[http://turnerinfo.turner.com/presskititem.aspx?P=CARTOON&CID01=98376fcf-3e6c-44a0-aae0-9e41e16079ef&CID02=a97e4cd3-7a0b-4b0c-b126-1a03a9c9ca06 Q & A with Joe Murray]," ''[[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]] Pressroom''</ref>
* If he is working with an anthropomorphic series or book using one animal, he alters the specific character design to match the personality.
* Murray likes to use vary eyeballs by size and color. He also varies nostrils. Murray believes that inconsistencies "make it more interesting"
* Murray then selects colors that, in his view, "feels right." He believes that yellow and bright colors "match a mood." If a character is "negative," he will pick a color that, in his opinion, matches the character.
* If he has to teach a crew of artists how to draw the character, he creates a model sheet for the character.

Murray says that one of the interesting aspects of character creation is the evolution of the personalities over time. In a one-time movie, the characters will have a static personality, but for a television series, the characters will change from season to season, developing new relationships, and even changing from mere background characters into a main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=113|title=Joe Murray's Journal, May 27, 2008}}</ref>
