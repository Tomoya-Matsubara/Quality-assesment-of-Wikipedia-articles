'''Christopher Darrell Matthews''' (born [[September 22]], [[1962]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]) is a former [[Australia]]n [[cricketer]], who played for the [[Australian cricket team]], the [[Western Warriors]], [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]], and the [[Tasmanian Tigers]].   
Chris Matthews was an excellent left arm fast bowler, who generated lively pace, and performed well in the test arena, but was overshadowed by the emergence of young [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] firebrand, [[Craig McDermott]], and never had the opportunity to show his true talent.
Matthews signed for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] in 1988, but only managed three matches for them. He returned to Western Australia, but failed to hold down a regular spot, and so moved to the [[Tasmanian Tiger]]'s in 1990, where he became highly successful, taking 119 wickets for them before retiring at the end of the 1994-95 season.
