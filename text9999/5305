==History== 
{{history of private equity and venture capital}}
Apollo, originally referred to as Apollo Advisors, was founded in 1990, on the heels of the collapse of [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] in February 1990. It was founded by [[Leon Black]], the former head of Drexel's mergers and acquisitions department, along with other Drexel alumni.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D8143CF934A25751C1A96E948260 Drexel Divided on Settlement].  New York Times, December 17, 1988</ref>  Among the most notable founders are John Hannan, Drexel's former co-director of international finance; Craig Cogut, a lawyer who worked with Drexel's high-yield division in Los Angeles; and Arthur Bilger, the former head of the corporate finance department.  Other founding partners included Marc Rowan and Michael Gross, who both worked under Black in the mergers and acquisitions department and Tony Ressler, who worked as a senior vice president in Drexel's high yield department with responsibilities for the responsibility for the new issue/syndicate desk.<ref name=fruitofloom>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DD173BF937A1575BC0A966958260 Ex-Drexel Executives Arrange Aid for Fruit of the Loom], August 24, 1990</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DE1139F932A25750C0A96F948260 Changes at Drexel Continue].

Less than six months after the collapse of Drexel, the founders of Apollo had already begun a series of ventures.  Apollo Investment Fund L.P., the first of their private equity investment funds was formed to make investments in distressed companies. Apollo's first fund raised approximately $400 million of investor commitments on the strength of Black's reputation as a prominent lieutenant of [[Michael Milken]] and key player in the [[private equity in the 1980s|buyout boom of the 1980s]].<ref name=fruitofloom />  Lion Advisors was set up to provide investment services to Credit Lyonnais, which was seeking to profit from depressed prices in the high yield market.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD6103BF935A15752C0A963958260 Bailing Out France's Biggest Bank].

===1990s===
At that time of Apollo's founding, financing for new leveraged buyouts was minimal and Apollo turned instead to a strategy of distressed-to-control takeovers.<ref>Altman, Edward I.

New York Times, May 22, 1993.</ref>.

Early on, Apollo made a name for itself by acquiring interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasing [[high-yield bond]]s from failed [[savings and loan]]s and insurance companies.  Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from the U.S. government's [[Resolution Trust Corporation]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/business/economy/11react.html Washington Hopes 'Vulture' Investors Will Buy Bad Assets].  New York Times, February 10, 2009</ref>  One of Apollo's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company's bond portfolio.  Using this vehicle, Apollo would purchase the Executive Life portfolio, generating tremendous profits when the value of high yield bonds recovered, but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D91131F930A25757C0A967958260 European Group Pressing Its Offer for Executive Life], April 13, 1991</ref> More than a decade after the purchase, in 2002, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer accused Apollo, Leon Black, and an investor group led by French bank Credit Lyonnais, of illegally acquiring the assets and bond portfolio of Executive Life Insurance Co. in 1991.  According to the State of California, Lion allegedly violated a California law that prohibited foreign government-owned banks from owning California insurance companies.<ref>[http://www.rmi.gsu.edu/rmi/faculty/klein/RMI_3500/Readings/Other/ExecLife_Indictments.htm  Executive Life Indictments Brought].

Apollo deployed its fourth fund during the [[private equity in the 1990s|booming markets of the late 1990s]], only to experience difficulties with the collapse of the Internet bubble and the onset of the recession.  Amid the turmoil of collapsing markets, Apollo was able to raise its fifth private equity fund in 2001, Apollo Investment Fund V, with $3.7 billion of investor commitments, roughly the same amount raised as for its previous fund.<ref name=doubletrouble />  Among the investments made in Fund V (invested through 2006) were [[Affinion Group]], [[AMC Entertainment]], [[Berry Plastics]], [[Cablecom]], [[Compass Minerals]], [[General Nutrition Centers]] (GNC), Goodman Global, [[Hexion Specialty Chemicals]] ([[Borden (company)|Borden]]), [[Intelsat]], [[Linens <U+2018>n Things]], Metals USA, [[Nalco Investment Holdings]], Sourcecorp, [[Spectrasite Communications]], Unity Media.

Meanwhile, Ares continued to grow through the late 1990s, and profited significantly from investments made after the collapse of the high yield market in 2000 and 2001.  Although technically, the founders of Ares had completed a [[spin out]] with the formation of the firm in 1997, they had maintained a close relationship with Apollo over its first five years and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo. By 2002, when Ares raised its first corporate opportunities fund, the firm announced that it was more formally separating itself from its former parent company.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/banking-finance/financial-markets-investing-investment/5716081-1.html Fitch Assigns Ares Management CDO Asset Manager Ratings].  Business Wire, February 25 2003</ref>   The timing of this separation also coincided with Apollo's legal difficulties with the State of California over its purchase of [[Executive Life Insurance Company]] in 1991.

Following the spin-off of Ares in 2002, Apollo developed two new affiliates to continue its investment activities in the capital markets. The first of these new affiliates, founded in 2003, was Apollo Distressed Investment Fund (DIF) Management a credit opportunity investment vehicle.<ref>[http://www.thedailydeal.com/NASApp/cs/CS?pagename=ABI&c=TDDArticle&cid=1054560360951 Apollo raising distressed-debt fund].

Apollo Investment Corporation was formed  to invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of [[mezzanine debt]] and [[secured loan|senior secured loans]], as well as by making certain direct equity investments in companies. The Company also invests in the securities of public companies.<ref name=closedendfunds /><ref name=sellstake>Sorkin, Andrew Ross.

Among Apollo's most notable investments during this period included [[Harrah's Entertainment]], a leading US gaming and casino company; [[Norwegian Cruise Line]], the cruise line operator; [[Claire's Stores]], the retailer of costume jewelry; and [[Realogy]], the real estate franchisor that owns [[Coldwell Banker]], [[Century 21]] and [[Sotheby's International Realty]].<ref name=apollolimits>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/business/07leon.html In Private Equity, the Limits of Apollo<U+2019>s Power].

As the private equity industry expanded through 2006 and 2007, several of the largest private equity firms, most notably [[The Blackstone Group]] and [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], announced plans to realize value from their firms through the sale of shares in the public equity markets.  Apollo Management chose a slightly different path, by completing a [[private placement]] of shares in its management company in July 2007.  By pursuing a private placement rather than a public offering, Apollo would be able to avoid much of the public scrutiny applied to Blackstone and KKR.<ref>Sorkin, Andrew Ross and De La Merced, Michael J.

As the [[Global financial crisis of 2008<U+2013>2009|deterioration of the financial markets]] worsened into 2008, Apollo saw several of its investments come under pressure.  Apollo's 2005 investment in the struggling US retailer, [[Linens 'n Things]] suffered from a significant debt burden and softening consumer demand.  In May 2008, Linens was forced to file for bankruptcy protection, one of several high profile retail bankruptcies in 2008, costing Apollo all of its $365 million investment in the company.<ref name=sinkinglinens /><ref name=linensbankrupt />  At the same time, Apollo's investment in [[Claire's]], [[Realogy]] and [[Harrah's Entertainment]] came under pressure.<ref name=apollolimits />  Apollo would respond actively to its investment difficulties seeking to [[exchange offer|exchange]] a portion of the existing debt at Harrah's and Realogy to more favorable securities<ref name=bondholderendrun />.  At Claire's, Apollo exercised its "[[PIK toggle]]" option to shut off cash interest payments to its bondholders and issue more debt instead, in order to provide the company with additional financial flexibility.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121115406191402197.html PIK and Roll: Companies Seize On Perks of Loose Lending ].

===Lion Advisors===
Lion Advisors (or Lion Capital), which was founded at the same time as Apollo in 1990, focused on investment management and consulting services to foreign institutional accounts targeting investments in public and private high yield debt securities in the US.  In 1992, Lion entered into a more formal arrangement to manage the $3 billion high-yield portfolio for Credit Lyonnais which together with a consortium of other international investors provided the capital for Lion's investment activities.  The Lion business would ultimately be replaced by Ares Management.<ref name=aresprospectus>[http://www.financialregulator.ie/data/in_mark_prosp/10270%20Prospectus.pdf Ares Enhanced Loan Investment Strategy IR, Ltd.

Ares Management, founded in 1997, was established initially was formed to manage a $1.2 billion [[Collateralized debt obligation#Structures|market value collateralized debt obligation vehicle]].  Ares would grow to manage a family of [[collateralized loan obligation]] (CLO) vehicles that would invest in capital markets-based securities including senior bank loans and high-yield and mezzanine debt.  Ares was founded by Anthony Ressler and John H. Kissick, both partners at Apollo as well as Bennett Rosenthal, who joined the group from the global leveraged finance group at [[Merrill Lynch]].<ref name=newfundpublic>[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/22/business/fi-ares22 Ares Management to Take New Fund Public].

Ares I and II which were raised were structured as [[Collateralized debt obligation#Structures|market value CLOs]].  Ares III though Ares X  were structured as [[Collateralized debt obligation#Structures|cash flow CLOs]].  In 2002, Ares completed a spinout from Apollo management.  Although technically, the founders of Ares had completed a spinout with the formation of the firm in 1997, they had maintained a close relationship with Apollo over its first five years and operated as the West Coast affiliate of Apollo.   Shortly thereafter, Ares completed fundraising for Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund, a special situations investment fund with $750 million of capital under management.<ref name=newfundpublic /><ref name=aresprospectus />

AREA Property Partners, originally Apollo Real Estate, was founded in 1993 by William Mack, to take advantage of opportunities to purchase distressed properties as many real estate markets crashed in the early 1990s.<ref>[http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alum_mag/issues/125anniversaryissue/mack.html He Made Real Estate a Science: William L. Mack, W<U+2019>61].  Wharton School of Business Alumni Magazine, Spring 2007</ref>  

Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund, L.P., the first in a family of real estate <U+201C>opportunity funds<U+201D> was closed in April 1993 with $500 million of investor commitments.  As of 2008, the firm was investing out of three funds: Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund V, Apollo European Real Estate Fund II and Apollo Value Enhancement Fund VII. In 2004, Apollo Real Estate acquired the Value Enhancement Funds family of investment vehicles to broaden its offerings in the <U+201C>value-added<U+201D> segment of the real estate investment spectrum. Apollo also operates a real estate mezzanine lending program.<ref>[http://www.hedgeweek.com/articles/detail.jsp?content_id=259781 Apollo Real Estate Advisors closes Apollo Value Enhancement Fund VII with USD758m].
