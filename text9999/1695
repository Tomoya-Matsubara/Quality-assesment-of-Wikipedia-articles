The '''AM''' (A Modified) type submarine was a large seaplane-carrying submarine of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], with a hangar space for 2 aircraft. These giant submarines were originally of the A2 type, but their design was revised after construction started so that they could carry a second aircraft.  The seaplanes were to be the [[Aichi M6A|Aichi M6A1]], bomber carrying 800&nbsp;kg bombs.  

The range and speed of these submarines was remarkable (21,000&nbsp;nm at 16&nbsp;knots), but their underwater performance was compromised, making them easy targets. I-13 was sunk on [[16 July]] [[1945]] by the destroyer escort [[USS Lawrence C. Taylor]] and aircraft action from escort carrier [[USS Anzio (CVE-57)|USS Anzio]] about 550&nbsp;miles east of [[Yokosuka]].  I-14 surrendered at sea at the end of the war, and was later scuttled off Oahu in 1946.
