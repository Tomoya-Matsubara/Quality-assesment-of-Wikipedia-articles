===History===
Formed in Toronto in 1977 the [[Rock band]] consisted of [[vocalist]] Denton Young, [[guitarist]] Brian Miller, [[bassist]] Jim Sampson, [[drummer]] Kim Hunt and [[keyboard]] player Howard Helm. They released just 3 albums over 5 years.
Don V. Lorusso produced the bands first album called 'Astral Projector', released on blue [[vinyl]]. The album  became an [[FM]] [[radio]] staple in the late '70's. The album garnered the band a 'Best New Group' [[Juno Award]]s<ref>{{cite web | title= Juno Award Winners and nominations | work=junoawards.ca|url=http://www.junoawards.ca/archive_past.php}}</ref> nomination. The band would find themselves opening up gigs for the likes of [[The Tubes]] at Toronto's [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], and with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and  [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] at [[CNE Stadium]] getting opening slot encores on both occasions!

1979's 'Back Down To Earth' was produced by Don V. Lorusso and the late [[Vancouver]] keyboard whiz [[Dale Jacobs]]. The band played [[Toronto]] as headliners where a hometown crowd swelled to 17,800 people. A reporter for the [[Globe & Mail]], who had only stayed to see the opening act, wrote a scathing review thinking he had seen Zon. The negative review was the headline of the entertainment page, nationally in Canada. [[CBS]] demanded compensation for the impact on Zon's popularity but neither the band, nor the label, ever recovered.

Zon was dropped from CBS after a thorough corporate housecleaning of the A & R Department despite Zon already having their contract picked up for a third album.

The ensuing legal battle took much of the heart out of the band, but they did manage one more album for [[Falcon Records]] called 'I'm Worried About The Boys' produced by then former CBS A & R man Bob Gallo. The record featured a cover version of the [[Velvet Underground]]'s "Sweet Jane".

As part of the 1980 tour to support the album, Zon did an opening slot for [[Alice Cooper]] at Toronto's [[CNE]] [[Stadium]]. When Cooper failed to appear minutes before showtime, Denton Young was given the onerous task of telling the audience. A riot ensued and police had to be called out. The band broke-up shortly after despite the 1981 single "For You" reaching #2 on CKOC in [[Hamilton]] (higher than any of the previous singles on CBS Records).

==After Zon==
Singer Denton Young most recently popped up on Rik Emmett's solo work; Kim Hunt would go on to join [[Hanover]], [[Urgent (Canadian band)|Urgent]] and is currently in [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]]; Jim Samson is now with [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]]; Roddi Chappell is in long running AOR band Lightspeed who released two CDs on Pacemaker in the '90s; Brian Miller works at Toronto's famed 12th Fret guitar store; Howard Helm joined Michael Fury which mutated into Refugee. In 1988 Helm was offered a job as touring keyboardist for Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter. He took the job and spent 4 years on the road touring the world. He is currently writing for [[TBS]] [[television]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. He continues to play keyboards in-studio for the likes of bands like Seven Mary Three and others.

At the moment Helm and his former Zon bandmates are contemplating a new studio album to coincide with the re-issues of that band's back catalogue on CD?
