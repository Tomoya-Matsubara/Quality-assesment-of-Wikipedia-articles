'''Ria Cortesio''' is a former American [[baseball]] [[umpire]], working games at the [[Minor League Baseball|Double A]] level. On March 29, 2007, she became the first woman since [[Pam Postema]] in 1989 to work a Major league exhibition game, serving alternately as the first and third base umpire in a spring training game between the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. The 2007 season was her ninth and final professional season and fifth at the Double A level. After being denied promotion for many years, she was released by the Minor League Baseball on October 30, 2007. Author Bruce Weber and female umpire Kate Sargeant claim that Ria was denied promotion due to sexism, possibly with her male superiors colluding against her.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alex|first=Remington|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/women-are-coming-to-baseball-like-it-or-not/|title=Women Are Coming to Baseball, Like It or Not|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>
