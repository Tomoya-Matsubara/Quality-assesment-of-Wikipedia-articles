'''''Nephrops norvegicus''''', known variously as the '''Norway lobster''', '''Dublin Bay prawn''', '''''{{lang|fr|langoustine}}''''' (compare [[langostino]]) or '''''[[scampi]]''''', is a slim, orange-pink [[lobster]] which grows up to {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, and is "the most important commercial crustacean in Europe".<ref name="Bell"/> It is now the only extant species in the genus ''[[Nephrops]]'', after several other species were moved to the closely related genus ''[[Metanephrops]]''. It lives in the north-eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], and parts of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], but is absent from the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. Adults emerge from their [[burrow]]s at night to feed on [[worm]]s and [[fish]].

''Nephrops norvegicus'' has the typical body shape of a [[lobster]], albeit narrower than the large ''[[Homarus]]'' species.<ref name="Bell">{{cite book |editor=Bruce F.

==Distribution==
''Nephrops norvegicus'' is found in the north-eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[North Sea]] as far north as [[Iceland]] and northern [[Norway]], and south to [[Portugal]]. It is not common in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] except in the [[Adriatic Sea]],<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] |title=Mediterranean Seafood |isbn=978-1580084512 |year=2002 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |pages=}}</ref> notably the north Adriatic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faoadriamed.org/html/Species/NephropsNorvegicus.html |title=''Nephrops norvegicus'' (Linnaeus, 1758) |work=AdriaMed |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]}}</ref> It is absent from both the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name="Bell"/> Due to its ecological demands for particular sediments, ''N.&nbsp;norvegicus'' has a very patchy distribution, and is divided into over 30 populations. These populations are separated by inhospitable terrain, and adults rarely travel distances greater than a few hundred metres.<ref name="Bell"/>

==Ecology==
[[File:Monaco.Mus<U+00E9>e oc<U+00E9>anographique083.jpg|thumb|A Norway lobster in its burrow, at the [[Oceanographic Museum]] in [[Monaco]]]]
''Nephrops norvegicus'' adults prefer to inhabit muddy seabed sediments, with more than 40 percent silt and clay.<ref name="Bell"/> Their [[burrow]]s are semi-permanent,<ref>{{cite journal |author=B. I. Dybern & T. Hoisaeter |year=1965 |title=The burrows of ''Nephrops norvegicus'' |journal=[[Sarsia]] |volume=21 |pages=49<U+2013>55}}</ref> and vary in structure and size. Typical burrows are {{convert|20|to|30|cm|0}} deep, with a distance of {{convert|50|to|80|cm}} between the front and back entrances.<ref name="Bell"/> Norway lobsters spend most of their time either lying in their burrows or by the entrance, only leaving their shelters to forage or mate.<ref name="Bell"/>

The most significant parasite of ''N.&nbsp;norvegicus'' is a  [[dinoflagellate]] of the genus ''[[Hematodinium]]'', which has caused [[epidemic]] infection in fished populations of ''N.&nbsp;norvegicus'' since the 1980s.<ref name="Stentiford"/> ''Hematodinium'' is a genus that contains major pathogens of a wide variety of decapod crustaceans, although its internal taxonomy is poorly resolved.<ref name="Stentiford"/> The species which attacks ''N.&nbsp;norvegicus'' causes a [[syndrome]] originally described as "post-moult syndrome", in which the [[carapace]] turns opaque becomes and highly pigmented, the [[hemolymph|haemolymph]] becomes milky white, and the animal appears [[wikt:moribund|moribund]].<ref name="Stentiford"/> Other parasites of ''N. norvegicus'' include the [[Gregarinasina|gregarine]] [[protozoa]]n ''[[Porospora nephropis]]'', the [[Trematoda|trematode]] ''[[Stichocotyle|Stichocotyle nephropis]]'' and the [[polychaete]] ''[[Histriobdella homari]]''.<ref name="Stentiford"/>

==Life cycle==
The typical [[longevity|life span]] of ''N.&nbsp;norvegicus'' is 5<U+2013>10 years,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marlin.ac.uk/reproduction.php?speciesID=3892 |title=Norway lobster - ''Nephrops norvegicus'' |work=Marine Life Information Network |publisher=[[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=February 14, 2011 |author=Marisa Sabatini & Jacqueline Hill |year=2008}}</ref> reaching 15 years in exceptional cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imr.no/om_havforskningsinstituttet/arrangementer/konferanser/icwl_bergen/lobster_research_at_imr_1/en |title=Lobster research at IMR |publisher=[[Norwegian Institute of Marine Research]] |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref> Its [[reproductive cycle]] varies depending on geographical position: "the periods of hatching and spawning, and the length of the incubation period, vary with latitude and the breeding cycle changes from annual to biennial as one moves from south to north".<ref name="Bell"/> Incubation of eggs is [[temperature]]-dependent, and in colder climates, the duration of the incubation period increases. This means that, by the time hatching occurs, it may be too late for the females to take part in that year's breeding cycle. In warmer climates, the combined effects of recovery from [[ecdysis|moulting]] and ovary maturation mean that spawning can become delayed. This, in turn, has the effect of the female missing out a year of egg carrying.<ref>{{cite book |author=N. Bailey |year=1984 |title=Some Aspects of Reproduction in ''Nephrops'' |publisher=[[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] |series=Shellfish Committee Document CM 1984/K:33 |page=16}}</ref>

Adult male ''Nephrops norvegicus'' [[ecdysis|moult]] once or twice a year (usually in late winter or spring) and adult females moult up to once a year (in late winter or spring, after hatching of the eggs).<ref name="Bell"/> In annual breeding cycles, mating takes place in the spring or winter, when the females are in the soft, post-moult state.<ref>{{cite book |author=A.

After spawning, the berried (egg-carrying) females return to their burrows and remain there until the end of the incubation period. Hatching takes place in early spring or late winter. Soon after hatching, the females moult and mate again.<ref name="Bell"/>
