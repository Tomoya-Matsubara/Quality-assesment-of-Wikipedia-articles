The Big Green Egg is the brand name of a [[Kamado|kamado]]-style ceramic charcoal cooker which is manufactured in a variety of sizes.

==History==
[[Image:Xl big green egg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Extra Large Big Green Egg]]
The Big Green Egg is commonly referred to as a [[kamado]] [[barbecue]] because of the origins of the basic design that lie in southern [[Japan]].

The word "mushikamado" means "steam cooker" (from "mushi" meaning "to steam", and "kamado" meaning "cooker, oven, or kiln")  The mushikamado was a device designed to [[Steaming|steam]] [[rice]] and used by Japanese families for ceremonial occasions and took the shape of a round [[clay]] [[pot]] with a removable [[domed]] clay lid. It was also distinctive in that it featured a top [[damper]] and bottom draft door for superior temperature control.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. The mushikamado first came to the attention of the Americans after World War II when [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] servicemen would bring them back from Japan in empty transport planes{{Fact|date=November 2007}}.  It wasn<U+2019>t until the late [[1960s]] that manufacturing started in the Americas. The Big Green Egg Company was founded in [[1974]] and is based in [[Tucker, Georgia|Tucker, Georgia]] in the [[United States|USA]]. Production of the Big Green Egg takes place in [[Mexico]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

==Technology==
The shape of the Egg reflects ancient technology in that it is designed to contain the heat with only a small [[vent]] at the top to create a [[draft]] to keep the fire going. Today<U+2019>s Egg is manufactured from high fiber [[ceramic]]s developed for the [[space shuttle program]] specifically designed to reflect heat and this allows temperatures of up to 1200 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] to be reached. The external surface has a high gloss ceramic glaze applied to provide crack and weather resistance.

==Fuel==
The Big Green Egg is a [[charcoal]] barbecue - the manufacturers recommend lump wood charcoal because alternatives such as charcoal briquettes contain many additives that can contaminate the flavour of the food. The sealed design of the grill results in a slow burn that uses small amounts of charcoal compared to a regular grill and lump wood charcoal also creates little ash.

==Uses==

Big Green Eggs can be used for smoking or [[grilling]] and with the addition of accessories one can also bake [[bread]] or cook a [[pizza]].<ref name="Boston Globe">{{cite web

==Grill parts==
In addition to the outer [[ceramic]] shell there is draft opening to provide air to the [[ceramic]] firebox in the base of the unit. There<U+2019>s a separate daisy wheel damper unit on the top to give air flow control and therefore temperature regulation. An accessory called a plate setter can be placed above the firebox - this will prevent direct cooking of the food when using the unit as a smoker. Between the base and the lid is a [[Felt|felt]] [[Gasket|gasket]] designed to maximise moisture retention during long cookouts.

== Eggheads ==
Big Green Egg barbecues have quite an enthusiastic following of amateur chefs and the collective name given these enthusiasts is <U+201C>Eggheads<U+201D><ref name="Boston Globe"/>. Every year there is a global gathering of Eggheads called <U+201C>Eggtoberfest<U+201D> where recipes are swapped and experiences passed along.
