The square was named for [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]], who visited Buffalo in 1825.<ref name=LSBNCVB/>

Today, the square offers a clear view of [[Buffalo City Hall]], an [[Art Deco]] building three blocks to the west.

The square once was surrounded by an iron fence that was no longer present by 1905.<ref>{{cite news|title=Passing of Old Building Recalls  Early Buffalo|date=1920-12-21|work=[[Buffalo Times]]}}</ref> By the 1860s, the square was a heavily wooded park.<ref name=F/> In 1876-7, trees that lined the square along main street were removed.<ref name=TPBoEB/><ref name=BA46-47>Kowsky, p. 46-47</ref>

Lafayette Square was the last park in the heart of the city, but the commercialization of the downtown area caused vehicular space demands.<ref name=BA46-47/> The original parklike square was originally viewed by [[urban planning|urban planners]] as an impediment to crosstown traffic.<ref name="BA88"/>    In 1912, the [[Buffalo Common Council]] authorized the extension of Broadway to Main Street through Lafayette Square, which reduced the size of the square "to devote to street purposes all that part of the Square except for a small circle around the Soldiers and Sailors Monument."<ref name=BA46-47/>  The square has since been redeveloped a few times and is now more of a thoroughfare than a park.<ref name="BA88"/>  In 1920, the square circumscribed a vehicular circle with the monument in the center surrounded by sidewalks and grass.<ref>Bisco, p. 59</ref>

===Monument===
The monument's shaft supports a {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m|1|adj=on}} female figure, and four {{convert|8|ft|m|1|adj=on}} bronze statues, representing the [[infantry]], [[artillery]], [[cavalry]] and [[navy]], sculpted by [[Caspar Buberl]], which face the four cardinal points.  Bronze bas-reliefs encircle the column above the statues.<ref name=39ALS/>  The female figure is an allegorical figure representing the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref name=F/>  By the time of the 1979 report for the Mayor's Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs, two plaques were missing from the monument.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Buffalo's Public Art|publisher=The Mayor's Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs|page=62|author=School of Architecture and Environmental Design, State University of New York at Buffalo|date=1979-12-20|postscript=.}}</ref>

The dedication on the west (Main Street) side honors those who laid down their lives "in the war to maintain the union for the cause of their country and of mankind." Half of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] graces the east side of the monument. Several [[bas-relief]] panels feature scenes of Lincoln's original [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]]: [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Salmon Chase]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H.

In 1848, the [[Free Soil Party]], which was absorbed into the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1854, held its national nominating convention in Buffalo.  A the convention, the party selected former [[New York Governor]] and former United States President [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] as their nominees for [[United States President]] and [[United States Vice President]] for the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 election]].<ref name=OPotNFSC>{{Cite book|title=Official Proceedings of the National Free Soil Convention, assembled at Buffalo, N.Y., August 9th and 10th, 1848|publisher=E.

The first meeting regarding the erection of a Civil War monument was held on April 14, 1866.  Efforts stalled until Mrs. [[Horatio Seymour]] organized the Ladies Union Monument Association on July 2, 1874, which raised $12,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12000|1874|r=0}}}}) and approved a design by [[George W.

Then-[[Mayor of Buffalo]] [[Grover Cleveland]] laid the cornerstone of Keller's {{convert|85|ft|m|1|adj=on}} [[granite]]-shaft ''Soldiers and Sailors'' monument in the center of the square on July 4, 1882 and returned as New York Governor to dedicate the monument July 4, 1884.<ref name=39ALS/><ref name=F/>  When the cornerstone was laid with military pomp and Masonic ritual, Cleveland spoke,<ref>Brown, p. 120</ref> and a [[time capsule]] was sealed away.<ref name=TS&SMiLSBNY>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffaloah.com/a/lafsq/index.html|title=The Soldiers & Sailors Monument in Lafayette Square Buffalo, New York|accessdate=2009-03-25|author=Maryniak, Benjamin R.}}</ref> In addition, [[Brigadier General]] [[Stewart Woodford]] made remarks at the first ceremony.<ref name=TS&SMiLSBNY/> Woodford was among several notable people who attended the dedication, including [[Pennsylvania Governor]] [[John Hartranft]] and Brigadier General [[William Findlay Rogers]].<ref name=TS&SMiLSBNY/>  Columns of [[Union Army]] veterans marched down Main Street to celebrate the day.<ref name=F/>

The monument has survived two significant threats.  First, in 1889, the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] was found to have settled unevenly, causing a dangerous tilt similar to that of the [[Tower of Pisa]].  The square was cracking and crumbling due to an inadequate core of rubble and mortar to support the granite shaft and statuary.  In addition the copper box time capsule was found to be three feet below its intended chamber and cracked with its contents destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preserve.bfn.org/bpr/june96/858main/index.html|title=The Old Curiosity Shop|accessdate=2009-03-25|author=Van Ness, Cynthia|work=Buffalo Preservation Report}}</ref>  The monument was dismantled and rebuilt with an expanded {{convert|15|ft|m|1|adj=on}} base.  On February 12, 1973, a motorist drove his vehicle into the monument,<ref name=TS&SMiLSBNY/> prompting calls for its demolition by 1982 by the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]].<ref name=TS&SMiLSBNY/>  Instead, the monument was repaired through fundraising efforts by the Buffalo Civil War Round Table involving a successful public awareness campaign.<ref name=TS&SMiLSBNY/>
