The '''Ulster Defence Union''' was a [[Irish Unionism|Unionist]] organization formed in 1893 to oppose the [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule movement]], following a rally at the [[Ulster Hall]], [[Belfast]]. Its principal aim was to resist the [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] of 1893. 

The UDU was launched by the publication of a manifesto on 17 March 1893, the signatories of which included [[Edward James Saunderson|Colonel Edward Saunderson, MP]].<ref>Alvin Jackson, ''Colonel Edward Saunderson: land and loyalty in Victorian Ireland'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmnJU-vk1hwC&pg=PA116#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 116]</ref> Shortly after its creation, it adopted the motto ''Quis Separabit?''

On 1 September 1893, the Second Home Rule Bill was passed by the House of Commons by 347 votes to 304, but when it came to the [[House of Lords]] it was heavily defeated, by 419 votes to only 41. By October 1893, the UDU had a Central Assembly described as comprising six hundred gentlemen, which first met on 24 October 1893, from among whom an executive committee of forty was elected.<ref>''Belfast Weekly News'' dated October 21, 1893, ''[http://ulster.failteromhat.com/defenceunion.htm Ulster Defence Union]'' online at failteromhat.com, accessed 12 April 2011</ref> This committee also included, ''[[ex officio]]'', the Ulster Unionist members of both [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|houses of parliament]].<ref name=folklife/> In October, 1893, at an Ulster Defence Union meeting in Belfast, Saunderson said, celebrating the scale of opposition in the Lords {{quote|Home Rule is dead. It was dissected in the House of Commons, buried in the House of Lords, and even the Irish people would not trouble to give it a wake.<ref>John Fitzsimons Harbinson, ''The Ulster Unionist Party, 1882-1973: its development and organisation'' (1973), p. 20</ref>}}

Eventually, in 1905, the organization took part in the formation of the [[Ulster Unionist Council]], which was a precursor of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]].
