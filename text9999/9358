'''El Greco''' (probably a combination of the [[Spanish language|Castilian]] and the [[Venetian language]] for "The [[Greeks|Greek]]",{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} [[1541]] &ndash; [[April 7]] [[1614]]) was a [[painting|painter]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], and [[architecture|architect]] of the [[Spanish Renaissance]]. He usually signed his paintings in [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] with his full name, '''Dom<U+00E9>nicos Theotoc<U+00F3>poulos''' ({{lang-el|''<U+0394><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0398><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>''}}), underscoring his Greek descent. 

El Greco was born in [[Crete]], which was at that time part of the [[Republic of Venice]]; at 26 he travelled to [[Venice]] itself to study, then a common practice of young Greek men who wished to pursue a wider education. In 1570 he moved to [[Rome]], where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in [[Italy]], El Greco enriched his style with elements of [[Mannerism]] and of the [[Italian Renaissance|Venetian Renaissance]]. In 1577 he emigrated to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]], where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best known paintings.

El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the [[20th century]]. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both [[Expressionism]] and [[Cubism]], while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.<ref name="Br">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greco, El|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=2002}}</ref> He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical [[pigmentation]], marrying [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] traditions with those of [[Western civilization]].<ref name="Plaka53">M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco&mdash;The Greek'', 60</ref>

{{details|Art of El Greco}}

===Technique and style===
 The primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco's style.<ref name="Plaka47-49" /> El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion. He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease.<ref name="Plaka47-49" />

|}
El Greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting, and declared that color had primacy over form.<ref name="Plaka47-49" /> [[Francisco Pacheco]], a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, wrote that the painter liked "the colors crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity" and that "he believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature".<ref name="Landon330">A. E. Landon, ''Reincarnation Magazine 1925'', 330</ref>

[[Image:The Spoliation - el greco.jpg|thumb|''[[The Disrobing of Christ]]'' ({{lang|es|''El Espolio''}}) (1577&ndash;1579, oil on canvas, 285&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;173&nbsp;cm, Sacristy of the Cathedral, Toledo) is one of the most famous [[altarpiece]]s of El Greco. El Greco's altarpieces are renowned for their dynamic compositions and startling innovations.]]

Art historian [[Max Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]] was the first scholar to connect El Greco's art with Mannerism and [[Antinaturalism]].<ref name="Lopera20">J.A. Lopera, ''El Greco: From Crete to Toledo'', 20&ndash;21</ref> Modern scholars characterize El Greco's theory as "typically Mannerist" and pinpoint its sources in the [[Neo-Platonism]] of the [[Renaissance]].<ref name="BrownMar">J. Brown, ''El Greco and Toledo'', 110<br>* F. Marias, ''El Greco's Aristic Thought'', 183&ndash;184</ref> Jonathan Brown believes that El Greco endeavored to create a sophisticated form of art;<ref name="Brown110">J. Brown, ''El Greco and Toledo'', 110</ref> according to [[Nicholas Penny]] "once in Spain, El Greco was able to create a style of his own &mdash; one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions of painting".<ref name="Penny">N. Penny, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n05/penn02_.html At the National Gallery]</ref>

In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe.<ref name="Br" /> The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style.<ref name="Landon330" /> El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces.<ref name="Lambraki57-59">M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco'', 57&ndash;59</ref> The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for ''The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception'' El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another 1.5 feet "because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure'". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne|C<U+00E9>zanne]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].<ref name="Lambraki57-59" />

Another characteristic of El Greco's mature style is the use of light. As Jonathan Brown notes, "each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source".<ref name="Brown136">J. Brown, ''El Greco and Toledo'', 136</ref> Fernando Marias and Agust<U+00ED>n Bustamante Garc<U+00ED>a, the scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo-Platonism.<ref>Marias-Bustamante, {{lang|es|''Las Ideas Art<U+00ED>sticas de El Greco''}}, 52</ref> 

[[Image:El Greco View of Toledo.jpg|thumb|left| ''View of Toledo'' (c. 1596&ndash;1600, oil on canvas, 47.75&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;42.75&nbsp;cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) is one of the two surviving landscapes of Toledo painted by El Greco.]]

Modern scholarly research emphasizes on the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style and stresses the painter's ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings.<ref name="Hatz89-133">N. Hadjinikolaou, ''Inequalities in the work of Theotoc<U+00F3>poulos'', 89&ndash;133</ref> [[Harold Wethey]] asserts that "although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish [[mysticism]]". He believes that in El Greco's mature works "the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter-Reformation".<ref name="Br" />

El Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a sitter's features but also to convey their character.<ref name="Metropolitan">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm El Greco]</ref> His portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings, but are of equally high quality. Wethey says that "by such simple means, the artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the highest rank as a portraitist, along with Titian and [[Rembrandt]]".<ref name="Br" />

===Suggested Byzantine affinities=== 
Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors,<ref name="PrBC">R. Byron, ''Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture'', 160&ndash;174<br>* A. Procopiou, ''El Greco and Cretan Painting'', 74</ref> while, others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.<ref name="Cossio">M.B Coss<U+00ED>o, ''El Greco'', 501&ndash;512</ref>

The discovery of the ''Dormition of the Virgin'' on [[Syros]], an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism.<ref name="Cormack">Cormack-Vassilaki, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAL/is_522_162/ai_n15950295/pg_1 The Baptism of Christ]</ref> Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art.<ref name="Helm93-94">R.M. Helm, ''The Neoplatonic Tradition in the Art of El Greco'', 93&ndash;94<br>* A.L. Mayer, ''El Greco&mdash;An Oriental Artist'', 146</ref> According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka "far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work".<ref name="LambrakiVima">M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco, the Puzzle'', 19</ref> In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with [[Oxford|Oxford University]] professors [[Cyril Mango]] and [[Elizabeth Jeffreys]], who assert that "despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his [[Works of El Greco|famous paintings]] was his signature in Greek lettering".<ref name="Mango">Mango-Jeffreys, ''Towards a Franco&mdash;Greek Culture'', 305</ref> Nicos Hadjinicolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is "neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but [[Western Europe]]an. The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the [[Art of Italy|Italian art]], and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art".<ref name="Hatz92">N. Hadjinikolaou, ''El Greco, 450 Years from his Birth'', 92</ref>

[[Image:Adoration of the Magi.jpg|thumb|''The Adoration of the Magi'' (1565&ndash;1567, 56&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;62&nbsp;cm, [[Benaki Museum]], [[Athens]]). The icon, signed by El Greco ("<U+03A7><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03C1> <U+0394><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C5>", Created by the hand of Dom<U+00E9>nicos), was painted in Candia on part of an old chest.]]

The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco's style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church. Davies believes that the religious climate of the Counter-Reformation and the aesthetics of mannerism acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique. He asserts that the philosophies of [[Platonism]] and ancient Neo-Platonism, the works of [[Plotinus]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style.<ref name="Davies20">D. Davies, "The Influence of Neo-Platonism on El Greco", 20 etc.<br>* D. Davies, ''the Byzantine Legacy in the Art of El Greco'', 425&ndash;445</ref> Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, Jos<U+00E9> <U+00C1>lvarez Lopera, curator at the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, concludes that the presence of "Byzantine memories" is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.<ref name="Lopera18-19">J.A. Lopera, ''El Greco: From Crete to Toledo'',  18&ndash;19</ref>

===Architecture and sculpture===
El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime.<ref name="Griffith">W. Griffith, ''Historic Shrines of Spain'', 184</ref> He usually designed complete altar compositions, working as architect and sculptor as well as painter &ndash; at, for instance, the Hospital de la Caridad. There he decorated the chapel of the hospital, but the wooden altar and the sculptures he created have in all probability perished.<ref name="Harris">E. Harris, ''A Decorative Scheme by El Greco'', 154</ref> For {{lang|es|''El Espolio''}} the master designed the original altar of [[gilding|gilded]] wood which has been destroyed, but his small sculptured group of the ''Miracle of St. Ildefonso'' still survives on the lower centre of the frame.<ref name="Br" />

| style="text-align: left;" | "I would not be happy to see a beautiful, well-proportioned woman, no matter from which point of view, however extravagant, not only lose her beauty in order to, I would say, increase in size according to the law of vision, but no longer appear beautiful, and, in fact, become monstrous."

|}
His most important architectural achievement was the church and Monastery of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, for which he also executed sculptures and paintings.<ref name="Allardyce">I. Allardyce, ''Historic Shrines of Spain'', 174</ref> El Greco is regarded as a painter who incorporated architecture in his painting.<ref name="Tzonis164">Lefaivre-Tzonis, ''The Emergence of Modern Architecture'', 164</ref> He is also credited with the architectural frames to his own paintings in Toledo. Pacheco characterized him as "a writer of painting, sculpture and architecture".<ref name="Plaka47-49" /> 

In the [[marginalia]] that El Greco inscribed in his copy of [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s translation of [[Vitruvius]]' {{lang|la|''[[De Architectura]]''}}, he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius's manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.<ref name="Tzonis164" />

El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early [[baroque]] style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism.<ref name="Br" /> El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers.<ref name="Plaka49">M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco&mdash;The Greek'', 49</ref> Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his [[Antinaturalism|antinaturalistic]] style and his complex [[iconography]]. Some of these commentators, such as [[Acislo Antonio Palomino de Castro y Velasco]] and [[Juan Agust<U+00ED>n Ce<U+00E1>n Berm<U+00FA>dez]], described his mature work as "contemptible", "ridiculous" and "worthy of scorn".<ref name="BrownFou">Brown-Mann, ''Spanish Paintings'', 43<br>* E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to C<U+00E9>zanne'', 100&ndash;101</ref> The views of Palomino and Berm<U+00FA>dez were frequently repeated in Spanish [[historiography]], adorned with terms such as "strange", "queer", "original", "eccentric" and "odd".<ref name="Foundoulaki100">E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to C<U+00E9>zanne'', 100&ndash;101</ref> The phrase "sunk in eccentricity", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into "madness".{{Ref_label|J|j|none}}

With the arrival of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew.<ref name="Plaka49" /> To French writer [[Theophile Gautier]], El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme.<ref name="Russel1">J. Russel, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DC1739F93BA25754C0A964948260 Seeing The Art Of El Greco As Never Before]</ref> Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the "gifted", the "misunderstood", the "mad"{{Ref_label|J|j|none}}), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique.<ref name="Foundoulaki100" /> French art critics [[Zacharie Astruc]] and [[Paul Lefort]] helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor.<ref name="Russel1" />
 
In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolom<U+00E9> Coss<U+00ED>o published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.<ref name="Brown43">Brown-Mann, ''Spanish Paintings'', 43<br>* E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to C<U+00E9>zanne'', 103</ref> The same year [[Julius Meier-Graefe]], a scholar of French [[Impressionism]], travelled in Spain and recorded his experiences in ''The Spanische Reise'', the first book which established El Greco as a great painter of the past. In El Greco's work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowing of modernity.<ref>J.J. Sheehan, ''Museums in the German Art World'', 150</ref> These are the words Meier-Graefe used to describe El Greco's impact on the [[art movement|artistic movements]] of his time:

<blockquote>He [El Greco] has discovered a realm of new possibilities. Not even he, himself, was able to exhaust them. All the generations that follow after him live in his realm. There is a greater difference between him and Titian, his master, than between him and Renoir or C<U+00E9>zanne. Nevertheless, Renoir and C<U+00E9>zanne are masters of impeccable originality because it is not possible to avail yourself of El Greco's language, if in using it, it is not invented again and again, by the user.<ref name="Meier458">J. Meier-Graefe, ''The Spanish Journey'', 458</ref></blockquote>

To the English artist and critic [[Roger Fry]] in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best "with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public". Fry described El Greco as "an [[Old Master|old master]] who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back to show us the way".<ref name="Kimmelman" /> During the same period, other researchers developed alternate, more radical theories. Doctors August Goldschmidt and Germ<U+00E1>n Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems (possibly progressive [[astigmatism]] or [[strabismus]]) that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular.{{Ref_label|K|k|none}} English writer [[W. Somerset Maugham]] attributed El Greco's personal style to the artist's "latent [[homosexuality]]", and doctor Arturo Perera to the use of [[marijuana]].<ref name="Tazartes68-69">M.

Michael Kimmelman, a reviewer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', stated that "to Greeks [El Greco] became the quintessential Greek painter; to the Spanish, the quintessential Spaniard".<ref name="Kimmelman" /> As was proved by the campaign of the National Art Gallery in Athens to raise the funds for the purchase of ''Saint Peter'' in 1995, El Greco is not loved just by experts and art lovers but also by ordinary people; thanks to the donations mainly of individuals and public benefit foundations the National Art Gallery raised 1.2 million dollars and purchased the painting.<ref name="Plaka59">M.

The early cubist explorations of Picasso were to uncover other aspects in the work of El Greco: structural analysis of his compositions, multi-faced refraction of form, interweaving of form and space, and special effects of highlights. Several traits of cubism, such as distortions and the materialistic rendering of time, have their analogies in El Greco's work. According to Picasso, El Greco's structure is cubist.<ref name="Souch<U+00E8>reFoun">E.

The expressionists focused on the expressive distortions of El Greco. According to [[Franz Marc]], one of the principal painters of the [[German Expressionism|German expressionist]] movement, "we refer with pleasure and with steadfastness to the case of El Greco, because the glory of this painter is closely tied to the evolution of our new perceptions on art".<ref name="Kandinsky75-76">Kandinsky-Marc, ''Blaue Reiter'', 75&ndash;76</ref> [[Jackson Pollock]], a major force in the [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] movement, was also influenced by El Greco.

Contemporary painters are also inspired by El Greco's art. [[Kysa Johnson]] used El Greco's paintings of the [[Immaculate Conception]] as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.<ref name="Harrison">H.A.

El Greco's personality and work were a source of inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke's poems (''Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II.'', 1913) was based directly on El Greco's ''Immaculate Conception''.<ref>F.

In [[1998 in music|1998]], the Greek electronic composer and artist [[Vangelis]] published ''[[El Greco (album)|El Greco]]'', a [[symphony|symphonic]] album inspired by the artist.

==Debates on attribution==
{{details|Works of El Greco}}

[[Image:The Modena Triptych.jpg|thumb|right|''The Modena Triptych'' (1568, tempera on panel, 37&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;23,8&nbsp;cm (central), 24&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;18&nbsp;cm (side panels), Galleria Estense, Modena) is a small-scale composition attributed to El Greco .]]

The exact number of El Greco's works has been a hotly contested issue. In 1937 a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco. Palluchini attributed to El Greco a small [[triptych]] in the Galleria Estense at [[Modena]] on the basis of a signature on the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych ("{{lang|el|<U+03A7><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03C1> <U+0394><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C5>}}", Created by the hand of Dom<U+00E9>nicos).<ref name="Tazartes25">M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 25</ref> There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore, Pallucchini's publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist.<ref name="Palluchini>R. Palluchini, ''Some Early Works by El Greco'', 130&ndash;135</ref> Nevertheless, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any connection at all with the artist and, in 1962, produced a reactive catalogue {{lang|fr|''raisonn<U+00E9>''}} with a greatly reduced corpus of materials. Whereas art historian Jos<U+00E9> Cam<U+00F3>n Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829 paintings to the Cretan master, Wethey reduced the number to 285 authentic works and Halldor S<U+0153>hner, a German researcher of [[Spanish art]], recognized only 137.<ref name="CormackTaz">Cormack-Vassilaki, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAL/is_522_162/ai_n15950295/pg_1 The Baptism of Christ]<br>* M.

The words El Greco used to sign his paintings. El Greco appended after his name the word "{{lang|el-Latn|epoia}}" ({{lang|el|<U+1F10><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}, "he made it"). In ''The Assumption'' the painter used the word "{{lang|el-Latn|deixas}}" ({{lang|el|<U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03BE><U+03B1><U+03C2>}}, "he displayed it") instead of "{{lang|el-Latn|epoia}}".]]

Since 1962 the discovery of the ''Dormition'' and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey's assessments were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco's origins, development and {{lang|fr|''oeuvre''}}. The discovery of the ''Dormition'' led to the attribution of three other signed works of "Dom<U+00E9>nicos" to El Greco (''Modena Triptych'', ''St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child'', and ''The Adoration of the Magi'') and then to the acceptance of more works as authentic &ndash;  some signed, some not (such as ''The Passion of Christ (Piet<U+00E0> with Angels)'' painted in 1566),<ref name="Alberge">D. Alberge, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2326011,00.html  Collector Is Vindicated as Icon is Hailed as El Greco]</ref> &ndash;  which were brought into the group of early works of El Greco. El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate the style of early El Greco, some painted while he was still in Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome.<ref name="Cormack" /> Even Wethey accepted that "he [El Greco] probably had painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete".<ref name="Wetheyar" /> Nevertheless, disputes over the exact number of El Greco's authentic works remain unresolved, and the status of Wethey's catalogue {{lang|fr|''raisonn<U+00E9>''}} is at the centre of these disagreements.<ref name="Mann102">R.G. Mann, ''Tradition and Originality in El Greco's Work'', 102</ref>

A few sculptures, including ''Epimetheus and Pandora'', have been attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models).<ref name="Web1"> [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/24/2405grec.html Epimetheus and Pandora], Web Gallery of Art<br>* X. de Salas, ''The Velazquez Exhibition in Madrid'', 54&ndash;57</ref> There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, ''The Crucifixion''.<ref name="Web2">[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,845903,00.html El Greco Drawings Could Fetch <U+00A3>400,000], The Guardian<br>* [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/23/index.html Study for St John the Evangelist and an Angel], Web Gallery of Art</ref>

'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} Theotoc<U+00F3>poulos acquired the name "El Greco" in Italy, where the custom of identifying a man by designating a country or city of origin was a common practice. The curious form of the article (''El'') may be from the Venetian dialect or more likely from the Spanish, though in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] his name would be "{{lang|es|El ''Griego''}}".<ref name="Br" /> The Cretan master was generally known in Italy and Spain as ''Dominico Greco'', and was called only after his death El Greco.<ref name="Cormack" />

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}} According to a contemporary, El Greco acquired his name, not only for his place of origin, but also for the sublimity of his art: "Out of the great esteem he was held in he was called the Greek (il Greco)" (comment of Giulio Cesare Mancini about El Greco in his ''Chronicles'', which were written a few years after El Greco's death).<ref name="Prevelakis47">P. Prevelakis, ''Theotoc<U+00F3>poulos&mdash;Biography'', 47</ref>

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}} There is an ongoing dispute about El Greco's birthplace. Most researchers and scholars give Candia as his birthplace.<ref name="PlTazSch">M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco&mdash;The Greek'', 40&ndash;41<br>* M. Scholz-Hansel, ''El Greco'', 7<br>* M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 23</ref> Nonetheless, according to Achileus A. Kyrou, a prominent Greek journalist of the 20th century, El Greco was born in Fodele and the ruins of his family's house are still extant in the place where old Fodele was (the village later changed location because of the raids of the pirates).<ref name="Helios" /> Candia's claim to him is based on two documents from a trial in 1606, when the painter was 65, stating his place of birth as Candia. Fodele natives argue that El Greco probably told everyone in Spain he was from Heraklion because it was the closest known city next to tiny Fodele<ref>J. Kakissis, [http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/2005/03/06/the_root_of_the_matter__el_greco/ A Cretan Village that was the Painter's Birthplace]</ref>

'''e.''' {{Note_label|E|e|none}} According to archival research in the late 1990s, El Greco was still in Candia at the age of twenty-six. It was there where his works, created in the spirit of the post-Byzantine painters of the Cretan School, were greatly esteemed. On  [[December 26]], [[1566]] El Greco sought permission from the Venetian authorities to sell a "panel of the Passion of Christ executed on a gold background" ("un quadro della Passione del Nostro Signor Giesu Christo, dorato") in a lottery.<ref name="Cormack" /> The Byzantine icon by young Dom<U+00E9>nicos depicting the ''Passion of Christ'', painted on a gold ground, was appraised and sold on [[December 27]] [[1566]] in Candia for the agreed price of seventy gold ducats (The panel was valued by two artists; one of them was icon-painter Georgios Klontzas. One valuation was eighty ducats and the other seventy), equal in value to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that period.<ref name="Constantoudaki71" />  Therefore, it seems that El Greco traveled to Venice sometime after December 27, 1566.<ref name="Sethre90">J.

'''g.''' {{Note_label|G|g|none}} Toledo must have been one of the largest cities in Europe during this period. In 1571 the population of the city was 62,000.<ref name="Plaka43-44" />

'''h.''' {{Note_label|H|h|none}}El Greco signed the contract for the decoration of the high altar of the church of the Hospital of Charity on [[June 18]], [[1603]]. He agreed to finish the work by August of the following year. Although such deadlines were seldom met, it was a point of potential conflict. He also agreed to allow the brotherhood to select the appraisers.<ref name="Engass205">Enggass-Brown, ''Italian and Spanish Art, 1600&ndash;1750'', 205</ref> The brotherhood took advantage of this act of good faith and did not wish to arrive at a fair settlement.<ref name="Fern<U+00E1>dez172-184">F. de S.R.

Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 56, 61</ref>

'''i.''' {{Note_label|I|i|none}}Do<U+00F1>a Jer<U+00F3>nima de Las Cuevas appears to have outlived El Greco, and, although the master acknowledged both her and his son, he never married her. That fact has puzzled researchers, because he mentioned her in various documents, including his last testament. Most analysts assume that El Greco had married unhappily in his youth and therefore could not legalize another attachment.<ref name="Br" />

'''j.''' {{Note_label|J|j|none}} The myth of El Greco's madness came in two versions. On the one hand Gautier believed that El Greco went mad from excessive artistic sensitivity.<ref>T. Gautier, {{lang|fr|''Voyage en Espagne''}}, 217</ref> On the other hand, the public and the critics would not possess the ideological criteria of Gautier and would retain the image of El Greco as a "mad painter" and, therefore, his "maddest" paintings were not admired but considered to be historical documents proving his "madness".<ref name="Foundoulaki100" />

'''k.''' {{Note_label|K|k|none}} This theory enjoyed surprising popularity during the early years of the twentieth century and was opposed by the German [[psychologist]] David Kuntz.<ref name="HelmTe93-94">R.M. Helm, ''The Neoplatonic Tradition in the Art of El Greco'', 93&ndash;94<br>* M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 68&ndash;69</ref>. Whether or not El Greco had progressive astigmatism is still open to debate.<ref name="Grierson">I. Grierson, ''The Eye Book'', 115</ref> Stuart Anstis, Professor at the [[University of California]] (Department of Psychology), concludes that "even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life, would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic expression, not a visual symptom."<ref>S. Anstis, ''Was El Greco Astigmatic'', 208</ref> According to Professor of Spanish John Armstrong Crow, "astigmatism could never give quality to a canvas, nor talent to a dunce".<ref name="Crow">J.A.
