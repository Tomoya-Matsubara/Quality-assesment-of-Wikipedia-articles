'''''Scream in Blue (Live)''''' is a live concert [[album]] by [[Midnight Oil]] that was released in 1992 under the [[Columbia Records]] label.  It contains songs carefully culled from 5 live concerts recorded over a 9 year period.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Scream-Blue-Midnight-Oil/dp/B0000028OQ Amazon.com: Scream in Blue: Midnight Oil: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The audiences sound quite large, but also included is material from a 1990 protest concert held on the street in front of Exxon headquarters in New York City.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/scream-in-blue-live-r59613/review Scream in Blue Live - Midnight Oil | AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The album is mixed so as to sound like one continuous concert.

The album starts with a scathing, nearly atonal electric guitar solo and never lets up (until the final, more subdued studio bonus track ''Burnie''), careening through a hooky hard-rock minefield of clever, socially conscious lyrics sung with passion over a rip-roaring but very tight band.<ref>[http://www.epinions.com/review/musc_mu-125674/content_343906422404 Scorching Live Anthems from Australian Rockers - Scream In Blue: Live by Midnight Oil - Epinions.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The tracks were evidently recorded through the sound systems of the various concerts, then mixed to a clear and well-balanced sound in the style of audio verit<U+00E9>.  Also, at the end of ''Only the Strong'', a short sound sample is inserted containing some chanting by unidentified American Indians<ref name=autogenerated1 /> which also sounds passionately rendered, although jarringly out of context.
