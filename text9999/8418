The '''James River''' in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]] is a {{convert|410|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[river]], including its Jackson River source. It drains a [[Drainage basin|catchment]] comprising {{convert|10432|sqmi|km2}}. The watershed includes about 4% open water and an area with a population of 2.5 million people (2000). It is the 12th longest river in the [[United States]] that remains entirely within a single state.

==Course==
The James River forms in the [[Allegheny Mountains]], near [[Iron Gate, Virginia|Iron Gate]] on the border between [[Alleghany County, Virginia|Alleghany]] and [[Botetourt County, Virginia|Botetourt]] counties from the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[Cowpasture River|Cowpasture]] and [[Jackson River (Virginia)|Jackson River]]s, and flows into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] at [[Hampton Roads]]. Tidal waters extend west to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], the capital of Virginia, at its [[fall line]] (the [[head of navigation]]). Larger tributaries draining to the tidal portion include the [[Appomattox River]], [[Chickahominy River]], [[Warwick River]], [[Pagan River]], and the [[Nansemond River]]. 

At its mouth near Newport News Point, the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] and the [[Nansemond River]] join the James River to form the harbor area known as [[Hampton Roads]]. Between the tip of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] near [[Old Point Comfort]] and the [[Willoughby Spit]] area of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] in [[South Hampton Roads]], a channel leads from Hampton Roads into the southern portion of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and out to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] a few miles further east.

==History==
The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who populated the area east of the [[fall line]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries called the James River the '''Powhatan River''', named for the chief of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] which extended over most of the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]]. The English colonists named it "James" after King [[James I of England]], as they also constructed the first permanent [[English colonization of the Americas|English settlement in the Americas]] in 1607 at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] along the banks of the James River about {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

The navigable portion of the river was the major highway of the [[Colony of Virginia]] during its first 15 years, facilitating supply ships delivering supplies and more people from England. However, for the first five years, despite many hopes of gold and riches, these ships sent little of monetary value back to the sponsors. In 1612, businessman [[John Rolfe]] successfully cultivated a non-native strain of [[tobacco]] which proved popular in England. Soon, the river became the primary means of exporting the large [[hogshead]]s of this [[cash crop]] from an ever-growing number of [[plantation]]s with wharfs along its banks. This development made the proprietary efforts of the [[Virginia Company of London]] successful financially, spurring even more development, investments and immigration. Below the falls at Richmond, many [[James River plantations]] had their own wharfs, and additional ports and/or early railheads were located at [[Warwick, Virginia (Chesterfield County)|Warwick]], [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]], [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]], [[Claremont, Virginia|Claremont]], [[Scotland, Virginia|Scotland]], and [[Smithfield, Virginia|Smithfield]], and, during the 17th century, the capital of the Colony at Jamestown. 
     
Navigation of the James River played an important role in early Virginia commerce and the settlement of the interior, although growth of the colony was primarily in the Tidewater regions during the first 75 years. The upper reaches of the river above the head of navigation at the fall line were explored by fur trading parties sent by [[Abraham Wood]] during the late 17th century. 

Although ocean-going ships could not navigate past present-day [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], portage of products and navigation with smaller craft to transport crops other than tobacco was feasible. Produce from the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and [[Great Appalachian Valley|Great Valley]] regions traveled down the river to seaports at Richmond and [[Manchester, Virginia|Manchester]] through such port towns as [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], [[Scottsville, Virginia|Scottsville]], [[Columbia, Virginia|Columbia]] and  [[Buchanan, Virginia|Buchanan]].   

===James River and Kanawha Canal===
The James River was also considered as a route for transport of produce from the [[Ohio Valley]]. The [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] was built for this purpose, to provide a navigable portion of the [[Kanawha River]], a tributary of the [[Ohio River]]. For the most mountainous section between the two points, the [[James River and Kanawha Turnpike]] was built to provide a portage link via wagons and stagecoaches. However, before the canal could be fully completed, in the mid-19th century, [[railroad]]s emerged as a more practical technology and eclipsed [[canal]]s for economical transportation. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) was completed between Richmond and the Ohio River at the new city of [[Huntington, West Virginia]] by 1873, dooming the canal's economic prospects. In the 1880s, the [[Richmond and Allegheny Railroad]] was laid along the eastern portion of the canal's towpath, and became part of the C&O within 10 years. In modern times, this rail line serves as a water-level route of [[CSX Transportation]], used primarily in transporting [[West Virginia]] coal to export [[coal pier]]s at [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].

==Recreation==
The James River also contains numerous parks and other recreational attractions.  Canoeing, fishing, kayaking, hiking, and swimming are some of the activities that people enjoy along the river during the summer.  From the river's start in the [[Blue Ridge mountains]] to [[Richmond, Virginia]], numerous rapids and pools offer fishing and whitewater rafting.  The most intense whitewater stretch is a two mile (3 km) segment that ends in downtown Richmond where the river goes over the fall line.  This is the only place in the country where extensive class III (class IV with above average river levels) whitewater conditions exist within sight of skyscrapers.  Below the [[Fall Line]] east of Richmond, the river is better suited for water skiing and other large boat recreation. Here the river is known for its blue catfish, reaching average sizes of 20 to 30 pounds, with frequent catches exceeding 50 pounds.  In the Chesapeake watershed, the James River is the last confirmed holdout for the nearly extirpated [[Atlantic sturgeon]].  In May 2007 a survey identified 175 sturgeon remaining in the entire river, with 15 specimens exceeding five feet.<ref> Karl Blankenship, Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, "Bay Journal", Sept. 2007, p. 7 </ref>

==Bridges==
{{main|List of crossings of the James River (Virginia)}}

===Highway bridges below Richmond===
In the [[Hampton Roads]] area, the river is as much as five miles (8 km) wide at points. Due to ocean-going shipping upriver as far as the [[Port of Richmond]], a combination of [[ferryboat]]s, high [[bridge]]s and [[bridge-tunnel]]s are used for highway traffic. Crossings  east to west include:

*The [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] ([[Interstate 64 (Virginia)|I-64]])
*The [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]] ([[Interstate 664|I-664]])
*The [[James River Bridge]]([[US Route 17|US 17]]/ [[US 258]]/ [[Virginia State Route 32|VA 32]])
*The [[Jamestown Ferry]] ([[Virginia State Route 31|VA 31]]) (toll-free)  
*The [[Benjamin Harrison Bridge]] near Hopewell. This is a [[drawbridge]] on [[State Route 156 (Virginia)|State Route 156]] which replaced ferry service in 1966. It was the site of major collision of a ship in 1977. 
*The [[Varina-Enon Bridge]] is a high [[cable-stayed bridge]] carrying [[Interstate 295 (Virginia)|I-295]] which was the second of its type in the U.S. when it was completed.
*The [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge (Richmond)|Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge]] carries the [[Pocahontas Parkway]] ([[State Route 895 (Virginia)|State Route 895]]) via a high-level bridge to connect to [[State Route 151 (Virginia)|State Route 151]] at [[Interstate 95 (Virginia)|Interstate 95]]. 

The SR 895 high level crossing is the last bridge east of the Deepwater Port of Richmond and head of ocean-going navigation at the [[fall line]] of the James River. West of this point, potential flooding is more of an engineering concern than clearance for watercraft.

===Highway bridges at Richmond===
The following is a list of extant highway bridges across the James River with one or both ends within the City of Richmond river. 

* [[Interstate 95 James River Bridge]] ([[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]])
* [[Mayo Bridge]] (US-360)
* [[Manchester Bridge (Virginia)|Manchester Bridge]] (US-60)
* [[Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge]] (US-1 and US-301)
* [[Boulevard Bridge]] (VA-161) (toll bridge, restricted weights)
* [[Powhite Parkway Bridge]] ([[Powhite Parkway]] and VA-76) (toll bridge)
* [[Huguenot Bridge]] (VA-147)
* [[Edward E. Willey Memorial Bridge]] (VA-150)

===Highway bridges west of Richmond===
The following is a partial, incomplete list of extant highway bridges across the James River west of Richmond. 

* [[World War II Veterans Memorial Bridge (Virginia)|World War II Veterans Memorial Bridge]] (VA-288) 
* [[U.S. Route 522]] near [[Maidens, Virginia]]
* [[Route 45 (Virginia)|State Route 45]] near [[Cartersville, Virginia]]
* Columbia Road (Route 690) near [[Columbia, Virginia]]
* [[U.S. Route 15]] near Bremo Bluff, Virginia
* [[Route 20 (Virginia)|State Route 20]] near [[Scottsville, Virginia]]
* State Route 56 near Wingina, Virginia 
* [[Monacan Bridge]] ([[U.S. Route 29]] East of [[Lynchburg, Virginia]])
* [[Carter Glass Memorial Bridge]] ([[U.S. Route 29 Business]] at [[Lynchburg, Virginia]])
* [[John Lynch Memorial Bridge]] ([[Lynchburg, Virginia]])

===Bicycles===
The [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]] prohibit bicycles, but bicyclists may take the [[Jamestown Ferry]].<ref>[http://www.virginiadot.org/infoservice/bk-info.asp]{{dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref>  After a fatal accident on the [[Boulevard Bridge]], the City of Richmond requires bicycles to travel on the sidewalk for the length of the bridge.
