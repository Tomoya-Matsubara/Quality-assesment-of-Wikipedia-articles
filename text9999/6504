==History==
{{Main|History of Vladivostok}}

Vladivostok was part of China before Russia acquired the entire Maritime Province including the island of Sakhalin by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] (1858) when China, which had just lost the Opium War with Britain, was unable to act. The Pacific coast near Vladivostok was settled mainly by the [[Chinese]], [[Jurchens|Jurchen]], [[Manchus|Manchu]] and [[Koreans|Korean]] during Imperial Chinese Qing dynasty period. A French whaler visiting the [[Zolotoy Rog]] in 1852 discovered Chinese or Manchu villege fishermen  on the shore of the bay.

The naval outpost was founded in 1859 by Count [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]], who named it after the model of [[Vladikavkaz]], a Russian fortress in the [[Caucasus]]. The first child was born in Vladivostok in 1863. An elaborate system of fortifications was erected between the 1870s and 1890s. A telegraph line from Vladivostok to [[Shanghai]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] was opened in 1871, the year when a commercial port was relocated to this town from [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur]]. The municipal coat of arms, representing the [[Siberian tiger]], was adopted in March 1883.

The city's economy was given a boost in 1903, with the completion of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] which connected Vladivostok to [[Moscow]] and Europe. The first [[high school]] was opened in 1899. In the wake of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], Vladivostok was of great military importance for the [[Far Eastern Republic]], the [[Provisional Priamurye Government]], and the [[Siberian Intervention|Allied intervention]], consisting of foreign troops from Japan, the [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia|United States]], [[Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force|Canada]], Czechoslovakia, and other lands.<ref>[http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/h1x40w1535233070/fulltext.pdf Benjamin Isitt, "Mutiny from Victoria to Vladivostok, December 1918," ''Canadian Historical Review'', 87:2 (June 2006)]</ref> The taking of the city by [[Ieronim Uborevich]]'s [[Red Army]] on [[25 October]] [[1922]] marked the end of the [[Russian Civil War]].

As the main naval base of the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]], the city was closed to foreigners during the Soviet years. Nevertheless, it was at Vladivostok that [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Gerald Ford]] conducted the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] in 1974.  At the time, the two countries decided quantitative limits on various [[nuclear weapons]] systems and banned the construction of new land-based [[ICBM]] launchers.

==Geography==
The city is located in the southern extremity of [[Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula]], which is about 30&nbsp;km long and approximately 12&nbsp;km wide.

The highest point is [[Mount Kholodilnik]], the height of which is 257&nbsp;m.  [[Eagle's Nest Mount]] is often called the highest point of the city; however, with the height of only 199&nbsp;m (214&nbsp;m according to other sources), it is the highest point of the downtown area, but not of the whole city.

Vladivostok shares the latitude with [[Sapporo]], [[Sukhumi]], [[Almaty]], [[Florence]], [[Marseille]], [[A Coru<U+00F1>a]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and [[Toronto]].

Railroad distance to [[Moscow]] is 9,302&nbsp;km.  The direct distance to Moscow is 6,430&nbsp;km.  Direct distance to [[Bangkok]] is 5,600&nbsp;km, to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]<U+2014>6,180&nbsp;km, [[San Francisco]]<U+2014>8,400&nbsp;km, [[Lisbon]]<U+2014>10,100&nbsp;km, [[London]]<U+2014>8,500&nbsp;km, to [[Seoul]]<U+2014>750&nbsp;km, to [[Tokyo]]<U+2014>1,050&nbsp;km, to [[Beijing]]<U+2014>1,331&nbsp;km.

The city's population was 594,701 as of the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]]; down from 633,838 recorded in the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 Census]]. Ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]] make up the majority of the population.

From 1958 to 1991, only Soviet citizens were allowed to live in or even visit Vladivostok (and even Soviet citizens had to obtain official permission in order to enter the city). Before this [[closed city|closure]], the city had large [[Koryo-saram|Korean]]<ref>[http://www.vladmission.org/russianparishes/Vladivostok/vladivostok.htm Most Holy Mother of God, Vladivostok]</ref> and Chinese populations.<ref>[http://www.f8.com/FP/Russia/Avlad.html Vladivostok]</ref> Some [[Korea]]ns who were deported during [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] rule from the Russian Far East have since returned, particularly to Vladivostok.<ref>[http://vlad.tribnet.com/1997/iss149/focus.htm Coming home]</ref> 

Vladivostok has one of the largest [[Armenians|Armenian]] communities in eastern Russia. There are a number of Armenian [[bakeries]] and [[restaurants]] in the city. There are also sizable communities of [[Chechens]], [[Azeris]] and [[Tajiks]] in the city.<ref>[http://www.asiapacificms.com/articles/vladivostok_terror/ Russian Far East: Crime Central]</ref> According to the latest statistics, there are currently about 100,000 [[Islam in Russia|Muslims]] living in the [[Russian Far East]].<ref>[http://vn.vladnews.ru/issue546/Social_life/Mosque_and_chapel_to_preach_tolerance Mosque and chapel to preach tolerance&nbsp;<U+2013> Vladivostok News]</ref>

==Economy==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=February 2008}}

The city's main industries are [[shipping]], commercial [[fishing]], and the [[naval base]]. Fishing accounts for almost four-fifths of Vladivostok's commercial production. Other food production totals 11%.

The main export items were [[fish]], [[timber]] products, [[ferrous metal|ferrous]] and [[non-ferrous metal]]s, and [[ship]]s. The main import items were food products, [[medicine]], [[clothing]], [[footwear]], [[automobile]]s, household technical items, and ships.

Since the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], many businesses have opened offices in Vladivostok, taking advantage of its location on the [[Pacific Ocean]] and in [[East Asia]].

==Transport==
[[Image:VladivostokStation.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Vladivostok railway station]]

The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was built to connect [[European Russia]] with Vladivostok, Russia's most important [[Pacific Ocean]] port. Finished in 1905, the rail line ran from Moscow to Vladivostok via several of Russia's main cities. Part of the railroad, known as the [[Chinese Eastern Line]], crossed over into [[Manchuria]], [[China]], passing through [[Harbin]], a major city in Manchuria.

Air routes connect [[Vladivostok International Airport]] with
Japan, [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]] and [[Vietnam]].
It is possible to get to Vladivostok from several of the larger cities in Russia.  Regular flights to [[Seattle, Washington]] were available in the 1990s but have been canceled since. [[Vladivostok Air]] resumed flying to Anchorage in July 2008. They had previously been available in the 1990s.

===Urban transport===
[[Image:Vladivostok tram.JPG|right|thumb|Vladivostok tram]]
On [[28 June]] [[1908]], Vladivostok's first tram line was started along Svetlanskaya Street from the railway station in Lugovaya Street.  On [[9 October]] [[1912]], the first wooden cars manufactured in Belgium entered service. Today, Vladivostok's means of public transportation include trolleybus, bus, tram, train, funicular, ferryboat and cutter. The main urban traffic lines are City Center<U+2014>Vtoraya Rechka, City Center<U+2014>Balyayeva, and City Center<U+2014>Lugovaya Street.

==Media==
Over fifty [[newspaper]]s and regional additions to Moscow publications are issued in Vladivostok. The largest newspaper of the [[Primorsky Krai]] and the whole [[Russian Far East]] is ''Vladivostok'' with a circulation of 124,000 copies at the beginning of 1996. Its founder, joint-stock company Vladivostok-News, also issues a weekly English-language newspaper ''[http://vn.vladnews.ru/ Vladivostok News]''. Another source of information on the city is the online daily [http://www.vladivostoktimes.com/ Vladivostok Times]. The subjects of the publications issued in these newspapers vary from information around Vladivostok and Primorye to major international events. Newspaper ''Zolotoy Rog'' (''Golden Horn'') gives every detail of economic news. Entertainment materials and cultural news constitute a larger part of Novosti (News) newspaper which is the most popular among Primorye's young people.

As of 2006, there are fourteen channels broadcasting. They are [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]], [[RTR]], [[OTV-Prim]], [[Rambler (TV)|Rambler]], [[STS (Russian television network)|STS]], [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], [[MTV Russia]], [[Muz-TV]], [[Kultura (TV)|Kultura]], [[Ren-TV]], [[NTV Russia|NTV]], [[DTV Viasat]].

As of 1999, there are also seven radio stations, the most popular being 24-hour VBC (612 kHz, 101.7 MHz) and Europa+ (738 kHz, 104.2 MHz). Europa+ normally broadcasts popular modern British-American music, while the ratio of Russian and foreign songs over VBC is fifty-fifty. Every hour one can hear local news over these radio stations. Radio Vladivostok (1098 kHz) operates from 06:00 till 01:00. It broadcasts several special programs which are devoted to the music of the 1950s-1980s as well as [[New Age music|New Age]].

Arguably Russia's most famous rock band, [[Mumiy Troll]] (<U+041C><U+0443><U+043C><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0422><U+0440><U+043E><U+043B><U+043B><U+044C>), hails from Vladivostok and frequently puts on shows there. In addition, the city played host to the now-legendary "[[VladiROCKstok]]" International Music Festival in September 1996.  Hosted by the Mayor and Governor, and organized by two young American expatriates, the festival drew nearly 10,000 people and top-tier musical acts from St. Petersburg ([[Akvarium]] and [[DDT (band)]]) and Seattle (Supersuckers), as well as several leading local bands. {{Fact|date=March 2008}}

It is the nearest city to the massive [[Sikhote-Alin Meteorite]], which fell on [[February 12]], [[1947]], in the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, approximately 440&nbsp;km northeast of Vladivostok.

==Pollution==

Two thirds of Vladivostok's suburbs are so [[pollution|polluted]] that living in them is classified as a health hazard, according to the local ecological specialists, ''Ecocenter''. Some areas, such as those near the printing works in Pokrovsky Park and the [[Far Eastern National University]] campus, are so polluted that they are defined as ecological disaster zones. Only a few areas have permissible levels of contamination. Professor Boris Preobrazhensky, a top ecologist at the Pacific Institute of Geography said that there was nowhere in the area that was really healthy to live in.

The ''Ecocenter'' report has taken ten years to compile and is believed to be the most comprehensive of its kind. It was based on analysis of over 30,000 samples of water, snow, soil, air and human tissues taken between 1985 and 1993. Samples showed significant rises over that period in the levels of heavy metals, such as [[cadmium]], [[zirconium]], [[cobalt]], [[arsenic]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which severely affect the respiratory and nervous systems.

The pollution has a number of causes, according to ''Ecocenter'' geo-chemical expert Sergey Shlykov. Vladivostok has about 80 industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as shipbuilding and repairing, power stations, printing, fur farming and mining. In addition, Vladivostok has a particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of the pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.<ref name="Ecocenter">B.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Preobrazhensky, A.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Burago, S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Shlykov.

==Sport==
Vladivostok is home to the football club [[FC Luch-Energiya Vladivostok]], who play in the [[Russian Premier League]], and basketball club [[Spartak Primorje]], who play in the [[Russian Basketball Super League]].
