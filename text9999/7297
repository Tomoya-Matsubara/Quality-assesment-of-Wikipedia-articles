He is the former [[BAMMA#World Title history|BAMMA Middleweight Champion]], the former [[UCMMA|UCMMA Middleweight Champion]], and has also competed for [[Cage Rage Championships|Cage Rage]] and the [[Maximum Fighting Championship|MFC]].

==Mixed martial arts career==

===Background===
Watson began training when he was 16 years old and has an extensive [[boxing]] background, winning two awards, Amateur Boxing Standout 2006, a three-time ABA Southern Counties Champion, and Full Contact Unlicensed Boxing Champion.<ref name=UFC/> 

===Cage Rage and early career===
Watson held a 1-0-1 amateur record before going pro in 2006. He won his first two fights and was then given the chance to fight in the UK's top MMA promotion, [[Cage Rage Championships|Cage Rage]]. His first fight was against [[Daijiro Matsui]] in February 2007 at Cage Rage 20, and he lost via an [[armbar]] in the first round. He returned to the cage a month later and impressively defeated Dorlan O'Malley via KO after a slam.

After this, he was given another chance against a higher profile opponent. He took on UFC veteran Xavier Foupa-Pokam at ''CageRage 21: Judgement Day'' in April, 2007, but was submitted again. He fought a further two times that year, and recorded a win and a loss. In 2008, he began to climb the ladder again by beating Pierre Guillet and John Phillips, but Cage Rage went into liquidation and he then went to [[Ultimate Challenge MMA]].

===Ultimate Challenge MMA===
Watson's first Ultimate Challenge MMA bout came against Daniel Cubitt at ''Ultimate Challenge UK: Bad Breed'' in December 2008. He won the fight by knocking his opponent out less than two minutes into the first round to win the inaugural Ultimate Challenge UK title. He returned at ''Ultimate Challenge UK: Dynamite'' in October 2009 to take on [[Denniston Sutherland]], and defeated him via split decision.

===Maximum Fighting Championship===
On 10 January 2010, Watson signed a three fight deal with the [[Maximum Fighting Championship]], a Canadian promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtheoctagon.com/?p=3077 |title=Maximum Fighting Championship signs Tom <U+2018>Kong<U+2019> Watson |publisher=Aroundtheoctagon.com |date=2010-01-13 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> His first fight was on 26 February 2010, where he took on Travis Galbraith on ''[[MFC 24|MFC 24: Heat XC]]''. In the second minute of the first round, Kong knocked his opponent out with a vicious right head kick. This won him knockout of the night and put him at the top of the list for knockout of the year.

His second fight for the Canadian promotion took place on the main card of [[MFC 26]] card against [[Jesse Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.maximumfighting.com/articles/2010/jul/26.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> Watson lost via unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28) after being deducted a point for repeatedly grabbing the ropes.

===BAMMA===
On June 27, 2009, Watson fought at the [[BAMMA|British Association of Mixed Martial Arts]]' first event, ''[[BAMMA 1|BAMMA 1: The Fighting Premiership]]'', after a hard fought battle, Watson defeated [[John Maguire (fighter)|John Maguire]] via TKO at 2:47 of round 3. It was confirmed that Maguire had broken his arm during the fight after a takedown.

He was then scheduled to fight [[Celebrity Big Brother 2010 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]] winner [[Alex Reid (MMA)|Alex Reid]] for the vacant Middleweight Championship at ''[[BAMMA 3]]'' in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bamma.net/?q=node/5 |title=Alex Reid vs Tom Watson |publisher=Bamma.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> However, Reid injured his knee while filming his documentary TV series ''Alex Reid: The Fight of His Life'' and was forced to pull out of the fight. This angered Watson, who claimed Reid was disrespecting him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/379797-alex-reid-pulls-out-of-controversial-title-fight-with-tom-watson |title=Alex Reid Pulls Out of Controversial Title Fight with Tom Watson |publisher=Bleacherreport.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> Watson also called him a "clown" and said that it was likely Reid pulled out to avoid an embarrassing defeat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/celebrity-big-brother/cage-fighter-tom-%E2%80%9Ckong%E2%80%9D-watson-calls-alex-reid-a-clown/ |title=Cage fighter Tom "Kong" Watson calls Alex Reid <U+2018>a clown<U+2019> |publisher=Unrealitytv.co.uk |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> Reid was then replaced by UFC and IFL veteran [[Matt Horwich]]. After miraculously freeing himself from a rear-naked choke in the first round, Watson went on to dominate the fight with his superior striking and won via unanimous decision (48-47, 49-47, 49-46) to become the first BAMMA Middleweight Champion.<ref>{{cite web|author=BAMMA 3 - Full Review |url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/wrestling-wwe-ufc-mma/2010/05/bamma-3---full-review.html |title=BAMMA 3 - Full Review |publisher=Blogs.mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>

Initially, Watson maintained that he did not want to waste any more time training for and fighting such a low-level opponent as Reid<ref name="mirror1">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/wrestling-wwe-ufc-mma/uk-news/ |title=BAMMA: Reid v Watson WILL happen, but not at BAMMA 3 |publisher=Blogs.mirror.co.uk |date=2011-04-02 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> but the Reid vs. Watson fight was rescheduled for ''[[BAMMA 4]]'' on 25 September 2010.<ref name="mirror1"/> Watson won by unanimous decision, as the judges scored the fight 49-46 49-46 49-47.<ref>http://www.bamma.net/index.php/schedule/event-results/bamma-4.html</ref>

On 21 May 2011, he faced former [[Elite Xtreme Combat#EliteXC Champions|EliteXC Middleweight Champion]] [[Murilo Rua]] at [[Wembley Arena]] in London, England, defeating the PRIDE FC veteran by KO due to head kick followed up by punches in the third round, and defending his BAMMA Middleweight Title in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2011/05/22/bamma-6-results-tom-watson-retires-murilo-ninja-rua/ |title=BAMMA 6 Results: Tom Watson Retires Murilo 'Ninja' Rua |publisher=Mmafighting.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>

Watson was set to fight former UFC [[Welterweight (MMA)|Welterweight]] contender and current BAMMA Middleweight, [[Frank Trigg]], for Kong's BAMMA Middleweight Title. However, Tom has suffered a back injury and was replaced by [[Jim Wallhead]].

Watson defended his title at [[BAMMA 9]] against BAMMA British Middleweight Champion [[Jack Marshman]], winning via TKO in the second round.<ref>{{ cite web| url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/serving-paratrooper-jack-marshman-gets-679566 | title=Serving paratrooper Jack Marshman gets BAMMA world title shot | last=Head | first=Simon | publisher= mirror.co.uk | date=February 9, 2012| accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>
