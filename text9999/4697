'''Camak House''', at 279 Meigs Street, [[Athens, Georgia]], was built in about 1834 by [[James Camak]]<ref name="gainfo">{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/Camak_House.htm|title=Camak House|work=GeorgiaInfo|publisher=[[Digital Library of Georgia]]|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name="marsh">{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Kenneth Frederick|last2=Marsh|first2=Blanche|title=Athens: Georgia's Columned City|year=1964|publisher=Cherokee Publishing Company|location=Atlanta|isbn=0-87797-048-3|pages=28<U+2013>29|chapter=James Camak House Masonic Temple}}</ref> and featured in Georgia's early railroad history. An example of [[Federal architecture]], it has a number of features unusual for its period, including a kitchen within the raised basement and [[closet]]s. Both main floors have four rooms; the stairwell has a mahogany railing, and moldings and trim were made using a Greek key pattern. After long service as a family home, it was used as a Masonic Lodge before being bought by Coca-Cola Enterprises. In 1975 Camak House was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], but the building had by then fallen into disrepair. It was restored and used as the offices of a law firm. As of December 2011, it is for sale. <ref name="sale">http://athens.patch.com/articles/historic-landmark-for-sale</ref>

==Architecture and early history==

Built atop a hill,<ref name="neal" /> Camak House was the first dwelling constructed on Prince Avenue; Meigs Street was added later, cutting off a portion of the original property.<ref name="gainfo" />  The architecture is [[Federal architecture|Federal style]],<ref name="marsh" /> "relatively unusual in Athens",<ref name="neal" /> with locally produced [[ironwork]] in the front.<ref name="marsh" /> The [[fanlight]] of the central doorway and the [[white-washed]] brick construction are typical elements of the style.<ref name="gainfo"/> The house has two stories, with a "four-over-four room, central hall plan"<ref name="gainfo" /> <U+2013> a style "based on the standard Greek Revival floor plan"<ref name="marshall" /> with a "raised basement, a low-hipped roof, and two-story pilasters".<ref name="gainfo" />  The basement originally housed slave quarters and the kitchen; the hazard of fire made it unusual for houses of the period to include a kitchen, but because of Camak House's brick construction the risk was thought to be low.<ref name="neal">{{cite journal|last=Neal|first=Patrick|date=April 1996|title=Camak House: Victory for Preservation|journal=Athens Magazine|pages=72<U+2013>81|issn=1053-623X}}</ref>

The floors were constructed using "knot-free heart-pine", and solid mahogany was used for the railing of the stairwell.<ref name="neal" /> Details include silver-plated doorknobs, "hand-forged locks and latches", and "a simple but visually striking Greek key pattern" for moldings and trim.<ref name="neal" /> Camak House was built with closets <U+2013> a very unusual feature for the time.<ref name="neal" />

Camak House was the location for a meeting to organize what became "the first successful railroad company in Georgia and only the third such company in the United States".<ref name="neal" /> James Camak was named president of the company, and later served as the first president of Georgia Railroad Bank.<ref name="neal" /> 

Five generations<ref name="marsh" /> of Camaks lived in the house until 1947.<ref name="lfg" /> In her book ''Historic Houses of Athens'', Charlotte Thomas Marshall notes that "It was not until 1904, eleven years after Dr. Camak's [son of the James Camak who built the house] death, that the first deed relating to the Camak house lot was recorded. At that time his sons, Louis and James Wellborn Camak, executed a quitclaim deed to their mother, Mary Wellborn Camak, acknowledging that the lot has been given to her by their father without a deed being made."<ref name="marshall">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Charlotte Thomas|title=Historic Houses of Athens|year=1987|publisher=Athens Historical Society|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=0935265155|pages=5<U+2013>7|chapter=Camak House}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A [[quitclaim deed|quitclaim ]] is a legal instrument by which the owner of a property terminates (quits) his right and claim to the property, thereby allowing his claim to transfer to another.|group=nb}} In 1949, the house was purchased to serve as the Mount Vernon Lodge No. 22, F. & A. M (Masonic lodge); then in 1979 by the Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Company.<ref name="gainfo" />

==Restoration and current use==
Albert Sams was president of the Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Company when it acquired Camak House.<ref name="neal" /> He "was an active member of the Athens-Clarke Heritage Foundation and a generous philanthropist, particularly with regard to historic houses", and he planned to renovate Camak House for administrative offices; corporate mergers (ultimately with [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]]) in the 1980s ended those plans.<ref name="neal" /> However, it was the Sams family that sought Camak House's listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="cheatham">{{cite book|last=Cheatham|first=Mike|title="Your friendly neighbor": the story of Georgia's Coca-Cola bottling families|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-U0f0iChoUcC&lpg=PA89&dq=Camak%20House&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q=Camak%20House&f=false|accessdate=May 18, 2011|year=1999|publisher=[[The Atlanta History Center]]|location=Atlanta|isbn=0-86554-686-X|page=89}}</ref>

The house and grounds had fallen into decay by 1993, when the [[Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation]] and the law firm of Winburn, Lewis and Barrow formed a partnership to purchase Camak House from Coca-Cola Enterprises.<ref name="neal" /> The trust added protective [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] before selling the property on to the law firm, one of whose partners was [[John Barrow (U.S. politician)|John Barrow]], who served as the "prime mover in these negotiations".<ref name="neal" />  A local company, S&W Development Corp, whose owner, Smith Wilson had been working in historic preservation for 18 years, was contracted to carry out the restoration work.<ref name="neal" /> The original floor plans, which had been altered during the Masons' tenure, were reinstated;<ref name="neal" />  Wilson was able to use drawings made of Camak House during the 1930s as part of the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s documentation of historic buildings.<ref name="neal" />

The house's restoration for use as law offices has been described by Elizabeth Dalton of the Athens-Clarke Heritage Foundation as "an excellent example of adaptive use".<ref name="neal" />  As of 2011, Camak House is owned by the law firm of Lewis, Frierson and Grayson, LLP.<ref name="lfg">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewisfrierson.com/home|title=About the Camak House|last=Lewis, Frierson & Grayson, LLP|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref>

==Historic status==

Camak House was listed as a "point of interest" in the WPA Guide to Georgia (which characterized the architecture as [[Georgian Colonial]]).<ref name="wpa">{{cite book|last=Georgia Writers' Project|first=|title=Georgia: a guide to its towns and countryside|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pn8268VQCJMC&lpg=PA156&dq=Camak%20House&pg=PA156#v=onepage&q=Camak%20House&f=false|accessdate=May 22, 2011|series=American Guide Series|year=1940|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|page=156}}</ref> The Athens Historical Society dedicated a historical marker on the grounds in 1963.<ref name="neal" /> The [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] documented Camak House (GA-14-67);<ref>{{cite book|last=Linley|first=John|title=The Georgia catalog, Historic American Buildings Survey: a guide to the architecture of the state|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_W1J2IvQn0oC&lpg=PA149&dq=Camak%20House&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q=Camak%20House&f=false|accessdate=May 22, 2011|year=1982|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|isbn=0-8203-0613-4|page=149}}</ref> on July 7, 1975, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]; on March 6, 1990, it was locally designated a Historic Landmark; and recognized by the Georgia Historical Marker Program (029<U+2013>10).<ref name="gainfo" />
