[[Interstate 15]] (abbreviated '''I-15''') runs north-south {{mi to km|287.26}} through [[Southern California]]. It is a major thoroughfare for traffic between [[Southern California]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. It is also the main route for traffic between [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]].

==Route description==
'''I-15''''s state (and national) southern terminus is [[Interstate 8|I-8]] in San Diego. From I-8, it runs north through [[Escondido, California|Escondido]] in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], passing [[MCAS Miramar]]. The highway passes through hilly terrain and [[avocado]] farmland before entering [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]] near the rapidly-growing community of [[Temecula, California|Temecula]].  In [[Murrieta, California|Murieta]], '''I-15''' splits from its first (and only) spur route in California, [[Interstate 215 (California)|I-215]], which runs through the two largest cities in the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]: [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] and [[Riverside, California|Riverside]]. '''I-15''' runs along the eastern edge of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]], passing the community of [[Lake Elsinore, California|Lake Elsinore]].  The freeway continues through the [[suburb]]an areas in the western Inland Empire, passing [[Corona, California|Corona]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]].  The highway then heads northward and upward through [[Cajon Pass]], a historic pass for travelers heading to Los Angeles from the north and east.  North of the pass, '''I-15''' traverses the [[Mojave Desert]] cities of [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] and [[Victorville, California|Victorville]].  The freeway passes through mostly unspoiled desert for {{mi to km|30}} before reaching [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], the last city '''I-15''' passes through in California.  The only other settlement '''I-15''' passes through in its final {{mi to km|108}} is [[Baker, California|Baker]], known as the "Gateway to [[Death Valley]]" and is home to the world's largest thermometer. The sign for the [[Zzyzx, California|Zzyzx]] exit, the alphabetically last place name in the United States, is a well-known landmark along the drive from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] on I-15.{{fact|date=July 2007}} '''I-15''' leaves California near the gambling town [[Primm, Nevada]] (formerly Stateline, Nevada).

==History==
[[Image:US 66.svg|left|70px]]
'''I-15''' was initially planned to run from I-10 in San Bernardino along the current I-215 alignment then up through the Cajon Pass and on to Las Vegas. California successfully argued the addition south to San Diego, suggesting that the freeway would connect the major military bases [[March Air Reserve Base|former March AFB]] and [[MCAS Miramar|former NAS Miramar]]. [[U.S. Route 395|US-395]] was then signed TEMP-15 and the "old" '''I-15''' between [[Devore, California|Devore]] and San Bernardino became I-215.

'''I-15''' replaced [[U.S. Route 395|US-395]] between San Diego and Temecula. The highway replaced [[U.S. Route 66|US-66]] between San Bernardino and Barstow. '''I-15''' north of Barstow replaced [[U.S. Route 91|US-91]].

==I-15 Express Lanes==
{{sect-stub}}
The '''[[I-15 Express Lanes]]''' are [[High-occupancy toll|high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes]] located in the median of Interstate 15 between [[California State Route 163]] and [[California State Route 56]] in San Diego.

==Future aspirations==
===I-15 Major Improvements Project===

Most of Interstate 15 is undergoing major improvements from Devore to the Nevada State Line, beginning in 2002, costing $349 million. This project will improve traffic flow on the heavily traveled highway for those going to and from Las Vegas. Most of the construction will be completed by Winter 2009. {{Fact|date=August 2007}} Projects include:

* Adding truck lanes on hills (39 miles at various locations)
* Repave 76 miles of I-15 at various locations
* Renovate and rehabilitate the rest area between [[Baker, CA|Baker]] and the Nevada State Line (Valley Wells Rest Area)
* Reconstructing bridges in [[Baker, CA|Baker]]
* Move the agriculture inspection station from Yermo to the Nevada State Line and include a truck weigh station

===Devore 2 Project===
Since August 14, 2006, the Devore Interchange (I-15 and I-215) have undergone a $26 million project to replace deteriorating roadway on the outer lanes in both directions on I-15. Also, a 3-mile truck climbing lane will be added on the northbound I-15 from the I-15/I-215 interchange. The project was completed on January 8, 2007.

==Names==
'''I-15''' carries several names as it passes through California.  Between [[Interstate 5|I-5]] and [[Interstate 805|I-805]] (a future part of '''I-15''', now signed as [[State Route 15 (California)|SR-15]] because several off-ramps and on-ramps are not built to [[Interstate Standards]]), the freeway is known simply as Wabash, most likely because its route runs along the old route of Wabash Street in San Diego.<ref name="CaHi">http://www.cahighways.org/009-016.html#015 Last accessed July 26, 2006.</ref>  Route 15 between I-805 and SR-91 is officially known as [[Escondido Freeway]].<ref name="CaHi" /> The stretch of '''I-15''' in San Diego County north of [[State Route 163 (California)|SR-163]] is known also as the "Cabrillo Freeway". '''I-15''' between SR-163 and Miramar Road is known as the Semper Fi Highway in recognition of the nearby MCAS Miramar.<ref name="CaHi"> Between the San Diego/Riverside County Line and Bundy Canyon Road, the freeway is named the Temecula Valley Freeway. '''I-15''' between the southern interchange with I-215 and SR-91 is named the "Corona Freeway". Between Limonite Avenue and the northern I-215 junction is named the "Ontario Freeway". North of the northern I-215 interchange, the '''15''' is known as the "Mojave Freeway" through the Nevada State Line.</ref>

In California, I-15 has at least five different names throughout its length.  From its southern terminus to the [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]]-[[San Diego County, California|San Diego]] county line, it is named the [[Escondido Freeway]].  The portion of the Escondido Freeway passing through the [[MCAS Miramar|Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar]] is also known as the Semper Fi Highway. From the San Diego county line to [[State Route 74 (California)|California 74]] (Ortega Highway) in [[Lake Elsinore, California|Lake Elsinore]], it is named the [[Temecula Valley Freeway]].  From CA 74 to Limonite Avenue in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], it is known as the [[Corona Freeway]]. From Limonite Avenue to the northern junction with the I-215 spur in Devore, it is called the [[Ontario Freeway]].  From the I-215 junction to the [[Interstate 40]] junction in Barstow, it is named the [[Barstow Freeway]].  Finally, from Barstow to the Nevada state line it is named the [[Mojave Freeway]].

==Major cities==
Bolded cities are officially-designated [[control cities]] for signs.<ref>[http://users.adelphia.net/~pwolf/controlcities.html List of Control Cities for Use in Guide Signs on Interstate Highways]</ref>
*'''[[San Diego, California|San Diego]]'''
*[[Escondido, California|Escondido]]
*[[Temecula, California|Temecula]]
*[[Ontario, California|Ontario]]
*[[Victorville, California|Victorville]]
*'''[[Barstow, California|Barstow]]'''
*'''[[Las Vegas, Nevada]]'''

Although the following cities do not lie along '''I-15''', they are listed as control cities for usage on '''I-15'''
*'''[[Riverside, California|Riverside]]'''
*'''[[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]'''
*'''[[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]'''

==State law==
'''Legal Definition of Route 15:''' [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/California_Streets_and_Highways_Code%2C_Chapter_2%2C_Article_3%2C_Section_301-635#Route_15 California Streets and Highways Code, Chapter 2, Article 3, Section 315] 
{{CAScenicAlt|shield=I-blank.gif|route=15|sec=263.3}}

==Exit list==
The list of exits on Interstate 15 are from south to north.  Note, [[as of 2006]], [[California]] is still in the process of numbering freeway exits; many still have not been numbered yet.  Also, the route of I-15 officially continues south from [[Interstate 8]] to [[Interstate 5]]; however, it is signed as [[California State Route 15|CA-15]] instead.  For purposes of continuity, this list starts at the official start of I-15 as an Interstate highway, at I-8.

There are a total of 400 exits along the entire I-15.

Postmiles are derived from<ref name="bridge log">[http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/structur/strmaint/brlog2.htm January 1, 2006 California Log of Bridges on State Highways]</ref> and exit numbers derived from<ref>[[Cal-NExUS]] [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/signtech/calnexus/index.htm Interchange Exit Numbering]</ref>.
