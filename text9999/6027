Their name is based around 80's cult 'beat em up' game [[Double Dragon]] Their musical style is described as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] which features twin [[guitar]] [[harmonies]], prominent guitar solos with clean and screaming vocals

== Band History ==

Double Dragon were formed in late 2004 when Screwface 13 guitarist Matthew 'Roady' Johnston left the band to create a new project that focused more on melody than the down-tuned stylings of 90's [[nu metal]]. After recruiting Danial Busch on drums, and bass player Jason Moon  the three piece began writing before recruiting singer Shane Christford and lead guitarist Ben Murphy who also played for bands High End Audio and Three Chain Break.

After recording a two track demo, due to personal differences Shane left the band, Double Dragon then recruited ex The Undamynd / Smiling Politely vocalist Lee Gardiner and proceeded to record their first EP titled Have Them Destroyed.

After touring nationally around the country and selling out their first CD launch, the band was set too continue writing and recording, when in 2005 singer Lee Gardiner was seriously injured in a domestic house fire, suffering third degree burns to both thighs and hands. During his rehabilitation period, Double Dragon had begun writing heavier, more aggressive songs, some of which are based around Lee's injuries and the impact it had on the band as a whole. Double Dragon were then signed by Adelaide based record label Truth Inc Records and went on to record their national debut, Scars Of Fire, produced by Ian Miller, in which it received critical acclaim throughout [[Australia]].

Following the success of their debut, Double Dragon were now a headline Australian metal act, which gave them the opportunity to support international bands such as [[Slayer]] , [[Arch Enemy]] , [[Dark Tranquillity]] , Katakylsm , [[The Black Dahlia Murder]], [[Cephalic Carnage]], [[Mastodon]] and the band also played to a reported 3000 people at the 2007 [[Big Day Out]].

Double Dragon also have received extensive airplay on [[JJJ]] [[Full Metal Racket]], with track "Beneath The City Of Churches" used in the background music for radio adverts promoting the show, and have also had their debut film clip for "Dead But Still Killing" appearing on music programs [[Rage]] and [[Channel V]]. Double Dragon were also part of the [[V Energy]] promotions on Channel V to coincide with their performance at the 2007 [[Big Day Out]]. 

Double Dragon then proceeded working on their debut album, titled [[Devastator]], also released through Truth Inc Records in 2008, which debut at number 1 on the SAMIA Adelaide charts. The band also received a nomination for 'Best Metal Act' in the dB magazine polls. After again receiving great reviews from the Australian metal media the band continued to tour until lead guitarist [[Ben Murphy]] left the band for personal reasons. He was replaced by 'A Red Dawn' guitarist [[Davin Buttery]]. Devastator also has a song [[Breathing Fire]] which has additional vocal parts by [[Brisbane]] singer / songwriter [[Emma Dean]]. In 2008 Double Dragon was the main support on Australian tours for [[Swedish people|Swedish]] bands [[The Haunted]], [[Soilwork]] and [[Carcass]] from the [[UK]].

In 2009 Double Dragon have been published in [[Blunt]] magazines "25 Australian bands to watch in 2009".

Lee Gardiner along side Truth Corroded vocalist Jason North are the founders and event managers for Australian metal fest Against The Grain, held in [[Adelaide]] annually.
