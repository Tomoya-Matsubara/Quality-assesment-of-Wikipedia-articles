The ''French ironclad '''Couronne''''' ("Crown") was the first iron-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] [[ironclad warship]] built for the [[French Navy]] in 1859<U+2013>62. She was the first such ship to be [[Keel|laid down]], although the British [[armoured frigate]] {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}} was completed first. The ship participated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870<U+2013>71, but saw no combat. She was served as a gunnery [[training ship]] from 1885 to 1908 before she was [[Hulk (ship)|hulked]] the following year and became a [[barracks ship]] in [[Toulon]]. ''Couronne'' was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1934, over 70 years after she was completed.

==Design and description==
Designed by the French [[naval architect]] Camille Audenet as an iron-hulled version of the {{sclass-|Gloire|ironclad}}s, ''Couronne'' was also intended to fight in the line of battle, unlike the first British ironclads.<ref>Gardiner, p. 54</ref> The ship was classified as an [[armoured frigate]]s because she only had a single gun deck and her traditional disposition of guns arrayed along the length of the hull also meant that she was a [[broadside ironclad]].<ref name=g1/> The ship was {{convert|80.85|m|ftin}} long,<ref name=g7>Gille, p. 23</ref> with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17|m|ftin}}. She had a maximum [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|7.8|m|ftin}}, a [[Glossary of nautical terms#D|depth of hold]] of {{convert|9.7|m|ftin}} and displaced {{convert|6428|t|LT}}.<ref name=g7/> The ship's [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|6|ft|m|1|disp=flip}} meant that she [[Ship motions|rolled]] less and was a better sea boat than the ''Gloire''s.<ref name=g1>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 286</ref> Her [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] were slightly higher above the [[waterline]] than those of her predecessors, {{convert|2|m|ftin}}, and ''Couronne'' took aboard less water as well.<ref name=d24/> She had a crew of 570 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=g7/>

The ship had a single [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return connecting-rod compound steam engine]] that drove a six-bladed, {{convert|5.8|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} propeller using steam provided by eight Indret oval [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s for a designed speed of {{convert|12.5|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=g7/> Figures for the engine's designed power vary wildly, from {{convert|2000|to|3200|ihp|lk=in}},<ref name=g7/><ref name=d24>de Balincourt & Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac, Part II, p. 24</ref><ref name=s1>Silverstone, p. 61</ref> but ''Couronne'' reached {{convert|13|kn}} from {{convert|2597|PS|lk=in}} during her [[sea trial]]s. She carried a maximum of {{convert|675|t|LT}} of coal<ref name=g7/> which allowed her to steam for {{convert|2410|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=s1/> The details of ''Couronne''{{'}}s sailing rig are not precisely known, but presumably she was fitted with a light [[barquentine]] rig with three masts like that of the ''Gloire''-class ships. It is also unknown if she had the same multiple changes of rigging as those ships.<ref>de Balincourt & Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac, Part I, p. 14</ref>

''Couronne'' was armed with 36 Mod<U+00E8>le 1860 {{convert|164.7|mm|in|adj=on|1}} [[rifled breech loader|rifled breech-loading guns]], 30 of which were positioned on the single gun deck in the [[broadside]]. The remaining 4 guns were placed on the upper deck as [[chase gun]]s.<ref name=g7/> They fired a {{convert|44.9|kg|lb|1|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of only {{convert|322|m/s|ft/s}} and proved to be ineffective against armour.<ref>Gardiner, p. 159</ref> The ship was rearmed multiple times during her career, the first of which was the replacement of the chase guns by four {{convert|220|mm|in|adj=on|1}} [[howitzer]]s in 1864 and the replacement of the rest of the guns by improved Mod<U+00E8>le 1864 guns. The ship was subsequently rearmed with 16 Mod<U+00E8>le 1864 or 1866 {{convert|194|mm|in|adj=on|1}} guns on her main deck and six 164.7-millimetre guns on the upper deck as chase guns. Her final armament configuration before she became a gunnery training ship in 1881 was eight {{convert|240|mm|in|adj=on|1}} Mod<U+00E8>le 1870 guns and four 194-millimetre Mod<U+00E8>le 1870 guns on the main deck. A pair of {{convert|120|mm|in|1|adj=on}} guns and a dozen {{convert|37|mm|adj=on|1}} 5-barrelled [[Hotchkiss revolving cannon]] were mounted on the upper deck.<ref name=g1/> 

''Couronne''{{'}}s [[wrought iron]] hull was completely protected by armour plates 120 millimetres thick. The armour backing consisted of two layers of [[teak]], totaling {{convert|15|in|mm|disp=flip}} in thickness, an iron lattice work {{convert|1.3|in|mm|disp=flip}} thick, and the {{convert|20|mm|adj=on}} side of the hull. The ship had a [[conning tower]] with armour {{convert|100|mm|in|1}} thick and {{convert|12.7|mm|in|1}} of armour underneath the wooden upper deck.<ref name=g1/>

== Construction and service ==
[[Image:La-Couronne-Bougault.jpg|thumb|left|A lithograph postcard of  ''Couronne'' sailing in heavy seas]]
Ordered on 4 March 1858,<ref name=g1/> ''Couronne'' was [[Keel|laid down]] at the [[Lorient|Arsenal de Lorient]] on 14 February 1859, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 28 April 1861 and commissioned on 2 February 1862 at a cost of 6,018,885 [[French franc|francs]].<ref name=d24/> On 19 June 1864, ''Couronne'' played an incidental role in the [[Battle of Cherbourg (1864)|Battle of Cherbourg]] as she escorted the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[commerce raider]] {{Ship|CSS|Alabama}} out of French territorial waters to her fight with {{USS|Kearsarge|1861|6}}.<ref>Luraghi, p. 319</ref> While assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|Mediterranean Fleet]], the ship made a port visit in August 1865 to [[Brest, France|Brest]] where the fleet hosted the British [[Channel Fleet]]. A few days later the French fleet made a reciprocal visit to [[Portsmouth]] where it was hosted by the Channel Fleet.<ref>Jones, pp. 35, 37</ref>

During the Franco-Prussian War the ship was assigned to [[Vice Admiral]] [[L<U+00E9>on Martin Fourichon]]'s squadron that [[blockade]]d German ports in the [[Heligoland Bight]] in August and September 1870.<ref>Wilson, vol. 1, pp. 275<U+2013>76</ref> The four German ironclads at [[Wilhelmshaven]] [[sortie]]d in search of the French squadron in early August before the French arrived and in mid-September<ref>Sondhaus, p. 102</ref> after the French were forced to abandon the blockade for lack of coal.<ref>Wilson, vol. 1, p. 276</ref> ''Couronne'' returned to Toulon on 10 December. In 1876, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. From 1881 to 1885, ''Couronne'' was reconstructed to serve as a gunnery training ship: her armour was replaced by wood of the same thickness, two boilers were removed and her propeller was replaced. Her rigging was replaced by a full [[ship rig]] and iron [[spar deck]] and [[poop deck]]s were fitted which gave her the appearance of a steam [[ship of the line]] of the {{Ship|French ship|Napol<U+00E9>on|1850|2}} type. The ship was rearmed with an assortment of guns of various calibres for training purposes. Her crew and trainees numbered 1200 officers and enlisted men. ''Couronne'' was replaced as a gunnery training ship on 1 December 1908 and disarmed on 1 September 1909.<ref name=d24/> She was subsequently converted to a floating barracks at Toulon until she was scrapped in 1934.<ref name=s1/>
