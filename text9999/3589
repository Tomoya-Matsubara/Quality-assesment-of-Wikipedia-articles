'''''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men''''' constituted five volumes of [[Dionysius Lardner|Dionysius Lardner<U+2019>s]] 133-volume ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' (1829&ndash;46). Written during the literary revolution that encouraged wider swaths of the populace to read, this encyclopedia appealed to the self-educating middle class. 

The ''Lives'' were part of the ''Cabinet of Biography'' in the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia''. The three-volume ''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal'' (1835&ndash;37) and the two-volume ''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France'' (1838&ndash;39) cover biographies of important fourteenth- to eighteenth-century writers and thinkers. They were largely written by the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writer [[Mary Shelley]]. Shelley's biographies reveal her to be a professional woman of letters who contracted to produce several volumes of works and was paid well to do so. Her extensive knowledge of history and languages, her ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the burgeoning field of [[feminist]] [[historiography]] are all reflected in these works. 

At times Shelley had trouble finding sufficient research materials and had to make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the ''Spanish and Portuguese Lives''. She wrote in a style that combined her secondary sources, [[memoir]] and anecdote, as well as her opinion. For example, her political views are most obvious in the ''Italian Lives'', where she supports the [[Italian unification|Italian independence movement]] and promotes [[republicanism]]. In the ''French Lives'' Shelley makes a particular effort to portray women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions, and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.

The ''Lives'' did not attract enough critical attention to become a bestseller. A fair number were still printed and sold, however; far more copies of the ''Lives'' circulated than of Shelley's novels, for example. Some of the volumes were pirated in the United States and praised by the poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Not reprinted until 2002, Mary Shelley's biographies have not been appreciated until recently.

==Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia''==
[[Image:LardnerCabinetCyclopaediaTitle.jpg|left|thumb|Title page from one volume of Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'', [[John Herschel|J. F. W. Herschel's]] ''A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'']]

During the first quarter of the nineteenth century, self-improvement literature became an important portion of the book market; "it was the age of the 'Family Library' edition".<ref>Crook, xix.</ref> In his article on the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'', Morse Peckham writes, this "revolution in literacy, [was] partly the result of the spread of liberal ideas by the French Revolution, [and] partly of the desire to combat those ideas by teaching the poor to read the Bible and religious tracts, [it] was to have an effect on modern society almost as profound as the industrial and agricultural revolutions".<ref>Peckham, 38.</ref> [[Dionysius Lardner|Dionysius Lardner's]] ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'', published between 1829 and 1846, was one of the most successful of these enterprises, which also included [[John Murray|John Murray<U+2019>s]] ''Family Library'' and the publications of the [[Society for the Propagation of Useful Knowledge]].<ref>Crook, xix; Kucich, "Biographer", 227; Peckham, 37.</ref> Although intended for the "general reader", the series was specifically for the middle-class rather than the masses. Each volume cost six [[shilling]]s, prohibiting purchase by the poor.<ref>Crook, xx; Kucich, "Biographer", 235; Peckham, 42.</ref> The advertisements for the ''Cyclopaedia'' describe the expected audience as "merchants, captains, families, [and] new-married couples".<ref>Qtd. in Kucich, "Biographer", 235.</ref> 

The series was divided into five "Cabinets": Arts and Manufactures, Biography, History, Natural History, and Natural Philosophy. The advertisement claimed these covered "all the usual divisions of knowledge that are not of a technical and professional kind".<ref>Qtd. in Crook, xx; see also Kucich, "Biographer", 227.</ref> Unlike other encyclopedias at the time, Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' arranged its articles topically rather than alphabetically.<ref>Peckham, 40.</ref> The prospectus assured its readers "nothing will be admitted into the pages of the 'CABINET CYCLOPAEDIA' which can have the most remote tendency to offend public or private morals. To enforce the cultivation of religion and the practice of virtue should be a principal object with all who undertake to inform the public mind."<ref>Qtd. in Peckham, 41.</ref> The series eventually contained 61 titles in 133 volumes and customers could purchase the entire set, a single cabinet, or a single volume.<ref>Crook, xx; Peckham, 37.</ref> The first volume was published in December 1829 by [[Longman]], Reese, Orme, Browne, Greene, and [[John Taylor (1781-1864)|John Taylor]].<ref>Crook, xx.</ref> Thirty-eight identified authors contributed (others are unidentified);<ref>Peckham, 37.</ref> [[Mary Shelley]] was the only female contributor and the eighth most productive.<ref>Crook, xx.</ref>

Revered Dr. Dionysius Lardner, a science lecturer at [[London University]], started the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' in 1827 or 1828.<ref>Peckham, 40.</ref> The authors who contributed to the volumes spanned the political spectrum and included many luminaries of the day. [[James Mackintosh]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Thomas Moore]], and [[Connop Thirlwall]] wrote histories; [[Robert Southey]] wrote naval biographies; [[Henry Roscoe]] wrote legal biographies; [[John Herschel]] wrote on astronomy and the philosophy of science; [[Augustus de Morgan|August de Morgan]] wrote on mathematics; David Brewster wrote on optics; and Lardner himself wrote on mathematics and physics.<ref>Peckham, 43-44.</ref> Authors were paid about <U+20A4>200 for each volume; however, some of the contracts were disproportionately high or low. For example, Irish poet Thomas Moore was contracted to write a two-volume ''History of Ireland'' in two years for <U+20A4>1,500.<ref>Crook, xxiv, note a.</ref> The overall project may have run into difficulty because it overpaid well-known writers.<ref>Crook, xxiv.</ref> Moreover, many of the famous writers listed in the original prospectus never participated. Peckham speculates that this was because of the project's financial problems. The 19 substitute contributors were, he writes, "at the time and subsequently a far less distinguished group than Lardner had originally announced".<ref>Peckham, 47.</ref>

The books were relatively expensive to print, due to the Corbould and Finden illustrations, images for the scientific volumes, and the use of [[Eyre & Spottiswoode, Ltd.|Spottiswoode's]] printing house.<ref>Crook, xxv.</ref> In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins.<ref>Crook, xxv.</ref> Four thousand copies of the first edition of the early volumes were probably printed, but the print run would have fallen to 2,500 as the sales did not pick up after 1835.<ref>Crook, xxv.</ref> As it became clear that the series was not going to take off, less publicity was undertaken: fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller.<ref>Crook, xxv.</ref> Lardner himself may also have become less interested in the project, as he stopped signing the business ledger after the middle of 1838.<ref>Crook, xxv.</ref> However, some volumes of the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' remained in print until 1890.<ref>Crook, xxvi.</ref>

Because of the popularity of encyclopedias at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' did not receive enough critical attention to make it a bestseller. Often the reviews were "perfunctory".<ref>Crook, xxv.</ref> However, some of the individual writers received attention. Moore, for example, was given a front page spread in the ''Literary Gazette'' for his history of Ireland.<ref>Crook, xxiv-v.</ref> Shelley<U+2019>s volumes received twelve reviews in total&mdash;a good number&mdash;but "her name was never fully exploited" in the project, whether by her choice or Lardner<U+2019>s is unclear.<ref>Crook, xxv.</ref> However, Peckham writes that "the ''Cyclopaedia'' on the whole was a distinguished and valuable work" and some of the individual volumes became famous.<ref>Peckham, 48.</ref>

==Mary Shelley<U+2019>s contributions==
[[Image:MaryShelley.jpg.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Mary Shelley]] wrote in her biography of [[Machiavelli]] that "there is no more delightful literary task than the justifying of a hero or writer, who has been misrepresented or reviled".<ref>Qtd. in Crook, xxviii.</ref> ([[Richard Rothwell]], 1839-40)]]

Writen during the "last truly creative decade of her life, the 1830s",<ref>Morrison, 129.</ref> [[Mary Shelley|Mary Shelley's]] contributions constitute about three-quarters of the five volumes of the ''Lives''.<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 227.</ref> Her biographies reveal her to be a professional woman of letters;<ref>Orr, "Introduction", xxxix.</ref> they also reveal her extensive knowledge, "manifested in her prodigious research across several centuries and in multiple languages", her ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the "emerging forms of feminist historiography".<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 228.</ref> She "wrote with many books to hand &ndash; reading (or rereading) some, consulting others, cross-referring, interweaving abridged and paraphrased source material with her own comment".<ref>Crook, xxix.</ref> Shelley wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, [[memoir]] and anecdote, and authorial evaluation, a biographical style made popular by the eighteenth-century critic [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[Lives of the Poets]]'' (1779<U+2013>81).<ref>Crook, xxvii; Mazzeo, xli.</ref> She even references Johnson in her "Life of Metastasio":
{{bquote|It is from passages such as these, interspersed in his letters, that we can collect the peculiar character of the man &ndash; his difference from others &ndash; and the mechanism of being that rendered him the individual that he was. Such, dr Johnson [''sic''] remarks, is the true end of biography, and he recommends the bringing forward of minute, yet characteristic details, as essential to this style of history; to follow which precept has been the aim and desire of the writer of these pages.<ref>Qtd. in Guerra, 225.</ref>}}
She was also influenced by the biographical style of her father, [[William Godwin]]. He believed that biography could tell the history of a culture, that a person's environment was fundamental in shaping one's character, and that biography could serve a pedagogical function.<ref>Guerra, 224.</ref> 

The eighteenth-century saw a new kind of history emerge with works such as [[David Hume|David Hume's]] ''History of England'' (1754&ndash;63). Frustrated with traditional histories that only highlighted military and monarchical history, Hume and others "place[d] a new emphasis on mercantile growth, industry, the arts, social relations, domestic life, and its affective components".<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 229.</ref> Combined with the rise of [[sensibility]] at the end of the eighteenth century, this "produced an unprecedented historical interest in the social, the inward, and particularly the realm of affect".<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 229.</ref> These topics and this style explicitly invited women into the discussion of history as both readers and writers.<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 229.</ref> However, this new history often made the private sphere subordinate to the public sphere, therefore women writers took it upon themselves to bring the "sentimental and private elements" to "the center of historical consciousness".<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 230.</ref> In this way, they argued for the political relevance of women. Women's sympathetic connection to those who were suffering enabled them to speak for marginalized groups, such as slaves or the poor.<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 231.</ref> 

Shelley practiced this early form of [[feminist]] [[historiography]]. For her, biographical writing was supposed to, in her words, "form as it were a school in which to study the philosophy of history"<ref>Qtd. in Kucich, "Biographer", 228.</ref> and to teach "lessons". These "lessons" consisted, most frequently and importantly, of criticisms of male-dominated institutions, such as [[primogeniture]].<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 236.</ref> She also praises societies that are progressive when it comes to gender relations, writing, for example: "No slur was cast by the [Renaissance era] Italians on feminine accomplishments...Where abstruse learning was a fashion among men, they were glad to find in their friends of the other sex, minds educated to share their pursuits".<ref>Qtd. in Kucich, "Biographer", 236.</ref> Shelley was particularly interested in tying private, domestic history to public, political history.<ref>Guerra, 227.</ref> She emphasizes the domestic, romance, the family, sympathy, and compassion in the lives of the people she is writing about. This is particularly true in the essays on [[Petrarch]] and [[Vincenzo Monti]], for example.<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 233; Guerra, 227.</ref> She believed that these forces would improve society and that women could be at the forefront of them, tying her work to that of other early feminist historians such as [[Mary Hays]] and [[Anna Jameson]].<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 230-31, 233, 237; Crook, xxviii; Orr, "Introduction", lii.</ref> Shelley argued that women possessed a "distinctive virtue" in their ability to sympathize with others and should use this ability to help improve society.<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 238.</ref> She castigates [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], for example, for abandoning his children at a [[foundling hospital]], decrying the "masculine egotism" associated with his philosophy in a criticism similar to the one she makes of Victor Frankenstein in ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818).<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 236; Orr, "Introduction", l.</ref> 

Unlike most of her novels, which only had a print run of several hundred copies, the ''Lives'''s print run of about 4,000 for each volume, "became one of her most influential political interventions".<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 235; see Crook, xxv for the exact number; Mazzeo, xli.</ref> However, Shelley's biographies have not been fully appreciated until recently. The ''Lives'' were not reprinted until 2002 and little scholarship has been done on them because there is a critical tradition which "dismiss[es] the ''Lives'' as hack work churned out rapidly in order to pay off debts".<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 227.</ref>

==''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal''==
The three-volume ''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal'' contains numerous biographies of fourteenth- through eighteenth-century writers and thinkers. The first volume was published on [[1 February]] [[1835]], the second on [[1 October]] [[1835]]<ref>Mazzeo, xxxviii.</ref> and the third on [[1 November]] [[1837]].<ref>Vargo, xv.</ref> A pirated edition of the first two volumes was published in the United States by Lea and Blanchard in 1841.<ref>Mazzeo, xxxix; Vargo, xxvii.</ref>

===Italian Lives===
The ''Italian Lives'' constitute the first two volumes of ''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal''. The poet, journalist, and literary historian [[James Montgomery]] contributed the biographies of [[Dante]], [[Ariosto]], and [[Tasso]]. Historian of science Sir David Brewster contributed that of [[Galileo]]. [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writer [[Mary Shelley]] contributed the rest: [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Lorenzo de'Medici]], [[Marsiglio Ficino]], [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], [[Angelo Poliziano]], Bernardo Pulci, Luca Pulci, [[Luigi Pulci]], Cieco Da Ferrara, Burchiello, Bojardo, [[Francesco Berni|Berni]], [[Machiavelli]], [[Guicciardini]], [[Vittoria Colonna]], [[Giovanni Battista Guarini|Guarini]], [[Gabriello Chiabrera|Chiabrera]], [[Tassoni]], [[Giambattista Marini|Marini]], [[Vincenzo da Filicaja|Filicaja]], [[Metastasio]], [[Goldoni]], [[Alfieri]], Monti, and [[Ugo Foscolo]].<ref>Mazzeo, xl, xlviii-li.</ref> Although there has been some confusion regarding the attribution of these biographies, the ''Lives'''s recent editor, Tilar Mazzeo, notes that Shelley claimed authorship of all of these and granted Montgomery and Brewster<U+2019>s authorship of the others in her letters.<ref>Mazzeo, xl.</ref>

Shelley began the ''Italian Lives'' on [[23 November]] [[1833]] and by December was working methodically: she wrote the ''Lives'' in the morning and read novels and memoirs in the evening.<ref>Mazzeo, xxxviii.</ref> She added the revision of her novel ''[[Lodore]]'' (1835) and the checking of its [[galley proof|proofs]] to this already busy schedule.<ref>Mazzeo, xxxviii.</ref> She worked on the ''Italian Lives'' for two years and was probably paid <U+20A4>140 for each volume.<ref>Mazzeo, xxxviii.</ref> By the time she began working on the ''Lives'', Shelley had spent twenty years studying Italian authors and had lived in Italy for five years.<ref>Mazzeo, xli.</ref> Her major sources for the biographies were first-person memoirs and literature by the authors, aided by scholarly works.<ref>Mazzeo, xli.</ref> Shelley had gained much of her knowledge of these authors in Italy when she was researching her [[historical novel]] ''[[Valperga (novel)|Valperga]]'' (1823); the rest she obtained from her own books or those of her father, the philosopher [[William Godwin]]. She had limited access to books at this time and was thus restricted to those she owned or could borrow from friends.<ref>Mazzeo, xlii.</ref> Shelley copied sections from some of these works in what would today be termed [[plagiarism]], but, as Mazzeo explains, because the standards of intellectual property and [[copyright]] were so different in the early nineteenth century, Shelley's practice was common and not considered unethical. She writes, "Mary Shelley's objectives in the ''Italian Lives'' were to gather what had been said by these authors and about them and to infuse the work with her own judgements on their interest and credibility."<ref>Mazzeo, xlii.</ref> 

[[Image:James Montgomery.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Montgomery]] (1771 &ndash; 1854)]]
In addition to printed sources, Shelley interviewed [[Gabriele Rossetti]] and other Italian expatriates in London for the modern biographies; she included "some notices not yet known, but worthy of publication" and Mazzeo writes that "her lives of the contemporary Italian poets &ndash; Alfieri, Monti and Foscolo &ndash; are unquestionably the most personal and most inspired of the two volumes".<ref>Mazzeo, xliii.</ref> Of all of the volumes Shelley contributed to the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'', ''Italian Lives'' is, according to Nora Crook, the "most overtly political".<ref>Crook, xxx.</ref> She reveals her [[republicanism]] by depicting Machiavelli as a patriot, for example.<ref>Crook, xxx.</ref> She continually praises writers who resist tyranny by "cultivat[ing] private virtue and inner peace".<ref>Crook, xxxi; see also Guerra, 225.</ref> Shelley was a friend to the Italian exiles and a proponent of the ''[[Risorgimento]]''.<ref>Mazzeo, xlvii.</ref> While her politics are less overt in the ''Lives'' than in other works, her views clearly reflect her statement in 1844 in ''[[Rambles in Germany and Italy]]'': "Italian literature claims, at present, a very high rank in Europe. If the writers are less numerous, yet in genius they equal, and in moral taste they surpass France and England".<ref>Qtd. in Mazzeo, xlvii; see also Guerra, 225.</ref>

Montgomery<U+2019>s biographies are written in a "digressive though not unengaging manner".<ref>Mazzeo, xl.</ref> He was not particularly concerned with factual accuracy, though he identifies his sources; he was more interested in developing "extended parallels between Italian and English literature".<ref>Mazzeo, xl.</ref> He draws a picture of the subject<U+2019>s character but also includes a fair amount of autobiographical material.<ref>Mazzeo, xl.</ref> In his formally written biography of Galileo, Brewster includes descriptions of sixteenth-century scientific experiments as well as information on other Renaissance natural philosophers. According to Mazzeo, "Brewster<U+2019>s pious religiosity infuses the work and his opinions".<ref>Mazzeo, xl.</ref>

Ninety-eight review copies of the first two volumes were sent out, eliciting five reviews.<ref>Mazzeo, xxxviii.</ref> Some of these were simply short advertisements for the ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia''. Mazzeo writes that the "commentary on both volumes was mixed and often contradictory, but on balance positive; prose style, organisation and use of source materials were the three most often identified points of discussion."<ref>Mazzeo, xxxix.</ref> The first volume was declared to be unorganized, the second volume less so. Reviewers did not agree regarding the frequent use of primary sources nor on the "simplicity" of the writing style.<ref>Mazzeo, xxxix.</ref> The ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'' dedicated the most substantial review and extracts to the volumes, writing that "we by no means think highly of the volume as a whole", complaining that it presented facts and dates without context. However, the reviewer praises two of Mary Shelley<U+2019>s biographies: Petrarch and Machiavelli. According to Mazzeo, "he notes, in particular, her efforts to question conventional assumptions about Machiavelli by returning to autobiographical materials and credits her with originality on this point."<ref>Mazzeo, xxxix.</ref> ''[[Graham's Magazine]]'', in a piece probably by its co-editor, [[Edgar Allan Poe]], positively reviewed the pirated American edition.<ref>Mazzeo, xxxix-xl.</ref>

===Spanish and Portuguese Lives===
The ''Spanish and Portuguese Lives'' constitute the third volume of the ''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal''. Mary Shelley wrote all of the biographies in this volume except [[Alonso de Ercilla y Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga|Ercilla]]; it is not known who contributed this piece. She, therefore, wrote: [[Boscan]], [[Garcilaso de la Vega]], [[Diego Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Luis de Leon]], [[Fernando de Herrera|Herrera]], [[Francisco de S<U+00E1> de Miranda|Saa de Miranda]], [[Jorge de Montemayor]], [[Crist<U+00F3>bal de Castillejo|Castillejo]], [[Cervantes]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Vicente Espinel]], [[Esteban Manuel de Villegas|Estaban de Villegas]], [[Luis de G<U+00F3>ngora|G<U+00F3>ngora]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]], [[Pedro Calder<U+00F3>n de la Barca|Calder<U+00F3>n]], Ribeyro, [[Gil Vicente]], [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Ferreira|Ferreira]], and [[Camoens]].

During the two or three years that Mary Shelley spent writing the ''Spanish and Portuguese Lives'' from 1834 or 1835 to 1837, she also wrote a novel, ''[[Falkner (novel)|Falkner]]'' (1837), experienced the death of her father, [[William Godwin]], started to write a biography of him, and moved to London after her son, [[Percy Florence Shelley]], entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>Vargo, xv.</ref> She had more difficulty with these ''Lives'' than with the other volumes, writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: "I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish & Portugeeze [''sic''] Lives <U+2013> This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, & the difficulty of getting books & information".<ref>Qtd. in Vargo, xix.</ref> According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor of the ''Spanish and Portuguese Lives'', Spanish books were hard to come by in England and not much was known regarding Shelley<U+2019>s subjects.<ref>Vargo, xix.</ref> However, Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: "The best is that the very thing which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting <U+2013> namely <U+2013> the treading in unknown paths & dragging out unknown things <U+2013> I wish I could go to Spain."<ref>Qtd. in Vargo, xix.</ref> She also, while living in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], refused to go to the [[British Library]] in London, writing: "I would not if I could <U+2013> I do not like finding myself a stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating [''sic''] to their own".<ref>Qtd. in Vargo, xx.</ref> At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of <U+201C>feminist protest<U+201D> others see it as <U+201C>matter of comfort and practicality<U+201D>, since the reading rooms were <U+201C>noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated<U+201D>.<ref>Vargo, xx.</ref> Shelley<U+2019>s continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that "there is always a sense of an engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what seems accurate, even if she cannot be privy to information gleaned by subsequent scholarship".<ref>Vargo, xxii.</ref> Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by people who knew the authors and when translations of the author's works were unavailable or poor, she provided her own.<ref>Vargo, xxvi-xxvii.</ref>

Shelley "begins entries with information about the life and character of the writer, gives examples from their work both in their original language and in translation..., and concludes each entry with a summary of the beauties and defects of the writers".<ref>Vargo, xxii.</ref> She also focuses on the problems of writing biography itself, engaging in a written dialogue with the biographical theories of her now-dead father. In "Of History and Romance" Godwin had written that for the genius, "I am not contented to observe such a man upon the public stage, I would follow him into his closet. I would see the friend and the father of a family, as well as the patriot".<ref>Qtd. in Vargo, xxiii.</ref> Shelley and Godwin had seen the negative effects of Godwin's theory when he published ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798), his biography of Shelley's mother, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. Its frank description of Wollstonecraft's affairs and suicide attempts shocked the public and sullied her reputation. Shelley criticizes this technique in her biographies, concerned that "follies" are being perpetuated.<ref>Vargo, xxiii.</ref> She is even more "concerned with the methodological dangers of inferring that because nothing is known, there never was anything to know".<ref>Vargo, xxiii.</ref>

Overall, the ''Spanish Lives'', according to Vargo, "tells a story of the survival of genius and moral independence in spite of oppression by public institutions, both individually and nationally".<ref>Vargo, xxiv.</ref> Shelley argues that Spain's literature is directly related to its politics and she tried to "inspired her readers with the best qualities of a nation as embodied in the life and works of its greatest writers".<ref>Vargo, xxv.</ref> She also includes masked autobiographical comments.<ref>Vargo, xxvi.</ref>

The two-volume ''Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France'' included the following works by Mary Shelley: [[Montaigne]], [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|Rouchefoucauld]],<ref>Orr, "Introduction", liv-lvii.</ref> [[Moli<U+00E8>re]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Madame de S<U+00E9>vign<U+00E9>]], [[Boileau]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois F<U+00E9>nelon|F<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>lon]],[[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Condorcet]], [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], [[Madame Roland]], and [[Madame de Sta<U+00EB>l]].<ref>Orr, "Notes", xviii-xxii.</ref> [[Rabelais]] and [[La Fontaine]] are by as an yet unidentified author.<ref>Orr, "Introduction", xli.</ref> Shelley was the only contributor to Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopaedia'' to give such pride of place to female biographical subjects.<ref>Morrison, 131.</ref> In these volumes, "she stretched the definition of 'Eminent Literary Men' not just by including two more women but by her choice of a quartet of French revolutionary personalities who were political actors more than, or as much as writers: Condorcet and Mirabeau, Mme Roland and Mme de Sta<U+00EB>l".<ref>Orr, "Introduction", xlvi.</ref> As Clarissa Campbell Orr, a recent editor of the ''French Lives'', explains, this choice "represents a concerted attempt to disassociate the early ideals of the French Revolution from its subsequent extremism and state-authored bloodshed".<ref>Orr, "Introduction", xlvii.</ref> 

Mary Shelley worked on the ''French Lives'' from the end of 1837 until the middle of 1839 for which she was paid <U+20A4>200 upon completion.<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xl-xli.</ref> No other substantial projects occupied her during this time and research materials were easily accessible; she even subscribed to a specialist [[circulating library]] to acquire books.<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xli.</ref>

Mary Shelley spoke French fluently and was knowledgeable about seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French literature.<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xxxix.</ref> Although she was distilling other works, the biographies are still deeply personal works and have autobiographical elements.<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xxxix.</ref> Orr writes that they "are the culmination of her work for Lardner, and represent the final stage of a sustained overview of four literatures. Few British women of letters in the 1830s could command this extensive range and write so confidently about four national cultures."<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xxxix.</ref> Orr compares Shelley to the historical writers [[Lady Morgan]], [[Frances Trollope]], [[Anna Jameson]], and [[Agnes Strickland|Agnes]] and [[Eliza Strickland]].<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction, xxxix-xl.</ref> Shelley<U+2019>s assessment of French literature was not as generous as her evaluation of Italian literature. She criticized its artificiality, for example.<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xl.</ref> However, the biographies are "written with a sprightly narrative thrust and an agreeable tone".<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xliii.</ref> She also often provided her own translations and often focused on themes that resonated with her own life.<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xliii, l-li.</ref> 

The ''French Lives'' also provided Shelley with a way to celebrate literary women, particularly the ''[[salon (gathering)|salonni<U+00E9>res]]''. In her life of de S<U+00E9>vign<U+00E9>, Shelley celebrates "her chaste widowhood; her loyalty as a friend; [and] her maternal devotion".<ref>Orr, "Introduction", lii.</ref> Orr writes that "looking more closely at the very various roles of women in the [''French Lives''], it is hard to see a clear pattern".<ref>Orr, "Introduction", liii.</ref> She argues that "the most consistent 'feminism' displayed throughout ''French Lives II'' lies in her examination of French attitudes toward love, marriage, and sexuality".<ref>Orr, "Introduction", liii.</ref> Shelley portrays customs such as taking lovers sympathetically, explaining it in the context of France's arranged marriages.<ref>Orr, "Introduction", liii.</ref> Overall, Orr explains, Shelley's "historical sympathy for the varied circumstances of women's relationships mirrors her personal practice of understanding and assisting those of her women friends who transgressed moral norms".<ref>Orr, "Introduction", liii.</ref> The biographies of Roland and Sta<U+00EB>l pay close "attention to women's abilities and the social conditions that either hinder or encourage their potential".<ref>Kucich, "Biographer", 238.</ref> Shelley argues that women are as intellectually capable as men, but lack a sufficient education and are trapped by social systems such as marriage that restrict their rights.<ref>Kucich,  "Biographer", 238.</ref> The emphasis that Shelley places on education and reading reflect the influence of her mother's ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). Shelley also defends her own life choices by defending Roland's and Sta<U+00EB>l's.<ref>Morrison, 133.</ref>  In these two biographies, Shelley reinforces contemporary gender roles while at the same time celebrating the achievements of these women.<ref>Morrison, 127.</ref> She describes Roland through traditionally feminine roles:
{{bquote|She was her husband's friend, companion, amanuensis; fearful of the temptations of the world, she gave herself up to labour; she soon became absolutely necessary to him at every moment, and in all the incidents of his life; her servitude was thus sealed; now and then it caused a sigh; but the holy sense of duty reconciled her to every inconvenience.<ref>Qtd. in Morrison, 137.</ref>}}
Shelley also defends her "unwomanly" actions, however, by arguing that they were "beneficial" to French society.<ref>Morrison, 140.</ref> Shelley's most overt feminist statement in the ''French Lives'' comes when she criticizes [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] novel ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' (1761), writing "his ideas...of a perfect life are singularly faulty. It includes no instruction, no endeavours to acquire knowledge and refine the soul by study; but is contracted to mere domestic avocations".<ref>Qtd. in Orr, "Introduction", liv.</ref>

Sixty review copies were sent out of each volume but only one short notice of the first volume of ''French Lives'' has been located in the ''[[Sunday Times]]''.<ref>Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xliii.</ref> The volumes were pirated in the United States by Lea and Blanchard of [[Philadelphia]]. The pirated volumes were reviewed by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in ''[[Graham<U+2019>s Lady<U+2019>s and Gentleman<U+2019>s Magazine]]'' in 1841. He wrote, "a more valuable work, when considered solely as an introduction to French literature, has not, for some time, been issued from the American press."<ref>Qtd. in Orr, <U+201C>Introduction<U+201D>, xliii.</ref>
