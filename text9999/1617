==Plot==
[[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) distracts himself from his romantic problems involving the  choice between [[CNBC]] host [[List of 30 Rock characters#Avery Jessup|Avery Jessup]] ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) and his high school sweetheart [[List of 30 Rock characters#Nancy Donovan|Nancy Donovan]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors, Subhas (Subhas Ramsaywack) and Khonani (Kapil Bawa). Five years ago, Khonani signed a contract to take the 11:30 p.m. janitorial shift from Subhas and informs Jack that he is ready to start at the new time. Jack grants him permission, and calls a meeting with Subhas informing him that Khonani will take over the 11:30 shift. Subhas is not happy with this, so Jack decides to move him to 10:00 p.m., which Subhas has no problem with. As he begins his scheduled shift, Khonani is unhappy with it as there is no trash to pick up because Subhas has already collected it. Khonani complains to Jack about this, resulting in Jack returning Subhas to 11:30, and Khonani leaving NBC to work at a casino.

Meanwhile, [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) is distraught to learn that although her writing staff sometimes hang out after work, they never invite her. She tells Jack<U+2014>her boss<U+2014>about this, however, Jack explains that it is best for her to keep her distance from them. Later, Liz's assistant [[Cerie Xerox]] ([[Katrina Bowden]]) announces that her wedding is back on and that Liz and [[Jenna Maroney]] ([[Jane Krakowski]]) need to plan a bachelorette party for her. Liz decides to have the party at her apartment and prove to her employees<U+2014>who are invited<U+2014>that she can be fun to be with. At the bachelorette party, staff members [[Pete Hornberger]] ([[Scott Adsit]]), [[Frank Rossitano]] ([[Judah Friedlander]]), [[Toofer Spurlock|James "Toofer" Spurlock]] ([[Keith Powell]]) and [[J. D. Lutz]] ([[John Lutz (television writer)|John Lutz]]) show up, but want to leave as they are not having a good time. Liz gets upset about this, calls them out for not inviting her to hang out with them and demands that they apologize to her.

At the same time, [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) is torn between his commitments to his pregnant wife [[List of 30 Rock characters#Angie Jordan|Angie Jordan]] ([[Sherri Shepherd]]) and his desire to party. He asks [[NBC page]] [[Kenneth Parcell]] ([[Jack McBrayer]]) to assist with any of Angie's needs, however, it becomes too much for Kenneth to deal with and he tells Tracy that he needs to be with her instead. Tracy realizes he needs to be with Angie, but changes his mind and goes to a strip club. After returning home and in order to stay there, Tracy decides to wear his dog's [[shock collar]] on himself. Tracy then sends Kenneth to take his place at Liz's party. Unbeknownst to Kenneth, Tracy's dog has followed him to the bachelorette party. Kenneth bursts in Liz's home with Tracy's dog right behind him, resulting in the staff hiding from the dog after it attacks them. They all turn to Liz to get rid of the dog, which she at first refuses. She eventually agrees to help them, after they tell her she is a mother figure to them and finding comfort in the title. Liz distracts the dog, and the staff exits her apartment unharmed.

The episode received generally mixed critical reception. ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Nathan Rabin found the episode less enjoyable than "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". He explained that when he first learned that the show would tackle the Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien situation "I felt a surge of excitement and optimism.

[[James Poniewozik]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' observed, "NBC's public troubles have been ''30 Rock''{{'}}s greatest blessing this season, providing it with satiric fodder from ''The Jay Leno Show'' to the Comcast acquisition. The show may not be the best sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely the best work of NBC-criticism."
