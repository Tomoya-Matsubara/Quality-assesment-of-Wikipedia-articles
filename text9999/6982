'''Reginald Case''' (December 23, 1937 - April 24, 2009) was an American artist who made American Folk Art collages<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/whitney.htm](1978) Art About Art, Jean Lipman, Richard Marshall</ref> and Hollywood iconographic mixed-media assemblages and sculptures.

==Life and work==

Case was born in [[Watertown, NY]]<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=3815|title= Survivor |publisher =Smithsonian Institution|accessdate= March 5, 2014}}</ref> and graduated from [[Watertown High School (New York)|Watertown High School]] in 1955. He studied at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] receiving a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree, [[San Francisco State University]] and [[Boston University]] where he earned the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees. He studied with Peter Busa at SUNY Buffalo and [[Robert Gwathmey]] and [[Walter Tandy Murch]] at [[Boston University]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/politics.htm](1993) Exhibition Catalog, "Reginald Case: Hollywood Without Politics" Statement by Robert Metzger, Director, Reading Museum, Reading, PA</ref>  Upon completing his graduate studies in [[Boston]] he taught at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and Norfolk State College (now [[Norfolk State University]]). 

During this time, he completed a series of large [[still-life]] paintings which extended the imagery of [[Giorgio Morandi]] by elongating vessels and vases, transforming them into "architectonic towers".<ref name=autogenerated1 />  The direct quality of the collage textures led him to abandon these paintings altogether and turn to [[collage]] as his next form of expression.<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/handbook.html](1985) The Collage Handbook, John & Joan Digby</ref>  The [[Jewish Holocaust]] was a prevalent theme in Case<U+2019>s early pieces <U+2013> in these modest but masterfully executed and consistent works, Case has been compared to something of a graphic [[Edgar Allan Poe]] or [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]] by Ronald A. Kuchta, Director of the [[Everson Museum of Art]] in [[Syracuse, NY]].<ref>[http://reginaldcase.com/everson.htm] 1978) Exhibition Catalog Statement, "Reginald Case Collages", Ronald Kuchta, Director, Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse, NY</ref>

Case's 1980's-90's work in [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[collage]] and construction fused early influences in film, [[photography]], and [[architecture]].<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/american_artist.htm](1993) American Artist, Brett Busang</ref>  Beginning with [[Rudolph Valentino]] from the 1920s through the 1930s with [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Buck Rogers]], and into the 1940s with [[Betty Grable]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], Case culminated this body of work with a series of objects that focused on [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/mm_legend.htm](2006) "Life as a Legend: Marilyn Monroe" statement, Wendy Blazier, Senior Curator, Boca Raton Museum of Art, Boca Raton, FL</ref>

Case continued with contemporary works of [[Barbie]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)]] that reflected the glamour of an earlier era.<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/barbie.htm](1995) Art, Design, & Barbie, Valerie Steele</ref>  In these there is an iconography of twentieth-century life that explores the imagery at the roots of [[American history]] and [[popular culture]].<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/american_icon.htm](1989) American Icons, Farleigh Dickinson Univ., Madison, NJ</ref><ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/immortal.htm] (1997) Exhibition Catalog statement, Wendy McDaris, "Elvis & Marilyn 2 X Immortal"</ref>  In a recent series conmsisting of four groups of photo collage prints, Case has depicted Marilyn Monroe in variations called "MARILYN MONEY". This series substitutes her image for American currency and are notated with quotations by her reflecting on her life, e.g. "Hollywood is a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul." <ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/album-marilynmoney/index.html] "MARILYN MONEY", A series of photo collage prints</ref>

Additional works by Case have made oblique references to [[9/11]] in his series of Gouache Heads,<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/article_heads.htm](2001) Parks, J. "The Gouache Heads of Reginald Case", Watercolor Magazine, Fall.</ref> "365 Views of [[Delray Beach]]"<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/365views.htm] (2002) "365 Views of Del Ray Beach", exhibition statement, Gallery Camino Real, Boca Raton, FL.</ref> and the series of [[New York City]] altered painted photographs.<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/album_ny/index.html] New York City Altered painted photographs.</ref> Each of these series cast a shadow on the event as seen from a distance of TV or Photographic News images. 

His work was shown for many years at the Allan Stone Gallery, NYC, along with the paintings of [[Richard Estes]] and [[Wayne Thiebaud]].<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/CCABC.html](1990) Capital Cities /ABC, Exhibition, NYC, Catalog of Exhibition</ref>  He has also had major museum exhibitions of his work shown at the [[Everson Museum of Art]], [[Syracuse, NY]];<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/everson.htm](1978) Exhibition Catalog Statement, "Reginald Case Collages", Ronald Kuchta, Director, Everson Museum, Syracuse, NY</ref> [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]], [[Utica, NY]];<ref>[http://www.reginaldcase.com/munson.htm] (1976) Exhibition Catalog , Reginald Case Paintings , Munson Williams Proctor Arts Institute , Utica, NY  Artist Statement .</ref> Reading Museum, [[Reading, PA]];<ref name=autogenerated1 /> and the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Richmond, VA]]. Case<U+2019>s work is also represented in many private and public collections, including the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], MA; [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington D.C.; [[The British Museum]], [[London]]; The Fogg Art Museum, [[Harvard University]], Cambridge, MA; The Jewish Museum, NYC; The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], NYC; [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[London]]; and others. An exhibition showing many of the iconic Collages & Assemblages by Case will be at The [[Butler Institute of American Art]] from October 12 through December 31, 2008.  Louis A. Zona, Director of the [[Butler Institute of American Art]], writes in the exhibition catalog, " The work of Reg Case recalls the genius of [[Joseph Cornell]] and salutes as well the singular vision of [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Like [[Warhol]], he both pays tribute to such pop culture icons as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis]] and Madonna and simultaneously causes us to reflect upon the superficialality of much of what we hold precious." <ref>[http://reginaldcase.com/ButlerExpo/index.html](2008) Catalog Statement, "Reginald Case, Collage-Assemblage Exhibition", Louis A.Zona, Director, The [[Butler Institute of American Art]],Youngstown,  OH.</ref>
