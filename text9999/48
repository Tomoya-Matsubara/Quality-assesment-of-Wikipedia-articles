<onlyinclude>This '''list of basil cultivars''' is a comprehensive list of cultivated [[variety (biology)|varieties]] ([[cultivar]]s) of [[basil]].</onlyinclude> Each is used as a culinary herb. Several are also used as decorative plants. All true basils are [[species]] of genus ''[[Ocimum]]''.  The genus is particularly diverse, and includes [[annual plant|annuals]], non-woody [[perennial plant|perennials]] and [[shrub]]s native to [[Africa]] and other [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions of the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]].<ref name="hsa">{{cite web

The Herb Garden was a gift to the United States from the [[Herb Society of America]].</ref> most, but not all culinary basils are [[cultivar]]s of ''O. basilicum'' - [[sweet basil]]. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are [[hybrid]]s. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.<ref>{{cite conference

Basil cultivars vary in several ways. Visually, the size of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the ''Mammoth basil'' and ''Lettuce leaf basil'' to the tiny leaves of the ''Dwarf bush basil''. More practically, the fragrance of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of [[essential oil]]s contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 [[cineol]], [[linalool]], [[citral]], methyl chavicol ([[estragole]]), [[eugenol]] and methyl [[cinnamate]], although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.<ref name="katzer"/>
