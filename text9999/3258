The '''legal history of cannabis in the United States''' relates to the regulation of [[marijuana]] use for medical or recreational purposes in the [[United States]]. Prohibitions on the use of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' as a drug arose in many states from 1906 and onward. By the mid-1930s were regulated as a drug in every state, including 35 states that adopted the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]].<ref name="druglibrary.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/vlr/vlr3.htm |title=Richard J. Bonnie & Charles H. Whitebread, II: PASSAGE OF THE UNIFORM NARCOTIC DRUG ACT |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref>

In the 1970s many [[Places that have decriminalized cannabis in the United States|places]] in the United States started to [[Decriminalization of cannabis in the United States|decriminalize cannabis]]. Most places that have decriminalized cannabis have one or more of [[Civil penalty|civil fines]], drug education, drug treatment in place of [[incarceration]], [[Criminal law|criminal]] charges for possession of small amounts of cannabis, or have made various cannabis offenses the lowest priority for [[Policing in the United States|law enforcement]]. In the 1990s many places began to legalize [[medical cannabis]], which conflicts with federal laws; cannabis is a [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I]] drug according to the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970, which classified cannabis as having high potential for abuse, no medical use, and not safe to use under medical supervision. Multiple efforts to [[Cannabis rescheduling in the United States|reschedule cannabis]] under the Act have failed, and the [[United States Supreme Court]] has ruled in ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop]]'' and ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' that the federal government has a right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes.

==Early history==
In 1619 [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] colony law declared that all settlers were required to grow hemp or cannabis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Deitch|first=Robert|title=Hemp - American History Revisited|year=2003|publisher=Algora Publishing|location=New York City|isbn=0875862136|pages=9-24}}</ref>  In 1797 George Washington grew [[hemp]] (cannabis) for fiber production at Mount Vernon as one of his primary crops. The 44-gun frigate [[USS Constitution]], or 'Old Ironsides', took over 60 tons of hemp for rigging, including an anchor cable 25&nbsp;inches in circumference. The [[Conestoga wagon|Conestoga]] wagons and prairie schooners of pioneer days were covered with hemp canvas. Indeed the very word 'canvas' is derived from 'cannabis'.<ref name="Etymology">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=canvas |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref> Prohibitions on the use of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' as a drug arose in many states from 1906 onwards. By the mid-1930s cannabis and [[marijuana]] were regulated as a drug in every state by laws instituted through the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]].<ref name="druglibrary.org"/>

== Criminalization (1900s) ==
The first significant instance of cannabis regulation appeared in the [[District of Columbia]] in 1906, though this law was not an outright prohibition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm |title=Statement Of Dr. William C. Woodward |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref>  Regulation of cannabis followed in Massachusetts (1911), New York (1914), and Maine (1914). Simultaneously tensions were building in the western and southwestern states regarding the influx of Mexicans to America. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drug Use and Abuse|year=2003|publisher=[[Cengage Learning{{!}}Wadsworth Publishing]]|location=[[Belmont, California]]|isbn=9780155085176|pages=426-428|author=Maisto, Stephen; Galizio, Mark; Connors, Gerard|edition=4th}}</ref> Later in that decade negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. In 1913 California passed the first state marijuana prohibition law, criminalizing the preparation of hemp and its products, the phrase "Indian Hemp" (''[[Cannabis indica]]'') is sometimes used or "loco weed".  Other states followed with marijuana prohibition laws including: Wyoming (1915); Texas (1919); Iowa (1923); Nevada (1923); Oregon (1923); Washington (1923); Arkansas (1923); and Nebraska (1927).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canorml.org/background/ca1913.html |title=The Origins of California's 1913 Cannabis Law |publisher=Canorml.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref>

=== Indian hemp regulation (1925) ===
In 1925 the [[United States]] supported regulation of Indian hemp, also known as [[hashish]], in the [[International Opium Convention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1920/willoughby.htm |title=W.W. WILLOUGHBY: OPIUM AS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM, BALTIMORE, THE JOHNS HOPKINS PRESS, 1925 |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> The convention banned exportation of "Indian hemp", and the preparations derived therefrom, to countries that had prohibited its use and required importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required "exclusively for medical or scientific purposes". The convention did not ban trade in fibers and other similar products from European hemp, and traditionally grown in the United States, which are very tall with a low [[THC]] content. According to the 1912 edition of a Swedish encyclopaedia the European hemp grown for its fibers lacks the THC content that characterizes Indian hemp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nf/hasjisj.htm |title=Nordisk familjebok 1912 |publisher=Runeberg.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref>

=== Uniform State Narcotic Act (1925<U+2013>1932) ===
The [[Uniform State Narcotic Act]], first tentative draft in 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, was a result of work by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]]. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs should have the same safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed The [[Harrison Act]] in 1914 and The Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/people/anslinger/traffic/appendix1.htm |title=Anslinger H. J.,Tompkins W F The Traffic In Narcotic |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> As a result of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, the [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] encouraged state governments to adopt the act. By the middle of the 1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/drug_law_timeline.htm|title=Drug Law Timeline, Significant Events in the History of our Drug Laws|author=Keel, Robert|publisher=[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/ Schaffer Library of Drug Policy]|accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/t10a.htm |title=The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937,Transcripts of Congressional Hearings |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/people/anslinger/traffic/chapter6.htm |title=ANSLINGER H.

=== Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1930) ===
[[Image:Killerdrug.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Federal Bureau of Narcotics|FBN]] public service announcement used in the late 1930s and 1940s]]
The use of cannabis and other drugs came under increasing scrutiny after the formation of the [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] (FBN) in 1930,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3 |title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> headed by [[Harry J. Anslinger]] as part of the government's broader push to outlaw all recreational drugs.
{{quote|"When the present administration took office ten countries had ratified the Geneva Narcotic Limitation Convention. The United States was one of these ten.... It was my privilege, as President, to proclaim, on that day, that this treaty had become effective throughout the jurisdiction of the United States....On Jan. 1, 1933, only nine nations had registered their ratification of the limitation treaty. On Jan. 1, 1935, only nine States had adopted the uniform State statute. As 1933 witnessed ratification of the treaty by thirty-one additional nations, so may 1935 witness the adoption of the uniform drug act by at least thirty-one more states, thereby placing interstate accord abreast of international accord, to the honor of the legislative bodies of our States and for the promotion of the welfare of our people and the peoples of other lands."|[[Franklin D.

Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. The FBN produced propaganda films promoting Anslinger's views and Anslinger often commented to the press regarding his views on marijuana.<ref>{{cite book|last=McWilliams|first=John C.|title=The Protectors: Harry J.

===The 1936 Geneva Trafficking Conventions===
In 1936 the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs]] (1936 Trafficking Convention) was concluded in Geneva. The US, led by Anslinger, had attempted to include  the criminalization of all activities in the treaty <U+2013> cultivation, production, manufacture and distribution <U+2013> related to the use of opium, coca (and its derivatives) and cannabis for non-medical and non-scientific purposes. Many countries opposed this and the focus remained on illicit trafficking. Article 2 of the Convention called upon signatory countries to use their national criminal law systems to "severely" punish, "particularly by imprisonment or other penalties of deprivation of liberty" acts directly related to drug trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/canadasenate/vol3/chapter19_1936_geneva.htm |title=The 1936 Geneva Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref> The US refused to sign the final version because it considered the convention too weak, especially in relation to extradition, extraterritoriality and the confiscation of trafficking profits.<ref>International Law Commission, 62nd session (2010-06-18).

|   The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 made possession or transfer of cannabis illegal throughout the [[United States]] under [[Law of the United States|federal law]], excluding medical and industrial uses, in which an expensive [[Excise|excise tax]] was required. Annual fees for the tax were $24 ($337 adjusted for inflation) for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 annually ($14 adjusted for inflation) for medical and research purposes, and $3 annually ($42 adjusted for inflation) for industrial uses. Detailed cannabis sale logs were required to keep record of cannabis sales. Selling cannabis to any person who has previously paid the tax is $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, it is $100 ($1,406 adjusted for inflation) per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who has not registered and paid the special tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/mjtaxact.htm|title=Full Text of the Marihuana Tax Act as passed in 1937|publisher=[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/ Schaffer Library of Drug Policy]|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Producer of marihuana.jpg|thumb|Tax stamp for a producer of hemp]]
The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) opposed the act because the tax was imposed on physicians prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis [[Cannabis cultivation|cultivation]] and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis be added to the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]].<ref name="Woodward">{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm|title=Statement of Dr. William C.

[[Image:Hanfstengel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemp, bast with fibers. The stem in the middle.]]

In 1916 [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and [[Lyster Hoxie Dewey|Lyster H. Dewey]] created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 "Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material", in which they concluded that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was "favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood". Dewey and Merrill believed that hemp hurds were a suitable source for paper production.<ref>Lyster H. Dewey and Jason L. Merrill [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17855 ''Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material''] [[USDA]] Bulletin No. 404, Washington, D.C., 1916-10-14, p.25</ref> In 2003 95% of the hemp hurds in [[EU]] were used for animal bedding, almost 5% were used as building material. In addition 70<U+2013>80% of hemp fiber produced was used in specialty pulp for cigarette papers and technical applications.<ref name="michael">{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a902981619~frm=titlelink |title=Michael Karus: European Hemp Industry 2002 Cultivation, Processing and Product Lines.

In 1916 the United States Department of Agriculture assumed, partly based on the incorrect finding about hemp hurds of USDA Bulletin No. 404, that the production of hemp would rise in the US. In reality production fell until 1933, due to competition with other fibers and imports. In 1933 production was only around 500 tons of hemp fiber per year. 1934<U+2013>1935 the cultivation of hemp began to increase, but still with a very low volume compared with other types of fibers and with no significant increase in production of paper from hemp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametec.com/hemp/fiberwars/index.html |title=Fiber Wars: The Extinction of Kentucky Hemp by David P.

There was also a misconception about the intoxicating effects of hemp because it has the same active substance, [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]], which is in all cannabis strains. Hemp normally has a minimal amount of THC when compared to recreational cannabis strains but, in the 1930's, [[THC]] was not yet fully identified.<ref>[http://matters.ecnp.nl/number11/interview2.shtml "Interview with the winner of the first ECNP Lifetime Achievement Award: Raphael Mechoulam, Israel"] (February 2007).

=== State Office of Narcotics and Drug Abuse (1977) ===
In January 1976, California's careful study of the economic impact of its law repealing prohibitions of use went into effect. The law reduced the penalty for personal possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possesion of more than an ounce was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six months in jail. After the law went into effect,  the states annual spending towards marijuana laws went down 74%. Prior to the law, the state had been spending from $35 million to $100 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis of marijuana policy.|year=2010|publisher=General Books|isbn=9781154437256}}</ref> 

=== Mandatory sentencing and three-strikes (1984, 1986) ===

During the [[Reagan Administration]] the Sentencing Reform Act provisions of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 created the Sentencing Commission, which established mandatory sentencing guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/politics/judbranc/ovrweb03.pdf|title=An Overview of the United States Sentencing Commission|accessdate=2007-04-30|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}</ref> The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 reinstated mandatory prison sentences, including large scale cannabis distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html|title=1985 - 1990|publisher=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> Later an amendment created a [[three-strikes law]], which created mandatory life sentences for repeat drug offenders and allowed the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] to be used against "drug kingpins."<ref name=pbs/>

=== United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative (2001) ===
{{Main|United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative}}

In 1996 [[California]] voters passed [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]], which legalized [[medical cannabis]]. The [[Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]] was created to "provide seriously ill patients with a safe and reliable source of medical cannabis, information and patient support" in accordance with Proposition 215.<ref>{{cite book|title=Student Study Guide to Accompany Drugs and Society|year=2008|publisher=[[Jones & Bartlett Learning]]|location=[[Sudbury, Massachusetts]]|isbn=9780763759322|author=Hanson, Glen; Venturelli, Peter; Fleckenstein, Annette|page=355}}</ref> 

In January 1998 the U.S. Government sued Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative for violating [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] laws created as a result of [[Controlled Substances Act of 1970]]. On May 14, 2001, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop]]'' that federal anti-drug laws do not permit an exception for [[medical cannabis]] and rejected the common-law medical necessity defense to crimes enacted under the Controlled Substances Act because [[United States Congress|Congress]] concluded cannabis has "no currently accepted medical use" when the act was passed in 1970.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-151.ZS.html "UNITED STATES v.

=== Gonzales v. Raich (2005) ===
{{Main|Gonzales v. Raich}}
''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' 545 U.S. 1 (2005) was a decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (6-3) that even where persons are cultivating, possessing, or distributing medical cannabis in accordance with state-approved medical cannabis programs, such persons are violating federal marijuana laws and can therefore be prosecuted by federal authorities because the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] permits federal authorities (pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act) to prosecute any and all offenses of federal marijuana laws. The respondents argued that because the cannabis in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely within the state of California, pursuant to California medical cannabis laws, their activity did not implicate interstate commerce and as such, could not be legitimately regulated by the federal government through the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that cannabis grown for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that, because the intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to the interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where persons are using medical cannabis in full compliance with state law, those persons can still be punished by federal authorities for violating federal law.<ref>Supreme Court. [http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZS.html "GONZALES V. RAICH"] (2008). [[Cornell Law School]].</ref>

To combat state-approved medical cannabis legislation, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) routinely targets and arrests medical cannabis patients as well as seizing medical cannabis and the business assets of growers and medical dispensaries.  However, the Obama administration has indicated that this practice may potentially be curtailed.<ref>Memorandum for selected United States Attorneys, Department of Justice, October 19, 2009, http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/medical-marijuana.pdf</ref>

In 1978 Robert Randall sued the federal government for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his [[glaucoma]]. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the [[Food and Drug Administration]] set up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the [[University of Mississippi]] and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 [[George H. W. Bush]] discontinued the program after Randall tried to make [[AIDS]] patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to seven people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the [[George W. Bush administration]] to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Court's pot ruling won't apply to patients in federal program|date=2005-06-07|accessdate=2007-05-02|first=Wendy|last=Koch|publisher=[[USA Today]]|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-07-pot-program_x.htm}}</ref>

=== Advocacy ===
Several U.S.-based advocate groups seek to modify the [[drug policy of the United States]] to decriminalize cannabis.  These groups include [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]], [[Students for Sensible Drug Policy]], [[Drug Policy Alliance|The Drug Policy Alliance]], the [[Marijuana Policy Project]], [[NORML]], [[Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis]], and [[Americans for Safe Access]].  In June 2005, [[libertarian]] economist Jeffrey Alan Miron and over 530 other economists, including [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Milton Friedman]], called for the legalization of cannabis in an open letter to President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States Congress]], [[Governors of the United States|Governors]], and State Legislatures of the United States.<ref name=letter>[http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html An Open Letter to the President, Congress, Governors, and State Legislatures] Prohibition Costs</ref> The open letter contained Miron's "Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition in the United States" report ([http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/MironReport.pdf view report]).

The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, even in the absence of a court ruling to do so. The [[Richard Nixon]] administration did not implement the study's recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm |title=Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding - Table of Contents |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>

In 1973 [[Oregon]] decriminalized cannabis.<ref name="oregon">McVeigh, Frank J. ''Brief History of Social Problems: a critical thinking approach'', 2004. Page 62.</ref> Laws changed again in 1995 that reduced penalties. Possession of one ounce or less became legally defined as a "violation" (a crime that is considered a lesser offence than a misdemeanor) and now is punishable by a $500 to $1,000 fine that can be, in some jurisdictions, paid off by means of community service. Possession of multiple containers of any weight, or possession of more than one ounce can sometimes add the additional crime "Intent to Sell". In some cases people who have no marijuana, but are caught at the scene of a drug bust, are charged with "Frequenting". Stricter punishments exist for sale, cultivation, and proximity to schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/51/51.F3d.269.94-5711.html |title=51 F.3d 269 |publisher=Ftp.resource.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref>

To take advantage of this program, offenders have to plead guilty to the charge, agree to take part in treatment, regular drug screenings, and regular reporting to the drug court judge for a minimum of one year. Should the offender fail to comply with one or more of the requirements they may be removed from the drug court and incarcerated at the judge's discretion.
