The main '''buildings of Jesus College''', one of the [[colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] of the [[University of Oxford]], are located in the centre of the [[Oxford|city]] between [[Turl Street]], [[Ship Street, Oxford|Ship Street]], [[Cornmarket Street]], and [[Market Street, Oxford|Market Street]]. [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]] was founded in 1571 by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] upon the petition of a [[Wales|Welsh]] clergyman, [[Hugh Price (lawyer)|Hugh Price]], who was treasurer of [[St David's Cathedral]]. Her foundation charter gave to the college the land and buildings of White Hall, a university hall that had experienced a decline in student numbers. Price added new buildings to those of White Hall, and construction work continued after his death in 1574. The first of the college's [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangles]], which included the hall, chapel, and principal's lodgings, was completed between 1621 and 1630.  Construction of the second quadrangle began in the 1630s; but was interrupted by the [[English Civil War]] and was not completed until about 1712. Further buildings were erected in a third quadrangle during the 20th century, including science laboratories (now closed), a library for undergraduates, and additional accommodation for students and [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellows]]. In addition to the main site, the college owns flats in east and north Oxford, and a sports ground.

The chapel, which was dedicated in 1621 and extended in 1636, was extensively altered in 1864 under the supervision of the architect [[George Edmund Street]]. The alterations have had their supporters and their critics; one historian of the college ([[Ernest George Hardy|Ernest Hardy]], principal from 1921 to 1925) described the work as "ill-considered".<ref name=Hardy172/>  The hall's original [[hammerbeam roof]] was hidden by a plaster ceiling in 1741 when rooms were installed in the roofspace. The principal's lodgings, the last part of the first quadrangle to be constructed, contain wooden panelling from the early 17th century. The Fellows' Library in the second quadrangle dates from 1679 and contains 11,000 antiquarian books; it was restored at a cost of <U+00A3>700,000 in 2007. A new [[Junior Common Room]], about twice the size of its predecessor, was completed in the third quadrangle in 2002, and a <U+00A3>7.3&nbsp;million project to build new student and teaching rooms in Ship Street, opposite the college, is due to be completed in June 2010.

Eleven parts of the college are [[listed building]]s, including all four sides of the first and second quadrangles. Nine parts, including the chapel, hall, and principal's lodgings, have the highest Grade I designation, given to buildings of exceptional interest. Two other parts (an external wall and an early 20th-century addition in the third quadrangle) have a Grade II designation, given to buildings of national importance and special interest. The architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] described the first quadrangle as "small and pretty",<ref name=Pevsner142/> and said that the [[reredos]] behind the chapel altar was "heavily gorgeous";<ref name=Pevsner143/> he was, however, critical of the Old Members' Building in the third quadrangle, opened in 1971, describing it as a "mannered and modish design".<ref name=Pevsner145/> The historian [[John Julius Norwich]] said that the first quadrangle had "a curious charm",<ref name=JJN514/> while the second quadrangle had "a strong feeling of unity owing to the somewhat relentless succession of ogival gables".<ref name=JJN514/> The poet [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]] said that the clear planning of the first and second quadrangles, coupled with the relationship of their size to the heights of the buildings around them, "make what would be undistinguished buildings judged on their detail, into something distinguished".<ref name=Bet142/> However, he regarded the early 20th-century additions in the third quadrangle as "dull".<ref name=Bet142/>

The college buildings on the main site are arranged in three [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]s, the first quadrangle containing the oldest college buildings and the third quadrangle the newest. The quadrangles are often referred to as "First Quad", "Second Quad" and "Third Quad" for short.<ref name=Access>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/notices/accessguide.php|title=Access Guide|date=4 August 2005|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref> As is often the case in Oxford colleges, the rooms in the older buildings are connected to the quadrangles by a series of staircases, rather than horizontally to each other by internal corridors.  The staircases are numbered (sometimes using [[Roman numerals]]):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/history/secondquad.php|title=The Second Quad|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|date=12 November 2000|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref> staircases 1 to 5 are in the first quadrangle; staircases 6 to 13 in the second quadrangle; and staircases 14 to 21 in the third quadrangle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.jesus.ox.ac.uk/Jesus%20College%20-%20Map.pdf|title=Jesus College Map|format=PDF|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref> The stairs on staircase 3 were replaced with stone steps in 1878, setting what one historian of the college ([[J. N. L. Baker]], a [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellow]] of the college from 1939 to 1971) termed "an unfortunate precedent", since the "ugly pattern" of staircase 3 was adopted when repairs were carried out to staircase 13 after a fire in 1882.<ref name=VCH276/>

==Foundation and buildings in 1571==
[[File:Hugh Price.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An elderly man in black robes and cap; the picture is in a decorated gold frame.|The portrait of [[Hugh Price (lawyer)|Hugh Price]], college founder, in the hall]]
The foundation charter of the college, issued by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] on 27 June 1571 upon the petition of [[Hugh Price (lawyer)|Hugh Price]] (treasurer of [[St David's Cathedral]]), gave to the college a site located between the present-day [[Market Street, Oxford|Market Street]] (to the south) and [[Ship Street, Oxford|Ship Street]] (to the north); this remains part of the college's site.  The charter also gave the buildings of White Hall, one of a number of university halls in this location.<ref name=Hardy9>Hardy, p. 9</ref> Halls provided lodgings and meals for students at the university, and sometimes lectures and tuition as well. As the system of colleges grew, however, halls declined in popularity and their sites and buildings tended to be taken over by colleges.<ref>Hardy, pp. 2, 4</ref> White Hall itself had previously belonged to [[St Frideswide's Priory]] and dated back to the 13th century; it was described as "a large tenement with a great stone gate"<ref name=Hardy9/> and was sometimes known as Great White Hall.<ref name=VCH271> Baker (1954), p. 271</ref> Over time, it seems to have absorbed neighbouring halls, including Little White Hall on Ship Street from about 1450, which was at one time owned by [[Osney Abbey]].<ref name=VCH271/> By 1571, however, White Hall was either completely or virtually deserted by students, making it possible for Price to secure the site for the new college.<ref>Hardy, pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref><ref name=Baker1>Baker (1971), p. 1</ref> The college paid a [[quit-rent]] for the land upon which White Hall stood to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], which had acquired the assets of St Frideswide's Priory. This was initially 26 [[shilling (United Kingdom)|shilling]]s and 8 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]], but it had been reduced to 8 pence before 1631; it was paid until 1866, when the charge was redeemed. The land was described in Christ Church's records as extending "from the Street to the Walnut tree; & in breadth from the Bowling-Alley to the mud-wall", although no measurements were given.<ref name=Allen109>Allen (1998), p. 109</ref>

The college also acquired the sites of other former halls in the vicinity, including Laurence Hall, previously owned by [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]].<ref name=Hardy17>Hardy, p. 17</ref>  The last principal of White Hall, James Charnock, had taken a lease on Laurence Hall, but was unable to attract sufficient students to satisfy Lincoln College and so he transferred the lease to [[Griffith Lloyd]], who was principal of Jesus College from 1572 until his death in 1586; Lloyd bequeathed the lease to the college in his will.<ref name=Allen112>Allen (1998), p. 112</ref><ref name=Allen124>Allen (1998), p. 124</ref> Part of the college chapel was later erected on the site, which measured {{convert|32|yd|m}} by {{convert|30|yd|m}}.<ref name=VCH271/><ref name=Hardy17/>

==First quadrangle==
===Construction===

The first [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] is smaller than the later second quadrangle, measuring {{convert|93|ft|6|in|m}} by {{convert|77|ft|m}}.<ref name=RCHME60>Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, p. 60</ref> The buildings that now surround the first quadrangle were erected in stages between 1571 and the 1620s; the principal's lodgings were the last to be built. Progress was slow because the new college lacked the "generous endowments" that earlier colleges enjoyed.<ref>Tyack, p. 82</ref> Before new buildings were completed, the students lived in the old buildings of White Hall.<ref name=Hardy17/> Between 1571 and his death in 1574, Price spent about <U+00A3>1,500<ref group="n"><U+00A3>1,500 in 1574 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1500|1574|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> on the construction of buildings that were two storeys high. These ran from [[Turl Street]] (on the east of the site) south towards the corner of Cheyney Lane (as Market Street was then known) and then west along Cheyney Lane to the buildings of the old Great White Hall.<ref name=Hardy18>Hardy, p. 18</ref> Land at the corner of Turl Street and Cheyney Lane was leased and built upon, and then purchased in 1580.<ref name=Baker1/> There is a college tradition, recorded in the college's first book of benefactors in the 17th century, that Elizabeth I gave "all kind of timber" from [[Shotover]] and [[Stow Wood]] for buildings erected by Price.<ref name=VCH271/> Until the later building works of [[Griffith Powell]] and [[Eubule Thelwall|Sir Eubule Thelwall]] (principals from 1613 to 1620 and 1621 to 1630 respectively), the college site consisted of "a number of smallish, mainly detached buildings with nothing resembling a formal garden layout in between".<ref name=Allen112/>

[[Ralph Agas]]'s 1578 map of Oxford shows the extent of the buildings at that time. Laurence Hall is the "isolated group of buildings"<ref name=Allen110>Allen (1998), p. 110</ref> on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street.  There is then a gap along Turl Street before a building positioned south of the current entrance with glazed windows facing Turl Street and a large window or loft door at its north end; another building then runs to the old White Hall buildings.<ref name=Allen112/> The Turl Street entrance appears from Agas's map to date from after Price's death, and the north side of the building on Turl Street may have been integrated into an extension early in the 17th century, although the date of such work is unclear;<ref>Allen (1998), pp. 112<U+2013>113</ref> Price is nevertheless sometimes given the credit for the archway on the inside of the entrance on the first quadrangle.<ref>Baker (1971), p. 3</ref> Overall, whilst the structure of the buildings erected by Price remains, only a little of his work can be seen from the outside, after various alterations in the intervening centuries;<ref name=JJN514>Norwich, p. 514</ref> nevertheless, his buildings have been said to retain "much of their original character".<ref name=VCH271/>

===Later work===
Further work was carried out to the east side of the college, fronting onto Turl Street, in 1756 under [[Thomas Pardo]] (principal from 1727 to 1763). A new doorway replaced the previous Elizabethan one, and the front of the college was remodelled in the [[Palladian]] style&nbsp;<U+2013> oblong [[sash window]]s were inserted at all levels and the original [[gable]]s on the Turl Street side of the building were removed.

The ''Front'' of ''Jesus College'', within these few years, has been cleared from the ''Bronze'' of Antiquity, and beautified with a modern ''Portico''.

Construction of the chapel began when Griffith Powell was Principal (1613<U+2013>1620).

The architectural historian [[Giles Worsley]] has described the chapel's east window as an instance of [[Gothic Revival]] architecture, rather than Gothic Survival, since a choice was made to use an outdated style&nbsp;<U+2013> [[classical architecture]] had become accepted as "the only style in which it was respectable to build".<ref name=Worsley>{{cite journal|title=The Origins of the Gothic Revival: A Reappraisal: The Alexander Prize Essay|last=Worsley|first=Giles|authorlink=Giles Worsley|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|series= Sixth Series|volume=3|year=1993|pages=pp. 108<U+2013>109|publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]]|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3679138|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref> The window has seven main sections ("lights") topped with five-headed flower shapes, or [[Charge (heraldry)#Flowers|cinquefoils]], and [[tracery]] running vertically.<ref name=RCHME60/> The chapel is one of various buildings at the universities of Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] from the first half of the 17th century where Gothic designs were deliberately chosen in preference to Classical; other examples are the chapel of [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], the chapel windows and hall roof at [[Wadham College, Oxford]], and the library of [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where the library of 1624 was built with Gothic windows since "some men of judgement" preferred the old fashion as it was "most meet for such a building".<ref name=Worsley/> Similarly, the artist and art historian Aymer Vallance, writing in 1908, said that Gothic architecture, though "ailing and doomed", "lingered longest" at Oxford University, adding that the chapel windows of Jesus and Wadham were "almost as astonishing for their period" as the "magnificent" 1640 [[fan vault|fan-vaulted]] entrance to the hall of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], built nearly three hundred years after fan vaulting had been used in the cloisters of [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Art in England during the Elizabethan and Stuart periods|year=1908|last=Vallance|first=Aymer|url=http://www.archive.org/details/artinenglanddur00salagoog|location=London|publisher=[[Studio Magazine]]|page=4|oclc=536183}}</ref> The only examples of classical style in Oxford before the Civil War were [[Archbishop Laud]]'s Canterbury Quad at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's]] and a few gateways such as those at the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] by [[Nicholas Stone]]; Cambridge had even less.<ref>Airs, 108. Airs takes a different view to Worsley on the question of revival vs survival, seeing the conservatism of the colleges as "static", reflecting that the Gothic formulas evolved still suited the needs of the universities perfectly.</ref> The chapel has not been universally appreciated, however:  the [[antiquarian]] and archivist [[Rowley Lascelles]] wrote in 1821 that "excepting that it was built by private contributions from the gentry of Wales, it would be cruel ''to say any thing about it''".<ref>Lascelles, p. n174</ref>

On 15 June 1863, the principal [[Charles Williams (academic)|Charles Williams]] (principal 1857<U+2013>1877) and fellows agreed to renovate the chapel.<ref name=VCH276/> One of the prime movers behind the decision was the vice-principal, [[Lewis Gilbertson]], as part of his unsuccessful attempt to move the college towards [[Anglo-Catholicism]].<ref name=Baker59>Baker (1971), p. 59</ref> The architect [[George Edmund Street]] was appointed, and had almost free rein in his work. In 1863, he said to the [[bursar]] that the chapel was "so good in style considering its late date" that it would be "very inadvisable to alter it in any respect, save one, the old features of the walls and roofing".<ref name=Allen61>Allen (2000), p. 61</ref> However, he later said that the fittings were "incongruous", with the seats being "so thoroughly uncomfortable that kneeling is rendered all but impossible, and sitting even is concerted into a sort of penance".<ref name=Allen61/> His work was completed in 1864, at a cost of <U+00A3>1,679 18s 10d.<ref group="n"><U+00A3>1,679 18s 10d in 1864 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1679|1864|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> The arch of the chancel was widened and the memorials to Sir Eubule Thelwell and Francis Mansell, which had been on each side of the arch, were moved to the north wall of the chancel. The original Jacobean woodwork was removed, with the exception of the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit, new seats were installed and new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel. A stone [[reredos]] was added behind the altar, although the design originally submitted by Street was not approved and he was asked to make changes.<ref name=VCH276/><ref name=Hardy223>Hardy, p. 233</ref>  The reredos as finally installed has three marble panels: a [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion scene]] (centre), Christ carrying his cross (right) and Christ on the knees of St Mary (left). The altar has a slab and six pillars, all made from [[granite]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Some notable altars in the Church of England and the American Episcopal Church |oclc=3581946|last=Wright|first=John|year=1908|page=128|url=http://www.archive.org/details/somenotablealtar00wrig|accessdate=28 June 2009|dateformat=dmy|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|location=New York}}</ref>

Views of Street's alterations have differed. On 21 October 1864, ''Building News'' reported that the restoration was nearing completion and was of "a very spirited character". It said that the new "handsome" arch showed the east window "to great advantage", with "other improvements" including a "handsome reredos" and an "exceedingly beautiful" pavement of marble, alabaster and [[Mintons|Minton's]] [[encaustic tile]]s.<ref name=VCH276/> Llewellyn Thomas said that there might be two opinions as to the success of the restoration, but there was "no doubt" that widening the arch was a mistake, since "it has permanently dwarfed the proportions of the building".<ref name=Thomas386/>  He said that the new woodwork, "though good of its kind", presented "too violent a contrast" with the ante-chapel screen.<ref name=Thomas386/>  Hardy was also critical, calling the work "ill-considered".<ref name=Hardy172/> He complained that the Jacobean woodwork had been sold for too little, saying that it had been "ruthlessly torn up and sold for a mere song to a passing stranger", and described the reredos as "somewhat tawdry".<ref name=Hardyx/> William Stride, writing at about the same time as Hardy, said that the "beautiful" Jacobean interior of the chapel had been "destroyed", and Oxford had "narrowly escaped other irreparable losses".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/details/exetercollege00striuoft|title=Exeter College|year=1900|last=Stride|first=William|accessdate=28 June 2009|dateformat=dmy|location=London|publisher=F. E. Robinson & Co.|oclc=6500971}}</ref> Norwich said that the restoration was "good in individual details" but was "sadly damaging to its character and atmosphere".<ref name=JJN514/>

In contrast, Pevsner called the reredos "heavily gorgeous".<ref name=Pevsner143/> One chaplain in the 20th century covered up the reredos with curtains, describing the brown and white marbling as looking like "corned beef".<ref name=Drake/> Betjeman, however, was heard when showing a group around the college to describe the altar as "delicious";<ref name=Drake/> he also wrote that the chapel's "fine classic screen" had "somehow survived a fearful 'restoration{{' "}}.<ref name=Bet142>Betjeman, p. 142</ref> The curtains around the altar and a carpet covering the tiling in the aisle were removed when the new organ was installed in 1994, following the organ builder's advice that these items detracted from the chapel acoustics.<ref name=Drake/> The work proved to be Street's only commission at the university, although he built or restored a number of churches in the city. In his biography of his father, Arthur Street said that it was possible that George Street's "very decided adherence to the earlier phase of Gothic, and the eagerness with which he argued that Oxford had already enough of debased types, and should revert to the purity of the early forms, may have frightened the authorities".<ref>{{cite book|title=Memoir of George Edmund Street, R.A., 1824<U+2013>1881|last=Street|first=Arthur Edmund|oclc=221708029|publisher=J.

The woodwork removed by Street was sold for a nominal sum, with a condition that it could only be used for a hall, chapel or library.<ref>Baker (1971), p. 42</ref> Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of [[Forest School (Walthamstow)|Forest School]] in [[Walthamstow]], east London (an institution that previously had no link to the college).<ref name=Allen63/> Panels under the [[Altar rails|communion rail]] were also removed from the chapel, even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value, and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante-chapel screen and the adjoining seats. Some of the woodwork was transferred to a church in [[Bodedern]], [[Anglesey]].<ref name=Allen63>Allen (2000), p. 63</ref> Some of the panels may also have been re-used in the Fellows' Library (in the second quadrangle); other panelling at Bodedern came from the college, but not apparently from the chapel, and so may have been from a disused library gallery.<ref name=Allen67/><ref name=Allen68>Allen (2000), p. 68</ref>

In 1654, when [[Michael Roberts (college principal)|Michael Roberts]] was principal, the college accounts record payment for construction of a ball court. This was to the west of the principal's garden (which is to the north of the lodgings, alongside Ship Street), between a [[outhouse|privy]], stables, and the wall of the garden. Ball courts, bowling greens and [[grove (nature)|grove]]s were often added within the precincts of colleges during the 17th century so that undergraduates could amuse themselves under the watchful eyes of their tutors, rather than indulge in forbidden pursuits such as drinking in alehouses. In 1757, principal Thomas Pardo added the area of the ball court to the garden of the lodgings and had a coach-house built there, which was reached from an entrance on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street along a driveway across the north of the garden.<ref name=ball>{{cite journal|journal=The Jesus College Record|year=1995/1996|page=p. 68|title=The College Ball Court|last=Allen|first=Brigid}}</ref>

Francis Mansell, who was appointed principal in 1630, raised hundreds of pounds from donors towards the building of a second quadrangle in 1640.

The library, which is {{convert|65|ft|m}} long and {{convert|21|ft|9|in|m}} wide,<ref name=Fordyce55>Fordyce, p. 55</ref> was built on the first floor of a free-standing building, above common rooms for students and fellows, and largely followed the layout of Thelwall's earlier library.<ref name=Allen65>Allen (2000), p. 65</ref> The books were moved to their new location in 1679.<ref name=Allen72>Allen (1995/1996), p. 72</ref> The library contains bookcases dating from about 1628, which are decorated with [[strapwork]] and were used in the earlier library.<ref name=Pevsner144/><ref name=Allen66>Allen (2000), p. 66</ref> The bookcases are {{convert|7|ft|m}} long, with hinged desks. Some of the books were [[Chained library|secured with chains]]; these were removed at an unknown date, although some payments for chains were made until 1765.<ref name=Fordyce55/> A gallery storey was added, probably in 1691, and a wood-panelled gallery runs the length of the east side.<ref name=Allen66/> It is reached by "an ingenious and graceful spiral staircase".<ref name=Fordyce55/> On the west side of the library, there are nine windows on two levels; on the east side, there are now six on the lower level and four (blocked by gallery bookcases) on the upper level.<ref name=Allen67>Allen (2000), p. 67</ref><ref name=Allen66/> The layout of the library, as well as the position of an exposed timber, suggests that there was previously a gallery on the west side. If so, it was not used after 1800, when the library was re-arranged.<ref name=Allen68/> It may have been removed and transferred to the church in [[Bodedern]] along with some woodwork from the chapel after Street's renovations, with other sections of the chapel woodwork re-used in the east gallery&nbsp;<U+2013> some of the carved patterns in the gallery are identical to those in Bodedern, and some of the gallery panels have been cut to fit their position, or are loose-fitting or upside down, suggestive of repositioning from a previous location.<ref name=Allen67/>

Hardy's opinion was that, "if only it had an open timber roof instead of the plain ceiling, it would be one of the most picturesque College Libraries".<ref name=Hardyxi/> Another author said (in 1914, after the provision of a library for undergraduates elsewhere in the quadrangle) that it was "one of the most charming of Oxford libraries, and one of the least frequented".<ref name=Gibson>{{cite book|title=Some Oxford libraries|year=1914|oclc=3791497|last=Gibson|first=Strickland|page=89|url=http://www.archive.org/details/someoxfordlibrar00gibsrich|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=28 June 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> The window at the south end has four lights; Pevsner noted that it was Gothic in style, despite the date of construction.<ref name=Pevsner144/> Simon Jenkins said that the library is "a delight".<ref name=Jenkins>{{cite book|title=England's Thousand Best Houses|last=Jenkins|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Jenkins|page=680|isbn=9780141329299|year=2009|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}</ref> Betjeman wrote in 1938 that "The woodwork, the brown leather of the books, the clear windows and the slim height of the room make it one of the best little-known sights of Oxford".<ref name=Bet142/>

The roof was leaking, the floorboards had been affected by [[dry rot]] and [[death watch beetle]], and new heating and ultra-violet light controls were needed to help preserve the books.

===Laboratories===
The laboratories, which were in use from 1907 to 1947, occupied three floors.<ref name=VCH277/> They were overseen (for all but the last three years) by the [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[David Chapman (scientist)|David Chapman]], a college fellow from 1907 to 1944.

The laboratories led to scientific research and tuition (particularly in chemistry) becoming an important part of the college's academic life.<ref name=Long46/> The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the [[University of Wales]] who wished to continue their research at Oxford.<ref>Long, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref> The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students; they were closed in 1947.<ref name=VCH277/><ref>Long, p. 57</ref> The college then converted the laboratories (along with other rooms in the buildings adjoining Ship Street) into further accommodation for students and fellows, as well as relocating the Meyricke Library and providing a separate library for Celtic studies.

===Old Members' Building and Junior Common Room===
[[File:Old Members Building.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Four windows from a two-storey stone building projecting in a V-shape|Part of the Old Members' Building (opened in 1971)]]
The Old Members' Building, which contains a music room, 24 study-bedrooms and some lecture rooms, was built between 1969 and 1971, and designed by J. Fryman of the Architects' Design Partnership.<ref name=Pevsner144/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/tour/oldmembersbuilding.php|title=Old Members' Building|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|date=29 December 2000|accessdate=22 June 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> It was built after a fundraising appeal to [[Old Member]]s to mark the college's quatercentenary, and was opened by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor = [[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]] | encyclopedia =The Encyclopaedia of Oxford | title = Jesus College | year = 1992 | publisher = [[Pan Macmillan]] | location = London | isbn = 0333486145 | page = 201}}</ref> It is a concrete building, faced with [[Abrasive blasting|grit-blasted]] concrete and, as elsewhere in the third quadrangle, Clipsham limestone.<ref name=Pevsner145/><ref name=Third/> Part of the ground floor is an extension at the rear of [[W. H. Smith]] on [[Cornmarket Street]], and so access is at first-floor level. Pevsner was critical of the use of [[Cant (architecture)|canting]] in the design. He wrote that the entrance was reached by staircases set diagonally, which is "typical of the building", and that Fryman had "succumbed to the canting fashion of today: canted back, canted exposed supports on the entrance floor, canted base to the two upper floors".<ref name=Pevsner145>Pevsner, p. 145</ref>  He called it a "mannered and modish design".<ref name=Pevsner145/> Tyack referred to the building's "[[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]]".<ref>Tyack, p. 332</ref> Norwich said that it displays "an antipathy to the right-angle that makes the Front Quad look positively Pythagorean".<ref name=JJN514/> A conference room, known as the [[John Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] Room after a former principal, was added in 1989.<ref name=Third/> The Old Members' Building is connected by a bridge (Pevsner adding, "Of course it runs diagonally")<ref name=Pevsner145/> to further college rooms above shops on Ship Street. These were added in 1908<U+2013>1909 and were also designed by England. Pevsner noted the "four symmetrically grouped gables".<ref name=Pevsner145/><ref name=Third/> There are also some student rooms above the shops in Cornmarket Street, some of which were refurbished in 2000.<ref name=Death8>{{cite journal|journal=The Jesus College Record|title=College News and Notes|pages=p. 8|last=De'Ath|first=John|year=2000}}</ref>

In 2002, a two-year project to rebuild the property above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, carried out by the architects Maguire & Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new [[Junior Common Room]] (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Jesus College Record|year=2002|last=Clarke|first=Peter|title=College News and Notes|pages= pp. 3<U+2013>5}}</ref> The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Jesus College Record|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|year=2004|page=p. 7|last=North|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter North (academic)}}</ref>

===Fellows' Garden===
The Fellows' Garden runs behind the west side of the second quadrangle, behind the SCR; it can be reached from there or from the third quadrangle. It dates from 1683, when 3s 6d<ref group="n">3s 6d in 1683 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.15|1683|r=0}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> was spent on making a garden; it would have been about {{convert|100|ft|m}} long and between {{convert|10|to|20|ft|m}} wide, but a further purchase of land in 1735 extended its length to about {{convert|170|ft|m}}. It is now overshadowed by adjoining buildings (including the Old Members' Building).<ref>Allen (1998/1999), p. 49</ref> The college archivist, Brigid Allen, has described it as "a kind of gated tunnel between high buildings, paved, scattered with seats and tables, and filled with gloomy foliage of the purple-leaved plum".<ref name=Allen46/>

==Other buildings==
[[File:Ship Street houses.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A narrow road, pavements either side; on the left, a stone wall; on the right, a row of terraced three storey houses, the upper storeys overhanging the ground floor|Houses on Ship Street]]
The college purchased {{convert|10|acre|km2 sqmi}} of land in east Oxford (near the [[Cowley Road, Oxford|Cowley Road]]) in 1903 for use as a sports ground.<ref name=Accomm/> The 1905 pavilion was replaced in 1998 by a new pavilion on the opposite side of the sports ground; the old pavilion is now used as a table-tennis room (ground floor) with a three-bedroomed flat for graduates above. Residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 (Thelwall House, rebuilt in 1998), with additions between 1988 and 1990 (Hugh Price House and Leoline Jenkins House).<ref name=Accomm/><ref name=North>{{cite journal|journal=The Jesus College Record|last=North|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter North (academic)|year=2001|page=p. 5|title=College News and Notes}}</ref> Writing in 1974, Pevsner said that Thelwall House was one of the recent college buildings that deserved note.<ref>Pevsner, p. 70</ref>

A further development, known as Hazel Court (after [[Alfred Hazel]], principal 1925<U+2013>1944), was built in 2000, bringing the total number of students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135.<ref name=North/> Writing in the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] Journal in 2002, Jeremy Melvin praised the architects of Hazel Court, Maguire & Co., for their "crispness of detail" and "richness of composition"; he said that "the sense of ordered space&nbsp;... recalls the way in which the traditional collegiate quads gave architectural expression to the then-new idea of a university".<ref name=RIBA/> He noted that, whilst the first impression of the houses was Elizabethan with the air of a courtyard garden, "closer inspection reveals a contemporary design sensibility";<ref name=RIBA/> there was, he wrote, "the impression of an order that comes from making the construction explicit whils combining sensitivity to function and use".<ref name=RIBA/> However, he commented that whilst there was plenty of space inside, the furniture "would not look out of place in a motorway hotel".<ref name=RIBA>{{cite journal|journal=RIBA Journal|date=4 February 2002|last=Melvin|first=Jeremy|publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architects]]|url=http://www.ribajournal.com/index.php/feature/article/Order_in_court|issn=1463-9505|title=Order in court|accessdate=6 July 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref>

Donations from [[Edwin Stevens]], an Old Member of the college, enabled the construction in 1974 of student flats at a site in north Oxford on the [[Woodstock Road]], named "Stevens Close" in his honour.<ref name=Accomm>{{cite web|title=Accommodation|url=http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/history/accommodation.php|date=3 September 2001|accessdate=22 June 2009|dateformat=dmy|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford}}</ref> The flats were opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Jesus College Record|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|title=Arthur Edwin Stevens CBE|last=Habakkuk|first=Sir John|authorlink=John Habakkuk|year=1995/1996|page=p. 23}}</ref> The college also owns a number of houses on Ship Street, which are used for student accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/tour/shipstreet.php|title=Ship Street|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|date=29 December 2000|accessdate=22 June 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref>  It has purchased a further site in Ship Street at a cost of <U+00A3>1.8M, which will be converted at a projected cost of <U+00A3>5.5M to provide 31&nbsp;student rooms with en-suite facilities, a 100-seat lecture theatre and other teaching rooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.jesus.ox.ac.uk/shipstreet/index.php|title=The Ship Street Centre: Home|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|year=2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.jesus.ox.ac.uk/shipstreet/support.php|title=The Ship Street Centre: Supporting the project|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|year=2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> The site includes a [[bastion]] from the Oxford city wall, which is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref name=planning>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxford.gov.uk/files/meetingdocs/66691/Item8(1).pdf|title=Report on application for planning consent|publisher=[[Oxford City Council]]|format=PDF|page=4|date=21 August 2007|accessdate=1 July 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> The plans provide for the inner curve of the bastion to be used as a featured alcove in the ground floor reception area and for study bedrooms on the upper floors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.jesus.ox.ac.uk/shipstreet/site.php|title=The Ship Street Centre: The site|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|year=2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> The project is due to be completed in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.jesus.ox.ac.uk/shipstreet/progress.php|title=The Ship Street Centre: Progress|publisher=Jesus College, Oxford|year=2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref>
