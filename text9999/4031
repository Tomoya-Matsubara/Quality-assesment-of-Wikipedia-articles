'''Edward King''' (29 December 1829 - 8 March 1910) was an [[Church of England|Anglican]] bishop.

==Life==

He was the second son of the Reverend Walker King, [[Archdeacon of Rochester]] and rector of [[Stone, Kent]], and grandson of the Reverend [[Walker King]], [[Bishop of Rochester]]; his nephew was the Reverend [[Robert King (footballer)|Robert Stuart King]], who played football for England in 1882. 

King graduated from [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[Oxford]], was ordained in 1854, and four years later became chaplain and lecturer at Cuddesdon Theological College (now [[Ripon College Cuddesdon]]). He was principal at Cuddesdon from 1863 to 1873, when he became [[Regius Professor of Pastoral Theology]] at [[Oxford]] and [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. He was the principal founder of the leading catholic theological college in the Church of England, [[St Stephen's House, Oxford]], now a Permanent Private Hall of the University of Oxford. To the world outside he was known at this time as one of [[Edward Pusey]]'s most intimate friends and as a leading member of the [[English Church Union]]. But in Oxford, and especially among the younger men, he exercised influence by his charm and sincerity. 

In 1885 King was made [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. The most eventful episode of his episcopate was his prosecution (1888<U+2013>1890) for [[Ritualism|ritualistic practices]] before the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Edward White Benson]], and, on appeal, before the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. Dr King, who loyally conformed his practices to the archbishop's judgment, devoted himself unsparingly to the work of his diocese; and, irrespective of his High Church views, he won the affection and reverence of all classes by his real saintliness of character. The bishop, who never married, died in Lincoln.

==Legacy==

Edward King is commemorated in the calendar of the Church of England (with the status of a Lesser Festival or <U+2018>black letter day<U+2019>) on 8 March, the date of his death.
