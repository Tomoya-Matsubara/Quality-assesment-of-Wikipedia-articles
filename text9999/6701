'''USS ''Princess Matoika'' (ID-2290)''' was a transport ship for the [[United States Navy]] during World War I. Before the war, she was a {{sclass|Barbarossa|ocean liner}} that sailed as '''SS ''Kiautschou''''' for the [[Hamburg America Line]] and as '''SS ''Princess Alice''''' (sometimes spelled '''''Prinzess Alice''''') for [[North German Lloyd]]. After her World War I Navy service ended, she served as the [[United States Army]] transport ship '''USAT ''Princess Matoika'''''. In post-war civilian service she was '''SS ''Princess Matoika''''' until 1922, '''SS ''President Arthur''''' until 1927, and '''SS ''City of Honolulu''''' until she was scrapped in 1933.

Built in 1900 for the [[German Empire|German]] Far East mail routes, SS ''Kiautschou'' traveled between Hamburg and Far East ports for most of her Hamburg America Line career. In 1904, she was traded to competitor North German Lloyd for five [[cargo ship|freighters]], and renamed SS ''Princess Alice''. She sailed both transatlantic and Far East mail routes until the outbreak of World War I, when she was interned in the neutral port of [[Cebu City|Cebu]] in the [[Philippines]]. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the newly renamed USS ''Princess Matoika'' carried over 50,000<U+00A0>U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Navy service from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport after that, she continued to return troops and repatriated the remains of Americans killed overseas in the war. In July 1920, she was a last-minute substitute to carry a large portion of the United States team to the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp. From the perspective of the Olympic team, the trip was disastrous and a majority of the team members published a list of grievances and demands of the [[United States Olympic Committee|American Olympic Committee]] in an action known today as the [[Mutiny of the Matoika|Mutiny of the ''Matoika'']].

After her Army career ended, ''Princess Matoika'' was transferred to the [[United States Mail Steamship Line]] for European passenger service in early 1921. After that company's financial troubles resulted in her seizure, ''Princess Matoika'' was assigned to the newly formed [[United States Lines]] and resumed passenger service. In 1922, the ship was renamed SS ''President Arthur'', in honor of the 21st [[List of Presidents of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Chester A. Arthur]]. When changes in U.S. laws severely curtailed the number of immigrants that could enter the country in the early 1920s, the ship was laid up in [[Baltimore]] in late 1923.

''President Arthur'' was purchased in October 1924 by the Jewish-owned [[American Palestine Line]] to begin regular service between New York, [[Naples]], and [[Palestine]]. On her maiden voyage to Palestine, she reportedly became the first ocean liner to fly the [[Flag of Israel|Zionist flag]] at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers. Financial difficulties for American Palestine ended the service after three roundtrips, and the liner was sold to the [[Los Angeles Steamship Company]] for Los Angeles<U+2013>[[Honolulu]] service. Following three years of carrying tourists and freight, the liner burned in [[Honolulu Harbor]] in 1930. She was deemed too expensive to repair and was eventually scrapped in Japan in 1933.

In March 1900 the {{HAPAG|first=long}} announced the plans for 22 new ships totaling {{GRT|150,000|first=yes}} at a cost of $11,000,000.

The ship was {{convert|525|ft|m}} long and featured twin screws powered by two [[quadruple expansion]] [[steam engine]]s that generated {{convert|9000|hp}}. The liner also featured [[bilge keel]]s that helped stabilize her ride. On the interior, ''Kiautschou''{{'}}s first-class [[state room]]s were described as "light and large" and located in the center of the ship. She had two large [[promenade deck]]s, a music room, and a library. Her [[smoking room]] was at the rear of the upper promenade deck, and her large dining room featured a balcony where the ship's orchestra could serenade diners.<ref name=NYT-1904-04-06>{{cite news |  format = pdf | title = Luncheon on a liner | work = The New York Times | date = 6 April 1904 | accessdate =11 April 2008 | page = 16 }}</ref>

''Kiautschou'' sailed on the Hamburg<U+2013>Far East route until May 1902. For one round trip that month, ''Kiautschou'' replaced fellow {{HAPAG}} steamer {{SS|Deutschland|1900|2}} on Hamburg<U+2013>New York service,<ref>{{cite news | title = Hamburg America... | format =  display ad | work = The New York Times | date = 11 May 1902 | page = 25 }}</ref> calling at [[Southampton]] and [[Cherbourg]] on her eastbound trip,<ref>{{cite news | title = Shipping and Foreign Mails | work = The New York Times | date = 4 May 1902 | page = 23 }}</ref> and at Cherbourg and [[Plymouth]] on her westbound return.<ref>{{cite news | title = Shipping and Foreign Mails | work = The New York Times | date = 24 May 1902 | page = 13 }}</ref> After this one transatlantic excursion, ''Kiautschou'' was returned to Hamburg<U+2013>Far East service.<ref name=Bonsor-v1-408 /> On 20 February 1904, in exchange for abandoning the mail routes shared with [[North German Lloyd]], {{HAPAG}} traded ''Kiautschou'' for Lloyd [[cargo ship|freighters]] ''Bamberg'', ''K<U+00F6>nigsberg'', ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'', ''Stolberg'', and ''Strassburg''.<ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 />

== North German Lloyd ==
North German Lloyd renamed the newly acquired ship ''Princess Alice'',<ref name=Bonsor-v2-566 /><ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /> though the German spelling ''Prinzess Alice'' was widely used in contemporary press coverage and, often, by the Lloyd themselves.<ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /> There is some confusion as to who exactly was the namesake of the ship. Edwin Drechsel, in his two-volume work ''Norddeutscher Lloyd, Bremen, 1857<U+2013>1970'', reports that the ship was named equally for [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Princess Alice of Albany]] and [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice Roosevelt]].<ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 /> Princess Alice of Albany was a granddaughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], and the new bride of [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Prince Alexander]] of [[Teck]] in [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]].<ref name=Eilers-215>Eilers, p. 215.</ref> Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the then-current U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was nicknamed "Princess Alice" by the press, and had [[ship naming and launching|launched]] the racing yacht of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], ''Meteor'', at [[Staten Island]] two years before.<ref>Drechsel, Vol. 1, p. 261. Alice Roosevelt had been further honored by the German Empire by the March 1902 renaming of former [[torpedo boat]] ''D2'' to ''Alice Roosevelt''.</ref> [[William Lowell Putnam]] gives the namesake as [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], the daughter of Queen Victoria.<ref>Putnam, p. 145. Putnam states further that [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]] was the wife of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Kaiser Freidrich III]], apparently confusing Alice with her sister [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], who was, in fact, the wife of Kaiser Freidrich III.</ref>

[[File:The-Princesses-Alice.jpg|thumb|left|SS ''Princess Alice'' was named for one or more of these Princesses Alice (from left): [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Princess Alice of Albany]], [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|"Princess" Alice Roosevelt]].]]
''Princess Alice'' departed her new homeport of [[Bremen]] on 22&nbsp;March 1904 for her maiden voyage under her new owners.<ref name=Bonsor-v2-566 /> After arriving in New York draped in flags and bunting, her dining room was the site of a press luncheon thrown by Lloyd staff celebrating her first arrival in that city.<ref name=NYT-1904-04-06 /> ''Princess Alice'' made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to Bremen<U+2013>[[Suez Canal]]<U+2013>Far East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31&nbsp;August.<ref name=Bonsor-v1-408 /> ''Princess Alice'' would continue this pattern<U+2014>sailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season and shifting to the Far East runs for the balance of the year<U+2014>through 1910.<ref name=NYT-1904-04-06 /><!-- description of seasonal plans --><ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /><!-- through 1910 -->

Throughout the rest of her Lloyd North Atlantic career she carried some notable passengers to and from Europe. In May 1905, for example, noted Baltimore [[gynecologist]] [[Howard Atwood Kelly]], one of the co-founders of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], sailed from New York;<ref>{{cite journal | title = Town & Country Calender: Arrivals and Departures | journal = [[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]] | date = 27 May 1905 | volume = 3080 | pages = 6 | location = New York | publisher = Stuyvesant | issn = 0040-9952 | oclc =5878257 }}</ref> author [[Hamilton Wright Mabie]] and his wife sailed from New York the following month.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Town & Country Calender: Arrivals and Departures | journal = Town & Country | date = 8 July 1905 | volume = 3086 | pages = 3 | location = New York | publisher = Stuyvesant |  issn = 0040-9952 | oclc =5878257 }}</ref><!-- 760905912 (3) --> American botanist [[Charles Frederick Millspaugh]] returned to New York aboard the German liner in June 1906,<ref>{{cite news | title = Ocean travelers | work = The New York Times | date = 20 June 1906 | accessdate =11 April 2008 | page = 14 }}</ref> and retired U.S. Navy [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear admiral]] [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] did the same in June 1907.<ref>{{cite news | title = Rear Admiral Mahan returns |work=The Washington Post | date = 21 June 1907 | page = 3 }}</ref> Senator [[Augustus Octavius Bacon|Augustus O.

Prompted by the successful use of [[radio|wireless]] in saving lives during the sinking of {{RMS|Republic|1903|6}} in January 1909, and by proposed U.S. legislation (later passed as the [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910]]) requiring wireless for ships calling at U.S. ports, ''Princess Alice'' received her first wireless set in February 1909.<ref name=NYT-1909-02-12>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9803E6DC153EE733A25751C1A9649C946897D6CF | format = pdf | title = Wireless on more ships | work = The New York Times | date = 12 February 1909 | accessdate =11 April 2008 | page = 1 }}</ref><ref>Pierce, p. 690.<!-- wireless act provision --></ref> Operating with call letters "DKZ" on the 300&nbsp;m band, her radio had a {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on}} range.<ref name="wireless">{{cite book | url = http://earlyradiohistory.us/1909stat.htm | author = [[United States Navy|Navy Department]], Bureau of Equipment | title = List of Wireless Telegraph Stations of the World | location =  Washington, D.C. | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | chapter = List of Merchant Steamers and Private Yachts | date = 1 September 1908 | accessdate =6 May 2008}}</ref>

At 10:00 on 27 May 1909, loaded with over 1,000&nbsp;passengers headed for Europe, ''Princess Alice'' departed the Lloyd pier in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], New Jersey. As she neared [[The Narrows]] in a heavy fog, she steamed to stay clear of outbound [[Compagnie G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale Transatlantique|French Line]] steamer {{SS|La Bretagne||2}} and ran hard aground on a submerged rocky ledge near the [[seawall]] of [[Fort Wadsworth]] a few minutes after 11:00.<ref name=NYT-1909-05-28>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D04EEDD1E31E733A2575BC2A9639C946897D6CF | format = pdf | title = The Prinzess Alice aground in the bay | work = The New York Times | date = 28 May 1909 | accessdate =11 April 2008 | page = 1 }}</ref><ref name=NYT-1909-05-29><!-- time of grounding -->{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9902E5D6153EE733A2575AC2A9639C946897D6CF | format = pdf | title = Prinzess Alice sails | work = The New York Times | date = 29 May 1909 | accessdate =11 April 2008 | page = 2 }}</ref> After the fog lifted, it was revealed that the bow of ''Princess Alice'' had stopped some {{convert|5|ft|m|1}} from the outer walls of the Staten Island fort. [[Lighthouse tender]] ''Larkspur'' was the first ship to come to the aid of the ''Princess'', followed by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[United States Army Quartermaster Corps|Quartermaster's ship]] ''General Meigs''<!-- not USAT Meigs or USS General M. C. Meigs --> and [[Cutter (ship)|revenue cutter]] [[USRC Seneca|''Seneca'']]. No passengers were hurt in the incident and it was determined there was no damage to the hull of the liner. But, despite the effort of attending ships, she would remained stuck on the ledge.<ref name=NYT-1909-05-28 /> Eventually, after offloading {{convert|500|ST|t}} of cargo from her front [[Hold (ship)|hold]] onto [[lighter (barge)|lighters]] called to the scene, ten steam [[tug]]s and power from ''Princess Alice''{{'}}s own engines freed the ship at 01:47 on 28&nbsp;May, almost 15&nbsp;hours after running aground. Unfortunately, the force required to free the liner was great enough that she was then propelled into SS&nbsp;''Marken'', at anchor some distance away, damaging one of that ship's [[Fender (boating)|fenders]].<ref name=NYT-1909-05-29 /> After then making her way to the nearby [[New York City Quarantine Station]], ''Princess Alice'' anchored to reload her cargo, and by 09:05, the was underway again. However, completing her comedy of errors, she ran aground again in soft mud in [[Ambrose Channel]] at 10:15. This time she was able to free herself and proceeded on to Bremen, a little more than 24&nbsp;hours late.<ref name=NYT-1909-05-28 /> This voyage was further marred by the apparent suicide of a despondent New York attorney on 30 May. The man, headed to the spa town of [[Bad Nauheim]] in Hesse, had previously suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and was under the care of a doctor on board the ship at the time he jumped overboard.<ref>{{cite news |  format = pdf | title = Moss jumped from steamer | work = The New York Times | date = 5 June 1909 | accessdate =11 April 2008 | page = 1 }}</ref>

[[File:SS Princess Alice interned at Cebu, Philippines.jpg|thumb|left|SS ''Princess Alice'' is pictured during her internment at [[Cebu City|Cebu]], Philippines, c. 1914<U+2013>1916.]]
In May 1910, ''Princess Alice'' sailed her last North Atlantic passage for her German owners.<ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /> Put permanently on the Far East route, she plied Pacific waters for North German Lloyd until the outbreak of World War I. In late July 1914, as war spread across Europe, ''Princess Alice'' neared her destination of Hong Kong with <U+00A3>850,000 of gold from [[India]]. Rather than face seizure of the ship and her cargo by British authorities there, ''Princess Alice'' instead sped to the [[Philippines]] and deposited the gold with the German Consul at [[Manila]]. Leaving the neutral port in under 24&nbsp;hours, the ship then rendezvoused with German [[cruiser]] {{SMS|Emden|1906|2}} at [[Angaur]] before returning to the Philippines in early August and putting in at [[Cebu City|Cebu]] where she was interned.<ref name=Drechsel-v1-338 />

At the conclusion of her Army service, ''Princess Matoika'' was handed over to the {{USSB|first=long}}, who chartered the vessel to the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] for service from New York to [[Italy]].

Upon the formation of the United States Lines in August 1921, ''Princess Matoika'' and the eight other ex-German liners formerly operated by the U.S. Mail Line were transferred to the new company for operation.<ref>{{cite news | title = United States Lines will operate passenger vessels |work=The Wall Street Journal | date = 30 August 1921 | page = 8 }}</ref> The ''Princess'', still on New York<U+2013>Bremen service, sailed on her first voyage for the new steamship line on 15&nbsp;September.<ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /> In October, ''Matoika'' crewmen were reported as taking advantage of the [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|German inflation]] by consuming champagne available for $1.00 per quart and mugs of "the best beer" for an American penny.<ref>{{cite news | title = Champagne and beer add joys to U.S. sailor's life | work = Chicago Daily Tribune | date = 17 October 1921 | page = 1 }}</ref> In November, United States Lines announced that ''Princess Matoika'' would be replaced on the Bremen route in order to better compete with [[North German Lloyd]], the liner's former owner, but that never came about.<!-- See Bonsor for continuation of Bremen service --><ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /><ref>{{cite news | title = To build up Atlantic service | work = The Wall Street Journal | date = 8 November 1921 | page = 3 }}<!-- announcement--></ref> The ''Princess'' continued on runs to Bremen, calling at the additional ports of [[Cobh|Queenstown]], [[Southampton]], and [[Danzig]], as her schedule shifted from time to time.<ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 />

After four Bremen roundtrips for United States Lines, ''Princess Matoika'' had sailed her last voyage under that name.<ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /> When newly built Type&nbsp;535 vessels named for American presidents came into service for the company in May 1922, the ''Princess'' was renamed SS ''President Arthur'' in honor of the 21st [[List of Presidents of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], matching the naming style of the new ships.<ref name=Drechsel-v1-339>Drechsel, Vol. 1, p. 339</ref>

After her rename, she continued plying the North Atlantic between New York and Bremen, and was involved in a few episodes of note during this time. In June 1922, two years into [[Prohibition in the United States]], ''President Arthur'' was raided while at her dock in Hoboken, New Jersey, which netted 150&nbsp;cases of smuggled spirits. Officials involved denied reports that the raid was conducted as a legal [[Test case (law)|test case]] intended to test the determination of {{USSB}} chair [[Albert Lasker]] that United States-flagged ships could carry and sell alcohol outside the [[three-mile limit|three-mile territorial limit]] of the United States.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = American ships raided | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 28 June 1922 | page = I-1 }}</ref> Congressman [[James A.

In September, ''President Arthur'' carried [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] Muriel MacSwiney, widow of the recently deceased [[Lord Mayor of Cork]] [[Terence MacSwiney]], and Linda Mary Kearns, who had been jailed for murder under the [[Black and Tans]], to New York. Wearing buttons with pictures of [[Harry Boland]], an anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|treaty]] Irish nationalist who had been killed the previous month, the two women were there to raise funds for orphans of [[Irish Republican Army (1922<U+2013>1969)|Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces, who were then fighting in southern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news | title = Finance Collins killers | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 7 September 1922 | page = I-1 }}</ref> In October, a Hoboken man, after securing a last-minute [[court order]], was able to halt the deportation of his German niece on ''President Arthur''; she was retrieved from the ship ten minutes before sailing time.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9506E1DC1139E133A25750C1A9669D946395D6CF | format = pdf | title = Halts girl's deportation | work = The New York Times | date = 13 October 1922 | accessdate =11 April 2008 | page = 16 }}</ref>

After completion of her maiden voyage, ''City of Honolulu'' began regular service from Los Angeles to Honolulu and [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] on what {{LASSCO}} called the "Great Circle Route of Sunshine".

Throughout her career, ''City of Honolulu'' transported many notable passengers to Hawaii.

=== Fire and scrapping ===
''City of Honolulu''{{'}}s career as a tropical liner, however, was short-lived. On the afternoon of 25 May 1930, just shy of completing three years of {{LASSCO}} service, a fire broke out on her B deck while she was docked in her namesake city. Although aided by fireboat ''Leleiona'' and U.S. Navy submarine rescue ship {{USS|Widgeon|ASR-1|2}}, firefighters were unable to bring the blaze under control quickly, and it spread to {{convert|100|ST|t}} of [[potash]] aboard the liner. Fears that her cargo of {{convert|16000|oilbbl}} of oil would explode caused firefighters to intentionally sink the liner at her pier in order to help extinguish the conflagration.<ref name=LAT-1930-05-26 /> Through firefighters' efforts, the fire was contained to the upper three decks, leaving the ship's power plant relatively undamaged.<ref name=LAT-1930-06-11>{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Lassco's liner due in dry dock | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 11 June 1930 | page = 11 }}</ref> All crew members and {{LASSCO}} employees on board the ship got off safely; no passengers were on the ship at the time of the fire.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Burned liner's crew all safe | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 27 May 1930 | page = 4 }}</ref>

The ship was pumped out and raised on 9 June, and taken to the naval drydock at [[Pearl Harbor]] for inspection on 12 June.<ref name=LAT-1930-06-11 /> While remaining in Hawaii, one engine was restored to working order and the ship departed for Los Angeles under her own power on 30&nbsp;October. After her arrival, further inspections were conducted, and it was determined that repairs would be too expensive, especially given the [[Great Depression|global economic conditions]]. ''City of Honolulu'' was declared a total loss,<ref name=Drechsel-v1-339 /> and was laid up in the West Basin of Los Angeles Harbor for almost three years.<ref name=LAT-1932-12-20>{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 20 December 1932 | page = 13 }}</ref> During her lay up, fittings and fixtures stripped from the vessel were auctioned in July 1932,<ref>{{cite news | title = Steamship salvage auction... | format = display advertisement | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 31 July 1932 | page = 11 }}</ref> and in December, film crews from [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Corporation]] spent ten days filming on board the ship.<!-- no indication in refs as to what the film was.

''City of Honolulu'' was sold to Japanese [[ship breaking|shipbreakers]] in mid 1933,<ref name=LAT-1933-08-02>{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Two old liners to be scrapped | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2 August 1933 | page = 6 }}</ref> and<U+2014>in the company of {{SS|Calawaii||2}}, another {{LASSCO}} ship destined for the scrap heap<U+2014>the ''City of Honolulu'' departed Los Angeles in late August under her own power.<ref name=Drechsel-v1-339 /> Manned by a [[Philippines|Filipino]] crew,<ref name=LAT-1933-08-02 /> the 33-year-old liner developed a problem with one of her boilers almost immediately and had to put in to San Francisco for repairs. Getting underway after a lengthy delay, one of her engines failed in mid-ocean, leaving her to plod on to Japan on one engine.<ref name=LAT-1933-09-29>{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Hopes for deep fairway rise | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 29 September 1933 | page = 17 }}</ref> She eventually arrived in [[Osaka]] at the shipbreaker in mid-December, and was scrapped shortly thereafter.<ref name=Drechsel-v1-339 />
