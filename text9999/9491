'''''Fun Home''''' (subtitled ''A Family Tragicomic'') is a [[Graphic novel|graphic]] [[memoir]] by [[Alison Bechdel]], author of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Dykes to Watch out For]]''.  It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural [[Pennsylvania]], focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of [[sexual orientation]], [[gender role]]s, [[suicide]] and the role of [[literature]] in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating ''Fun Home'' took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.<ref name="tcj36">{{Citation

The memoir centers on her family but gives particular attention to Alison Bechdel's relationship with her father, Bruce.  Bruce Bechdel was a [[funeral director]] and high school English teacher in [[Beech Creek, Pennsylvania|Beech Creek]], where Alison Bechdel and her siblings grew up.

The story also deals with Alison Bechdel's own struggle with her sexual identity, culminating in the realization that she is a [[lesbian]] and her [[coming out]] to her parents.<ref name="nyt2" /><ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 58, 74<U+2013>81, </ref> The memoir frankly examines her sexual development, including transcripts from her childhood [[diary]], anecdotes about [[masturbation]], and tales of her first sexual experiences.<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 76, 80<U+2013>81, 140<U+2013>143, 148<U+2013>149, 153, 157<U+2013>159, 162, 168<U+2013>174, 180<U+2013>181, 183<U+2013>186, 207, 214<U+2013>215, 224.</ref> In addition to their common homosexuality, Alison and Bruce Bechdel share [[obsessive-compulsive]] tendencies and artistic leanings, albeit with opposing aesthetic senses: "I was [[Sparta]]n to my father's [[Athens|Athenian]].  [[Modernism|Modern]] to his Victorian.  [[Butch]] to his nelly.  Utilitarian to his [[aestheticism|aesthete]]."<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 15.</ref> This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given [[gender role]]s: "Not only were we [[sexual inversion (sexology)|inverts]], were were inversions of each other.  While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine through me.  It was a war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation."<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 98.</ref>  However, shortly before Bruce Bechdel's death he and his daughter have a conversation which is presented as a partial resolution to this conflict.<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 220<U+2013>221.</ref>

At several points in the book, Bechdel questions whether her decision to come out as a lesbian was one of the triggers for her father's suicide.<ref name="pmla" /><ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 57<U+2013>59, 86, 117, 230<U+2013>232.</ref> This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.<ref name="pmla" /><ref name="nyt2" /><ref name="velvetpark" />

===Allusions===
The allusive references used in ''Fun Home'' are not merely structural or stylistic: Bechdel writes, "I employ these allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms.  And perhaps my cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison."<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', p. 67</ref>  Bechdel, as the narrator, considers her relationship to her father through the myth of [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]].<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 3<U+2013>4, 231<U+2013>232.</ref> As a child, she confused her family and their [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] home with the [[Addams Family]] seen in the cartoons of [[Charles Addams]].<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 34<U+2013>35.</ref> Bruce Bechdel's suicide is discussed with reference to [[Albert Camus]]' novel ''[[A Happy Death]]'' and essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 27<U+2013>28, 47<U+2013>49.</ref> His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F.

She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was "a harbinger of my parents' later marriage".<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 69<U+2013>70.</ref> Helen Bechdel's role as Lady Bracknell in a local production of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' is shown in some detail; Bruce Bechdel is compared with [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 154<U+2013>155, 157<U+2013>158, 163<U+2013>168, 175, 180, 186.</ref> His homosexuality is also examined with allusion to [[Marcel Proust|Marcel Proust's]] ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.<ref>Bechdel, ''Fun Home'', pp. 92<U+2013>97, 102, 105, 108<U+2013>109, 113, 119<U+2013>120.</ref>  The father and daughter's artistic and obsessive-compulsive tendencies are discussed with reference to [[E.

In addition to the literary allusions which are explicitly acknowledged in the text, Bechdel incorporates visual allusions to television programs and other items of [[pop culture]] into her artwork, often as images on a television in the background of a panel.<ref name="glrw" />  These visual references include the film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', [[Bert and Ernie]] of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', [[Yogi Bear]], ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', the [[Wile E.

==Artwork==
''Fun Home'' is drawn in black [[line art]] with a gray-green ink [[Wash#Painting|wash]].<ref name="tcj44-48" /> Sean Wilsey wrote that ''Fun Home''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[panel (comics)|panels]] "combine the detail and technical proficiency of [[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]] with a seriousness, emotional complexity and innovation completely its own."<ref name="nyt1" />  Writing in the ''Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide'', Diane Ellen Hamer contrasted "Bechdel's habit of drawing her characters very simply and yet distinctly" with "the attention to detail that she devotes to the background, those TV shows and posters on the wall, not to mention the intricacies of the funeral home as a recurring backdrop."<ref name="glrw" />  Bechdel told an interviewer for ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' that the richness of each panel of ''Fun Home'' was very deliberate:{{quote|It's very important for me that people be able to read the images in the same kind of gradually unfolding way as they're reading the text.  I don't like pictures that don't have information in them.  I want pictures that you have to read, that you have to decode, that take time, that you can get lost in.  Otherwise what's the point?<ref>Emmert, p. 46.  Print edition only.</ref>}}

[[Image:Fun Home photoreference.jpg|right|thumb|Alison Bechdel took photographs of herself posing as each character, to use as reference in her drawing.]]
Bechdel wrote and illustrated ''Fun Home'' over the course of seven years.<ref name="tcj36" />  Her laborious artistic process made the process of illustration slow.  She began each page by creating a framework in [[Adobe Illustrator]], on which she placed the text and drew rough figures.<ref name="tcj44-48" /><ref name="7days" />  She used extensive [[Photo-referencing|photo reference]] and, for many panels, posed for each human figure herself, using a [[digital camera]] to record her poses.<ref name="tcj44-48" /><ref name="7days" /><ref name="ocd"/><ref name="velvetpark" /> Bechdel also used photo reference for background elements.
