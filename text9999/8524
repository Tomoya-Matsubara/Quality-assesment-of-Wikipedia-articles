==History==
In the late 19th century all the English language schools in the area were run by Christian missionaries.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=College History|url=http://jhc.lk/jhcnew/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=49|publisher=Jaffna Hindu College}}</ref> In 1886 Williams Nevins Muthukumaru Sithamparapillai founded ''The Native Town High School''. The school encountered financial problems and in 1889 it was taken over by S. Nagalingam who re-located it to [[Vananarponnai]]. The school was renamed ''Nagalingam Town High School''.<ref name=history/> In 1890 the school was handed over to the Jaffna Saiva (Samaya) Paripalana Sabhai.<ref name=history/> The school was moved to its present site and renamed ''The Hindu High School''.<ref name=history/>
