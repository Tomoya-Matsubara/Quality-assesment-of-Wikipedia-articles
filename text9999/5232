'''New York State Route&nbsp;635''' ('''NY&nbsp;635''') is a [[state highway]] located in the vicinity of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] in [[Onondaga County, New York]], in the United States. It extends for {{convert|2.25|mi}} along Thompson Road from an intersection with Erie Boulevard ([[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]) in Syracuse to [[Carrier Circle]] in [[DeWitt, New York|DeWitt]], where NY&nbsp;635 connects to both the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|Interstate&nbsp;90]] or I-90) and [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]]. Along the way NY&nbsp;635 also meets [[Interstate 690|I-690]]. The route was assigned in 1980 after the section of Thompson Road between [[New York State Route 290|NY&nbsp;290]] and Carrier Circle was acquired by the state of New York.

==Route description==
NY&nbsp;635 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] (Erie Boulevard) two blocks north of the campus of [[LeMoyne College]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. As Thompson Road, NY&nbsp;635 heads north and connects to [[Interstate 690|I-690]] via the full [[cloverleaf interchange]] that comprises exit&nbsp;16. Just past I-690, NY&nbsp;635 crosses over the Peat Street Runner, a [[CSX Transportation]] railroad [[branch line|spur]] that largely parallels I-690 into downtown Syracuse, prior to intersecting Burnet Avenue, a street connecting NY&nbsp;635 to the nearby village of [[East Syracuse, New York|East Syracuse]].<ref name=google>{{Google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=syracuse&ie=UTF8&ll=43.072023,-76.083069&spn=0.044767,0.11467&t=h&z=14 |title=overview map of NY 635 |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}</ref>

North of Burnet Avenue, NY&nbsp;635 narrows slightly from six lanes to four lanes with a median as it heads along the eastern edge of the [[Eastwood, Syracuse|Eastwood]] neighborhood of Syracuse. The road also acts as a divider between the residential neighborhoods of eastern Syracuse and the industrial factories situated along CSX Transportation's [[Mohawk Subdivision]] rail line in [[DeWitt, New York|DeWitt]]. This division ends upon entering DeWitt, where NY&nbsp;635 meets [[New York State Route 290|NY&nbsp;290]] at an intersection centered on a bridge over the four-track main line. From this point north to its terminus at [[Carrier Circle]], NY&nbsp;635 is surrounded completely by commercial and industrial properties, including the sprawling [[Carrier Corporation]] complex just south of the circle. At the circle, NY&nbsp;635 officially terminates upon meeting [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]]; however, it also connects to the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]) at exit&nbsp;35 by way of the loop.<ref name=google />

==History==
The segment of NY&nbsp;635 from [[New York State Route 290|NY&nbsp;290]] north to [[Carrier Circle]] was originally maintained by [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] as part of [[County Route 13 (Onondaga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;13]] (CR&nbsp;13), a discontinuous route extending from NY&nbsp;290 in [[DeWitt, New York|DeWitt]] north to Northern Boulevard in [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]] with a gap at [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]].<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[DeLorme Mapping]] |title=Upstate New York City Street Maps |edition=1st |year=1990 |cartography=DeLorme Mapping |scale=1" = 1/2 mile |page=2 |section=D1 |isbn=0-89933-300-1}}</ref> On April&nbsp;1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of the portion of CR&nbsp;13 south of Carrier Circle was transferred to the state of [[New York]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state.<ref name="law">{{cite web |author=[[New York State Legislature]] |url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS |title=New York State Highway Law <U+00A7> 341 |accessdate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> This piece of CR&nbsp;13, as well as a previously state-maintained roadway from NY&nbsp;290 south to [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]],<ref name="syracuse east quad">{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=p30 |title=Syracuse East Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1990 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> was designated NY&nbsp;635.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |title=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-528-91040-X}}</ref>
