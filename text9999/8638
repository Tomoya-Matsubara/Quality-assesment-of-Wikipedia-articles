'''Chromatophores''' are [[Biological pigment|pigment]]-containing and light-reflecting [[cell (biology)|cells]], or groups of cells, found in a wide range of animals including [[amphibian]]s, [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[bacteria]]. [[Mammal]]s and [[bird]]s, in contrast, have a class of cells called [[melanocyte]]s for [[animal coloration|coloration]].

Chromatophores are largely responsible for generating skin and [[eye color|eye colour]] in [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] animals and are generated in the [[neural crest]] during [[embryonic development]]. Mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour (more properly "[[hue]]") under white light: '''xanthophores''' (yellow), '''erythrophores''' (red), '''iridophores''' ([[reflective]] / [[iridescence|iridescent]]), '''leucophores''' (white), '''melanophores''' (black/brown), and '''cyanophores''' (blue).  The term ''chromatophore'' can also refer to coloured, membrane-associated [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] found in some forms of [[phototroph|photosynthetic bacteria]].

Some species can rapidly change colour through mechanisms that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores.

[[Giosu<U+00E8> Sangiovanni]] was the first to describe [[invertebrate]] pigment-bearing cells as ''{{lang|it|cromoforo}}'' in an Italian science journal in 1819.<ref name=chromoforo>Sangiovanni G.

{{quote| These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green. The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids.}}

== Classification ==
The term ''chromatophore'' was adopted (following Sangiovanni's ''chromoforo'') as the name for pigment-bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded [[vertebrate]]s and cephalopods. The word itself comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''{{lang|el-Latn|khr<U+014D>ma}}'' ({{lang|el|<U+03C7><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1>}}) meaning "colour," and ''{{lang|el-Latn|phoros}}'' ({{lang|el|<U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}) meaning "bearing". In contrast, the word ''chromatocyte'' (''cyte'' or {{lang|el|<U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B5>}} being Greek for "cell") was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals. Only one such cell type, the [[melanocyte]], has been identified in these animals.

It was only in the 1960s that chromatophores were well enough understood to enable them to be classified based on their appearance. This classification system persists to this day, even though the [[biochemistry]] of the pigments may be more useful to a scientific understanding of how the cells function.<ref name=Cytology>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(08)60801-3 | author=Bagnara, JT | year=1966 | title=Cytology and cytophysiology of non-melanophore pigment cells | volume=20 | issue=| pages=173<U+2013>205 | pmid=5337298 | journal=International Review of Cytology | isbn=978-0-12-364320-9 | series=International Review of Cytology }}</ref>

Colour-producing molecules fall into two distinct classes: [[Pigment (biology)|biochromes]] and [[structural coloration|structural colours]] or "schemochromes".<ref name=Fox>Fox, DL. ''Animal Biochromes and Structural Colors: Physical, Chemical, Distributional & Physiological Features of Colored Bodies in the Animal World.'' University of California Press, Berkeley, 1976. ISBN 0-520-02347-1</ref> The biochromes include true pigments, such as [[carotenoid]]s and [[pteridine]]s. These pigments selectively absorb parts of the [[visible spectrum|visible light spectrum]] that makes up white light while permitting other [[wavelength]]s to reach  the eye of the observer. Structural colours are produced by various combinations of diffraction, reflection or scattering of light from structures with a scale around a quarter of the wavelength of light. Many such structures interfere with some wavelengths (colours) of light and transmit others, simply because of their scale, so they often produce [[iridescence]], creating different colours when seen from different directions.

Whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures (except when there has been a  [[mutation]], as in [[albinism]]), not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores. [[Haem]], for example, is a biochrome responsible for the red appearance of blood. It is found primarily in [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes), which are generated in bone marrow throughout the life of an organism, rather than being formed during embryological development. Therefore erythrocytes are not classified as chromatophores.
[[File:C Calyptratus female.jpg|thumb|A [[veiled chameleon]], ''Chamaeleo calyptratus''. Structural green and blue colours are generated by overlaying chromatophore types to reflect filtered light.]]

=== Xanthophores and erythrophores ===
Chromatophores that contain large amounts of [[yellow]] pteridine pigments are named xanthophores; those with mainly [[red]]/[[orange (colour)|orange]] carotenoids are termed erythrophores.<ref name=Cytology/> However, [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell, in which case the overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments.<ref name=Xiphophorus>{{cite journal | last1=Matsumoto | first1= J| year=1965 | title=Studies on fine structure and cytochemical properties of erythrophores in swordtail, ''Xiphophorus helleri'', with special reference to their pigment granules (pterinosomes) | url=| journal=J Cell Biol | volume=27 | issue=3| pages=493<U+2013>504 | pmid=5885426 | pmc=2106771 | doi=10.1083/jcb.27.3.493}}</ref> Therefore, the distinction between these chromatophore types is not always clear.

Most chromatophores can generate pteridines from [[guanosine triphosphate]], but xanthophores appear to have supplemental biochemical pathways enabling them to accumulate yellow pigment. In contrast, carotenoids are [[metabolism|metabolised]] and transported to erythrophores. This was first demonstrated by rearing normally green frogs on a diet of [[carotene]]-restricted [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s. The absence of carotene in the frogs' diet meant that the red/orange carotenoid colour 'filter' was not present in their erythrophores. This made the frogs appear blue instead of green.<ref name=pigbook>Bagnara JT. Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Pigment Cells in Nonmammalian Tissues.

=== Iridophores and leucophores ===
Iridophores, sometimes also called guanophores, are pigment cells that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from [[guanine]].<ref name=intermedin>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0016-6480(69)90157-9 | last1=Taylor | first1=JD. | year=1969 | title=The effects of intermedin on the ultrastructure of amphibian iridophores | url=| journal=Gen Comp Endocrinol | volume=12 | issue=3| pages=405<U+2013>16 | pmid=5769930 }}</ref> When illuminated they generate iridescent colours because of the diffraction of light within the stacked plates.

A related type of chromatophore, the leucophore, is found in some fish, in particular in the [[tapetum lucidum]].  Like iridophores, they utilize crystalline [[purine]]s (often guanine) to reflect light.  Unlike iridophores, however, leucophores have more organized crystals that reduce diffraction.  Given a source of white light, they produce a [[white]] shine.  As with xanthophores and erythrophores, in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious, but, in general, iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or [[metallic colour]]s, whereas leucophores produce reflective white hues.<ref name=fish/>

=== Melanophores ===
[[File:Zebrafish embryos.png|right|thumb|At the bottom a [[mutant]] zebrafish larva that fails to synthesise melanin in its melanophores, at the top a non-mutant, wildtype larva]]
{{see also|Melanocyte}}
Melanophores contain [[eumelanin]], a type of [[melanin]], that appears [[black]] or dark-[[brown]] because of its light absorbing qualities. It is packaged in vesicles called melanosomes and distributed throughout the cell. Eumelanin is generated from [[tyrosine]] in a series of catalysed chemical reactions. It is a complex chemical containing units of [[indole|dihydroxyindole]] and dihydroxyindole-2-[[carboxylic acid]] with some [[pyrrole]] rings.<ref name=eumelanin>{{cite journal | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0749.2003.00072.x | last1=Ito | first1=S | last2=Wakamatsu | first2=K. | year=2003 | title=Quantitative analysis of eumelanin and pheomelanin in humans, mice, and other animals: a comparative review | url=| journal=Pigment Cell Res | volume=16 | issue=5| pages=523<U+2013>31 | pmid=12950732 }}</ref> The key enzyme in melanin synthesis is [[tyrosinase]]. When this protein is defective, no melanin can be generated resulting in certain types of albinism. In some amphibian species there are other pigments packaged alongside eumelanin. For example, a novel deep (wine) red-colour pigment was identified in the melanophores of [[Phyllomedusinae|phyllomedusine frogs]].<ref name=leaf>{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.182.4116.1034 | last1=Bagnara | first1=J.T. | last2=Taylor | year=1973 | first2=JD | last3=Prota | first3=G | title=Color changes, unusual melanosomes, and a new pigment from leaf frogs | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/182/4116/1034 | journal=Science | volume=182 | issue=4116| pages=1034<U+2013>5 | pmid=4748673 }}</ref> This was subsequently identified as [[pterorhodin]], a pteridine [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] that accumulates around eumelanin core, and it is also present in a variety of [[tree frog]] species from [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. While it is likely that other lesser-studied species have complex melanophore pigments, it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bagnara|first=J.T.|year=2003|title= Enigmas of Pterorhodin, a Red Melanosomal Pigment of Tree Frogs|journal=Pigment Cell Research|volume=16|pmid=12950730|issue=5|pages=510<U+2013>516|url= http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mksg/pcr/2003/00000016/00000005/art00014|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0749.2003.00075.x}}</ref>

Humans have only one class of pigment cell, the mammalian equivalent of melanophores, to generate skin, hair, and eye colour. For this reason, and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise, melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore. However, there are differences between the biology of melanophores and that of [[melanocyte]]s. In addition to eumelanin, melanocytes can generate a yellow/red pigment called [[phaeomelanin]].

=== Cyanophores ===
Nearly all the vibrant blues in animals and plants are created by [[structural coloration]] rather than by pigments. However, some types of [[mandarinfish]] do possess vesicles of a [[cyan]] biochrome of unknown chemical structure in cells named cyanophores.<ref name=fish/> Although they appear unusual in their limited taxonomic range, there may be cyanophores (as well as further unusual chromatophore types) in other fish and amphibians.

== Pigment translocation ==
[[File:Melanophores with dispersed or aggregated melanosomes.jpg|thumb|Fish and frog melanophores are cells that can change colour by dispersing or aggregating pigment-containing bodies.]]

Many species are able to translocate the pigment inside their chromatophores, resulting in an apparent change in body colour. This process, known as ''[[physiological]] colour change'', is most widely studied in melanophores, since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment. In most species with a relatively thin [[dermis]], the dermal melanophores tend to be flat and cover a large surface area. However, in animals with thick dermal layers, such as adult reptiles, dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores. These dermal chromatophore units (DCU) consist of an uppermost xanthophore or erythrophore layer, then an iridophore layer, and finally a basket-like melanophore layer with processes covering the iridophores.<ref name=DCU>{{cite journal | last1=Bagnara | first1=JT | last2=Taylor | first2=JD| year=1968 | last3=Hadley | first3=ME | title=The dermal chromatophore unit | url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/38/1/67| journal=J Cell Biol | volume=38 | issue=1| pages=67<U+2013>79 | pmid=5691979 | pmc=2107474 | doi=10.1083/jcb.38.1.67}}</ref>

Both types of melanophore are important in physiological colour change. Flat dermal melanophores often overlay other chromatophores, so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark. When the pigment is aggregated toward the centre of the cell, the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue. Likewise, after melanin aggregation in DCUs, the skin appears green through xanthophore (yellow) filtering of scattered light from the iridophore layer. On the dispersion of melanin, the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark. As the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation, animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect.<ref name=goldfish>{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/cm.970130103 | last1=Palazzo | first1=RE | last2=Lynch | first2=TJ| year=1989 | last3=Lo | first3=SJ | last4=Taylor | first4=JD | last5=Tchen | first5=TT | title=Rearrangements of pterinosomes and cytoskeleton accompanying pigment dispersion in goldfish xanthophores | url=| journal=Cell Motil Cytoskeleton | volume=13 | issue=1| pages=9<U+2013>20 | pmid=2543509 }}</ref><ref name=crayfish>{{cite journal | last1=Porras | first1= MG | last2=De Loof | year=2003 | first2=A | last3=Breuer | first3=M | last4=Ar<U+00E9>chiga | first4=H | title=Procambarus clarkii | url=| journal=Peptides | volume=24 | issue=10| pages=1581<U+2013>9 | pmid=14706537 | doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2003.08.016}}</ref>

== Background adaptation ==

{{see also|Camouflage}}

Most fish, reptiles and amphibians undergo a limited physiological colour change in response to a change in environment. This type of camouflage, known as ''background adaptation'', most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately [[mimic]] the hue of the immediate environment. It has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision-dependent (it appears the animal needs to be able to see the environment to adapt to it),<ref name=vision/> and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in colour change.<ref name=zebrafish>{{Cite journal | last1=Logan | first1=D.

}}</ref> Some animals, such as chameleons and [[Polychrotidae|anole]]s, have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly. They have adapted the capability to change colour in response to temperature, mood, stress levels, and social cues, rather than to simply mimic their environment.

== Development ==
[[File:Neural.crest.cells.migration.svg|thumb|upright|[[Cross-section (geometry)|Cross-section]] of a developing vertebrate [[torso|trunk]] showing the dorsolateral (red) and ventromedial (blue) routes of chromatoblast migration]]
During vertebrate [[embryonic development]], chromatophores are one of a number of cell types generated in the [[neural crest]], a paired strip of cells arising at the margins of the [[neural tube]]. These cells have the ability to migrate long distances, allowing chromatophores to populate many organs of the body, including the skin, eye, ear, and brain. Leaving the neural crest in waves, chromatophores take either a dorsolateral route through the dermis, entering the [[ectoderm]] through small holes in the [[basal lamina]], or a ventromedial route between the [[somites]] and the neural tube. The exception to this is the melanophores of the retinal pigmented epithelium of the eye. These are not derived from the neural crest.  Instead, an outpouching of the neural tube generates the [[optic cup (embryology)|optic cup]], which, in turn, forms the [[retina]].

When and how [[multipotent]] chromatophore precursor cells (called ''chromatoblasts'') develop into their daughter subtypes is an area of ongoing research. It is known in zebrafish embryos, for example, that by 3 days after [[fertilization]] each of the cell classes found in the adult fish<U+2014>melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores<U+2014>are already present. Studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that [[transcription factor]]s such as ''kit'', ''[[SOX genes|sox10]]'', and ''[[Microphthalmia|mitf]]'' are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation.<ref name=development>{{cite journal | doi=10.1006/dbio.2000.9840 | last1=Kelsh | first1=RN | last2=Schmid | year=2000 | first2=B | last3=Eisen | first3=JS | title=Genetic analysis of melanophore development in zebrafish embryos | journal=Dev Biol | volume=225 | issue=2 | pages=277<U+2013>93 | pmid=10985850 }}</ref> If these proteins are defective, chromatophores may be regionally or entirely absent, resulting in a [[leucistic]] disorder.

== Practical applications ==
Chromatophores are sometimes used in applied research. For example, zebrafish larvae are used to study how chromatophores organise and communicate to accurately generate the regular horizontal striped pattern as seen in adult fish.<ref name=development2>{{cite journal | last1=Kelsh | first1=RN | title=Genetics and evolution of pigment patterns in fish | journal=Pigment cell research / sponsored by the European Society for Pigment Cell Research and the International Pigment Cell Society | volume=17 | issue=4 | pages=326<U+2013>36 | year=2004 | pmid=15250934  | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0749.2004.00174.x }}</ref> This is seen as a useful [[Animal model|model]] system for understanding patterning in the [[evolutionary developmental biology]] field.

== Cephalopod chromatophores ==
[[File:Camouflage.jpg|thumb|An infant [[cuttlefish]], using background adaptation to mimic the local environment]]
[[Coleoid]] cephalopods (including octopuses, [[squid]]s and [[cuttlefish]]) have complex multicellular organs that they use to change colour rapidly, producing a wide variety of bright colours and patterns. Each chromatophore unit is composed of a single chromatophore cell and numerous muscle, nerve, [[glial cell|glial]], and sheath cells.<ref name=cephalopod1>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF00347297 | last1=Cloney | first1=RA | last2=Florey | first2=E | title=Ultrastructure of cephalopod chromatophore organs | journal=Zeitschrift fur Zellforschung und mikroskopische Anatomie (Vienna, Austria: 1948) | volume=89 | issue=2 | pages=250<U+2013>80 | year=1968 | pmid=5700268  }}</ref> Inside the chromatophore cell, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac, called the cytoelastic sacculus. To change colour the animal distorts the sacculus form or size by muscular contraction, changing its [[translucent|translucency]], reflectivity, or [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians, and reptiles in that the shape of the sacculus is changed, rather than translocating pigment vesicles within the cell. However, a similar effect is achieved.

Octopuses can operate chromatophores in complex, wavelike chromatic displays, resulting in a variety of rapidly changing colour schemes. The nerves that operate the chromatophores are thought to be positioned in the brain in a pattern similar to that of the chromatophores they each control. This means the pattern of colour change matches the pattern of [[action potential|neuronal activation]]. This may explain why, as the neurons are activated one after another, the colour change occurs in waves.<ref name=octopus>{{cite journal | doi=10.1159/000113909 | last1=Demski | first1=LS | title=Chromatophore systems in teleosts and cephalopods: a levels oriented analysis of convergent systems | journal=Brain, behavior and evolution | volume=40 | issue=2<U+2013>3 | pages=141<U+2013>56 | year=1992 | pmid=1422807  }}</ref> Like chameleons, cephalopods use physiological colour change for social interaction. They are also among the most skilled at background adaptation, having the ability to match both the colour and the [[Texture (geology)|texture]] of their local environment with remarkable accuracy.

== Bacteria ==
Chromatophores are found in membranes of [[phototroph]]ic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain [[bacteriochlorophyll]] pigments and carotenoids.<ref name=membrane>{{cite journal | last1=Salton | first1=MR | title=Bacterial membrane proteins | journal=Microbiological sciences | volume=4 | issue=4 | pages=100<U+2013>5 | year=1987 | pmid=3153178  }}</ref> In [[purple bacteria]], such as ''[[Rhodospirillum rubrum]]'', the light-harvesting proteins are intrinsic to the chromatophore membranes. However, in [[green sulfur bacteria]], they are arranged in specialised [[antenna complex]]es called [[chlorosome]]s.<ref name=sulphur>{{cite journal | last1=Frigaard | first1=NU | last2=Bryant | first2=DA | title=Seeing green bacteria in a new light: genomics-enabled studies of the photosynthetic apparatus in green sulfur bacteria and filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria | journal=Archives of Microbiology | volume=182 | issue=4 | pages=265<U+2013>76 | year=2004 | pmid=15340781  | doi=10.1007/s00203-004-0718-9 }}</ref>
