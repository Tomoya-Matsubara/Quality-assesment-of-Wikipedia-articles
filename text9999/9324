'''Jack Kerouac''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|[d<U+0292><U+00E6>k <U+02C8>k<U+025B><U+0279><U+0259>w<U+00E6>k]}}) ([[March 12]] [[1922]] &ndash; [[October 21]] [[1969]]) was an [[United States|American]]  [[novelist]], [[writer]], [[poet]], and [[artist]]. Along with [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], he is amongst the best known of the writers (and friends) known as the [[Beat Generation]].  

Kerouac's work was popular, but received little critical acclaim during his lifetime. Today, he is considered an important and influential writer who inspired others, including [[Tom Robbins]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Richard Brautigan]], and [[Ken Kesey]], and writers of the [[New Journalism]]. Kerouac also influenced musicians such as [[The Beatles]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Morrissey]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]], and [[Jim Morrison]].<ref>Hopkins, J: ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'', p. 11. Warner Books, 1980</ref> Kerouac's best-known books are ''[[On the Road]]'', ''[[The Dharma Bums]],'' ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]'', and ''[[Visions of Cody]]''.

Kerouac spent many of the years between 1947 and 1951 on the road, although he often spent extended periods at his mother's home and in the Florida home he purchased for her.   

Kerouac's search for a life worth living in the 1950's led him to experiment with drugs and to travel, not only across the North America but throughout the world. His writing is credited as [[catalyst]] for the [[1960s counterculture]] which Kerouac himself disdained. An alcoholic, the forty-seven-year-old Jack Kerouac died in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], of an [[Hemorrhage|internal hemorrhage]]. 

==Life==
Jack Kerouac was born '''Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac,''' in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] to [[French-Canadian]] parents, Leo-Alcide Kerouac and Gabrielle-Ange L<U+00E9>vesque, natives of the [[Quebec|province of Qu<U+00E9>bec]], [[Canada]]. Like many other [[Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] of their generation, the L<U+00E9>vesques and Kerouacs were part of the [[Quebec diaspora|Quebec emigration]] to [[New England]] to find employment. 

Kerouac did not start to learn [[English language|English]] until the age of six{{Fact|date=September 2007}}, and at home, he and his family spoke [[Quebec French]]. At an early age, he was profoundly affected by the death (from rheumatic fever,  age nine) of his elder brother G<U+00E9>rard, an event later described in his novel ''[[Visions of Gerard]]''. Some of Kerouac's poetry was written in French, and in letters written to friend [[Allen Ginsberg]] towards the end of his life, he expressed his desire to speak his parents' native tongue again. Recently, it was discovered that Kerouac first started writing ''[[On the Road]]'' in French, a language in which he also wrote two unpublished novels.<ref>http://www.ledevoir.com/2007/09/05/155613.html</ref>   The writings are in dialectal [[Quebec French]], and predate by a decade the first novels of [[Michel Tremblay]].

Kerouac's athletic prowess led him to become a 100 meter hurdler on his local high school track team, and his skills as a running back in American football earned him scholarship offers from [[Boston College]], [[Notre Dame]] and [[Columbia University]]. He entered [[Columbia University]] after spending a year at [[Horace Mann School]], where he earned the requisite grades to matriculate to Columbia. Kerouac broke a leg playing football during his freshman season, and he argued constantly with coach [[Lou Little]] who kept him benched.  While at Columbia, Kerouac wrote several sports articles for the student newspaper, the ''Columbia Daily Spectator''.

[[Image:Minoryulsman2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Jerry Yulsman]]'s photograph of  Kerouac and [[Joyce Johnson]] outside the Kettle of Fish Bar in [[Greenwich Village]] during the 1950s.]]
When his football scholarship did not pan out, Kerouac dropped out of Columbia, though he continued to live for a period on [[New York City]]'s [[Upper West Side]] with his girlfriend, [[Edie Parker]].  It was during this time that he met the people with whom he was later to journey around the world, the subjects of many of his novels: the so-called [[Beat Generation]], including [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Neal Cassady]], [[John Clellon Holmes]], [[Herbert Huncke]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. Kerouac joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] in [[1942]] and in [[1943]] joined the [[United States Navy]], but was honorably discharged during [[World War II]] on psychiatric grounds (he was of "indifferent disposition").<ref>http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0906052_jack_kerouac_1.html</ref>

In 1944, Kerouac was arrested as an accessory in the murder of David Kammerer, who'd been stalking Kerouac's friend [[Lucien Carr]] since Carr was a teenager in St. Louis.  (William Burroughs was himself a native of St. Louis, and it was through Carr that Kerouac came to know both Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg.)  When Kammerer's obsession with Carr turned violent, Carr stabbed him to death and turned to Kerouac for help. Together, they disposed of evidence. Advised by Burroughs to turn themselves in, Kerouac's father at first refused to pay his bail. Kerouac then agreed to marry [[Edie Parker]] if she'd pay it. Their marriage was annulled a year later, and Kerouac and Burroughs briefly collaborated on a novel about the Kammerer murder entitled ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]''. Though the book was never published, an excerpt eventually appeared in ''Word Virus: A William S. Burroughs Reader''.  Kerouac also later wrote about the murder in his novel [[Vanity of Duluoz]].  

In between sea voyages, Kerouac stayed in New York with friends  from [[Fordham University]] in [[The Bronx]].{{Fact|date=January 2007}}.  Later, he lived with his parents in the [[Ozone Park]] neighborhood of [[Queens, New York|Queens]], after they, too, moved to New York. He wrote his first novel, ''The Town and the City'' while living there. His friends jokingly called him "The Wizard of Ozone Park,"<ref>http://www.wordsareimportant.com/ozonepark.htm</ref> a spoof of [[Thomas Edison]]'s "Wizard of Menlo Park" nickname while simultaneously alluding to the title character of the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

''The Town and the City'' was published in [[1950]] under the name "John Kerouac," and, though it earned him a few respectable reviews, the book sold poorly.  Heavily influenced by Kerouac's reading of [[Thomas Wolfe]], it reflects on the generational epic formula and the contrasts of small town life versus the multi-dimensional, and larger, city. The book was heavily edited by [[Robert Giroux]]; some 400 pages were taken out.  

For the next six years, Kerouac wrote constantly but could not find a publisher. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled "The Beat Generation" and "Gone on the Road," Kerouac wrote what is now known as ''[[On the Road]]'' in April, 1951 (ISBN 0-312-20677-1). The book was largely autobiographical, narrated from the point of view of the character [[Sal Paradise]], describing  Kerouac's roadtrip adventures across the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] with [[Neal Cassady]], the model for the character of [[Dean Moriarty]]. 

Part of the Kerouac myth is that, fueled by [[Benzedrine]] and [[coffee]], he completed the first version of the novel during a three week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose. This session produced the now famous scroll of ''On the Road.'' In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor [[Mark Van Doren]], he had outlined much of the work in his journals over several years. His technique was heavily influenced by [[Jazz]], especially [[Bebop]], and later, [[Buddhism]], as well as the famous '''Joan Anderson letter''', authored by [[Neal Cassady]].<ref>http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Workshop/5083/letter3.html</ref>

Publishers rejected it due to its experimental writing style and its sympathetic tone towards minorities and marginalized social groups of the [[United States in the 1950s]]. In 1957, [[Viking Press]] purchased the novel, demanding major revisions.<ref>http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC</ref> 

In July 1957, Kerouac moved to a small house on Clouser Ave. in the College Park section of Orlando, Florida to await the release of ''On the Road''. A few weeks later, the review appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'' proclaiming Kerouac the voice of a new generation. Kerouac was hailed as a major American writer. His friendship with Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and [[Gregory Corso]], among others, became a notorious representation of the Beat Generation. His fame would come as an unmanageable surge that would ultimately be his undoing. Kerouac's novel is often described as the defining work of the post-World War II [[Beat Generation]] and Kerouac came to be called "the king of the beat generation," a term that he never felt comfortable with, and once observed, ''I'm not a beatnik, I'm a Catholic.''<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20050206191742/www.jackkerouac.com/about/quotes.htm</ref>

John Antonelli's 1985 documentary ''Kerouac, the Movie'' begins and ends with footage of Kerouac reading from ''On the Road'' and "Visions of Cody" from ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Steve Allen (comedian)|Steve Allen]] in 1957.  Kerouac appears intelligent but shy. "Are you nervous?" asks Steve Allen. "Naw", says Kerouac, sweating and fiddling.

In [[1954]], Kerouac discovered Dwight Goddard's ''A Buddhist Bible'' at the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] Library, which marked the beginning of Kerouac's immersion into [[Buddhism]]. In 1955 Kerouac wrote a biography of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], entitled ''Wake Up'', which was unpublished during his lifetime but eventually serialised in ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]'', 1993-95. 

He chronicled parts of his own experience with Buddhism, as well as some of his adventures with [[Gary Snyder]] and other [[San Francisco]]-area poets, in the book ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', set in [[California]] and published in [[1958]]. ''The Dharma Bums'', which some have called the sequel to ''On the Road'', was written in [[Orlando, Florida]] during late [[1957]] through early [[1958]]. Kerouac also wrote and narrated a "Beat" movie entitled ''[[Pull My Daisy]]'' in [[1958]].

Kerouac developed something of a friendship with the scholar [[Alan Watts]] (cryptically named Arthur Wayne in Kerouac's novel ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]'', and Alex Aums in ''[[Desolation Angels (Novel)|Desolation Angels]]''). He also met and had discussions with the famous [[Japan]]ese [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhist]] authority [[D.T. Suzuki]].

Kerouac died on [[October 21]] [[1969]] at St. Anthony's Hospital in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]], one day after being rushed with severe abdominal pain from his St. Petersburg home by ambulance. His death, at the age of 47, resulted from an internal hemorrhage (bleeding [[esophageal varices]]) caused by [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, the result of a lifetime of heavy drinking. At the time of his death, he was living with his third wife Stella, and his mother Gabrielle. Kerouac is buried in his home town of [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and was honored posthumously with a Doctor of Letters degree from his hometown's University of Massachusetts - Lowell on June 2, 2007.

In 2007, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of ''On the Road'''s publishing,<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14045410</ref> an uncensored version of ''On the Road'' will be released by Viking Press, containing text that was removed from the released version because it was deemed too explicit for 1957 audiences. It will be drawn solely from the original scroll<ref>http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2005/feb/kerouac/scroll.html</ref> and the only things not included will be things that Kerouac himself crossed out.

==Career==
Kerouac realized he wanted to be a writer before the age of ten; his father was a [[linotype|linotypist]] and ran a print shop, publishing ''The Lowell Spotlight''.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} He tended to write constantly, carrying a notebook with him everywhere. Letters to friends and family members tended to be long and rambling, including great detail about his daily life and thoughts. 

Prior to becoming a writer, he tried a varied list of careers. He was a sports reporter for ''The Lowell Sun''; a temporary worker in construction and food service; a [[United States Merchant Marine]] and he joined the [[United States Navy]] twice. Throughout all of this he led a nomadic lifestyle, never having a home of his own.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Alternatively, he lived with his mother, stayed with friends or camped out.

==Style==
Kerouac is generally considered to be the father of the Beat movement, although it must be said that he actively disliked such labels, and, in particular, regarded the subsequent [[Hippie]] movement with some disdain. Kerouac's method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of [[Jazz]], especially the [[Bebop]] genre established by [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and others. Later, Kerouac would include ideas he developed in his [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] studies, beginning with [[Gary Snyder]]. He called this style Spontaneous Prose, a literary technique akin to [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]].  

Kerouac utilized [[Ch<U+00F6>gyam Trungpa]]'s  "first-thought-best-thought" Buddhist idea,<ref name="spontaneous">{{cite book

The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from Jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and not editing a single word (much of his work was edited by Donald Merriam Allen, a major figure in Beat Generation poetry who also edited some of Ginsberg's work as well). Connected with his idea of breath was the elimination of the [[Full stop|period]], preferring to use a long, connecting dash instead. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble [[improvisation|improvisational jazz]] licks. When spoken, the words might take on a certain kind of rhythm, though none of it pre-meditated. 

[[Gary Snyder]] was greatly admired by Kerouac, and many of his ideas influenced Kerouac. ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder. One summer, Kerouac took a job as a [[fire lookout]] in the North Cascade Mountains in Washington state on Snyder's recommendation. Kerouac described the experience in his novel ''Desolation Angels''.

He would go on for hours to friends and strangers about his method, often drunk, which at first wasn't well received by Allen Ginsberg, though Ginsberg would later be one of its great proponents, and indeed was apparently influenced by Kerouac's free flowing prose method of writing in the composition of his masterpiece "[[Howl]]". It was at about the time that Kerouac wrote ''The Subterraneans'' that he was approached by Ginsberg and others to formally explicate exactly how he wrote it, how he did Spontaneous Prose. Among the writings he set down specifically about his Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise would be ''Belief and Technique for Modern Prose'', a list of thirty "essentials."

# Scribbled secret notebooks, and wild typewritten pages, for [[you|yr]] own joy 
# Submissive to everything, open, listening 
# Try never get drunk outside your own house 
# Be in love with your life 
# Something that you feel will find its own form 
# Be crazy dumbsaint of the mind 
# Blow as deep as you want to blow 
# Write what you want bottomless from bottom of the mind 
# The unspeakable visions of the individual 
# No time for poetry but exactly what is 
# Visionary tics shivering in the chest 
# In tranced fixation dreaming upon object before you 
# Remove literary, grammatical and syntactical inhibition 
# Like [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] be an old [[cannabis (drug)|teahead]] of time 
# Telling the true story of the world in interior monolog 
# The jewel center of interest is the eye within the eye 
# Write in recollection and amazement for yrself 
# Work from pithy middle eye out, swimming in language sea 
# Accept loss forever 
# Believe in the holy contour of life 
# Struggle to sketch the flow that already exists intact in mind 
# Don't think of words when you stop but to see picture better 
# Keep track of every day the date emblazoned in yr morning 
# No fear or shame in the dignity of yr experience, language & knowledge 
# Write for the world to read and see yr exact pictures of it 
# Bookmovie is the movie in words, the visual American form 
# In praise of Character in the Bleak inhuman Loneliness 
# Composing wild, undisciplined, pure, coming in from under, crazier the better 
# You're a Genius all the time 
# Writer-Director of Earthly movies Sponsored & Angeled in Heaven

Some believed that at times Kerouac's writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose. [[Truman Capote]] famously said about Kerouac's work, "That's not writing, it's typing." Despite such criticism, it should be kept in mind that what Kerouac said about writing and how he wrote are sometimes seen to be separate. According to [[Carolyn Cassady]] and other people who knew him he rewrote and rewrote. Some claim his own style was in no way spontaneous. However it should be taken into account that throughout most of the '50s, Kerouac was constantly trying to have his work published, and consequently he often revised and re-arranged manuscripts in an often futile attempt to interest publishers, as is clearly documented in his collected letters (which are in themselves wonderful examples of his style). ''The Subterraneans'' and ''Visions of Cody'' are possibly the best examples of Kerouac's free-flowing spontaneous prose method.

==Influence==
Kerouac is considered by some as the "King of the [[Beats]]". 

Kerouac's plainspeak manner of writing prose, as well as his nearly long-form haiku style of poetry have inspired countless modern neo-beat writers and artists, such as [[George Condo]] (Painter), Roger Craton (Poet and Philosopher), and [[John McNaughton]] (filmmaker). 

The [[Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]] at [[Naropa University]] is named in his honor. In 2007, Kerouac was awarded a posthumous [[honorary degree]] from the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].<ref>http://www.uml.edu/Media/PressReleases/Commencement_2007.html</ref>
