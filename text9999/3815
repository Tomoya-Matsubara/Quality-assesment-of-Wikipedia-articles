A '''flat-twin''' is a two cylinder [[internal combustion engine]] with the cylinders arranged on opposite sides of the crankshaft. It is part of the class of [[flat engine]]s, sub-type "boxer", and shares most characteristics of those engines.

==Motorcycle use==
[[BMW Motorrad]] manufactures a number of flat-twin engine motorcycles,<ref name=BMWMotorcycles>{{Cite web| url = http://www.bmwmotorcycles.com/bikes/index.jsp?bikeSection=| title = BMW Motorrad USA - Bikes| accessdate  = 2008-12-22| work = http://www.bmwmotorcycles.com/}}</ref><ref name=EncycloMoto>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Hugo|title=The Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle|year=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|language=UK English|isbn=0 7513 0206 6|pages=26<U+2013>32, 51|chapter=The A-Z of Motorcycles}}</ref> 
as do [[IMZ-Ural|Ural]] and [[Dnepr (motorcycle)|Dnepr]].
The geometry gives good [[Engine balance|primary balance]], but there is an unbalanced moment on the crankshaft caused by the pistons being offset from each other.<ref name=EncycloMoto /> 

===Engine alignment===
====Cylinders along frame====
[[Image:Flat twin Douglas 1912 N 3.jpg|thumb|Flat-twin engine in a 1912 Douglas N3, with its cylinders mounted along the frame]]
The earliest flat-twin motorcycles, including [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] in the United Kingdom, [[Helios (disambiguation)#Business .26 industry| Helios]] of Germany, and [[Harley-Davidson]] of the United States, had their cylinders aligned along the frame, and therefore with the crankshaft running transverse to the frame.<ref name=EncycloMoto /><ref name=ConsGuideBMW>{{cite book|last=Norbye|first=Jan P.|title=BMW - Bavaria's Driving Machines|year=1984|publisher=Beekman House|location=New York, NY, USA|language=|isbn=0-517-42464-9|pages=14<U+2013>17|chapter=The Origins of BMW: From Flying Machines to Driving Machines}}</ref> <ref name=HDChronicle>{{cite book |last1= Mitchel|first1= Doug|authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Harley-Davidson Chronicle|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1997|month= |origyear= |publisher= Publications International|location= Lincolnwood, Illinois, USA|isbn= 0-7853-2514-X|pages=44<U+2013>45 |chapter= The Early Years (1903-1928)|lastauthoramp=}}</ref> 
This position allowed the use of a conventional motorcycle drivetrain by belt or chain to the rear wheel.<ref name=ConsGuideBMW /><ref name="ClasMotoDoug">{{cite book|last=Willoughby|first=Vic|title=Classic Motorcycles|edition=Third impression|origyear=1975|year=1977|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group|isbn=0600318702|page=23|chapter=Douglas|separator=  |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}</ref> Another advantage of this layout is that it has a low centre of gravity.<ref name="ClasMotoDoug" /> However, in this layout, the front cylinder is more heavily cooled than the rear cylinder,<ref name=ConsGuideBMW /><ref name="ClasMotoDoug" /> and the wheelbase tends to be excessive due to the length of the engine.  The wheelbase can be reduced by placing the transmission above the rear cylinder, as done on some Douglas motorcycles.<ref name="ClasMotoDoug" />

====Cylinders across frame====
[[Image:Xa-engine.jpg|thumb|1942 [[Harley-Davidson XA]] flat-twin engine]]
In 1919, [[ABC motorcycles|ABC]] introduced a motorcycle with a flat-twin engine with the cylinders across the frame, and therefore with the crankshaft running longitudinally when referenced to the frame.  To accommodate chain drive, the ABC used a [[bevel gear|bevel drive]] at the gearbox to change the direction of the drive through ninety degrees.<ref name=EncycloMoto10>Wilson, H. ''The Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle'' p. 10  Dorling-Kindersley Limited, 1995 ISBN 0 7513 0206 6</ref>  The 1923 [[BMW R32]] used a similar engine position with a drive shaft using bevel gears to power the rear axle.<ref name=EncycloMoto />
 
This position allowed both cylinders to protrude into the airflow, providing excellent air cooling for each cylinder.<ref name=EncycloMoto /><ref name="ClasMotoDoug" />  The [[Harley-Davidson XA]], which used a flat-twin engine with the cylinders across the frame, maintained an oil temperature 100&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (56&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) cooler than a [[Harley-Davidson WLA]] with a V-twin with the cylinders in line with the frame.<ref name=AMA_XA>[http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/classics/bike.asp?id=71 AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum: 1942 Harley-Davidson XA]</ref>  

Many motorcyclists appreciate the way the cylinders in this layout provide protection to the rider in the event of a collision or fall, and keeps their feet warm in cold weather.<ref name=EncycloMoto /><ref name="ClasMotoDoug" />

A disadvantage of this layout is that it exposes the cylinders and valve covers to the danger of collision damage.<ref name=EncycloMoto /><ref name="ClasMotoDoug" />

Flat-twin engines were used in several economy cars, including the [[Citro<U+00EB>n 2CV]],  the [[Panhard Dyna X]] and [[Panhard Dyna Z|Dyna Z]], Steyr-[[Puch 500]], [[DAF Daffodil]], [[BMW 600]], several [[Jowett]] cars between World Wars I and II, and the [[Toyota Publica]] and [[Toyota Sport 800]]. Flat-twin engines were also used in several early cars, including the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] 1903-04 [[Ford Model A (1903<U+2013>1904)|Model A]], [[Ford Model C|Model C]] and [[Ford Model F|Model F]].
