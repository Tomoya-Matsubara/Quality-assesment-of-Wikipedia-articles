Mar '''Joseph II Sliba Maruf''' (or ''Youssef II Sliba Bet Macruf'') was the second incumbent of the ''Josephite'' line of [[Church of the East]], a little patriarchate in [[Full Communion]] with the [[pope]] active in the areas of [[Amid]] and [[Mardin]] in the 17th-19th century, thus being the Patriarch of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1696 to 1713.

==Life==

Sliba Maruf was born in 1667<ref name="Giga">{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.com/dioceses/diocese/baby0.htm|title=Patriarchal See of Babylon|publisher=www.gcatholic.com|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> in [[Tel Keppe<U+200E>]], [[Iraq]], received first orders at fourteen<ref name="Murre">{{cite web|url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol2No2/HV2N2Murre.html|title=The Patriarchs of the Church of the East from the Fifteenth to Eighteenth Centuries|publisher=Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies|accessdate=2009-01-24|author=Heleen H.L.

He was chosen by Joseph I as his successor in 1694, but this appointment became effective only when [[Rome]] accepted his predecessor resignation in 1696. Thus Sliba Maruf was confirmed patriarch by [[Holy See]] on June 18, 1696<ref name="Frazee"/>{{rp|209}}, with the name of Joseph II.

As happened for Joseph I, his ministry had to face the strong opposition of the traditionalists<ref name="Wilmshurst">{{cite book |last=David |first=Wilmshurst |title=The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913 |publisher=Peeters Publishers |year=2000 |isbn=9789042908765}}</ref>{{rp|26}}. This forced him in 1708 to ask permission to Rome to resign and move to [[Italy]], a request that was not granted.
