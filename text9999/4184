'''Faildergd<U+00F3>it''' (later spelled '''Faildeargdoid''' or '''Ailldeargoid'''), son of [[Muinem<U+00F3>n]], was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a [[High King of Ireland]]. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. He is said to have been the first king in Ireland whose subjects wore gold rings ([[Old Irish]] ''failge'') on their hands. He ruled for ten years before being killed, either by S<U+00ED>rna mac D<U+00E9>in, or by his successor [[Ollom Fotla]], whose father, [[F<U+00ED>achu F<U+00ED>nscothach]], had been killed by Failderd<U+00F3>it's father Muinem<U+00F3>n.<ref>R.
