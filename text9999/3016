'''Tin''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Sn''' ({{lang-la|stannum}}) and [[atomic number]] 50. This silvery, malleable [[poor metal]] that is not easily [[oxidation|oxidized]] in air and resists [[corrosion]] is found in many [[alloy]]s and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion. Tin is obtained chiefly from the [[mineral]] [[cassiterite]], where it occurs as an [[oxide]].

==Notable characteristics==   
Tin is a malleable, ductile, highly [[crystal]]line, silvery-white [[metal]]; when a bar of tin is bent, a strange crackling sound known as the "tin cry" can be heard due to the breaking of the crystals. This metal resists corrosion from [[distilled]], sea and soft [[tap water]], but can be attacked by strong [[acid]]s, [[alkali]]s, and by [[acid salt]]s. Tin acts as a [[catalyst]] when [[oxygen]] is in solution and helps accelerate chemical attack.   
    
Tin forms the dioxide SnO<sub>2</sub> when it is heated in the presence of [[air]]. SnO<sub>2</sub>, in turn, is feebly acidic and forms stannate (SnO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup>) salts with [[basic oxide]]s. Tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals in order to prevent corrosion or other chemical action. This metal combines directly with [[chlorine]] and oxygen and displaces [[hydrogen]] from dilute acids. Tin is malleable at ordinary temperatures but is brittle when it is heated.   
    
== Allotropes ==   
Tin's chemical properties fall between those of metals and non-metals, just as the semiconductors [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] do. Tin has two [[allotrope]]s at normal pressure and temperature: gray tin and white tin.    
    
Below 13.2 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]], it exists as ''gray'' or alpha tin, which has a cubic [[crystal structure]] similar to [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Gray tin has no metallic properties at all, is a dull-gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized [[semiconductor]] applications.
   
When warmed above 13.2 <U+00B0>C tin changes into ''white'' or beta tin, which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure. Converting gray tin powder into white tin produces white tin powder. To convert powdery gray tin into solid white tin the temperature must be raised above the melting point of tin.    
   
Gray tin can cause undesirable effects in applications where the metallic properties of tin are important, since metallic ''white tin'' will slowly convert to gray tin if it is held for a long time below 13.2 <U+00B0>Celsius. The metallic surface of white tin becomes covered with a gray powder which is easily rubbed off. The gray patches slowly expand until all of the tin in the object is converted from the metal to the powder, at which point it loses its structural integrity and may fall to pieces. This process is known as ''tin disease'' or ''[[tin pest]]''. Tin pest was a particular problem in northern [[Europe]] in the 18th century as [[organ pipes]] made of tin would sometimes completely disintegrate during long cold winters.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The transformation can be prevented by the addition of [[antimony]] or [[bismuth]].

==Applications==
Tin bonds readily to [[iron]], and has been used for coating [[lead]] or zinc and [[steel]] to prevent [[corrosion]]. Tin-plated [[steel]] containers are widely used for [[food preservation]], and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin. Speakers of British English call them "tins"; Americans call them "[[canning|cans]]" or "tin cans". One thus-derived use of the slang term "[[tinnie]]" or "tinny" means "can of beer". The [[tin whistle]] is so called because it was first mass-produced in tin-plated steel.

Other uses:
*Some important tin [[alloys]] are: [[bronze]], [[bell metal]], [[Babbitt metal]], [[die casting]] alloy, [[pewter]], [[phosphor bronze]], soft [[solder]], and [[White metal]].
*The most important salt formed is [[tin(II) chloride|stannous chloride]], which has found use as a reducing agent and as a [[mordant]] in the calico printing process. Electrically conductive coatings are produced when tin salts are sprayed onto [[glass]]. These coatings have been used in panel lighting and in the production of frost-free [[windshield]]s.
*Most metal pipes in a [[pipe organ]] are made of varying amounts of a tin/lead alloy, with 50%/50% being the most common. The amount of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin is the most tonally resonant of all metals.  When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead cools slightly faster and makes a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal.
*Window glass is most often made via floating molten [[glass]] on top of molten tin (creating [[float glass]]) in order to make a flat surface (this is called the "[[Pilkington process]]").
*Tin is also used in [[solder]]s for joining [[plumbing|pipe]]s or [[electric circuit]]s, in [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] alloys, in glass-making, and in a wide range of tin chemical applications.  Although of higher melting point than a [[lead]]-tin alloy, the use of pure tin or tin alloyed with other metals in these applications is rapidly supplanting the use of the previously common lead&ndash;containing alloys in order to eliminate the problems of toxicity caused by lead.
*Tin foil was once a common wrapping material for foods and drugs; replaced in the early 20th century by the use of [[aluminium]] foil, which is now commonly referred to as ''tin foil''. Hence one use of the slang term "[[tinnie]]" or "tinny" for a small retail package of a drug such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or for a can of beer.

Tin becomes a [[superconductor]] below 3.72 [[kelvin|K]]. In fact, tin was one of the first superconductors to be studied; the [[Meissner effect]], one of the characteristic features of superconductors, was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals. The [[niobium]]-tin compound [[Niobium-tin|Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn]] is commercially used as wires for [[superconducting magnet]]s, due to the material's high [[critical temperature#In Superconductivity|critical temperature]] (18 K) and critical magnetic     field (25 [[Tesla (unit)|T]]). A superconducting magnet weighing only a couple of [[kilogram]]s is capable of producing magnetic fields comparable to a conventional [[electromagnet]] weighing tons.

== History ==
Tin ([[Old English]]: ''tin'', [[Old Latin]]: ''plumbum candidum'', [[Old German]]: ''tsin'', [[Late Latin]]: ''stannum'') is one of the earliest metals known and was used as a component of [[bronze]] from antiquity. Because of its hardening effect on [[copper]], tin was used in bronze implements as early as [[3,500 BC]]. Tin mining is believed to have started in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] (esp. [[Dartmoor tin-mining|Dartmoor]]) in Classical times, and a thriving tin trade developed with the civilizations of the [[Mediterranean]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://romans.etrusia.co.uk/whyinvade.php |title=Why Claudius invaded Britain |accessdate=2007-01-12 |last=Wake |first=H. |date=2006-04-07 |format=HTML |work=Etrusia - Roman History |language=English }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://romanhistory.20m.com/project1c.htm |title=The Romano-British Amphora Trade to 43 A.D: An Overview |accessdate=2007-01-12 |last=McKeown |first=James |date=1999-01 |format=HTML |language=English }}</ref>. However the lone metal was not used until about [[600 BC]]. The last Cornish Tin Mine, at [[South Crofty]] near [[Camborne]] closed in 1998 bringing 4,000 years of mining in Cornwall to an end.

The word "tin" has cognates in many Germanic and Celtic languages. The American Heritage Dictionary speculates that the word was borrowed from a pre-Indo-European language. The later name "stannum" and its [[Romance language|Romance]] derivatures come from the lead-silver alloy of the same name for the finding of the latter in ores; the former "stagnum" was the word for a stale pool or puddle.

In modern times, the word "tin" is often improperly used as a generic phrase for any silvery metal that comes in sheets. Most everyday materials that are commonly called "tin", such as [[aluminum foil]], [[beverage can]]s, corrugated building sheathing and [[tin can]]s, are actually made of [[steel]] or [[aluminum]], although tin cans (tinned cans) do contain a thin coating of tin to inhibit rust. Likewise, so-called "tin [[toy]]s" are usually made of steel, and may or may not have a coating of tin to inhibit rust.

==Occurrence==   
About 35 countries [[mining|mine]] tin throughout the world. Nearly every continent has an important tin-mining country. Tin is produced by reducing the [[ore]] with [[coal]] in a [[reverberatory furnace]]. This metal is a relatively scarce element with an abundance in the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]] of about 2 [[part per million|ppm]], compared with 94 ppm for zinc, 63 ppm for copper, and 12 ppm for lead. Most of the world's tin is produced from [[placer mining|placer]] deposits; at least one-half comes from [[Southeast Asia]]. The only [[mineral]] of commercial importance as a source of tin is [[cassiterite]] (Sn[[oxygen|O]]<sub>2</sub>), although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex [[sulfide]]s such as [[stannite]], [[cylindrite]], [[franckeite]], [[canfieldite]], and [[teallite]]. Secondary, or scrap, tin is also an important source of the metal.   
    
[[Tasmania]] hosts some important deposits of historical importance, most importantly [[Mount Bischoff]] and [[Renison Bell]].

== Isotopes ==
Tin is the element with the greatest number of stable isotopes (ten), which is probably related to the fact that 50 is a "[[Magic number (physics)|magic number]]" of protons.  28 additional unstable isotopes are known, including the "[[Magic number (physics)#Doubly magic|doubly magic]]" tin-100 (<sup>100</sup>Sn) (discovered in 1994)<ref>{{cite journal | author=Phil Walker | title=Doubly Magic Discovery of Tin-100 | journal=PHYSICS WORLD | volume=7 | issue=June | year=1994 |url=http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&doc=7%2F6%2Fphwv7i6a24%40pwa-xml&qt= }}</ref>.

== Biologic effects of organic tin compounds==
The small amount of tin that is found in canned foods is not harmful to humans. Certain organic tin compounds, [[organotin]], such as triorganotins (see [[tributyltin oxide]]) are toxic and are used as industrial [[fungicide]]s and [[bactericide]]s.
