{{otherships|HMS Adamant}}

'''HMS ''Adamant''''' was a 50-gun [[Portland class fourth rate|''Portland''-class]] [[fourth rate]] warship of the British [[Royal Navy]]. She served during the [[American War of Independence]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in a career that spanned thirty years.

Built during the American War of Independence she spent the last three years of the war off the American coast, and saw action at the [[Battle of Cape Henry]] and at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]]. The years of peace were spent either in the Caribbean or off Nova Scotia, before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars saw her commissioned for service in the [[Leeward Islands]] and off the British coast. It was while serving in British waters that she became caught up in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|mutiny at the Nore]]. As one of only two two-decker ships to remain in action during the mutiny she had to maintain the Dutch blockade by creating the illusion of being part of a larger fleet, which she managed successfully. ''Adamant'' then went on to fight at the [[Battle of Camperdown]], after which she moved to the [[English Channel]], and then the [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Here she took part in the destruction of the French [[commerce raider]] [[French frigate Preneuse (1795)|''Preneuse'']], and in her later years captured a number of [[privateer]]s. She became a [[receiving ship]] and [[flagship]] of a [[Port Admiral (Royal Navy)|port admiral]] during the last years of the Napoleonic Wars, until being broken up in June 1814.

==Design and construction==
''Adamant'' was one of eleven ships built to a 1767 design by John Williams, and one of five ordered between 1775-6.<ref name="Winfield151">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714-1792|page=151}}</ref> She was ordered from Peter Baker, of [[Liverpool]], on 13 November 1776, and laid down on 6 September 1777.<ref name="Winfield152">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714-1792|page=152}}</ref> The ship was launched on 24 January 1780, and completed between 13 June and 12 August 1780 at [[Plymouth]].<ref name="Winfield152"/><ref name="Colledge4">{{cite book |last=Colledge |title=Ships of the Royal Navy |page=4}}</ref> Her initial cost was <U+00A3>16,313.13.10d, rising to <U+00A3>27,497.3.0d when the cost of fitting her out was included.<ref name="Winfield152"/>

==Career==
===North America===
''Adamant'' was commissioned in November 1779 under the command of Captain Gideon Johnstone, and sailed for North America on 13 August 1780.<ref name="Winfield152"/> She was with Vice-Admiral [[Mariot Arbuthnot]]'s squadron at the [[Battle of Cape Henry]] on 16 March 1781, and then at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] on 5 September 1781.<ref name="Winfield152"/> Johnstone was succeeded by Captain David Graves in February 1782, while ''Adamant'' was still in North America, after which she returned to Britain as a convoy escort in December 1782.<ref name="Winfield152"/> The ship was then paid off in April 1783 and refitted for foreign service between May and September that year.<ref name="Winfield152"/> ''Adamant'' recommissioned in June 1783 under Captain William Kelly, and on the completion of her refit, sailed to the [[Leeward Islands]] in November, where she spent the next three years as the [[flagship]] of Admiral [[Sir Richard Hughes, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Hughes]].<ref name="Winfield152"/> She was paid off again in September 1786 and underwent a great repair, followed by being fitted out as the flagship at [[Sheerness]] from August 1787 to May 1789.<ref name="Winfield152"/> ''Adamant'' was recommissioned in February 1789 by Captain David Knox, after which Admiral Hughes again hoisted his flag in her and sailed her to [[Nova Scotia]] in June.<ref name="Winfield152"/> From January 1792 the ship was under Captain Charles Hope, until returning to Britain in June that year and being paid off.<ref name="Winfield152"/>

===French Revolutionary Wars===
''Adamant'' was at first fitted for reserve duty in July 1792, but with the outbreak of war with [[Revolutionary France]] in April 1793 she was hurriedly recommissioned, at first under Captain William Bentinck and at some point in 1794 [[William Mitchell (Royal Navy officer)|William Mitchell]] was her acting-captain. From June 1794 she was under Captain [[Henry D'Esterre Darby]].<ref name="Winfield152"/> Darby took ''Adamant'' back to the Leeward Islands in September 1794, and by April 1796 ''Adamant'' was serving with [[George Vandeput]]'s squadron.<ref name="Winfield152"/> Captain Henry Warre took command in November 1796, and was succeeded by Captain [[William Hotham (1772<U+2013>1848)|William Hotham]] on 11 January 1797.<ref name="DNB413">{{cite book | chapter=Hotham, Sir William (1772-1848) | title=Dictionary of National Biography|year=1891|page=413}}</ref>

===Mutiny at the Nore, and Camperdown===
[[File:Thomas-Whitcombe-Battle-of-Camperdown.jpg|thumb|right|''The Battle of Camperdown, 11 October 1797'' by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], painted in 1798]]
''Adamant'' was based at the [[Nore]], operating in the [[North Sea]] and blockading the Dutch fleet at the [[Texel]] with Admiral [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Adam Duncan's]] fleet.<ref name="DNB413"/> In May 1797 [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|mutiny broke out]] among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at [[Spithead]] earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship {{HMS|Venerable|1784|6}}, and Hotham's crew aboard ''Adamant'' remained loyal.<ref name="GM204">{{cite book| title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|page=204}}</ref> With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, that the rest of the fleet was just over the horizon.<ref name="Tracy195">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=195}}</ref> Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port.<ref name="Tracy195"/> Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at [[Harwich]], and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.<ref name="Tracy195"/>

[[File:Preneuse-lhermitte5.jpg|thumb|left|Destruction of [[French frigate Preneuse (1795)|''Preneuse'']], depicted by [[Auguste Mayer]]]]
''Adamant'' then fought as part of Duncan's fleet at the [[Battle of Camperdown]] on 11 October 1797.<ref name="Winfield152"/> The battle was a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch, led by Admiral [[Jan Willem de Winter]], with ''Adamant'' escaping sustaining any casualties.<ref name="Winfield152"/> ''Adamant'' was then attached to [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Sir Richard Strachan's]] squadron patrolling off [[Le Havre]], after which she and Hotham were sent with a convoy to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in October 1798.<ref name="Winfield152"/><ref name="DNB413"/> While operating in the [[Indian Ocean]] ''Adamant'' and the 74-gun {{HMS|Tremendous|1784|6}}, under Captain John Osborn, encountered the French [[commerce raider]] [[French frigate Preneuse (1795)|''Preneuse'']], under Captain [[Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite]] off [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius|<U+00CE>le de France]] on 11 December 1799.<ref name="WJ2:350">{{cite book |last=James|title=Naval History of Great Britain|volume=2|page=350}}</ref> They chased her, forcing her to run ashore three miles from Port Louis, under the cover of French shore batteries. Hotham took ''Adamant'' in close, and tried to work up to the grounded frigate, coming under heavy fire from the batteries and the ''Preneuse'' as he did so.<ref name="WJ2:350"/> After a period of exchanging fire, the ''Adamant'' forced the French frigate to strike, and that evening three boats carrying men from ''Adamant'' and ''Tremendous'' approached with orders to destroy the French vessel.<ref name="WJ2:350"/> Despite coming under heavy fire from the batteries, they boarded the ship, captured the remaining French crew, including Captain l'Hermite, and removed as much of their captives' private property as they could. They then set fire to the ''Preneuse'' and returned to their ships without the loss of a single man.<ref name="WJ2:350"/> Hotham remained off South Africa and in the Indian Ocean until being recalled to Britain as an escort for a convoy in September 1801, returning on 14 December 1801.<ref name="Tracy196">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=196}}</ref>

==Napoleonic Wars==
''Adamant'' spent between May 1803 and August 1804 under repair at [[Chatham Dockyard]], before recommissioning in June under Captain George Burlton. On 13 April 1805 ''Adamant'' and {{HMS|Inflexible|1780|6}} captured the 4-gun [[privateer]] ''Alert'', and in October 1805 command passed to Captain John Stiles.<ref name="Winfield152"/> Stiles escorted a convoy of [[East Indiamen]] in 1806, and on 6 May captured the Spanish 26-gun privateer ''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Dolores'' off the Cape of Good Hope.<ref name="Winfield152"/> On 17 June 1807 he added another prize to his total, capturing the 1-gun privateer ''Bueno Union'' while serving on the [[Jamaica]] station.<ref name="Winfield152"/> Stiles was succeeded by Captain Micaiah Macbon in October 1807, and ''Adamant'' returned to the Jamaica station the following year. By early 1809 she was back in Britain, and spent the period between April and July 1809 being fitted at Chatham for service as a [[receiving ship]] at [[Leith]].<ref name="Winfield152"/> She was recommissioned in May 1809 under Captain John Sykes and in August took part in the [[Walcheren Campaign|Scheldt operations]]. Captain Matthew Buckle took command in August 1810, and remained ''Adamant''{{'}}s captain for the next three years, which she spent as flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Robert Otway]], and as a receiving ship at Leith.<ref name="Winfield152"/>  As the Napoleonic Wars drew to a close the ship was laid up in ordinary at Sheerness in 1814, and then broken up there in June 1814.<ref name="Winfield152"/>
