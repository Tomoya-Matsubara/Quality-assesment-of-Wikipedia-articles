Slackers CDs and Games was founded in 1993 by Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias in [[Columbia, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2003/06/02/newscolumn2.html | title=Slackers CD's and Games | work=St. Louis Business Journal | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from [[Saint Louis University]] using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs.<ref name="refone">{{cite web | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6941891_ITM

===Wii Controversy===
On [[December 20]], [[2007]], the store raised some controversy when [[Ars Technica]] reported that the chain was stockpiling [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]] systems to sell at a higher profit while telling retail customers that the chain did not have any systems in stock, and were not expecting any.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/12/21/slackers-employees-explain-wii-scalping-business | title=Slackers employees explain Wii scalping business | work=[[Ars Technica]] | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>  

On [[December 21]], [[2007]], Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website, saying that the article was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek stated that of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on [[eBay]] for $399.99 with a couple of units still in stock, 35 were held for specific customers and sold at the [[MSRP]], and the remainder were given away.<ref>

Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Retailer_Sold_Nintendo_Wiis_on_eBay_12215.html | title=Retailer Sold Nintendo Wiis on eBay | work=eFluxMedia | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref name="wii">{{cite web | url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/news/story/15221/retailer_sold_marked-up_wiis_on_ebay | title=Retailer sold marked-up Wiis on eBay | work=[[Digital Trends]] | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo.<ref name="wii"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slipperybrick.com/2007/12/retailer-selling-wiis-ebay/ | title=Retailer selling Wiis on eBay | work=Slippery Brick | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/5170 | title= Retail Store Accused of Scalping Nintendo Wiis on eBay | work=RealTechNews | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newslocale.org/sci%10tech/stnews/us_game_store_black-marketing_nintendo_wii_on_ebay?_20071224821.html | title=US game store black-marketing Nintendo Wii on eBay? | work=NewsLocale | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>

Slackers CDs and Games won an award for best used CD store in 2006 from the [[Riverfront Times]] for it's collection of [[vinyl record]]s and independent and rare music CDs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/bestof/2006/award/best-cd-store-used--101039/ | title=Best CD Store (Used) (2006) | work=[[Riverfront Times]] | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>

Since the store buys video games from all [[video game console|consoles]], it's known for it's extensive collection of classic titles. While the prices are considered to be fair for most of their old titles, some are considered to be too high when compared to other stores. In addition, they only require the game for [[ROM cartridge|catridge]] based games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sega-16.com/feature_page.php?id=155&title=Genesis%20Around%20the%20World:%20%20Slackers%20CDs%20and%20Games | title=Genesis Around the World: Slackers CDs and Games | work=Sega-16 | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>

The store is also known for giving more credit for trade-ins than it's competitors. In 2005, ''Vox Magazine'' had the same four games (''[[Halo]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3]]'', ''[[NHL 2004]]'', and ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'')  priced at [[EB Games]], [[Game Crazy]], and Slackers CDs and Games, with the trade-in value being $16.50, $26.82, and $45 respectively.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.voxmagazine.com/stories/2005/06/02/beat-the-system/ | title=Beat the system | work=Vox Magazine | accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>
