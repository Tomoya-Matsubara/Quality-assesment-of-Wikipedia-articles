'''Television Broadcasts Limited'''  ({{sehk|0511}},{{OTCBB|TVBCY}}), commonly known as '''TVB''', was the first over-the-air commercial [[television station]] in [[Hong Kong]]. It commenced broadcasting on 19 November 1967.<ref>The company registed on 26 July 1965 C.R. No:0011781<U+FF08>Television Broadcasts Limited<U+FF09><U+2014>[http://www.icris.cr.gov.hk/csci/ The Cyber Search Centre of the Integrated Companies Registry Information System]</ref>.  With a staff of about 4,500, it is one of two free-to-air television broadcasters in [[Hong Kong]], the other being its arch-rival, [[Asia Television Ltd|ATV]].<ref name="corp">{{cite web | title =Corporate Information  | publisher =Television Broadcasts Limited  | year = 2006 | url = http://www.tvb.com/affairs/faq/tvbgroup/tvb_e.html | accessdate = 2007-06-14 }}</ref>

TVB is the first [[free-to-air]] (FTA) television broadcaster in Hong Kong. When TVB first began broadcasting, to distinguish it from the cable television broadcaster, [[Rediffusion Television]], it was commonly known as "Wireless Television" ({{lang|zh-hk|<U+7121><U+7DAB><U+96FB><U+8996>}} [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]: mo sin din si) in Chinese, although there is more than one terrestrial television station now. The company's current chairman is Sir [[Run Run Shaw]].<ref name="corp" />

TVB currently operates five free channels in Hong Kong.'''[[TVB Jade]]''' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]) and '''[[TVB Pearl]]''' ([[English language|English]]) are TVB's flagship television channels. Under the [[digital terrestrial television]] platform, which formally commenced on 31 December 2007, '''[[TVB J2|J2]]''' and '''iNEWS''' are new channels launched with standard definition, while '''[[HD Jade]]''' is Hong Kong's One-and-Only 24-hour broadcasting channel in high definition. <ref name="dttb">{{cite web | title =Television Broadcasts Limited Provides Hong Kong's One-and-Only Free 24-Hour High Definition Channel | publisher = TVB  | date = 2007-12-12 | url = http://www.tvb.com/affairs/faq/press/20071212_e.html | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref><ref name="HDTV">{{cite web | title =Picture imperfect | publisher = [[The Standard]]  | date = 11/06/2007 | url = http://www.finance.thestandard.com.hk/chi/money_news_view.asp?aid=46477 | accessdate =  2007-11-06 }}</ref> TVB currently provides twelve [[pay-tv]] channels for its associated company, [[TVB Pay Vision]] Limited. 

TVB reaches out to the [[overseas Chinese]] communities. Its productions are available in [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]], the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Republic of Ireland]],  [[New Zealand]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]], among others, on channels such as TVB's own [[TVBS-Europe]][http://www.chinese-channel.co.uk/] subscription satellite service.<ref name="TVBI">{{cite web | title =Corporate Info | publisher = TVBI Company Limited  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.tvb.com/tvbi/corpinfo.htm | accessdate =  2007-11-06 }}</ref> In Taiwan, TVB operates through its [[TVBS]] subsidiary.

Many of Hong Kong's film and pop stars started their careers at the station through drama series produced by TVB. Special TVB events such as the annual ''TVB Anniversary Celebration'' are broadcast to planetary audience. TVB also runs talent programmes such as the annual [[Miss Hong Kong]] and [[Miss Chinese International]] [[beauty pageant]]s. Successful contestants may be offered TVB's contracts and represent Hong Kong to take part at world-class beauty contests, including the [[Miss World|Miss World Pageant]].

==Development==
TVB dominates most of the television market in Hong Kong, but it is not considered the powerhouse it used to be. It started in 1965 as a competitor to what was then called [[Rediffusion Television]], later to become ATV, a cable operator that charged subscription fees for its operation, and the only terrestrial competitor to TVB One of the first show launched was [[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]] in 1967.

TVB receives praise for its programming from a wide range of demographics, including the middle class, as was the case with its 2004 historical drama series ''[[War and Beauty]]''. Its programme line-up features a steady stream of soap operas, variety shows and other populist fare. 

TVB has been criticised for signing exclusive contracts with many local celebrities which restrict them from appearing on other local television stations. Hong Kong's Cable T.V. claims it is unfair competition (although [[Asia Television Ltd]], another major television station in Hong Kong, disagrees). In fact, many artists do not have exclusive contracts with TVB and are free to show up in programmes produced by other local television stations or out-sourcing production houses.

The annual TVB Music Awards ceremony is one of the biggest for [[Cantopop]] personalities. It is widely rumoured that TVB distributes the awards to those who are obedient to the company's demands, and the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)]] has investigated the arrangement of the awards.<ref>{{cite web | title =Stars arrested over 'rigged' awards | publisher = BBC  | year = 2004 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3073679.stm | accessdate =  2007-11-06 }}</ref> It ruled that three TVB staff members under scrutiny were not guilty. Afterwards, TVB reformed its music programmes in a bid to reestablish their authority.<ref>{{cite web | title ={{lang|zh-hk|<U+821E><U+5F71><U+884C><U+52D5><U+7D42><U+6B62><U+3000><U+4F55><U+9E97><U+5168><U+66FE><U+570B><U+5F37><U+9673><U+5BB6><U+502B><U+6176><U+6E05><U+767D>}} (in simplied Chinese) | publisher = {{lang|zh-hk|<U+91D1><U+7F8A><U+7DB2>}}  | date = 21/1/2005 | url = http://www.ycwb.com/gb/content/2005-01/21/content_837170.htm | accessdate = 11/06/2007 }}</ref>

On the other hand, TVB was awarded the [[National Association of Broadcasters]]'s (NAB) International Broadcasting Excellence Award in 2001. The award recognised the company's outstanding contributions to the community through a wide range of charitable programmes and activities. Hong Kong thus becomes the first city in Asia to receive this prestigious award in this area.<ref name="corp" /><ref>{{citeweb|title=NAB        International Broadcasting Excellence Award| publisher=National Association of Broadcasters|url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=International&Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=3545| accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

In 2005, TVB, in association with the [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]], organised the biggest fundraising campaign in the company's history in response to South-East Asia's recent tsunami. It raised over one hundred million [[Hong Kong Dollar|Hong Kong dollars]] to assist those affected.

From 31 March 2008, TVBS-Europe launched their "Multi-channel" package in Europe. It consists of 5 different channels which include the existing TVBS-Europe Channel plus the addition of TVBN, TVB Entertainment News, TVB Classic and TVB Lifestyle.<ref>[http://www.chinese-channel.co.uk/en/event_1_info.php?id=116 Chinese Channel Home Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Image:Tvbcity-s1.png|200px|thumb|[[TVB City]] in [[Tseung Kwan O]]]]
TVB was originally located on [[Broadcast Drive]] in [[Kowloon Tong]], and was neighbours with [[RTHK]] and [[Asia Television Ltd|ATV]]. By the late 1980s, the company had out-grown the facility at Broadcast Drive, and built a new studio complex, named T.V. City, at 220 [[Clear Water Bay]] Road in [[1986]].<ref>[ShawMovieTown Shaw Brothers History]</ref> The first TVB City was in fact the old Shaw Movie Town complex used by [[Shaw Brothers]] since 1958. The old Broadcast Drive headquarters was later converted into [[apartment]]s. The first TVB City is now used by [[Celestial Pictures]].

To cope with future development and expansion, TVB began planning in 1998 to develop a replacement facility at the [[Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate]]. The new HK$2.2 billion TVB City came into full operation in October 2003. The new headquarters are built on by far the largest piece of land ever leased by the then Hong Kong Industrial Estates Corporation and the first service-providing company in the area. It has a building area of over 110,000 square metres, 30% more than that of the previous facilities at Clear Water Bay. Studio 1 in [[TVB City]], which can seat an audience of six hundred and thirty, is the largest television production studio among commercial television stations in Asia.<ref>{{cite web | title =Grand Opening of Television Broadcasts Limited's TVB City A Significant Milestone of the Broadcasting and Production Industry in Hong Kong | publisher = TVB  | date =  2003-12-10 | url = http://www.tvb.com/affairs/faq/press/20031012_e.html | accessdate =  2007-11-06}}</ref>

==Criticism==

In 2009, TVB drew criticism on internet forums when its news department lightly dabbed the issue on 4th June Incident during the 20th Anniversary of the event. This was seen as a deliberate act to gain the favor of the Chinese Central Government, and to make their programming more acceptable by Chinese censors. Many mocked TVB that it had become "[[China Central Television|CCTVB]]". TVB is also criticised for not reporting news that may harm their own interests, such as the mid-term review of both aTV's and TVB's broadcast licensing.

The standard of TVB's entertainment programmes, from soap operas to games shows, have also been criticised to be of reducing quality. Soap operas reflect less and less of the lives of the average Hong Kong citizen, and game shows are said to resort to the use of bad language and borderline eroticism, wastage of food and resources, and polluting the minds and children and adolescents.

TVB has also been criticised for being a copycat, copying many elements from the more successful shows on aTV, sometimes even copying the entire format of a show, such as [[Hong Kong Today]], with which TVB made [[Focus on Focus]].
