The '''Rio Grande Valley Giants''' was a [[minor league baseball]] franchise in the Double-A [[Texas League]] located in [[Harlingen, Texas]], USA, from the beginning of the [[1960 in baseball|1960]] season through June 10, 1961. As its nickname implies, the team was affiliated with the [[San Francisco Giants]].

The Texas League underwent a massive face lift in the late 1950s after three of its top franchises <U+2014> [[Dallas Rangers|Dallas]], [[Fort Worth Cats|Fort Worth]] and [[Houston Buffaloes|Houston]] <U+2014> moved up to the Triple-A [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] for the [[1959 in baseball|1959]] season.

The [[Corpus Christi Giants]], which joined the TL in [[1958 in baseball|1958]], finished last in attendance (61,500) in 1959, and transferred to Harlingen over the winter. Harlingen had been represented in numerous lower-level minor leagues, most recently the [[Big State League (1947-1957)|Big State League]] (1954-55).

In 1960, the Rio Grande Valley club won the regular-season pennant and finished third in attendance (75,000) in the six-team league. But the following season, a poor club on the field resulted in a severe attendance decline, and the Giants moved to [[Victoria, Texas]], in mid-June. Harlingen has since had clubs in the [[Gulf States League]] and the [[Lone Star League]] of the 1970s and in independent leagues since 1994.
