Many Native Americans served in the Union and Confederate military during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="aa"/> The [[Delaware tribe]] had a long history of allegiance to the U.S. government, despite removal to the Wichita Indian Agency in Oklahoma and the Indian Territory in Kansas.<ref name="aa"/> On October 1, 1861 the Delaware people proclaimed their alliance to the Union.<ref name="aa"/> During the war 170 out of 201 Delaware men volunteered in the Union Army. A journalist from ''Harper's Weekly'' described them as being armed with tomahawks, scalping knives, and rifles.<ref name="aa"/>

In January 1862, [[William Dole]], U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, asked Native American agents to "engage forthwith all the vigorous and able-bodied Native Americans in their respective agencies."<ref name="aa"/> The request resulted in the assembly of the 1st and 2nd Indian Home Guard.<ref name="aa"/> Many Native American tribes fought in the war including: the [[Delaware tribe|Delaware]], [[Creek tribe|Creek]], [[Cherokee]], [[Seminole]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Seneca Nation|Seneca]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Shawnee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Lumbee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Iroquois]], [[Powhatan]], [[Pequot]], [[Ojibwe|Ojibwe (Chippewa)]], [[Huron tribe|Huron]], [[Odawa people|Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Catawba tribe|Catawba]], and [[Pamunkey]].

Stand Watie, along with a few Cherokee, sided with the Confederate Army, in which he was made Colonel and commanded a battalion of Cherokee.<ref name="aa"/> Reluctantly, on October 7, 1861, Chief Ross signed a treaty transferring all obligations due to the Cherokee from the U.S. Government to the Confederate States.<ref name="aa"/> In the treaty, the Cherokee were guaranteed protection, rations of food, livestock, tools and other goods, as well as a delegate to the Confederate Congress at Richmond.<ref name="aa"/> In exchange, the Cherokee would furnish ten companies of mounted men, and allow the construction of military posts and roads within the Cherokee Nation. However, no Indian regiment was to be called on to fight outside Indian Territory.<ref name="aa"/> As a result of the Treaty, the 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles, led by Col. John Drew, was formed. Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 7<U+2013>8, 1862, Drew's Mounted Rifles defected to the Union forces in Kansas, where they joined the Indian Home Guard. In the summer of 1862, Federal troops captured Chief Ross, who was paroled and spent the remainder of the war in Washington and Philadelphia proclaiming Cherokee loyalty to the [[Union army]].<ref name="aa"/>

In his absence, Col. Stand Watie was chosen principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. He immediately drafted all Cherokee males aged 18<U+2013>50 into Confederate military service.<ref name="aa"/> Watie was a daring cavalry rider who was skilled at hit-and-run tactics. He was considered a genius in guerrilla warfare and the most successful field commander in the Trans-Mississippi West.<ref name="aa"/> Promoted to brigadier general in May 1864, Watie was placed in charge of the Indian Cavalry Brigade, which was composed of the 1st and 2nd Cherokee Cavalry and battalions of Creek, Osage and Seminole. He achieved one of his greatest successes at [[Pleasant Bluff, Arkansas]] on June 10, 1864, capturing the Union steamboat ''J.R. Williams''. which was loaded with supplies valued at $120,000. At the Second Battle of Cabin Creek, (Indian Territory), Watie's cavalry brigade captured 129 supply wagons and 740 mules, took 120 prisoners, and left 200 casualties.<ref name="aa"/> The Cherokee who had not been removed were also caught in the middle of the Civil War. Some chose to side with the Confederate Army since they were located in the southern states.<ref name="aa"/>

The Thomas Legion, an Eastern Band of Confederate Cherokee, led by Col. William Holland Thomas, fought in the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina.<ref name="aa"/> Another 200 Cherokee formed the Junaluska Zouaves.<ref name="aa"/> Nearly all [[Catawba tribe|Catawba]] adult males served the South in the 5th, 12th and 17th South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, Army of Northern Virginia.

During the Civil War, there was no distinction made when a Native American joined the U.S. Colored Troops.

The most famous Native American unit in the Union army in the east was Company K of the 1st Michigan Sharpshooters.<ref name="aa"/> The bulk of this unit was Ottawa, Delaware, Huron Oneida, Potawami and Ojibwe.<ref name="aa"/> They were assigned to the Army of the Potomac just as Gen.

The Cherokee Nation was the most negatively affected of all Native American tribes during the Civil War, its population declining from 21,000 to 15,000 by 1865. Despite the Federal government's promise to pardon all Cherokee involved with the Confederacy, the entire Nation was considered disloyal, and their rights were revoked. At the end of the war, Gen.

[[File:Lincoln-Warren-1865-03-06.jpeg|thumb|200px|upright|The last known high-quality photograph of Lincoln, taken March 1865]]

The west was mostly peaceful during the war due to the lack of U.S. occupation troops.  The federal government was still taking control of native land, and there were continuous fights.<ref name="ac"/>  From January to May 1863, there were almost continuous fights in the New Mexico territory, as part of a concerted effort by the Federal government to contain and control the [[Apache]]; in the midst of all this, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] peacefully met with representatives from several major tribes, and informed them he felt concerned they would never attain the prosperity of the white race unless they turned to farming as a way of life.<ref name="aa"/> The fighting led to the [[Sand Creek Massacre]] caused by Colonel J. M. Chivington, whom settlers asked to retaliate against natives.<ref name="ac"/>  With 900 volunteer militiamen, Chivington attacked a peaceful village of some 500 or more Arapaho and Cheyenne natives, killing women and children as well as warriors.<ref name="ac"/> There were few survivors of the massacre.<ref name="ac"/>

In July 1862, settlers fought against Santee Sioux in Minnesota.<ref name="ac"/><ref name="ad">{{cite web |title=Native Americans|url=http://www.historycentral.com/civilwar/people/Native.html|date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2009-01-05|publisher=History Central.com|author=}}</ref> Because the war absorbed so many government resources, the annuities owed to the Santee Sioux in Minnesota were not paid on time in the summer of 1862.<ref name="ad"/> In addition, Long Trader Sibley refused the [[Santee Sioux]] access to food until the funds were delivered. In frustration, the Santee Sioux, led by Little Crow (Ta-oya-te-duta), attacked settlers in order to get supplies.<ref name="ad"/> After the [[Sioux]] lost the fighting, they were tried (without defense lawyers), found guilty on flimsy evidence,and many were sentenced to death.<ref name="ad"/>

When President Lincoln found out about the incident, he immediately requested full information about the convictions.  He assigned two attorneys to examine the cases and differentiate between those guilty of murder and those who simply engaged in battle.<ref name="ad"/>  General Pope, as well as Long Trader Sibley, whose refusal to allow the Sioux access to food had been largely responsible for the war, were angered by Lincoln's failure to immediately authorize the executions.<ref name="ad"/> They threatened that the local settlers would take action against the Sioux unless the President allowed the executions, and they quickly tried to push forward with them.<ref name="ad"/> In addition, they arrested the rest of the Santee Sioux, 1,700 people, of whom most were women and children, although they were accused of no crime.

On December 6, 1861, based on information he was given, Lincoln authorized the execution of 39 Sioux, and ordered that the others be held pending further orders, "taking care that they neither escape nor are subjected to any unlawful violence."<ref name="ad"/>  On December 26, 39 men were taken. At the last minute, one was given a reprieve.  It was not until years later that information became public that two men were executed who had not been authorized for punishment by President Lincoln.<ref name="ad"/> In fact, one of these two men had saved a white woman's life during the fighting.<ref name="ad"/>  [[Little Crow]] was killed in July 1863, the year in which the Santees were transported to a reservation in Dakota Territory.<ref name="ad"/>

In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the [[Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws]] conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, [[Confederate States of America]] citizenship possibilities, and a entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Seminole]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side.

Choctaw [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] battalions were formed in Indian Territory and later in Mississippi in support of the southern cause. The Choctaws, who were expecting support from the Confederates, got little. Webb Garrison, a Civil War historian, describes their response: when Confederate Brigadier General [[Albert Pike]] authorized the raising of regiments during the fall of 1860, Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees responded with considerable enthusiasm. Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them. A disgusted officer later acknowledged that "with the exception of a partial supply for the Choctaw regiment, no tents, clothing, or camp and garrison equippage was furnished to any of them."<ref name=webb_garrison>
