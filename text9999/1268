The '''Eider-Treene Depression''' ({{lang-de|Eider-Treene-Niederung}}; {{lang-da|Ejder-Trene-S<U+00E6>nkningen}}) is a landscape in west [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in [[North Germany]]. It covers {{convert|500|km2|sqmi}} around the rivers [[Eider]], [[Treene]] and [[Sorge]].
The Eider-Treene Depression is the largest [[wetland]] in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. It includes one third of the moorland (bog) in the state and is a habitat to the largest inland group of meadow birds.
To the north, its border runs between [[Hollingstedt]] and [[Treia, Germany|Treia]], to the east near [[Rendsburg]], to the south the boggy depression reaches to the Hanerau and [[Haalerau]] beyond the [[Kiel Canal]]. Its western boundary with the Eiderstedt Marsh is unclear as [[marsh]], bog and [[Geest (topography)|geest]] are interspersed. The region comprises the river valleys and their interfluvial geest ridges (''Geestkernen''). The landscape was formed during the [[ice ages]], and altered by man as a result of dams and weirs built across the Eider, which was still a tidal river as far as Rendsburg until the 1920s. The region recently is encouraging "nature tourism" with walking, riding, cycling and canoe trips.
