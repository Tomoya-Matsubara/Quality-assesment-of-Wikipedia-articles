The '''Canadian Human Rights Commission''' was established in [[1977]] by the government of [[Canada]]. It is empowered under the ''[[Canadian Human Rights Act]]'' to investigate and try to settle complaints of discrimination in employment and in the provision of services within federal jurisdiction. The CHRC is also empowered under the ''[[Employment Equity]] Act'' to ensure that federally regulated employers provide [[equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] for four designated groups: women, [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] people, the disabled and visible minorities. The CHRC also acts as an advocate for human rights and issues reports on various aspects of discrimination as well as educational materials designed to promote human rights and inform employers and the general public about human rights regulations. The Commission also sponsors research into human rights and makes policy recommendations. 

The Commission is composed of eight commissioners. The Chief Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner are appointed for terms not exceeding seven years while other commissioners are appointed for three year terms. 

Jennifer Lynch was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission in March 2007.

The daily work of the Commission is carried out by a staff of approximately 200 people.

The Commission investigates complaints, attempts to facilitate a resolution between the parties if appropriate and refers matters for which a resolution cannot be found to the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] which holds hearings and hands down rulings. Where appropriate, the CHRC may a prosecutorial role in Canadian Human Rights Tribunal much like a [[Crown Attorney]]. [http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/about/index_e.asp]
