'''Magdalena "Lena" Neuner''' (born 9 February 1987) is a [[Germans|German]] professional [[biathlon|biathlete]]. She started biathlon when she was nine years old and won five junior world championship titles from 2004 to 2006. Neuner made her debut in the [[Biathlon World Cup]] in 2006 and won her first World Cup race in January 2007. One month later, she claimed three gold medals at her first appearance at the [[Biathlon World Championships 2007|Biathlon World Championships]]. In the [[2007-08 Biathlon World Cup|2007<U+2013>08 season]], Neuner<U+2014>at the age of 21<U+2014>became the youngest Overall World Cup winner in the history of the [[International Biathlon Union]] (IBU). At the [[Biathlon World Championships 2008|2008 World Championships]], she again won three titles, becoming the youngest six-time world champion. After a less successful  [[2008-09 Biathlon World Cup|2008<U+2013>09 season]], Neuner participated in her first [[Winter Olympic Games]] in 2010, winning the gold medal in both the [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics <U+2013> Women's pursuit|pursuit]] and the [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics <U+2013> Women's mass start|mass start]] and silver in the [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics <U+2013> Women's sprint|sprint race]].

As of February 2010, Neuner has won 18 World Cup races and has achieved 32 podium finishes. As part of the German World Cup team, she has also won seven relay races and one mixed relay event. During three appearances at the Biathlon World Championships, Neuner has claimed six gold medals and one silver medal. In addition, she has won seven junior world championship titles. Neuner has established herself as one of the fastest [[cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]] in biathlon, but she is also noted for her volatile shooting performances in the standing position, often at the expense of better results.

Neuner has lived in the [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Wallgau]] since birth. At the age of 16, she joined the German Customs Administration to become a member of the government-funded Customs-Ski-Team. After winning three world championship gold medals in 2007, Neuner emerged as one of her home country's most popular female athletes and was named [[German Sportspersonality of the year|German Sportswoman of the Year]] in 2007.

Her rifle has advertising on its side, while snow falls in the background. |Neuner shooting at the World Cup in [[Trondheim]], March 2009.]]

As of February 2010, Neuner has a career shooting accuracy of 76%. Her career average in the prone position is 87%, while her career average in the standing position is 65%. Her shooting results in the prone position are similar to other top contenders; however, her standing position percentage is well below average in the female World Cup field.<ref name="IBUprofile"/>

With a 78% accuracy, Neuner had her best shooting results during her [[2005-06 Biathlon World Cup|2005<U+2013>06]] debut. Her average dropped to 74% in her first complete season in [[2006-07 Biathlon World Cup|2006<U+2013>07]]. Although she improved to a 76% average during the [[2008-09 Biathlon World Cup|2008<U+2013>09 season]], she merely ranked 78th out of 113 competitors that year. Neuner won the [[2007<U+2013>08 Biathlon World Cup]] with a shooting accuracy of 73%, which is the lowest result for an Overall World Cup winner ever and roughly ten per cent below the previous three winners' averages: [[Andrea Henkel]] (84%),<ref>International Biathlon Union.

IBU Datacenter. Accessed 3 February 2010.</ref> In the standing position, Neuner achieved her career best result in the 2008<U+2013>09 season: a 66% shooting average.

Neuner's shooting performances have been a regular topic in the German media. At times she has been reluctant to discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem.<ref name="pleiten"/> She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates.<ref>Janz, Thomas & Kunze, Fabian.
