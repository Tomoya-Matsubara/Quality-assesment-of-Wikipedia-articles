For the AQA Anthology at A-level see [[AQA Anthology (A-level)]].

The '''AQA Anthology''' is a collection of poems and short texts which are studied in English schools for [[GCSE]] English and  English Literature. The anthology is split into several sections covering poems from other cultures, the poetry of [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Gillian Clarke]], [[Carol Ann Duffy]] and [[Simon Armitage]], and a bank of pre-1914 poems.  There is also a section of prose pieces, which may be studied in schools that have chosen not to study a separate set text.
