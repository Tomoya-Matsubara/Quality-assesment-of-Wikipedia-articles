'''USS ''Salem'' (CM-11)''' was a commercial cargo ship, that served as a [[minelayer]] and then [[net laying ship]] of the United States Navy during World War II.

The ship was built in 1916 by [[William Cramp and Sons]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], as SS ''Joseph R. Parrott''; was acquired by the [[U.S. Navy]] on 8 June 1942 from the [[Maritime Commission]]; and commissioned on 9 August 1942, Lt. Comdr. Henry G. Williams in command.

==Service history==
=== Invasion of North Africa ===
Following training exercises, ''Salem'' departed [[Brooklyn, New York]], on 13 November 1942, as part of a [[convoy]], and arrived at [[Casablanca]] on 1 December. She laid 202 mines off that port on 27 and 28 December and helped fight off an [[airstrike|air raid]] there on 31 December. On 20 January 1943, she sailed from Casablanca and arrived at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 9 February. 

=== Invasion of Italy ===
After repairs, she left the [[United States]] again on 13 June and arrived at [[Oran]] on 5 July. The minelayer got underway the next day as part of the [[Sicily]] invasion force; and, on 11 July, laid 390 mines off [[Gela]], Sicily, in company with {{USS|Weehawken|CM-12|3}} and {{USS|Keokuk|CM-8|3}}. Returning to Oran on 17 July, ''Salem'' subsequently carried 255 British troops from [[Gibraltar]] to Oran and then moved to [[Bizerte]] in preparation for landings in [[Italy]]. However, her role in these landings was cancelled due to the Italian surrender. The ship left [[Mers el Kebir]] on 7 October and returned to [[New York]] on 26 October. 

=== Pacific Theatre operations ===
''Salem'' was repaired at Norfolk, Virginia, and carried out local operations along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast until 11 May 1944, when she departed [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], for duty with Service Squadron 6 in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. On 27 June, she sailed from [[Pearl Harbor]] with a cargo of [[ammunition]], which she offloaded to shore facilities and combatant ships after her arrival at [[Eniwetok]] on 8 July. She then shuttled between Eniwetok, [[Kwajalein]], [[Makin (islands)|Makin]], [[Majuro]], [[Saipan]], and [[Tinian]], helping to carry ammunition to forward areas for issue to the fleet. At Tinian on 4 October, her stern touched bottom in heavy swells, damaging both screws, and {{USS|Sirius|AK-15|3}} and an Army tug towed her back to Pearl Harbor. After arrival on 5 November, she underwent repairs and temporary conversion into a net cargo ship. 

=== Conversion to net cargo ship ===
''Salem'' completed conversion on 10 February 1945 and departed Pearl Harbor on 18 February with a cargo of anti-[[torpedo]] nets. After stops at Eniwetok, [[Ulithi]], and [[Leyte]], ''Salem'' arrived off [[Kerama Retto]] on 26 March 1945 as troops went ashore to secure the island and its harbor for use as a fleet base for the invasion of [[Okinawa]]. During the next two days, ''Salem'' laid [[antisubmarine]] nets to protect the harbor. 

=== Frequent air attacks ===
[[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] air attacks were frequent; and, on 2 April, ''Salem's'' gunners helped shoot down a plane that was trying to crash into {{USS|Lunga Point|CVE-94|3}}. ''Salem'' departed Kerama Retto two days later and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 April, where she picked up a new cargo of nets. Departing Pearl Harbor on 24 May, she unloaded her nets at [[Guam]] between 12 and 19 June, and then proceeded to Eniwetok where she repaired nets between 24 June and 31 July. 

=== Renamed ===
''Salem'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 August, and on 15 August, the day fighting stopped in the Pacific, was renamed as USS ''Shawmut'' to permit a new cruiser to be named {{USS|Salem|CA-139|6}}.

=== End-of-War deactivation ===
Departing Pearl Harbor on 31 August, she arrived at [[San Francisco, California]], on 10 September for inactivation. ''Shawmut'' was decommissioned on 6 December 1945, struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 3 January 1946, and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 20 June 1946. She was sold on 7 March 1947 to the [[West India Fruit and Steamship Company]], and served as {{SS|Joseph R. Parrott}} under the [[Honduras|Honduran]] flag until 1970.

== Awards ==
''Salem'' (CM-11) received two [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service.
