'''Brooms''' are a group of [[evergreen]], semi-evergreen, and [[deciduous]] [[shrub]]s in the subfamily [[Faboideae]] of the [[legume]] family [[Fabaceae]], mainly in the three genera  '''''Chamaecytisus''''', '''''Cytisus''''' and '''''Genista''''', but also in five other small [[Genus|genera]] (see box, right). All genera in this group are from the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Genisteae]] (syn. Cytiseae). These genera are all closely related and share similar characteristics of dense, slender green stems and very small [[Leaf|leaves]], adaptations to dry growing conditions. Most of the species have yellow [[flower]]s, but a few have white, orange, red, pink or purple flowers. 

Two other close relatives are [[Gorse|''Ulex'']] (gorse) and ''[[Laburnum]]'' (laburnum), but these differ more strongly in appearance from the brooms. Some botanists include ''Podocytisus caramanicus'' in the genus ''Laburnum''. 

All the brooms and their relatives (including ''Laburnum'' and ''Ulex'') are natives of [[Europe]], north [[Africa]] and southwest [[Asia]], with the greatest diversity in the [[Mediterranean]] region. Many brooms (though not all) are fire-climax species, adapted to regular stand-replacing fires which kill the above-ground parts of the plants, but create conditions for regrowth from the roots and also for [[germination]] of stored seeds in the soil.

==Species of broom==
The most widely familiar is '''common broom''' (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'', syn. ''Sarothamnus scoparius''), a native of northwestern [[Europe]], where it is found in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils. Like most brooms, it has apparently leafless stems that in spring and summer are covered in profuse golden-yellow flowers. In late summer, its pea-pod like seed capsules burst open, often with an audible pop, spreading seed from the parent plant. It makes a shrub about 1<U+2013>3m tall, rarely to 4m. It is also the hardiest broom, tolerating temperatures down to about -25<U+00B0>C.

The largest species of broom is '''Mount Etna broom''' (''[[Genista aetnensis]]''), which can make a small tree to 10m tall; by contrast, some other species, e.g. '''dyer's broom''' ''[[Genista tinctoria]]'', are low sub-shrubs, barely woody at all.

Brooms are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species <U+2013> see [[list of Lepidoptera which feed on broom]].

==Cultivation==
Brooms tolerate (and often thrive best in) poor soils and growing conditions. In cultivation they need little care, though they need good drainage and perform poorly on wet soils. 

They are widely used as ornamental landscape plants and also for [[Land reclamation|wasteland reclamation]] (e.g. [[tailings|mine tailings]]) and [[Dune|sand dune]] stabilising. 

Species of broom popular in [[horticulture]] are '''purple broom''' (''[[Chamaecytisus purpureus]]''; purple flowers), '''Atlas broom''' (or '''Moroccan broom''') (''[[Argyrocytisus battandieri]]'', [[synonym (botany)|syn.]] ''Cytisus battandieri'', with silvery foliage), '''dwarf broom''' (''[[Cytisus procumbens]]''), '''Provence broom''' (''[[Cytisus purgans]]'') and '''Spanish broom''' (''[[Spanish Broom|Spartium junceum]]''). 

Many of the most popular brooms in gardens are [[hybrid]]s, notably '''Kew broom''' (''Cytisus'' <U+00D7> ''kewensis'', hybrid between ''C. ardoinii'' and ''C. multiflorus'') and '''Warminster broom''' (''Cytisus'' <U+00D7> ''praecox'', hybrid between ''C. purgans'' and ''C. multiflorus'').

===Invasive species===
In some areas of [[North America]], '''common broom''', introduced as an [[ornamental plant]], has become naturalised and an [[invasive species|invasive]] [[weed]] due to its aggressive seed dispersal; it has proved very difficult to eradicate. Similarly, it is a major problem species in the cooler and wetter areas of southern [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. On the west coast of the United States, '''French broom''' (''[[French Broom|Genista monspessulana]]'') and '''Spanish broom''' (''[[Spanish Broom|Spartium junceum]]'') are also considered noxious invasives, as they are quickly crowding out native vegetation, and grow most prolifically in the least accessible areas.

==Historical uses==
The [[Angevin|Plantagenet]] kings used '''common broom''' (known as ''"planta genista"'' in Latin) as an emblem and took their name from it. It was originally the emblem of [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]], father of [[Henry II of England]]. Wild broom is still common in dry habitats around [[Anjou]], France.

''[[Genista tinctoria]]'' ('''dyer's broom''', also known as '''dyer's greenweed''' or '''dyer's greenwood'''), provides a useful yellow [[dye]] and was grown commercially for this purpose in parts of Britain into the early 19th century. Woollen cloth, [[mordant]]ed with [[alum]], was dyed yellow with dyer's greenweed, then dipped into a vat of blue dye ([[woad]] or, later, [[indigo]]) to produce the once-famous "Kendal Green" (largely superseded by the brighter "Saxon Green" in the 1770s). '''[[Kendal]] green''' is a local common name for the plant.

The flower buds and flowers of ''Cytisus scoparius'' have been used as a salad ingredient, raw or pickled, and were a popular ingredient for [[salmagundi]] or "grand sallet" during the 17th and 18th century.

==Folklore==
A traditional rhyme from [[Sussex]] says: "Sweep the house with blossed broom in [[May]]/sweep the head of the household away." Despite this, it was also common to include a decorated bundle of broom at weddings. Ashes of broom were used to treat [[dropsy]], while its strong smell was said to be able to tame wild horses and dogs.
