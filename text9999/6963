== Officiating career ==
Before officiating in the NBA, Donaghy spent five years working [[Pennsylvania]] high school games,<ref name=NBRA /> seven seasons in the [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA), and was the head official for the 1993 CBA All-Star Game.<ref>''The Hot List'', [[ESPNews]], July 20, 2007.</ref>  The following year, he joined the NBA, where he worked for 13 years, officiating in 772 regular-season games and 20 playoff games.<ref name=closerlook /> Donaghy was a participant in the NBA's Read to Achieve program, for which he participated in an event at the Universal Charter school during the [[2002 NBA Finals]].<ref name=closerlook /> His uniform number was 21.<ref name="NBRA" />

Donaghy was one of three referees who worked the [[Pacers<U+2013>Pistons brawl]] at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] on November 19, 2004, which ended in a fight between [[Indiana Pacers|Pacers]] players and [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]] fans.<ref name="ESPN_brawl">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241119008|title=Carlisle: 'I was fighting for my life out there'|date=November 19, 2004|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref><ref name="ESPN_brawlboxscore">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=241119008|title=Indiana Pacers vs. Detroit Pistons <U+2013> Box Score <U+2013> November 19, 2004|date=February 8, 2009|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref><ref name=AP>{{cite news |title = FBI probes whether NBA ref bet on games |url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2007-07-20-referee-probe_N.htm | first=Kevin|last=Johnson|coauthor=McCarthy, Michael|work=[[USA Today]] |date=July 20, 2007 |accessdate=July 23, 2010 }}</ref> 

Donaghy was also involved in another controversial incident in 2003, when he called a [[technical foul]] on [[Rasheed Wallace]], then playing with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], for allegedly throwing a ball at another official during a game played at the [[Rose Garden Arena]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name=Aldridge>{{cite news|title=FBI investigating area NBA referee |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_top/20070720_FBI_investigating_area_NBA_referee.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929133029/http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_top/20070720_FBI_investigating_area_NBA_referee.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |last=Aldridge|first=David|authorlink=David Aldridge|coauthors=Narducci, Marc|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=July 20, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref> While Donaghy was leaving the arena, he was confronted by Wallace at the arena's loading dock, where Wallace screamed [[obscenities]] at Donaghy.<ref name=Aldridge/> Donaghy claimed that Wallace threatened him, and after an investigation by the NBA, Wallace was suspended seven games.<ref name=Aldridge/> This was the longest suspension issued by the league for an incident not involving violence or drugs.<ref name=Inside>{{cite news|title=Inside the NBA |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2003/01/28/nba/ |last=Thomsen|first=Ian|publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |date=January 29, 2003|accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref>

== Betting scandal ==
{{main|2007 NBA betting scandal}}
On July 20, 2007, columnist Murray Weiss of the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported an investigation by the FBI into allegations of an NBA referee betting on games to control the point spread.<ref name=Post>{{cite news|title=NBA in a 'Fix' |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07202007/news/columnists/nba_in_a_fix_columnists_murray_weiss.htm?page=0 |last=Weiss|first=Murray|work=New York Post |date=July 20, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref>  It was revealed that Donaghy, who has a gambling problem, placed tens of thousands of dollars in bets on games during the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06]] and [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season|2006<U+2013>07 season]] and had been approached by low-level mob associates to work on a gambling scheme.<ref name=Yahoo>{{cite news|title=Questionable calls |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-referee072007&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|date=July 20, 2007 |accessdate=July 20, 2007}}</ref> [[Mike Missanelli]] of ''[[The Stephen A.

The report sent shock waves through the NBA. While the league devotes significant resources to monitor officials' performance, it only found out about the affair when the FBI stumbled upon Donaghy in the midst of a broader organized crime investigation.<ref name=Jones>{{cite news|title=Corruption on the court is bad news for NBA |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jones/070720 |last=Jones|first=Bomani|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=July 20, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref>  NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] said in a statement, "We would like to assure our fans that no amount of effort, time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation, to bring to justice an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust in professional sports, and to take the necessary steps to protect against this ever happening again."<ref name=Yahoo /> He called the scandal a "wakeup call that says you can't be complacent".<ref name="Stern_wakeup">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2007-08-15-ref-reaction_N.htm|title=NBA ref scandal is 'wakeup call,' Stern says|last=Nance|first=Roscoe|date=August 16, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

Sports gambling expert [[R. J. Bell]], president of sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007. He discovered that during the two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time.  In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time.  According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was "a 99.9 percent chance that these results would not have happened without an outside factor".  He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip<U+2014>an indication that big money had been wagered on the game.  The big money won every time<U+2014>another indication that "something (was) going on".  However, Bell suggested that there was no way anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=expertstatsdonaghy | title = Numbers indicate unlikely outcomes in games Donaghy officiated | publisher=[[ESPN]] | author = Drehs, Wayne | date = July 24, 2007 | accessdate = July 25, 2007 | authorlink = Wayne Drehs }}</ref>

Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a "rogue official".  According to Lang, an official can directly influence the outcome of a game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game.  Lang also believed that a [[bookie]] connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=expertexplainsNBAbets | title = Expert explains the many ways a crooked referee could fix bets | publisher=[[ESPN]] | author = Drehs, Wayne | date = July 23, 2007 | accessdate = July 25, 2007 | authorlink = Wayne Drehs }}</ref>

In a letter to Stern, Rush indicated that he might call a hearing "should the facts warrant public scrutiny."  He also said that the affair could potentially be "one of the most damaging scandals in the history of American sports".<ref>{{cite news | title = Congressman requests meeting with Stern to discuss gambling scandal | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2950266 | work= ESPN News | date = July 27, 2007 | accessdate = July 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Earlier in the day, federal sources told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' that Donaghy would surrender to the FBI and pleaded guilty to gambling charges.  The ''Daily News'' also learned that the bookies in the scandal were two high school classmates of Donaghy's who embellished their mob ties.  The ''Daily News'' reported that at his friends' request, Donaghy passed word about the crews working the games they planned to bet on.<ref name="Bookies">{{cite news |title=Rogue ref's bookies old HS chums |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/2007/07/26/2007-07-26_rogue_refs_bookies_old_hs_chums-3.html |last=Jaccarino|first=Mike|coauthors=John Marzulli and Bill Hutchinson|work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=July 27, 2007|accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>  The [[Associated Press]] identified one of the men as James Battista, former owner of a sports bar in [[Havertown, Pennsylvania]]; a Philadelphia suburb.

At his home in Bradenton, Donaghy did not initially comment on his situation.  He reportedly claimed to be "the butler" to visiting reporters and turned his sprinklers on a freelance photographer for the ''[[New York Times]]'' when he got too close.<ref name="Bookies"/>  His wife (at the time), Kimberly, passed a note to reporters telling them not to bother asking them any questions.<ref>{{cite news | title =  Ref still hiding & wife blows whistle on media | work=New York Daily News | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/2007/08/10/2007-08-10_ref_still_hiding__wife_blows_whistle_on_.html | date = August 10, 2007 | accessdate = October 10, 2007 | first = Dorian | last = Block}}</ref>

On August 15, Donaghy appeared in a [[Brooklyn]] federal court and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in [[wire fraud]] and transmitting wagering information through interstate commerce.  Donaghy told U.S. District Judge [[Carol Bagley Amon]] that he used coded language to tip Battista about players' physical condition and player/referee relations.  In doing so, Donaghy disclosed classified information that he obtained as an NBA referee.  Donaghy initially received $2,000 per correct pick, but his calls were so accurate that Battista increased his take to $5,000.  In total, he received $30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies.<ref name="Sorry">{{cite news|title=Donaghy huddles with family after admitting he got $30G in bet plot that rocked NBA|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/2007/08/17/2007-08-17_im_doggone_sorry_says_ref-2.html|last=Yaniv|first=Oren|work=New York Daily News|date=August 17, 2007|accessdate=August 18, 2007}}</ref>  Another high school friend of Donaghy's, Thomas Martino, acted as the middle man.

Donaghy specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006<U+2013>07 season.  Prosecutors also said that Donaghy bet on games himself.

According to the Associated Press, Andrew Thomas, the former county attorney for [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], asked the NBA and FBI if Donaghy intentionally miscalled two [[Phoenix Suns]] road playoff games.  The games in question occurred on April 29, 2007 versus the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and May 12, 2007 versus the [[San Antonio Spurs]].  In a letter to Stern and FBI director [[Robert Mueller]], Thomas said that Donaghy's conduct may have violated Arizona criminal law, and could face charges there.<ref>{{cite web | title =Raging Arizona: Donaghy could face state charges | publisher =Associated Press | date =August 16, 2007 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2977395  | accessdate = August 16, 2007 }}</ref>  Per the United States Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Charles Ponzi#Prison and later life|Ponzi v.

=== Allegations against the NBA ===

On June 10, 2008, Donaghy's attorney filed a court document alleging, among other things, that Game 6 of the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002 Western Conference Finals]] between the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Sacramento Kings]] was fixed by two referees. The letter states that Donaghy "learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and F to be 'company men', always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that night, it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series."<ref name="ESPNpdf">{{cite web|title=Re: United States v.

=== Sentencing ===

On July 29, 2008, Donaghy was sentenced in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|Brooklyn Federal Court]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2008-07-29-donaghy-sentence_N.htm|title=Donaghy sentenced to 15 months in gambling probe|last=Shuster|first=Rachel|date=July 30, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=August 30, 2009}}</ref> to 15 months in prison for his participation in the gambling scandal. Donaghy could have faced up to 33 months, but Judge Carol Amon reduced his sentence to 15 months (two 15-month terms served concurrently, followed by 3 years of supervised release) in exchange for his cooperation. His lawyer, John Lauro, asked for probation, but the request was denied.

=== Effect on the NBA ===
As a result of the betting scandal, Stern revised the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit not with [[sportsbook]]s. In addition, all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling. Stern stated that "[the] ban on gambling is absolute, and in my view it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting<U+2014>though not on sports. There were several other referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more in-season training and counseling  on gambling; more thorough background checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal.<ref name="ESPN_refrulechanges">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3079309|title=NBA to revamp ref gambling rules; Jackson, Nunn see roles reduced|last=Sheridan|first=Chris|date=October 26, 2007|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

In the federal prison camp in [[Pensacola, Florida]], Donaghy started to write his memoir, ''Blowing the Whistle: The Culture of Fraud in the NBA''.  The book was to have covered his NBA career, described his dealings with the "underworld" during the betting scandal and explained how he would determine the winning team in the games he refereed.  Donaghy also promised to "discuss the relationship that players, coaches and referees have with each other".<ref name="ESPN_halfwayhouse">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4267658|title=Donaghy to serve at halfway house|date=June 17, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>  The book was due to be published in October 2009.  However, Donaghy's publisher, [[Triumph Books]], canceled it because of liability concerns.  Pat Berdan, Donaghy's liaison with Triumph, said the book was canceled after the NBA threatened legal action<U+2014>which the NBA denies.<ref name="Book_cancellation">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4603209|title=Donaghy book canceled over liability|last=Alipour|first=Sam|date=October 28, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=October 28, 2009}}</ref> Donaghy found a new publisher, VTi-Group, willing to release the book, which was renamed ''[[Personal Foul (book)|Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA]]''. The book was released in December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://deadspin.com/5415679/tim-donaghy-has-found-a-publisher|title=Tim Donaghy Has Found A Publisher |last=Craggs|first=Tommy|date=November 30, 2009|publisher=[[Deadspin]]|accessdate=December 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/sports/basketball/03donaghy.html|title=Disgraced Referee<U+2019>s Book Describes Gambling on N.B.A. Games |last=Belson|first=Ken|date=December 3, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 3, 2009}}</ref>

During his imprisonment, Donaghy was attacked and threatened. In November 2007, a man claiming to be an associate of the [[American Mafia|New York Mafia]] struck Donaghy with a paint roller extension bar, resulting in injuries to his knee and leg which required surgery.<ref name="ESPN_halfwayhouse" /><ref name="transfer">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/2009/06/11/2009-06-11_former_nba_referee_tin_donaghy_to_be_released_from_prison_claims_he_was_beaten_b.html|title=Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy to be released from prison; claims he was beaten by mobbed up inmate|last=Goldsmith|first=Samuel|date=June 11, 2009|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

Donaghy was released from prison after serving 11 months and was due to finish his sentence in a [[recovery house]] near [[Tampa, Florida]], where he will be treated for his gambling addiction as mandated by the court.<ref name="ESPN_halfwayhouse" /><ref name="transfer" /> He was arrested and put in the county jail in late August after being caught at a health club without permission when he should have been at work. His lawyer and ex-wife insisted that Donaghy should not have been taken into custody, as he was allowed to visit the center to rehabilitate his injured knee.<ref name="jailed_again">{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/sports/20090826_Disgraced_NBA_referee_Donaghy_back_in_jail_for_rule_violation.html|title=Disgraced NBA referee Donaghy back in jail for rule violation|last=Bender|first=William|date=August 26, 2009|work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|accessdate=August 30, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="jailed_again_wifecomplaint">{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/sports/20090827_Wife_says_Donaghy__treated_unfairly__in_Florida.html|title=Wife says Donaghy 'treated unfairly' in Florida|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Frank|date=August 27, 2009|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=August 30, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On November 4, 2009, Donaghy was released from prison in Hernando County after serving out the remainder of his sentence.<ref name="ESPN_release">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4622537&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines|title=Disgraced former NBA ref leaves jail|date=November 4, 2009|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}</ref>

Donaghy sued VTi-Group, the publisher of his memoir, for not paying him. In June 2012, a jury found VTi liable for [[breach of contract]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8068721/ex-nba-referee-tim-donaghy-wins-13m-lawsuit|title=Ex-ref Tim Donaghy wins lawsuit|date=June 18, 2012|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>
