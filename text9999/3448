The '''Inner Hebrides''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Na h-Eileanan a-staigh'') is an [[archipelago]] off the west coast of [[Scotland]], to the south east of the [[Outer Hebrides]].  Together these two island chains form the [[Hebrides]], which enjoy a mild oceanic climate. There are 36 inhabited islands and a further 43 uninhabited Inner Hebrides with an area greater than {{convert|30|ha|acres}}. The main commercial activities are tourism, [[croft (land)|crofting]], fishing, and [[Scotch whisky|whisky distilling]]. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Combined, the islands have an area of approximately {{convert|415800|ha|sqmi|0}}, and had a population of 18,257 people in 2001.<ref name=GRO>General Register Office for Scotland (28 November 2003) ''[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/census/censushm/occpapers/occasional-paper-10.html Occasional Paper No 10: Statistics for Inhabited Islands]''. (pdf) Retrieved 22 Jan 2011.</ref> The population density is therefore a little over 4 persons per km<sup>2</sup> (11 persons per square mile).

There are various important prehistoric structures, many of which pre-date the first written references to the islands by [[Classical antiquity|Roman and Greek]] authors. In the historic period the earliest known settlers were [[Picts]] to the north and [[Gaels]] in the southern kingdom of [[Dalriada]] prior to the islands becoming part of the ''[[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles|Su<U+00F0>reyjar]]'' kingdom of the [[Norsemen|Norse]], who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by various [[Scottish clan|clan]] chiefs, principal of whom were the [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeods]] and [[Clan Donald|MacDonalds]]. The [[Highland Clearances]] of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline.

Sea transport is crucial and a variety of ferry services operate between the islands and to mainland [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] language remains strong in some areas, the landscapes have inspired a variety of artists, and there is a diversity of wildlife.

==Geography==
The islands form a disparate archipelago of which the largest are, from south to north [[Islay]], [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], [[R<U+00F9>m]], and [[Skye]]. Skye is the largest of all and most populous with an area of {{convert|165,625|ha|sqmi|0}} and a population of circa 9,200.<ref name=HSTabs>Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 502-5</ref><ref name=HS173>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 173</ref>

The southern group are in [[Argyll]], an area roughly corresponding with the heartlands of the ancient kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] and incorporated into the modern [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council area]] of [[Argyll and Bute]]. The northern islands were part of the [[Counties of Scotland|county]] of Inverness-shire and are now in the [[Highland (local government area)|Highland Council]] area.

The geology and geomorphology of the islands is varied. Some, such as Skye and Mull, are mountainous, whilst others like [[Tiree]] are relatively low lying. The highest eminences are found in the [[Cuillin]] hills of Skye, although peaks over {{convert|300|m|ft}} are common elsewhere.<ref name=HSTabs/> Much of the coastline is [[Machair (geography)|machair]], a fertile low-lying dune pastureland.<ref>McKirdy ''et al'' (2007) p. 224</ref> Many of the islands are swept by strong tides, and the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan|Corryvreckan tide race]] between [[Scarba]] and Jura is one of the largest whirlpools in the world.<ref>The Corryvreckan is regularly cited as the third largest whirlpool of the world - see for example [http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst10418.html "Corryvreckan Whirlpool "] Gazetteer for Scotland. Retrieved 19 September 2009. Some sources suggest it is the second largest after the [[Moskstraumen]].</ref>

There are various small subsidiary archipelagoes including the [[Ascrib Islands]], [[Crowlin Islands]], [[Slate Islands]], [[Small Isles]], [[Summer Isles]] and [[Treshnish Islands]].

The 36 inhabited islands of the Inner Hebrides had a population of 18,257 at the time of the 2001 census.<ref name=GRO>General Register Office for Scotland (2003).</ref> There are a further 43 uninhabited Inner Hebrides with an area greater than 30 hectares (approximately 74 acres). Records for the last date of settlement for the smaller islands are incomplete, but most of them would have been inhabited at some point during the [[Neolithic]], [[Iron Age]], [[Early Middle Ages|Early Historic]] or [[Viking|Norse]] periods.  In common with the other main island chains of Scotland many of the smaller and more remote islands were abandoned during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since the prehistoric period. This process  involved a transition from these places being perceived as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies<ref>See for example Hunter (2000) pp. 152<U+2013>158</ref> to a view becoming held by both island residents and outsiders alike that the more remote islands lacked the essential services of a modern industrial economy.<ref>See for example Maclean (1977) Chapter 10: "Arcady Despoiled" pp. 125<U+2013>35</ref> However, the larger islands have retained their populations well, which grew overall by more than 12% from 1981-2001.<ref name=GRO/>

The main commercial activities are tourism, [[croft (land)|crofting]], fishing, and [[Scotch whisky|whisky distilling]] (centred on [[Islay whisky|Islay]]). Overall, the area is relatively reliant on primary industries and the public sector; there is a dependence on self employment and micro-business, and most parts are defined by [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]] as economically "Fragile Areas". However,  the islands are well placed to exploit renewable energy, particularly onshore and offshore wind and the [[Sleat]] peninsula of Skye is an example of a more economically robust area.<ref>[http://www.hie.co.uk/highlands-and-islands/area-information/argyll-and-the-islands/economic-profile.html "Argyll and the Islands - economic profile"].

===Climate===
The influence of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Gulf Stream]] create a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6.5 [[<U+00B0>C]] (44 [[<U+00B0>F]]) in January and 15.4 <U+00B0>C (60 <U+00B0>F) in July at Duntulm on the [[Trotternish]] peninsula of Skye.<ref name=Cooper/><ref>See also [http://www.carbostweather.co.uk/Staffin/staffinweather.htm "Weather Data for Staffin Isle of Skye"]. carbostweather.co.uk.

==Prehistory==
[[Image:Dun Ringill.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of [[Dun Ringill]], near [[Elgol]] on the island of [[Skye]]]]
The Hebrides were originally settled in the [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic era]] and have a diversity of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] sites. A flint arrowhead found in a field near Bridgend, Islay has been dated to  10,800 BC. This find may indicate the presence of a summer hunting party rather than permanent settlement.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 42</ref> Burnt [[Corylus avellana|hazelnut]] shells and microscopic [[charcoal]] found at Farm Fields, Kinloch on R<U+00F9>m indicate a settlement of some kind and this is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.<ref>Edwards, Kevin J. and Whittington, Graeme "Vegetation Change" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) p. 70</ref><ref>Occupation at this site is dated to 8590+/-95 uncorrected radiocarbon years [[Before Present|BP]]. Edwards, Kevin J., and Mithen, Steven (Feb., 1995) [http://www.jstor.org/pss/124921 "The Colonization of the Hebridean Islands of Western Scotland: Evidence from the Palynological and Archaeological Records,"] ''World Archaeology''. '''26'''. No. 3 p. 348. Retrieved 20 April 2008.</ref><ref>Finlayson, Bill and Edwards, Kevin J. "The Mesolithic" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) p. 115</ref>

Evidence of large-scale [[Mesolithic]] nut processing, [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to circa 7000 BC, has been found in a [[midden]] pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains of hundreds of thousands of burned hazelnut shells<ref name="Nuts1">[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba5/ba5news.html "Mesolithic food industry on Colonsay"] (June 1995) ''British Archaeology''. No. 5. Retrieved 25 May 2008.</ref><ref name=Moff>Moffat (2005) pp. 91&ndash;2</ref> and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and [[pollen analysis]] suggests that the [[hazel]] trees were all cut down at the same time.<ref name=Moff/> The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.<ref name="Nuts1"/>

Three stone [[hearth]]s and traces of red [[ochre]] found on Jura and dated to 6000 BC are the earliest stone-built structures found so far in Scotland.<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 90&ndash;91.</ref><ref>Mercer, John (1972) "Microlithic and Bronze Age camps, 75&ndash;26 ft OD, N Carn, Jura".

==Etymology==
[[File:Blaeu.1654.submap.Ptolemy.Damnij.jpg|thumb|"Old Britain" as shown on [[Willem Blaeu|Blaeu's]] 1654 atlas of Scotland, based on [[Ptolemy]].]]
The earliest written references that have survived relating to these islands were made by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Natural History'', where he states that there are 30 "Hebudes". Writing about 80 years later in the period 140-150 AD, [[Ptolemy]], drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] refers to the "Ebudes", of which he writes there were only five, thus possibly specifically meaning the Inner Hebrides.<ref name=Breeze>Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Ballin Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13</ref><ref name=Watson>Watson (1926) pp. 40-41</ref> Pliny probably took his information from [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille#Prehistory and classical antiquity|Massilia]] who visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC. It is possible that Ptolemy did as well, as Agricola's information about the west coast of Scotland was of poor quality.<ref name=Breeze/><ref name=Watson/>

Watson (1926) states that the meaning of Ptolemy's "Eboudai" is unknown and that the root may be pre-Celtic.<ref>Watson (1926) p. 38</ref>{{#tag:ref| Murray (1966) claims that Ptolemy's "Ebudae" was originally derived from the [[Old Norse]] ''Havbredey'', meaning "isles on the edge of the sea".<ref>Murray (1966) p. 1</ref>  The idea is often repeated but no firm evidence of this derivation has emerged.|group="Note"}} Other early written references include the flight of the [[Nemed]] people from Ireland to "Domon and to Erdomon in the north of Alba", which is mentioned in the 12th century ''[[Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn]]''.<ref name=Watson/> Domon, meaning the "deep sea isle" refers to the Outer Hebrides and Erdomon, meaning "east of, on or near Domon" is thus the Inner Hebrides.<ref name=Watson/>

The individual island and place names in the Outer Hebrides have mixed Gaelic and Norse origins.<ref name =MacanT>Mac an T<U+00E0>illeir (2003) various pages.</ref>

==History==
===D<U+00E1>l Riata===
{{main| D<U+00E1>l Riata}}
Although Ptolemy's map identifies various tribes such as the ''[[Creones]]'' that might conceivably have lived in the Inner Hebrides in the Roman era,<ref name=Breeze/>
the first written records of life begin in the 6th century AD when the founding of the kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] is recorded.<ref>Nieke, Margaret R. "Secular Society from the Iron Age to D<U+00E1>l Riata and the Kingdom of Scots" in Omand (2006) p. 60</ref> This encompassed roughly what is now [[Argyll and Bute]] and [[Lochaber]] in Scotland and [[County Antrim]] in Ireland.<ref name="OxfordCompanion1">Lynch (2007)  pp. 161 162</ref> 
[[Image:St-martins-cross.jpg|left|thumb|The 8th century St Martin's Cross on [[Iona]]]] 
In [[Argyll]] it consisted initially of three main [[clan|kindreds]]: [[Loarn mac Eirc|Cen<U+00E9>l Loairn]] in north and mid-Argyll, [[Cen<U+00E9>l n<U+00D3>engusa]] based on Islay and [[Cen<U+00E9>l nGabr<U+00E1>in]] based in [[Kintyre]]. By the end of the 7th century a fourth kindred, [[Cen<U+00E9>l Comgaill]] had emerged, based in eastern Argyll.<ref name="OxfordCompanion1"/> 

The figure of [[Columba]] looms large in any history of  D<U+00E1>l Riata and his founding of a monastery on [[Iona]] ensured that D<U+00E1>l Riata would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain. However, Iona was far from unique. [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore]] in the territory of the Cen<U+00E9>l Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg, [[Hinba]] and Tiree, are known from the annals.<ref>Clancy, Thomas Owen "Church institutions: early medieval" in Lynch (2001).</ref> The kingdom's independent existence ended in the [[Viking Age]], and it eventually merged with the lands of the [[Picts]] to form the [[Kingdom of Alba]]. 

North of D<U+00E1>l Riata the Inner Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control although the historical record is sparse.{{#tag:ref|Hunter (2000) states that in relation to King [[Bridei I of the Picts]] in the sixth century: "As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.<U+201D><ref>Hunter (2000) pp. 44, 49</ref>|group="Note"}}

According to <U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1998) "when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable"<ref><U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (1998) p. 25</ref> although from 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded. "All the islands of Britain" were devastated in 794<ref>Thomson (2008) p. 24-27</ref> with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806.<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 57</ref> In 870 [[Dumbarton Castle|Dumbarton]] was besieged by [[Amla<U+00ED>b Conung]] and <U+00CD>mar, "the two kings of the Northmen".<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 109</ref> It is therefore likely that Scandinavian hegemony was already significant on the western coasts of Scotland by then.<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 115</ref> In the 9th century the first references to the ''[[Norse-Gaels|Gallg<U+00E1>edil]]'' (i.e "foreign Gaels") appear. This term was variously used in succeeding centuries to refer to individuals of mixed Scandinavian-Celtic descent and/or culture who became dominant in south-west Scotland, parts of northern England and the isles.<ref>Woolf (2007) pp. 253, 296-97</ref>

The early tenth century are an obscure period so far as the Hebrides are concerned<ref name=G4-6/> but [[Amla<U+00ED>b Cuar<U+00E1>n|Aulaf mac Sitric]], who fought at the [[Battle of Brunanburh]] in 937 is recorded as a King of the Isles from c. 941-980.<ref name=G4-6>Gregory (1881) pp. 4-6</ref> 

It is difficult to reconcile the records of the Irish annals with Norse sources such as the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'' but it is likely that Norwegian and ''Gallg<U+00E1>edil'' [[U<U+00ED> <U+00CD>mair]] warlords fought for control for much of period from the 9th to the 12th centuries.  In 990 [[Sigurd the Stout]], Earl of Orkney took command of the Hebrides,<ref>Hunter (2000) p. 84</ref> a position he retained for most of the period until he was killed at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014.<ref name=G4-6/><ref>Woolf (2007) p. 213</ref> There is then a period of uncertainty but it is possible that Sigurd's son [[Thorfinn the Mighty]] became ruler circa 1035 until his own death some two decades later.<ref name=G5>Gregory (1881) p. 5</ref>

By the late 12th century Irish influence became a significant feature of island life and [[Diarmait mac Ma<U+00ED>l na mB<U+00F3>]], the [[High King of Ireland]] took possession of Mann and the Isles until 1072.<ref name=G5/><ref name=D101>Duffy (1992) pp. 100-01</ref> The records for the rulers of the Hebrides are obscured again until the arrival of [[Godred Crovan]] as King of Dublin and and the Isles.<ref name=D108/> The ancestor of many of the succeeding rulers of Mann and the Isles, he was eventually ousted by [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]] and fled to Islay, where he died in the plague of 1095.<ref name=D106>Duffy (1992) p. 106</ref><ref name=D108>Duffy (1992) p. 108</ref><ref name=W2p212>Woolf (2005) p. 212</ref> It is not clear the extent to which [[O'Brien dynasty|Ui Briain]] dominance was now asserted in the islands north of Man, but growing Irish influence in these seas brought a rapid and decisive response from Norway.

This strategy eventually led to an invasion by [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonarson]], King of Norway. After the stalemate of the [[Battle of Largs]], Haakon retreated to Orkney, where he died in 1263. Following this expedition, the Hebrides and Mann and all rights that the Norwegian crown "had of old therein" were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 [[Treaty of Perth]].<ref>Hunter (2000) pp. 106-111</ref><ref>Barrett (2008) p. 411</ref><ref>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol04/v3p210.htm "Agreement between Magnus IV and Alexander III, 1266"] isleofman.com.

===Clans and Scottish rule===
The Lords of the Isles, a phrase first recorded in 1336,<ref>Oram, Richard "The Lordship of the Isles: 1336-1545" in Omand (2006) p. 123</ref>  would continue to rule the Inner Hebrides as well as part of the Western Highlands as subjects of the King of Scots until [[John of Islay, Earl of Ross|John MacDonald]], fourth Lord of the Isles, squandered the family's powerful position. Through a secret treaty with [[Edward IV of England]], negotiated at [[Ardtornish Castle]] and signed in 1462, he made himself a servant of the English crown.  When [[James III of Scotland]] found out about the treaty in 1476, he issued a sentence of forfeiture for MacDonald's lands. Some were restored for a promise of good behaviour, but MacDonald was unable to control his son [[Aonghas <U+00D3>g]], who defeated him at the [[Battle of Bloody Bay]] fought of the coast of Mull near [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]] in 1481. A further rebellion by his nephew, [[Alexander of Lochalsh]] provoked an exasperated James IV to forfeit the lands for the last time in 1493.<ref>Oram, Richard "The Lordship of the Isles: 1336-1545" in Omand (2006) pp. 135-38</ref>

The most powerful clans on Skye in the post&ndash;Norse period were [[Clan MacLeod]], originally based in [[Trotternish]], and Clan MacDonald of [[Sleat]]. Following the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles, the Mackinnons also emerged as an independent clan, whose substantial landholdings in Skye were centred on [[Strathaird]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mackinnon.org/mackinnon-short-history.html#Beginnings|title=The Clan Mackinnon: a short history|last=Mackinnon|first=C.

After the failure of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion of 1745, [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]] became famous for rescuing Prince [[Charles Edward Stuart]] from the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] troops. Her story is strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at [[Kilmuir, Skye|Kilmuir]].<ref>[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_photograph.jsp?item_id=12379 "Flora Macdonald's Grave, Kilmuir"] Am Baile.

===British era===
[[Image:Clachan Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Telford|Telford's]] [[Clachan Bridge]] between the mainland and [[Seil]],  also known as the "Bridge across the Atlantic", was built in 1792.<ref>Murray (1977) p. 121</ref>]]
With the implementation of the [[Treaty of Union]] in 1707 the Hebrides became part of the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], but the clans' loyalties to a distant monarch were not strong. A considerable number of islesmen "came out" in support of the Jacobite [[Earl of Mar]] in the [[Jacobite Risings|"15"]] and again in the 1745 rising including Macleod of [[Dunvegan]] and [[Clan MacLea|MacLea]] of Lismore.<ref>[http://www.castlescotland.net/the-castles/d/dunvegan.html "Dunvegan"] castlescotland.net Retrieved 17 Jan 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.clanmclea.co.uk/Donald_Livingstone.htm "Incidents of the Jacobite Risings - Donald Livingstone"] clanmclea.co.uk.

Retrieved 16 Jan 2011.</ref>  The UK government's strategy was to estrange the clan chiefs from their kinsmen and turn their descendants into English-speaking landlords whose main concern was the revenues their estates brought rather than the welfare of those who lived on them.

The early 19th century was a time of improvement and population growth. Roads and quays were built, the [[slate]] industry became a significant employer on Easdale and surrounding islands, and the construction of the [[Crinan Canal|Crinan]] and [[Caledonian Canal|Caledonian]] canals and other engineering works such as [[Thomas Telford|Telford's]] "[[Clachan Bridge|Bridge across the Atlantic]]" improved transport and access.<ref>Duncan, P. J.

J. "The Industries of Argyll: Tradition and Improvement" in Omand (2006) pp. 157-58</ref> and large scale emigration became endemic.  The "[[Camastianavaig|Battle of the Braes]]" involved a demonstration against lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices. This event was instrumental in the creation of the [[Napier Commission]], which reported in 1884 on the situation in the Highlands. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 [[Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886|Crofters' Act]] and on one occasion 400 [[Marine (military)|marines]] were deployed on Skye to maintain order.<ref>[http://www.highlandclearances.info/clearances/clearances_battleofthebrae.htm "Battle of the Braes"] highlandclearances.info.
