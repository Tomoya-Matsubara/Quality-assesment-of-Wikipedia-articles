'''Elizabeth I''' ([[7 September]] [[1533]] <U+2013> [[24 March]] [[1603]]) was [[List of British monarchs|Queen of England]] and [[Queen of Ireland|Ireland]] from [[17 November]] [[1558]] until her death. Sometimes referred to as '''The Virgin Queen''', '''Gloriana''', or '''Good Queen Bess''', Elizabeth was the fifth and last monarch of the [[House of Tudor| Tudor dynasty]], succeeding her half-sister, [[Mary I of England| Mary]].

Elizabeth's reign is referred to as the [[Elizabethan era]]. Playwrights [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], and [[Ben Jonson]] all thrived during this time; [[Francis Bacon]] wrote philosophical and political works; [[Francis Drake]] became the first Englishman to [[circumnavigate]] the globe; and the first English colonies in [[North America]] were founded under Sir James Huckle, [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Humphrey Gilbert|Sir Humphrey Gilbert]]. Like her father, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], Elizabeth was a writer and poet. She granted [[Royal Charter]]s to several famous organisations, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]] ([[1592]]) and the [[British East India Company]] ([[1600]]).

Elizabeth was a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler. Her motto was ''video et taceo'': "I see but say nothing".<ref>Neale, 386.</ref> This strategy, viewed with impatience by her counsellors, often saved her from political and marital misalliances. She was reluctant to grant [[honours]] and [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom| dignities]] and created only nine new [[peerage|peers]] during her reign. She reduced the number of [[Privy Council|Privy Counsellors]] from thirty-nine to nineteen, and later to fourteen. After the short reigns of her brother and sister, her forty-five years on the throne provided stability for the kingdom. Though she reigned during a period of deep religious division in the country, her reforms of the [[Church of England]] established a compromise between Catholic and Protestant positions.

==Early life==
[[Image:El bieta I lat 13.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Elizabeth Tudor, c. 1546, by an unknown artist. The simplicity of this portrait contrasts with the ornate icons that were to come later.<ref>"The painter...is unknown, but in a competently Flemish style he depicts the daughter of Anne Boleyn as quiet and studious-looking, ornament in her attire as secondary to the plainness of line that emphasizes her youth. Great is the contrast with the awesome fantasy of the later portraits: the pallid, mask-like features, the extravagance of headdress and ruff, the padded ornateness that seemed to exclude all humanity." Gaunt, 37.</ref>]]

Elizabeth I was born in the [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]] on [[7 September]] [[1533]] and named after her paternal grandmother [[Elizabeth of York]].<ref>Somerset, 4.</ref> She was the second child of [[Henry VIII of England]] to survive infancy; her mother was Henry's second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]]. Upon her birth Elizabeth was the [[heiress presumptive]] to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], had lost her position as legitimate heir when Henry had annulled his marriage to her mother, [[Catherine of Aragon]].<ref>Loades, 3<U+2013>5.<br /><U+2022> Somerset, 4<U+2013>5.</ref>

Henry had desperately wanted a legitimate son, to ensure the Tudor succession. After Elizabeth's birth Queen Anne was unable to provide such an heir and suffered at least two miscarriages, one in 1534 and another at the beginning of 1536. The latter was swiftly followed by her downfall. She was arrested on [[2 May]], [[1536]], imprisoned, and [[beheaded]] on [[19 May]] [[1536]] after being falsely convicted of [[treason]], [[incest]] with her younger brother, [[George Boleyn]], and [[witchcraft]]. Anne's execution was apparently orchestrated by her political rivals.<ref>Loades, 6<U+2013>7.<br /><U+2022> Haigh, 1<U+2013>3.</ref>

Elizabeth, who was nearly three years old when her mother was executed, was declared illegitimate and lost the title of princess.<ref>In the act of July 1536, it was stated that Elizabeth was "illegitimate... and utterly foreclosed, excluded and banned to claim, challenge, or demand any inheritance as lawful heir...to [the King] by lineal descent". Somerset, 10.</ref> Eleven days after Anne Boleyn's death, Henry married [[Jane Seymour]],<ref>"It had taken Henry VIII a month to dispose of his wife on a charge of treason, sweep some of her friends to the block with her, bastardise her child, and acquire a new queen. Here was the power of the Tudor monarchy in action, with the King bending his Council, the Church, and the law to do his will." Haigh, 1.</ref> who died 12 days after the birth of their son, [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]]. Elizabeth was placed in Edward's household and carried the [[chrisom]], or baptismal cloth, at his christening.<ref>Loades, 7<U+2013>8.</ref>

The embroidered binding with the monogram KP for "Katherin Parr" is believed to have been worked by Elizabeth.<ref>Cyril Davenport, ''English Embroidered Bookbindings'', Alfred Pollard (ed.), London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr<U+00FC>bner and Co., 1899, 32.

Elizabeth's first governess was [[Margaret Bryan|Lady Margaret Bryan]], who wrote that she was <U+201C>as toward a child and as gentle of conditions as ever I knew any in my life<U+201D>.<ref>Somerset, 11.</ref> At the age of four, Elizabeth passed into the care of [[Catherine Champernowne]], better known by her later, married name of Catherine <U+201C>Kat<U+201D> Ashley, who remained Elizabeth<U+2019>s friend for life. The evidence shows that Champernowne made a good job of Elizabeth<U+2019>s early education: by the time William Grindal became her tutor in 1544, Elizabeth could write English, Latin, and Italian. Under Grindal, a talented and skilful tutor, she also progressed in French and Greek.<ref>Our knowledge of Elizabeth<U+2019>s schooling and precocity comes largely from the memoirs of [[Roger Ascham]], the tutor of Prince Edward. Loades, 8<U+2013>10.</ref> After Grindal died in 1548, Elizabeth received her education under [[Roger Ascham]], a sympathetic teacher who believed that learning should be fun.<ref>Somerset, 25.</ref> By the time her formal education ended in 1550, she was the best educated woman of her generation.<ref>Loades, 21.</ref>

==Thomas Seymour==
Henry VIII died in 1547, when Elizabeth was 13 years of age, and was succeeded by [[Edward VI of England| Edward VI]]. [[Catherine Parr]], Henry's last wife, soon married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley]], Edward VI's uncle and the brother of the Lord Protector, [[Edward Seymour]]. The couple took Elizabeth into their household at Chelsea. There Elizabeth experienced an emotional crisis that historians believe affected her for the rest of her life.<ref name ="Ls">Loades, 11.</ref> Seymour, approaching forty but with a natural charm and "a powerful sex appeal",<ref name ="Ls">Loades, 11.</ref> engaged in romps and horseplay with the fifteen-year-old Elizabeth, such as tickling her and slapping her on the buttocks, and would enter her bedroom in his nightgown. This state of affairs was put to an end after Catherine Parr, according to the testimony of a servant, discovered the pair in an embrace.<ref>Loades, 14.<br /><U+2022> "Kat Ashley told another of Elizabeth<U+2019>s servants, Thomas Parry, that the Queen lost patience with both her husband and Elizabeth after she <U+2018>suddenly came upon them where they were all alone, he having her in his arms<U+2019>.<U+201D> Somerset, 23.</ref> In May 1548, Elizabeth was sent away.<ref>She moved into the household of Catherine Ashley<U+2019>s sister Joan and her husband, [[Anthony Denny| Sir Anthony Denny]], at Cheshunt. Loades, 16.</ref>

However, that was not the last of the matter. Seymour was ambitious and was scheming to control the royal family and thereby the kingdom.<ref>Haigh, 8.<br /><U+2022> Not only Elizabeth but Princess Mary and [[Lady Jane Grey]] had lived in Seymour's household at various times. Seymour had also "wormed his way" into King Edward<U+2019>s confidence by slipping him pocket money and calling the Lord Protector stingy; and he had tried to have himself appointed the governor of the King<U+2019>s person. Neale, 32.</ref> When Catherine Parr died of [[puerperal]] fever after childbirth on [[5 September]] [[1548]], he renewed his attentions towards Elizabeth, this time with marriage in mind. For his brother and the Council, this was the last straw.<ref>Neale, 33.</ref> In January 1549, Seymour was arrested on suspicion of planning to marry Elizabeth and overthrow his brother. The details of his behaviour towards Elizabeth emerged during the subsequent interrogation of Catherine Ashley and [[Thomas Parry (Comptroller of the Household)| Thomas Parry]], Elizabeth<U+2019>s [[cofferer]].<ref>Loades, 14, 16.</ref> Elizabeth, now living at [[Hatfield House]], however, would admit nothing, much to the exasperation of her interrogator, Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, who reported, <U+201C>I do see it in her face that she is guilty<U+201D>.<ref>Neale, 33.</ref> Seymour was beheaded on March 20. No proceedings were taken against Elizabeth.

==Queen Mary==
[[Image:Queen Mary I.jpg|thumbnail|right|thumb|[[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], by [[Antonis Mor]], 1554. Mary imprisoned Elizabeth in the [[Tower of London]] for suspected collaboration with the rebel [[Thomas Wyatt the younger|Thomas Wyatt]].]]

Edward VI died of [[tuberculosis]] on [[6 July]] [[1553]], aged fifteen. His will disregarded the 1543 [[Succession to the Crown Act 1543|Act of Succession]], excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir [[Lady Jane Grey]], granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary, Duchess of Suffolk]].<ref>Loades, 24<U+2013>25.</ref> Lady Jane was proclaimed queen, but her support quickly crumbled away, and she was [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] less than two weeks later. Mary rode triumphantly into London, armed with popular support, Elizabeth at her side.<ref>Elizabeth had assembled 2,000 horsemen, "a remarkable tribute to the size of her affinity". Loades 25.</ref>

The show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. Mary was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Mass. This included Elizabeth, who had no choice but to outwardly conform.<ref>Loades, 26.</ref> Mary's initial popularity vanished as soon as it became known that she intended to marry [[Philip II of Spain|Prince Philip of Spain]], the son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor| Emperor Charles V]].<ref>Loades, 27.</ref> Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies. In January and February 1554, [[Wyatt's rebellion| rebellion]] broke out in several parts of England and Wales, led by [[Thomas Wyatt the younger| Thomas Wyatt]].<ref>Neale, 45.</ref>

Once the rising had collapsed, Elizabeth was brought to court and interrogated. On 18 March, she was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London|Tower]], where Lady Jane Grey had been executed on 12 February to deter rebels.<ref>Somerset, 49.</ref> Protesting her innocence, the twenty-year-old Elizabeth was understandably terrified.<ref>Loades, 28.</ref> Though it is unlikely that she had encouraged the rebels, it was known that some of them had approached her. Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador [[Simon Renard]], argued that her throne would never be safe as long as Elizabeth lived; the Chancellor, [[Stephen Gardiner]], worked to have Elizabeth put on trial.<ref>Somerset, 51.</ref> Elizabeth's supporters in the government, however, among them [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget| Lord Paget]], convinced Mary to spare her sister, for lack of proof. On 22 May, therefore, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of [[Sir Henry Bedingfield]]. Crowds cheered her all along the way.<ref>Loades, 29.<br /><U+2022> "The wives of Wycombe passed cake and wafers to her until her litter became so burdened that she had to beg them to stop." Neale, 49.</ref>

[[Image:Hatfieldhouseoldpalace.jpg|thumb|left|The remaining wing of the Old Palace, [[Hatfield House]]. It was here that Elizabeth was told of her sister's death in November 1558.]]

On [[17 April]] 1555, Elizabeth was recalled to court, so that she could be closely attended during the final stages of Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen; if, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede.<ref>Loades, 29.</ref> When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she would ever have a child.<ref>Loades, 32.</ref> Elizabeth's succession now looked increasingly inevitable.<ref>Somerset, 66.</ref> Even Philip, who became King of Spain on the abdication of his father in 1556, seems to have acknowledged the shift in circumstances, because from this time onwards he cultivated Elizabeth, preferring her to the likely alternative, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], betrothed to the [[Francis II of France| Dauphin of France]].<ref>Neale, 53.</ref> When his wife fell ill in 1558, Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth.<ref>Loades, 33.</ref> By October, with Mary dangerously ill, Elizabeth made plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir.<ref>Neale, 59.<br /><U+2022> Somerset, 71.</ref> A week later, she was dead.

==Queen Elizabeth==

She wears her hair loose, as traditional for the coronation of a queen, perhaps also as a symbol of virginity.<ref>Loades, 34.</ref>]]

On [[20 November]] [[1558]], Elizabeth declared her intentions to her Council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance. The speech contains the first record of her often-used metaphor of the "two bodies": the body natural and the [[body politic]]:

<blockquote>My lords, the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, considering I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring from the bottom of my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all...to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.<ref>Full document reproduced by Loades, 36<U+2013>37.</ref></blockquote>

Elizabeth's [[coronation]] took place on [[15 January]] [[1559]]. She was twenty-five years old. As her [[Royal entry|triumphal progress]] wound through the city on the eve of the ceremony, she was welcomed wholeheartedly by the citizens, and greeted by orations and pageants, most with a strong Protestant flavour, from platforms along the way, most performed by children. Elizabeth's open and gracious responses endeared her to the spectators, who were "wonderfully ravished".<ref>Somerset, 89<U+2013>90. [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 The "Festival Book" account, from the British Library]</ref> The following day, Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey and anointed by the bishop of Carlisle. Then she was presented for the people's acceptance, amidst a deafening noise of organs, fifes, trumpets, drums and bells.<ref>Neale, 70.</ref>

==Religion==
{{main|Elizabethan Religious Settlement}}
{{Anglicanism}}

Elizabeth was left in no doubt that most of her subjects wished her to repudiate the pope and Spanish influence and to establish a Protestant church suited to the needs of the English people.<ref>Loades, 46.</ref> This desire chimed with her own conscience and the policies of Sir William Cecil, her [[Secretary of State]], and her chief advisors. She also knew that the pope would never recognise her as the legitimate child of Henry VIII and the rightful ruler of England.<ref>Somerset, 92.</ref> The parliament of 1559, therefore, legislated for a Protestant church based on the settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head.<ref>Loades, 46.</ref> The [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] strongly backed the new proposals, but the bill of supremacy faced opposition in the [[House of Lords]], particularly from the bishops, though Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the [[Archbishop of Canterbury| archbishopric of Canterbury]]<ref>"It was fortunate that ten out of twenty-six bishoprics were vacant, for of late there had been a high rate of mortality among the episcopate, and a fever had conveniently carried off Mary's Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Reginald Pole]], less than twenty-four hours after her own death". Somerset, 98.<br /><U+2022> "There were no less than ten sees unrepresented through death or illness and the carelessness of 'the accursed cardinal' [Pole]". Black, 10.</ref> The Protestant peers were consequently able to outvote the bishops and conservative peers.

After various negotiations and changes to the wording, the new [[Act of Supremacy 1559| Act of Supremacy]] became law on [[8 May]] [[1559]]. Elizabeth's title was agreed to be [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] rather than the more contentious [[Supreme Head]]. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; however, the [[heresy]] laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 [[Book of Common Prayer]] compulsory, though the penalties for disobedience were not extreme.<ref>Somerset, 101<U+2013>103.</ref> 

Many Catholics, particularly on the continent, regarded Elizabeth as a heretic. In 1570, [[Pius V| Pope Pius V]] [[Excommunication| excommunicated]] her, calling her the "pretended queen of England". This sanction, which in theory released English Catholics from allegiance to Elizabeth, only served to identify membership of the [[Anglican]] church more closely with loyalty to the crown. It also placed English Catholics in greater danger, encouraging them to rebel and raising doubts about their allegiance to the monarchy.<ref>Hogg, 46<U+2013>47.</ref>

==Marriage question==
[[Image:Dudleyportrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]], attributed to Steven van der Meulen, 1560s. Elizabeth's friendship with Dudley, her foremost [[favourite]], lasted for over thirty years.]]

From the start of Elizabeth's reign, the question arose of whom she would marry. In fact, she never married, and the reasons for that are not clear. Historians have speculated that [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile.<ref>Loades, 38.<br /><U+2022> Haigh, 19.</ref> However, no evidence suggests that she ever made a conscious decision not to marry. Until bearing a child ceased to be a realistic possibility, she considered a number of options, the last being [[Fran<U+00E7>ois, Duke of Anjou]], in 1581. Elizabeth certainly had no need of a man's help to govern; and marrying involved the risk of losing control or of foreign interference in her affairs, as had happened to her sister Mary. On the other hand, marriage had the advantage that she might produce an heir.<ref>Loades, 39.</ref>

Elizabeth constantly received offers of marriage, but she only seriously considered three or four suitors for any length of time. Of these, her childhood friend [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester| Robert Dudley]] probably came closest. During 1559, Elizabeth's friendship with the married Dudley seems to have turned to love, and rumours, very probably false, spread that she was sleeping with him.<ref>Loades, 42.</ref> William Cecil, Elizabeth's most trusted advisor, made clear his disapproval. When Dudley's wife, [[Amy Robsart| Amy]], was found dead in 1560, almost certainly of natural causes but in suspicious circumstances, a great scandal arose.<ref>In April 1559, [[Amy Robsart| Amy Dudley]] had been reported as suffering from a "malady in one of her breasts", and it is now assumed that she had cancer. At the time, it was widely believed that Dudley had done away with her in order to marry the queen. Somerset, 166<U+2013>67.</ref> For a time, Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley. After several months, however, she put duty ahead of her feelings and decided against the marriage. Though Dudley, whom she made Earl of Leicester and appointed to the [[Privy Council]], retained a special place in her heart, infatuation was superseded in time by a special and lasting friendship. After Elizabeth died, a note from Dudley, who had died in 1588, was found among her possessions, marked "his last letter".<ref>Loades, 42<U+2013>45.</ref>

After the Dudley affair, Elizabeth kept the marriage question open, but often only as a diplomatic ploy.<ref name ="H17">Haigh, 17.</ref> She appears to have considered marriage out of duty rather than personal preference, having been repeatedly petitioned to marry by Parliament, but she always answered evasively.<ref>Loades, 40.</ref>  In 1563, she told an imperial envoy: "If I follow the inclination of my nature, it is this: beggar-woman and single, far rather than queen and married".<ref name ="H17">Haigh, 17.</ref>  In the same year, however, following a bout with smallpox, the succession question became a heated issue, and she was encouraged by Parliament that she marry or nominate an heir to prevent [[civil war]] upon her death. She refused to do either, and in April, she [[Prorogation|prorogued]] Parliament which did not reconvene until Elizabeth needed its assent to raise taxes in 1566. The [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] threatened to withhold funds until the she agreed to provide for the succession and on [[October 19]], [[1566]], [[Sir Robert Bell]], commented boldly, on the unsatisfactory answer returned and pursued the issue despite Elizabeth's command to desist; in her own words "Mr. Bell with his complices must needs prefer their speeches to the upper house to have you my lords, consent with them, whereby you were seduced, and of simplicity did assent unto it."<ref>Hasler, 421<U+2013>24.</ref>    
 
In 1566, she confided to the Spanish ambassador that if she could find a way to settle the succession without marrying, she would do so. By 1570, senior figures in the government privately accepted that the queen would never marry; and William Cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem.<ref name ="H17">Haigh, 17.</ref> Elizabeth always refused to name her successor, despite petitions from parliament to do so. For this stance, as for her failure to marry, she was often accused of irresponsibility.<ref>Haigh, 20<U+2013>21.</ref> However, Elizabeth's silence strengthened her own political security: she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would have become vulnerable to a coup.<ref>When in 1566 a parliamentary commission urged Elizabeth to name an heir, she referred to the way "a second person, as I have been" had been used as the focus of plots against her sister, Queen Mary. Haigh, 22<U+2013>23.</ref>

Elizabeth's unmarried status gave rise to a cult of [[virginity]]. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin or a goddess or both, not as a normal woman.<ref name = "Hh">Haigh, 23.</ref> At first, it was only Elizabeth herself who made a virtue of the royal virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, "And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin".<ref name = "Hh">Haigh, 23.</ref> Later on, particularly after 1578, poets and writers took up the theme and turned it into an [[iconography]] that exalted Elizabeth. In an age of [[metaphors]] and [[Conceit| conceits]], she was portrayed as married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection. In 1599, Elizabeth was content to speak of "all my husbands, my good people".<ref>Haigh, 24.</ref>

==Foreign policy==
[[Image:Nicholas Hilliard 002.jpg|thumb| [[Fran<U+00E7>ois, Duke of Anjou]], by [[Nicholas Hilliard]]. Elizabeth called the duke her "frog", finding him "not so deformed" as she had been led to expect.<ref>Frieda, 397.</ref>]]

Dudley apart, Elizabeth seems to have treated the marriage issue as an aspect of foreign policy.<ref>Loades, 51.</ref> She chose at first to continue the existing alliance with [[Philip II of Spain]] and the [[Habsburg]] empire. Though she turned down Philip's own offer of marriage, she engaged for several years in negotiations to marry his cousin [[Charles II of Austria| Archduke Charles of Austria]], the son of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor| Emperor Ferdinand I]]. However, relations with the Habsburgs deteriorated by 1568, after which Elizabeth negotiated potential marriage alliances with two French [[House of Valois| Valois]] princes, first with [[Henry III of France| Henri, Duke of Anjou]], and later, on and off from 1572 to 1581, with his brother [[Fran<U+00E7>ois, Duke of Anjou]], who visited England to court her in 1579.<ref>Loades, 53<U+2013>54.</ref> This last proposal, tied to a planned alliance against Spanish control of the [[Southern Netherlands| Netherlands]], was unpopular now that Elizabeth was past childbearing age.<ref>Loades, 54.</ref> Nevertheless, she took the courtship seriously for a time and even wore a frog-shaped earring that Anjou had sent her.<ref>Somerset, 408.</ref>

[[Image:Autograph of Elizabeth I of England (from Nordisk familjebok).png|thumb|left| Signature of Elizabeth I of England]]

With the exception of a disastrous occupation of [[Le Havre]] from October 1562 to June 1563, when Elizabeth's [[Huguenot]] allies briefly joined with the Catholics to retake the port, Elizabeth's foreign policy was defensive.<ref>Elizabeth's had intended to exchange Le Havre for [[Calais]], retaken by France in January 1558. Frieda, 191.</ref> She intervened in Scotland in 1560 to prevent the French using it as a base.<ref>Loades, 55.</ref> In 1585, she signed the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] with the Dutch in the face of a Spanish domination of the Low Countries that exposed England to invasion.<ref>Haigh, 135.</ref> Only in supporting the global expansionism of her merchants and fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. This support paid off handsomely in the war against Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea, where English sea power dominated.<ref>Loades, 61.</ref> Seafaring was a crucial dimension of Elizabeth<U+2019>s military and economic policy.

===Mary, Queen of Scots===
[[Image:Mary Stuart Queen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. School of [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Clouet]].]]

Elizabeth's first policy toward Scotland was to remove the French presence there.<ref>Haigh, 131.</ref> She feared that the French intended to invade England and put [[Mary I of Scotland| Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was heir to the English crown until such time as Elizabeth had children,<ref>Mary's position as heir derived from her great grandfather [[Henry VII of England| Henry VII]], through [[Henry VIII of England| Henry VIII's]] sister [[Margaret Tudor]]. In her own words, "I am the nearest kinswoman she hath, being both of us of one house and stock, the Queen my good sister coming of the brother, and I of the sister". Guy, 115.</ref> on the English throne.<ref>On Elizabeth's accession, Mary's [[Counts and Dukes of Guise| Guise]] relatives had pronounced her Queen of England and had the English arms emblazoned with those of Scotland and France on her plate and furniture. Guy, 96<U+2013>97.</ref> Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to support the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]], of July 1560, by which both British and French troops withdrew from Scotland, removed the French threat in the north.<ref>Haigh, 132.</ref> When Mary returned to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth.<ref>Loades, 67.</ref> She refused to ratify the treaty.<ref>Loades, 68.</ref>

When Elizabeth tried to influence Mary's choice of marriage partner by suggesting her own former suitor, Robert Dudley, she only caused offence.<ref>Loades, 68.</ref> Instead, in 1565 Mary married [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], who had his own claim to the English throne. This marriage, however, was the first of a series of errors of judgement which were to hand the intitiative to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley became at first unpopular in Scotland and then infamous for presiding over the murder of Mary's Italian secretary [[David Rizzio]]. In February 1567, Darnley was himself murdered by conspirators almost certainly led by [[James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell]], who shortly afterward married Mary on [[15 May]] [[1567]], raising suspicions that Mary had been party to the murder. Elizabeth wrote to Mary:

<blockquote>How could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.<ref>Letter to Mary, Queen of Scots, [[23 June]] [[1567]]. Quoted by Loades, 69<U+2013>70.</ref></blockquote>

These events led rapidly to Mary's defeat and imprisonment in [[Loch Leven Castle]], where she was forced to abdicate in favour of her son [[James I of England| James]], born in June 1566. James was taken to [[Stirling Castle]] to be brought up as a Protestant. Mary escaped from Loch Leven in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had always been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore Mary. This was, however, also her moment of victory, since her deadly rival was now delivered into her custody. Rather than take the risk of returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, Elizabeth and her Council made the safer decision to detain her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.<ref>Loades, 72<U+2013>73.</ref>

Mary was soon the focus for rebellion. In 1569, plotters in the [[Rising of the North]] talked of freeing her, and a scheme arose to marry her to [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk| Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk]]. Elizabeth sent Howard to the block. Mary may not have known about all the Catholic plots to put her on the English throne, but from the [[Ridolfi Plot]] of 1571 to the [[Babington Plot]] of 1586, a case mounted against her, keenly compiled by the queen's spymaster [[Francis Walsingham| Sir Francis Walsingham]] and the royal Council.<ref>Loades, 73.</ref> At first, Elizabeth resisted calls for Mary's death, but by late 1586 she was persuaded to sanction her trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the Babington Plot.<ref>Guy, 483<U+2013>84.</ref> Elizabeth's proclamation of the sentence announced that "...the said Mary, pretending title to the same Crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm divers things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person...".<ref>Loades, 78<U+2013>79.</ref> On [[8 February]] [[1587]], Mary was beheaded at [[Fotheringay Castle]], Northamptonshire, at the age of forty-four.<ref>Guy, 1<U+2013>11.</ref>

===Spain===

{{main|Spanish Armada}}
{{main|Anglo<U+2013>Spanish War (1585)}}

After the disastrous occupation and loss of [[Le Havre]] in 1562<U+2013>1563, Elizabeth avoided military expeditions on the continent until 1585. In that year, she sent an English army to aid the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip II. This followed the deaths in 1584 of the allies [[William the Silent| William the Silent, Prince of Orange]], and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois, Duke of Anjou]], and the surrender of a series of Dutch towns to [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], Philip's Governor of the [[Southern Netherlands| Spanish Netherlands]]. In December 1584, an alliance between Philip II and the French [[Catholic League (French)| Catholic League]] at [[Treaty of Joinville| Joinville]] undermined the ability of Anjou's brother, [[Henry III of France]], to counter Spanish domination of the Netherlands. It also extended Spanish influence along the [[English Channel| channel]] coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion.<ref>Haigh, 135.</ref> The English and the Dutch reacted in August 1585 with the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]], by which Elizabeth, pressed by her advisors, promised military support to the Dutch. The treaty marked the beginning of the [[Anglo<U+2013>Spanish War (1585)| Anglo-Spanish War]], which lasted until 1604 and the [[Treaty of London (1604)| Treaty of London]].

Elizabeth distrusted this commitment from the start. The expedition, led by her old flame, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester| Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]], achieved nothing.<ref>Haigh, 134.</ref> Elizabeth's strategy, to use the English army as a defensive bargaining tool, was soon at odds with that of Dudley, who wanted to fight an active campaign but lacked the resources to do so. He enraged Elizabeth by accepting from the Dutch [[States-General of the Netherlands| States-General]] the post of Governor-General, which Elizabeth saw as a Dutch ploy to embroil her further in their affairs.<ref>Haigh, 137.</ref> She wrote to him:

<blockquote>We could never have imagined (had we not seen it fall out in experience) that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour....And therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name. Whereof fail you not, as you will answer the contrary at your utmost peril.<ref>Letter to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, [[10 February]] [[1586]], delivered by [[Thomas Heneage| Sir Thomas Heneage]]. Loades, 94.</ref></blockquote>

Elizabeth and her parliament's reluctance to send Dudley sufficient money and troops, combined with his own incompetence as a military leader, doomed the campaign to impotence. Dudley finally resigned his command in December 1587, his reputation in tatters. By that time, Philip II had decided to take the war to England itself.<ref>Haigh, 138.</ref>

[[Image:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elizabeth to commemorate the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] (1588), depicted in the background. Elizabeth's hand rests on the globe, symbolising her international power.]]

On [[12 July]] [[1588]], the [[Spanish Armada]], a great fleet of ships, set sail for the channel, planning to ferry a Spanish invasion force under the Duke of Parma to the coast of south-east England from the Netherlands. The armada, however, was defeated by a combination of miscalculation,<ref>When the Spanish naval commander, the [[Alonso de Guzm<U+00E1>n El Bueno, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia| Duke of Medina Sidonia]], reached the coast near Calais, he found the Duke of Parma's troops unready and was forced to wait, giving the English the opportunity to launch their attack. Loades, 64.</ref> misfortune, and an attack of English [[fire ships]] on 1 August off [[Gravelines]] which dispersed the Spanish ships to the north east. The armada straggled home to Spain in shattered remnants, after disastrous losses on the coast of Ireland.<ref>Neale, 300.</ref> Unaware of the armada's fate, English forces mustered to defend the country. Elizabeth inspected her troops at [[Tilbury]] in [[Essex]] on 8 August. Wearing a silver breastplate over a white velvet dress, she addressed them in [[Speech to the Troops at Tilbury| one of her most famous speeches]]:

<blockquote>My loving people, we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people....I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.<ref>Somerset, 591.<br /><U+2022> Neale, 297<U+2013>98.</ref></blockquote>

When no invasion came, the nation rejoiced. Elizabeth's procession to a thanksgiving service at [[St Paul's Cathedral| St Paul's]] rivalled that of her coronation as a spectacle.<ref>Neale, 300.</ref> The defeat of the armada was a potent propaganda victory, both for Elizabeth and for Protestant England. The English took their delivery as a symbol of God's favour and of the nation's inviolabilty under a virgin queen.<ref>Loades, 61.</ref> However, the victory was not a turning point in the war, which continued and often favoured Spain. The Spanish still controlled the Netherlands, and the threat of invasion remained.<ref>Haigh, 138.</ref>

===France===

When the Protestant [[Henry IV of France]] inherited the French throne in 1589, Elizabeth sent him military support, her first venture into France since the ignominious retreat from [[Le Havre]] in 1563. Henry's succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports. The subsequent English campaigns in France, however, were disorganised and ineffective.<ref>Haigh, 142.</ref> [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby| Lord Willoughby]], largely ignoring Elizabeth's orders, roamed northern France with an army of 4,000 men, to little effect, and withdrew in disarray in December 1589, having lost half his troops. In 1591, [[John Norreys| Sir John Norreys]] led 3,000 men to [[Brittany]], and his campaign was even more of a disaster.<ref>Haigh, 143.</ref> As for all such expeditions, Elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders. Norreys left for London to plead for more support, and in his absence, a Catholic League army almost destroyed the remains of his army at Craon in May 1591. In July, Elizabeth sent out another force under [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex| Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex]], to help Henry IV in besieging [[Rouen]]; but the result was just as dismal. Essex accomplished nothing and returned home in January 1592.<ref>Henry abandoned the siege in April. Haigh, 143.</ref> As usual, Elizabeth lacked any control over her commanders once they were abroad. "Where he is, or what he doth, or what he is to do," she wrote of Essex, "we are ignorant".<ref>Haigh, 143<U+2013>44.</ref>

===Ireland===

Although Ireland was one of her two kingdoms, Elizabeth faced a hostile, and in places virtually autonomous,<ref>One observer wrote that [[Ulster]], for example, was "as unknown to the English here as the most inland part of Virginia". Somerset, 667.</ref> Catholic population in Ireland that was willing to plot with her enemies. Her policy there was to grant land to her courtiers and ensure that Philip II could not ally with Irish rebels against the crown.<ref>Loades, 55.</ref> In response to a series of uprisings, the English forces pursued scorched-earth tactics, burning the land and slaughtering man, woman and child. During a rebellion in [[Munster]] led by [[Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond| Gerald FitzGerald, Earl of Desmond]], in 1582, an estimated 30,000 Irish citizens died of starvation. The poet [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote that the local people "were brought to such wretchedness as that any stony heart would have rued the same".<ref>Somerset, 668.</ref> Elizabeth always advised her commanders that the Irish, "that rude and barbarous nation", be well treated, but she showed no remorse when force and bloodshed were deemed necessary.<ref>Somerset, 668<U+2013>69.</ref>

Between 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth faced her most severe test in Ireland, with the revolt known as [[Nine Years War| Tyrone's Rebellion, or the Nine Years War]], led by the [[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone| Earl of Tyrone, Hugh O'Neill]], and backed by Spain.<ref>Loades, 98.</ref> In spring 1599, she sent [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], to suppress the rebellion, but, to her frustration,<ref>In a letter of [[19 July]] [[1599]] to Essex, Elizabeth wrote: "For what can be more true (if things be rightly examined) than that your two month's journey has brought in never a capital rebel against whom it had been worthy to have adventured one thousand men". Loades, 98.</ref> he made little progress, returned to England without permission, and had to be replaced by [[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire| Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy]], who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered a few days after Elizabeth's death in 1603.<ref>Loades, 98<U+2013>99.</ref>

==Later years and death==

[[Image:Devereaux essex4.jpg|thumb| [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], by William Segar, 1590.]]

As Elizabeth aged and a marriage became unlikely, her image gradually changed. She was portrayed as [[Belphoebe]] or [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], and after the Armada, as [[Gloriana]], the eternally youthful [[Faerie Queene]] of [[Edmund Spenser| Edmund Spenser's]] poem. Her painted portraits became less a realistic likeness and more a set of enigmatic [[iconography| icons]] which made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been damaged by [[smallpox]] in 1562, which left her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics.<ref>Loades, 92; Gaunt, 37.</ref> However, the more Elizabeth's beauty faded, the more her courtiers praised it.<ref>Loades, 92.</ref> 

Elizabeth was happy to act the part; but it is possible that in the last decade of her life she became self-deceived.<ref>Loades, 93.</ref> She was markedly fond of and indulgent towards the charming but petulant Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who treated her without the usual courtly restraint, for which she always forgave him.<ref>Loades, 93.</ref> Despite his irresponsility, she repeatedly appointed him to military posts. After his desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, however, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest for a time and the following year deprived him of his [[monopolies]].<ref>Loades, 97.</ref> In February 1601, Essex tried to raise a rebellion in London, intending to seize the queen's person, but few rallied to his support, and he was sent to the block on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. After Essex's execution, she was recorded as remaining melancholy until her death in 1603.<ref>Loades, 100.</ref>

The monopolies Elizabeth reclaimed from Essex were her typical method of rewarding courtiers in the last years of her reign. A Patent of Monopoly gave the holder control over an aspect of trade or manufacture, and this led to artificial prices and the enrichment of courtiers at the public's expense. The result was agitation in the House of Commons and widespread criticism of the queen's practice of granting monopolies. Elizabeth had come to rely on this cost-free system of patronage rather than asking Parliament for subsidies. In her famous "Golden Speech" to the Commons of [[30 November]] [[1601]], she professed innocence of the problem and resorted, as usual, to emotional appeal:

<blockquote>Who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess. And as nothing is more dear to us than the loving conservation of our subjects' hearts, what an undeserved doubt might we have incurred if the abusers of our liberality, the thrallers of our people, the wringers of the poor, had not been told us!<ref>Loades, 86.</ref></blockquote> 

In 1598, Elizabeth's chief advisor, Lord Burghley, died. His political mantle was inherited by his son, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], who had previously become Secretary of State in 1590.

The succession to the throne had been the ultimate political concern in England since Mary Stuart's arrival in Scotland in the 1560s, and by the end of the century there was only one question in the minds of Elizabeth's advisors: who next? It is in this context that the behaviour of Essex is best explained. In 1601, he led a revolt against the Queen, but popular support was curiously lacking, and the former darling of the masses was executed.

Although the last fifteen years of Elizabeth's reign were darkened by political misfortunes, they were also backlit by the artistic glories of the age of [[Philip Sidney|Sidney]], [[Spenser]], [[Marlowe]] and [[Shakespeare]], by the navigational achievements of Drake and Hawkins, and by the establishment of the first colony in Virginia, named after her. This period had begun with the repulsion of the Spanish Armada, which secured Elizabeth's authority as a Protestant monarch; it ended with the melancholy of old age and the increasing cynicism of a Court that had grown stale. Yet Elizabeth contrived some of her greatest speeches in the autumn of her reign.

[[Image:Elizabeth-I-Allegorical-Po.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Allegory|Allegorical Portrait]]'' of Elizabeth I, painted after her death by an unknown artist, c. 1610. [[Old Father Time]] sits on her right and [[The Grim Reaper|Death]] looks over her left shoulder. Two [[Cherubs]] remove the crown from her head.]]

The Queen's health remained good until the autumn of 1602, when a series of losses among her remaining friends appeared to throw her into a melancholy. In her depression, she was lethargic and silent, quite unlike her usual brisk manner. Her courtiers anxiously tried to cheer her, but as she admonished her godson, [[John Harington]], "When thou dost feel creeping time at thy gate, these fooleries will please thee less." She withdrew to Richmond Palace and to her bedchamber, lying on cushions on the floor and taking no nourishment. To Robert Cecil, insisting she ''must'' go to bed, she flared, "Little man, little man, the word 'must' is not to be used to Princes." Elizabeth became silent and lethargic. 

On [[March 21]], [[1603]], the Lord Admiral finally persuaded the Queen to go to bed. She could no longer speak. Robert Cecil later alleged that she wordlessly signed to him that James VI of Scotland, son of Mary of Scotland, would be her heir. On March 24, with the Archbishop of Canterbury on his knees by her bed, praying with her women for her soul, she died, between two and three o'clock in the morning.<ref>Strickland, Agnes, ''Lives of the Queens of England'', Vol. 8, Philadelph1a, 1902, p. 377<U+2013>78</ref> 
Elizabeth had ruled England for more than 44 years, and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]]. A horseman was already travelling north to Scotland, and James VI.

The will of Henry VIII had declared that Elizabeth was to be succeeded by the descendants of his younger sister, [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk]], rather than by the Scottish descendants of his elder sister, [[Margaret Tudor]]. If the will were upheld, then Elizabeth would have been succeeded by [[Lady Anne Stanley]]. If, however, the rules of [[primogeniture]] were upheld, the successor would be James VI, King of Scotland. Still other claimants were possible; they included [[Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp of Hache]] (the quasi-legitimate son of the Lady Catherine Grey) and [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]] (Lady Anne Stanley's uncle).

James VI was proclaimed King of England as [[James I of England|James I]] a few hours after Elizabeth's death on [[March 24]], [[1603]], signalling the end of the [[Tudor Dynasty]] and the start of the reign of the [[House of Stuart]] in the [[Kingdom of England]].

Elizabeth's reign remains a controversial topic. Elizabeth proved to be one of the most popular monarchs in English or British history. She placed seventh in the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' poll, which was conducted by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] in 2002, outranking all other British monarchs. In 2005, in the [[History Channel]] documentary ''Britain's Greatest Monarch'', a group of historians and commentators analysed twelve British monarchs and gave them overall marks out of 60 for greatness (they were marked out of 10 in six categories, such as military prowess and legacy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/tv_guide/full_details/British_history/programme_2652.php|title="Britain's Greatest Monarch", ''The History Channel''}}</ref> Elizabeth I was the winner, with 48 points.

Many historians have recently taken a less favourable view of Elizabeth's reign, and contemporary Elizabethan biographies and studies of the Tudor period have increasingly cast doubt on the above assessments [e.g. Somerset, Guy, Haigh, Ridley, Elton]. Elizabethan England was generally unsuccessful militarily, and recurring military failures against England's three primary foreign adversaries of the period <U+2013> France, Ireland and Spain <U+2013> had serious historical repercussions. England was permanently expelled from its Continental territories following defeat of Elizabeth's armies against France, while the guerrilla war against Ireland late in her reign proved to be politically and financially disastrous. Though England achieved some early victories against Spain, the navy and army both were consistently defeated by Spanish forces in the years after the Armada for the duration of the [[Anglo<U+2013>Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], enabling Spain to gain dominance of the seas for another half-century while frustrating English attempts to establish overseas colonies. The wars also seriously endangered English finances and mired the kingdom in substantial debt and loss of collateral by 1603.

Thus Elizabeth had far less military success than other English or British monarchs such as [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], [[Alfred the Great]] or of course the Norman-born [[William the Conqueror]]. Furthermore, her own grandfather and founder of the Tudor dynasty, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], ultimately proved more successful in bestowing a solvent treasury to his successors, while funding a maritime expedition (by [[John Cabot]]) to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] which resulted in the first English claim to overseas territory as well as seasonal visits to the region's fishing grounds. Despite her long period in power, Elizabeth was unable to build on Cabot's territorial claims with permanent overseas settlements; these were initiated later under the Stuart kings, following treaty negotiations with Spain in 1604. The bloody and damaging conflicts in Elizabethan Ireland, the deterioration of English finances late in the reign, the sale of offices to finance wars and even Elizabeth's role as a sponsor of the first English slave trader, Sir [[John Hawkins]], have been cited as additional grounds for contemporary criticism.

In other important respects though, Elizabeth was a successful monarch, and recent treatments of her and the other Tudors do generally credit her with helping to steady the nation even after inheriting a significant national debt from her half-sister Mary, while patronising the arts in the manner of Henry VIII during his reign. Furthermore, despite the successful landing and attack by [[Carlos de Am<U+00E9>squita|Don Amesquita's]] Spanish soldiers on western England in 1595, the country managed to escape other Spanish invasions that could have been far more crippling. Moreover, Elizabeth was also able to prevent the outbreak of a religious or civil war on English soil despite the turmoil following Henry VIII's break from [[Rome]], in contrast for example to the divisive religious conflict then gripping France in which English soldiers themselves later became involved.

In terms of Elizabeth's reputation as a champion of the Protestant cause, for many years after her death, her Accession Day of November was celebrated by Pope-burning processions.<ref>G. M. Trevelyan, ''England under the Stuarts'' (Routledge, 2002), pp. 393<U+2013>4.</ref> Her achievements in this regard, however, were greatly magnified after her death. Although she was often depicted in later years as a great defender of Protestantism in Europe, in reality she often wavered before coming to the aid of her Protestant allies for a variety of reasons. As Sir Walter said in relation to her foreign policy, "Her Majesty did all by halves."
