== History ==
{{main|History of the euro}}
The euro was set up on 1 January 1999, when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe.<ref name="Introduction"></ref> For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountance. Euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the banknotes and coins of the eurozone 12, as it was then, national currencies like the [[Irish Pound]] and the [[Austrian schilling]].<ref name="Introduction"></ref>

=== Changes ===
There has so far only been one series of euro notes, however a new series similar to the current one is to be issued from 2011.<ref name="Banknotes index"></ref> The initial issue of notes bears the signature of the first [[President of the European Central Bank|president]] of the [[European Central Bank]], [[Wim Duisenberg]], who was replaced on 1 November 2003 by [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], whose signature appears on subsequent issues.<ref name="Banknotes index"></ref>
