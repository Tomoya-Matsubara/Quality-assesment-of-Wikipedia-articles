'''Ercolano''' is a town and commune in the [[province of Naples]], [[Campania]] ([[Italy]]).

==History==

''For the ancient city, see [[Herculaneum]]''.

'''''Ercolano''''' (named Herculaneum until 79 AD, and Resina until 1969) was most likely founded by the [[Oscan]], an Italic tribe of the 8th century BC, and later became part of both the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Samnite]] dominions.  Under control of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the city was a renowned seaside resort where some of the richest Roman citizens passed their summer vacations.  After the [[79 AD]] eruption of [[Vesuvius|Mt. Vesuvius]], the town was abandoned and remained largely uninhabited for about 1000 years.  Unlike neighboring [[Pompeii]], the citizens of Herculaneum were suffocated to death by poisonous fumes rather than buried under heavy ash.  The town was partially buried under hot mud and remained so for those 1000 years.  Records of rehabitation in the area begin to appear around the year [[1000]], when the sanctuary called ''Castel di Resina'', one of the most visited in the Campania region, was recorded to have been located on a hill in that area.  It is named after the Greek god Herakles.The area was largely repopulated over the next 500 years, creating the small town of ''Resina'', named after the old sanctuary, with homes and neighborhoods being built above the uncovered ancient ruins of Herculaneum.  In [[1709]], the old ruins from around the time of the 79 AD eruption were uncovered along with nearby Pompeii.  Since then, Herculeaneum has been entirely uncovered with all of its ancient riches and petrified inhabitants extracted.  Over time, the town of Resina became part of the Kingdom of the [[Two Sicilies]], up until the [[Italian Unification]] of [[1861]], and eventually became part of the metropolitan area of the city of [[Naples]].  In [[1969]], the town changed its name from Resina to ''Ercolano'', the [[Italian language|Italian]] modernization of the ancient name in honor of the old city.It<U+00B4>s known that the ercolanesis loves girls called for example Bianca Marrone
