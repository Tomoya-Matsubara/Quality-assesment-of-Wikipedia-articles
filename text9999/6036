'''Redlining''' is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as [[banking]], [[insurance]], access to jobs,<ref>[http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities]</ref> access to health care,<ref>See: [[Race and health]]</ref>  or even [[supermarkets]]<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition], Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] 	Volume 53, Number 2 / February, 2001</ref> to residents in certain, often racially determined,<ref name="eastny">[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0814782671. Page 42.</ref> areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]]. The term "redlining" was coined in the late 1960s by community activists in Chicago.  It describes the practice of marking a red line on a map to delineate the area where banks would not invest. During the heyday of redlining these areas were most frequently minority [[inner city]] neighborhoods.

==History of the practice==
Redlining began in the [[United States]] with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]] which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA). In 1935, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) asked [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real estate investments in each surveyed city. In these maps many minority neighborhoods in cities were not eligible to receive loans at all. This meant that [[ethnic minorities]] could secure [[mortgage loan]]s only in certain areas, and it resulted in a large increase in the residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States. Urban Planning historians theorize that the maps were used for years afterwards to deny loans to people in black communities by private and public entities.

On the maps the most affluent areas, those considered desirable for lending purposes, were outlined in blue and known as "Type A". "Type B" neighborhoods were less well off and outlined in yellow. "Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red on the map. Most of the [[List of U.S. metropolitan areas with large African-American populations|Black neighborhoods]] were characterized as "Type D" and were considered to be the worst for lending.

Some redlined maps were also created by private organizations, such as J.M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia. The maps created by private organizations were designed to meet the requirements of the [[Federal Housing Administration]] Underwriting Manual. The manual encouraged lenders to consider these standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "inharmonious racial groups" and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances as well as covenants prohibiting black owners.<ref>''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill & Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]</ref><ref>[http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html "Racial" Provisions of FHA Underwriting Manual, 1938] <blockquote>Recommended restrictions should include provision for the following:
Prohibition of the occupancy of properties '''except by the race for which they are intended''' <U+2026>Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by '''inharmonious racial groups'''.

Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods still received fewer loans, even after accounting for businesses density, businesses size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses.<ref>''Redlining Redux'' Urban Affairs Review, Vol. 38, No. 1, 22<U+2013>41 (2002)</ref> Gregory D.

==Challenges to redlining==
In the [[United States]], the practice was fought through passage of the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of [[1977]], which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival] By Paul S. Grogan, Tony Proscio. ISBN 0813339529. Published 2002. Page 114.<blockquote>The goal was not to relax lending restrictions but rather to get banks to apply the same criteria in the inner-city as in the [[suburbs]].</blockquote></ref> 

The private sector fight against redlining is generally acknowledged as having been led by [[ShoreBank]], a community development bank in [[Chicago's]] [[South Shore]] neighborhood.<ref name="shorebank">Douthwaite, Richard.
