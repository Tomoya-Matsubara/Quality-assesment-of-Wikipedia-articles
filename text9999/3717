'''''Summerteeth''''' is the third [[studio album]] by [[Chicago]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Wilco]]. Released through [[Reprise Records]] on [[March 9]], [[1999]], the album was heavily influenced lyrically by twentieth century literature, as well as singer [[Jeff Tweedy]]'s marital problems. Unlike previous albums, ''Summerteeth'' was heavily overdubbed in the studio with [[Pro Tools]]. Tweedy and [[Jay Bennett]] created most of the album in the studio, a contrast to the band's previous albums. 

The album sold approximately 200,000 copies, a modest number compared to the sales of 1996's ''[[Being There (album)|Being There]]''. This was despite critical acclaim from outlets such as [[All Music Guide]], ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', and ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Wilco agreed to remix one of the songs to cater to radio stations, but the single failed to attain substantial airplay. 

==Production==
[[Wilco]] released ''[[Being There (album)|Being There]]'' in 1996 to a considerably higher level of critical and commercial success than their debut album, ''[[A.M. (album)|A.M.]]''. After the promotional tour to support ''Being There'', Wilco began to record tracks for a third album. The ''Summerteeth'' recording sessions occurred in November 1997 at [[Willie Nelson]]'s music studio in [[Spicewood]], [[Texas]]. Lead singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] was particularly emotional during the sessions because he was upset that he was unable to spend time with his wife and son because of the constant touring schedule.<ref name="Kot1">Kot 2004. p. 138</ref> As a result, the songs recorded reflected an introspective view that was also influenced by literature that Tweedy was reading at the time. While touring, Tweedy would read books by [[Henry Miller]], [[William H. Gass]], and [[John Fante]]. According to Tweedy:<ref>Kot 2004 p. 136</ref>

{{cquote|I definitely wanted to get better at writing, and those things happened simultaneously with trying to read better. I would write tons of stuff in my head, and forget. Some songs on ''Being There'', I don't think I ever wrote any lyrics down ... To fight that, I started writing words on paper and making up melodies to go with them. By writing things down, and putting more words into my head, it put more words in my mouth when I turned on the tape recorder to sing.}}

The sessions yielded a number of songs, including "I'm Always in Love", "She's a Jar", and the Henry Miller-inspired [[murder ballad]] "Via Chicago".<ref name="Kot1"/> Tweedy's relationship with his wife Sue Miller became the inspiration for several of the songs, although she was portrayed mostly in a negative sense. Miller was reluctantly willing to give Tweedy the creative license to write songs, but was concerned about lyrics such as "she begs me not to hit her" from "She's a Jar". To complement the "bold, but depressing" lyrics of ''Summerteeth'', Tweedy relied more heavily on the production skills of [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Jay Bennett]]. However, before the album was completed, Wilco decided to collaborate with [[Billy Bragg]] on the album that would become ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]''.<ref>Kot 2004. pp. 140-1</ref>

Once the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions were completed, Wilco returned to Spicewood to finish ''Summerteeth''. Tweedy and Bennett wanted to start the recording sessions over by experimenting with a new approach to mixing the songs. Unlike previous material, which was performed live in the studio, the pair heavily overdubbed many of the songs with [[Pro Tools]]. As a result, the contributions of other members were diminished.<ref>Kot 2004. pp. 154-5</ref> To compliment the lyrics, Bennett played on a variety of instruments, including [[Mellotron]], [[tambourine]], [[synthesizer]]s<U+2014>he even played the [[bass guitar]] and [[drum]]s when bassist [[John Stirratt]] and drummer [[Ken Coomer]] were not in the studio.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 156</ref> Coomer was not pleased about a reduced role in the band:<ref>Kot 2004. p. 157</ref>

{{cquote|It was a circling of the wagons, and John and I felt left out. It was Jeff and Jay feeding off each other not just musically, but other vices. There was a bonding going on, and it didn't just involve music. Jeff didn't go into [[rehab]] [for an addiction to [[painkillers]]], but he should've, [sic] in my opinion. Jay was taking painkillers, [[antidepressants]], and wasn't in much better shape. The band was different. There wasn't really a band, just two guys losing their minds in the studio.}}

After a series of personnel changes, [[Reprise Records]] sought to release a hit single from the album to increase album sales. Wilco agreed to do this "once and once only" on the basis that they wanted to cooperate with the label.<ref>Kot 2004. pp. 163-4</ref> The band and Reprise executives agreed to re-mix "Can't Stand It" to make it more radio-friendly. Within one day, the song was remixed into the version that appeared on ''Summerteeth'', cutting out portions of the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] and adding bells.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 165</ref> "Can't Stand It" failed to cross over from [[adult album alternative|Triple-A]] to [[modern rock]] radio stations.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 166</ref>

==Reception==
''Summerteeth'' peaked at number seventy-eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], failing to exceed the chart success of ''Being There''.<ref>{{cite news|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|date=[[March 27]], [[1999]]}}</ref> However, it was their first album to chart in the top forty in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/|title=UK Top 40 Hit Database|publisher=everyhit.com}} Last accessed [[August 3]], [[2007]].</ref> As of 2003, it had sold only 200,000 copies.<ref>Kot 2004. p. 167</ref> The album placed eighth on the [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll for 1999, and Pitchfork gave it position thirty-one in its list of the best albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres99.php|title=The 1999 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|publisher=''[[The Village Voice]]''}} Last accessed [[August 3]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_7|title=Top 100 Albums of the 1990s|publisher=Pitchfork Media}} Last accessed [[August 4]], [[2007]].</ref>

The album received mostly positive reviews upon its release. Jason Ankeny of [[All Music Guide]] gave the album four-and-a-half stars, lauding its "lush string arrangements and gorgeous harmonies." Ankeny also compared the music on the album to [[The Band]] in their prime.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:oll67ui0o0jf|title=Summerteeth (review)|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]}} Last accessed [[August 3]], [[2007]].</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]] writer Neil Lieberman praised how Wilco "craft[ed] an album as wonderfully ambiguous and beautifully uncertain as life itself, and how Bennett "paint[ed] the album in [[Technicolor]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lieberman|first=Neil|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/23178-summer-teeth|title=Summerteeth (review)|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=[[March 1]], [[1999]]}} Last accessed [[August 3]], [[2007]].</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a two star honorable mention, calling it "old-fashioned tunecraft lacking not pedal steel, who cares, but the concreteness modern popcraft eschews."<ref>{{cite web|last=Chistgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Wilco|title=CG: Wilco|publisher=robertchristgau.com}} Last accessed [[August 3]], [[2007]].</ref> ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' critic [[Greg Kot]] championed the album on his review of the album and ranked it the year's best album, calling it "pop so gorgeous it belies the intricate studio experimentation that brought it to life."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Greg Kot's Top 20 Albums of 1999|publisher=''The Chicago Tribune''|date=[[December 5]], [[1999]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Summerteeth (review)|publisher=''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''|date=[[February 28]], [[1999]]}}</ref>
