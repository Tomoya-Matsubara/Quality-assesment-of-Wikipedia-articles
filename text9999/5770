'''Web Bot''', or the '''Web Bot Project''', refers to an [[Internet bot]] software program that is claimed to be able to predict future events by tracking keywords entered on the Internet. It was created in 1997, originally to predict stock market trends.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6227357/Web-bot-project-makes-prophecy-of-2012-apocalypse.html|title='Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse|last=Chivers|first=Tom|date=24 September 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref> The creator of the Web Bot Project, Clif High, along with his associate George Ure, who call themselves "The Time Monks"<ref name=coasttocoast>{{citeweb|url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2009/07/21|title=Web Bot Predictions|publisher=[[Coast to Coast AM]]|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref>, keep the technology and algorithms largely secret and sell the predictions via the website [http://www.halfpasthuman.com/ halfpasthuman.com].

==Methodology==
High and Ure say that the Web Bot works by using a form of the [[Wisdom of Crowds]], with [[Web spider|spiders]] that search the internet for about 300,000 keywords with emotional context<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1229868823280&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull|title=Digital World: I have seen the future, and it's on the Web|last=Shamah|first=David|date=23 December 2008|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref> and record the preceding and following words to create a "snapshot." Through this, the technology is claimed to be able to examine the [[collective unconscious]] of the world as a whole. It is thus said to be able to predict catastrophic events 60 to 90 days in advance.

===Claimed hits===
The Web Bot is claimed to have predicted several events prior to them occurring, most notably the September 11 attacks and the 2003 Northeastern United States blackout.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.urbansurvival.com/bothit5.htm | title = BotHit5 Power Blackout Fulfills Web Bot Predictions | publisher = Urban Survival Weekly}}</ref> However, many believe the predictions are vague and, at best, pseudoscientific.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.dailycommonsense.com/web-bot-what-is-it-can-it-predict-stuff/ | title = Web Bot, What is it?

===Misses===
*October 7, 2008 - Web Bot predicted that between September 22 and September 27, 2008, precursor events would lead up to a "main turning point date" on October 7, 2008 which would be more significant than the September 11 terrorist attacks and then major emotional turmoil would continue for nearly five months.<ref>[http://www.december212012.com/articles/news/Web_Bot_Predictions_for_2008_2009.htm]</ref>

In reaction to this crisis, administration of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] would have been thrown into major chaos ten days later.<ref name=coasttocoast/><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/167241-the-market-s-current-psychological-map|title=The Market's Current Psychological Map|publisher=[[Seeking Alpha]]|accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref>

===Future predictions===
*Major catastrophe in 2012 - The Web Bot has gained most of its notoriety for contributing to the [[2012 phenomenon]] by predicting that a cataclysm will devastate the planet in the year 2012, possibly a reversing of [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetic poles]] or a small series of nuclear attacks leading up to a major attack on this day. The prediction does not necessarily call for a complete end of the world.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://aphroditeastrology.com/2007/05/web-bot-predictions.html|title=Web Bot Predictions|publisher=Mirror of Aphrodite|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Worlds-expiry-date-21-December-2012/521526/|title=World<U+2019>s expiry date: 21 December 2012?|publisher=ExpressIndia|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/24061/|title= 2012 Disaster Film Director Admits he Scared Himself |publisher=[[The Epoch Times]]|accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.eldia.com.ar/edis/20080427/revistadomingo15.htm|title=El Nostradamus virtual (in Spanish)|publisher=[[El D<U+00ED>a (La Plata)|El D<U+00ED>a]]|accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref>

==Reception==
The [[History Channel]] has discussed Web Bot in its special ''[[Nostradamus Effect]]'' and on other shows featuring predictions about the end of the world.<ref>[http://www.history.com/shows.do?action=detail&episodeId=396904]</ref> A ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' journalist noted that "What interests me more than the bot's accuracy (of which I'm skeptical), is the relentless negativity of its projections. According to the bot, the future is always bleak and steadily worsening."<ref name=taylor/>

Tom Chivers in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' notes three criticisms of the project: "the internet might plausibly reveal group knowledge about the stock market or, conceivably, terror attacks [but] it would be no more capable of predicting a natural disaster than would a Google search, ... the predictions are so vague as to be meaningless, [and] the prophecies become self-distorting."<ref name=telegraph/><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://aphroditeastrology.com/2007/05/web-bot-project-and-2012.html|title=Web Bot Project and 2012|publisher=Mirror of Aphrodite|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref>
