The '''Kushan Empire''' (c. [[1st century|1st]]&ndash;[[3rd century|3rd centuries]]) was a state that at its cultural zenith, [[circa]] [[105]]&ndash;[[250s|250]] CE, extended from what is now [[Tajikistan]] to [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and down into the [[Ganges river]] valley in [[northern India|northern]] [[India]].  The empire was created by the Kushan tribe of the [[Yuezhi]] confederation, believed to be [[Indo-European people]]<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/kush/hd_kush.htm Kushan Empire (ca. 2nd century B.C.<U+2013>3rd century A.D.) | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from the eastern [[Tarim Basin]], [[China]], possibly related to the [[Tocharians]].  They had diplomatic contacts with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]] and [[China]], and for several centuries were at the center of exchange between the East and the West.

==Origins==
Chinese sources describe the ''Guishuang'' (Ch: <U+8CB4><U+971C>), ''i.e.'' the "Kushans", as one of the five aristocratic tribes of the [[Yuezhi]], also spelled Yueh-chi,<ref>For romanized spelling Yueh-chi see: Keay, p. 110.</ref> (Ch: <U+6708><U+6C0F>), a loose confederation of supposedly Indo-European peoples.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/kush/hd_kush.htm Kushan Empire (ca. 2nd century B.C.<U+2013>3rd century A.D.) | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Yuezhi are also generally considered as the easternmost speakers of [[Indo-European languages]], who had been living in the arid grasslands of eastern [[Central Asia]], in modern-day [[Xinjiang]] and [[Gansu]], possibly speaking versions of the [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] language, until they were driven west by the [[Xiongnu]] in [[176 BCE|176]]&ndash;[[160 BCE|160&nbsp;BCE]]. The five tribes constituting the Yuezhi are known in Chinese history as Xi<U+016B>m<U+00EC> (Ch: <U+4F11><U+5BC6>), Guishuang (Ch: <U+8CB4><U+971C>), Shuangmi (Ch: <U+96D9><U+9761>), Xidun (Ch: <U+80B8><U+9813>), and D<U+016B>m<U+00EC> (Ch: <U+90FD><U+5BC6>).

Historian John Keay contextualizes the movements of the Kushan within a larger setting of mass migrations taking place in the region: 
[[Image:Heraios.jpg|thumb|right|Silver tetradrachm of the first known self-declared "Kushan" ("Kossano" on his coins) ruler [[Heraios]] ([[1]]&ndash;[[30]]).]]
[[Image:KushanTamgas.gif<U+200E>|thumb|right|Listing of Kushan royal [[tamgas]]]]
{{Quote|Chinese sources tell of the construction of the Great Wall in the third century BC and the repulse of various marauding tribes.  Forced to head west and eventually south, these tribes displaced others in an ethnic knock-on effect which lasted many decades and spread right across [[Central Asia]].  The [[Parthians]] from [[Iran]] and the [[Greco-Bactrians|Bactrian Greeks]] from [[Bactria]] had both been dislodged by the [[Sakas|Shakas]] coming down from somewhere near the [[Aral Sea]].  But the Shakas had in turn been dislodged by the [[Yuezhi|Yueh-chi]] who had themselves been driven west to [[Xinjiang]] by the [[Xiongnu|Hiung-nu]].  The last, otherwise the [[Huns]], would happily not reach India for a long time. But the Yueh-chi continued to press on the Shakas, and having forced them out of Bactria, it was sections or clans of these Yueh-chi who next began to move down into India in the second half of the first century AD."<ref>Keay, p. 110.</ref>}}

The Yuezhi reached the Hellenic kingdom of [[Greco-Bactria]], in the [[Bactrian]] territory (northernmost Afghanistan and Uzbekistan) around [[135 BC|135&nbsp;BCE]]. The displaced Greek dynasties resettled to the southeast in areas of the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Indus river|Indus]] basin (in present day Pakistan), occupying the western part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].

==Early Kushans==
[[Image:KushanHead.jpg|thumb|200px|Head of a Kushan prince ([[Khalchayan]] palace, [[Uzbekistan]]).]] 
Some traces remain of the presence of the Kushan in the area of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]]. Archaeological structures are known in Takht-I-Sangin, [[Surkh Kotal]] (a monumental temple), and in the palace of [[Khalchayan]]. Various sculptures and friezes are known, representing horse-riding archers<ref>Lebedynsky, p. 62.</ref>, and significantly men with [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially deformed skulls]], such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan<ref>Lebedynsky, p. 15.</ref> (a practice well attested in nomadic Central Asia). On the ruins of ancient Hellenistic cities such as [[Ai-Khanoum]], the Kushans are known to have built fortresses. The earliest documented ruler, and the first one to proclaim himself as a Kushan ruler was [[Heraios]]. He calls himself a "[[Tyrant]]" on his coins, and also exhibits skull deformation. He may have been an ally of the Greeks, and he shared the same style of coinage. Heraios may have    been the father of the first Kushan emperor [[Kujula Kadphises]].

==A multi-cultural Empire==
In the [[1st century BC|following century]], the ''Guishuang'' (Ch: <U+8CB4><U+971C>) gained prominence over the other Yuezhi tribes, and welded them into a tight confederation under ''yabgu'' (Commander) [[Kujula Kadphises]]. The name ''Guishuang'' was adopted in the West and modified into ''Kushan'' to designate the confederation, although the Chinese continued to call them ''Yuezhi''.

[[Image:KushanDevoteeFullLength.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Buddhist devotee in Kushan dress, Mathura, 2nd century. The Kushan dress is generally depicted as quite stiff, and it is thought it was often made of leather (Francine Tissot, "Gandhara").]]
Gradually wresting control of the area from the [[Indo-Scythians|Scythian]] tribes, the Kushans expanded south into the region traditionally known as [[Gandhara]] (An area lying primarily in Pakistan's Pothowar, and Northwest Frontier Provinces region but going in an arc to include Kabul valley and part of [[Qandahar]] in Afghanistan) and established twin capitals near present-day [[Kabul]] and [[Peshawar]] then known as Kapisa and Pushklavati respectively.

[[Image:Greek alphabet sho.png|thumb|The Kushan writing system used the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of the letter [[Sho (letter)|Sho]].]]

[[Image:Asia 200ad.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Asia in 200 CE (showing the Kushan Empire and its neighbors.]]

The Kushans adopted elements of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture of [[Bactria]]. They adapted the Greek alphabet (often corrupted) to suit their own language (with the additional development of the letter <U+00DE> "sh", as in "Kushan") and soon began minting coinage on the Greek model. On their coins they used Greek language legends combined with Pali legends (in the [[Kharoshthi]] script), until the first few years of the reign of [[Kanishka]]. After that date, they used Kushan language legends (in an adapted Greek script), combined with legends in Greek (Greek script) and legends in Pali ([[Kharoshthi]] script). 

The Kushans are believed to have been predominantly [[Zoroastrian]] and later [[Buddhist]] as well. However, from the time of Wima Takto, many Kushans started adopting aspects of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] like the other nomadic groups who had invaded [[India]], principally the Royal clans of [[Gujjars]]. Like the Egyptians they absorbed the strong remnants of the Greek Culture of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, becoming at least partly Hellenised. The first great Kushan emperor Wima Kadphises may have embraced [[Saivism]], as surmised by coins minted during the period. The following Kushan emperors represented a wide variety of faiths including [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]], and possibly [[Saivism]].

The rule of the Kushans linked the seagoing trade of the Indian Ocean with the commerce of the [[Silk Road]] through the long-civilized [[Indus Valley]]. At the height of the dynasty, the Kushans loosely oversaw a territory that extended to the Aral Sea through present-day Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into northern India. 

The loose unity and comparative peace of such a vast expanse encouraged long-distance trade, brought Chinese silks to [[Rome]], and created strings of flourishing urban centers.

==Territorial expansion==

Direct archaeological evidence of a Kushan rule of long duration is basically available in an area stretching from [[Surkh Kotal]], [[Begram]], the summer capital of the Kushans, [[Peshawar]] the capital under Kanishka I, [[Taxila]] and [[Mathura]], the winter capital of the Kushans.<ref>Rosenfield, p. 41.</ref>

Northward, in the 2nd century CE, the Kushans under [[Kanishka]] made various forays into the [[Tarim Basin]], seemingly the original ground of their ancestors the Yuezhi, where they had various contacts with the Chinese. Both archaeological findins and literary evidence suggest Kushan rule, in [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and [[Hotan|Khotan]].<ref>Rosenfield, p. 41.</ref>

As late as the 3rd century CE, decorated coins of Huvishka were dedicated at [[Bodh Gaya]] together with other gold offerings under the "Enlightenment Throne" of the Buddha, suggesting direct Kushan influence in the area during that period.<ref>British Museum display, Asian Art room.</ref>

==Main Kushan rulers==
===Kujula Kadphises (30<U+2013>80)===
[[Image:KujulaIndoGreekCoinage.jpg|thumb|Tetradrachm of [[Kujula Kadphises]] (30<U+2013>80 CE) in the style of [[King Hermaeus|Hermaeus]].]]
According to the ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'': "the prince (xihou) of Guishuang ([[Badakhshan]] and the adjoining territories north of the [[Oxus]]), named [[Kujula Kadphises]] (Ch: <U+4E18><U+5C31><U+5374>, "Qiujiuque") attacked and exterminated the four other princes (xihou). He set himself up as king of a kingdom called Guishuang."<ref>Hill, John E. 2004. ''The Western Regions according to the Hou Hanshu.'' Draft annotated English translation.[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/hou_han_shu.html]</ref> 

He invaded Anxi (Parthia) and took the Gaofu ([[Kabul]]) region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda, and Jibin (Kapisha-Gandhara). Qiujiuque (Kujula Kadphises) was more than eighty years old when he died."

These conquests probably took place sometime between 45 and 60, and laid the basis for the Kushan Empire which was rapidly expanded by his descendants.

Kujula issued an extensive series of coins and fathered at least two sons, [[Sadashkana|{{unicode|Sada<U+1E63>ka<U+1E47>a}}]] (who is known from only two inscriptions, especially the [[Rabatak inscription]], and apparently never have ruled), and seemingly [[Vima Taktu]].

Kujula Kadphises was the great grandfather of Kanishka.

===Vima Taktu (80<U+2013>105)===
[[Image:Soter.JPG|thumb|Bronze coin of [[Vima Takto]]. Corrupted Greek legend <U+0392><U+0391><U+03A3><U+0399><U+039B><U+0395><U+03A5> <U+0392><U+0391><U+03A3><U+0399><U+039B><U+0395><U+03A5><U+03A9><U+039D> <U+03A3><U+03A9><U+03A4><U+0397><U+03A1> [<U+0393><U+0397><U+0395>.] "Basileu[s] Basileu<U+014D>n S<U+014D>t<U+0113>r [Megas?]": "The King of Kings, [Great?] Saviour".]]
[[Vima Takto|Vima Takt[u]]] (or Tak[to], Ancient Chinese: <U+960E><U+818F><U+73CD> ''Yangaozhen'' ) is not mentioned in the [[Rabatak inscription]] ([[Sadashkana]] is instead. See also the reference to Sims-William<U+2019>s article below). He was the predecessor of [[Vima Kadphises]], and [[Kanishka]] I. He expanded the Kushan Empire into the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. The ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' says:

:"His [Kujula Kadphises'] son, Yangaozhen (Vima Taktu), became king in his place. He conquered [[Tianzhu]] (Northwestern India) and installed a General to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang (Kushan) king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi."<ref>Hill, John E. 2004. ''The Western Regions according to the Hou Hanshu.'' Draft annotated English translation.[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hhshu/hou_han_shu.html]</ref>

===Vima Kadphises (105<U+2013>127)===
[[Image:WimaKadphisesCoinage.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Vima Kadphises]].]]
[[Vima Kadphises]] (Kushan language: <U+039F><U+03BF><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF> <U+039A><U+03B1><U+03B4><U+03C6><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03B7><U+03C2>) was a [[Kushan]] emperor from around 90<U+2013>100 CE, the son of [[Sadashkana]] and the grandson of [[Kujula Kadphises]], and the father of Kanishka I, as detailed by the [[Rabatak inscription]]. 

Vima Kadphises added to the Kushan territory by his conquests in [[Afghanistan]] and north-west [[India]]. He issued an extensive series of coins and inscriptions. He was the first to introduce gold coinage in India, in addition to the existing copper and silver coinage.

===Kanishka I (127<U+2013>147)===
[[Image:KanishkaCoinFacing.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Kanishka|Kanishka I]].]]

The rule of [[Kanishka]], fifth Kushan king, who flourished for at least 28 years from c.&nbsp;[[127]]. Upon his accession, Kanishka ruled a huge territory (virtually all of northern India), south to [[Ujjain]] and [[Kundina]] and east beyond [[Pataliputra]], according to the Rabatak inscription:
:"In the year one, it has been proclaimed unto India, unto the whole realm of the governing class, including Koonadeano (Kaundinya< [[Kundina]]) and the city of Ozeno (Ozene, [[Ujjain]]) and the city of Zageda ([[Saketa]]) and the city of Kozambo ([[Kausambi]]) and the city of Palabotro ([[Pataliputra]]) and so long unto (i.e. as far as) the city of Ziri-tambo ([[Janjgir-Champa|Sri-Champa]])." [[Rabatak inscription]], Lines 4<U+2013>6.

[[Image:Bathinda fort.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The [[Qila Mubarak]] fort at [[Bathinda]] was built by Kanishka.]]
His territory was administered from two capitals: Purushapura (now [[Peshawar]] in northern Pakistan) and [[Mathura]], in northern India. He is also credited (along with [[Raja Dab]]) for building the massive, ancient [[Fort at Bathinda]] ([[Qila Mubarak]]), in the modern city of [[Bathinda]], Indian [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].  

The Kushans also had a summer capital in [[Bagram]] (then known as Kapisa), where the "[[Bagram|Begram Treasure]]", comprising works of art from Greece to China, has been found. According to the [[Rabatak inscription]], Kanishka was the son of Vima Kadphises, the grandson of Sadashkana, and the great-grandson of Kujula Kadphises. Kanishka<U+2019>s era is now generally accepted to have begun in 127 on the basis of Harry Falk<U+2019>s ground-breaking research.<ref>Falk, Harry. 2001. "The yuga of Sphujiddhvaja and the era of the Ku<U+015F><U+00E2><U+0146>as." ''Silk Road Art and Archaeology VII'', pp. 121<U+2013>136.</ref><ref>Falk, Harry. 2004.

''Silk Road Art and Archaeology X'' , pp. 167<U+2013>176.</ref> Kanishka<U+2019>s era was used as a calendar reference by the Kushans for about a century, until the decline of the Kushan realm.

===V<U+0101>sishka===
[[V<U+0101>sishka]] was a [[Kushan]] emperor, who seems to have a short reign following [[Kanishka]]. His rule is recorded as far south as [[Sanchi]] (near [[Vidisa]]), where several inscriptions in his name have been found, dated to the year 22 (The Sanchi inscription of "Vaksushana" <U+2013> i.&nbsp;e. Vasishka Kushana) and year 28 (The Sanchi inscription of Vasaska <U+2013> i.&nbsp;e. Vasishka) of the Kanishka era.

[[Image:KushanCoinage2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Huvishka]].]]

===Huvishka (140<U+2013>183)===
[[Huvishka]] (Kushan: <U+039F><U+03BF><U+03B7><U+03F8><U+03BA><U+03B9>, "Ooishki") was a [[Kushan]] emperor from the death of [[Kanishka]] (assumed on the best evidence available to be in 140 CE) until the succession of [[Vasudeva I]] about forty years later. His rule was a period of retrenchment and consolidation for the Empire. In particular he devoted time and effort early in his reign to the exertion of greater control over the city of [[Mathura]].

===Vasudeva I (191<U+2013>225)===
[[Image:VasudevaCoin.jpg|thumb|Gold coin of [[Vasudeva I]].]]
[[Vasudeva I]] ([[Kushan]]: <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03B6><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03B7><U+03BF> "Bazodeo", [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: <U+6CE2><U+8ABF> "Bodiao") was the last of the "Great Kushans." Named inscriptions dating from year 64 to 98 of [[Kanishka]]<U+2019>s era suggest his reign extended from at least 191 to 225 CE. He was the last great Kushan emperor, and the end of his rule coincides with the invasion of the [[Sassanid]]s as far as northwestern India, and the establishment of the [[Indo-Sassanids]] or [[Kushanshahs]] from around 240 CE.

==Kushan deities==

The Kushan religious [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] is extremely varied, as revealed by their coins and their seals, on which more than 30 different gods appear, belonging to the Hellenistic, the Iranian, and to a lesser extent the Indian world. Greek deities, with Greek names are represented on early coins. During Kanishka's reign, the language of the coinage changes to Bactrian (though it remained in Greek script for all kings). After Huvishka, only two divinities appear on the coins: ''Ardoxsho'' and '' [[Oesho]] '' (see details below).

Representation of entities from Greek mythology and Hellenistic syncretism are:
* <U+0397><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> ([[Helios]]), <U+0397><U+03C6><U+03B1><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2> ([[Hephaistos]]), <U+03A3><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B7> ([[Selene]]), <U+0391><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2> ([[Anemos]]). Further, the coins of Huvishka also portray two demi-gods: ''erakilo'' [[Heracles]], and ''sarapo'' [[Sarapis]].

The Indic entities represented on coinage include:

* Two copper coins of Huvishka bear a 'Ganesa' legend, but instead of depicting the typical [[theriomorphic]] figure of [[Ganesha]], have a figure of an archer holding a full-length bow with string inwards and an arrow. This is typically a depiction of [[Rudra]], but in the case of these two coins is generally assumed to represent [[Shiva]].

==The Kushans and Buddhism==
[[Image:BuddhistTriad.JPG|thumb|250px|An early Mahayana Buddhist triad. From left to right, a [[Kushan]] devotee, the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]], the Buddha, the Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]], and a Buddhist monk. 2nd-3rd century, [[Gandhara]].]]

Cultural exchanges also flourished, encouraging the development of [[Greco-Buddhism]], a fusion of [[Hellenistic]] and [[Buddhist]] cultural elements, that was to expand into central and northern Asia as [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. 

Kanishka is renowned in Buddhist tradition for having convened a [[Buddhist Councils#The fourth Buddhist council|great Buddhist council]] in [[Kashmir]].  Kanishka also had the original [[Gandhari]] vernacular, or [[Prakrit]], Buddhist texts translated into the language of [[Sanskrit]]. Along with the Indian emperors [[Ashoka]] and [[Harsha|Harsha Vardhana]] and the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander I]] (Milinda), Kanishka is considered by Buddhism as one of its greatest benefactors.

===Kushan art===
The art and culture of [[Gandhara]], at the crossroads of the Kushan hegemony, are the best known expressions of Kushan influences to Westerners. Several direct depictions of Kushans are known from Gandhara, where they are represented with a tunic, belt and trousers and play the role of devotees to the Buddha, as well as the [[Bodhisattva]] and future Buddha [[Maitreya]]. 

In the iconography, they are never associated however with the very Hellenistic "Standing Buddha" statues ([[Greco-Buddhist art#The Buddha|See image]]), which might therefore correspond to an earlier historical period. The style of these friezes incorporating Kushan devotees is already strongly Indianized, quite remote from earlier Hellenistic depictions of the Buddha:

==Contacts with Rome==
[[Image:BegramGladiator.JPG|thumb|180px|A Greco-Roman gladiator on a glass vessel, [[Begram]], 2nd century.]]
Several Roman sources describe the visit of ambassadors from the Kings of Bactria and India during the [[2nd century]], probably referring to the Kushans.

[[Historia Augusta]], speaking of [[Hadrian|Emperor Hadrian]] ([[117]]&ndash;[[138]]) tells:
 
:"''Reges Bactrianorum legatos ad eum, amicitiae petendae causa, supplices miserunt''"
:"The kings of the Bactrians sent supplicant ambassadors to him, to seek his friendship."

[[Image:TrajanCoinAhinposhBuddhistMonasteryAfghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A coin of the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]], found together with coins of Kanishka, at the [[Ahin Posh]] Buddhist Monastery, Afghanistan.]]
Also in [[138]], according to [[Aurelius Victor]] (''Epitome''<U+201A> XV, 4), and [[Appian]] (''Praef.'', 7), [[Antoninus Pius]], successor to [[Hadrian]], received some Indian, Bactrian (Kushan) and Hyrcanian ambassadors.

The Chinese Historical Chronicle of the [[Hou Hanshu]] also describes the exchange of goods between northwestern India and the [[Roman Empire]] at that time: "To the west (Tiazhu, northwestern India) communicates with [[Da Qin]] (the Roman Empire). Precious things from Da Qin can be found there, as well as fine cotton cloths, excellent wool carpets, perfumes of all sorts, sugar loaves, pepper, ginger, and black salt."

The summer capital of the Kushan in [[Begram]] has yielded a considerable amount of goods imported from the Roman Empire, in particular various types of glassware.

==Contacts with China==
[[Image:Lokaksema.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Kushan Buddhist monk [[Lokaksema]], first known translator of Buddhist [[Mahayana]] scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], circa 170.]]
During the 1st and 2nd century, the Kushan Empire expanded militarily to the north and occupied parts of the [[Tarim Basin]], their original grounds, putting them at the center of the profitable Central Asian commerce with the [[Roman Empire]]. They are related to have collaborated militarily with the Chinese against nomadic incursion, particularly when they collaborated with the Chinese general [[Ban Chao]] against the Sogdians in [[84]], when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of [[Kashgar]]. Around [[85]], they also assisted the Chinese general in an attack on [[Turfan]], east of the Tarim Basin. 

In recognition for their support to the Chinese, the Kushans requested, but were denied, a [[Han Dynasty|Han]] princess, even after they had sent presents to the Chinese court.  In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in [[86]] with a force of 70,000, but, exhausted by the expedition, were finally defeated by the smaller Chinese force.  The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire during the reign of the Chinese emperor [[Emperor He of Han China|Han He]] ([[89]]&ndash;[[106]]).

[[Image:KanishkaICoinFoundInKhotan.jpg|thumb|200px|A bronze coin of [[Kanishka]] found in [[Khotan]], [[Tarim Basin]].]]
Later, around [[116]], the Kushans under [[Kanishka]] established a kingdom centered on [[Kashgar]], also taking control of [[Hotan|Khotan]] and [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]], which were Chinese dependencies in the [[Tarim Basin]], modern [[Xinjiang]]. They introduced the [[Br<U+0101>hm<U+012B> script|Brahmi]] script, the Indian [[Prakrit]] language for administration, and expanded the influence of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] which developed into [[Serindian art]].

The Kushans are again recorded to have sent presents to the Chinese court in [[158]]&ndash;[[159]] during the reign of the Chinese emperor [[Emperor Huan of Han China|Han Huan]]. 

Following these interactions, cultural exhanges further increased, and Kushan Buddhist missionaries, such as [[Lokaksema]], became active in the Chinese capital cities of [[Loyang]] and sometimes [[Nanjing]], where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They were the first recorded promoters of Hinayana and Mahayana scriptures in China, greatly contributing to the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]].

==Decline==
[[Image:KanishkaII.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Gold dinar of Kushan king [[Kanishka II]] ([[200]]&ndash;[[220]])]]
[[Image:KushanCoinage.jpg|thumb|150px|Late Kushan ruler [[Shaka I]] (325-345).]]
After the death of [[Vasudeva I]] in [[225]], the Kushan empire split into western and eastern halves. The Western Kushans (in Afghanistan) were soon subjugated by the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] and lost [[Bactria]] and other territories. In [[248]] they were defeated again by the Persians, who deposed the Western dynasty and replaced them with Persian vassals known as the [[Kushanshas]] (or Indo-Sassanids).

The Eastern Kushan kingdom was based in the Punjab. Around [[270]] their territories on the Gangetic plain became independent under local dynasties such as the [[Yaudheyas]]. Then in the mid 4th century they were subjugated by the [[Gupta Empire]] under [[Samudragupta]].

In [[360]] a Kushan vassal named [[Kidara]] overthrew the old Kushan dynasty and established the [[Kidarite Kingdom]]. The Kushan style of Kidarite coins indicates they considered themselves as Kushans. The Kidarite seem to have been rather prosperous, although on a smaller scale than their Kushan predecessors.

These remnants of the Kushan empire were ultimately wiped out in the [[5th century]] by the invasions of the [[White Huns]], and later the expansion of [[Islam]].

==In fiction==
The Kushan Empire was used to represent a [[dystopian]] demonic empire within the hugely popular ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'' [[manga]]. Its culture is based on that of ancient and medieval [[India]], which was the cultural centre of the real Kushan Empire, including Indian weapons such as [[chakram]]s, [[katar]]s and [[urumi]]s, and martial arts similar to [[Kalarippayattu]], but adapted for the [[nihilistic]] setting.  In this fictional setting it is ruled by the Emperor [[Characters in Berserk#Other characters|Ganishka]], a name based upon the real Kushan Emperor [[Kanishka]].
