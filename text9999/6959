The '''April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak''' was a major [[tornado outbreak]] in the [[Central United States|Central]] and parts of the [[Southern United States]] that began on April 6, 2006 in the [[Great Plains]] and continued until April 8 in [[South Carolina]], with most of the activity on April 7. The hardest-hit area was [[Middle Tennessee]] where several strong tornadoes devastated entire neighborhoods and left nine people dead. The worst damage took place in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]. Other communities north of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] were also hard hit. 

There were 73 tornadoes confirmed across 13 states, with the bulk of them coming on the afternoon and evening of April 7 across the South, particularly in [[Tennessee]]. In total, 13 deaths were reported as a result of the severe weather (12 of them in Tennessee) and over $1.5&nbsp;billion in damage was reported,<ref name="billiondollar"/> of which over $630&nbsp;million was in Middle Tennessee.<ref name="linger">{{cite news| url=http://www.gallatinnewsexaminer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061007/COUNTY08/610070334 |title=Storms' losses linger |publisher=Gallatin News-Examiner |date=2006-10-07 |accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> It was the third major outbreak of 2006, hot on the heels of [[April 2, 2006 Tornado Outbreak|a major outbreak]] on April 2. It was also considered to be the worst disaster event in Middle Tennessee since the [[1998 Nashville tornado outbreak|Nashville tornado outbreak]] on April 16, 1998.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[Image:SPC severe outlook 04072006.png|thumb|left|[[probability|Probabilistic]] maps issued by the [[Storm Prediction Center]] during the heart of the outbreak.]]The outbreak took place as a result of a powerful [[Low pressure area|low pressure system]] over the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] that produced a strong [[cold front]] which tracked eastward across the South.  The dry, cold air behind the cold front combined with warm, humid air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to allow severe thunderstorms to form, particularly on April 7.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Konop  | first = Elizabeth  | title = April 7, 2006 Tornado Outbreak across the Tennessee Valley  | publisher = [[University of Wisconsin]]  | date = May 10, 2006  | url = http://www.aos.wisc.edu/uwaosjournal/Volume1/AOS453/FCS_Konop.pdf  | format = pdf  | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref>

The [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a high risk for severe weather for both April 6 and April 7 in the areas likely to be affected. Conditions were favorable for an extremely strong tornado outbreak on both days.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Apr 6, 2006 1630 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook   | publisher = [[Storm Prediction Center]]  | date = April 6, 2006  | url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2006/day1otlk_20060406_1630.html  | accessdate = 2008-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Activity was not as great as expected on April 6, with only 12 tornadoes confirmed, mostly in [[Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = April 6, 2006 tornadoes  | publisher = Tornado History Project  | url = http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?p=1&s=4&d=asc&yr=2006&mo=4&day=6&st=%&fu=%&co=Any&l=500&format=basic&submit=Table&dcom=&dpho=&dvid=&ddat=on&dtim=&dsta=on&dfuj=on&dfat=on&dinj=on&dwid=&dlen=&dcou=on&dong=&dare=&dfar=&drot=&ddam=&dpl=&dpw=&dtyp=&drem=&dtlat=&dtlon=&dllat=&dllon=&dstt=&dtor=  | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> Several of the tornadoes were damaging, but no fatalities and only a few injuries were reported. The reason for the relatively modest activity was due to the more stable than expected air mass that day over the region, with lower [[dewpoint]]s and less [[wind shear]] despite the absence of a cap which would have otherwise allowed a massive outbreak.<ref name="HighRisk">{{cite web| url=http://sphs.angeltowns.net/A_R_Wehrle/recenthighrisk2.html|title=SPC High Risk Forecasts May 24, 2004-Present |publisher=Stoughton Piston Head Society |date=2006-04-07|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref>

|}Conditions changed on April 7 in the South as the system moved eastward, with the cold front entering a more conducive environment. The increased [[wind shear]], combined with the high heat and [[humidity]], allowed tornadoes to begin forming in the late morning, continuing throughout the afternoon, evening, and even into the overnight hours. By the end of the day, a total of 48 tornadoes had been reported, several of which caused significant damage and loss of life. The most violent tornadoes hit in [[Middle Tennessee]], where 12 people were killed.<ref name="WHNT">{{cite news| url=http://www.whnt.com/Global/story.asp?S=4742873 |title=11 People Killed by Storms in Tennessee |publisher=WHNT-TV |date=2006-04-07 |accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref> In addition to the tornadoes, there were many reports of [[hail]] as large as [[softball]]s, powerful [[microburst]]s and straight-line winds, as well as local [[Flash flood|flood]]ing. Extensive damage was also reported in the northern suburbs of [[Atlanta, Georgia]] as the storms reached that area overnight into the early morning of April 8.

Despite a lower risk of activity on April 8, the severe weather continued in [[Alabama]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (mostly in the early morning hours) with another 13 tornadoes reported before the outbreak finally ended as the system moved offshore into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Over the three day period, 73 tornadoes were confirmed.

===North Nashville area supercell===
[[Image:Gallatintornado2.jpg|thumb|right|Residential damage in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]. This tornado would kill nine people in the surrounding neighborhoods, though only minor injuries were reported at the college.]] 
The most destructive supercell of the outbreak developed just northwest of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] at about 1:30 pm CDT (1830 UTC) on April 7 in [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]].  It would then track across the northern suburbs of Nashville through [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham]], [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson]], and [[Sumner County, Tennessee|Sumner]] counties, killing nine people and damaging or destroying an estimated 1,000 homes.<ref>{{cite news| first=Blake |last= Farmer| url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section_id=9&screen=news&news_id=55543 |title=The cleanup continues 12 months after deadly twister|publisher=Nashville City Paper |date=2007-04-06|accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>

The first tornado touched down near [[Charlotte, Tennessee|Charlotte]] at 1:30 pm CDT (1830 UTC). That tornado was a rated as a strong '''F3'''. Severe and extensive damage was reported in that area as well as in [[Greenbrier, Tennessee|Greenbrier]]. At least 12 houses, including several mobile homes, were destroyed. In addition at least 50 other houses were damaged, most of which sustained heavy damage. The tornado tracked towards [[Ashland City, Tennessee|Ashland City]] inflicting more significant damage, including numerous houses and businesses. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down. The worst impact was felt at Centennial Medical Center's Ashland City [[hospital]] site, which was damaged and lost its [[heating]] and [[air conditioning]] system, forcing several patients to be transferred to Nashville hospitals. No injuries were reported there.<ref name="ashlandcity">{{cite news| url=http://www.ashlandcitytimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060407/MTCN0101/60407025/1292/MTCN01 |title=Strong storms hit Ashland City|publisher=Ashland City Times |date=2006-04-07|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>

[[Image:Gallatintornado4.jpg|thumb|left|Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee]]The supercell then tracked into Davidson County and the northernmost part of Nashville. It was initially reported that new tornado touched down at about 2:00 p.m. CDT (1900 UTC) in [[Whites Creek]], a largely rural area with light-scale development along [[U.S. Route 431|US 431]] near Old Hickory Boulevard. Damage was reported along a path stretching out to [[Interstate 24|I-24]] near Exit 40. The [[Tennessee Emergency Management Agency]] reported that 15 houses and 10 other buildings were destroyed in the area, about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} north of the urban part of Nashville.<ref name="davidson">{{cite news| url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060408/NEWS01/604080350|title=Davidson County: 15 homes and 10 other buildings destroyed |publisher=Nashville Tennessean |date=2006-04-08|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref><ref name="complex">{{cite news| url=http://www.rctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060410/MTCN0401/304100019/1310/MTCN0301 |title=Storm thrashes athletic complex|publisher=Gallatin News-Examiner |date=2006-04-16|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref> However, that tornado was never confirmed; it was likely straight-line wind damage.

The supercell then tracked into [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee|Goodlettsville]] where another tornado touched down, striking the suburban area at around 2:15 pm CDT (1915 UTC) with considerable force. It hit a residential subdivision in the center of town, with considerable damage reported at [[City Hall]], Two local [[churches]](Bakers Chapel [[CME Church]] and Metro Baptist Church), and to numerous houses, some of which were demolished. In total, 25 homes were destroyed in Goodlettsville and another 44 homes or businesses were damaged. The tornado then heavily damaged a busy commercial area along [[Tennessee State Highway 174|Long Hollow Pike]], blowing the roofs off of several buildings and heavily damaging others. It also caused severe damage to the [[electricity]] network in the area, which was out for several days in some subdivisions in [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee|Goodlettsville]].<ref name="rubble">{{cite news| url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060408/NEWS01/604080348|title=Goodlettsville: Intact day-care a miracle amid surrounding rubble|publisher=Nashville Tennessean |date=2006-04-08|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref> The tornado also caused a traffic nightmare as a direct result of tornado-related accidents on [[Interstate 65|I-65]] at Exit 97 just before [[rush hour]].<ref name="traffic">{{cite news| url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060408/NEWS01/604080352|title=Storms shut down roads, leaving traffic at a standstill |publisher=Nashville Tennessean |date=2006-04-08|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref> No deaths were reported in [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee|Goodlettsville]] although seven injuries were reported, and public shelters were set up at two locations.

[[Image:Gallatintornado5.jpg|right|thumb|Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee]]The tornado continued into [[Sumner County, Tennessee|Sumner County]] just north of [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]]. It damaged numerous houses in that area before entering and devastating [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]] with '''F3''' damage at about 2:30 pm CDT (1930 UTC). Several entire subdivisions, primarily along the north shore of [[Old Hickory Lake]], were destroyed or flattened, killing nine people and injuring 121.<ref name="midstate">{{cite news| url=http://www.dicksonherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060409/NEWS01/604090395|title=Midstate counts loss, struggles to move forward|publisher=Dickson Herald |date=2006-04-09|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref> Three of the deaths were on the southwest end of Gallatin near Old Hickory Lake, and the other six were in the area of [[Tennessee State Highway 109|South Water Avenue]]. Over 700 houses were damaged or destroyed, including about 80 in Hendersonville. The Woodhaven subdivision of Gallatin was later discovered to have been poorly constructed (considering the value of the homes), with boards nailed to the [[cinder block]]s at the base of the foundation.

[[Volunteer State Community College]] suffered extensive damage to numerous buildings, briefly trapping many students before they were rescued with only a few minor injuries. The front lawn of the college was littered with debris from buildings after the tornado. The public relations director for the college, Angie Jowers, stated that having routine tornado drills paid off that day, as no one was killed on the campus. A commercial area was also hit hard, along with three large [[car dealership]]s near Vol State, which saw hundreds of cars destroyed.<ref name="sumner">{{cite news| url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060408/NEWS01/604080351|title=Sumner County: 'worst thing I've seen in my life'|publisher=Nashville Tennessean |date=2006-04-08|accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref> Damage to the campus was estimated at $56&nbsp;million.<ref name="Goodlettsville">{{cite web| url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~630418 |title=Event Record Details (Goodlettsville) |publisher=NOAA |date=2006-11-11 |accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>[[Image:Gallatintornado6.jpg|left|thumb|Damage to a storefront in Gallatin, Tennessee]]

[[Station Camp High School]], a local high school, also received notable damage from this storm.  The tornado affected its large athletic complex, tearing parts of the roof off and flooding the gymnasium. Damage was also sustained to student and faculty vehicles.<ref name="complex"/><ref name="drills">{{cite news| url=http://www.gallatinnewsexaminer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060410/MTCN0401/304100023/1310/MTCN04 |title=Tornado drills prepare students for the worst|publisher=Gallatin News-Examiner |date=2006-04-10|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>  The tornado lifted shortly thereafter, however the supercell continued eastward and [[tornado warning]]s were issues east of Gallatin as well.  Total damage from the supercell tornadoes was estimated at over $650&nbsp;million.<ref name="linger"/>

Coincidentally, the outbreak also cut short the first of a two-day emergency preparedness drill to be held on April 7 and 8 in four Middle Tennessee counties: [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson]], [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson]], [[Sumner County, Tennessee|Sumner]], and [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson]]. The second day was canceled.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Emery  | first = Theo  | title = 11 More Killed in Tennessee as Tornadoes Strike Again  | publisher = [[New York Times]]  | date = April 8, 2006  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/08/us/08tornadoes.html  | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref><!-- (unsourced) It was to be the nation's largest local disaster drill since [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck in late August 2005.

There was also major damage to a large barn, and shingles were pulled from a roof. This tornado continued along a path due east where it crossed the intersection of [[Tennessee State Route 56|TN-56]] and [[Tennessee State Route 287|TN-287]], causing additional damage along this path. Two mobile homes on Foster Road were completely destroyed, and two fatalities occurred.<ref name=tproject /> The width of the tornado was {{convert|150|yd|m}}, and the path length was {{convert|11|mi|km}}.<ref name=warren1 />

The second tornado in Warren County, also an '''F1''', occurred near the small town of [[Morrison, Tennessee]], about {{convert|9|mi|km}} southwest of the county seat of [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]].<ref name=warren2>{{cite web  | title = Event Record Details - Warren County  | publisher = National Climatic Data Center  | date = April 7, 2006  | url = http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~634909  | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref> It touched down along Caney Branch Road where there was extensive damage to a barn and a cinder block building, and numerous large trees were downed. The third and last fatality in Warren County occurred in a trailer home on Bonner Road.<ref name=warren2/> The tornado continued slightly south of east in the County Club subdivision, where several homes sustained roof damage and outbuildings were destroyed. The width of this tornado was {{convert|100|yd|m}}, with a path length of {{convert|4|mi|km}}.<ref name=warren2 />

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Gallatintornado3.jpg|right|thumb|Residential damage in Gallatin, Tennessee]]On the night after the tornado hit Gallatin, there were many reports of [[looting]] in the devastated community. A nightly [[curfew]] was required to combat the looting and maintain order in the community. There were a total of 23 arrests made. The [[United States National Guard]] was called in after the tornado hit to help with security and the removal of the excessive debris. It would take 10&nbsp;days for Volunteer State Community College to re-open after the tornado hit.

The City of Hendersonville did not have [[tornado siren]]s at the time of the tornado, but the city installed some soon after the storm.<ref name="Goodlettsville"/>

On September 26, the [[Greater Nashville Regional Council]] awarded the authorities involved in the recovery (including the municipalities of Sumner County) the Marshall S. Stuart Memorial Award for outstanding intergovernmental cooperation after the tornado. The quick response by other local authorities, counties and cities was congratulated.<ref name="linger"/>

In early October 2006, an episode of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' featured a family from Hendersonville that had their home being rebuilt after it was destroyed by the tornado.<ref name="remembers">{{cite news| url=http://www.wkrn.com/nashville/news/midstate-remembers-deadly-tornadoes-mos-later |title=Mid-State Remembers Deadly Tornadoes, 6 Mos.

Nonetheless, many homes have been rebuilt in the area.<ref name="linger"/>
