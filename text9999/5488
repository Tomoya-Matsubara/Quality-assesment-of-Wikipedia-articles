[[Image:Felice Beato.jpg|thumb|Felice Beato, self-portrait, c. 1866.]]

'''Felice Beato''' (born 1833 or 1834, died 1907), sometimes known as '''Felix Beato''', was a [[Corfu|Corfiote]] [[photographer]]<ref>Beato has long been described as [[British Empire|British]] and [[Italian people|Italian]]. He was a British subject, born in Corfu, of Italian heritage.</ref>. He was one of the first photographers to take pictures in [[East Asia]] and one of the first [[war photography|war photographers]]. He is also noted for his [[genre work]]s, [[portrait]]s, and views and [[panoramic photography|panoramas]] of the architecture and landscapes of [[Asia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. Beato's travels to many lands gave him the opportunity to create powerful and lasting images of countries, people and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. To this day his work provides the key images of such events as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and the [[Second Opium War]]. His photographs represent the first substantial oeuvre of what came to be called [[photojournalism]]. He had a significant impact on other photographers, and Beato's influence in [[Japan]], where he worked with and taught numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.

== Origins and identity ==
The origins and identity of Felice Beato have been problematic issues, but the confusion over his birth date and birthplace seems now to have been substantially cleared up. Based on an application for a travel permit that he made in 1858, Beato was born in 1833 or 1834 on the island of [[Corfu]]<ref>Dobson, "'I been to keep up my position'", 31. Some past sources have given his birth date as 1825 or ca. 1825, but these dates may have been confused references to the possible birth date of his brother, Antonio. As an aside, Dobson notes the interesting coincidence that two of the most important 19th century interpreters of Japan &ndash; Beato in photography and [[Lafcadio Hearn]] in literature &ndash; were born within 100 miles of each other.</ref>. At the time of his birth, Corfu was part of the British [[protectorate]] of the [[Ionian Islands]], and so Beato would have qualified as a [[British subject]]<ref>Dobson, "'I been to keep up my position'", 31.</ref>. Corfu had previously been a [[Venice|Venetian]] possession, and this fact goes some way to explaining the many references to Beato as "Italian" and "Venetian"<ref>Corfu was on and off part of Venetian territory until 1815, when the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] placed it and the other Ionian Islands under British "protection". Corfu was finally ceded to [[Greece]] in 1864.</ref>.

Because of the existence of a number of photographs signed "Felice Antonio Beato" and "Felice A. Beato", it was long assumed that there was one photographer who somehow managed to photograph at the same time in places as distant as [[Egypt]] and [[Japan]]. But in 1983 it was shown by Italo Zannier <ref>Bennett 1996, 38.</ref> that "[[Felice A. Beato|Felice Antonio Beato]]" represented two brothers, Felice Beato and [[Antonio Beato]], who sometimes worked together, sharing a signature. The confusion arising from the signatures continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was the creator of a given image.

== Mediterranean, the Crimea and India ==
Little is certain about Felice Beato's early development as a photographer, though it is said that he bought his first and only lens in [[Paris]] in 1851<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, 90.</ref>. He probably met British photographer [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]] in [[Malta]] in 1850 and accompanied him to [[Constantinople]] in 1851. Robertson had been an [[engraving|engraver]] at the [[Imperial Ottoman Mint]] since 1843 and had probably taken up photography in the 1840s<ref>Broecker, 58; Clark, Fraser, and Osman, 89, 90.</ref>. In 1853 the two began photographing together and they formed a [[partnership]] called "Robertson & Beato" either in that year or in 1854 when Robertson opened a [[photographic studio]] in [[Beyo<U+011F>lu|Pera]], Constantinople. Robertson and Beato were joined by Beato's brother Antonio on photographic expeditions to Malta in 1854 or 1856 and to Greece and [[Jerusalem]] in 1857. A number of the firm's photographs produced in the 1850s are signed "Robertson, Beato and Co." and it is believed that the "and Co." refers to Antonio<ref>Oztuncay, 24; Clark, Fraser, and Osman, 90-91.</ref>.

[[Image:Secundra Bagh after Indian Mutiny.jpg|thumb|300px|Interior of the Secundra Bagh after the slaughter of 2,000 rebels by the 93rd Highlanders and 4th Punjab Regt.]]

In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married the Beato brothers' sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859) and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861)<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, 90.</ref>.

In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to [[Balaklava]], [[Crimea]] where they took over reportage of the [[Crimean War]] following [[Roger Fenton]]'s departure. They photographed the fall of [[Sevastopol|Sebastopol]] in September 1855, producing about 60 images<ref>Auer and Auer; Broecker, 58.</ref>.

In February 1858 Felice Beato arrived in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and began travelling throughout [[Indo-Gangetic plain|Northern India]] to document the aftermath of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion of 1857]]<ref>Harris, 23; Dehejia, 121; Auer and Auer; Masselos 2000, 1. Gernsheim states that Beato and Robertson ''both'' travelled to India in 1857, but it is now generally accepted that Beato travelled there alone. (Gernsheim, 96).</ref>. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses<ref>Turner, 447.</ref>. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of [[Sikandra Bagh|Secundra Bagh]] in [[Lucknow]] he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see [[#Taku_Forts|events at Taku Forts]]). He was also in the cities of [[Delhi]], [[Kanpur|Cawnpore]], [[Meerut]], [[Varanasi|Benares]], [[Amritsar]], [[Agra]], [[Shimla|Simla]] and [[Lahore]]<ref>Harris, 23; Clark, Fraser, and Osman, 91-92.</ref>. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left [[India]], probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in 1862<ref>Clark, Fraser, and Osman, 90, 91.</ref>.

== China ==
In 1860 Felice Beato left the partnership of "Robertson & Beato", though Robertson retained use of the name until 1867. Beato was sent from India to photograph the Anglo-French military expedition to [[China]] in the [[Second Opium War]]. He arrived in [[Hong Kong]] in March and immediately began photographing the city and its surroundings as far as [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Beato's photographs are some of the earliest taken in China.

While in Hong Kong, Beato met [[Charles Wirgman]], an artist and correspondent for the ''[[Illustrated London News]].'' The two accompanied the Anglo-French forces travelling north to [[Dalian Bay|Talien Bay]], then to [[Beitang|Pehtang]] and the Taku Forts at the mouth of the [[Hai He|Peiho]], and on to [[Beijing|Peking]] and the suburban Summer Palace, Qingyi Yuan. Wirgman's (and others') illustrations for the ''Illustrated London News'' are often derived from Beato's photographs of the places on this route.

===Taku Forts===
[[Image:Upper North Taku Fort.jpg|thumb|300px|Interior of Angle of North Fort Immediately after Its Capture, 21st August, 1860]]

Beato's photographs of the Second Opium War are the first to document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His photographs of the [[Taku Forts]] represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a [[narrative]] recreation of a battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. Interestingly, the photographs were not taken in this order as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts. In albums of the time these photographs are placed in such a way as to recreate the sequence of the battle <ref>Harris 1999.</ref>.

Beato's images of the Chinese dead <U+2014> he never photographed British or [[France|French]] dead <U+2014> and his manner of producing them particularly reveal the [[ideology|ideological]] aspects of his [[photojournalism]]. Dr. David F. Rennie, a member of the expedition, noted in his campaign memoir, <U+201C>I walked round the ramparts on the West side. They were thickly strewn with dead <U+2014> in the North-West angle thirteen were lying in one group around a gun. Signor Beato was there in great excitement, characterising the group as <U+2018>beautiful<U+2019> and begging that it might not be interfered with until perpetuated by his photographic apparatus, which was done a few minutes afterwards<U+2026><U+201D> <ref>Quoted in Griffiths.</ref>. The resultant photographs are a powerful representation of military triumph and British [[imperialism|imperialist]] power, not least for the purchasers of his images: British soldiers, colonial administrators, merchants and tourists. Back in Britain Beato's images were used to justify the Opium (and other colonial) Wars and they shaped public awareness of the cultures that existed in the [[Eastern world|East]].

===Summer Palace===
[[Image:Belvedere_of_the_God_of_Literature,_Summer_Palace.jpg|thumb|300px|Belvedere of the God of Literature, Summer Palace, before its destruction]]

Just outside Peking, Beato took photographs at the [[Summer Palace]], Qingyi Yuan (Garden of Clear Ripples), a private estate of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] comprising palace pavilions, temples, a large artificial lake and gardens. Some of these photographs, taken between 6 and 18 October 1860, are haunting, unique images of buildings that were plundered and looted by the Anglo-French forces beginning on the 6 October, and then, on the 18 and 19 October, set to the torch by the British First Division on the orders of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] as a reprisal against the emperor for the torture and deaths of twenty members of an Allied diplomatic party. Among the last photographs that Beato took in China at this time were portraits of Lord Elgin, arrived in Peking to sign the [[Convention of Peking]], and [[Yixin, Prince Gong|Prince Kung]], who signed on behalf of the [[Xianfeng Emperor]].

Beato had returned to [[England]] by November 1861, and during that winter he sold four hundred of his photographs of India and China to [[Henry Hering]], a [[London]] commercial portrait photographer. Hering had them duplicated and then resold them. When they first went on sale single views were offered at 7 shillings, while the complete India series was priced at <U+00A3>54 8s and the complete China series at <U+00A3>37 8s. Knowing that by 1867 the average per capita income in England and Wales had ''climbed'' to <U+00A3>32 per year puts the price of Beato's photographs into perspective.

==Japan==
By 1863 Beato had moved to [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]], joining Charles Wirgman who had been there since 1861. The two formed and maintained a partnership called <U+201C>Beato & Wirgman, Artists and Photographers<U+201D> during the years 1864<U+2013>1867. Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato's photographs while Beato photographed some of Wirgman's sketches and other works. Beato's Japanese photographs include portraits, genre works, landscapes, cityscapes and a series of photographs documenting the scenery and sites along the [[Tokaido]], the latter series recalling the [[ukiyo-e]] of [[Hiroshige]] and [[Hokusai]]. This was a significant time to be photographing in Japan since foreign access to (and within) the country was greatly restricted by the [[Shogun|Shogunate]]. Beato's images are remarkable not only for their quality, but for their rarity as photographic views of [[Edo period]] Japan.

[[Image:Satsuma-samurai-during-boshin-war-period.jpg|thumb|300px|Samurai of the Satsuma clan, during the [[Boshin War]] period (1868-1869)]]

Beato was very active while in Japan. In September 1864 he was an official photographer on the military expedition to [[Bombardment of Shimonoseki|Shimonoseki]]. The following year he produced a number of dated views of [[Nagasaki]] and its surroundings. From 1866 he was often (gently) [[Caricature|caricatured]] in ''[[Japan Punch]],'' which was founded and edited by Wirgman. In an October 1866 fire that destroyed much of Yokohama, Beato lost his studio and negatives and he spent the next two years working vigorously to produce replacement material. The result was two volumes of photographs, <U+2018>Native Types<U+2019>, containing 100 portraits and genre works, and <U+2018>Views of Japan<U+2019>, containing 98 landscapes and cityscapes. Many of the photographs were [[hand-colouring|hand-coloured]], a technique that in Beato's studio successfully applied the refined skills of [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[watercolor painting|watercolourists]] and [[woodblock printing|woodblock printmakers]] to European photography. From 1869 to 1877 Beato, no longer partnered with Wirgman, ran his own studio in Yokohama called <U+201C>F. Beato & Co., Photographers<U+201D> with an assistant named H. Woolett and four Japanese photographers and four Japanese [[artists]]. [[Kusakabe Kimbei]] was probably one of Beato's artist-assistants before becoming a photographer in his own right. Beato photographed with [[Ueno Hikoma]] and others, and possibly taught photography to [[Baron Raimund von Stillfried|Raimund von Stillfried]].

[[Image:Samurai.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese samurai in armour, 1860s.]]

In 1871 Beato served as official photographer with the [[United States naval expedition to Korea of 1871|United States naval expedition]] of [[Christopher Raymond Perry Rodgers|Admiral Rodgers]] to [[Korea]]. The views Beato took on this expedition are the earliest confirmed photographs of the country and its inhabitants.

While in Japan, Beato did not confine his activities to photography, but also engaged in a number of business ventures. He owned land and several studios, was a property consultant, had a financial interest in the Grand Hotel of Yokohama and was a dealer in imported carpets and women's bags, among other things. He also appeared in [[court]] on several occasions, variously as [[plaintiff]], [[defendant]] and [[witness]]. On 6 August 1873 Beato was appointed [[Consulate general|Consul General]] for Greece in Japan, a fact that possibly supports the case for his origins being in Corfu.

In 1877, Beato sold most of his stock to the firm, [[Stillfried & Andersen]], who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to [[Adolfo Farsari]] in 1885. Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen, Beato apparently retired for some years from photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial [[speculation|speculator]] and trader. On 29 November 1884 Beato left Japan, ultimately landing in [[Port Said]], Egypt. It was reported in a Japanese newspaper that he had lost all his money on the Yokohama [[silver]] exchange.

==Later years==
[[Image:Hman_Kyaung_Mandalay.jpg|thumb|300px|Queen's Silver Pagoda, [[Mandalay]], c. 1889]]
From 1884 to 1885 Beato was the official photographer of the expeditionary forces led by Baron (later Viscount) [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|G.J. Wolseley]] to [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]] in relief of [[Charles George Gordon|General Charles Gordon]]. None of the photographs Beato took in Sudan are known to have survived.

Briefly back in England, in 1886 Beato lectured the [[London and Provincial Photographic Society]] on photographic techniques. But by 1888 he was photographing in Asia again, this time in [[Myanmar|Burma]], where from 1896 he operated a photographic studio (called <U+2018>The Photographic Studio<U+2019>) as well as a furniture and curio business in [[Mandalay]], with a branch office in [[Yangon|Rangoon]]. Examples of his mail order catalogue <U+2014> affixed with Beato's own photographs of the merchandise on offer <U+2014> are in the possession of at least two photographic collections. Knowledge of his last years is as sketchy as that of his early years; Beato may or may not have been working after 1899, but in January 1907 his company, F. Beato Ltd., went into liquidation and it is presumed that he died shortly thereafter.

==Beato and photography==
Photographs of the 19th century often now shows the limitations of the technology used, yet Felice Beato managed to successfully work within and even transcend those limitations. He predominantly produced [[albumen print|albumen silver prints]] from [[collodion process|wet collodion]] glass-plate [[negative (photography)|negatives]]. Beyond aesthetic considerations, the long exposure times needed by this process must have been a further stimulus to Beato to frame and position the subjects of his photographs carefully. Apart from his portrait-making, he often posed local people in such a way as to set off the architectural or topographical subjects of his images, but otherwise people (and other moving objects) are sometimes rendered a blur or disappear altogether during the long exposures. Such blurs are a common feature of 19th century photographs.

Like other 19th century [[commercial photography|commercial photographers]], Beato often made [[copy print]]s of his original photographs. The original would have been pinned to a stationary surface and then photographed, producing a second negative from which to make more [[photographic printing|prints]]. The pins used to hold the original in place are sometimes visible in copy prints. In spite of the limitations of this method, including the loss of detail and degradation of other picture elements, it was an effective and economical way to duplicate images.

Beato pioneered and refined the techniques of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring photographs at the suggestion of Wirgman or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners [[Charles Parker (photographer)|Charles Parker]] and [[William Parke Andrew]]<ref>Bennett 1996, 39.</ref>. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, though more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are also excellent<ref>Bennett quotes and summarises collector Henry Rosin's appraisal of Beato's hand-coloured photographs. Bennett 1996, 43; Robinson, 48.</ref>. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular [[panorama]]s, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of [[Beitang|Pehtang]] comprises nine photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2.5 metres (8 ft).

[[Image:Panorama of Edo.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Panorama of Edo (now Tokyo), 1865 or 1866. Five albumen prints joined to form a panorama.]]
<div style="clear:both; height:1px">&nbsp;</div>

While the signatures he shared with his brother are one source of confusion in attributing images to Felice Beato, there are additional difficulties in this task. When Stillfried & Andersen bought up Beato's stock they subsequently followed the common practice of 19th century commercial photographers of reselling the photographs under their own name. They (and others) also altered Beato's images by adding numbers, names and other inscriptions associated with their firm in the negative, on the print or on the mount. For many of Beato's images that were not hand-coloured, Stillfried & Andersen produced hand-coloured versions. All of these factors have caused Beato's photographs to be frequently misattributed to Stillfried & Andersen. Fortunately, Beato captioned many of his photographs by writing in [[graphite]] or ink on the back of the print. When such photographs are mounted, the captions can still often be seen through the front of the image and read with the use of a mirror. Besides helping in the identification of the subject of the image and sometimes in supplying a date for the exposure, these captions provide one method of identifying Felice Beato as the creator of many images.
