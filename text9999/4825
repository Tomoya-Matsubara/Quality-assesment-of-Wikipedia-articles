'''''Rock Steady''''' is the fifth album by [[United States|American]] [[third wave ska]] band [[No Doubt]], released [[December 11]], [[2001]] on [[Interscope Records]] (see [[2001 in music]]). The band began writing the album with initial recording sessions in [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]]. The group then traveled to [[London]] and [[Jamaica]] to work with various performers, songwriters, and producers. [[Sly & Robbie]], [[The Neptunes]], and [[William Orbit]] were among the many artists No Doubt collaborated with on the album.

As a result of the many collaborations, ''Rock Steady'' touches on many musical styles. The album focuses on the [[New Wave music|New Wave]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[reggae]] influences present in the band's earlier work while incorporating [[dub music|dub]], [[ragga]], and [[dance music|dance]] styles. The band attempted to capture the vibe of Jamacian [[dancehall]] music, and experimented with writing songs without its standard instrumentation. Singer [[Gwen Stefani]] wrote her lyrics quickly in comparison to previous records, and dealt with topics ranging from partying to ruminations on her relationship with [[Gavin Rossdale]].

''Rock Steady'' received mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics, and it was nominated for [[Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[45th Grammy Awards]]. The album served as a commercial comeback for the band, surpassing sales of its previous offering, ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' (2000). ''Rock Steady'' yielded four [[single (music)|singles]], two of which won the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].

==Background and production==
Every night on the tour to support its 2000 album ''Return of Saturn'', No Doubt would throw aftershow parties where people would dance to Jamacian dancehall music. During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall grooves for their next album.<ref name="party">Edwards, Gavin.

Many of the [[demo (music)|demos]] recorded during these early sessions were used in the final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally positive reviews from critics. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said it was "impressive to hear No Doubt summon the musical imagination to transcend the formula that used to imprison them"<ref name="rs"/> and ranked ''Rock Steady'' number 316 on its 2003 list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name="list"/> Stephen Erlewine of [[All Music Guide]] referred to the album as "a good, hooky, stylish mainstream pop record".<ref name="amg"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' remarked that there was "something oddly flimsy" about No Doubt that prevented it from becoming a milestone in pop music, but that the band's "party-throwing skills improve with each new gathering."<ref name="ew"/> ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' commented that the band sounded like it had "growing pains" and was unsure of its place in mainstream rock, predicting that No Doubt would either become a singles band "or go all [[Radiohead]] on us and make an album of [[experimental music|avant]]-[[jazz]]-[[electro music|electro]]-acid-funk-[[polka]]."<ref name="stylus"/>

Many reviewers focused on the large number of styles that ''Rock Steady'' incorporates. ''[[PopMatters]]'', noting that ''Rock Steady'' maintains the introspection of ''Return of Saturn'' without the latter's "longing and wistfulness", stated that "it is to No Doubt's credit<U+2026>that they manage to keep the album together with little more than their collective personalities."<ref name="pm"/> ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', however, called it "an intermittently engaging but overall shapeless collection<U+2026>the product of happy-go-lucky musicians who once cavorted in bad track suits but now spend their days commuting between London, Jamaica and Los Angeles seeking the wisdom of expensive studio geeks."<ref>Howe, Rupert.
