'''''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''''' ({{Lang-ja|<U+9F8D><U+9A64>}} "prancing dragon") was a light [[aircraft carrier]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the early 1930s. Small and lightly built in an attempt to exploit a loophole in the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922, she proved to be top-heavy and only marginally stable and was back in the [[shipyard]] for modifications to address those issues within a year of completion. With her stability improved, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' returned to service and was employed in operations during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. During World War II, she provided air support for operations in [[Philippines Campaign (1941<U+2013>1942)|the Philippines]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], and the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign|Dutch East Indies]], where her aircraft participated in the [[Second Battle of the Java Sea]]. During the [[Indian Ocean raid]] in April 1942, the carrier attacked British merchant shipping with both her guns and her aircraft. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' next participated in the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands]] in June. She was sunk by American carrier aircraft at the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] on 24 August 1942.

==Design==
''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was planned as a light carrier of around {{convert|8000|t|LT|sp=us}} [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]] to exploit a loophole in the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922<ref name=c3/> that carriers under {{convert|10000|LT|t}} standard displacement were not regarded as "aircraft carriers".<ref>See: [[s:Washington_Naval_Treaty,_1922#AIRCRAFT_CARRIER|Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter II, Part 4, Definitions]]</ref> While ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was under construction, Article Three of the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930 closed the above-mentioned loophole; consequently, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was the only light aircraft carrier of her type to be completed by Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microworks.net/pacific/road_to_war/london_treaty.htm|title=International Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament|year=1930|accessdate=21 June 2013}}; See Part 1, Article 3, Paragraph 1.</ref>

''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' had a length of {{convert|179.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]].<ref name=c3>Chesneau, p. 163</ref> She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20.32|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|5.56|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|8000|t|LT|sp=us}} at standard load and {{convert|10150|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load. Her crew consisted of 600 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=j5>Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 45</ref>

[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D> Front.jpg|thumb|left|Bow view of ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'', 1933]]
To keep ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''{{'}}s weight to 8,000 metric tons, her hull was lightly built and no armor could be provided, although some protective plating was added abreast the machinery spaces and [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s. She was also designed with only a single [[hangar]], which would have left her with an extremely low profile (there being just {{convert|4.6|m|ftin|sp=us}} of [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] [[amidships]] and {{convert|3.0|m|ftin|sp=us}} aft). Between the time the carrier was laid down in 1929 and launched in 1931, however, the Navy doubled her aircraft stowage requirement to 48 in order to give her a more capable air group. This necessitated the addition of a second hangar atop the first, raising freeboard to {{convert|14.9|m|ftin|sp=us}}. Coupled with the ship's narrow beam, the consequent top-heaviness made her minimally stable in rough seas, despite the fitting of [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] active [[stabilizer (ship)|stabilizer]]s. This was a common flaw amongst many treaty-circumventing Japanese warships of her generation.<ref name=Brown17>Brown 1977, p. 17</ref>

The [[Tomozuru Incident]] of 12 March 1934, in which a top-heavy [[torpedo boat]] capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to investigate the stability of all their ships, resulting in a number of design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'', already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] for modifications that strengthened her keel and added [[ballast]] and shallow [[torpedo bulge]]s to improve her stability. Her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.<ref name=ptc>Parshall, Tully & Casse</ref>

Shortly afterward, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was one of many Japanese warships caught in a [[typhoon]] on 25 September 1935 while on maneuvers during the "[[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#The Fourth Fleet Incident|Fourth Fleet Incident]]." The ship's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]], [[flight deck]] and superstructure were damaged and her hangar was flooded. Her [[forecastle]] was raised one deck and her bow was remodeled with more [[flare (ship)|flare]] to make her less wet forward.<ref name=ptc/> After these modifications, her beam and draft increased to {{convert|20.78|m|ftin|sp=us}} and {{convert|7.08|m|ftin|sp=us}} respectively. Her displacement also increased to {{convert|10600|t|LT|sp=us}} at standard load and {{convert|12732|t|LT|sp=us}} at normal load. Her crew also grew to 924 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=j5/>

===Machinery===
The ship was fitted with two geared [[steam turbine]] sets with a total of {{convert|65000|shp|kW|lk=in}}, each driving one [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]], using steam provided by six [[Kampon]] [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' had a designed speed of {{convert|29|kn|lk=in}}, but reached {{convert|29.5|kn}} during her [[sea trial]]s from {{convert|65270|shp|abbr=on}}. The ship carried {{convert|2490|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], which gave her a range of {{convert|10000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}. The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship's starboard side amidships and exhausted horizontally below flight deck level through two small funnels.<ref name=Brown18>Brown 1977, p. 18</ref>

===Flight Deck & Hangars===
''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was a [[flush deck|flush-decked]] carrier without an [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]] [[superstructure]]; her navigating and control bridge was located just under the forward lip of the flight deck in a long glassed-in "greenhouse". Her superstructure was set back {{convert|23.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} from the ship's [[stem (ship)|stem]], giving ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' a distinctive open bow. Her {{convert|156.5|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} flight deck was {{convert|23|m|ftin|sp=us}} wide and extended well beyond the aft end of her superstructure, supported by a pair of pillars. Six transverse [[arrestor wire]]s were installed on the flight deck and were later modernized in 1936 to stop a {{convert|6000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} aircraft.<ref name=Brown17/> The ship's hangars were both {{convert|102.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} long and {{convert|18.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} wide, and had an approximate area of {{convert|3871|sqm|0}}.<ref name=p5>Peattie, p. 235</ref> Between them, they gave the ship the capacity to store 48 aircraft, although only 37 could be operated at one time.<ref name=Brown17/> After the Fourth Fleet Incident, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''{{'}}s bridge and the leading edge of the flight deck were rounded off to make them more streamlined. This reduced the length of the flight deck by {{convert|2|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref name=ptc/>

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two [[Elevator#Aircraft_elevators|elevators]]; the forward platform measured {{convert|15.7|x|11.1|m|ft|1|sp=us}} and the rear {{convert|10.8|x|8.0|m|ft|1|sp=us}}.<ref name=p5/> The small rear elevator became a problem as the IJN progressively fielded larger and more modern carrier aircraft. Of all the aircraft in front-line service in 1941, only the [[Nakajima B5N]] "Kate" [[torpedo bomber]] would fit, when positioned at an angle with its wings folded. This effectively made ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' a single-elevator carrier and considerably hindered transfer of aircraft in and out of the hangars for rearming and refueling during combat operations.<ref name=Brown17/>

===Armament===
As completed, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''{{'}}s primary [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA)]] armament comprised six twin-gun mounts equipped with 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun|12.7-centimeter Type 89]] [[dual-purpose gun]]s mounted on projecting [[sponson]]s, three on either side of the carrier's hull.<ref name=Brown18/> When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of {{convert|14700|m|yd|sp=us}}; they had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|9440|m|ft|sp=us}} at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 192<U+2013>93</ref> Twenty-four anti-aircraft (AA) Type 93 [[13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun]]s were also fitted, in twin<ref name=Brown18/> and quadruple mounts.<ref name=ptc/> Their effective range against aircraft was {{convert|700|-|1500|m|yd|sp=us}}. The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]] reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, p. 202</ref>

During the carrier's 1934<U+2013>36 refit, two of the {{convert|12.7|cm|sp=us|adj=on}} mountings were exchanged for two twin-gun mounts for [[license-built]] [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-aircraft gun|Hotchkiss]] [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25&nbsp;mm Type 96]] light AA guns,<ref name=ptc/> resulting in a savings of approximately {{convert|60|LT|t|abbr=on}} of top-weight that improved the ship's overall stability.<ref name=Brown17/> This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to "handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, [and] it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast".<ref>Stille, p. 51</ref> These {{convert|25|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns had an effective range of {{convert|1500|-|3000|m|yd|sp=us}}, and an effective ceiling of {{convert|5500|m|ft|sp=us}} at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.<ref>Campbell, p. 200</ref> The machine-guns were replaced during a brief refit in April<U+2013>May 1942 with six triple-mount {{convert|25|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} AA guns.<ref name=ptc/>

==Construction and service==
[[File:Ryujo&D1A2.jpg|right|thumb|''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' during the 1930s with a pair of [[Aichi D1A2]] [[dive bomber]]s overhead]]
Following the [[Japanese ship-naming conventions]] for aircraft carriers, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was named "Prancing Dragon".<ref>Silverstone, p. 335</ref> The ship was [[Keel|laid down]] at the [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi's]] [[Yokohama]] shipyard on 26 November 1929. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2 April 1931, towed to [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] on 25 April for [[fitting out]], and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 9 May 1933 with Captain [[Toshio Matsunaga]] in command. While training in mid-1933, her initial air group consisted of nine [[Mitsubishi B1M]]2 (Type 13) torpedo bombers, plus three spares, and three [[Nakajima A1N|A1N1]] (Type 3) [[fighter plane|fighters]], plus two spares. Matsunaga was relieved by Captain [[Torao Kuwabara]] on 20 October. After the Tomozuru Incident, the ship was reconstructed from 26 May to 20 August 1934.<ref name=tu>Tully & Casse</ref>

Captain [[Ichiro Ono]] assumed command on 15 November 1934 and ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' became the flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Hideho Wada]]'s [[Carrier Division 1]]. The following month the ship was chosen to evaluate [[dive bomber|dive-bombing]] tactics using six [[Nakajima E4N]]2-C Type 90 [[reconnaissance aircraft]], six [[Yokosuka B3Y]]1 Type 92 torpedo bombers, and a dozen [[Nakajima A2N|A2N1]] Type 90 fighters. The reconnaissance aircraft proved to be unsuitable after several months' testing. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she was attached to the [[IJN Fourth Fleet]]. The fleet was caught in a typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs, modifications, and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936. On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain [[Shun'ichi Kira]].<ref name=tu/>

In mid-1936, the ship was used to evaluate a dozen [[Aichi D1A]] dive bombers and dive-bombing tactics. She also embarked at that time 24 [[Nakajima A4N|A4N1]] fighters, plus four and eight spare aircraft respectively. In September, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' resumed her role as flagship of Carrier Division 1, now commanded by Rear Admiral [[Sabur<U+014D> Sat<U+014D>]]. Her air group now consisted of a mixture of B3Y1 torpedo bombers, D1A1 dive bombers and A2N fighters, but her torpedo bombers were transferred after fleet maneuvers in October demonstrated effective dive bombing tactics. Captain [[Katsuo Abe]] assumed command of the ship on 16 November.<ref name=tu/>

Carrier Division 1 arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 to support operations of the Japanese Army in [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]]. Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters (plus four spares) and 15 D1A dive bombers. The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai.<ref name=tu/> The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 [[Nationalist Chinese Air Force|Nationalist]] [[Curtiss Hawk III]] fighters and claimed to have shot down six without loss. The following day, four A4Ns claimed to have shot down nine Chinese fighters without loss to themselves.<ref name=h4>Hata, Izawa & Shores, p. 144</ref> The carriers returned to [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] at the beginning of September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref name=tu/> Nine fighters from ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters. While escorting another raid later that same day, the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down.<ref name=h4/> The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October. Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and [[Nanking]]. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral [[Tomoshige Samejima]]'s [[Carrier Division 2]].<ref name=tu/>

In February 1938 the ship replaced her A4N [[biplane]]s with nine [[Mitsubishi A5M]] "Claude" [[monoplane]] fighters. The division supported Japanese operations in Southern China in March<U+2013>April and again in October. Captain [[Kiichi Hasegawa]] assumed command on 15 November 1939. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was given a refit that lasted from December 1939 through January 1940 and became a training ship until November when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Kakuji Kakuta]]'s [[Carrier Division 3]]. Hasegawa was relieved by Captain [[Ushie Sugimoto]] on 21 June. The ship's air group then consisted of 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 16 A5M4 fighters. When the [[First Air Fleet]] was formed on 10 April 1941, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' became flagship of [[Carrier Division 4]].<ref name=tu/>

===World War II===
[[File:RyujoFlightdeck.jpg|right|thumb|Overhead view of ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' in 1942]]
The ship's assignment at the beginning of the [[Pacific War]] was to support the invasion of the [[Philippines]], initially by attacking the American naval base at [[Davao]], [[Mindanao]] on the morning of 8 December.<ref group=Note>[[Japan Standard Time]] is 19 hours ahead of [[Hawaiian Standard Time]], so in Japan, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] happened on 8 December.</ref> Her air group had not changed, but four of each type of aircraft were spares. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''{{'}}s initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller, follow-on airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two [[Consolidated PBY]] [[seaplane]]s on the ground for the loss of one B5N and A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British [[oil tanker]] south of Davao.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. I, pp. 164, 191<U+2013>92</ref> In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the [[Malay Peninsula]].<ref name=tu/>

In mid-February 1942, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''{{'}}s aircraft attacked ships evacuating from Singapore, claiming eight ships damaged, three burnt, and four sunk. They also covered convoys carrying troops to Sumatra. The ship was unsuccessfully attacked by several [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers of [[No. 84 Squadron RAF]] on 14 February. The following day two waves of B5Ns, totalling 13 aircraft, attacked the British [[heavy cruiser]] {{HMS|Exeter|68|2}}, but only managed to damage the ship's [[Supermarine Walrus]] seaplane. Follow-on attacks later that day were also unsuccessful. Two days later, B5Ns destroyed {{HNLMS|Van Ghent|1926|6}}, a Dutch destroyer that had run aground in the Gaspar Strait and been abandoned on 14 February.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. II, pp. 88, 90, 93, 109, 123<U+2013>24, 199</ref> The carrier sailed to [[Saigon]], [[French Indochina]] the next day and arrived on 20 February. A week later she was assigned to cover the convoy taking troops to [[Jakarta]], [[Java]].<ref name=tu/> Her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and six B5Ns sank the American destroyer {{USS|Pope|DD-225|2}} after it had been abandoned by its crew.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. II, p. 306</ref> Six other B5Ns bombed the port of [[Semarang]], possibly setting one merchantman on fire.<ref name=tu/>

''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' arrived in Singapore on 5 March and the ship supported operations in Sumatra and escorted convoys to [[Burma]] and the [[Andaman Islands]] for the rest of the month.<ref name=tu/> On 1 April, while the 1st Air Fleet was starting [[Indian Ocean raid|its raid in the Indian Ocean]], Malay Force, consisting of ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'', six [[cruiser]]s, and four destroyers, left Burma on a mission to destroy merchant shipping in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. B5Ns damaged one freighter on 5 April before the force split into three groups. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''{{'}}s aircraft bombed the small ports of [[Cocanada]] and [[Vizagapatam]] on the southeastern coast of India the next day, doing little damage, in addition to claiming two ships sunk and six more damaged during the day. The carrier and her escorts, the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Yura||2}} and the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Yugiri||2}} claimed to have sunk three more ships by gunfire. All together, Malay Force sank 19 ships totalling almost {{GRT|100,000|first=yes}},<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. II, pp. 393, 408<U+2013>11</ref> before reuniting on 7 April and arriving at Singapore on 11 April. A week later, her B5Ns were detached for torpedo training and the ship arrived at Kure on 23 April for a brief refit.<ref name=tu/>

The newly commissioned carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'y<U+014D>||2}} joined Carrier Division 4, under the command of Kakuta, with ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' on 3 May 1942. They formed the core of the 2nd Carrier Strike Force, part of the Northern Force, tasked to attack the [[Aleutian Islands]], an operation planned to seize several of the islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the [[Kurile Islands]] while the main body of the American fleet was occupied [[Battle of Midway|defending Midway]]. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>''{{'}}s air group now consisted of 12 A6M2 Zeros and 18 B5Ns,<ref>Parshall & Tully, pp. 43<U+2013>46, 459</ref> plus two spares of each type. The ship transferred to [[Mutsu Bay]] on 25 May and then to [[Paramushiro]] on 1 June before departing the same day for the Aleutians.<ref name=tu/>

At dawn on 3 June, she launched nine B5Ns, escorted by six Zeros, to attack [[Battle of Dutch Harbor|Dutch Harbor]] on [[Unalaska Island]]. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only six of the B5Ns and all of the Zeros were able to make it through the bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the [[oil depot|oil storage tanks]] and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' from the second strike was damaged by a [[Curtiss P-40]] and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the [[Akutan Zero]], remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bomber was shot down by [[flak]] during the attack.<ref>Brown 2009, pp. 147<U+2013>48</ref>

''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' arrived back at Mutsu Bay on 24 June, but departed for the Aleutians four days later to cover the second reinforcement convoy to [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska Island]]s and remained in the area until 7 July in case of an American counterattack. She arrived at Kure on 13 July for a refit and was transferred to Carrier Division 2 a day later.<ref name=tu/>

The [[Guadalcanal Campaign|American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi]] on 7 August caught the Japanese by surprise. The next day, ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' was transferred to Carrier Division 1 and departed for [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] on 16 August together with the other two carriers of the division, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh<U+014D>kaku||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}. Her air group consisted of 24 Zeros and nine B5N2s.<ref>Lundstrom, pp. 92<U+2013>94</ref> Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Combined Fleet]], ordered Truk to be bypassed and the fleet refuelled at sea after an American carrier was spotted near the [[Solomon Islands]] on 21 August.<ref>Brown 2009, p. 169</ref> At 01:45 on 24 August, Vice Admiral [[Ch<U+016B>ichi Nagumo]], commander of the Mobile Force, ordered ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' and the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}}, escorted by two destroyers, detached to move in advance of the troop convoy bound for [[Guadalcanal]] and to attack the Allied air base at [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]] if no carriers were spotted. This Detached Force was commanded by Rear Admiral [[Ch<U+016B>ichi Hara]] in ''Tone''.<ref>Lundstrom, p. 109</ref>

''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' launched two small airstrikes, totalling six B5Ns and 15 Zeros, beginning at 12:20 once the Diversionary Force was {{convert|200|nmi}} north of [[Lunga Point]]. Four [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters from [[United States Marine|Marine]] Fighter Squadron [[VMF-223]] on [[combat air patrol]] (CAP) near Henderson Field spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft around 14:20 and alerted the defenders. Ten more Wildcats from VMF-223 and [[VMF-212]] [[Scrambling (military)|scrambled]], as well as two [[United States Army Air Corps]] [[Bell P-400]]s from the [[67th Fighter Squadron]] in response. Nine of the Zeros [[strafe]]d the airfield while the B5Ns bombed it with {{convert|60|kg|adj=on|sp=us}} bombs to little effect. The Americans claimed to have shot down 19 aircraft, but only three Zeros and three B5Ns were lost, although another B5N was forced to crash-land. Only three Wildcats were shot down in turn.<ref>Lundstrom, pp. 116<U+2013>19</ref>

Around 14:40, the Detached Force was spotted again by several search aircraft from the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, although the Japanese ships did not immediately spot the Americans. They launched three Zeros as CAP at 14:55, shortly before two of the searching [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers near-missed ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' {{convert|150|m|sp=us}} astern with four {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bombs three minutes later. Two more Zeros reinforced the CAP shortly after 15:00, just in time to intercept two more searching Avengers, shooting down one. In the meantime, the carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} had launched an airstrike against the Detached Force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]]es and eight Avengers; the long range precluded fighter escort. They sighted the carrier shortly afterward and attacked. They hit ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' three times with {{convert|1000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bombs and one torpedo; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms. No aircraft from either ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' or ''Saratoga'' were shot down in the attack.<ref>Lundstrom, pp. 116, 119<U+2013>22</ref>

The bomb hits set the carrier on fire and she took on a [[list (watercraft)|list]] from the flooding caused by the torpedo hit. ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' turned north at 14:08, but her list continued to increase although the fires were put out. The progressive flooding disabled her machinery and caused her to stop at 14:20. The order to abandon ship was given at 15:15 and the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Amatsukaze||2}} moved alongside to rescue the crew. The ships were bombed several times by multiple B-17s without effect before ''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'' capsized about 17:55 at coordinates {{Coord|06|10|S|160|50|E|display=inline,title}} with the loss of 7 officers and 113 crewmen.<ref name=tu/>
