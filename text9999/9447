'''Frederic Jones''' (1832 <U+2013> 8 September 1890) was a [[New Zealand]] politician. Originally from England, he settled in the colony in 1863 for health reasons.

==Early life==

Jones was the third son of John Humphreys Jones, from the [[Shropshire]] region in [[England]]. He received his education from the Reverend G. Wharton, [[vicar]] of [[Kinver]], and learned the trades of architecture and surveyor. He was employed by the architecture firm Haslam and Butler in [[London]].<ref name="obituary Jones">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18900908.2.28.1|title=Frederic Jones, M.H.R.|date=Issue 6954, 8 September 1890|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref>

In January 1863, Jones arrived in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] with his brother T. D. Jones on the ''Chariot of Fame''. His second brother, John Humphreys, remained in [[Dalston]], London. The main reason for emigration was to improve his health by a change of climate.<ref name="obituary Jones" />

Jones was for several years employed in the office of the builder Jenkins, and he worked in the office of Messrs W. Montgomery and Co after that. Jenkins, Jones and a Mr Innes started a flax mill in [[Kaiapoi]], but the business failed. The site was later occupied by the [[Kaiapoi Woollen Manufacturing Company]].<ref name="obituary Jones" />

==Political career==

Jones held numerous offices in local government, and was later described as the foremost expert in the country on local government matters.<ref name="obituary Jones" />

He was a member of the Heathcote Road Board, including its chairman. In 1880, he was chosen to represent the [[Heathcote Valley|Heathcote]] district on the South Waimakariri Board of Conservators, which later became the South Waimakariri River Board. For some time, he chaired the board and retired from the it in December 1887, owing to parliamentary workload. In January 1882, he was chosen as the Heathcote Road Board representative on the Drainage Board, but he resigned from that role in May of that year.<ref name="obituary Jones" />

In 1881, he was elected onto the [[Selwyn District|Selwyn County Council]] as the representative for the Heathcote riding, and remained a councillor until his death. His main contributions were a principal part in organising the [[Halswell]] drainage scheme and securing the [[Cashmere, New Zealand|Cashmere]] Hills domain as a public reserve. From 1883 until his death, he was the chairman of the board that administered this domain. He was appointed in 1885 by the Selwyn County Council as their representative on the Hospital Board, and on the Charitable Aid Board, the latter of which he chaired in 1886-87. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the Hospital Board.<ref name="obituary Jones" />

The death on 17 December 1886 of [[John Coster]], who represented the [[Heathcote (New Zealand electorate)|Heathcote electorate]] in [[Parliament of New Zealand|parliament]], caused the [[Heathcote by-election, 1887|February 1887 Heathcote by-election]]. There were several people interested in standing in the electorate, including the former Heathcote MP [[William Wynn-Williams]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=EP18861221.2.24|title=The Heathcote Seat.|date=Volume XXXII, Issue 185, 21 December 1886|publisher=Evening Post|pages=2|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref>, but with Jones and the current [[Mayor of Christchurch]], [[Aaron Ayers]] considered as the only contenders of having a chance of success<ref name="race down to Jones and Ayers">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18870201.2.8|title=THE HEATHCOTE ELECTION.|date=Issue 5820, 8 January 1887|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref>, most other candidates withdrew from the contest. On nomination day on 2 February 1887, Jones and Ayers were nominated. A third person, James Arthur Williams, nominated himself, but could not find anybody to second this motion. Thus, the by-election was a two-person contest.<ref name="1887 Heathcote by-election nomination">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18870202.2.17|title=The Heathcote Election.|date=Issue 5841, 2 February 1887|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> On election day, 8 February 1887, the majority opinion was that Ayers would win.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18870208.2.23|title=Heathcote Election.|date=Issue 5846, 8 February 1887|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> There was great interest in the election, as evidenced by the high turnout. Jones had a considerable majority over Ayers, with 527 and 336 votes, respectively. The 191 votes majority was mirrored by Jones having won all four polling stations.<ref name="1887 Heathcote by-election">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18870209.2.25.1|title=RESULT OF THE POLLING|date=Issue 5847, 9 February 1887|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref><ref>''New Zealand Parliamentary Record 1840-1984'' by J. O. Wilson (1985, Government Printer, Wellington)</ref>

At the 26 September 1887 general election, Jones and J. H. Hopkins were nominated. Hopkins was an active supporter of Jones for the by-election some seven months earlier and had proposed him at the 2 February nomination meeting<ref name="1887 Heathcote by-election nomination" />, but had developed policy differences with regards to the economic recession.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18870919.2.28.1.4|title=Heathcote|date=Issue 6036, 19 September 1887|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> Jones and Hopkins received 756 and 309 votes, respectively. Hence, the majority for Jones was 447 votes, and he was elected to the [[10th New Zealand Parliament|10<sup>th</sup> Parliament]].<ref name="1887 general election Heathcote">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TS18870927.2.33.7|title=Heathcote.|date=Issue 6043, 27 September 1887|publisher=The Star|pages=4|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="NZETC Jones">{{cite book|title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Canterbury Provincial District|publisher=The Cyclopedia Company Limited|location=Christchurch|date=1903|chapter=Mr. Frederick Jones|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc03Cycl-t1-body1-d3-d6-d40.html|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref>

Jones was a first cousin of [[Edward Wingfield Humphreys]]<ref name="obituary Jones" />, who represented the [[Christchurch North (New Zealand electorate)|Christchurch North]] electorate in 1889-90.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18890620.2.22|title=Christchurch North Election|date=Issue 6577, 20 June 1889|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref>

==Death==

Jones died on 8 September 1890 after several months of illness at his home in Lichfield Street, [[Christchurch Central City]].<ref name="death notice">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS18900909.2.14|title=DEATHS.|date=Issue 6955, 9 September 1890|publisher=The Star|pages=3|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> On the day of his death, the House of Representatives adjourned their meeting for almost five hours out of respect for the deceased member.<ref name="Parliament 8 Sept 1890">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=HBH18900909.2.12.1|title=HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.|date=Volume XXV, Issue 8768, 9 September 1890|publisher=Hawke's Bay Herald|pages=2|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> He was buried at the [[Barbadoes Street Cemetery]] on 10 September.<ref name="death notice" />

As his death was close to the next general election, which was held in December 1890, there was no by-election for the vacant seat. The Heathcote seat was won by [[William Tanner (New Zealand)|William Tanner]].<ref name="1890 Heathcote election">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TS18901206.2.42|title=HEATHCOTE.|date=Issue 7029, 6 December 1890|publisher=The Star|pages=4|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref>
