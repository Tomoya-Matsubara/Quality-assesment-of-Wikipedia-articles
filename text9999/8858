[[Image:Dominospiel.JPG|thumb|right|A game of dominoes]]
'''Dominoes''' (or '''dominos''') generally refers to the collective gaming pieces making up a ''domino set'' (sometimes called a ''deck'' or ''pack'') or to the subcategory of [[tile game]]s played with domino pieces. In the area of mathematical [[tessellation|tilings]] and [[polyomino]]es, the word domino often refers to any [[rectangle]] formed from joining two congruent squares edge to edge. The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 120 dominoes, colloquially nicknamed ''bones'', ''cards'', ''tiles'', ''tickets'', ''stones'', or ''spinners''. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its ''face'' into two square ''ends''. Each end is marked with a number of ''spots'' (also called ''[[pips]]'') or is ''blank''. The backs of the dominoes in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to [[playing cards]] or [[dice]], in that a variety of games can be played with a set.

==Construction and composition of domino sets==
European-style dominoes are traditionally made of [[ivory]]/bone, or a dark hardwood such as [[ebony]], with contrasting black or white pips ([[inlay|inlaid]] or [[paint]]ed). Alternatively, domino sets have been made from many different natural materials: stone (e.g., [[marble]], [[granite]] or [[soapstone]]); other hardwoods (e.g., [[ash tree|ash]], [[oak]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] and [[cedrus|cedar]]); metals (e.g., [[brass]] or [[pewter]]); [[ceramic]] clay, or even [[frosted glass]] or [[crystal]]. These sets have a more novel look, and the often heavier weight makes them feel more substantial, but such materials and the resulting products are usually much more expensive than polymer materials. 
[[Image:Dominoes.jpg|thumb|left|Domino tiles]]
Modern commercial domino sets are usually made of synthetic materials, such as [[ABS plastic|ABS]] or [[polystyrene]] [[plastic]]s, or [[Bakelite]] and other [[phenolic resin]]s; many sets approximate the look and feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of card stock like that for [[playing cards]]. Such sets are lightweight, compact and inexpensive, but like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze.

The traditional set of dominoes contains one unique piece for each possible combination of two ends with zero to six spots, and is known as a ''double-six'' set because the highest-value piece has six pips on each end (the "double six"). The spots from one to six are generally arranged as they are on six-sided [[dice]], but because there are also blank ends having no spots there are seven possible faces, allowing 28 unique pieces in a double-six set.

However, this is a relatively small number especially when playing with more than four people, so many domino sets are "extended" by introducing ends with greater numbers of spots, which increases the number of unique combinations of ends and thus of pieces. Each progressively larger set increases the maximum number of pips on an end by three, so the common extended sets are ''double-nine'', ''double-twelve'', ''double-fifteen'' and ''double-eighteen''. Larger sets such as ''double-twenty-one'' can theoretically exist but are rarely seen in retail stores, as identifying the number of pips on each domino becomes difficult, and a double-twenty-one set would have 253 pieces, far more than is normally necessary for most domino games even with eight players.

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2009}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bemanning tijdens een spel domino aan boord van een schip TMnr 60008507.jpg|thumb|Dutch sailors playing dominoes, 1890s.]]
Domino pieces were historically carved from [[ivory]] or animal [[bone]] with small, round pips of inset [[ebony]]. The game's name comes from the pieces' resemblance to [[Carnival of Venice|Venetian Carnival]] masks known as ''domini'', which were white with black spots. These masks were so named, in turn, because they resembled [[France|French]] [[priest]]s' winter hoods, being black on the outside and white on the inside. The name ultimately derives from the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] ''dominus'', meaning "lord" or "master."

Many different domino sets have been used for centuries in various parts of world to play a variety of domino games.  Dominoes are played by grown-ups and young people throughout the world. Each domino originally represented one of the 21 results of throwing two dice. One half of each domino is set with the pips from one die and the other half contains the pips from the second die. Chinese sets also introduce duplicates of some throws and divide the dominoes into two classes: military and civil. [[Chinese dominoes]] are also longer than typical European dominoes. Over time Chinese dominoes also evolved into the tile set used to play [[Mah Jong]], a game which swept across the United States in the early to mid 1920s and has enjoyed moderate popularity, especially in its "solitaire" form, since that time. It is played a lot in the Caribbean, especially in Barbados and Jamaica. 

The early 18th century witnessed dominoes making their way to Europe, making their first appearance in [[Italy]]. The game changed somewhat in the translation from Chinese to the European culture. European domino sets contain neither class distinctions nor the duplicates that went with them. Instead, European sets contain seven additional dominoes, with six of these representing the values that result from throwing a single die with the other half of the tile left blank, and the seventh domino representing the blank-blank (0<U+2013>0) combination.

Ivory Dominoes were routinely used in 19th century rural England in the settling of disputes over traditional grazing boundaries, and were commonly referred to as "bonesticks" (see Hartley, Land Law in West Lancashire in the mid- 19th Century, Farm Gazette, March 1984).

==Tiles and suits==
[[Image:Dominomatrix.svg|thumb|right|Complete double-six set]]Domino tiles, also known as ''bones'', are twice as long as they are wide, a line in the middle suggesting a division into two squares. The value of either side is the number of spots or ''pips''. In the most common variant (Double Six) the values range from ''blank'' or 0 (no pips) to 6.<ref name=hoyle1950>{{ Cite book

}}. Republished 1994 by Wordsworth Editions.</ref> The sum of the two values, i.e. the total number of pips, may be referred to as the ''rank'' or ''weight'' of a tile, and a tile with more pips may be called ''heavier'' than a ''lighter'' tile with fewer pips.

Tiles are generally named after their two values; e.g. ''2<U+2013>5'' or ''5<U+2013>2'' are alternative ways of describing the tile with the values 2 and 5. Tiles that have the same value on both ends are called ''doubles'', and are typically referred to as double-zero, double-one etc.<ref name=hoyle1950 /> Tiles with two different values are called ''singles''.<ref name="kelleylugo2003" />

Every tile belongs to the two ''suits'' of its two values, e.g. ''0<U+2013>3'' belongs both to the ''blank suit'' (or 0 suit) and to the 3 suit. Naturally the doubles form an exception in that each double belongs to only one suit.<ref name=hoyle1950 /> In [[42 (dominoes)|42]], the doubles are treated like an additional ''suit of doubles'', so that e.g. the double-six ''6<U+2013>6'' belongs both to the 6 suit and the suit of doubles.

===Domino sets===<!-- If you got here by a link to the old miscapitalised heading, please fix that link. -->
The five most common domino sets commercially available are:
{|
|-
! Set !! Tiles !! Pips
|-
! Double-6
| style="text-align:center;"| 28
| style="text-align:center;"| 168
|-
! Double-9
| style="text-align:center;"| 55
| style="text-align:center;"| 495
|-
! Double-12
| style="text-align:center;"| 91
| style="text-align:center;"| 1092
|-
! Double-15
| style="text-align:center;"| 136
| style="text-align:center;"| 2040
|-
! Double-18
| style="text-align:center;"| 190
| style="text-align:center;"| 3420
|}

These numbers may be computed quite easily using [[triangular number]]s: for double-''n'' dominoes, there are <math>\tfrac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}</math> tiles and <math>\tfrac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}</math> pips. Generally the most commonly used sets are double-6 and double-9, though the other three sets are more popular for games involving several players or for players looking for long domino games.

==Rules==
{{See also|List of domino games}}

===Basic rules===

Most domino games are ''blocking games'', i.e. the objective is to empty one's hand whilst blocking the opponents. In the end, a score may be determined by counting the pips in the losing players' hands. In ''scoring games'' the scoring is different and happens mostly during gameplay, making it the principal objective.<ref name="kelleylugo2003" />

;Block game
The most basic domino variant is for two players and requires a double six set. The 28 tiles are shuffled face down and form the '''stock''' or '''boneyard'''. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay.
One player begins by '''downing''' (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. This tile starts the '''line of play''', a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. A player who cannot do this draws another tile from the boneyard until they can use one in the line. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is '''blocked''' because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.<ref name=hoyle1950 />

;Draw game
In the Draw game, players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile, and they are not allowed to pass before the stock is (nearly) empty.<ref name=hoyle1950 /> The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock.<ref name="kelleylugo2003">{{Cite book

|title=My Book of Indoor Games
|last=Squareman
|first=Clarence
|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13022
|year=1916}}</ref>

Adaptations of both games can accommodate more than two players, who may play individually or in teams.<ref name=hoyle1950 />

===Line of play===
[[Image:Muggins.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Muggins (domino game)|Muggins]] played with multi-colored tiles. The doubles serve as spinners, allowing the line of play to branch.]]The '''line of play''' is the configuration of played tiles on the table. Typically it starts with a single tile, from which it grows in two opposite directions when the players add matching tiles. (In practice the players often play tiles at right angles when the line of play gets too close to the edge of the table.)

The rules for the line of play often differ from one variant to another. In many rules the doubles serve as '''spinners''', i.e. they can be played on all four sides, causing the line of play to branch. Sometimes the first tile is required to be a double, and serves as the only spinner.<ref name="kelleylugo2003" /> In some games such as [[Chicken Foot (domino game)|Chicken Foot]], all sides of a spinner must be occupied before anybody is allowed to play elsewhere. [[Matador (domino game)|Matador]] has unusual rules for matching. [[Bendomino]] uses curved tiles, so that one side of the line of play (or both) may be blocked for geometrical reasons.

In [[Mexican Train]] and other '''Trains games''', the game starts with a spinner from which various '''trains''' branch off. Most trains are owned by a player, and in most situations players are only allowed to extend their own train.

===Scoring===
In ''blocking games'' the scoring happens at the end of the game. After a player has emptied their hand, thereby winning the game for their team, the score consists of the total pip count of the losing teams' hands. In some rules the pip count of the remaining stock is added. If a game is blocked because no player can move, the winner can often be determined by counting the pips in all players' hands.<ref name="kelleylugo2003" />

In ''scoring games'' each individual move potentially adds to the score. E.g. in [[Bergen (domino game)|Bergen]], players score 2 points whenever they cause a configuration in which both open ends have the same value and 3 points if additionally one open end is formed by a double.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bergen|publisher=domino-games.com|url=http://www.domino-games.com/domino-rules/bergen-rules.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bergen|publisher=pagat.com|url=http://www.pagat.com/tile/wdom/bergen.html}}</ref> In [[Muggins (domino game)|Muggins]], players score by ensuring that the total pip count of the open ends is a multiple of a certain number. In variants of Muggins the line of play may branch due to spinners.

In British public houses and social clubs the scoring version of "fives and threes" is used. Score is kept on a cribbage board and the objective is to score 61 points. The points are scored by making totals at the ends of the lines that are divisible by five and three, thus a score of 15 (say double five at one end and a single five at the other) scores a total of eight points (five threes and three fives). If at the end game your score is more than the points remaining you cannot peg out and must wait to score lower (for example if you have 54 and you score 8 points you cannot peg that, so you must wait for the opportunity to score fewer points). This is played in a number of competitive leagues in the British Isles.

===Minor details===
{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}
In many versions of the game, the player with the highest double leads with that double, for example "double six". If no one has it the next highest double is called - "double five?", then "double four?", etc. until the highest double in any of the players hands is played. If no player has an "opening" double, the next heaviest domino in the highest suit is called - "six - five?", "six - four?". In some variants the players take turns picking dominoes from the stock until an opening double is picked and played; in other variants the hand is reshuffled and each player picks seven dominoes. After the first hand, the winner ''or winning team'' of the previous hand is allowed to pick their dominoes first, and begins by playing any domino in his or her hand. 

Playing the first bone of a hand is sometimes called ''setting'', ''leading'', ''downing'', or ''posing'' the first bone. Dominoes aficionados often call this procedure ''smacking the bone down''. After each hand the bones are shuffled, and each player draws the number of bones required (7). Play generally proceeds "clockwise". The next player, and all players in turn, must play a bone with an end that matches one of the open ends of the layouts. In some versions of the games, the pips or points on the end, and the section to be played next to it must add up to a given number; [For example in a double six set the "sum" would be six, requiring a "blank" to be played next to a "6," a "1" next to a "5", a "2" next to a "4", etc.]

The stock of bones left behind, if any, is called the ''bone yard'', and the bones therein are said to be ''sleeping''. In draw games, players take part in the ''bone selection'', typically drawing from the bone yard when they don't have a "match" in their hand.

Generally, if a player inadvertently picks up and sees one or more extra dominoes, those dominoes becomes part of his or her hand.

A player who can play a tile may or may not be allowed to pass anyway. Passing can be signalled by tapping twice on the table or by saying "go" or "pass".

Play continues until one of the players has played all the dominoes in his or her hand, (and calls "out!", "I win", or "domino!") and wins the hand, or until all the players are blocked and no legal plays are left. This is in some areas referred to as a ''lockdown'' or "sewed up". In a common version of the game, the next player after the block, picks up all the dominoes in the bone yard, as if trying to find the (non-existent) match. If all the players are blocked, or ''locked out'' the player with the lowest hand / pip count wins. In team play, the team with the lowest individual hand wins. In the case of a tie, the first of tied players or the first ''team'' in the play rotation wins.

In games where points are accrued, the winning player scores a point for each pip on each bone still held by each opponent, or the opposing team. If no player went out, however, the win is determined by the lightest hand;  sometimes only the excess points held by opponents. A game is generally played to 100 points, the tally being kept with [[paper]] and [[pencil]]. In more common games, mainly urban rules, games are played to 150, 200, or 250 points. In some games the tally is kept by creating '''houses''', where the beginning of the house (the first ten points) is a large [[+]], the next ten points are [[O]], and scoring with a 5 is a [[/]], and are placed in the four 'corners' of the '''house'''. In some versions, if a ''lockdown'' occurs then the first person to call the lockdown will gain the other players bones and add the amount of the pips to their house. Also, the first person to call ''rocks'' if they believe or know the person that called "domino" or "lockdown" miscounted the pips will count the pips themselves; if the person that called ''rocks'' finds that the number of pips the player called is different, the points become his after proving that he is correct in his counting.

===Games using more dominoes===
With bigger domino sets, especially with the Double Fifteens and Double Eighteens, it is possible to have more players. Double 9s is good for 4 to 6 players and each player would start with 10 dominoes in their hand. Double 12s, 15s, and 18s are good for up to 10 to 15 players, each with 7 dominoes. If you have fewer players and more dominoes, start with more dominoes in each player's hand, but leave enough dominoes in the bone pile to draw from. When using the larger sets, make sure you have plenty of playing room as they can spread out considerably.

Double 6s = 7 rounds, double 9s = 10 rounds, double 12s = 13 rounds, double 15s = 16 rounds, double 18s = 19 rounds.

===Card games using domino sets===
Apart from the usual blocking and scoring games, there are also domino of games of a very different character, such as solitaire or trick-taking games. Most of these are adaptations of [[card game]]s and were once popular in certain areas to circumvent religious prescriptions against [[playing card]]s.<ref>{{Cite book

A very simple example is a [[Concentration (game)|Concentration]] variant played with a double-six set; two tiles are considered to match if their total pip count is 12.

A popular domino game in [[Texas]] is [[42 (dominoes)|42]]. The game is similar to the card game [[spades]]. It is played with four players paired into teams. Each player draws seven dominoes, and the dominoes are played into tricks. Each trick counts as 1 point, and any domino with a multiple of 5 dots counts toward the total of the hand. 35 points of "five count" + 7 tricks = 42 points, hence the name.<!---

The following seems to be just a slightly spiced up standard variant of the 4 player Block game with empty stock.Part of this information may be worth including elsewhere, but it doesn't really belong into an "other games" section.

Also, in the Caribbean, there are other common games which involve four players in which the players can play as partners or as individuals. In partners, the partners sit across from each other and all hands can not be seen by the other players. The game is started by shuffling the dominoes or 'cards' and each player pulling seven cards. The double six is then played and play continues to the starter's right side. If a player can not play then he is passed and it is the next player's turn. The object is for a team to win by one of the players running out of dominoes. The winning team is awarded a point and then restart the process by shuffling and pulling a new hand and then starting with any domino either partner wishes to play. The game goes on till one team reaches six points. Double points are awarded when you get 'key'. This happens when your last card is the only card that can be played on both ends. Also when a player pulls five doubles all players put their dominoes back and pull new hands, the following game is played for 2 points and the double six is started by the player who has it. This variation is called Partners, where the other variation is called Cut-Throat, where each player plays for himself, in which all the same rules apply as in partners. This form of dominoes is most common in [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]].

==Competitive play==
Dominoes is played at a professional level, similar to poker. Numerous organisations and clubs of amateur domino players exist around the world{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Some organisations, including the [[International Federation of Dominos]] and the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Domino]] (FIDO), organise international competitions. The 2008 and 2009 Double FIDO domino world champion from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is [[Darren Elhindi]].

==Other uses of dominoes==
[[Image:Domino Cascade.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Dominoes in motion.]]
[[Image:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dominoes waiting to fall]]
Besides playing games, another use of dominoes is standing them on end in long lines so that when the first tile is toppled, it topples the second, which topples the third, etc., resulting in all of the tiles falling. For large and elaborate arrangements, special blockages are employed at regular distances to prevent a premature toppling from undoing more than a section of the dominoes while still being able to be removed without damage.

Arrangements of millions of tiles have been made that have taken many minutes to fall. By analogy, the phenomenon of small events causing similar events leading to eventual catastrophe is called the [[domino effect]]. The phenomenon also has some theoretical relevance ([[amplifier]], [[digital signal]], [[information processing]]),<ref name=domcom>[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1764437 Domino computer]</ref> and this amounts to the theoretical possibility of building [[domino computer]]s.<ref name=comdomcon>[http://www.pinkandaint.com/oldhome/comp/dominoes/index.html Domino computers], a detailed description written by [http://www.pinkandaint.com/ David Johnston]</ref> Dominoes are also commonly used as components in [[Rube Goldberg machine]]s.

The [[Netherlands]] has hosted an annual domino toppling exhibition called [[Domino Day]] since 1986. The event held on November 18, 2005 knocked over 4 million dominoes by a team from [[Weijers Domino Productions]]. On Domino Day 2008 (November 14, 2008), the Weijers Domino Productions team attempted to set 10 records:<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7730834.stm |title=World domino record set on TV |accessdate=18 November 2008|work=BBC News | date=15 November 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://dominofans.ning.com/page/domino-day-2008-1 Domino Day documentation on DominoFans.com]</ref>

This record attempt was held in the [[WTC Expo]] hall in [[Leeuwarden]]. The artist who toppled the first stone was the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[acrobatics|acrobat]] [[Salima Peippo]].

At one time, [[Pressman Toy Corp.|Pressman Toys]] manufactured a product called [[Domino Rally]] that contained tiles and mechanical devices for setting up toppling exhibits.

In [[Berlin]] on November 9, 2009, giant dominoes were toppled in a 20th anniversary commemoration of the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]]. Former Polish president and [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]] set the toppling in motion.

A similar physical phenomenon can be seen in [[Newton's cradle]].

==Dominoes in Unicode==
Since April 2008,<ref>{{cite press|date=April 4, 2008|publisher=Unicode Consortium|url=http://www.unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html |title=Unicode Version 5.1 Released}}</ref> the universal text encoding standard [[Unicode]] includes characters that represent the double-six domino tiles in various orientations (all combinations of 0 through 6 pips on the left or right provides 7x7 or 49 glyphs, the same combinations vertically for another 49, and also a horizontal and a vertical "back" for a total of 100 glyphs). The Unicode range for dominoes is U+1F030 .. U+1F09F. (Grey areas in the table below indicate non-assigned code points.) However, few fonts [http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/domino_tiles/fontsupport.htm] are known to support these glyphs.
