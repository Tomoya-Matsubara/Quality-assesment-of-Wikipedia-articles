{{Music of Final Fantasy}}
The '''music of the video game ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''''' was composed by [[Noriko Matsueda]] and [[Takahito Eguchi]]. Regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] did not contribute any of the music, despite having composed the majority of the soundtrack for the prequel, ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''. The ''Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack'' was released on two [[Compact Disc]]s in 2003 by [[Avex]]. After the release of ''Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission'', an album entitled ''Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack'' composed of the songs added to the soundtrack for that game was released in 2003 by Avex. ''Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection'', a collection of [[piano]] arrangements of the original soundtracks by Noriko Matsueda, Takahito Eguchi, Hiroko Kokubu, Masahiro Sayama, and Febian Reza Pane, was released by Avex in [[2004]]. 

A [[single (music)|single]] by [[Kumi Koda]] entitled ''real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba'', based on the theme song for the game and the ending credits song, was published by [[Rhythm Zone]] prior to the game's release in 2003. Another single, titled ''Eternity ~Memories of Waves and Light~ Music from Final Fantasy X-2'', was released by Avex in 2003 along with the original soundtrack. It consisted of live arrangements of several of the game's songs, composed and arranged by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. A set of three singles entitled ''Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collection- Paine'', ''Rikku'', and ''Yuna'' was published by Avex in 2003, with each single including vocal arrangements of songs from the game, sung by the respective character's voice actress.

The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics; while several felt that the music was good and keeping in tone with the game, others found it to be odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change to the lack of participation by Uematsu. ''Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack'' and ''Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection'', on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who found a few of the songs to be enjoyable but all of the singles to be overpriced.

== Concept and creation ==
''Final Fantasy X-2'' marks the first soundtrack where former [[Square Co.|Square]] composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] did not contribute a single piece, despite having composed the majority of the [[Music of Final Fantasy X|soundtrack for the prequel]], ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', as he was already busy with other projects.<ref name="igndeveloperinterview">{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 Developer Interview | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref> None of the pieces from the ''Final Fantasy X'' soundtrack were re-used in ''X-2''. [[Noriko Matsueda]] and [[Takahito Eguchi]] were brought onboard to compose the music for the game, as the developers felt they were the "perfect fit" to incorporate a "pop" style into the music.<ref name="igndeveloperinterview"/> The game includes two songs with vocalized elements, one of which, the [[J-Pop]] song "real Emotion", was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara. The other, [[J-Pop]] [[ballad]] "1000 Words", was written by scenario writers [[Kazushige Nojima]] and [[Daisuke Watanabe]]. Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track. Both songs were sung by [[Jade Villalon]] from [[Sweetbox]] in the [[English language|English]] version of the game, and are available as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album [[Adagio (album)|Adagio]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Miscellaneous Final Fantasy CDs | url=http://ffmusic.info/ffcdmisc.html | publisher=ffmusic.info | accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> In the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version of the game both the songs were sung by [[Koda Kumi]], and were released as a single entitled ''real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba''. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single ''[[Come with Me (Kumi Koda song)|Come with Me]]'', with slightly different versions of the lyrics than Jade. The composers also sampled a cue, ''"Titus' Vow"'' from [[Elliot Goldenthal]]'s score for ''Titus'' for the track ''Zanarkand Ruins'' both of which can be heard at the Titus score page [[Titus (soundtrack)#Final Fantasy X-2 sample|here]]. Elliot Goldenthal also composed the score for [[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within#Soundtrack|Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Kumi Koda - Come With Me | url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ffx-2-koda-cwm/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

''real Emotion/1000 Words'' was poorly received by critics, with Patrick Gann declaring himself to be "not too impressed".<ref name="RPGFRE1000"/> He was more receptive to ''Eternity ~Memories of Waves and Light~ Music from Final Fantasy X-2'', feeling that the tracks were three of the best tracks from the soundtrack, and that the single was worth purchasing if only because it was the only release of arranged music from the game to date.  However, he felt that for the length, the single was overpriced.<ref name="RPGFETER"/> Chris of Square Enix Music Online also felt the single was overpriced, but additionally felt that the arrangements were "unremarkable musically" and that the album as a whole was "a cheap production."<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris | title=Eternity ~Memory of the Lightwaves~ Music from FFX-2: Review by Chris | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/ff10-2eternity.shtml | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>  The ''Final Fantasy Vocal Collection'' singles received mixed reviews, with Patrick Gann praising ''Paine'' as "sophisticated" and applauding the instrumentation, while also approving of ''Yuna'', terming it "peaceful" and the best of the three.<ref name="RPGFVOCALP"/><ref name="RPGFVOCALY"/> However, he also derided ''Rikku'' as "cheesy" and disliked the lyrics of one of the two tracks from ''Paine''.<ref name="RPGFVOCALR"/>  Additionally, he overall found the singles to be very overpriced for the small amount of material included. Selections of music from the game have appeared on Japanese remix albums, called [[dojin music]], and on English remixing websites.<ref>{{cite web | title=Game: Final Fantasy X-2 (2003, Square Enix, PS2) | url= http://www.ocremix.org/game/final-fantasy-x-2-ps2/ | publisher=[[OverClocked ReMix]] | accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>
