{{Saffir-Simpson}}
The '''Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale''' ('''SSHWS'''), or the '''Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane scale''' ('''SSHS''') for short, classifies [[hurricanes]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Western Hemisphere]] [[tropical cyclone]]s that exceed the intensities of [[tropical depression]]s and [[tropical storm]]s{{spaced ndash}}into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained [[wind]]s. To be classified as a hurricane, a [[tropical cyclone]] must have [[maximum sustained wind]]s of at least {{convert|74|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on|lk=out}} (Category 1). The highest classification in the scale, [[#Category 5|Category&nbsp;5]], is reserved for storms with winds exceeding {{convert|156|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on}}.

The classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and [[flood]]ing a hurricane will cause upon [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]].

Officially, the Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale is used ''only'' to describe [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Pacific hurricane|northern Pacific Ocean]] east of the [[International Date Line]]. Other areas use [[Tropical cyclone scales|different scales]] to label these storms, which are called "cyclones" or "typhoons", depending on the area.

There is some [[#Criticism|criticism]] of the SSHS for not taking rain, storm speed, and other important factors into consideration, but SSHS defenders say that part of the goal of SSHS is to be straightforward and simple to understand.

== History ==
The scale was developed in 1971 by [[Civil engineering|civil engineer]] [[Herbert Saffir]] and meteorologist [[Robert Simpson (meteorologist)|Bob (Robert) Simpson]], who at the time was director of the U.S. [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC).<ref name="USA Today">{{cite news|author = Williams, Jack | title = Hurricane scale invented to communicate storm danger | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = May 17, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-02-25 | url= http://www.usatoday.com/weather/hurricane/whscale.htm}}</ref> The scale was introduced to the general public in 1973,<ref name="Bridgeport Post">{{cite news | url = http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=82937522_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=9&currentPage=50 | title = '73 Hurricanes to be Graded | author = Staff writer | agency = Associated Press | date = May 9, 1973 | accessdate = 2007-12-08}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and saw widespread use after [[Neil Frank]] replaced Simpson at the helm of the NHC in 1974.<ref name="Simpson interview"/>

The initial scale was developed by Saffir, a [[Structural engineering|structural engineer]], who in 1969 went on commission for the [[United Nations]] to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=2001-08-13|title=Hurricanes shaped life of scale inventor Saffir|accessdate=2007-12-21|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=11989664_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring the utility of the [[Richter magnitude scale]] in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1<U+2013>5 scale based on [[wind speed]] that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of [[storm surge]] and flooding.

In 2009, the NHC made moves to eliminate pressure and storm surge ranges from the categories, transforming it into a pure wind scale, called the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (Experimental) [SSHWS].<ref name="NHC SSHS">[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ''National Hurricane Center''. Accessed 2009-05-15.]</ref> The new scale became operational on May 15, 2010.<ref>[http://www.ofcm.gov/nhop/10/pdf/2010%20NHOP%20entire%20document.pdf National Hurricane Operations Plan] ''[[NOAA]]''. Accessed 2010-07-03.</ref> The scale excludes flood ranges, storm surge estimations, [[rainfall]], and location, which means a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane which hits a major city will likely do far more cumulative damage than a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane that hits a rural area.<ref name="LiveScience"/> The agency cited various hurricanes as reasons for removing the "scientifically inaccurate" information, including [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005) and [[Hurricane Ike]] (2008), which both had stronger than estimated storm surges, and [[Hurricane Charley]] (2004), which had weaker than estimated storm surge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov/infoservicechanges/sshws.pdf |title=Experimental Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale |year=2009 |publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref> 

In 2012, the NHC expanded the windspeed range for Category 4 by 1&nbsp;mph in both directions, to 130<U+2013>156&nbsp;mph, with corresponding changes in the other units (113<U+2013>136 kn, 209<U+2013>251&nbsp;km/h), instead of 131<U+2013>155&nbsp;mph (114<U+2013>135 kn, 210<U+2013>249&nbsp;km/h). The NHC and the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3&nbsp;mph) would round down to 130&nbsp;mph, making it appear to be a Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155&nbsp;mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02&nbsp;km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135&nbsp;mph, and 135 kn as 245&nbsp;km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130&nbsp;mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250&nbsp;km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years.<ref name="NHC SSHS" /> The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/news/20120301_pis_sshws.php Public Information Statement] ''[[NOAA]]''. Accessed 2012-03-09.</ref>

== Categories ==
The scale separates hurricanes into five different categories based on wind. The U.S. National Hurricane Center classifies hurricanes of Category&nbsp;3 and above as ''major hurricanes'', and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center classifies typhoons of Category 4 and 5 as ''super typhoons'' (although all hurricanes can be very dangerous). Most weather agencies use the definition for sustained winds recommended by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO), which specifies measuring winds at a height of {{convert|33|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} for 10&nbsp;minutes, and then taking the average. By contrast, the U.S. [[National Weather Service]], [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] and the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] defines sustained winds as average winds over a period of one minute, measured at the same {{convert|33|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} height.<ref name="NWSM Defs">{{cite web | author = Tropical Cyclone Weather Services Program | title = Tropical cyclone definitions | url = http://www.weather.gov/directives/sym/pd01006004curr.pdf | format = PDF | date = June 1, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-30 | publisher = National Weather Service}}</ref><ref name="FEMA glossary">{{cite web | author=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] | title = Hurricane Glossary of Terms | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2006-03-24 | url = http://www.fema.gov/hazards/hurricanes/hurglos.shtm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051214034332/http://www.fema.gov/hazards/hurricanes/hurglos.shtm |archivedate = 2005-12-14}} Accessed through the [[Internet Archive|Wayback Machine]].</ref> [[Atmospheric pressure|Central pressure]] and storm surge values are approximate and often dependant on other factors, such as the size of the storm and the location. Intensity of example hurricanes is from both the time of landfall and the maximum intensity. As a result, it is not uncommon for a pressure to be significantly higher or lower than expected for a specific category. Generally, large storms with very large radii of maximum winds have the lowest pressures relative to its intensity.<ref name="NHC SSHS" />

The scale is roughly logarithmic in wind speed, and the top wind speed for Category "''c''" (''c''=1 to 4) can be expressed as 83x10^(c/15) miles per hour rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 <U+2013> except that after the change mentioned above, Category 4 is now widened by 1&nbsp;mph in each direction.

The five categories are, in order of increasing intensity:

'''''Very dangerous winds will produce some damage'''''

Category&nbsp;1 storms usually cause no significant structural [[property damage|damage]] to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored [[mobile home]]s, as well as uproot or snap numerous trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and [[pier]] damage are often associated with Category&nbsp;1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it is the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.<ref name="NHC SSHS"/>

Examples of storms which made landfall at this intensity include [[Hurricane Danny (1985)|Danny]] (1985), [[Hurricane Jerry (1989)|Jerry]] (1989), [[Hurricane Hernan (1996)|Hernan]] (1996), [[Hurricane Claudette (2003)|Claudette]] (2003), [[Hurricane Gaston (2004)|Gaston]] (2004), [[Hurricane Humberto (2007)|Humberto]] (2007), [[Hurricane Shary (2010)|Shary]] (2010), and [[Hurricane Barbara (2013)|Barbara]] (2013).

'''''Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage'''''

Storms of Category&nbsp;2 intensity often damage roofing material (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many [[Manufactured housing|manufactured homes]] also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]]s. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.<ref name="NHC SSHS"/>

Hurricanes that peaked at Category&nbsp;2 intensity, and made landfall at that intensity, include [[Hurricane Diana|Diana]] (1990), [[Hurricane Erin (1995)|Erin]] (1995), [[Hurricane Alma (1996)|Alma]] (1996), and [[Hurricane Ernesto (2012)|Ernesto]] (2012).

'''''Devastating damage will occur'''''

Tropical cyclones of Category 3 and higher are described as [[Tropical cyclone#Classifications, terminology, and naming|major hurricanes]] in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific [[Tropical cyclone basins|basins]]. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor [[curtainwall]] failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and [[gable]]-end roofs are peeled off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by [[buoyancy|float]]ing debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, [[terrain]] may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.<ref name="NHC SSHS"/>

Examples of landfalling storms of this intensity include [[Hurricane Carol|Carol]] (1954), [[Hurricane Alma (1966)|Alma]] (1966), [[Hurricane Celia|Celia]] (1970), [[Hurricane Alicia|Alicia]] (1983), [[Hurricane Roxanne|Roxanne]] (1995), [[Hurricane Fran|Fran]] (1996), [[Hurricane Isidore|Isidore]] (2002), [[Hurricane Lane (2006)|Lane]] (2006), [[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Irene]] (2011), [[Hurricane Sandy (2012)|Sandy]] (2012).

'''''Catastrophic damage will occur'''''

Category&nbsp;4 hurricanes tend to produce more extensive curtainwall failures, with some complete [[structural failure]] on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.<ref name="NHC SSHS"/>

The [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], the deadliest natural disaster to hit the [[United States]], peaked at an intensity that corresponds to a modern-day Category&nbsp;4 storm. Other examples of storms making landfall at this intensity include [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] (1954), [[Hurricane Audrey|Audrey]] (1957), [[Hurricane Flora|Flora]] (1963), [[Hurricane Cleo|Cleo]] (1964), [[Hurricane Frederic|Frederic]] (1979), [[Hurricane Joan|Joan]] (1988), [[Hurricane Iniki|Iniki]] (1992), [[Hurricane Luis|Luis]] (1995), [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]] (2004), and [[Hurricane Dennis|Dennis]] (2005).

'''''Catastrophic damage will occur'''''

Category&nbsp;5 is the highest category a tropical cyclone can obtain in the Saffir&ndash;Simpson scale. These storms cause complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings, and some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. Collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls, especially those with no interior supports, is common. Very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood frame structures and total destruction to mobile/manufactured homes is prevalent. Only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact, and only if located at least {{convert|3|to|5|mi|km|0}} inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or steel frame construction, public multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or [[concrete]]/[[cement]] block and have [[hip roof|hipped roof]]s with slopes of no less than 35&nbsp;degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters. Unless all of these requirements are met, the absolute destruction of a structure is certain.<ref name="NHC SSHS"/>

The storm's flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline, and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked, isolating most communities impacted. Massive [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas. Total and extremely long-lived extensive power outages and water losses are to be expected, possibly for up to several months.<ref name="NHC SSHS"/>

Historical examples of storms that made landfall at Category 5 status include the [[1959 Mexico Hurricane]], [[Hurricane Camille|Camille (1969)]], [[Hurricane Anita|Anita (1977)]], [[Hurricane David|David (1979)]], [[Hurricane Gilbert|Gilbert (1988)]], [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew (1992)]], [[Hurricane Dean|Dean (2007)]] and [[Hurricane Felix|Felix (2007)]].

==Criticism==
Some scientists, including [[Kerry Emanuel]] and Lakshmi Kantha, have criticized the scale as being simplistic, indicating that the scale does not take into account the physical size of a storm, nor the amount of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] it produces.<ref name="LiveScience"/> Additionally, they and others point out that the Saffir&ndash;Simpson scale, unlike the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]] into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the [[dynamic pressure]] caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which bases itself on surface wind speeds, the [[radius of maximum wind]]s of the storm, and its [[Translation (geometry)|translational]] velocity.<ref name="Kantha HHI HII">{{cite journal | author = Kantha, L. | url = http://www.ametro.net/~spongey/images/2006EO010003.pdf | month = January | year = 2006 | title = Time to Replace the Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale? | journal = [[Eos (journal)|Eos]] | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | format = PDF | pages = 3, 6 | accessdate = 2007-12-08}}</ref><ref name="Kantha BAMS">{{cite journal|last=Kantha|first=Lakshmi|month=February | year=2008|title=Tropical Cyclone Destructive Potential by Integrated Kinetic Energy|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]]|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|location=Boston|volume=89|issue=2|pages=219<U+2013>221|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-89-2-219|format=PDF |doi=10.1175/BAMS-89-2-219|bibcode = 2008BAMS...89..219K }}</ref> Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale;<ref name="UCL alternates">{{cite web | author = Benfield Hazard Research Centre | publisher = [[University College London]] | title = Atmospheric Hazards | work = Hazard & Risk Science Review 2006 | url = http://www.benfieldhrc.org/activities/hrsr/h&rsr_2006/atmospheric.htm | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-12-08}}</ref> however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.

===Category 6===
After the series of powerful storm systems of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], a few newspaper columnists and scientists brought up the suggestion of introducing Category&nbsp;6, and they have suggested pegging Category&nbsp;6 to storms with winds greater than {{convert|174|or|180|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="LiveScience">{{cite news|author = Ker Than|title = Wilma's Rage Suggests New Hurricane Categories Needed|publisher = [[LiveScience]]|date = 2005-10-20|url = http://www.livescience.com/environment/051020_hurricane_winds.html|accessdate = 2005-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author = Bill Blakemore|title = Category 6 Hurricanes?

Of the 35 hurricanes currently considered to have attained Category 5 level in the Atlantic, only 17 had wind speeds greater than {{convert|175|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on}} and only eight had wind speeds greater than {{convert|180|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on}}. Of the 14 hurricanes currently considered to have attained Category 5 level in the eastern Pacific, only four had wind speeds greater than {{convert|175|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on}}, and only one had a wind speed at {{convert|180|mph|m/s kn km/h|abbr=on}}. However, most storms which would be eligible for this category were from the western Pacific and are referred to as [[typhoon#Intensity_classifications|super typhoon]]s, most notably [[Typhoon Ida (1958)|Typhoon Ida]] in 1958 and [[Typhoon Nancy (1961)|Typhoon Nancy]] in 1961, both with sustained winds of {{convert|215|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and [[Typhoon Tip]] in 1979 with sustained winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |author=Debi Iacovelli and Tim Vasquez |year=1998 |title=Supertyphoon Tip: Shattering all records |work=Monthly Weather Log |accessdate=2010-09-19 |url=http://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/aug1998.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref>

According to [[Robert Simpson (meteorologist)|Robert Simpson]], there are no reasons for a Category&nbsp;6 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale because it is designed to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to manmade structures. Stating that "...when you get up into winds in excess of {{convert|155|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it's going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered".<ref name="Simpson interview">{{cite web|author = Debi Iacovelli|title = The Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Scale: An Interview with Dr. Robert Simpson|work = [[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=Fort Lauderdale, Fla. |month = July | year = 2001|url = http://www.novalynx.com/simpson-interview.html |accessdate = 2006-09-10}}</ref>
