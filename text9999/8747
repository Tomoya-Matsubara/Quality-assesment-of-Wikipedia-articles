'''''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''''' is a [[1977 in film|1977]] [[science fiction film]] directed and written by [[Steven Spielberg]]. The film stars [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]], [[Melinda Dillon]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Bob Balaban]] and [[Cary Guffey]]. ''Close Encounters'' tells the story of Roy Neary, an [[Indiana]] [[lineman (occupation)|electrical lineman]], and his encounter and obsessions with [[unidentified flying object]]s. The plot further develops due to the presence of the [[federal government of the United States]] and their scientific researchers.

''Close Encounters'' was a long-cherished project that had been enshrined since Spielberg's childhood. In late-1973, he developed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures]] for a science fiction film. [[Paul Schrader]], [[John Hill (screenwriter)|John Hill]], [[David Giler]], [[Hal Barwood]], [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]] and [[Jerry Belson]] contributed with script writing work, alongside Spielberg. In the end Spielberg was given solo writing credit. 

Filming began in May 1976, where problems occurred such as the film's production budget, [[tropical cyclone]]s and the [[shooting schedule]]. [[Douglas Trumbull]] served as the [[visual effects supervisor]], while [[Carlo Rambaldi]] designed the aliens. ''Close Encounters'' was released with financial and critical success. The film was [[reissue]]d in 1980 as ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition''. The film received numerous awards and nominations at the [[50th Academy Awards]], [[32nd British Academy Film Awards]], the [[Saturn Award]]s and has been widely acclaimed by the [[American Film Institute]]. ''Close Encounters'' has also led to the development of the unproduced film ''[[Night Skies]]''.

==Plot==
In the [[Sonoran Desert]], Claude Lacombe ([[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]]) and David Laughlin ([[Bob Balaban]]), along with other government scientific researchers discover a [[Flight 19|lost squadron]] of [[World War II]] [[aircraft]]. The aircraft  are still and intact and perfectly operational, but the pilots have disappeared. In [[Air Traffic Control]] [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], two flights have a [[near miss (safety)|near miss]] with a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]. In [[Muncie, Indiana]], three year-old Barry Guiler ([[Cary Guffey]]) is led out of his house when his toys start operating automatically, forcing his mother Gillian ([[Melinda Dillon]]) to chase after him. During a large-scale [[power outage]], [[Indiana]] [[lineman (occupation)|electrical lineman]] Roy Neary ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) experiences a [[close encounter#Second kind|close encounter of the second kind]], and is soon caught in a motorized pursuit of four UFOs. He becomes obsessed with UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Veronica "Ronnie" Neary ([[Teri Garr]]).

Roy begins seeing the image and soon begins making [[scale model]]s of a distinctive [[butte]], a place he has never seen and is unfamiliar with. Gillian also becomes obsessed with the mental picture of a unique-looking mountain.  Soon after, Gillian witnesses a UFO landing, in which  Barry is abducted by unseen beings. After Roy's increasingly [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric behavior]] causes Ronnie to abandon him, taking their three children with her, he sees the feature he has been modeling on a television news show: [[Devils Tower National Monument]] in [[Wyoming]]. Guiler also sees the same news broadcast, and both Roy and Jillian, as well as others with similar experiences, obsessively head toward the site. Elsewhere in the world, the pace of UFO activity is increasing; Lacombe and Laughlin investigate a host of occurrences along with other [[United Nations]] experts. Eyewitnesses report the UFOs to make distinctive sounds: a five-tone motif.

After Laughlin recognizes a signal from [[outer space]] as a set of geographical coordinates pointing to Devils Tower, all parties begin to converge on Wyoming. The [[United States Army]] evacuates the area, using false reports that a train wreck has spilled highly dangerous [[nerve gas]], all the while preparing a landing zone for the first human contact with the UFOs and their occupants. While the other humans drawn to the site are unable to reach Devils Tower, Roy and Jillian persist and make it to the site as dozens of UFOs appear. The enormous [[mother ship]] lands, returning people who had been [[alien abduction|abducted]] over the years, including Barry. With an understanding of peace between the two civilizations, Roy is taken onboard the ship as an ambassador from Earth, and one of the UFO occupants comes out to greet the humans. Lacombe communicates with it by using the hand signs that are used to create the five tones in the human contact. The UFO occupant does the same and smiles before it boards back on the ship, which then lifts off.

==Cast==
*'''[[Richard Dreyfuss]]''' as '''Roy Neary''': A [[Indiana]] [[lineman (occupation)|electrical lineman]] who encounters and forms an obsession with [[unidentified flying object]]s. [[Steve McQueen]] was Spielberg's first choice. Although McQueen was impressed with the script, he felt was not specifically right for the role. [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Al Pacino]] and [[Gene Hackman]] turned down the part as well.<ref name=making>[[Steven Spielberg]], [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Joe Alves]], [[Melinda Dillon]], [[Douglas Trumbull]], ''The Making of Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', 2001, [[Columbia Pictures]]</ref> [[Jack Nicholson]] turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. Spielberg explained when filming ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' "Dreyfuss talked me into casting him. He listened to about 155-days worth of ''Close Encounters''. He even contributed ideas."<ref name=Dreyfuss>McBride, p.260&mdash;269</ref> Dreyfuss reflected, "I launched myself into a campaign to get the part. I would walk by Steve's office and say stuff like 'Al Pacino has no sense of humor' or 'Jack Nicholson is too crazy'. I eventually convinced him to cast me."<ref name=making/>
*'''[[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]]''' as '''Claude Lacombe''': A French government scientist in charge of UFO-related activities in the United States. [[G<U+00E9>rard Depardieu]], [[Philippe Noiret]], [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] and [[Lino Ventura]] were considered for the role. During filming, Truffaut used his [[leisure]] to write the script for ''[[The Man Who Loved Women (1977 film)|The Man Who Loved Women]]''. He also worked on a novel titled ''The Actor'', a project he abandoned.<ref name=actor>McBride, p.280&mdash;289</ref>
*'''[[Melinda Dillon]]''' as '''Gillian Guiler''': Barry's [[single parent|single mother]]. She also forms a similar obsession with Roy, and the two become friends. Teri Garr wanted to portray Gillian, but ended being cast as Ronnie. [[Hal Ashby]], who worked with Dillon on ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'', suggested her for the part to Spielberg. Dillon was cast three days before filming began.<ref name=making/> 
*'''[[Teri Garr]]''' as '''Veronica "Ronnie" Neary''': Roy's wife. She attempts to hide the sunburn caused by Roy's exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. [[Amy Irving]] auditioned for the role.<ref name=Amy>McBride, p.290&mdash;294</ref>
*'''[[Bob Balaban]]''' as '''David Laughlin''':  Lacombe's assistant and English-French translator. They meet for the first time in the [[Sonoran Desert]] at the beginning of the film.
*'''[[Cary Guffey]]''' as '''Barry Guiler''': Melinda's young child abducted in the middle of the film. Spielberg conducted a series of [[method acting]] techniques to help Guffey, who was three years old.<ref name=making/>

[[J. Allen Hynek]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] at the closing scene. Spielberg's friends [[Hal Barwood]] and [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]] also cameo as two [[World War II]] pilots returning in the end.

==Production==
===Development===
The genesis of ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' started when [[Steven Spielberg]], as a young boy, and his father saw a [[meteor shower]] in [[New Jersey]].<ref name=making/> As a teenager, Spielberg completed the full-length [[science fiction film]] ''[[Firelight (1964 film)|Firelight]]''. Many scenes from ''Firelight'' would be incorporated in ''Close Encounters'' on a [[shot-for-shot]] basis.<ref name=Fire>McBride, p.14&mdash;68</ref> In 1970 he wrote a [[short story]] called ''Experiences'' about a [[lover's lane]] [[Midwestern United States]] farming community and a "light show" a group of teenagers see in the night sky.<ref name=state/> In late-1973, during [[post-production]] on ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', Spielberg developed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures]] for a science fiction film. [[20th Century Fox]] previously turned down the offer.<ref name=state/> [[Julia Phillips|Julia]] and [[Michael Phillips]] instantly signed on as producers.<ref>{{cite news | author = David Helpern | title = At Sea with Steven Spielberg | work = [[Take One]] | pages=47&mdash;53 | date = March 1974 | accessdate = 2008-09-15}}</ref>

He first considered doing a documentary about people who believed in [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]'s, or a low-budget feature film. Spielberg decided "a film that depended on [[state of the art]] technology couldn't be made for $2.5 million."<ref name=state>McBride, p.227&mdash;229</ref> Borrowing a phrase from the ending of ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', he retitled the film ''Watch the Skies'', rewriting the premise concerning [[Project Blue Book]] and [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]ing the concept to [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]]. Katz remembered "It had [[flying saucer]]s from outer space landing on [[Robertson Boulevard]] [in [[West Hollywood, California]]]. I go, 'Steve, that's the worst idea I ever heard."<ref name=state/> Spielberg brought [[Paul Schrader]] to write the script in December 1973 with [[principal photography]] to begin in late-1974. Spielberg went to work on ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', pushing ''Watch the Skies'' back.<ref name=state/> 

With the financial and critical success of ''Jaws'', Spielberg earned a vast amount of creative control from Columbia, declaring the right to make the film any way he wanted.<ref name=come/> Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, "one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned into a [[major film studio]] or director. It was a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all."<ref name=Dreyfuss/> Titled ''Kingdom Come'', the script's [[protagonist]] was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. "[His] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." Schrader continued. "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15-years trying to make contact."<ref name=Dreyfuss/> Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring [[John Hill (screenwriter)|John Hill]] to rewrite.<ref name=Dreyfuss/> At one point the main character was a [[police officer]].<ref name=making/> Spielberg "[found] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to have Mr. Everyday Regular Fella." Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during [[post-production]] on ''Jaws''.<ref name=Dreyfuss/> He reflected, "they wanted to make it like a [[James Bond]] adventure."<ref name=mind/>

[[David Giler]] performed a rewrite. [[Hal Barwood]] and [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]], friends of Spielberg, suggested the [[plot device]] of a kidnapped child. Spielberg then began to write the script. The song "[[When You Wish upon a Star]]" from ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' highly influenced Spielberg's writing style. "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally."<ref name=Dreyfuss/> [[Jerry Belson]] and Spielberg wrote the [[shooting script]] together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit.<ref name=Dreyfuss/> During [[pre-production]], the title was changed from ''Kingdom Come'' to ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''.<ref name=come>McBride, p.270&mdash;279</ref> [[J. Allen Hynek]], who worked with the [[United States Air Force]] on Project Blue Book, was hired as a scientific consultant. Hynek feels "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] after ''Jaws'', but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line."<ref name=Dreyfuss/> The US Air Force and [[NASA]] refused to cooperate on the film.<ref name=come/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on May 16, 1976. Spielberg did not want to do any [[location shooting]] because of his negative experience on ''Jaws'' and wanted to shoot ''Close Encounters'' entirely on [[sound stage]]s. He dropped the idea. Stages 15 and 16 at [[Warner Bros.]] Studios in [[Burbank, California]], [[Devils Tower National Monument]], [[Mumbai]] and an abandoned [[World War II]] [[airship]] hangar in [[Mobile, Alabama]] were used for locations. The hangar in Alabama was six times larger than the largest sound stage in the world.<ref name=come/><ref name=pro/> Various technical and budgetary problems came during filming. Spielberg called ''Close Encounters'' "twice as bad and twice as expensive [as ''Jaws'']".<ref name=Dreyfuss/> Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties. Spielberg estimated the film would cost $2.7 million to make in his original 1973 [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] to Columbia, but the final budget came to $19.4 million.<ref name=come/> 

Columbia [[studio executive]] John Veich remembered, "If we knew it was going to cost that much, we wouldn't have [[greenlight]]ed it because we didn't have the money."<ref name=come/> Truffant said it was producer [[Julia Phillips]]'s fault as to why the budget escalated. Spielberg hired [[Joe Alves]], his collaborator on ''Jaws'', as [[production designer]].<ref name=actor/>  In addition the [[1976 Atlantic hurricane season]] caused [[tropical cyclone]]s in Alabama. A large portion of the sound stage in Alabama was damaged because of a [[lightning strike]].<ref name=making/> During filming, [[cinematographer]] [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] remembered, "Every night Steve watched movies and got more more ideas. He added more shots to the [[shooting schedule]], pushing it back. One crew member said, 'Steven, if you would stop watching those fucking movies every night we would be on schedule.'"<ref name=Dreyfuss/> Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on ''Jaws''. In her book ''You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again'' (ISBN 0-394-57574-1), producer [[Julia Phillips]] wrote highly [[profanity|profaning]] remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond and Truffant. She was fired during post-production because of [[cocaine dependence]]. Phillips tried to blame it on Spielberg as being a [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]].<ref name=come/>

===Visual Effects===
[[Image:Close Encounters Mothership.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Mothership model at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center|Udvar-Hazy Center]]]]
[[Douglas Trumbull]] was the [[visual effects supervisor]], while [[Carlo Rambaldi]] designed the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3 million, could have been made to produce another film. His work helped lead to advances in [[motion control photography]]. The [[mother ship]] was designed by [[Ralph McQuarrie]] and built by [[Greg Jein]].<ref name=Dreyfuss/> Many of the [[model maker]]s attempted comical objects in the UFOs. One was an [[oxygen mask]] with lights, while [[Dennis Muren]] put an [[in-joke]] from his work on ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', using an [[R2-D2]] toy.<ref name=making/> Since ''Close Encounters'' was filmed [[anamorphic format|anamorphically]], the visual effects sequences were shot in [[70 mm film]] to better accommodate with the [[35 mm film]]. A test reel using [[computer-generated imagery]] was used for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be too expensive since CGI was new technology in the 1970s.<ref name=making/> The small aliens in the final scenes were played by local girls in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. That decision was requested by Spielberg because he felt "girls move more gracefully than boys". [[Puppetry]] was attempted for the aliens, but the idea failed. However, Rambaldi successfully used puppetry to depict the alien that communicates with Lacombe near the end of the film.<ref name=making/>

===Post-production===
''Close Encounters'' is the first collaboration between [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] and Spielberg. Their relationship continued for the rest of Spielberg's films. When Kahn and Spielberg delivered the first cut of the film, Spielberg was dissatisfied, feeling "there wasn't enough wow-ness".<ref name=making/> [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|Pick-up]]s were commissioned but cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond could not participate.<ref name=come/> [[John A. Alonzo]], [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Kov<U+00E1>cs (cinematographer)|L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Kov<U+00E1>cs]], [[William A. Fraker]] and [[Douglas Slocombe]] worked on the pick-ups.<ref name=come/> Lacombe was originally to find [[Flight 19]] hidden in the [[Amazon Rainforest]], but the idea was changed to the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This was an important scene added in the re-shoots. Composer [[John Williams]] wrote over 300 examples of the iconic five-music [[note]] before Spielberg choose the right one. Spielberg called Williams' work as "[[When You Wish upon a Star]] meets science fiction".<ref name=making/> Spielberg wanted to have "When You Wish upon a Star" in the [[closing credits]], but was denied permission. He also took 7.5 minutes out from the [[preview]].<ref name=actor/>

==Themes==
Film critic Charlene Engel observed ''Close Encounters'' "suggests that humankind has reached the point where it is ready to enter the community of the cosmos. While it is a computer interface which makes the final musical conversation with the alien guests possible, the characteristics bringing Neary to make his way to Devil's Tower have little to do with technical expertise or computer literacy. These are virtues taught in schools that will be evolved in the 21st century."<ref name=Barry>{{cite book | author= Charlene Engel | title = The Films of Steven Spielberg | year = 2002 | publisher = Scarecrow Press | chapter = Close Encounters of the Third Kind | pages = 45&mdash;56 | isbn = 0-8108-4182-7}}</ref> The film also evokes typical [[science fiction]] [[archetype]]s and motifs. The film portrays new technologies as a natural and expected outcome of human development and indication of health and growth.<ref name=Barry/>

Other critics found a variety of Christian analogies. Devil's Tower parallels [[Mount Sinai]], the aliens as Gods and Roy Neary as [[Moses]]. [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' is seen on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between [[Ezekiel]] and Roy; Ezekiel was taken into a "chariot of fire", akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devil's Tower behind Jillian and faltering, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, similar to [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]'s wife who looked back at [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] and turned into a pillar of salt.<ref name=Barry/> Spielberg explained, "I wanted to make ''Close Encounters'' a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it in to complete upheaval as her starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience."<ref name=pro/> 

Roy's wife Ronnie attempts to hide the sunburn caused by Roy's exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. She is embarrassed and bewildered by what has happened to him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when his is sculpting a huge model of Devil's Tower in his living room, with his family deserting him.<ref name=Barry/> ''Close Encounters'' also studies the form of "youth spiritual yearning". Barry Guiler, the unfearing child who refers to the UFOs and their paraphernalia as "Toys", serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness in the face of the unknown.<ref name=Barry/> Spielberg also compared the theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance. "If we can talk to aliens in ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''," he said, "why not with the [[Communism|Reds]] in the [[Cold War]]?"<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Richard Schickel]] (interviewer) | title = Spielberg on Spielberg | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies]] | year = [[2007-07-09]]}}</ref> Sleeping is the final obstacle to overcome in the ascent of Devil's Tower. Roy, Jillian Guiler and a third invitee climb the mountain pursued by government helicopters spraying sleeping gas. The third person stops to rest, is gassed, and falls into a deep sleep.<ref name=Barry/>

===Release===
The film was originally to be released in early-1977, but was pushed to November because of the various problems during filming.<ref name=actor/> ''Close Encounters'' was a [[box office]] financial success, grossing $116.39 million in North America and $171.7 million in foreign countries, totaling $288 million.<ref name=box>{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=closeencountersofthethirdkind.htm | title = Close Encounters of the Third Kind | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-09-12}}</ref> It was [[Columbia Pictures]]' most successful film at the time of release.<ref name=pro>DVD production notes</ref> [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] refers to the film as "the best expression of Spielberg's benign, dreamy-eyed vision."<ref>{{cite web | url =  http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/2011_CLOSE_ENCOUNTERS_OF_THE_THIRD_KIND | title = Close Encounters of the Third Kind | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | accessdate = 2008-09-12}}</ref> A.D. Murphy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a positive review but felt "''Close Encounters'' lacks the warmth and humanity of [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''".

===Reissue and home video===
On the [[final cut privilege]], Spielberg was dissatisfied with ''Close Encounters''. "Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," Spielberg explained. "Anyway, ''Close Encounters'' was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted to make my own [[director's cut]]. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the [[mother ship]] so they could have something to "campaign" on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship."<ref name=making/> In 1979, Columbia Pictures gave Spielberg $2.5 million to start [[reissue]]ing the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but the reissue was still three minutes shorter than the theatrical release.<ref name=Amy/>

It featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the ''[[SS Cotopaxi]]'' in the [[Gobi Desert]], and a view of the inside of the mother ship. ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition'' was released on January 1, 1980, making a further $15.7 million, accumulating a final $303.79 million box office gross.<ref name=box/><ref name=Amy/> [[Roger Ebert]] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. This new version is quite simply a better film. Why didn't Spielberg make it this good the first time?"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800101/REVIEWS/1010309/1023 | title = Close Encounters of the Third Kind | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = [[1980-01-01]] | accessdate = 2008-09-12}}</ref>

''Close Encounters'' was given a 2-disc DVD release in August 2002, which contained the "Collector's Edition".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Close-Encounters-Third-Widescreen-Collectors/dp/B00006ADD4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1221266635&sr=1-3 | title = Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Widescreen Collector's Edition) (1977) | work = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-12}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] felt "''Close Encounters'' is still unquestionably a great movie. Its universal appeal gave movie-goers something to be excited about during 1977-78 as the first in a wave of post-''Star Wars'' [[science fiction film]]s broke. Today, the movie stands up remarkably well. The story is fresh and compelling, the special effects are as remarkable as anything that [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] can do, and the music represents some of [[John Williams]]' best work."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=166 | title = Close Encounters of the Third Kind | work = [[James Berardinelli]] | accessdate = 2008-09-12}}</ref> [[Emanuel Levy]] also gave a highly-positive review. "Spielberg's greatest achievement is to make a warm, likable sci-fi feature, deviating in spirit, tone and ideology from the dark, [[film noir|noir]]ish [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)|sci-fi films that dominated the 1950s]] and [[Cold War]] mentality.

===Legacy===
{{seealso|Night Skies}}
Shortly after the release in late-1977, Spielberg desired to do either a sequel or [[prequel]]. He explained, "The Army's knowledge and ensuing [[cover-up]] is so subterranean that it would take a creative screen story, perhaps someone else making the picture and giving it the equal time it deserves."<ref name=mind>{{cite news | author = Steve Poster | title = The Mind Behind ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' | work = [[Film Comment]] | pages=23&mdash;29 | date = January 1978 | accessdate = 2008-09-15}}</ref>

When asked in 1991 to select a single "master image" that summed up his film career, Spielberg chose the shot of Barry opening his living room door to see the blazing orange light from the UFO. "That was beautiful but awful light, just like fire coming through the doorway." Spielberg continued. "He's very small, and it a very large door, and there's a lot of promise or danger outside that door."<ref name=Fire/> In 2007, ''Close Encounters'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[United States Library of Congress]], and was added to the [[National Film Registry]] for preservation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.loc.gov/film/nfrchron.html | title = National Film Registry: 1989-2007 | work = [[National Film Registry]] | accessdate = 2008-05-09}}</ref> In [[American Film Institute]] polls, ''Close Encounters'' has been voted the sixty-fourth [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|greatest film of all time]],<ref>{{cite web | title = AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies | work = [[American Film Institute]] | url = http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/movies.aspx | accessdate = 2007-04-04}}</ref> thirty-first [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills|most thrilling]]<ref>{{cite web | title = America's Most Heart-Pounding Movies | work = [[American Film Institute]] | url = http://www.afi.com/Docs/tvevents/pdf/thrills100.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-04-04}}</ref> and fifty-eighth [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers|most uplifting]].<ref>{{cite web | title = America's Most Uplifting Movies | work = [[American Film Institute]] | url = http://www.afi.com/docs/tvevents/pdf/cheers100.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-04-04}}</ref>
