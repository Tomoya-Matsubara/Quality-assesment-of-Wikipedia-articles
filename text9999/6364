MS 350 starts at a [[T-intersection]] with MS 2 and travels eastward. The route goes through small groups of trees, and turns northeast east of County Road 154. The road enters a larger forest and curves back east {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} later. There, MS 350 was less than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} from the [[Tennessee]] state line. The two-lane road intersects a few roads leading to the state border, such as Kendrick Road. MS 350 soon enters Tishomingo County, curving around some hills. It remains parellel from the state line, until at County Road 375, where it starts to travel southeast. The route temporarily travels east at County Road 355, before heading southeast again. MS 350 ends about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}}, at a T-intersection with MS 25.<ref name=BingMaps/>
