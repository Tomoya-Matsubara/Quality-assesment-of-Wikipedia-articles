The '''L<U+00E9>vis Forts''' are a series of three [[forts]] located on the South Shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] in the [[Province of Quebec]], [[Canada]]. They are at shooting distance of one another which allows the defend a wide area without the cost of a continuous [[defensive wall]].  The first one was build (1865-1872) by the [[British Army]] and the other ones by private businesses (1865-1869).  The costs were almost identical for all three, ranging from 57,600 to 59,762 pounds.  

During the [[American Civil War]], Great Britain claimed to remain neutral in the conflict. However, the coton directly imported from the south of the Unites States still had a great importance in the British textile industry. Following the Civil War, the British were still expecting an American invasion of Canada.

The tense political relationship between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] had the British worried about their wood supply, if the access to the [[Baltic Sea]] was blocked. The Canadian forests would then be used as Great Britain main wood supply.

Lieutenant-Colonel [[William Francis Drummond Jervois]] was sent to Canada to establish the Canadian defence plan. He suggested that detached forts be built on Pointe-L<U+00E9>vy, on the south shore of Quebec City. The original plans recommanded 5 forts, of which 3 were actually built.
