==Geography==
Princes Coverts is 864 acres (349 [[hectare]]s) of managed woodland [[Crown Estate]].  It includes, separated by roads, a minor northern woodland beyond Fairoaks Lane, ''Great Oakes'' and ''Sixty Acre Wood'', and the irregularly shaped (partly converted to other use) ''Woodlands Park'' to the south.  

The southernmost portion of the very long and quite narrow, almost rectangular Crown Estate has been assigned to and converted to [[Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People]]'s Training College and its Dorincourt home for the disabled, Woodlands Park Golf Course, [[Leatherhead]], and Tyrwhitt House, a combat stress centre.

While the south drains southward to [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]] {{convert|0.5|mi}} south of the training college, the north, divided by rises, contains three sources of [[the Rythe]] and drains northward.<ref name=os>[http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=g&gazString=TQ1560 Grid square map] [[Ordnance survey]] website</ref>  The remaining Princes Coverts area is referred to by the Crown as '''Oxshott Woods'''.<ref name=welc>''Welcome to Prince's Coverts Oxshott'' - Leaflet published by The Crown Estate Office, The Great Park, Windsor, SL4 2HT</ref>

==History==
Prince's Coverts is named after Prince (later King) [[Leopold I of Belgium]], who lived at Claremont Park, [[Esher]] {{convert|1|mi}} north-west, which remains linked by a [[bridleway]] across Arbrook Common and Farm which has two white-painted metal [[coal tax post]]s.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1030285}}</ref>

The Claremont Estate was purchased for him in 1816. He later acquired nearby common land which became a shooting estate. This area became known as Prince's Coverts. Following his death, the estate was re-purchased by the Crown since which it has been managed by The Crown Estate.<ref name=welc/>

==Land Features==
* Jessop's Well (recorded in some maps as Chalybeate) - a [[mineral spa]] converted to a very small spa house that was built in the mid 18th century.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1189128}}</ref> The water was sold for a period for 6[[penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]{{cn|date=17 October 2013}} per gallon<!-- this was the standard unit of water in Victorian England; correct if it was per pint or quart--> to owner-occupiers of [[Berkeley Square]], London.
* Horns Hill - The highest point of the relatively gentle rises in Prince's Coverts at 260 feet (79 metres), is one of a series of [[wikt:knoll]]s consisting of [[gravel]] and [[London clay]] in a band north of the centre of much higher [[North Downs]] where deposits have made for a [[loam]]-rich soil.  Geologically and in soil terms this range extends through [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[Streatham Hill]], [[Tulse Hill]], [[Sydenham]] and [[Penge]].
