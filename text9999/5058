[[Image:Miller V.jpg|thumb|Keith Miller in 1946]]
The '''early life of [[Keith Miller]]''', an [[Australia]]n [[Test cricket]]er and [[Australian rules football]]er, spans the period from his birth on 28 November 1919 until 20 August 1940, when he joined the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] (army reserve) during the [[Second World War]]. Miller's early life was dominated by his interest in sport. The youngest of four children of Scottish descent, Miller joined his siblings in being inculcated with a love of sport by his father, playing football in winter and cricket in summer. Miller's father emphasised the importance of technique over power; Miller needed the former as he was of small stature in his childhood and could not rely on brute strength. Due to his size, Miller yearned to be a [[horse racing]] jockey.

Miller received his secondary education at the academically selective [[Melbourne High School]], where his mathematics teacher was the then Australian cricket captain [[Bill Woodfull]]. Miller neglected his studies and was academically poor, but he excelled at sports. He made the school's First XI cricket team at the age of 14 and gained attention for his technical and defensive ability, which was compared to that of Woodfull. He was rejected by the [[St Kilda Cricket Club]] so he signed up for [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne]] in [[Victorian Premier Cricket|district cricket]], making his debut at the start of the 1935&ndash;36 season, still only 162&nbsp;cm tall. He went on score a rearguard 61 in a low-scoring match against Woodfull's [[Carlton Cricket Club|Carlton]] team, prompting Woodfull to award him a silver eggcup during maths class. It remained one of his most treasured possessions.

In the following year, Miller grew 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) and began to play cricket and football with more power. Leaving school at the end of year ten, he played cricket for the Victorian Colts for two seasons, before breaking through for his first-class debut late in the 1937&ndash;38 season. He played sporadically until making his [[Sheffield Shield]] debut during the 1939&ndash;40 season and scoring his maiden [[century (cricket)|century]]. During this time, Miller played exclusively as a batsman. Miller's football career also took off. He played for the [[Brighton Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football Association]] for three years starting in 1937, mainly as a defender. At the start of his fourth season, he restricted [[Bob Pratt]], regarded as the best forward of the time, to one goal, and was promptly signed by the [[St Kilda Saints]] to play in the leading [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] in 1940, where the Saints' came second to last.

== Birth ==

Born in the western [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Sunshine, Victoria|Sunshine]] on 28 November 1919, Keith Ross Miller was the youngest of Leslie (Les Sr) and Edith (Edie) Miller's four children.<ref name="p10"/> Miller had two elder brothers and an sister. Gladys was 12 when Miller was born, while Les Jr and Ray were nine and seven respectively.<Ref name="p11">Perry, p. 11.</ref> He was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Ross]] and [[Keith Macpherson Smith|Keith Smith]], who were half-way through their historic [[England to Australia flight|flight from England to Australia]] at the time Miller was born.<ref name="Pollard">{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=Jack|title=Australian Cricket:The Game and the Players|year=1988|publisher=Angus & Robertson|location=Sydney|isbn=0 207 15269 1|pages = 755&ndash;759}}</ref><Ref name="p10">Perry, p. 10.</ref> Miller's two Christian names reflected his [[Scottish people|Scottish]] heritage; his father's family originated from the dock area of [[Edinburgh]] and [[Dundee]].<ref name="p10"/> Miller's paternal grandfather had come to Australia in April 1849.<ref name="p10"/> The family lived in a one-level terrace house in Sunshine, which at the time was a separate town of 900 people, eleven kilometres west of Melbourne. The town was dominated by the farm machinery maker [[H. V. McKay]]. Miller's father was originally a teacher in [[Warracknabeal]] in rural Victoria, before working for McKay in [[Ballarat]] until a transfer brought him to Sunshine.<ref name="p11"/>

==Early schooling==
Sunshine offered open fields, and the three Miller boys quickly took a liking to sport in their childhood, playing [[Australian rules football]] in winter and [[cricket]] in summer. Their father had been a player for [[Warracknabeal]], winning a premiership in the local league in 1900. Les taught the boys to play with a side-on stance and underlined the importance of correct batting technique.<Ref name="p11"/> He reminded his sons to use a high leading elbow.<Ref name="p11"/> They were taught to rely on a solid defence, concentration, and self-control in the mould of the leading Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the era, [[Bill Ponsford]].<ref name="p12">Perry, p. 12.</ref> Miller began his schooling in Sunshine, where he quickly became known for his diminutive height, being one of the smallest children in the school.<ref name="p12"/> At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to the inner-eastern middle-class Melbourne suburb of [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], where his parents had purchased a two-storey house with a spacious garden for the children to play sport. By this time his elder brothers had given him the derisive nickname ''Weedy''.<ref name="p12"/> Miller's small size and his age deficit to his brothers meant that he conceded a strength advantage in backyard cricket matches. This forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, which held him in good stead for his future playing. Whenever Miller managed to dismiss his brothers to earn himself some batting time, he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner. Miller and his friends would loiter outside Ponsford's home, just 400&nbsp;m (1310&nbsp;ft) away, in the hope of catching a glimpse of their hero.<Ref name="p13">Perry, p. 13.</ref> Like Miller in the backyard, Ponsford was known for his powers of concentration, having scored two quadruple centuries in first-class cricket.<Ref name="p14">Perry, p. 14.</ref> Miller often practised for hours by himself, putting a tennis ball inside a stocking before suspending it from a clothes line and hitting it back and forth.<Ref name="p15"/>

A small child, Miller's major sporting aspiration was to be a [[jockey]]; he also played cricket and Australian football.<ref name=SMH>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/11/1097406502446.html |title=Death of a hero |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |first=Greg |last=Baum |date=2004-10-12 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> At the age of 12, he played for an under-15 Victorian schoolboys cricket team captained by [[Merv Harvey]], which played in [[Queensland]].<Ref name="Coleman"/> At the time, he stood only {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} and wielded a sawn-off bat.<Ref name="p15"/> His shots did not go a long way, but he impressed observers with the manner in which he moved his feet and stroked the ball.<Ref name="p15"/> Miller's small stature in a contact sport such as football forced him to rely on physical courage, something for which he was known.<ref name="p16">Perry, p. 16.</ref> However, his lack of growth in childhood made him turn to horseracing. [[Caulfield Racecourse]] was only a short ways away from the family home, and Miller spent many early mornings watching the trainers and jockeys go about their routines. Miller eventually persuaded his father to let him take horseriding lessons.<Ref name="p16"/> Aside from being attracted to the culture of racing, Miller felt that as he appeared destined to be a small person, a successful career as a jockey was more likely than cricket or football.<ref name="p17">Perry, p. 17.</ref>

==Melbourne High School==
[[Image:Melbourne high school cricket.jpg|thumb|The Melbourne High School cricket team. Miller is standing at right. Truscott is seated with shield.]]
He went to the local state school before transferring to [[Melbourne High School]], a selective school, at the start of 1934.<ref name="p17"/> The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was more in line with that of a private school.<Ref name="p18"/> [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] Test captain [[Bill Woodfull]] was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.<ref name="Coleman">{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Robert |title=Seasons In the Sun: the Story Of the Victorian Cricket Association |year=1993 |publisher=Hargreen Publishing |location=Melbourne |isbn=0 949905 59 3 |pages = 473&ndash;478}}</ref> Miller was a mediocre student, as he did little study and focused his energy on sport.<Ref name="p18">Perry, p. 18.</ref> In addition to cricket and football, he also played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school motto, which meant ''Honour the Work'' and exhorted his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="p18"/> Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in coaching the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills.<ref name="p19">Perry, p. 19.</ref> Miller, aged 14 and still under {{convert|153|cm|in|abbr=on}}, was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut, and although his lack of power was obvious, his control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him ''the Unbowlable'', the same nickname which was accorded to the similarly strong defensive style of Woodfull. Melbourne went on to win the match.<Ref name="p20">Perry, p. 20.</ref> Miller impressed his captain [[Keith Truscott]], who fought for his selection and took him under his wing.<ref name="p20"/> Truscott was later to become an ace fighter pilot in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and Miller would follow him into to air force as well. Truscott's social influence also compounded the distractions from Miller's study. He failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, with an average mark of 25%, and was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class.<Ref name="p21">Perry, p. 21.</ref> As a result, Miller was forced to repeat year 9.<ref name="p22">Perry, p. 22.</ref>

==Club cricket==
[[Image:Awm 044827 ( truscott 1941).jpg|Keith Truscott, Miller's schoolboy cricket captain and mentor.|thumb]]
Truscott took Miller to a try out with [[St Kilda Cricket Club|St Kilda]] at the start of the 1934&ndash;35 season, but Miller could not find a place in any of its five teams.<ref name="p21"/> Joining the local [[Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association|sub-district]] cricket club Elsternwick, he did not get to bat or bowl in his first match, and was then dropped to the Second XI for his poor fielding.<ref name=Coleman>Coleman (1993), pp 522&ndash;529.</ref><ref name="p21"/> Nevertheless, the former [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victorian]] state player [[Hughie Carroll]] spotted Miller's talent and lured him to the rival [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne]] club.<ref name="p22"/> However, Elsternwick prevented him from playing for Souths, so he continued playing in the seconds for Elsternwick.<Ref name="p22"/> In the meantime he continued playing for his school, with steady results, scoring 30 and 25 in two matches against Melbourne's main rival [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]]. A relaxing of the zoning rules allowed Miller to start playing for South Melbourne in the following season.<ref name="p22"/> However, the rules required South Melbourne to play him in their First XI or St Kilda could reclaim him, so he made his [[Victorian Premier Cricket|district cricket]] debut for South at the start of the 1935&ndash;36 season after a trial in the nets.<Ref name="p23">Perry, p. 23.</ref> At this stage, he was just {{convert|162|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall&mdash;the Test batsman [[Keith Rigg]] recalls his first encounter with Miller in a district match:
{{quote|He was so small he came in to bat with pads flapping around up near his waist. [[Hans Ebeling]] was bowling and Keith hit him through the covers for four. I thought, 'Crikey, who's this kid?'<ref name=Coleman/><ref name="p15">Perry, p. 15.</ref>}}

It was at South Melbourne that he met [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Lindsay Hassett]], his future Australia team-mates and captains. Miller scored only 12 not out batting at No. 7 on debut against St Kilda, but observers felt he would succeed if he could physically grow.<ref name="p23"/> Miller passed his exams at the end of 1935 and continued his improvement on the field. He began to develop a [[leg break]] and [[googly]] and represented his school against a visiting schoolboy team from [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. Miller scored an unbeaten 28 to prevent a loss and later claimed that the experience had helped broaden his horizons towards other cultures.<ref name="p24"/> Assisted by cross-training in baseball, his fielding improvement saw him placed in the slips and he was named as Melbourne High School's cricket sports champion for 1936.<ref name="p24">Perry, p. 24.</ref> Miller had averaged 86 with the bat and taken 13 [[wicket]]s at an average of 9.23, including [[innings]] figures of 7/29 against St Kevin's and 3/5 against University High.<Ref>7/29 means that the bowler took seven [[wicket]]s but conceded 29 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in doing so.</ref> This prompted Woodfull to write in the school magazine that "Miller has Test possibilities".<ref name="p25">Perry, p. 25.</ref> 

[[Image:WMWoodfull.jpg|thumb|The Australian cricket captain [[Bill Woodfull]] was Miller's high school mathematics teacher. Woodfull presented Miller with a silver eggcup during maths class in recognition of the 61 Miller scored against Woodfull's club side.]]
In March, he played for South Melbourne against [[Carlton Cricket Club|Carlton]], captained by Woodfull. South Melbourne batted first and collapsed to 5/6.<ref name="p25"/> The sixth wicket fell at 32 and Miller came to the crease. He guided his team to 141, putting on a stand of 65 in 95 minutes with the last man and finishing with 61. He had struck four boundaries in a 147-minute innings.<ref name="p26">Perry, p. 26.</ref> The crowd of 14,000, the largest of the season, gave Miller a standing ovation, and newspapers compared him to Ponsford and [[Alan Kippax]].<Ref name="p27">Perry, p. 27.</ref> Carlton went on to win the game, and when it was obvious that this was the case, Miller's captain let him bowl for the first time and he took his first wicket in district cricket when Test paceman [[Laurie Nash]] took a high-leaping catch.<Ref name="p27"/> Miller's performance prompted Carlton to donate a silver eggcup as a memento "for sterling performance". Woodfull presented Miller with the trophy during algebra class.<ref name="p27"/> It was one of the few trophies from his sporting career that he kept in later life.<ref name="FabFarewell">{{cite news |title = Fab farewell for cricket legend Keith Miller |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/20/1097951766524.html?from=storylhs |work = [[The Age]] |date = [[2004-10-20]] |accessdate = 2007-12-22}}</ref>

During 1936, Miller underwent a sudden growth spurt, including a  three month period in which he lengthened by {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="p25"/> He began to play football in a more physical and aggressive manner and developed the ability to leap high and take airborne [[mark (Australian football)|marks]].<ref name="p28">Perry, p. 28.</ref> He increase in size allowed him to become the longest kicker in the school team. Having grown {{convert|28|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in a year, upon his return to South Melbourne the following season, he was unrecognisable to [[Lindsay Hassett]].<Ref name="p29">Perry, p. 29.</ref> Eventually, Miller reached {{convert|185|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in height, thwarting his ambition to be a jockey although he never lost his love for the racetrack.<ref name=Coleman/>

==Representative beginnings==
At the start of the 1936&ndash;37 season, he was selected for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level.<Ref name="p29"/> At the end of the 1936 school year, he completed year 10, passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards heading to university, he left school without finishing his Leaving year and took a position as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that he could make a career out of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.<ref name="p30">Perry, p. 30.</ref>

Miller spent the 1937&ndash;38 season with the Colts and won the team's batting trophy for having the best average with 340 runs at 42.50. Across the entire competition, he had the eighth highest average.<ref name=Coleman/><ref name="p30"/> He scored three half-centuries and a 102 against Northcote.<Ref name="p32">Perry, p. 32.</ref> At this stage, he was a solid, slow and steady batsman, who accumulated his runs gradually, but ''[[The Age]]'' predicted that his physical growth would open his horizons, opining "Once he fills out&mdash;he is rather tall for his weight&mdash;Miller should become a brilliant, aggressive batsman".<Ref name="p31">Perry, p. 31.</ref> In early February, late in the summer, he made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for Victoria as an 18-year old and hit 181 in 289 minutes against [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16497.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |title=Victoria v Tasmania Other First-Class matches in Australia 1937/38 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> With his increased power, he began to loft the ball over the infield and struck five fours.<Ref name="p32"/> In 1938&ndash;39, he rejoined South Melbourne and played four first-class matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs at an average of 25.00.

He achieved more success as a footballer after following his brothers Les and Ray in joining the [[Brighton Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) in 1937.<ref name=Coleman/> A defender, Miller played his first two seasons on the flanks, as he was yet to reach his physical peak and lacked the power to play in central defensive positions until his third year in 1939.<Ref name="p33"/> At this stage, he was unable to [[hip and shoulder]] his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.<Ref name="p33">Perry, p. 33.</ref>

[[Image:Young miller drive.jpg|thumb|Miller plays a cover drive at the age of 18.]]
In 1939&ndash;40, Miller was selected to make his Sheffield Shield debut, against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] at [[Adelaide Oval]].<ref name="p35">Perry, p. 35.</ref> Batting at No. 4, Miller came to the crease at 2/9 after a top-order collapse, but managed only four before being caught by future co-writer [[Richard Whitington]] from the bowling of [[Harold Cotton]].<ref name="p36"/><Ref name=ss>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17218.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |title=South Australia v Victoria Sheffield Shield 1939/40 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> When Victoria fielded, Miller [[run out|ran out]] his future ''Invincibles'' captain [[Don Bradman]], the first time that Bradman had been caught short of his ground in first-class cricket.<ref name="p36">Perry, p. 36.</ref> He also took his first catch at Shield level, that of [[Mervyn Waite]].<Ref name=ss/> In the second innings, he managed seven before being bowled by  [[leg spin]]ner [[Clarrie Grimmett]],<ref name="p37">Perry, p. 37.</ref> who had been one of the world's leading bowlers in the 1930s.<Ref name="p35"/> One of Miller's teammates was [[Percy Beames]], who happened to be his manager at [[Vacuum Oil]], where he had moved from his first job.<ref name="p38"/> Miller scored 41 and 47 not out in his second match against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]], top scoring in the second innings as his team completed a seven-wicket victory.<Ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17228.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |title=Victoria v Queensland Sheffield Shield 1939/40 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> Miller retained his place for the match against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]], but was out for 14 in both innings, having difficulties against leg spin, falling once to [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] and the other time to [[Cec Pepper]].<Ref name="p38">Perry, p. 38.</ref> In the return match against South Australia, Miller decided to take the initiative against Grimmett, charging down the wicket to drive the leg spinner. He featured in a 165-run partnership with Hassett, at times bluffing Grimmett by moving forward before leaning back after the bowler had adjusted his length. Miller reached 108, his first century in Shield competition. He was given out caught by Bradman from Garth Burton, after a disputed catch in which he asked the umpires if he had hit a [[bump ball]].<Ref name="p39">Perry, p. 39.</ref><Ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17243.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |title=Victoria v South Australia Sheffield Shield 1939/40 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> Nevertheless, Bradman praised Miller's innings.<Ref name="p40">Perry, p. 40.</ref> Apart from the century, Miller had an average season, making 37, one and 24 in his remaining innings to end with 298 runs at 29.80.<ref name=o/> He did not bowl during the season.<Ref name="p43">Perry, p. 43.</ref>

=== Breakthrough into the VFL ===

In 1940, Miller started his fourth season in the VFA. In a match against [[Coburg Tigers|Coburg]], regarded as one of the strongest teams in the competition, he was assigned to man the greatest forward of the era, [[Bob Pratt]].<Ref name="p44">Perry, p. 44.</ref> Pratt had scored 678 goals in ten seasons for [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), the top tier of football, and had scored more than 100 goals in each of the last three seasons.<ref name="p45">Perry, p. 45.</ref> Miller managed to restrict Pratt to one goal for the match and was named as the best on ground. In the third quarter of the match, Miller restricted him to two marks, and in the fourth quarter, he prevented Pratt from getting a single kick. Scouts from the VFL club [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] signed Miller on the spot.<ref name="p46">Perry, p. 46.</ref> Upon Miller's signing, ''The Age'' opined that he "is one of the most promising players ever to enter league ranks, and can be played anywhere in defence. It was he who kept Bob Pratt to one goal in last week's Association match".<ref name="p46"/>

At the time, [[World War II]] had broken out and by mid-1940, [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[The Netherlands]] had fallen to [[Nazi Germany]]. Australia had declared war on Germany and Miller wanted to join the military, but St Kilda told him that if he was deployed outside Victoria, his career would be in jeopardy. As a result, Miller postponed his enlistment until the end of the season.<Ref name="p47"/>

Playing as a defender, Miller debuted for St Kilda in their fifth round home game against [[Carlton Blues|Carlton]], at the [[Junction Oval]] on 25 May, playing on the half-back flank. Immediately upon the start of the game, his opponent [[Ron Cooper (Australian footballer)|Ron Cooper]] [[king hit]] him, resulting in concussion. Miller said of the experience, "I learnt more in a second or two than I would have in a year".<Ref name="p47">Perry, p. 47.</ref><ref name="Main">{{cite book |last=Main |first=Jim |coauthors=Holmesby, Russell |title=The encyclopedia of league footballers |year=1992 |publisher=Wilkinson |location=Melbourne |isbn=1 86337 085 4 |page=269 }}</ref><Ref name=vfl>{{cite web| url=http://stats.rleague.com/afl/seas/1940.html |title=1940 Season Scores and Results |publisher=Rleague |accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> When St Kilda next met Carlton in the return match at [[Princes Park]] on 17 August,<Ref name=vfl/> Miller shoulder bumped Cooper in the first minute of the match, forcing his opponent to leave the field.<ref name="p48"/> In a match against [[Richmond Tigers|Richmond]], Miller was targeted by its renowned enforcer [[Jack Dyer]], known as ''Captain Blood''.
