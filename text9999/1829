The '''Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23''' was a single-seat, twin-engined prototype [[fighter aircraft]] designed for the [[United States Air Force]]. It was a finalist in the [[United States Air Force]]'s (USAF) [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] competition.  Two YF-23s were built, nicknamed "Black Widow II" and "Gray Ghost".  The YF-23 competed against the [[Lockheed YF-22|YF-22]] for a USAF production contract.  

In the 1980s, the USAF began looking for a replacement for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]]. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. The [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]/[[Boeing]]/[[General Dynamics]] camp entered the YF-22. The [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]]/[[McDonnell Douglas]] group promoted the larger YF-23. This aircraft, using some existing components from the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]], was stealthier and faster but less agile than its YF-22 counterpart.  After an evaluation process, the YF-22 was announced the winner in 1991 and would later enter production as the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]].  Both YF-23s are now museum exhibits.

== Design and development ==

In 1981, the U.S. Air Force began forming a requirement for an [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (ATF) as a new air superiority fighter to replace the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]].<ref name=Sweetman_p12-3>Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>13.</ref> The need for a more advanced aircraft was emphasized by the discovery of new advanced Soviet [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] fighters.<ref name=Miller_p10>Miller 2005, p.&nbsp;10.</ref>  The ATF would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon including [[composite material]]s, lightweight [[alloy]]s, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and [[stealth technology]].<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2382 "Fact sheet: Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics YF-22]". NationalMuseum.af.mil, 11 February 2009. Retrieved: 18 June 2011.</ref> In 1985 the Air Force sent out technical requests for proposals to a number of aircraft manufacturing teams. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was issued in July 1986, and two contractor teams, [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]/[[Boeing]]/[[General Dynamics]] and Northrop/McDonnell Douglas were selected on 31&nbsp;October&nbsp;1986 to undertake a 50-month demonstration phase, culminating in the flight test of two prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23.<ref>Jenkins and Landis, pp.&nbsp;233<U+2013>234.</ref><ref>Williams 2002, pp.&nbsp;5<U+2013>6.</ref><ref name=winchester>Winchester 2005, pp.&nbsp;198<U+2013>199.</ref>

The YF-23 was designed to meet USAF requirements for survivability, [[supercruise]], stealth, and ease of maintenance.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%203004.html "ATF procurement launches new era"]. ''Flight International'', 15 November 1986. Retrieved: 25 June 2011.</ref> Designed with all-aspect stealth as a high priority, Northrop drew on the company's experience with the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]]. The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft with [[trapezoidal wing]]s, substantial [[area rule|area-ruling]], and a [[V-tail]].<ref name=winchester/>  Similar to the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat ablating tiles, to shield the exhaust from infrared (IR) missile detection from below.<ref>Sweetman 1991, p.&nbsp;44.</ref>  The vehicle management system coordinated movements of the control surfaces for maneuvers and for stable flight, along with other aircraft functions.<ref>Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;34<U+2013>35.</ref> The wing flaps and ailerons deflected inversely on either side to provide roll. Pitch was provided by moving both V-tails in the same direction, and yaw was supplied by opposite movement. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking.<ref>Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;43<U+2013>45.</ref>

Although the YF-23 featured an advanced design, in order to reduce development costs and time a number of components from existing designs were used, including the standard F-15 nose wheel unit, some F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref name=winchester/><ref name="J&L, p. 237">Jenkins and Landis, p.&nbsp;237.</ref> Two aircraft were built. YF-23 #1 (PAV-1) was fitted with [[Pratt & Whitney F119|Pratt & Whitney YF119]] engines, while YF-23 #2 (PAV-2) was fitted with [[General Electric YF120]] engines. The YF-23 featured fixed nozzles.<ref name=winchester/>  The YF-23s were completed in the configuration specified before the requirement for thrust reversing was dropped.<ref name=Miller_p23>Miller 2005, p.&nbsp;23.</ref><ref name=Sweetman_p23_43>Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;23, 43.</ref>

The first YF-23 ([[United States military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''87-0800'', N231YF), the gray-painted ''Gray Ghost'', was rolled out on 22&nbsp;June&nbsp;1990.<ref name="J&L, p. 237"/><ref name=Pace_ch5>Pace 1999, chapter 5.</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%201803.html "YF-23 roll out marks ATF debut."] ''Flight International'', 27 June<U+2013>3 July 1990.

== Operational history ==
=== Evaluation ===

The YF-23's weapons bay was configured for weapons launch but no missiles were fired, unlike Lockheed's demonstration aircraft.<ref name=Miller_p39>Miller 2005, p. 39.</ref> The first YF-23 with Pratt & Whitney engines supercruised at Mach&nbsp;1.43 on 18 September 1990 and the second YF-23 with General Electric engines reached Mach&nbsp;1.6 on 29 November 1990.<ref name="J&L, p. 237"/> By comparison, the YF-22 achieved Mach 1.58 in supercruise.<ref name=Goodall_p102>Goodall 1992, pp.&nbsp;102<U+2013>103.</ref>  The flight testing demonstrated Northrop's predicted performance values for the YF-23.<ref name=Miller_p39/>  Flight testing continued into December 1990.<ref name=Miller_p38-9/>  The prototypes flew 50 times for a total of 65.2 hours.<ref>Norris, Guy. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1991/1991%20-%201440.html "NASA could rescue redundant YF-23s"]. ''Flight International'', 5<U+2013>11 June 1991. Retrieved: 25 June 2011.</ref>  After testing the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF production.<ref name=Miller_p38-9>Miller 2005, pp.&nbsp;38-39.</ref>

On 23&nbsp;April&nbsp;1991, the YF-22 was announced by [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Donald Rice]] as the winner of the ATF competition.<ref>Jenkins and Landis, p.&nbsp;234.</ref> The YF-23 design was more stealthy and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile.<ref name=Goodall_p110>Goodall 1992, p.&nbsp;110.</ref> It has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992 the US Navy had abandoned NATF.<ref name=Miller_p76>Miller 2005, p. 76.</ref><ref>Williams 2002, p. 6.</ref>  Following the competition, both YF-23s were transferred to NASA's [[Dryden Flight Research Center]], at [[Edwards Air Force Base|Edwards AFB]], California, without their engines.<ref name=winchester/><ref name=NASA_DFRC/>  NASA planned to use one of the aircraft to study [[strain gauge]] loads calibration techniques, but this did not eventuate.<ref name=NASA_DFRC>[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/YF-23/index.html "YF-23 page."] ''NASA Dryden Flight Research Center,'' 20 January 1996.

=== Possible revival ===
In late 2004, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposed a YF-23-based design for the USAF's interim bomber requirement, a role for which the [[Lockheed Martin FB-22|FB-22]] and [[B-1 Lancer#B-1R|B-1R]] are also competing.<ref>Hebert, Adam J. [http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2004/November%202004/1104strike.aspx "Long-Range Strike in a Hurry."] ''Air Force magazine,'' November 2004. Retrieved: 24 June 2011.</ref>  Aircraft PAV-2 was modified by Northrop as a full-size model of its proposed interim bomber.<ref name=Miller_p39/> The interim bomber requirement has since been canceled in favor of a more [[Next-Generation Bomber|long-term, bomber replacement]] requirement, although the same YF-23-derived design could be adapted to fulfill this role as well.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news73195391.html "New Long-Range Bomber On Horizon For 2018."] ''physorg.com,'' 26 July 2006. Retrieved: 26 June 2011.</ref>  However, the possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber appeared ended with the 2006 [[Quadrennial Defense Review]], in favor of a long-range bomber with a much greater range.<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/qdr/report/Report20060203.pdf "Quadrennial Defense Review Report"].
