'''M-10''' is a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the [[Metro Detroit]] area of Michigan in the United States. The southernmost portion follows [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson Avenue]] in downtown [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], and the southern terminus is at the intersection of Jefferson and [[M-3 (Michigan highway)|M-3]] (Randolph Street) next to the entrance to the [[Detroit<U+2013>Windsor Tunnel]]. The northern terminus is in [[West Bloomfield Township, Michigan|West Bloomfield Township]] at the intersection with Orchard Lake Road. The highway has several names as it runs through residential and commercial areas of the west side of Detroit and into the suburb of [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]]. It is called the  '''John C. Lodge Freeway''', '''The Lodge''', '''James Couzens Highway''' and '''Northwestern Highway'''.

M-10 was built in segments through the late 1950s and early 1960s. It carried several different names before the entire route was finally officially named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987. The [[freeway]] has carried a few other highway designations. The southern segment was part of [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US Highway&nbsp;12]] (US&nbsp;12) and the whole thing was later renumbered [[Interstate 696 Business (Detroit, Michigan)|Business Spur Interstate 696]] (BS I-696). From 1970 until 1986, it was part of [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]], and the freeway has been M-10 since. The non-freeway segment that runs between [[Interstate 696|I-696]] in Southfield and Orchard Lake Road was previously numbered '''M-4'''.  M-10 was named after [[John C. Lodge]], an influential Detroiter and [[Mayor of Detroit]] from 1927<U+2013>28.

===Detroit===
[[File:CoboHallDetroit.jpg|thumb|left|M-10 passing under Cobo Center]]
M-10 starts at the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Randolph Street in [[Downtown Detroit]], an intersection that also marks the southern end of [[M-3 (Michigan highway)|M-3]] and the western end of [[Interstate 375 Business (Detroit, Michigan)|Business Spur I-375]]. This intersection is also the access to the [[Detroit<U+2013>Windsor Tunnel]] between the [[Renaissance Center]] and the Old [[Mariners' Church]]. From here, M-10 runs west-southwesterly parallel to the [[Detroit River]]  on Jefferson Avenue past [[Hart Plaza]]. At the intersection with [[Woodward Avenue]], M-10 transitions onto the John C. Lodge Freeway, which runs under [[Cobo Center]], home of the [[North American International Auto Show]] each January. The [[freeway]] turns north-northwesterly and away from the Detroit River next to [[Joe Louis Arena]]. North of the Cobo Center curve, M-10 forms the boundary between Downtown Detroit to the east and the [[Corktown, Detroit|Corktown]] neighborhood to the west. The freeway has a pair of [[service drive]]s as it leaves the commercial areas near the [[MGM Grand Detroit]] and the interchange with [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] (Fisher Freeway).<ref name=MDOT14D>{{cite MDOT map |year= 2014 |inset= Detroit |sections= C8<U+2013>F11}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url= https://www.google.com/maps/dir/42.3298267,-83.0422575/42.5297259,-83.3598767/@42.4297504,-83.2069909,60413m/data=!3m1!1e3 |title= Overview Map of M-10 |access-date= April 10, 2015}}</ref>

North of I-75, M-10 forms the border between [[North Corktown, Detroit|North Corktown]] (west) and [[Midtown Detroit]] (east). The freeway passes the [[MotorCity Casino]] at at the interchange with [[Grand River Avenue]]. The rest of its route in the part of the city passes through residential zones. Near the interchange with [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (Edsel Ford Freeway), M-10 passes the campus of [[Wayne State University]]. North of I-94, the Lodge Freeway is the border between the West Side and [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] . This area is residential on either side of the freeway north of the campus of the [[Henry Ford Hospital]]. North of Clairmont Avenue, M-10 curves to the northwest before resuming its north-northwesterly course near Chicago Boulevard. North of Webb Avenue, the freeway follows the western city limits of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]], an [[enclave]] within the city of Detroit. M-10 intersects [[M-8 (Michigan highway)|M-8]] where it transitions between Davison Avenue and the Davison Freeway on the western edge of Highland Park before the Lodge Freeway curves around to run due west.<ref name=MDOT14D/><ref name=google/>

M-10 runs for about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} on this due westward course before it intersects Wyoming Avenue and turns northwest. The frontage roads change names from John C. Lodge Service Drive to James Couzens Freeway at the Wyoming Avenue interchange. The freeway continues for another {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} with interchanges for local streets in this part of Detroit, including 7&nbsp;Mile Road. At the interchange with [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|M-102]] (8&nbsp;Mile Road), the freeway crosses out of Detroit and Wayne County into [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]] in [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]].<ref name=MDOT14D/><ref name=google/>

===Oakland County===
[[File:SouthfieldMichiganSkyline1.jpg|thumb|right|Looking southbound]]
The service drives change names again to Northwestern Highway upon crossing into Oakland County. The east side of M-10 is flanked by the Northland Shopping Center and a campus of [[Oakland Community College]]; the west side is residential. About {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km}} into Southfield, M-10 intersects the northern end of [[M-39 (Michigan highway)|M-39]] (Southfield Freeway) and 9&nbsp;Mile Road. The adjacent properties are mostly residential, but there are some commercial areas centered around the various [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|Mile Roads]], such as the campus of [[Lawrence Technological University]] at 10&nbsp;Mile Road.<ref name=MDOT14D/><ref name=google/> Near Lahser and 11&nbsp;Mile roads, M-10 meets [[Interstate 696|I-696]] (Reuther Freeway) and [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]] (Telegraph Road) in a complex interchange called the Mixing Bowl.<ref name=MITA>{{cite news |author= Staff |date= Summer 2007 |title= MITA Presents Michigan Construction Quality Partnership Awards |url= http://www.mi-ita.com/Portals/0/pdf%20files/CQP_Article.pdf |format= PDF |work= Cross-Section |publisher= Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association |page= 11 |accessdate= August 30, 2012}}</ref> This interchange is spans over {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} near the [[American Center]].

Northwest of this interchange, M-10 transitions to a [[boulevard]] with [[Michigan left]]s. Called just Northwestern Highway, M-10 runs through suburban residential areas of Southfield. At the intersection with Inkster Road, the highway clips the southwest corner of the city of [[Franklin, Michigan|Franklin]] and enters the northeastern corner of [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington Hills]]. The roadway is lined with commercial properties while just behind them are residential subdivisions and two golf courses. At the intersection with 14&nbsp;Mile Road, Northwestern Highway crosses into [[West Bloomfield Township, Michigan|West Bloomfield Township]], and {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} further on, the highway ends at Orchard Lake Road.<ref name=MDOT14D/><ref name=google/>

Starting in 1924, officials in southeastern Michigan proposed building a highway from Detroit to run northwesterly across the state to [[Ludington, Michigan|Ludington]], bisecting the angle created by [[Woodward Avenue|Woodward]] and [[Grand River Avenue|Grand River]] avenues. This roadway was named Northwestern Highway when it was built in 1929 to an endpoint at 14&nbsp;Mile Road. Further construction on Northwestern Highway was halted by the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=barnett>{{cite book |last= Barnett |first= LeRoy |year= 2004 |title= A Drive Down Memory Lane: The Named State and Federal Highways of Michigan |location= Allegan Forest, MI |publisher= Priscilla Press |pages= 116<U+2013>17, 121 |isbn= 1-886167-24-9}}</ref>

The freeway segment northwest of Wyoming Avenue to the county line was previously known as James Couzens Highway after the street it replaced. That street was named after the death of [[James J. Couzens]]. Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit's [[Department of Street Railways]] from 1913 through 1915, after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918. He was [[Mayor of Detroit]] from 1919 until 1922 and [[United States congressional delegations from Michigan|United States Senator from Michigan]] from 1922 until his death on October 22, 1936. During his years of public service, he is said not to have accepted a salary, giving it all to charity. After his death, Detroit renamed its section of Northwestern Highway after Couzens.<ref name=barnett/>

[[John C. Lodge]] was a a member of the constitutional convention which drafted the Michigan Constitution of 1908, a former member of the [[Michigan Legislature]] and Detroit alderman and councilman. He later served as Mayor of Detroit in 1918<U+2013>1919 before returned to the City Common Council from 1932 to 1947. He was then elected to the Wayne County Board of Supervisors from 1948 until 1950. In total, he held elective office longer than anyone in city history. He died on February 6, 1950, and the future Lodge Freeway was named in his honor on January 20, 1953.<ref name=barnett/> The entire freeway, including segments previously named for James Couzens and the Northwestern Highway was named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987, although the service drives retained their original names.<ref>{{cite web |first= Caitlin |last= Brennecke |date= n.d. |title= John C.
