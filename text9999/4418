The '''X1''' is a fast, light-weight sailing dinghy designed for sailing on rivers, estuaries and inland waters by [[Phil Morrison (yachts)|Phil Morrison]]. The dinghy is sailed by 2 or 3 people and has a [[mainsail|main]], a [[jib]] and a [[Spinnaker#Symmetric spinnakers|symmetric_spinnaker]]. The boat is designed to be easily driven in very light wind, easy to sail and rig and quick to tack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.x1riverboat.co.uk|title= www.x1riverboat.co.uk|publisher=www.x1riverboat.co.uk|accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref> It has a PY of 949.{{Cite web|url=http://www.rya.org.uk/racing/Pages/portsmouthyardstick.aspx|title=RYA Portsmouth Yardstick|publisher=RYA|accessdate=2011-03-22}}. Currently the PY is the same as an [[RS400]] but can perform better in light wind and slower in heavier winds.

The '''X0''' is a variant of the original X1 with the same hull etc. but a smaller rig. The mast and three sails are different and can easily be substituted. This version is intended for beginners or lighter weight crew.
Differences in specification: Mast height: {{convert|6.62|m|abbr=on}}, Sail area - Main and Jib: {{convert|13.2|m|abbr=on}}, Sail area - Spinnaker: {{convert|11.5|m|abbr=on}}.
