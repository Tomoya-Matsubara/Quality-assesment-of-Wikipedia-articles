==Career==
Turnbull played for the University Football Club in the [[Western Australian Amateur Football League]] (WAAFL) in 1989 before making his debut for [[Claremont Football Club|Claremont]] in the WAFL midway through the season.<ref name="epfc"/> He played in Claremont's 1989 [[List of West Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] before being selected by the [[West Coast Eagles]] with a compensatory pre-[[1989 VFL Draft|draft]] selection, along with [[Peter Mann]]. In the 1990 season, he did not manage to break into West Coast's senior side and or hold his place in Claremont's side, but ended up playing in Claremont's 1990 reserves premiership. Turnbull switched to [[East Perth Football Club|East Perth]] in the WAFL for the 1991 season after a difference of opinion between Claremont coach [[Gerard Neesham]] and West Coast coach [[Michael Malthouse]] on how he was being played. Turnbull made his debut for West Coast in round 7 of the [[1991 AFL season|1991 season]], against {{AFL Haw}} at [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]], as the youngest member of the team, gathering nine disposals and effecting four hit-outs partnered with [[Dean Irving]].<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/games/1991/101819910504.html Hawthorn v West Coast], 4 May 1991 <U+2013> AFLTables.

Turnbull managed six games in [[1992 AFL season|1992]], including five of the Eagles' first seven, but was again kept out of the side by first-choice ruckman [[Paul Harding (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Harding]]. He did not play for the Eagles in [[1993 AFL season|1993]], mainly due to the form of Irving and Harding, but managed to win a second F. D. Book Medal. He was a favourite for the 1993 [[Sandover Medal]], but lost to [[Robbie West]], finishing seventh overall.<ref name="epfc"/> He broke into the Eagles' side in the [[1994 AFL season|1994 season]], playing in all 23 of the Eagles' games, including the [[1994 AFL Grand Final|1994 Grand Final]], which the Eagles won by 80 points.

He played the first game of the [[1996 AFL season|1996 season]], but was dropped for [[Jason Ball]]. He returned to the side in round 11 after kicking seven goals in seven games with East Perth, and played all but one of the Eagles' remaining games, filling in for the injured [[Glen Jakovich]] at [[centre half-back]].<ref>[http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/players/playerprofile/ryanturnbull/tabid/7302/playerid/15770/category/past/season/2011/selected/bio/default.aspx Ryan Turnbull player profile] <U+2013> westcoasteagles.com.au.

Turnbull did not play for the Eagles in the [[1999 AFL season|1999 season]], with Gardiner and [[Jason Ball]] the first-choice ruck combination. He played 17 games for East Perth in the WAFL, and was considered one of the favourites for the Sandover Medal, eventually losing to [[Gus Seebeck]] by one vote.<ref name="epfc"/><ref name="waflonline"/> He also won a third F. D. Book Medal as East Perth's best and fairest. Turnbull re-established himself in the Eagles' team for the [[2000 AFL season|2000 season]], playing all 22 games.
