The '''2005 United States Grand Prix''', was a [[Formula One]] motor race held on [[June 19]], [[2005]] at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]. It was the ninth race of the 2005 Formula One Season. Out of 20 cars entered for the race, only the six cars from the [[Bridgestone]]-shod teams ([[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[Minardi]] and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]) competed. The remaining fourteen entrants, all using [[Michelin]] tyres, retired after the parade lap due to safety concerns.

Following several tyre failures before the race, most spectacularly on [[Ralf Schumacher]]'s [[Toyota F1|Toyota]] during Friday practice, Michelin advised its seven customer teams that they could not safely race on the tyres provided for them. The [[FIA]], the sport's governing body, refused to allow a [[chicane]] to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres. The Michelin teams, unable to come to a compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate.

Of the six competitors, Ferrari's [[Michael Schumacher]] was the eventual winner. The result significantly boosted his championship standing, placing him third overall &mdash; no driver above him in the table took part in the race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4109556.stm  |title=Schumacher claims farcical US win |accessdate=2007-10-28 |date=19 June, 2005 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref> It also had a significant effect on the outcome of the 2005 Constructor's Championship; without the easy 18 points Ferrari gained from this race they almost certainly would have finished below Toyota in said Championship (in the end thanks to this race they finished 12 points ahead in 3rd).  The situation created enormous negative publicity for the sport of Formula One, especially in the United States, a market in which Formula One had struggled to establish itself over the preceding 20 years, leading some to label the race as '''Indygate'''.<ref>'Indygate<U+2019> lawsuit dismissed [http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=36315 www.itv-f1.com] Retrieved 25 March 2007</ref>

== Pre-race controversy ==
=== Toyota tyre failures ===
On Friday, [[June 17]] [[2005]], during the afternoon's practice session, [[Ralf Schumacher]] driving for [[Toyota F1|Toyota]], crashed heavily in Turn 13 of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] road course, apparently as a result of a left-rear tyre failure. Schumacher had crashed at high speed at Turn 13 the previous year while driving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team.<ref>"Double Toyota tyre failure worries Michelin."

The following day, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams &mdash; [[British American Racing|BAR]], [[McLaren]], [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]], [[Renault F1|Renault]], [[Toyota F1|Toyota]], [[Sauber]], and [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] &mdash; had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its [[Clermont-Ferrand]] headquarters.<ref>Michelin looking to fly in new tyres [http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=33173 www.-itv-f1.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the [[2005 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]] earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}<!--<ref name="Stoddart's Comments">Stoddart comments on US Grand Prix [http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=189438&FS=F1 www.motorsport.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>-->

=== Correspondence between Michelin and the FIA ===
In a letter to FIA Race Director [[Charlie Whiting]], dated Saturday, [[June 18]], Michelin representatives [[Pierre Dupasquier]] and Nick Shorrock revealed that they did not know the cause of the Toyota tyre failures, and unless the cars could be slowed down in Turn 13, the Michelin tyres used in qualification could not be used during the race.
Whiting replied on Sunday, [[June 19]], expressing his surprise that Michelin had not brought suitable tyres, suggesting that the teams should limit their drivers to the maximum safe speed specified by Michelin in Turn 13. He also addressed several solutions which had been proposed by the teams, insisting that use of the new specification tyres flown in overnight would be " a breach of the rules to be considered by the stewards", and the placement of a [[chicane]] in the turn was "out of the question" &mdash; the race would not be sanctioned by the [[FIA]] (making it a non-championship race) if the track layout was changed. He deemed the Michelin teams' proposals to be "grossly unfair" to the [[Bridgestone]] teams.<ref name="letters">Letters between representatives of Michelin and Charlie Whiting, the FIA Formula One Race Director [http://www.newsonf1.net/2005/news/06/jun19fia.htm www.newsonf1.net] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>
[[Image:Tyre carts on grid at USGP 2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tire|Tyre]] issues caused the race to be run with only six competitors]]
In a second letter, also dated [[June 19]], Dupasquier and Shorrock confirmed that they would not permit their teams to race on the Michelin tyres used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which is permitted if a driver's safety is at issue.<ref>Further correspondence between representatives of Michelin in Indianapolis and the FIA Formula One Race Director [http://www.newsonf1.net/2005/news/06/jun19fia1.htm www.newsonf1.net] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>

=== Attempts at compromise ===
[[Paul Stoddart]], then owner of the [[Minardi]], a team using Bridgestone tyres, published an account on Wednesday, [[June 22]], of the events leading up to the race. Stoddart recorded a meeting around 10:00am on the day of the race, to which Speedway president [[Tony George]], "the two most senior Michelin representatives present at the circuit", [[Bernie Ecclestone]] (president and [[CEO]] of [[Formula One Management]] and [[Formula One Administration]]), the team principals, and the teams' Michelin technical representatives were summoned. All invited were present except [[Jean Todt]], Team Principal of [[Scuderia Ferrari]].<ref name="Stoddart's Comments" />
[[Image:Alonso (Renault) qualifying at USGP 2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Alonso qualifying for the race.]]
By Stoddart's account, the meeting proceeded as follows: The Michelin representatives stated their position that the tyres provided to the teams could not safely complete the race distance, and requested that the Bridgestone teams, represented by Stoddart and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]'s [[Colin Kolles]], permit the installation of a chicane in Turn 13. Those present discussed and agreed to reject the FIA's solution of speed-limiting the Michelin cars in the turn because of the potential for accidents. They likewise dismissed the possibility of making pit stops every ten laps, resolved that a chicane was the best solution, and instructed several technical representatives <!-- Stoddart's actual description was "a technical representative with specific knowledge of the Indianapolis circuit, together with representatives from IMS", so the first might have been non-IMS personnel --> to prepare plans for its installation. Bernie Ecclestone volunteered to consult Todt, who had not come to the meeting, and the president of the FIA, [[Max Mosley]], who was not present at the race, and reconvene the meeting when he had responses.<ref name="Stoddart's Comments">Stoddart comments on US Grand Prix [http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=189438&FS=F1 www.motorsport.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>
[[Image:Ralf Schumacher cropped.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Ralf Schumacher at an autograph session before the practice session where the Turn 13 accident occurred.]]
Ecclestone returned at about 10:55 to inform the group that Todt had refused to agree to the chicane, maintaining that it was an FIA and a Michelin problem and not his. By the time Stoddart's account of the meeting was published, Todt had already denied that he had ever been consulted, but stated that, if asked, he would not have agreed to the chicane.<ref>Todt:Chicane plan was 'ridiculous' [http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=33217 www.itv-f1.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> Furthermore, Ecclestone reported that "Mr Mosley had stated that if any attempts were made to alter the circuit, he would cancel the Grand Prix forthwith".<ref name="Stoddart's Comments" />

=== Team principals' plan ===
[[Image:Zonta (Toyota) qualifying at USGP 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|As [[Ralf Schumacher]] was injured [[Ricardo Zonta]] qualified the [[Toyota F1|Toyota]] instead of him.]]
The group, according to Stoddart, continued to propose alternate solutions, including "a non-championship race, or a race in which the Michelin teams could not score points, and even a race whereby only the Michelin teams used the new chicane", but eventually agreed that the best option was to install the chicane and run a non-championship race, without Ferrari if necessary.<ref name="non-FIA USGP plan">Nine of ten teams had planned for non-FIA USGP. [http://www.crash.net/news_view.asp?cid=0&id=113472 www.crash.com] Retrieved 2 November 2006</ref> To ignore the FIA's instructions and carry on the race would have resulted in the FIA's withdrawing its staff, so the group appointed delegates to fill the various offices, including a race director to replace Charlie Whiting and a safety car driver to replace [[Bernd Maylander]]. The team principals were instructed to convey to their teams and drivers that, in the absence of FIA scrutineers and equipment, the technical rules could not be enforced, and that they were to conduct themselves honourably and in the interest of an entertaining race.<ref name="non-FIA USGP plan" />

They proceeded to summon the twenty drivers and present their plan. Of the drivers' opinions, Stoddart writes: "While I cannot testify that each and every driver agreed with what we were proposing, what I can say with certainty is that no driver disagreed." The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present. The nine present team principals thereupon resolved that, unless they and the FIA could come to a decision in the interest of the sport, they would not participate in the race.<ref name="non-FIA USGP plan" /> 
[[Image:GrandPrix Circuit US 2005 Turn13.svg|thumb|200px|Turn 13, the centre of the controversy.]]
After a short break, the group gathered again in Ecclestone's office to find Renault team principal [[Flavio Briatore]] on the phone with Max Mosley. Mosley had apparently rejected all of their proposals, and indeed "it was stated that Mosley had informed Mr Martin, the FIA's most senior representative in the USA, that if any kind of non-championship race was run, or any alteration made to the circuit, the US Grand Prix, and indeed, all FIA-regulated motorsport in the US, would be under threat".<ref name="Stoddart's Comments" /> On the same day that Stoddart's version of events was published, the FIA issued a statement denying that Mosley had made the reported threat, or that any such conversation had taken place.<ref>FIA denies Stoddart claim [http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns15088.html www.grandprix.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>

Having exhausted their options, the Michelin team principals, Stoddart, and Bernie Ecclestone &mdash; but not Jordan's Colin Kolles &mdash; discussed whether their cars should proceed to the grid, and decided that they should participate in the formation lap but that they could not race.<ref name="Stoddart's Comments" />  Stoddart asked Kolles if he would be entering his cars and was informed that Jordan would indeed be racing, despite having previously agreed not to. Stoddart was then approached by a Bridgestone representative and told that Bridgestone wanted him to race; He has also stated that given his "current relationship with Mr Mosley, [he] felt certain heavy sanctions would follow if [he] did not [race]." Stoddart too decided to enter his drivers, but reported that he would retire them if the Jordans did not finish the race.<ref name="non-FIA USGP plan" />

== Race report ==
[[Image:Schumacher (Ferrari) in practice at USGP 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|Ferrari's [[Michael Schumacher]] (here pictured in qualifying) took his first, and only, win of the season.]]

At the start of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per [[Formula One regulations#Race procedure|FIA race procedure]]. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the formation lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams ([[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]], and [[Minardi]]) to start the race.<ref name="crashreport">Schumacher takes hollow USGP victory.[http://www.crash.net/news_view.asp?cid=1&id=113296 www.crash.net] Retrieved 30 November 2006</ref>

The move by the teams, to come to the grid and then pull out after the formation lap into the pits, infuriated the fans, as they had little idea what was happening. Loud boos were heard and some threw items on the track. US broadcaster [[Speed Channel]]'s [[Peter Windsor]] was only able to report the details of the situation shortly after the race had started. The race quickly turned into a two horse Ferrari race, with the Italian team's Michael Schumacher and [[Rubens Barrichello]] in front, Jordan's [[Tiago Monteiro]] and [[Narain Karthikeyan]] in a distant third and fourth, and Minardi's [[Christijan Albers]] and [[Patrick Friesacher]] bringing up the rear. 

The race was a story of pit strategy, as the only passing on the circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane at the same time as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not investigated by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field.<ref name="crashreport" /> All six starters finished the race, only the third time in Formula One history when every car that started a race went on to complete it. Neither Minardi nor Jordan had been competitive in 2005, and all four of their drivers scored their first points in Formula One at this race.

At the podium ceremony, at which none of the scheduled presenters were present, all Ferrari team members quietly accepted their awards, and quickly exited. However, Monteiro stayed behind to celebrate his first podium finish, and the first for a Portuguese driver.<ref name="crashreport" />

== Aftermath ==
[[Image:Blame Mosley banner.jpg|thumb|250px|Disgruntled fans blaming [[FIA]] president [[Max Mosley]] for the events of the race]]

The win, Schumacher's only victory of 2005, ended the second-longest non-winning streak of his career and moved him from fifth to third in the drivers championship. Rubens Barrichello moved from sixth to fourth, and the Ferrari team moved from fifth to second in the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors Championship]]. Both Jordan and Minardi scored points, leaving BAR-Honda as the only team not to have scored any points up to that stage of the season. However, these changes in the championship standings were dwarfed by the recriminations over the failure to find a solution which have would allowed the Michelin-shod teams to race.

Bernie Ecclestone, in answer to a question by [[ITV]]'s [[Martin Brundle]] in an interview just before the start of the race, described the future of Formula One in the [[United States]] and the future of Michelin in the sport as "not good". He also said that the "incident's not the fault of the teams, to be honest with you."<ref>Brundle vs Bernie [http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=General&PO_ID=33229 www.itv-f1.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>

Many people involved in F1 labelled the race a "[[farce]]" and questioned whether a United States Grand Prix would be held again at Indianapolis, or at any other [[United States|American]] venue ever again for that matter. David Coulthard said, "It throws into doubt the future of the race in US".<ref>Day of shame for F1 [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/06/20/smgars20.xml www.telegraph.co.uk] Retrieved 29 November 2006</ref> Some pointed to the previous disagreements between the teams and Max Mosley (which had led to the threatened creation of the [[GPWC]] as an alternative to Formula One) as a critical factor in the failure to reach a compromise and felt that the events at this race had greatly increased the risk of a complete rupture.<ref>James Allen's verdict [http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=James_Allen&PO_ID=33214 www.itv-f1.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>

Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said immediately after the race that nine teams &mdash; all but Ferrari &mdash; agreed not to race, and had Jordan not reversed its decision at the last minute, Minardi would also have [[boycott]]ed the race.<ref>Angry Stoddart criticises Jordan [http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=33187 www.itv-f1.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, for the benefit of the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) at the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.<ref>Stoddart: What really happened at Indy...[http://www.crash.net/feature_view~cid~1~id~7687~pid~5.htm www.crash.net] Retrieved 29 November 2006</ref>

=== FIA's reaction ===
The following day, the FIA published a justification  of its refusal to permit a change in tyres or the installation of a chicane.<ref>2005 United States Grand Prix [http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2005/June/200605-01.html www.fia.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> The FIA also summoned the seven Michelin-shod teams before the [[World Motorsport Council]] at their headquarters in France, for a hearing on June 29, to explain their failure to participate, by which they had presumably violated the terms of the [[Concorde Agreement]].<ref>FIA World Motorsport Council [http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2005/June/200605-02.html www.fia.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> It later published copies of the letters sent to each team "in the interests of transparency".<ref>United States Grand Prix - World Motor Sport Council [http://www.newsonf1.net/2005/news/06/jun21fia.htm www.newsonf1.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>
They were charged with violating article 151c of the [[International Sporting Code]], which refers to ''acts prejudicial to the interests of competition or motorsport generally.''<ref>FIA charges Michelin teams [http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=33211 www.itv-f1.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> Specifically, it was charged that they had:
* ''Failed to ensure availability of suitable tyres for the race.''
* ''Wrongfully refused to allow cars to start the race''
* ''Wrongfully refused to allow cars to race subject to speed restrictions at one corner, which was safe for such tyres available.''
* ''Combined with other teams to make a demonstration damaging to the image of Formula 1 by pulling into the pits immediately before the start of the race.''
* ''Failed to notify the stewards of intention not to race.''

On [[June 22]] the FIA produced a press release from Max Mosley, in the form of a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy.<ref>Mosley comments on US Grand Prix [http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=189457 www.motorsport.com]Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.

On [[June 29]] the FIA World Motorsport Council found the teams guilty on the first two counts, that is, ''of not being in possession of suitable tyres for the event, but with strong mitigating circumstances'', and that of ''wrongfully refusing to allow their cars to start the race''. The teams were found not guilty of the other three counts. The punishment, however, was not decided, and was not to have been announced until [[September 14]].<ref>World Motor Sport Council Hearing of the Michelin Formula One teams decision [http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2005/June/290605-03.html www.fia.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>

On [[July 22]], the FIA World Motorsport Council voted to overturn its previous decision, and exonerated the Michelin teams of all charges. The decision was due to "evidence previously submitted to the FIA Senate",<ref>FIA World Motor Sport Council decision [http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2005/July/220705-01.html www.fia.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> rumoured to be that the Michelin teams could have been held accountable under [[Indiana]] state law for knowingly putting others at risk if they had raced.<ref>Michelin teams exonerated on Indy [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4683483.stm news.bbc.co.uk] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref>

===Compensation===
On [[June 28]], Michelin announced that it would offer compensation to all race fans who had purchased tickets for the Grand Prix.<ref>Official: Michelin to reimburse Indy race fans [http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=24982 www.pitpass.com] Retrieved 5 August 2006</ref> By the end of September, the company had issued refund cheques through the Speedway ticket office for the price of all tickets for the race. Additionally, Michelin purchased 20,000 tickets for the [[2006 United States Grand Prix]] to be distributed to spectators who renewed their 2005 ticket orders for the event, two additional tickets per order.<ref>Michelin pleased with dismissed Indy lawsuit [http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/19062006/13/michelin-pleased-dismissed-indy-lawsuit.html uk.sports.yahoo.com] Retrieved 29 November 2006</ref>

In addition to the refunded tickets, there was some discussion about holding a second, non-championship race at Indianapolis. On [[July 2]], at the [[2005 French Grand Prix]], [[McLaren]] team principal [[Ron Dennis]] suggested that an additional race could be held at the American circuit after the last official race of the season, in [[2005 Chinese Grand Prix|Shanghai]]. The teams had, apparently, already discussed the idea with [[Bernie Ecclestone]]. But the next day [[Tony George]] dismissed the possibility: "There will be no race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway this fall."<ref>Tony George says "No" [http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns15171.html www.grandprix.com] Retrieved 7 December 2006</ref> At the 2005 [[Champ Car World Series]] [[Grand Prix of Cleveland]], held one week after the US Grand Prix, free admission was granted to all bearers of ticket stubs of the US Grand Prix.<ref>Champ Car to honour US GP tickets in Cleveland.[http://www.crash.net/news_view.asp?cid=3&id=113349 www.crash.net] Retrieved 2 November 2006</ref>

== Notes ==
* All six starters finished the race, making this only the third time in Formula One history where every car that started a race went on to complete it.
* [[Ralf Schumacher]] had a large crash during Friday's practice session, he was out of this grand prix and replaced by [[Ricardo Zonta]].
* This was [[Ricardo Zonta]]'s only "race" of the season.
* [[Michael Schumacher]]'s only victory of 2005 ended the second-longest non-winning streak of his career.
* Jordan driver Tiago Monteiro's third place earned him the first podium finish of his career, and the first podium for a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] driver.
*[[Narain Karthikeyan]] became the first [[India]]n driver to score points at a Formula 1 race.
*[[Christijan Albers]] and [[Patrick Friesacher]] scored points for the first time.
*This race saw both [[Minardi]] drivers score points for the last time. 
*This race also saw [[Minardi]] car(s) score point(s) for the final time.
*Unlike European F1 races, the GP2 class did not race.  Instead, Porsche Supercup, Formula BMW, and Indy Pro Series races were held at the track for undercard events.  Notably, [[Marco Andretti]] won the [[Indy Pro Series]] race held after F1 qualifying.
