'''Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher'''<!-- ''not'' "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven" --> [[Order of the Garter|LG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (born 13 October 1925) served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1979 to 1990 and [[Leader of the Conservative Party|Leader]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from 1975 to 1990. She is the only woman to have held either post.<ref name="number-10">{{cite web|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/margaret-thatcher|title=Margaret Thatcher, 10 Downing Street|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref>

Born in [[Grantham]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]], she read chemistry at [[Somerville College, Oxford]] and later trained as a [[barrister]]. She won a seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]], becoming the MP for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] as a Conservative. When [[Edward Heath]] formed a government in 1970, he appointed Thatcher [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Science]]. Four years later, she backed [[Keith Joseph]] in his bid to become Conservative Party leader but he was forced to drop out of the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|election]]. In 1975 Thatcher entered the contest herself and became leader of the Conservative Party. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] she became Britain's first female Prime Minister. 

In her foreword to the 1979 Conservative manifesto, Thatcher had written of "a feeling of helplessness, that a once great nation has somehow fallen behind."<ref>{{cite web|title=Conservative Party Manifesto 1979|url=http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml|last=Thatcher|first=Margaret (Foreword)|work=http://www.conservativemanifesto.com|publisher=http://www.politicalstuff.co.uk|year=2001|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref> She entered [[10 Downing Street]] determined to reverse what she perceived as a precipitate national decline, characterised by a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and stagnant or slow growth. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation, particularly of the financial sector, flexible labour markets, and the selling off of [[Government-owned corporation|state owned companies]]. Amid a recession and high unemployment, Thatcher's popularity decreased, though economic recovery and the 1982 [[Falklands War]] brought a resurgence of support and she was re-elected in 1983. She took a hard line against trade unions, survived the [[Brighton hotel bombing]] assassination attempt and opposed the [[Soviet Union]] (her tough-talking rhetoric gained her the nickname the "[[Iron Lady]]"); she was re-elected for an unprecedented third term in 1987. The following years would prove difficult, as her [[Community Charge|Poll tax]] plan was largely unpopular, and her views regarding the [[European Union|European Community]] were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister in November 1990 after [[Michael Heseltine]]'s challenge to her [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|leadership of the Conservative Party]]. 

Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister was the longest since that of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and the longest continuous period in office since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in the early 19th century.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |last= HM Government| first=|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1953/press.html |title=Margaret Thatcher, 10 Downing Street |accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref> She was the first woman to lead a major political party in the [[United Kingdom]], and the first of only three women to hold any of the four [[great offices of state]]. She holds a [[life peerage]] as Baroness Thatcher, of [[Kesteven]] in the County of Lincolnshire, which entitles her to sit in the [[House of Lords]].

Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on 13 October 1925 to [[Alfred Roberts]], originally from [[Northamptonshire]], and his wife, the former Beatrice Ethel Stephenson from [[Lincolnshire]].<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 1</ref><ref>Maurice Crittenden, a British journalist, in ''The Sunday Times'', Oct. 24, 1998, stated that one of Lady Thatcher's political allies, Labour politician [[Woodrow Wyatt]], believed Beatrice Stephenson was the illegitimate daughter of society figure [[Harry Cust]] and his married servant Phoebe Stephenson (n<U+00E9>e Crust, Mrs Daniel Stephenson). One of Cust's known illegitimate children was [[Lady Diana Cooper]], who knew of the rumor and reportedly found it amusing to refer to Prime Minister Thatcher as her niece (John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher'', Jonathan Cape, 2000, Volume I, page 5). The Cust-Roberts story was restated by Crittenden in an article published in 2006 and accessible at the website of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110880</ref> Thatcher spent her childhood in the town of [[Grantham]] in Lincolnshire, where her father owned two grocery shops.<ref name="MT biography">{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/essential/biography.asp|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation}}</ref> She and her older sister Muriel (born 1921, Grantham;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk|title=Births England and Wales 1837-1983}}</ref> died December 2004; married name Cullen)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20051016/ai_n15710965|title=Independent diary}} <!-- {{Dead link|date=July 2009}} --> </ref> were raised in the flat above the larger of the two located near the railway line.<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 3</ref> Her father was active in local politics and religion, serving as an [[Alderman]] and [[Methodist]] lay preacher. He came from a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] family but stood<U+2014>as was then customary in local government<U+2014>as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. He lost his post as Alderman in 1952 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 8</ref>

Margaret Roberts was brought up a strict [[Methodist]] by her father.<ref name="Johnson">Maureen Johnson, "Bible-Quoting Thatcher Stirs Furious Debate", ''The Associated Press'' (28 May 1988).</ref> Having attended Huntingtower Road Primary School, she won a scholarship to [[Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School]].<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 5</ref> Her school reports show hard work and commitment, but not brilliance.

At Oxford she read [[Friedrich von Hayek]]'s recently published (1944) ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]''. " I cannot claim that I fully grasped the implications of Hayek's little masterpiece at this time, [but] at this stage it was the..unanswerable criticisms of socialism in ''The Road to Serfdom'' which had an impact." In 1946 Roberts took the [[Final Honour School]] examination, graduating with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class]] [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. She subsequently studied crystallography and received a postgraduate [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in 1947. Three years later, in 1950, she achieved a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] advanced degree, according to her entitlement as an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] of seven years' standing since [[Matriculation#United Kingdom|matriculation]].<ref name="MT biography"/>

Following graduation, Roberts moved to Colchester in Essex, to work as a research chemist for [[BX Plastics]].<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 17</ref> During this time she joined the local [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Association]] and attended the party conference at Llandudno in 1948, as a representative of the University Graduate Conservative Association.<ref name = "Brackett-p22">Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 22</ref> She was also a member of the [[Association of Scientific Workers]]. In January 1949, a friend from Oxford, who was working for the [[Dartford]] Conservative Association, told her that they were looking for candidates.<ref name = "Brackett-p22"/> After a brief period, she was selected as the Conservative candidate, and she subsequently moved to Dartford, Kent, to stand for election as a Member of Parliament. To support herself during this period, she went to work for [[J. Lyons and Co.]], where she helped develop methods for preserving ice cream and was paid <U+00A3>500 per year.<ref name = "Brackett-p22"/>

== Early political career (1950<U+2013>1970) ==

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 and]] [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 elections]], she fought the safe Labour seat of [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]].<ref name="MT biography"/> Although she lost out to [[Norman Dodds]], she reduced the Labour majority in the constituency by 6,000.<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 24</ref> She was, at the time, the youngest ever female Conservative candidate and her campaign attracted a higher than normal amount of media attention for a first time candidate.<ref name="MT biography"/><ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 23</ref> While active in the Conservative Party in Kent, she met [[Denis Thatcher]], whom she married in 1951,<ref name="Denis Thatcher">{{cite news|title=Sir Denis Thatcher Bt|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article36663.ece|accessdate=2007-12-09|date=2003-06-23|work=The Independent}}</ref> conforming to his [[Church of England|Anglicanism]].<ref>Thatcher, ''Path to Power'', p. 105.</ref> Denis was a wealthy divorced businessman who ran his family's firm;<ref name="Denis Thatcher"/> he later became an executive in the oil industry.<ref name="MT biography"/> Denis funded his wife's studies for the [[Barrister|Bar]].<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 25</ref> She qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation.<ref name="MT biography"/> In the same year her twin children [[Carol Thatcher|Carol]] and [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]] were born,<ref name = "Beckett-p26">Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 26</ref> delivered by [[Caesarean section]] while their father watched a [[Test cricket|Test match]] at [[the Oval]]. With a mother climbing the political ladder, the children were left to a [[nanny]]. "My mother was prone to calling me by her secretaries' names and working through each of them until she got to Carol," recalled her daughter.<ref> ''The Observer'' Profile, ''Carol Thatcher'' 27 November 2005</ref>

Thatcher began to look for a safe Conservative seat in the mid-1950s and was narrowly rejected as candidate for the [[Orpington by-election, 1955|Orpington by-election]] in 1955, and was not selected as a candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 election]].<ref name="Beckett-p26"/> She had several further rejections before being selected for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in April 1958. She won the seat after hard campaigning during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 election]] and was elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP).<ref>Beckett, Clare (2006), p. 27 See also: {{London Gazette|issue=41842|startpage=6433|date=13 October 1959|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Her [[maiden speech]] was in support of her [[Private Member's Bill]] ([[Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960]]) requiring local councils to hold meetings in public, which was successful. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of [[birching]] <ref>Campbell  p 134</ref>.

Within two years, in October 1961, she was given a promotion to the front bench as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions|Parliamentary Undersecretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance]].<ref name="chron">{{cite web|title=Brief chronology 1925-90|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/essential/chronology.asp#chron51|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation}}</ref> She held this post throughout the administration of [[Harold Macmillan]], until the Conservatives were removed from office in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]].<ref name="MT biography"/> When [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] stepped down, Thatcher voted for [[Edward Heath]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1965|leadership election of 1965]] over [[Reginald Maudling]].<ref>Wapshott, Nicholas (2007), p. 63</ref> She was promoted to the position of Conservative spokesman on Housing and Land; in this position, she advocated the Conservative policy of allowing tenants to buy their [[council house]]s.<ref name="ns64">Wapshott, Nicholas (2007), p. 64</ref> The policy would prove to be popular.<ref>''The Hot Seat'', James Allason, Blackthorn, London 2006</ref> She moved to the Shadow [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] team in 1966. As Treasury spokesman, she opposed Labour's mandatory price and income controls, which she argued would produce contrary effects to those intended and distort the economy.<ref name="ns64"/>

Thatcher established herself as a potent conference speaker at the Conservative Party Conference of 1966, with a strong attack on the high-tax policies of the Labour Government as being steps "not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism".<ref name="ns64"/> She argued that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work.<ref name="ns64"/> Thatcher was one of few Conservative MPs to support [[Leo Abse]]'s Bill to decriminalise male homosexuality and voted in favour of [[David Steel]]'s Bill to legalise abortion,<ref>Thatcher, ''Path to Power'', p. 150.</ref> as well as a ban on [[hare coursing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acigawis.co.uk/awisreview.html|title=Animal Welfare Information Service}}</ref><ref>"Hare coursing attack; League Against Cruel Sports", ''The Times'' (28 February 1989).</ref> She supported the retention of capital punishment and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws.<ref>Thatcher, ''Path to Power'', p. 151.</ref>

In 1967 she was selected by the [[Embassy of the United States in London]] to participate in the [[International Visitor Leadership Program]] (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a professional exchange program in which she spent about six weeks visiting various U.S. cities, political figures, and institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Scott-Smith |first= Giles |title= [http://www.nciv.org/media/article_thatcher.pdf "Her Rather Ambitious Washington Program": Margaret Thatcher's International Visitor Program Visit to the United States in 1967] |year= 2003 |publisher= Roosevelt Study Center |month= Winter |format = PDF}}</ref> Later that year, Thatcher joined the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] as Shadow Fuel spokesman. Shortly preceding the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], she was promoted to Shadow Transport and, finally, Education.<ref>Wapshott, Nicholas (2007), p. 65</ref>

== Education Secretary (1970<U+2013>1974) ==

When the Conservative party under [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, Thatcher became [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Science]]. In her first months in office, Thatcher came to public attention as a result of the administration of Edward Heath's decision to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools,<ref name="ear14"/> and imposed public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in, against her private protests, the abolition of free milk for school-children aged seven to eleven.<ref name="ns76">Wapshott, Nicholas (2007), p. 76</ref> She believed that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk, however she agreed to give younger children a third of a pint, daily, for nutritional purposes.<ref name="ns76"/> This provoked a storm of protest from the Labour party and the press,<ref name="ear15">Reitan, E.A. (2003), p. 15</ref> and led to the unflattering moniker "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher".<ref name="ns76"/> Of the experience, Thatcher later wrote in her autobiography, "I learned a valuable lesson. I had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit."<ref name="ear15"/>

She successfully resisted the introduction of library book charges. She did not volunteer spending cuts in her department, contrary to her later beliefs.<ref name="ns76"/> Her term was marked by support for several proposals for more local education authorities to close [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]] and to adopt [[comprehensive school|comprehensive secondary education]]. Thatcher, committed to a tiered [[secondary modern]] / grammar school system of education, was determined to preserve grammar schools, which prepared more students for admission to universities.<ref name="ear14">Reitan, E.A. (2003), p. 14</ref> She abolished Labour's commitment to comprehensive schooling, and instead left the matter to local education authorities.<ref name="ear14"/>

== Leader of the Opposition (1975<U+2013>1979) ==
[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white photo of Thatcher in a light coloured raincoat, sitting in a comfortable chair.|Margaret Thatcher elected as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] on 18 September 1975.]]

The Heath government experienced many difficulties between 1970 and 1974.<ref name="MT biography"/> The government executed a series of reversals in its economic policies, dubbed "U-turns".<ref name="MT biography"/> The Conservatives were defeated in the February [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|1974 general election]], and Thatcher's portfolio was changed to Shadow Environment Secretary.<ref name="chron"/> In this position she promised to abolish the [[Poll tax#United Kingdom|rating system]] that paid for local government services, which was a favoured policy proposal within the Conservative Party for many years.<ref>Thatcher, ''Path to Power'', pp. 247-8.</ref>

Thatcher thought that the Heath Government had lost control of [[monetary policy]]<U+2014>and had lost direction.<ref>Thatcher, ''Path to Power'', pp. 219, 261.</ref> After her party lost the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|second election of 1974]] in October, Thatcher, determined to change the direction of the Conservative party, challenged Heath for the Conservative party leadership.<ref name="ear16">Reitan, E.A. (2003), p. 16</ref> She promised a fresh start, and her main support came from the Conservative [[1922 Committee]].<ref name="ear16"/> Unexpectedly, she [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|defeated Heath]] on the first ballot, and he resigned the leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article545321.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2|title=Thatcher leads tributes to Sir Edward Heath|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=2008-10-14|work=The Times of London|Naughton, Philippe}}</ref> On the second ballot, she defeated Heath's preferred successor, [[William Whitelaw]], and became Conservative Party leader on 11 February 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102452|title=Press Conference after winning Conservative leadership (Grand Committee Room)|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> She appointed Whitelaw as her deputy. Heath remained disenchanted with Thatcher to the end of his life for what he, and many of his supporters, perceived as her disloyalty in standing against him.<ref>{{cite news|title=For British Tories, a Private Feud Goes Public|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DC173CF936A15754C0A96E948260|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-14|date=25 July 1988|author=Weinraub, Bernard}}</ref>

Now that the Heath government had fallen, Thatcher, "renewed [her] reading of the seminal works of liberal economics and conservative thought. I also regularly attended lunches at the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] where [[Ralph Harris, Baron Harris of High Cross|Ralph Harris]], [[Arthur Seldon]] and all those who had been right, when we in Government had gone so badly wrong..were busy ''marking out a new path for Britain''. "  (The IEA,  a think tank founded by the  poultry magnate [[Antony Fisher]], the man who brought [[battery farming]] to Britain and a disciple of [[Friedrich von Hayek]],  had become the ideas factory of a new British Conservatism. Thatcher began visiting the IEA and reading its publications during the early sixties.) Thatcher would now become the face of the ideological movement that felt the opposite of reverence for the [[welfare state]] [[Keynesian]] economics  they believed was ''terminally weakening'' Britain.  " Whatever the question the institute's pamphlets posed, their answer was basicaly identical: less government, lower taxes, more freedom for business and consumers." <ref> Andy Beckett ''When the Lights Went Out'' chapter 11 ''Margaret and the Austrians'' </ref>

In these years Thatcher began to work on her image, specifically her voice and screen image. "The hang-up has always been the voice" wrote the critic [[Clive James]], in ''[[The Observer]].'' "Not the timbre so much as, well, the ''tone'' - the condescending explanatory whine which treats the squirming interlocutor as an eight-year-old child with learning deficiencies. ''News Extra'' rolled a clip from May 1973 demonstrating the Thatcher sneer at full pitch. She sounded like a ''cat sliding down a blackboard''." She worked to change this image and James acknowledged: "She's ''cold'', ''hard'', quick and superior, and smart enough to know that those qualities could work ''for'' her instead of against." <ref> Clive James ''[[Visions Before Midnight]]'' p119-120 ISBN  0-330-26464-8</ref>

Thatcher appointed many of Heath's supporters to the Shadow Cabinet, for she had won the leadership as an outsider and then had little power base of her own within the party. Thatcher had to act cautiously to convert the Conservative Party to her [[monetarist]] beliefs. She reversed Heath's support for [[devolved government]] for [[Scotland]].

On 19 January 1976, she made a speech in Kensington Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the [[Soviet Union]]. The most famous part of her speech ran:

{{quote|The Russians are bent on world dominance, and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen. The men in the Soviet ''Politburo'' do not have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion.

In response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' (''Red Star'') gave her the nickname "[[Iron Lady]]".<ref name="ironlady">{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102939|title=<U+00AB> Britain Awake <U+00BB>|accessdate=2008-11-02|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation}}</ref> She took delight in the name and it soon became associated with her image as having an unwavering and steadfast character. She was later nicknamed "Attila the Hen" as well.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Malcolm Rifkind]] |title=Attila the Hen |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200005080049|work=New Statesman|date=8 May 2000|accessdate=2008-10-14}}</ref>

In an interview in January 1978,on the  television current-affairs programme ''[[World in Action]]'' Thatcher raised the prospect of the number of Pakistani and Commonwealth Britons doubling to four million by the end of the century, remarking: "People are really rather afraid that this country might be swamped by people with a different culture".<ref>Interview for Granada TV with journalist Gordon Burns (27 January 1978), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=103485 "TV Interview for Granada ''World in Action'' ('rather swamped')"], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved 5 January 2008.</ref> Thatcher was condemned for the language and content of her remarks by [[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] and [[Denis Healey|Healey]], by bishops, by the Liberal leader [[David Steel]] and, in private, by some shadow cabinet colleagues. [[Enoch Powell]] expressed his 'hope and relief' at her words.  "By the sixties and seventies, with British imperial pride receding fast and a debate about national decline established in its place, Commonwealth immigration could look, to a certain kind of British patriot, less like a healthy post-imperial exchange and more like a national defeat: an invasion of territory of the kind previously mounted by Britain against other states." <ref> Andy Beckett ''When the Lights went out'' p.442/443 </ref> Thatcher received 10,000 letters thanking her for raising the subject of immigration, and the Conservatives, previously level with Labour on 43% in opinion polls, took a 48% to 39% lead.<ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher: Volume One: The Grocer's Daughter'' (Jonathan Cape, 2000), p. 400.</ref> "Before my interview, the opinion polls showed us level-pegging with Labour.

In spite of  economic recovery in the late seventies and recovery in average disposable income from 1977 onwards, the Labour Government was faced with unease about the direction of the country, and eventually, 'a sudden nationwide revolt against the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]], during the winter of 1978<U+2013>79, popularly dubbed the "[[Winter of Discontent]]".  'Party in grip of mild euphoria,' wrote Thatcher's adviser [[John Hoskyns]] in his diary on 18 January, 'because country beset by strikes..' The Conservatives attacked the government's unemployment record, and used advertising hoardings with the slogan ''Labour Isn't Working'' to assist them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election2001/images/0,,449826,00.html|title=Tory Party Poster}}</ref> When the rough poster was shown to Thatcher,
"She stared at it for a long time; the convention in party propaganda was not to mention the opponent directly. 'Why is the biggest thing on the poster the name of the opposition? We're advertising Labour,' she said. Tim Bell (Saatchis managing director) and [[Maurice Saatchi]] replied, almost in unison, 'No, we're demolishing Labour.' "  [[Denis Healey]] criticised [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] for having staged the photograph with Saatchi employees.<ref> Andy Beckett ''When the Lights went out'' p.459 </ref> In fact the advertisers had used a group of twenty [[Young Conservatives]] from South Hendon "photographed over and over". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1222326.stm |title='Epoch-making' poster was clever fake |first=Chris |last=Horrie |date=16 March 2001 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>  The Saatchi campaign unsettled Labour at a crucial moment.

In the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]], most opinion polls showed that voters preferred [[James Callaghan]] of the Labour party as Prime Minister, even as the Conservative Party maintained a lead in the polls. After a successful [[1979 vote of no confidence against the government of James Callaghan|motion of no confidence in spring 1979]], Callaghan's Labour government fell. The Conservatives would go on to win a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons and Margaret Thatcher became the United Kingdom's first female Prime Minister.

Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the British Civil Service that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of Empire{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and she wanted the country to assert a higher level of influence and leadership in international affairs.

=== First government (1979<U+2013>1983) ===
==== New economic initiatives ====

Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised reduced state intervention, [[free market]]s, and entrepreneurialism.

At the time, some [[Edward Heath|Heathite]] Conservatives in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], the so-called "[[Wets & Dries|wets]]", expressed doubt over Thatcher's "[[Wets & Dries|dry]]" policies.<ref name="nft"/> Civil unrest in Britain resulted in the British media discussing the need for a policy [[u-turn]]. At the 1980 Conservative Party conference, Thatcher addressed the issue directly, armed with a speech written by the playwright Ronald Millar<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Bill|title=Politics UK|publisher=Longman|location=London|edition=6|page=224|chapter=Media organisations and the political process|isbn=1-4058-2411-5}}</ref> which included the lines: "You turn if you want to.

The term "[[Thatcherism]]" came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including moral absolutism, [[British nationalism|nationalism]], interest in the individual, and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.<ref name="eb"/> American author Claire Berlinski, who wrote the biography ''[[There Is No Alternative: Why Margaret Thatcher Matters]]'', argues repeatedly throughout the volume that it was this Thatcherism, specifically her focus on economic reform, that set the United Kingdom on the path to recovery and long term growth.

==== Northern Ireland ====
{{Main|1981 Irish hunger strike}}

The [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger strike]] was begun by a number of [[Provisional IRA]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] prisoners in [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze Prison]] to regain the status of political prisoners which had been revoked five years earlier under the preceding Labour government.<ref name="strike"/> [[Bobby Sands]] began the strike, saying that he would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over their living conditions.<ref name="strike">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/3/newsid_2451000/2451503.stm|accessdate=2008-11-01|date=3 October 1981|title=1981: IRA Maze hunger strikes at an end|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for the prisoners, famously declaring "Crime is crime is crime; it is not political"<ref name="strike"/> and felt that Britain should not negotiate with terrorists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n43_v12/ai_18850066|title=The legacy of Margaret Thatcher|accessdate=2008-11-01|date=18 November 1996|work=Insight on the News|author=Crabtreee, Susan and Tiffany Danitz}}</ref> However, despite holding this view in public, the British government made private contact with republican leaders in a bid to bring the hunger strikes to an end.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6036723.ece|title=Was Gerry Adams complicit over hunger strikers?|accessdate=2009-04-20|date=5 April 2009|author=Clarke, Liam}}</ref>  After nine more men had starved to death and the strike had ended, some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but official recognition of political status was not granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=5397|title=Maze hunger strike called off|date=3 October 1981|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher=History}}</ref>

Later that year, Thatcher and Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] established the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, which would act as a forum for meetings between the two governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/chronology.htm|title=The Hunger Strike of 1981- A Chronology of Main Events|publisher=CAIN|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> On 15 November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]; the first time a British government gave the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland.

==== The Falklands ====
{{Main|Falklands War}}
On 2 April 1982, the ruling military junta in [[Argentina]] invaded the [[Falkland Islands]] and South Georgia, British overseas territories that Argentina claimed.<ref name="global">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/malvinas.htm|title=Falklands/Malvinas War|accessdate=2008-10-29|date=27 April 2007|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref> The following day, Thatcher sent a naval task force to recapture the islands and eject the invaders.<ref name="global"/> The conflict escalated from there, evolving into an amphibious and ground combat operation.<ref name="global"/> Argentina surrendered on 14 June and the operation was hailed a great success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255 British servicemen and three Falkland Islanders. 649 Argentinians also died, half of them after the cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']] was torpedoed by [[HMS Conqueror (S48)|HMS ''Conqueror'']].<ref name=liberation>'The Falklands: 25 years since the Iron Lady won her war; Liberation Day', ''The Times'' (15 June 2007), p. 32.</ref> Victory in the [[South Atlantic]] brought a wave of patriotic enthusiasm and support for the government.<ref name="msn"/> Thatcher's personal approval rating rose from 30% to 59%, as measured by [[Mori]], and from 29% to 52%, according to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]].

On 26 July 1982, a service of thanksgiving for the victory was held in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], and the Archbishop of Canterury [[Robert Runcie]] delivered a sermon which asked the congregation to share the grief of both British and Argentinian mourners alike. Thatcher did not approve. Privately, according to an aide, she agreed with [[Edward du Cann]], [[Julian Amery]] and other Tory MPs who saw the Runcie sermon as proof that the Government still had many enemies who deserved denouncing. "Not the least of the Falklands after-effects was the start of a long, sometimes venomous distancing, which continued through the 1980s, between the leading representatives of Church and state.

==== 1983 election ====

Economic recovery from the spring of 1982 bolstered the Thatcher government's popularity,<ref name="msn"/> and although many contemporary commentators saw the ensuing [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|national poll]] as a [[khaki election]] that was decided by the "Falklands factor", the war had produced a disaggregated boost to Conservative support of no more than 3% for 3 months, suggesting Thatcher's sustained improvement was due instead to successful macroeconomic management.<ref>David Sanders, Hugh Ward, and David Marsh (with Tony Fletcher), "Government Popularity and the Falklands War: A Reassessment", ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 17, No. 3 (Jul., 1987), p. 28.</ref> She also faced a divided opposition: Labour was bitterly split;<ref name="msn"/> the party had responded to the [[Cold War (1979<U+2013>1985)|New Cold War]] by moving to the left and adopting a policy of [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]], and had lost many senior leaders to the new [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in alliance with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], preventing the formation of an electoral pact against the Conservatives.<ref name="ark"/> Labour leader [[Michael Foot]] was a left-winger and generally regarded as unelectable,<ref>Evans, Eric (2004), p. 23</ref> while Conservatives viewed Thatcher as 'their greatest electoral asset'.<ref>Toye, R. and Gottlieb, J.

=== Second government (1983<U+2013>1987) ===
==== Privatisation ====

The policy of [[privatisation]] has been called "a crucial ingredient of Thatcherism"<ref>Anthony Seldon and Daniel Collings, ''Britain under Thatcher'', London: Longman (2000), p. 27.</ref>. After the 1983 election the sale of large state utilities to private companies accelerated.<ref name="msn"/>

[[BP|British Petroleum]] was privatised in stages in October 1979, September 1983 and November 1987; [[British Aerospace]] in January 1981 and 1985; the government share in [[British Sugar]] in July 1981; [[Cable and Wireless]] in November 1981; [[Amersham International]] and [[National Freight Corporation]] in February 1982; [[Britoil]] in November 1982 and August 1985; [[Associated British Ports]] in February 1983; [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] in July 1984; [[British Telecom]] in November 1984; the [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]] in October 1986; [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] in December 1986; [[British Airways]] in February 1987; the [[Royal Ordnance]] in April 1987; [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] in May 1987; the [[British Airports Authority]] in July 1987; the [[British Leyland#Rover Group sale|Rover Group]] in August 1988; [[British Steel]] in December 1988; the [[Water privatisation in England|Regional Water Authorities]] in November 1989; [[Girobank]] in July 1990; and the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] in December 1990.

In 1983 Thatcher also broke up and privatised [[British Shipbuilders]], which had been amalgamated and nationalised by [[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] in 1977 in the lean times following the [[1973 oil crisis]], and which still employed 86,000 people building naval and commercial vessels, many in the north-east of England.<ref name=OConnell>Dominic O'Connell, "Parker leads British shipbuilding into battle", ''The Sunday Times'' (27 July 2008).</ref><ref name="ships">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/apr/14/china.internationalnews|title=China poised to rule the waves but fears are raised about quality of new vessels|author=Macalister, Terry|accessdate=2008-11-20|date=14 April 2006|work=The Guardian}}</ref> Few of the privatised shipyards subsequently survived competition against [[East Asian]] cheap labour,<ref name="ships"/> with the single largest private sector group, [[BVT Surface Fleet|BVT]], now employing a fraction of the nationalised group's number, just over 7,000 people working on [[Royal Navy|Navy]] contracts in the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] and [[Portsmouth]] yards.<ref name=OConnell/>

The process of privatisation, especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation, was associated with marked improvements in performance, particularly in terms of [[labour productivity]].<ref>David Parker and Stephen Martin, "The impact of UK privatisation on labour and total factor productivity", ''Scottish Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 42, Issue 2 (May 1995), p. 216.</ref> But it is not clear how far this can be attributed to the merits of privatisation itself. The "productivity miracle" observed in British industry under Thatcher was achieved not so much by increasing the overall productivity of labour as by reducing workforces and increasing unemployment.<ref>Andrew Glyn, 'The 'Productivity Miracle', Profits and Investment', in Jonathan Michie (ed.), ''The Economic Legacy, 1979-1992'', London: Academic Press (1992).</ref> A number of the privatised industries, such as gas, water and electricity, were [[natural monopolies]] for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. Furthermore, the privatised industries that underwent improvements often did so while still under state ownership. For instance, [[British Steel]] made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed chairmanship of [[Ian MacGregor]], who faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and more than halve the workforce.<ref>M. W. Kirby (2006) '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69687 MacGregor, Sir Ian Kinloch (1912<U+2013>1998)]', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, online edn., May 2006, accessed 24 November 2009 {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Regulation was also greatly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies like [[Ofgas]], [[Oftel]] and the [[National Rivers Authority]].<ref>Cento Veljanovski, 'The Political Economy of Regulation', in Patrick Dunleavy, Andrew Gamble and Gillian Peele (eds.), ''Developments in British Politics 3'', Basingstoke: Macmillan (1990), pp. 291-304.</ref> Overall, there was no clear pattern between the degree of competition, regulation and performance among the privatised industries.<ref>Parker and Martin, 'The impact of UK privatisation on labour and total factor productivity', pp. 216-7.</ref> While the output and profits of the privatised companies grew, margins increased, and employment declined, the exact relationship of these changes to privatisation is uncertain.<ref>Bishop and Kay, ''Does Privatization Work? Lessons from the UK'' (London: Centre for Business Strategy, London Business School, 1988), pp. 40-41 and 45.</ref>

Many people took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit and therefore the proportion of shares held by individuals rather than institutions did not increase. By the mid 1980s, the number of individual stockholders had tripled, and the Thatcher government had sold 1.5 million publicly owned housing units to their tenants.<ref name="eb"/>

The privatisation of public assets was combined with deregulation of finance in an attempt to fuel economic growth. Notably, in 1979 Geoffrey Howe abolished Britain's exchange controls to allow more capital to seek profits overseas and the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] of 1986 removed many restrictions on the activities of the [[London Stock Exchange]]. The Thatcher government encouraged the growth of the financial and service sectors to replace Britain's ailing manufacturing industry. [[Susan Strange]] called this new financial growth model, flourishing in Britain and America under Thatcher and Reagan, "casino capitalism" - as speculation and trading in financial claims became a more important part of the economy than industry.<ref>Andrew Gamble, ''The Spectre at the Feast'' p. 16.</ref>

==== Trade unions ====
{{See|Opposition to trade unions}}

Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the trade unions, whose leadership she accused of undermining parliamentary democracy and economic performance through paralysing strike action.<ref>Thatcher, ''Downing Street Years'', pp. 97-8.</ref> Several unions launched strikes in response to legislation introduced to curb their power, but resistance eventually collapsed.<ref name="thatcher-cw">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/thatcher/|title=Margaret Thatcher|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Only 39% of union members voted for Labour in the 1983 general election.<ref>Philip Revzin, "British Labor Unions Begin to Toe the Line, Realizing That the Times Have Changed", ''The Wall Street Journal'' (23 November 1984).</ref> According to the BBC, Thatcher "managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation."<ref name="bbcstrike">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3067563.stm|title=Enemies within: Thatcher and the unions|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=BBC|author=Wilenius, Paul|date=5 March 2004}}</ref>

The number of stoppages across the United Kingdom peaked at 4,583 in the crisis year of 1979 that brought Thatcher to power, with over 29 million working days lost. 1984, the great year of industrial confrontation with the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM), saw 1,221 stoppages and over 27 million working days lost. Stoppages then fell steadily through the rest of Thatcher's premiership, to 630 by 1990, with under 2 million working days lost, and continued to fall thereafter.<ref name=Butler/> Trade union membership also fell, from over 12 million in 1979 to 8.4 million in 1990.<ref name=Butler/>

The [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|miners' strike]] was the climax of the confrontation between the unions and the Thatcher government. In March 1984 the NUM ordered a strike, without a national ballot,<ref name="thatcher-num"/> in opposition to [[National Coal Board]] proposals to close 20 pits out of 174 state-owned mines and cut 20,000 jobs out of 187,000.<ref name=Black>Dave Black, "Still unbowed, ex-miners to mark 25 years since the start of the strike", ''The Journal'' (Newcastle, 21 February 2009), p. 19.</ref><ref name=Glass>Robert Glass, The Uncivilized Side of Britain Rears its Ugly Head, ''The Record'' (Hackensack, NJ, 16 December 1984), p. 37.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3514549.stm Watching the pits disappear], BBC News (5 March 2004).</ref> Two-thirds of the country's miners downed tools.<ref name=Glass/><ref name=Jones>Alan Jones, "A History of the Miners' Strike", ''Press Association National Newswire'' (3 March 2009).</ref>  Thatcher refused to meet the union's demands,<ref name="eb"/> and said: "We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands.

The NUM's failure to ballot and the picket line violence and intimidation cost the strike public support. A MORI poll in June 1984 found that 41% of people backed the Coal Board, and 35% the miners. By August support for the Board had risen to 46%, while support for the miners had fallen to 30%. The position remained unchanged at the end of the year. The miners' strike also split the trade union movement, with lorry drivers, dockers and power station employees crossing picket lines or handling coal.<ref name=Harper/> The strike was described as "one of the most aggressive trade union struggles since the [[1926 General Strike]]",<ref name=Miloudi/> with some commentators even suggesting it was "the nearest the country had come to civil war for 400 years".<ref name=Jones/> [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Robert Runcie]] accused Thatcher personally of fostering a "politics of confrontation", and blamed her policies for high unemployment, which he said had created "despair about the future".<ref name=Glass/>

After a year out on strike, in March 1985, the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost of the strike to the economy was estimated at least <U+00A3>1.5 billion. The strike was also blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar.<ref name=Harper/> The government proceeded to close 25 unprofitable pits in 1985; by 1992, a total of 97 pits had been closed,<ref name="pits-closed"/> with the remaining being sold off and privatised in 1994.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3531819.stm|title=UK Coal sees loss crumble to <U+00A3>1&nbsp;m|accessdate=2008-11-20|date=4 March 2004}}</ref> These actions had great effect on the industrial and political complexion of the country.<ref name="thatcher-num">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3537463.stm|title=Iron Lady versus union baron|author=Hannan, Patrick|accessdate=2008-11-20|date=6 March 2004|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The eventual closure of 150 collieries, not all of which were losing money, resulted in a loss of tens of thousands of jobs and devastated entire communities,<ref name="pits-closed">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3514549.stm|title=Watching the pits disappear|accessdate=2008-11-20|publisher=BBC|date=5 March 2004}}</ref><ref name=Lee>Adrian Lee, "King Coal", ''The Daily Express'' (9 December 2008), pp. 20-21.</ref> delivering a blow from which the coal industry, with 50 mines employing 6,000 people, has barely begun to recover, with plans for 58 new open-cast mines and up to a dozen new deep mines.<ref name=Lee/>

==== Brighton bombing ====

A handwritten note at the bottom of the photograph reads "To Margaret <U+2014> with respect and affection, Nancy." |Thatcher with US First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] at [[10 Downing Street]], 1986]]

On the early morning of 12 October 1984, the day before her 59th birthday, Thatcher narrowly escaped injury in the [[Brighton hotel bombing]] carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]].<ref name="bbc-bomb">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/12/newsid_2531000/2531583.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-29|date=12 October 1984|title=1984: Tory Cabinet in Brighton bomb blast}}</ref> Five people were killed in the attack, including the wife of Cabinet Minister [[John Wakeham]]; a prominent member of the Cabinet, [[Norman Tebbit]], was injured, and his wife Margaret was left paralysed. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to attend the Conservative Party Conference, and insisted that the conference open on time the next day.<ref name="bbc-bomb"/> She delivered her speech as planned in defiance of the bombers,<ref>Thatcher, Margaret (1993) pp. 379-383</ref> a gesture which won widespread approval across the political spectrum, and measurably enhanced her personal popularity with the public.<ref>David J. Lanoue and Barbara Headrick, "Short-Term Political Events and British Government Popularity: Direct and Indirect Effects", ''Polity'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (Spring, 1998), pp. 423, 427, 431, 432.</ref> A [[Gallup poll]] that month found her personal approval rating up from 40% to 50%, and the Conservative lead over Labour widening from 1% to 12%.<ref name="Butler"/>

==== Cold War ====
{{Main|Cold War}}

Thatcher took office in the final decade of the [[Cold War]], a period of strategic confrontation between the [[Western world#The Cold War|Western powers]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]]satellites. During her first year as prime minister she supported [[NATO]]'s decision to deploy U.S. [[Cruise missile]]s and [[Pershing missile]]s in Western Europe.<ref name="thatcher-cw"/> She permitted the United States to station more than 160 nuclear cruise missiles at [[Greenham Common]], arousing mass protests by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref name="thatcher-cw"/>

Thatcher became closely aligned with the policies of U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981<U+2013>1989), and their closeness produced transatlantic cooperation.<ref name="thatcher-cw"/> His policy of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] against the Soviets contrasted with the policy of ''[[d<U+00E9>tente]]'' which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies who still adhered to the idea of ''d<U+00E9>tente''.

Thatcher was among the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. They met in London in 1984, three months before he became General Secretary. Thatcher declared that she liked him, and told Reagan, saying, "we can do business together".<ref name="thatcher-cw"/> Following the Reagan-Gorbachev summit meetings from 1985 to 1988, as well as multiple reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, Thatcher declared in November 1988, "We're not in a Cold War now" but rather in a "new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was."<ref name="reforms1988">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC1738F93BA25752C1A96E948260|title= Gorbachev Policy Has Ended The Cold War, Thatcher Says|date=18 November 1988|work=Associated Press|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> She continued, "I expect Mr Gorbachev to do everything he can to continue his reforms. We will support it."<ref name="reforms1988"/>

Thatcher initially opposed [[German reunification]], telling Premier Gorbachev that <U+201C>this would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security.<U+201D> She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself closer with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.<ref>G<U+00F6>rtemaker, Manfred (2006), p. 198</ref> Recent records attribute Gorbachev as stating that "the West doesn<U+2019>t want German reunification but wants to use us to prevent it", possibly because of the line taken by Thatcher and other European leaders such as France's Mr Mitterrand who was even thinking of a military alliance with Russia to stop it, <U+201C>camouflaged as a joint use of armies to fight natural disasters<U+201D>.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6829735.ece Timesonline.co.uk]</ref>

Thatcher's premiership outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and those who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and ''d<U+00E9>tente'' postures.

==== Nuclear deterrent ====

In March 1982 Thatcher approved the modernisation of the [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|strategic nuclear force]] by ordering a new generation of [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident]] [[Vanguard class submarine|submarines]] to replace [[UGM-27 Polaris#British Polaris|Polaris]]<ref name=bulletin>"U.S. sale of Trident II missile system to the U.K.", ''The Department of State Bulletin'' 82 (1 May 1982), p. 59.</ref> at a cost of <U+00A3>10 billion,<ref>"Thatcher firm on Trident", ''The Times'' (11 November 1986).</ref> creating 25,000 British jobs.<ref>"Thatcher defends plans on Trident", ''The Times'' (12 March 1986).</ref> She justified the expenditure on the basis that the United Kingdom was acquiring only the minimum deterrent against Soviet aggression and rejected participation in [[START I|START negotiations]] unless the U.S. and Soviet arsenals were substantially reduced.<ref>"Thatcher to give Trident assurance", ''The Times'' (5 June 1990).</ref> She committed the government to using savings from co-operation with the United States in the nuclear field to strengthen British conventional forces.<ref name=bulletin/>

==== Hong Kong ====

On 19 December 1984, Thatcher and [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], which committed [[Hong Kong]] to the status of a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]]. Britain agreed to [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|leave]] the region in 1997.<ref>{{citebook|author=Buckley, Roger|year=1997|title=Hong Kong: The Road to 1997|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0521469791}}</ref>

==== Bombing of Libya ====

In April 1986 Thatcher, after expressing initial reservations, permitted U.S. F-111s to use RAF bases for the [[bombing of Libya]] in retaliation for the alleged [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|Libyan bombing of a Berlin discoth<U+00E8>que]],<ref name=Cannon>Lou Cannon, "Reagan Acted Upon 'Irrefutable' Evidence", ''The Washington Post'' (15 April 1986).</ref> citing the right of self-defence under [[Article 51]] of the [[UN Charter]].<ref>Peter Riddell, "Thatcher Defends US Use Of British Bases / Libya bombing raid", ''Financial Times'' (16 April 1986), p. 1.</ref>

Thatcher told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]: "The United States has more than 330,000 forces in Europe to defend our liberty. Because they are there they are subject to terrorist attack. It is inconceivable that they should be refused the right to use American aircraft and American pilots in the inherent right of self-defence to defend their own people."<ref name=DeYoung>Karen DeYoung, "Thatcher Stands Firm In Support of U.S. Europeans Criticize Attack", ''The Washington Post'' (16 April 1986).</ref>

The United Kingdom was the only nation to provide support and assistance for the U.S. action.<ref name=DeYoung/> Polls suggested that more than two out of three people disapproved of Thatcher's decision to accede to the U.S. request.<ref>Anthony Lejeune, "A friend in need", ''National Review'', 38 (23 May 1986), p. 27 (1).</ref>

Despite the [[Lebanon hostage crisis]] in in April 1986, the hijacking of [[Pan Am Flight 73]] in September 1986, and the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in December 1988, Thatcher insisted that the raid had deterred further Libyan attacks.<ref>"New evidence suggests wrong suspects were pursued for Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie", ''Glasgow Herald'' (24 April 2009).</ref>

==== Supplementary Extradition Treaty ====

Thatcher also contended that her support for the U.S. bombing of Libya imposed an obligation on the United States to ratify a new extradition treaty with the United Kingdom in order to stand up to [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] violence. "What is the point," she asked, "of the United States taking a foremost part against terrorism and then not being as strict as they can against Irish terrorism, which afflicts one of their allies?"<ref>Joseph Lelyveld, "Thatcher Faults U.S. Terror Policy", ''The New York Times'' (28 April, 1986).</ref> The U.S.-U.K. Supplementary Extradition Treaty, restricting the application of the political offence exception, signed in June 1986, and coming into force in December, was "hailed as a major improvement in the efforts of democratic nations to fight international terrorism".<ref>"An analysis of the U.S.-U.K. Supplementary Extradition Treaty", ''The International Lawyer'', Vol. 21, No. 3 (22 June 1987), p. 925.</ref>

==== Westland affair ====

Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the United States was also demonstrated in the [[Westland affair]] of 1986 when she acted with colleagues to allow the helicopter manufacturer [[Westland Aircraft|Westland]], a vital defence contractor, to refuse to link with the Italian firm [[Agusta]] in order for it to link with the management's preferred option, [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]] of the United States. Defence Secretary [[Michael Heseltine]], who had pushed the Agusta deal, resigned in protest after this, and remained an influential critic and potential leadership challenger.

==== South Africa ====

In July 1986 Thatcher expressed her belief that economic sanctions against South Africa would be immoral because they would make thousands of black workers unemployed.<ref>Hugo Young, ''Supping with the Devils'' (Atlantic, 2003), p. 6.</ref> Public dissatisfaction with her position grew steadily, reaching 65% in a MORI poll for ''[[The Times]]'' published in August 1986, following a boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] in Edinburgh by 32 nations. However just 49% of people surveyed said they would approve of an end to new investment by British companies, and a complete ban on trade, air or sporting links also failed to attract majority support. 46% said sanctions would not help bring an end to [[apartheid]], while 44% said they would.<ref name=boost>"Boost for Labour after 'Palace-Thatcher rift'; Mori poll on British Government's handling of the South Africa sanctions issue", ''The Times'' (1 August 1986).</ref>

==== Local government devolution ====

In 1986, in a controversial move, the Thatcher government abolished the [[Greater London Council]], then led by the left-wing [[Ken Livingstone]], as well as six Labour controlled [[metropolitan county|metropolitan county councils]].<ref name="glc"/> The government stated that they ordered this to decrease bureaucracy and increase efficiency, and encouraged transferring power to local councils for increased electoral accountability.<ref name="glc">{{cite news|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-30|date=31 March 1986|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530803.stm|title=1986: Greater London Council abolished}}</ref> Thatcher's opponents, however, held that the move was politically motivated, as the GLC had become a powerful centre of opposition to her government, and the county councils were in favour of higher local government taxes and public spending.

==== Relationship with the Queen ====

As Prime Minister, Thatcher met weekly with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to discuss government business.<ref>Reitan, E.A. (2003), p. 28</ref> She was just six months older than the Queen, and their relationship came under close scrutiny,<ref>Seward, Ingrid (2001), p. 154.</ref> with the media speculating that they did not get along overly well.<ref>Jones, Bill (1999), p. 78.</ref> While they displayed public images that largely contrasted,<ref>Erickson, Carolly (2005), p. 240</ref> Tim Bell, a former Thatcher advisor, recalled, "Margaret has the deepest respect for the Queen and all her family".<ref name="lr258">Lacey, Robert (2003), p. 258</ref> She was said to greet the Queen with a [[curtsey]] every time they met.<ref name="lr258"/>

In July 1986 sensational claims attributed to the Queen's advisers of a "rift" between [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Downing Street]] "over a wide range of domestic and international issues" were reported by ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.<ref name=dismayed>"Queen dismayed by 'uncaring' Thatcher", ''Sunday Times'' (20 July 1986).</ref><ref name=rift>"The Queen And Thatcher: The story they couldn't kill; Alleged rift between Premier and British Monarch", ''Sunday Times'' (27 July 1986).</ref> The immediate cause was said to be "the Queen's fear for the possible break-up of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]" because of Thatcher's rejection of comprehensive sanctions against [[South Africa]].<ref name=boost/><ref name=dismayed/> Their relationship was characterised as "pragmatic and without any personal antagonism".<ref name=dismayed/> The Palace issued an official denial, heading off speculation about a possible constitutional crisis.<ref name=rift/> However a MORI poll for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' suggested a sharp loss of support for the government following the controversy, giving Labour a six-point lead, reversing a previous Conservative six-point lead, while a separate MORI poll for ''[[The Times]]'' put Labour on 41% with a nine-point lead.<ref name=boost/>

After Thatcher's retirement a senior Palace source again dismissed as "nonsense" the "stereotyped idea" that she had not got along with the Queen or that they had fallen out over Thatcherite policies.<ref>"Queen to toast Thatcher", ''The Times'' (16 October 1995), p. 2.</ref> Thatcher herself declared that "stories of clashes between 'two powerful women' were too good not to make up ... I always found the Queen's attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct" <ref>Thatcher (1993) p. 18</ref>

==== 1987 election ====

At the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]] presided over a party deeply divided on policy agendas.<ref>Foley, Michael (2002), p. 79</ref> Margaret Thatcher, in turn, led her party to victory, winning an unprecedented third term<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/thatcher_margaret.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Margaret Thatcher (1925-)|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> with a 102 seat majority,<ref name="1987election">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpolitical.info/1987.htm|title=1987 General election results summary|accessdate=2008-10-30|publisher=UKPolitical.info}}</ref> and became the longest continuously serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] (1812 to 1827), as well as the only Prime Minister of the 20th century to serve three terms.<ref name="msn"/> She was elected riding on an economic boom against a weak Labour opposition. The Conservatives won 42.2% of the popular vote, while the Labour party won 30.8% and [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] won 22.6 %.<ref name="1987election"/>

=== Third government (1987<U+2013>1990) ===
==== Environmental issues ====

Thatcher, the former chemist, became publicly concerned with environmental issues in the late 1980s. In 1988, she made a major speech communicating the problems of [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[acid rain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Speech to the Royal Society|date=27 September 1988|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107346|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=2008-11-04}}</ref>

==== Continuation of economic changes ====

Thatcher introduced a new system for the government to raise revenue; she replaced local government taxes with a [[Community Charge|Community Charge or "Poll tax"]], in which property tax rates were made uniform, in that the same amount was charged to every individual resident, and the residential property tax was replaced with a head tax whose rate would be established by local governments.<ref name="polltax">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DD1030F930A15757C0A966958260|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-30|date=23 April 1990|author=Passell, Peter|title= Furor Over British Poll Tax Imperils Thatcher Ideology}}</ref> Thatcher's revolutionary system was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year.<ref name="msn"/>

Men in US military dress stand in the background. Beside the door is a Union Jack flag.|The Thatchers with the Reagans standing at the North Portico of the White House prior to a state dinner, 16 November 1988]]

A sceptical British public was disenchanted with Thatcher's system of local taxation<ref name="polltax"/> and it was to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership. What the Thatcher government did not anticipate was that local councils would raise their total shares from the taxes.<ref name="polltax"/> As a result, the central Government capped rates that seemed out of line, resulting in charges of partisanship and the alienation of small-government Conservatives.<ref name="polltax"/> The Prime Minister's popularity declined in 1989 as she continued to refuse to compromise on the tax.<ref name="msn"/> Unrest mounted and culminated in a number of [[Poll Tax Riots|riots]], the most serious of which occurred at [[Trafalgar Square]], London, on 31 March 1990; more than 100,000 protesters attended and more than 400 people were arrested.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm|title=Violence flares in poll tax demonstration|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

A BBC Radio poll in September 1989 indicated that almost three-quarters of the public were also against water privatisation.<ref>"News of water sale's death greatly exaggerated", ''The Times'' (2 October 1989).</ref> Despite public opposition to the poll tax and the privatisation of water, electricity, and [[British Rail]], Thatcher remained confident that, as with her other major reforms, the initial public opposition would turn into support after implementation. A [[Ipsos MORI|MORI]] poll for the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' in June 1988 found that more than 60% of voters agreed that in the long term the Thatcher government's policies would improve the state of the economy, while less than 30% disagreed; although income inequality had increased the poor were still better off than in 1979: 74% of Britons said they were satisfied with their present standard of living, while only 18% were dissatisfied.<ref>"All Thatcherites now", ''The Times'' (15 June 1988).</ref>

==== Europe ====

At Bruges, Belgium, in 1988, Thatcher made a speech in which she outlined her opposition to proposals from the [[European Union|European Community]], a forerunner to the European Union, for a federal structure and increasing centralisation of decision-making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107332|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=2008-10-31|date=20 September 1988|title=Speech to the College of Europe ("The Bruges Speech")}}</ref> Though she had supported British membership in the EC, Thatcher believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC approach to governing was at odds with her views of smaller government and deregulatory trends;<ref name="sl9"/> in 1988, she remarked, "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels".<ref name="sl9">Senden, Linda (2004), p. 9</ref> A split was emerging over European policy inside the British Government and her Conservative Party.<ref name="MT biography"/>

On 30 November 1988, when the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that Britain's detention provisions were in breach of European law, the policy split extended to parliament with the presentation of a petition calling for a written British constitution. Thatcher reacted angrily to the ECHR ruling, and to the failure of Belgium and Ireland to extradite a suspected terrorist, [[Father Patrick Ryan]], to face charges in Britain. She told the Commons: "We shall consider the judgment carefully and also the human rights of the victims and potential victims of terrorism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/30/world/british-detention-law-is-ruled-a-breach-of-rights.html|title=British Detention Law Is Ruled a Breach of Rights|date=30 November 1988|author=Whitney, Craig R|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>

At a meeting before the [[Madrid]] European Community summit in June 1989, Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Nigel Lawson]] and Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] sought to persuade Thatcher to agree to circumstances under which Great Britain would join the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a preparation for monetary union, and abolish the pound as British currency. At the meeting, they both said they would resign if their demands were not met.<ref>Thatcher, Margaret (1993), p. 712</ref> Thatcher, as well as her economic advisor [[Alan Walters]], was opposed to this notion and felt that the pound sterling should be able to float freely,<ref name="aw216">Williams, Andy (1998), p. 216</ref> and that membership would constrain the UK economy.<ref name="ecc">{{cite news|title=Thatcher stands firm against full EMS role|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106969|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=2008-10-28|author=Riddell, Peter|date=23 November 1987|work=Financial Times}}</ref> Both Lawson and Howe eventually resigned<ref name="aw216"/> and Thatcher remained firmly opposed to British membership in the European Monetary System.<ref name="ecc"/>

==== 1989 Leadership election ====

Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by virtually unknown backbench MP Sir [[Anthony Meyer]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1989|1989 leadership election]].<ref name="89election">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm|accessdate=2008-11-01|date=5 December 1989|title=1989: Thatcher beats off leadership rival|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Of the 374 Conservative MPs eligible to vote, 314 voted for Thatcher while 33 voted for Meyer; there were 27 abstentions.<ref name="89election"/> Thatcher noted, "I would like to say how very pleased I am with this result and how very pleased I am to have had the overwhelming support of my colleagues in the House and the people from the party in the country", while Meyer said he was delighted as well: "The total result I think is rather better than I had expected".<ref name="89election"/> Her supporters in the Party viewed the results as a success, and rejected suggestions that there was discontent within the Party.<ref name="89election"/>

==== Gulf War ====

{{Main|Gulf War}}

Thatcher was visiting the United States when she received word that Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]] had invaded neighbouring Kuwait.<ref name="gw-pbs">{{cite web|publisher=PBS|title=Oral History: Margaret Thatcher|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/oral/thatcher/1.html|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> She met with US President [[George H. W. Bush]], who had succeeded Ronald Reagan in 1989, during which Bush asked her, "Margaret, what is your view?" She recalled in an interview that she felt "that aggressors must be stopped, not only stopped, but they must be thrown out. An aggressor cannot gain from his aggression. He must be thrown out and really, by that time in my mind, I thought we ought to throw him out so decisively that he could never think of doing it again."<ref name="gw-pbs"/> She put pressure on Bush to deploy troops to the Middle East to drive the Iraqi army out of Kuwait.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED9113AF934A3575BC0A964958260|title=Abroad at Home; Will Bush Take Real Action?|author=Lewis, Anthony|date=7 August 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> Bush was somewhat apprehensive about the plan, so Thatcher remarked to him during a telephone conversation, "This was no time to go wobbly!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110711|title=Gulf War: Bush-Thatcher phone conversation (no time to go wobbly)|date=26 August 1990|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> Thatcher's government provided military forces to the international coalition in the [[Gulf War]] to pursue the ouster of Iraq from Kuwait.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/facts/gulfwar/|title=The Unfinished War: A Decade Since Desert Storm|publisher=CNN In-Depth Specials|year=2001|accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>

==== Resignation ====
{{See also|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990}}

Despite having the longest continuous period of office of any prime minister in the twentieth century, Thatcher had, on average during her premiership, the second-lowest approval rating of any post-war prime minister, at 40%, only beating [[Edward Heath]]; even after the Falklands War it had never risen above 55%; polls consistently showed that she was less popular than the Conservative party.<ref name="ridley">{{citation|last=Ridley|first=Matt|title=Et Tu, Heseltine?; Unpopularity Was a Grievous Fault, and Thatcher Hath Answered for It|periodical=Washington Post|date=25 November 1990|page=2}}</ref> A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted she did not care about her poll ratings, pointing instead to her unbeaten election record.<ref>"The poll tax incubus", ''The Times'' (24 November 1990).</ref>

Moreover, in relative terms, Thatcher's personal position had remained consistently strong: a Marplan poll for the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' in October 1988 showed that Thatcher was still trusted by 61% of Britons to lead the country, compared with only 17% for Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]].

A [[Ipsos MORI|Mori]] poll for the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' in September 1989 showed that Thatcher was still the public's preferred choice of Conservative leader, attracting the support of 32% of voters, her pro-European former cabinet colleague [[Michael Heseltine]] coming second on 22%.<ref name="Lipsey">{{citation|first=David|last=Lipsey|title=Poll swing followed downturn by Tories; Conservative Party leadership|periodical=The Times|date=21 November 1990}}</ref> However, by March 1990, in the face of rising inflation and the threat of a [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and inevitable mass unemployment, Thatcher's support had halved to 15%, with Heseltine's doubling to 40%.<ref name="Lipsey"/> Opposition to the poll tax<ref name="POLL">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm|title=1990: Violence flares in poll tax demonstration|publisher=BBC News|date=1990-03-31}}</ref> and the divisions opening in the parliamentary party over [[European integration]]<ref name="msn"/> left Thatcher increasingly vulnerable to a challenge.<ref name="baker">{{citation|first=Sue|last=Baker|title=Thatcher Retires to Country Home, Political Future in Doubt|publisher=Reuters News|date=3 November 1990}}</ref>

A few days later Heseltine challenged her for the leadership of the party. A [[Gallup poll]] for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' showed that 28% of voters would be more inclined to vote Conservative if Heseltine were leader, and only 7% would be less inclined.

== Later years ==

Mrs Thatcher retained her parliamentary seat in the House of Commons as MP for Finchley for two years despite returning to the backbenches after leaving the premiership. She supported [[John Major]] as her successor and he duly won the leadership contest, although in the years to come her approval of Major would fall away.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/463873.stm|title=UK Politics: Major attacks 'warrior' Thatcher|accessdate=2008-11-01|date=3 October 1999}}</ref> She occasionally spoke in the House of Commons after she was Prime Minister, commenting and campaigning on issues regarding her beliefs and concerns.<ref name="msn"/> In 1991, she was given a five minute, unprecedented standing ovation at the party's annual conference.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Financial Times|accessdate=2008-11-01|url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto092220070244364696&page=2|title=Blair to avoid annual party conference|author=O'Doherty, John|date=22 September 2007}}</ref> She retired from the House at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]], at the age of 66 years; she said that leaving the Commons would allow her more freedom to speak her mind.<ref name="lords">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/30/newsid_2523000/2523395.stm|publisher=BBC|title=1992: Thatcher takes her place in Lords|date=30 June 1992|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref>

=== After Parliament ===

Margaret Thatcher became a peer in [[House of Lords]] in 1992 by the bestowal of a [[life peerage]] as ''Baroness Thatcher'', of [[Kesteven]] in the County of Lincolnshire.<ref name="lords"/><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52943|supp=yes|startpage=1|date=5 June 1992|accessdate=2008-02-28}} See also: {{London Gazette|issue=52978|startpage=11045|date=1 July 1992|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Thatcher had already been honoured by the Queen in 1990, shortly after her resignation as Prime Minister, when awarded the [[Order of Merit]], one of the UK's highest distinctions and in the personal conferment of the sovereign.<ref name="OMBarontecy">{{London Gazette|issue=52360|startpage=19066|date=11 December 1990|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> At the same time it was announced that her husband, Denis, would be given a [[baronet]]cy, which was confirmed in 1991<ref name="OMBarontecy" /><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52443|startpage=1993|date=7 February 1991|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> (ensuring that their son, [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]], would inherit a title).

After leaving the House of Commons, Thatcher remained active in politics. She wrote two volumes of memoirs: ''The Downing Street Years'', published in 1993 and ''The Path to Power'' published in 1995. A third book followed these, ''Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World'', detailing her thoughts on [[international relations]] since her resignation in 1990. 

In August 1992 Thatcher called for [[NATO]] to stop the Serbian assault on [[Gora<U+017E>de]] and [[Sarajevo]] in order to end [[ethnic cleansing]] and to preserve the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] state. She described the situation in Bosnia as "reminiscent of the worst excesses of the [[Nazi]]s," warning that there could be a "holocaust" in Bosnia and described the conflict as a "killing field the like of which I thought we would never see in Europe again."<ref>{{cite news|date=6 August 1992|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DE1731F935A3575BC0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|title=Stop the Excuses.

From 1993 to 2000, Lady Thatcher served as Chancellor of the [[College of William and Mary]] in Virginia, which, established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1693, is the sole royal foundation in the contiguous United States. She was also Chancellor of the [[University of Buckingham]], the UK's only private university.

After [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|election as Labour Party leader]] in 1994, Thatcher gave an interview in May 1995 in which she praised Blair as "probably the most formidable Labour leader since [[Hugh Gaitskell]].

I think he genuinely has moved."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifthinternational.org/index.php?id=50,201,0,0,1,0|title=What<U+2019>s new about <U+201C>New Labour<U+201D>?|publisher=League for the Fifth International|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>

Lady Thatcher visited former Chilean president [[Augusto Pinochet]], once a key British ally during the 1982 Falklands War, while he was under house arrest in Surrey in 1998.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Lady Thatcher supported the Conservative general election campaign but this time did not endorse Iain Duncan Smith in public as she had done previously for John Major and William Hague. In the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001|Conservative leadership election]] shortly after, she supported [[Iain Duncan Smith]] because she believed he would "make infinitely the better leader" than Kenneth Clarke.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Letter supporting Iain Duncan Smith for the Conservative leadership published in the ''Daily Telegraph''|date=2001-08-21|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108390| publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>

=== Activities since 2003 ===

Thatcher was widowed upon the death of Sir Denis Thatcher on 26 June 2003.

Now in her declining years, she began complaining about her "lost" family, (Mark in South Africa, Carol in Switzerland), but her daughter was less than sympathetic; "A mother cannot reasonably expect her grown-up children to boomerang back, gushing cosiness and make up for lost time. Absentee Mum, then Gran in overdrive is not an equation that balances."<ref> Observer Profile of Carol Thatcher 27 November 2005</ref>

On 13 November 2009, rumours of Thatcher's death were erroneously circulated within the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Government of Canada|Government]] whilst they attended a black-tie dinner, after [[Minister of Transport (Canada)|transport minister]] [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]] sent a [[Text messaging|text message]] announcing the death of his pet [[Tabby cat|tabby]] called [[namesake|Thatcher]]. However, the news was reported to [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] as the death of Baroness Thatcher, and almost caused a diplomatic incident between Canada and the United Kingdom, but the Canadian Government rang Downing Street and Buckingham Palace to seek verification.<ref>Jones, Ian [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8358544.stm 'Thatcher dead' text sparks fears], ''[[BBC News]]'', accessed 13/11/2009</ref>

== Legacy ==
{{Thatcherism}}
Thatcher remains identified with her remarks to the reporter Douglas Keay, for ''[[Woman's Own]]'' magazine, 23 September 1987:

{{quote|I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!" or "I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!" "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations...<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview for Woman's Own ("no such thing as society") with journalist Douglas Keay|date=23 September 1987|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106689|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref>}}
As the individualistic credo expressed above took hold of Thatcher's Britain, egalitarian concerns  dwindled. " Authorities on poverty rates and income distributions differ as to precisely when the optimum moment of equality in Britain came, but some statistics leap out. The [[Gini coefficient]], a common measure of income inequality, reached its lowest level for British households in 1977. The proportion of individual Britons below the poverty line did the same in 1978. Social mobility, the likelihood of someone becoming part of a different class from their parents, peaked in the [[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] era. The egalitarian Britain of the Callaghan years and its  social trends were  relentlessly reversed  in the Thatcher years and beyond, so that Britain in the 1970s was probably more equal than it had ever been before, and certainly more than it has ever been since" <ref> ''When the Lights Went Out'' p.409-410  Andy Beckett </ref> Thatcher.
To her supporters Margaret Thatcher remains a figure who revitalised Britain's economy, impacted the trade unions, and re-established the nation as a world power.<ref name="legacy-bbc">{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Evaluating Thatcher's legacy|date=4 May 2004|accessdate=2008-11-01|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3681973.stm}}</ref> Yet Thatcher was also a controversial figure, her premiership  marked by high unemployment and social unrest,<ref name="legacy-bbc"/> and many critics fault her economic policies for the unemployment level.<ref>Richard, Howard (2004), p. 63</ref> Speaking in [[Scotland]] in April 2009, before the 30th anniversary of her election as prime minister, Thatcher declared: "I regret nothing," and insisted she "was right to introduce the [[Community Charge|poll tax]] and to close loss-making industries to end the country's 'dependency culture'."<ref>"Thatcher: I did right by Scots; Thatcher: I regret nothing.(News)", ''Sunday Times'' (26 April 2009), p. 1.</ref> Critics have regretted her influence in the abandonment of full employment, poverty reduction and a consensual civility as bedrock policy objectives. The tone of many recent biographers has been 'that of a policeman examining a nasty crime scene' and [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] writing in ''[[The New Statesman]]'' in February 2009 wondered if the ' hubristic collapse of the free-market model of capitalism that she promoted [had] dealt her another blow. Who was it who first removed the seat belts and airbags from the safe-but-boring Volvo that the West built after 1945? 'Her freer, more promiscuous version of capitalism' in [[Hugo Young]]'s phrase is reaping a darker harvest." <ref> Michael White ''The Making of Maggie'' The New Statesman 26 February 2009</ref> 

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]], in adapting its [[social democratic]] agenda, incorporated much of the economic, social and political tenets of Thatcherism.<ref name="legacy-guardian">{{cite news|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-11-01|date=3 May 1999|title=Thatcher's legacy|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/may/03/thatcher.uk}}</ref> Thatcher's programme of [[privatization|privatising]] [[nationalisation|state-owned enterprises]] has not been reversed.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-11-01|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/ufd_privatizethatcher.html|title=Up for Debate: Privatization and the Thatcher Legacy}}</ref> Indeed, successive Conservative and Labour governments have further curtailed direct state management of the economy and have further dismantled public ownership.<ref name="legacy-guardian"/> Yet Thatcher's growth model, as it promoted privatisation of public assets and deregulation of the private sector, particularly the financial sector, its encouragement of the financial sector to 'create new ways of spreading risk and expanding credit' has, since 2008, looked less definitive. The financial revolution in London in the 1980s meant that among the large economies none rivalled Britain for the relative size of its financial sector. Whether the events of 2008-2009, "the collapse of a particular growth model and ideology, the discrediting of many of the prescriptions of [[neo-liberalism]], ''and the dramatic return of the state'', in the form of bank bailouts and nationalizations - constitute a permanent and major political and ideological shift, or whether the changes will only prove to be temporary" - is still to be seen.<ref> [[Andrew Gamble]] ''The Spectre at the Feast'' p.9</ref> In his 2009 TV series 'Off Kilter', looking at Scotland,  the cultural commentator [[Jonathan Meades]] spoke of Thatchers legacy in Fife: "Fife's mining towns and villages were victims, collateral as they say, of that bloody spat of 25 years ago; - mining ''might'', just ''might'', have been economically exhausted, but it was socially cohesive; it's undeniable that jobs do foment pride, they inculcate an idea of self worth. Finchley was quite incapable of empathy.  There is much to be said in favour of inefficient industry, not least that that the human cost of efficiency and adherence  to the bottom line does not have to be paid, - nor for that matter does unemployment benefit have to be paid to the tens of thousands rationalised into involuntary idleness. Further, the Finchley faith, which became the enthusiastically adopted cross-party consensus of the past 25 years, the ''faith'' that manufacturing industry was an irrelevance, and that an entire economy, a souffl<U+00E9> economy, might be founded on the no-holds-barred selflessness of deregulated debt rights, peddling expensive money, proved to be just that, a ''faith'', an expression of unfounded wishfulness." <ref> Jonathan Meades, ''Off Kilter'' BBC Four September 2009</ref>

After her resignation in 1990, a [[MORI]] poll found that 52% of Britons agreed that "On balance she had been good for the country", while 48% disagreed.<ref>Kavanagh, Dennis (1997), p. 134</ref> In April 2008, the ''Daily Telegraph'' commissioned a [[YouGov]] poll asking whom Britons regarded as the greatest post-World War II prime minister; Thatcher came in first, receiving 34% of the vote, while Winston Churchill ranked second with 15%.<ref>[http://www.yougov.co.uk/extranets/ygarchives/content/pdf/DT080401thatcher.pdf Prime Minister (Daily Telegraph)], YouGov/Daily Telegraph Survey Results, 7 April 2008.</ref><ref>Rosalind Ryan, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/apr/07/post3 Voters prefer Thatcher and Blair to Brown, poll finds], guardian.co.uk, Monday 7 April 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/04/the_living_legacy_of_maggie_th.html|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=2008-11-01|title=The Living Legacy of Maggie Thatcher: How the Politics of Conviction Saved Britain|author=Fields, Suzanne|publisher=RealClearPolitics.com}}</ref>

Neo-liberals hope by this means to seize back the ground they have lost. But, like Keynesianism in the 1970s, neo-liberalism has suffered some hammer blows." <ref name=gamble>{{cite book | last = Gamble | first = Andrew | authorlink = Andrew Gamble | coauthors =  | title = The Spectre at the Feast: Capitalist Crisis and the Politics of Recession | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | date = 2009 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 69 | url =  | isbn = 9780230230743 }}</ref> Gamble further adds, "The 'efficient markets thesis', the belief that markets if left alone would always price assets correctly, is in ruins." <ref name=gamble/>

Thatcher was quoted by a supporter as having said in April 2009 that she was "appalled" by Brown's handling of the economy, and it was claimed that she said she saw it as "a repeat" of the crisis of the 1970s that had brought her radical reforming government to power.<ref>Jason Allardyce, "Thatcher 'appalled' by Brown's spending spree", ''Sunday Times'' (12 April 2009), p. 8.</ref>  Pointing to the "huge convergence around liberal labour markets, liberal migration policies and high levels of public spending," one leading analyst summed up the new policy paradigm as: "Thatcher plus [[Keynesian economics|Keynes]]".<ref name="Underhill"/>
