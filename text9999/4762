In 2006, Ramsay became the first British golfer in almost a century to win the [[United States Amateur Championship (men's golf)|United States Amateur Championship]].<ref name=usam>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/5291676.stm |title=Ramsay storms to US Amateur title |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=27 August 2006 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref> He also won several other amateur titles and played in the 2005 [[Walker Cup]].

Ramsay turned professional in 2007, and played two seasons on the second tier [[Challenge Tour]], winning twice in 2008. He finished 8th on the end of season rankings that year to graduate to the elite [[PGA European Tour|European Tour]] for 2009.

==Personal life==
Ramsay was born in [[Aberdeen]]. He is an honorary member of Royal Aberdeen Golf Club and was a student at the [[Stirling University]] in Scotland, where he graduated in 2007.

==Amateur career==
Ramsay won the Scottish Amateur Open Stroke Play Championship in 2004, and the Irish Amateur Open Stroke Play Championship in 2005. He went on to represent Great Britain & Ireland in the Walker Cup later that year. 

In [[2006 in golf|2006]], Ramsay won the U.S. Amateur Championship, defeating American [[John Kelly (golfer)|John Kelly]] 4 & 2 in the 36-hole final.
