The '''1994 national convention''' of the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party of Norway]] was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesj<U+00F8> Turisthotell in [[Bolkesj<U+00F8>]], [[Telemark]]. It was originally set up to be a normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions could be at stake. The party leader seat, held by [[Carl I. Hagen]] since 1978, was up for re-election. The deputy leaders [[Ellen Wibe]] and [[Hans J. R<U+00F8>sjorde]] was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a motion of no confidence against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.

The traditionalist (also called populist) faction was represented by party leader Carl I. Hagen, [[Jan Simonsen]], [[Fridtjof Frank Gundersen]], [[Vidar Kleppe]], [[<U+00D8>ystein Hedstr<U+00F8>m]], [[Lodve Solholm]] and [[Eli Hagen]]. The libertarians of the party were first and foremost the deputy leader Ellen Wibe and four members of [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] (by some called the "band of four"), [[Ellen Christine Christiansen]], [[Oscar D. Hillgaar]], [[Roy N. Wetterstad]] and [[Stephen Br<U+00E5>then]]. Buskerud county leader [[Geir Thoresen]], Akershus county leader [[Per Aage Pleym Christensen]] and [[Youth of the Progress Party (Norway)|Youth of the Progress Party]] leader [[Lars Erik Gr<U+00F8>nntun]] were other prominent libertarians. Both during the preceding months and on the opening day, resolutions were passed which ensured full dominance for Carl I. Hagen and the policies of his faction. Wibe resigned as deputy leader, and Carl I. Hagen's men (there were no women left in the leadership) also dominated the new central committee. The personal issues totally overshadowed the regular political debate, and as early as on 17 April the convention was famously dubbed as the "national convention at Dolkesj<U+00F8>"<U+2014>derived from ''dolk'', the Norwegian word for [[dagger]].

In April and May, the Progress Party lost several members, including former members of Parliament and four current members of Parliament. In July the Youth of the Progress Party dissolved itself in protest of the events; however, a new, loyal organization immediately surfaced. Some of the withdrawn members joined the [[Conservative Party of Norway]], others joined an entirely new organization (originally with the narrow intention to support the four parliamentarians), the quasi-political party [[Free Democrats (Norway)|Free Democrats]].

==Run-up==
===Before 1994===
The 1993 national convention was harmonic. The newspaper ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' remarked that both "the libertarians and the populists cheered" after Carl I. Hagen's speeches. [[Jan Simonsen]] stepped down as deputy leader, and [[Ellen Wibe]] succeeded him, being one of the very few women in the Progress Party's leadership.<ref>{{cite news|title=Her er Hagens damer|first=Finn Oluf|last=Nyquist|coauthors=B<U+00F8>, Erling; Mikalsen, Helge; Knudsen, Knut Erik|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=25 April 1993|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

There were some tensions, however. [[Finn Thoresen]] left the party in November 1992, and later formed [[New Future Coalition Party]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Nytt kristent parti tegn p<U+00E5> velger-misn<U+00F8>ye|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=2 December 1992|language=Norwegian}}</ref> More importantly, because of disagreements in 1992 and 1993, pertaining to [[libertarianism]] in general and especially the [[Norwegian European Union membership referendum, 1994|European Union question]], several libertarians that had entered the Progress Party in the 1980s ceased their activity in the party. MPs [[Tor Mikkel Wara]] and [[Petter Bj<U+00F8>rheim]] announced their intentions to leave politics after the end of their terms,<ref name=faane>{{cite news|title=Tilbake til r<U+00F8>ttene|first=Erling|last=B<U+00F8>|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=19 January 1993|language=Norwegian}}</ref> as did [[P<U+00E5>l Atle Skjervengen]].<ref name=skjervengen>{{cite news|title=Det endelige farvel|first=Anders|last=Bjartnes|coauthors=Skogseth, Arne; S<U+00F8>nstelie, Rolf; Nondal, Tor; Lynau, Jan Petter|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=19 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> [[Jan Erik F<U+00E5>ne]] tried to win renomination, but the nomination meeting in [[Akershus]] put traditionalist [[Fridtjof Frank Gundersen]] on top of the ballot. F<U+00E5>ne was offered the second spot, but pulled out.<ref name=faane/> Eight months later it turned out that holding the second spot on the ballot did indeed give a Parliament seat.

The issue of libertarianism became more pressing in the campaign for the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1993]], when Carl I. Hagen said to ''Verdens Gang'' that he did not support [[tax cut|cutting]] the [[income tax]]. This was not in line with official party policy, and Hagen did not confer with the party, stating that "I had to take an independent initiative". Ellen Wibe openly criticized the statement, so did former MP and tax spokesperson [[Steinar Maribo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Partifeller sliper kniven|first=St<U+00E5>l|last=Talsnes|coauthors=Kollstad, Per|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=8 September 1993|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The tax statement was later seen as the most important factor contributing to the growing Hagen<U+2014>liberalist schism.<ref name=vendte>{{cite news|title=Vendte Carl I. ryggen|first=Tor M.|last=Mondal|coauthors=Fougner, Christian|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In the election the Progress Party won ten seats,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=polsys&lan=&MenuItem=N1_1&ChildItem=&State=collapse&UttakNr=110&Periodetekst=138&parti=FrP|title=Representanter og suppleanter i perioden 1993-97 (FrP)|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> down from 22 in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1989|1989 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=storting&lan=&MenuItem=N1_1&ChildItem=&State=collapse&UttakNr=110&Periodetekst=134&parti=FrP|title=Representanter og suppleanter i perioden 1989-93 (FrP)|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref>

<sup>1</sup> = Left the Progress Party as a result of the convention.

===1994===
The year 1994 started with annual conventions in each county, scheduled between 15 January and 6 April. These conventions elected delegates to the national convention. Tension had mounted between party leader Carl I. Hagen and other factions in the party. Parts of the central committee were skeptical to Hagen's position and policies. In addition, the [[youth wing]], [[Youth of the Progress Party (Norway)|Youth of the Progress Party]], had experienced disagreements with the Hagen-led Progress Party. The leader of the Youth of the Progress Party, [[Lars Erik Gr<U+00F8>nntun]], had been on the verge of stepping down, but was persuaded around the end of 1993 to run for re-election. Before the county conventions, Gr<U+00F8>nntun stated a desire for an extraordinary meeting between the party and its youth wing, where he wanted to "contribute to gathering the party and avoid any signs of a split".<ref>{{cite news|title=Spennende fylkes<U+00E5>rsm<U+00F8>ter i FrP|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=5 January 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

On 3 January, Hagen presented a ten-point plan of action. It was to be sent to each county chapter, and supported or rejected at the county conventions. On 7 January, Ellen Wibe presented a competing plan of action together with Oscar Hillgaar, Ellen Christine Christiansen and Geir Thoresen. Wibe's plan criticized the party's organizational culture, communication and institutions. In an interview, Wibe said that the party was too similar to a "[[charismatic movement]]", and that she wanted more power to the central board ({{lang-no|sentralstyre}}).<ref>{{cite news|title=FrP m<U+00E5> velge Hagen eller Wibe|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=7 January 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> <U+00D8>ystein Hedstr<U+00F8>m announced a possible [[motion of no confidence]] regarding Ellen Wibe's position as deputy party leader, even though she was not really up for election until 1995. Wibe replied that her intention was to gather the party.<ref name=landsmoeter>{{cite news|title=Avgj<U+00F8>rende helg for Fr.p.|first=Heidi|last=Borud|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=5 February 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> A few months before the national convention, Wibe's husband Odd Magnar Brub<U+00E6>k was fired from his job as secretary of the Progress Party's parliamentary group.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wibe: Kampen gikk p<U+00E5> helsen l<U+00F8>s|first=|last=|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===County conventions and national board meeting===
In the weekend from 4 to 6 February, county conventions were held in eleven counties, including Hagen's native [[Oslo]], and [[Buskerud]], [[Finnmark]], [[Telemark]], [[Vest-Agder]], [[Hordaland]], [[Nordland]], [[<U+00D8>stfold]], [[Troms]], [[Nord-Tr<U+00F8>ndelag]] and [[M<U+00F8>re og Romsdal]]. Hagen belonged to the Oslo chapter, but the leader of the chapter, [[Peter N. Myhre]], stated beforehand that Hagen's proposal would probably be rejected. It was speculated that rejections could come from the Buskerud and Finnmark's conventions as well.<ref name=landsmoeter/> On 7 February, Hagen confirmed his leadership candidacy for the electoral committee.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hagen tar gjenvalg som partileder|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=7 February 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

On 19 February, the party held a national board ({{lang-no|landsstyre}}) meeting at Bolkesj<U+00F8>. Here, Hagen proposed to close the debate on "the party profile and choice of values", a motion which gained support from 24 of the 11 board members. Ellen Wibe was among the minority, but conceded for the time being. That way, the question was put down before reaching the national convention.<ref name=landsstyremoete/>

By then, fifteen county conventions had signalized support for Hagen.<ref name=landsstyremoete>{{cite news|title=FrP avslutter striden om partiprofilen|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=19 February 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> After the last convention, it was clear that one-third of the delegates had expressed support of Wibe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Avgj<U+00F8>rende helg for Ellen Wibe|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=14 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Before the national convention, Hagen stated in an interview that one "never can know what will happen during a Progress Party national convention".<ref name=eu1>{{cite news|title="Mye god markedsliberalisme i EU"|first=Terje|last=Valestrand|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=14 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Further preparations===
The next two months was a quiet period, and <U+00D8>ystein Hedstr<U+00F8>m stated that Wibe had taken a more responsible role, and thus there was no need for a motion of no confidence.<ref name=13april>{{cite news|title=Wibe tatt til n<U+00E5>de i Fr.p.|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=13 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> News commentator Aslak Bonde remarked that the compromise reached by the factions was "unclear" and that antagonism could surface at the national convention.<ref>{{cite news|title=Uken som kommer|first=Aslak|last=Bonde|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=10 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Wibe stated that her faction still intended to submit a resolution, a "constructive" proposal regarding tactical and organizational issues. Two days before the national convention, this resolution text had not been submitted to the county delegates.<ref name=13april/> On the next day, the resolution text was commented in newspapers. ''[[Aftenposten]]'' remarked that Wibe's proposal was a "thorough criticism of Carl I. Hagen", among others in that it called for "a renewal of the party".<ref>{{cite news|title=Tvetydighet som dyd|author=editorial|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=14 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> It was signed by Oscar D. Hillgaar, Ellen Chr. Christiansen, Stephen Br<U+00E5>then and Roy Wetterstad together with Wibe. ''Verdens Gang'' reported that Wibe would resign if not given a clear confidence as deputy leader.<ref>{{cite news|title=Truer med <U+00E5> g<U+00E5> av|first=Rolf|last=S<U+00F8>nstelie|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=14 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Wibe refuted this in ''Aftenposten'' on the next day; the newspaper believed that no party split would occur.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trolig ingen partisplittelse|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=15 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Another question of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian membership in the [[European Union]]. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were not in favor of this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed.<ref name=eu1/> Central board member Terje S<U+00E6>b<U+00F8> submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.<ref>{{cite news|title=Haltende EU-ja|first=Tellef|last=<U+00D8>grim|work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]]|date=14 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==Meeting==
Carl I. Hagen held the opening speech of the convention. The speech was interrupted by extensive applause nineteen times.<ref name=oppvask>{{cite news|title=Fritt fram for Hagen etter oppvask i b<U+00F8>ttekott|first=Terje|last=Valestrand|coauthors=Aarre, Einar|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In it, he stated:<ref>{{cite news|title=Hagen gjentar "gamle" FrP-standpunkter|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=15 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>
{{cquote|In case one wants a label, that would, in accordance with our ideological basis, be a Christian-Libertarian party. The [[New Testament]] is packed with libertarian ideas of freedom and emphasizes voluntarity and personal responsibility. For those who criticize our values, I warmly recommend some Bible reading.}}

===Resolutions and withdrawals===
One of the first questions which was voted over, was the EU issue. Hagen formally submitted a proposal that the factual aspects of this issue should not be debated, and this was passed with 113 against 44 votes.<ref>{{cite news|title=FrP fortsetter uten EU-standpunkt|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=15 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The EU vote directly caused Ellen Wibe to step down as deputy party leader, stating that she did "not fully understand the new profile of the party". If not stepping down, she would compromise "values and principles" that were essential in order to "live with [her]self as a human being".<ref>{{cite news|title=Wibe: Det som har skjedd kan ikke rettes opp|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=15 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The announcement followed a private meeting between Wibe, Hagen, R<U+00F8>sjorde and Gr<U+00F8>nntun. Allegedly, Tor Mikkel Wara had advised her to resign.<ref name=vendte/> Ellen Christine Christiansen stepped down from her position in the central board, leaving Gr<U+00F8>nntun as the only clear libertarian.<ref name=oppvask/> Gr<U+00F8>nntun stated that young party members would not tolerate to be "stepped on and hectored with {{sic}}" forever.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wibe: Kampen gikk p<U+00E5> helsen l<U+00F8>s|first=|last=|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> More generally, the losing faction signalized a desire to continue promoting a liberal political profile, but in a less dramatic way.<ref name=vals>{{cite news|title=Liberalistene i FrP valses ned|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=15 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Immediately after Wibe's announcement, [[Jan Simonsen]] entered the chair and spoke strongly in favor of Hagen.<ref name=vals/> [[Fridtjof Frank Gundersen]] applauded the end of "women's bickering" in the party leadership.<ref name=harbo>{{cite news|title=Wibe trakk seg som nestformann|first=Hilde|last=Harbo|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Hagen's main resolution proposal, titled ''En fremtid med rot i fortiden'', was passed with 94 against 50 votes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Partieieren uten politikk|first=Bente Egjar|last=Engesland|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He also received support for prioritizing [[anti-immigration]] higher in the following period.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hagen maner til kamp mot muslimene|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In his closing speech, Hagen stated that "disloyal" behavior would be considered as "active withdrawal" from the party.<ref>{{cite news|title=Forsoningsdialog uten h<U+00E5>p|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=17 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> From the rostrum, the "band of four" was even asked to withdraw by several delegates, including Bj<U+00F8>rn Andreassen, Gustav Hareide and Fr<U+00F8>ydis Lange. Andreassen exclaimed that "we don't want you", while Lange asked the band of four to form a new party called the Anarchist Party.<ref name=hevn>{{cite news|title=Hagens hevn|first=Terje|last=Valestrand|coauthors=Aarre, Einar|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

The central board held an extraordinary meeting on 17 April, during a pre-scheduled break in the convention.<ref>{{cite news|title=Krisem<U+00F8>te i FrP|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=17 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The central board of the Youth of the Progress Party also met, and agreed to support the "band of four". Their decision was not final until an extraordinary national board meeting could be held. It was speculated that members of the youth wing could leave the Progress Party en masse.<ref name=vg18apr>{{cite news|title=Utst<U+00F8>tt|first=Rolf|last=S<U+00F8>nstelie|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===New deputy leader===
After Wibe's resignation, Jan Simonsen was mentioned as an, albeit unlikely, candidate to succeed Wibe. [[Vidar Kleppe]] was also mentioned, while traditionalist [[John Alvheim]] was regarded by newspapers as a more likely candidate.<ref name=vals/><ref name=harbo/> On Saturday 16 April, it became clear that the vote stood between the Peter N. Myhre and [[Lodve Solholm]]. Myhre was the candidate put forward by the electoral committee, and had support among the libertarians, who did not field their own candidate.<ref>{{cite news|title=FrP-nestformann: Kampvotering Myhre-Solholm|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 17 April, Solholm won the vote with 90 against 58; 8 ballots were [[blank vote|blank]]. Carl I. Hagen was re-elected with 113 against 0 votes, and with 44 blank ballots.<ref>{{cite news|title=Solholm ny nestformann i FrP|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=17 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> One libertarian, former MP [[Terje Nyberget]], who described the convention as a "[[genocide]]", was elected to the national board.<ref>{{cite news|title=FrP|first=Trond|last=Wold|work=[[Nordlys]]|date=19 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Political scientist [[Frank Aarebrot]] summed up the convention turmoil in the following way:<ref>{{cite news|title=Underlig utrenskning av alle med ideologi|first=Per Jon|last=Odeen|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>
{{cquote|This is one of the most peculiar things to happen in Norwegian political history.}}

===Band of four defect===
Already on the second day of the convention it was speculated{{by whom|date=December 2010}} that the "band of four", four libertarian-leaning members of Parliament, considered leaving the party. The four were Oscar D. Hillgaar, Roy Wetterstad, Ellen Christine Christiansen and Stephen Br<U+00E5>then. The alternative to leaving the party was to mark themselves as dissenting party members.<ref>{{cite news|title=Avskalling truer FrPs stortingsgruppe|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=16 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> On the third day, news surfaced that the four had talked together.<ref name=17apr>{{cite news|title=Dagen derp<U+00E5> for Ellen Wibe|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=17 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In the news program ''[[Dagsrevyen]]'' on 17 April, the band of four stated a desire to follow the 1993 party platform and not later resolutions.<ref name=hevn/> They were met by a demand from Carl I. Hagen that they continue on the "terms laid down by the national convention or find something else to do".<ref>{{cite news|title=Parti i oppl<U+00F8>sning|author=editorial|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He later added that if the band of four left the parliamentary group, they should "scram".<ref>{{cite news|title=- Vis lojalitet - eller pell dere vekk!|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> To sum up, he said that the libertarians, which were known to be a minority, had gained too much influence, and was set back by the national convention.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hillgaar dikter, sier Hagen|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=22 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> <U+00D8>ystein Hedstr<U+00F8>m demanded that the four leave the party.<ref name=revner-vg>{{cite news|title=N<U+00E5> revner Hagens parti|first=Tor M.|last=Nondal|coauthors=S<U+00F8>nstelie, Rolf; B<U+00F8>, Erling; Fougner, Christian|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=17 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Because of the fierce personal antagonism at the convention, it was dubbed as the "national convention at Dolkesj<U+00F8>"<U+2014>derived from ''dolk'', the Norwegian word for [[dagger]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Hagen tok kontrollen <U+2013> Fremskrittspartiet tapte|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=17 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Wibe encouraged people to stay in the Progress Party, although her active participation was over.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wibe: Bli i Fremskrittspartiet|first=Olav|last=Garvik|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=22 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Wetterstad stated in an interview that withdrawing his party membership was out of question, whereas Hillgaar was described as the least conciliatory.<ref name=vg18apr/> Hillgaar publicly lamented the "[[Moscow processes]]" of the 1994 national convention, and also the views on women and the "extreme xenophobia" which he felt was conveyed by the party program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mot splittelse i FrP?|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=17 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The Progress Party county leader in Akershus, [[Per Aage Pleym Christensen]], also reconsidered his position,<ref name=17apr/> leaving on 4 May.<ref>{{cite news|title=Regional sprekk ogs<U+00E5>|author=editorial|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=4 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Oscar Hillgaar left the party on 22 April. The other three libertarian parliamentarians postponed their decision, attending meetings with county leaders on 17 and 22 April.<ref>{{cite news|title=Frp-utbryteren blir ensom p<U+00E5> Stortinget|first=Terje|last=Valestrand|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=22 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> A leading figure in these talks was [[Henning Holstad]] from Oslo.<ref name=fraksj>{{cite news|title=FrP-"fraksjonen" vil inn i folden|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=23 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Hagen replied that such talks had no grounds in the Progress Party by-laws.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nedkj<U+00F8>rt|first=Tor M.|last=Nondal|coauthors=S<U+00F8>nstelie, Rolf; B<U+00F8>, Erling; Fougner, Christian|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The meeting on 22 April went well for the three parliamentarians,<ref name=fraksj/> but on 30 April the central committee met, and <U+00D8>ystein Hedstr<U+00F8>m put forward a proposal for a "loyalty declaration" to Hagen and the policies agreed to on the national convention.<ref>{{cite news|title='Grensen er n<U+00E5>dd'|first=Rolf|last=S<U+00F8>nstelie|coauthors=Audestad, Paal|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=30 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The proposal of a written declaration was not passed, but the central committee decided to demand loyalty.

The three parliamentarians finally left the party on 3 May. It was speculated that the deputy representatives for Br<U+00E5>then and Wetterstad, Per Aage Pleym Christensen in Akershus and Geir Thoresen in Buskerud, would follow. Wetterstad drew the lines to Hagen's own withdrawal from the [[Anders Lange Party]] to form the short-lived [[Reform Party (Norway, 1974)|Reform Party]].<ref name=halveres>{{cite news|title=FrPs stortingsgruppe halveres|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=3 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Coincidentally, Hagen celebrated his 50th birthday on 6 May.<ref>{{cite news|title=T<U+00F8>ff 50-<U+00E5>rsgave til Carl I.

===Youth wing defects===
With four of ten having resigned from the parliamentary group, the Youth of the Progress Party was the next institution to experience turmoil. In May ''Verdens Gang'' announced that a forthcoming extraordinary national convention, spearheaded by Lars Erik Gr<U+00F8>nntun, would cut its ties with the Progress Party.<ref name=tusenvis>{{cite news|title=P<U+00E5> vei ut med tusenvis av medlemmer|first=Tor M.|last=Nondal|coauthors=Sandblad, Mattis|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=9 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The county leader in Oslo, Kim M. H<U+00F8>istad, formally proposed such a move. A straight-forward dissolution of the Youth of the Progress Party would, however, most likely be followed by an immediate resurrection of the youth wing by Hagen-loyal members.<ref name=leggned>{{cite news|title=Oslo FpU: Legg ned Fremskrittspartiets Ungdom|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=22 June 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> H<U+00F8>istad's proposal was quickly co-signed by the Akershus branch, through its leader Trine Beate Samuelsen, and the Buskerud branch through its leader Per Magne Pedersen. The county chapters in Telemark, Aust-Agder, Vest-Agder, Oppland and Rogaland also voiced support.<ref name=dolkest>{{cite news|title=Dolkest<U+00F8>t|first=Tor M.|last=Nondal|coauthors=Kirknes, Magnar|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=27 June 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Hordaland had considered it.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hordaland FpU vurdere brudd|first=Per Jon|last=Odeen|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=24 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> National deputy Ole Tom Nomeland was reluctant to comment,<ref name=leggned/> but at the national convention he called Ellen Wibe "one of the finest people in Norwegian politics".<ref>{{cite news|title=H<U+00F8>rt p<U+00E5> Bolkesj<U+00F8>|first=|last=|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=16 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He was threatened with exclusion in June, ahead of the convention.<ref name=dolkest/>

Two days before the national convention, the central committee convened and supported a dissolution of the Youth of the Progress Party.<ref name=yes-dissolve>{{cite news|title=Enstemmig sentralstyre: G<U+00E5>r inn for <U+00E5> oppl<U+00F8>se Fp.U.|first=Audun|last=St<U+00F8>ren|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=30 June 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Lars Erik Gr<U+00F8>nntun even announced plans to cooperate more with the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives]] and the [[Young Liberals of Norway]].<ref>{{cite news|title=<U+2013> Oppf<U+00F8>rer seg som SUF (ML)|first=St<U+00E5>l|last=Talsnes|coauthors=S<U+00F8>nstelie, Rolf; Henden, Harald|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=30 June 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Young Conservatives leader [[Andr<U+00E9> St<U+00F8>ylen]] was not negative.<ref name=yes-dissolve/>

The national convention agreed on dissolving the Youth of the Progress Party, with 63 against 21 votes. Hagen-loyal members summoned the Progress Party national board, which overruled the decision, allowing the remaining members to continue with [[Ulf Leirstein]] as leader.<ref name=fpuleaves>{{cite news|title=Fremskrittspartiet mister nesten en hel generasjon|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=2 July 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Other defections===
Already before the national convention, the entire local party chapter in [[Oster<U+00F8>y]] was disestablished, but mainly due to the European Union controversy. The party had one representative in Oster<U+00F8>y [[municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=FrP-laget p<U+00E5> Oster<U+00F8>y nedlagt|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=19 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> One day after the national convention, delegate [[Kristian Eidesvik]] announced his withdrawal from the party, though he would sit through his tenure as member of Hordaland [[county council (Norway)|county council]], which lasted until 1995. Eidesvik was a former member of the central board,<ref>{{cite news|title=Eidesvik melder seg ut|first=|last=|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|date=18 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> and also a former deputy member of Parliament.<ref>{{stortingetbio|KREI|name=Kristian Eidesvik}}</ref> The same day former MP and youth wing leader [[P<U+00E5>l Atle Skjervengen]] withdrew, commenting that the libertarians "are asked by the party leadership to go to hell".<ref name=skjervengen/> Skjervengen had been criticized by Carl I. Hagen from the rostrum at the national convention.<ref name=hevn/> Many years down the road Skjervengen joined the Conservative Party.<ref>{{cite news |first=Gunnar |last=Magnus |title=Fra Frp til H<U+00F8>yre |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article1772790.ece |work=Aftenposten |date=6 May 2007 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=17 August 2007 }}</ref> Harald Eide Ellingsen, member of [[Stavanger]] city council, also left.<ref>{{cite news|title=Limi: Forventer intet ras av utmeldinger fra FrP|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=19 April 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In [[R<U+00F8>yken]] municipal council, three of five representatives left the party, and a fourth, former MP Steinar Maribo, considered doing the same. As did Odd Magnar Brub<U+00E6>k,<ref>{{cite news|title=Fr.p. revner helt, fire p<U+00E5> Tinget vil trolig fristille seg|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=3 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> and former deputy MP [[Paal Bj<U+00F8>rnestad]].<ref name=organize>{{cite news|title=Utbryterne fra Fr.p. vil organisere seg|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=6 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Terje Nyberget withdrew from the central committee in early May.<ref name=tusenvis/> The leader in the chapters in Finnmark and Nordkapp, Bj<U+00F8>rn Magne Solvik, withdrew on 13 May. He cited a lack of liberalism, especially with regards to gay rights and immigration, as the reason.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fylkesformann i Finnmark FrP melder seg ut av partiet|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=13 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He was the only Progress Party member of a municipal council in Finnmark.<ref>{{cite news|title=Frp-Finnmark|first=|last=|work=[[Nordlys]]|date=14 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Maribo withdrew some time in May. In late May, party secretary [[Hans Andreas Limi]] had counted 270 withdrawals, but also 76 new members.<ref name=juni>{{cite news|title=Fr.p.-utbrytere organiserer seg i juni|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=29 May 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Municipal and county council member Liv Skrede left after the youth wing's national convention in July,<ref>{{cite news|title=Det endelige oppgj<U+00F8>r|first=Liv|last=Skrede|work=[[Aftenposten Aften]]|date=11 July 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> so did Tor Mikkel Wara,<ref>{{cite news|title=Nedlagt og gjenf<U+00F8>dt|first=Talsnes|last=St<U+00E5>l|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=3 July 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Ellen Wibe, Jan Erik F<U+00E5>ne and Petter Bj<U+00F8>rheim.<ref name=fpuleaves/> Hordaland county council member Lene C.

===New party===
Already during the national convention, the Youth of the Progress Party agreed to form an informal "thinking group" for disenfranchised members.<ref name=organize/> P<U+00E5>l Atle Skjervengen was early in declaring an interest in forming a new, libertarian party.<ref name=skjervengen/> Those who resigned from the parliamentary group initially declared a lack of motivation to form a new party,<ref name=presse/> and they also rejected the possibility of joining another party. They would instead vote according to the 1993 party program.<ref name=halveres/> Either way, in a parliamentary context they were known as [[Independent (politician)|independents]] for the remainder of their term.<ref>{{stortingetbio|SB|name=Stephen Br<U+00E5>then}} Retrieved 29 March 2010.</ref><ref>{{stortingetbio|ECC|name=Ellen Chr.

Organizations in Akershus and Buskerud already existed, under the names of ''Fridemokratene Akershus'' and ''Buskerud Liberale Forum''.<ref name=juni/>

At the conference, the name [[Free Democrats (Norway)|Free Democrats]] ({{lang-no|Fridemokratene}}) was adopted, and the band of four were chosen as leaders. Two hundred people joined, and it had four county leaders; Per Aage Pleym Christensen for Akershus, Geir Thoresen for Buskerud, the former city council secretary Roy Venge Tollefsen in Oslo and Thor Simonsen in <U+00D8>stfold. Wibe, on the other hand, left politics,<ref name=fridem-june>{{cite news|title=FrP-utbrytere danner Fridemokratene|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=19 June 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> as did Lars Erik Gr<U+00F8>nntun.<ref name=fpuleaves/> The board members of Aust-Agder Youth of the Progress Party joined the Free Democrats in August.<ref>{{cite news|title=Utmeldte FrP-ungdommer inn i Fridemokratene|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=28 August 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Ellen Christine Christiansen stated that "time will tell whether we become a political party".<ref name=fridem-june/> The issue was discussed again at a national convention in September 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ikke nytt fridemokratisk parti forel<U+00F8>pig|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=20 September 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The Vestfold chapter wanted to field in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1997]] with Oscar Hillgaar on the ballot,<ref>{{cite news|title=Fridemokratene i Vestfold vil stille til valg|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=27 August 1994|language=Norwegian}}</ref> but this did not happen.
