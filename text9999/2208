'''Grameen Foundation''', founded as ''Grameen Foundation USA'', is a global [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington DC]] that works to replicate the [[Grameen Bank]] [[microfinance]] model around the world through a global network of partner [[microfinance institution]]s.  Its CEO is [[Alex Counts]].

== History ==

The Foundation was founded in 1997 as a vehicle to replicate the model of [[Grameen Bank]] beyond the borders of [[Bangladesh]] and increase the access of poor people to microfinance by millions worldwide.  [[Muhammad Yunus]], the founder and managing director of Grameen Bank, sits on the Board of Directors. Current chair of the board is [[Paul Maritz]], CEO of [[VMWare]] and formerly a senior executive at [[Microsoft]].

== Mission ==

== Programs ==
Rather than directly administering microfinance programs, Grameen Foundation provides funds and technical assistance to local and regional microfinance institutions (MFIs) and other poverty-focused organizations. Grameen Foundation works with these organizations to:

* Help them find financing, either through loan-guarantee programs (Growth Guarantees) or direct funding (Pioneer Fund)
* Improve their IT systems, through [[Mifos]], its open-source MIS software
* Ensure that their staff are as productive as possible, through services and consulting provided by its Human Capital Center
* Measure whether their efforts are reaching the poor, though its Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI)

Working with local and global allies, Grameen Foundation also develops and distributes mobile phone-based applications to help the poor to better manage:

* Their health, through such programs as the Mobile Technology for Community Health (MOTECH) initiative in Ghana
* Their crops, through such programs as the Community Knowledge Worker initiative in Uganda
* Their finances, though such programs as the Mobile Money initiative in Kenya

Grameen Foundation also works to help the poor receive training and benefit from small-business opportunities, further enabling them to improve their lives and break the cycle of poverty for themselves and their families. <ref name=09annrpt/>
