'''New York State Route&nbsp;17M''' ('''NY&nbsp;17M''') is an east&ndash;west [[state highway]] in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], [[New York]], in the United States. It extends for {{convert|26.63|mi|2}} from west of the city of [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] to what is currently the north&ndash;south section of [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] just southeast of the village of [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]]. It is a busy main street in Middletown and the [[Monroe (village), New York|village of Monroe]]; in the former, it divides into a parkway for several blocks and forms the city's major commercial strip, located between the downtown district and an interchange with [[Interstate 84 in New York|Interstate&nbsp;84]] (I-84). The rest of the road is a two-lane rural route. Between [[New Hampton, New York|New Hampton]] and [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]], the highway [[concurrency (road)|overlaps]] with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;6]] (US&nbsp;6). The easternmost section of that overlap near Goshen is routed on the Quickway, making a three-route concurrency with NY&nbsp;17.

Most of NY&nbsp;17M follows the course used by NY&nbsp;17 prior to the construction of the Quickway through the [[Catskill Mountains]]. The first section of the Quickway opened in 1951 and extended from [[Fair Oaks, New York|Fair Oaks]] to Goshen. NY&nbsp;17M was initially assigned to NY&nbsp;17's old surface routing between Fair Oaks and Middletown; however, it was extended east to Harriman and, for a brief time, northwest to [[Wurtsboro, New York|Wurtsboro]] as more sections of the freeway were completed.

==Route description==
The portions of NY&nbsp;17M that lie north and east of the city of [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] are maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT). Within the Middletown city limits, NY&nbsp;17M is city-maintained.<ref name="inv-orange">{{cite web |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_orange.csv |title=Orange County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>

===Wallkill and Middletown===
County Route&nbsp;76 (CR&nbsp;76) becomes NY&nbsp;17M when the highway passes through the site of a former [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] (once exit&nbsp;118A) with the nearby [[Quickway]] ([[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]]) in the town of [[Wallkill, Orange County, New York|Wallkill]], located in northern [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]].<ref name="yahoo-w">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=41.46015&lon=-74.427855&zoom=14&q1=41.504345%2C-74.410943&q2=41.464837%2C-74.413593&q3=41.454545%2C-74.413722&q4=41.447915%2C-74.431328&q5=41.440263%2C-74.419988 |title=overview map of NY 17K from CR 76 to Middletown |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="wurtsboro quad">{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=bb43 |title=Wurtsboro Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1991 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref> The junction was just north of the former [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]],<ref>{{cite map |url=http://docs.unh.edu/NY/elln06sw.jpg |title=New York <U+2013> Ellenville Quadrangle |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |scale=1:62,500 |year=1906 |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref> which NY&nbsp;17M crosses as it makes its way southward over some gentle, lightly developed hills. After {{convert|0.5|mi|1}}, the road reaches a signalized intersection with [[New York State Route 302|NY&nbsp;302]], its first junction with another state highway. The junction currently serves as NY&nbsp;302's southern terminus;<ref name="yahoo-w" /> however, NY&nbsp;302 once continued south to [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] by way of an [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with NY&nbsp;17M.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1960}}</ref> Continuing on, NY&nbsp;17M traverses increasingly developed areas, passing through the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Rockville on its way to the densely populated neighborhood of [[Washington Heights, New York|Washington Heights]], situated just outside of Middletown.<ref name="yahoo-w" />

[[File:NY 17M parkway in Middletown.jpg|left|thumb|Fulton Avenue parkway in Middletown]]
The route seamlessly passes from Washington Heights to Middletown, where it becomes known as North Street. The street is initially fairly wide<U+2014>featuring shoulders on each side<U+2014>but it narrows in the residential neighborhoods closer to the city's center. Upon reaching the northern edge of Middletown's central business district, the route turns right onto Wickham Avenue, which carries [[New York State Route 211|NY&nbsp;211]] through northern Middletown. The resulting overlap between NY&nbsp;17M and NY&nbsp;211 is a [[wrong-way concurrency]]: NY&nbsp;17M eastbound is concurrent with NY&nbsp;211 westbound and vice versa. Routes&nbsp;17M and&nbsp;211 head west along the fringe of downtown, climbing slightly in elevation as the street passes through mostly residential areas. After seven blocks, Wickham Avenue merges into West Main Street; however, the road's surroundings remain unchanged.<ref name="yahoo-w" />

NY&nbsp;17M and NY&nbsp;211 continue along West Main Street for another four blocks, traversing a slight westerly turn in the street prior to intersecting Monhagen Avenue in the western part of the city. Both routes leave Main Street here: NY&nbsp;211 turns right, following the road northwest toward [[Otisville, New York|Otisville]] while NY&nbsp;17M heads left, proceeding southeastward toward downtown. It continues through a six-block commercial and residential area to Mill Street, at which point Monhagen Avenue becomes Fulton Street and expands to become a [[parkway]] with a tree-lined [[central reservation|median strip]]. This stretch continues for five blocks along the southern edge of downtown Middletown to Academy Avenue, where NY&nbsp;17M turns right and heads southward. After just two blocks, the route changes streets for the final time in Middletown, veering left onto Dolson Avenue.<ref name="yahoo-w" />

===East of Middletown===
[[File:US 6-NY 17M in Wallkill Valley.jpg|thumb|Descent to the Wallkill]]
As Dolson Avenue, NY&nbsp;17M passes by a single residential block before entering a linear commercial district that follows the highway to an interchange with [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84]] roughly {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} to the south. The route initially remains two lanes wide, but widens to four lanes after crossing the [[Middletown and New Jersey Railway]] at-grade. This stretch of NY&nbsp;17M also features a [[center left-turn lane]] to accommodate the traffic turning into the many commercial plazas on either side. The road remains within the Middletown city limits until a block before the intersection where [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] comes in from the west and joins NY&nbsp;17M. Together, they cross over I-84 at exit&nbsp;3, providing access to the cities of [[Port Jervis, New York|Port Jervis]] and [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]] in the western and eastern parts of the county, respectively.<ref name="yahoo-e">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=41.352141&lon=-74.241711&zoom=13&q1=41.440263%2C-74.419988&q2=41.406925%2C-74.403594&q3=41.370704%2C-74.289911&q4=41.351506%2C-74.246266&q5=41.326889%2C-74.189961&q6=41.302391%2C-74.145458 |title=overview map of NY 17M from Middletown to Woodbury |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>

Just past I-84, the [[Wawayanda, New York|Wawayanda]] hamlet of [[New Hampton, New York|New Hampton]] begins, with car dealerships and other commercial establishments on either side. The road narrows to two lanes as the combined highways begin a slow, gentle descent through less developed areas to the bridge over the [[Wallkill River]], situated at the northern tip of the county's [[Black Dirt Region]]. Short sections of the approach on either side add a passing lane in the uphill direction. The river marks the [[Goshen (town), New York|Goshen town]] line, and the slight climb out of the river depression is accompanied again with some extra lanes. Past the climb, development aside the road picks up slightly, although most of the land around the highway remains undeveloped as open fields or forests. US&nbsp;6 and NY&nbsp;17M continue to the western outskirts of the [[Goshen (village), New York|village of Goshen]], where they merge into NY&nbsp;17 at exit&nbsp;123.<ref name="yahoo-e" />

[[File:NY 17M at Brookview Farm, Chester, NY.jpg|thumb|left|Rural scenes in Chester]]
NY&nbsp;17M follows the Quickway for about {{convert|1|mi|1}}, meeting [[New York State Route 17A|NY&nbsp;17A]] and [[New York State Route 207|NY&nbsp;207]] at an interchange (exit&nbsp;124) in a commercialized area southwest of the center of Goshen. It ultimately leaves the Quickway before US&nbsp;6 does, splitting from the highway at exit&nbsp;125. From here to the [[Chester (village), New York|village of Chester]], NY&nbsp;17M closely follows the NY&nbsp;17 freeway, serving a handful of homes in an otherwise undeveloped area adjacent to the Quickway. In Chester, NY&nbsp;17M becomes Brookside Avenue and intersects with [[New York State Route 94|NY&nbsp;94]] in the commercial center of the community. It continues on, passing through the rural areas of the southern portion of the town of [[Blooming Grove, New York|Blooming Grove]] prior to becoming heavily developed as it passes into the [[Monroe (town), New York|town of Monroe]].<ref name="yahoo-e" />

Just inside the town line, NY&nbsp;17M turns southward, leaving the vicinity of the Quickway and entering the [[Monroe (village), New York|village of Monroe]]. It bypasses the downtown portion of the village and its [[Village of Monroe Historic District|historic district]] to the west and south. Despite this fact, it still serves as one of the community's major commercial strips, intersecting [[New York State Route 208|NY&nbsp;208]] in a built-up area due west of downtown. The route continues to the east, serving commercial and residential areas on its way to the nearby village of [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]]. Development abates slightly past Harriman as NY&nbsp;17M continues with a slight southward bent towards its final junction with NY&nbsp;17 just outside of the Harriman village limits in the town and village of [[Woodbury, Orange County, New York|Woodbury]].<ref name="yahoo-e" />

==History==
===Origins and designation===
What is now NY&nbsp;17M was originally designated as part of Route&nbsp;4 by the [[New York State Legislature]] in 1908. The unsigned [[legislative route]] extended across the [[Southern Tier]] of New York, beginning near the shores of [[Lake Erie]] in [[Westfield (village), New York|Westfield]] and ending at the [[Hudson River]] in [[Highland Falls, New York|Highland Falls]].<ref name="1909book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

Lyon Company |location=Albany, New York |pages=502<U+2013>505 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref> The first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, at which time most of legislative Route&nbsp;4 was designated as [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 21, 1924 |page=XX9}}</ref><ref name="1926map">{{cite map |title=Official Map Showing State Highways and other important roads |year=1926 |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref> While Route&nbsp;4 went northeast from [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]],<ref name="1920book" /> NY&nbsp;17 continued south from the village toward the [[New Jersey]] state line.<ref name="1926map" />

In the late 1940s, construction began on the [[Quickway]], a [[limited-access highway]] connecting [[Binghamton (city), New York|Binghamton]] to Harriman by way of the NY&nbsp;17 corridor. The first portion to be built was the section between exit&nbsp;118A in [[Fair Oaks, New York|Fair Oaks]] and exit&nbsp;123 near [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]],<ref>{{cite map |title=Official Highway Map of New York State |publisher=State of New York Department of Public Works |edition=1947<U+2013>48 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=General Drafting |edition=1950 |year=1949}}</ref> which opened to traffic in July 1951.<ref name="1958nyt">{{cite news |title=Paving The Way To The Catskills |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |date=October 19, 1958 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=X30}}</ref> NY&nbsp;17 was subsequently realigned to bypass [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] to the northeast on the new freeway while the former routing of NY&nbsp;17 between [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] south of Middletown and the new Fair Oaks interchange was redesignated as NY&nbsp;17M. The remainder of old NY&nbsp;17 from Middletown to Goshen remained part of US&nbsp;6, which had [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped with NY&nbsp;17 between Middletown and Goshen.<ref name="1952map">{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1952}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Socony-Vacuum Oil Company]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1950}}</ref>

[[File:NY 17MEasternTerminus.jpg|right|thumb|NY&nbsp;17M's eastern terminus at NY&nbsp;17 in Harriman.]]
The Goshen<U+2013>[[Chester (village), New York|Chester]] and Chester<U+2013>[[Harriman, New York|Harriman]] segments of the Quickway were completed in October 1954 and August 1955, respectively, creating a continuous limited-access highway between Fair Oaks and the [[New York State Thruway]].<ref name="1958nyt" /> US&nbsp;6 and NY&nbsp;17 were moved onto the highway as sections opened to traffic, while NY&nbsp;17M was extended eastward along NY&nbsp;17's old routing to Harriman following the completion of the Quickway between Chester and the Thruway.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=Esso |cartography=General Drafting |edition=1955<U+2013>56 |year=1954}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=Esso |cartography=General Drafting |edition=1957 |year=1956}}</ref> On October&nbsp;23, 1958, the portion of the Quickway between Fair Oaks and [[Wurtsboro, New York|Wurtsboro]] (exit&nbsp;114) was completed as part of a realigned NY&nbsp;17.

===Realignment and ramp closure===
NY&nbsp;17M originally followed a slightly different alignment through downtown Middletown. When the route was first assigned, it continued south from Wickham Avenue on North Street, proceeding into what was then the main commercial hub of the city. The highway rejoined its modern alignment at the intersection of South Street and Fulton Street south of downtown.<ref name="middletown topo">{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/usgspreview/index.cfm?code=o41074d4 |title=Middletown Quadrangle <U+2013> New York <U+2013> Orange Co. |publisher=United States Geological Survey |series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) |year=1976 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref> In 1969, the city of Middletown began planning a project that would rehabilitate part of North Street.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RVtGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xicNAAAAIBAJ&dq=middletown%20north-street%201969&pg=2531%2C5345652 |title=Middletown North Street Renewal Next |last=Albert |first=Myron |date=May 28, 1969 |newspaper=The Evening News |page=8A |accessdate=February 18, 2011 |location=[[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh, New York]]}}</ref> As part of the project, the section of North Street between Orchard Street and Main Street would be closed to traffic and converted into a [[pedestrian mall]]. The street was closed in early 1970, forcing NY&nbsp;17M to be realigned onto Wickham Avenue, West Main Street, and Monhagen Avenue.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=poJGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zywNAAAAIBAJ&dq=middletown%20north%20street&pg=5991%2C1617710 |title=Middletown Plaza Plan Due Airing |date=January 12, 1970 |newspaper=The Evening News |page=8A |accessdate=February 18, 2011 |location=Newburgh, New York}}</ref> The pedestrian mall project faced opposition from business owners, leading to its cancellation on February&nbsp;9, 1970.

When the Quickway was first built, exit&nbsp;118A was made up of two ramps, one leading from NY&nbsp;17 eastbound to NY&nbsp;17M and another connecting NY&nbsp;17M westbound to NY&nbsp;17 westbound.<ref>{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/usgspreview/index.cfm?code=o41074e4 |title=Wurtsboro Quadrangle <U+2013> New York |publisher=United States Geological Survey |series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) |year=1976 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}</ref> The exit was eliminated at some point after 1996. The westbound on-ramp was converted into a residential street known as Sands Road West while the eastbound half of the exit was completely removed. As a result, NY&nbsp;17M's western terminus is no longer at an intersecting road. Instead, the highway simply changes from a state highway to a county road at the former site of the exit.<ref name="yahoo-w" /><ref name="wurtsboro quad" />
