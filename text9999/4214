'''Grsync''' is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for [[rsync]], the most used directory synchronization tool under Linux / Unix System.
Grsync is released under the [[GPL]] license, so it is [[OpenSource]], and makes use of the [[GTK]] libraries.
It doesn't support all of rsync features, but can be effectively used to synchronize local directories and supports remote targets in a limited way.
