The '''Battle of Pell's Point''' (October 18, 1776), also known as the '''Battle of Pelham''', was a skirmish fought between British and American troops during the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The conflict took place in what is now part of [[Pelham Bay Park]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]].

On October 12, British forces landed at [[Throgs Neck]] in order to execute a [[flanking maneuver]] that would trap [[General of the Armies of the United States|Gen.]] [[George Washington]], [[Commander-in-chief#United States|commander-in-chief]] of the American revolutionary forces, and the main body of the [[Continental Army]] on the island of [[Manhattan]]. The landing was thwarted by the Americans, and British commander [[General (United Kingdom)|Gen.]] [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]], [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|commander-in-chief]] of British forces in North America, looked for another location along [[Long Island Sound]] to disembark his troops.  On October 18, he landed 4,000 men at [[Pelham (village), New York|Pelham]], {{convert|3|mi|km}} north of Throgs Neck. Inland were 750 men of a brigade under the command of Col. [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]].  Glover positioned his troops behind a series of stone walls, and attacked the British advance units.  As the British overran each position, the American troops fell back and reorganized behind the next wall.  After several such attacks, the British broke off and the Americans retreated.

The battle delayed British movements long enough for Washington to move the main army to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], avoiding being surrounded on Manhattan. After losing to the British in a [[Battle of White Plains|battle at White Plains]], and [[Battle of Fort Washington|losing Fort Washington]], Washington retreated across [[New Jersey]] to [[Pennsylvania]].

==Background==
{{main|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
After a victory at the [[Battle of Long Island]] in late August, the [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|commander-in-chief]] of British forces in North America, [[General (United Kingdom)|Gen.]] [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed his troops]] at [[Kips Bay|Kip's Bay]], on the eastern shore of present-day [[Manhattan]], on September 15.<ref>McCullough, p. 209</ref>  [[George Washington]] and his army retreated to [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Harlem Heights]], a [[plateau]] situated on the north end of Manhattan Island.<ref name="Ward246">Ward, p. 246.</ref>  Washington was in a good defensive position, with his rear guarded on two sides by rocky heights and the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Harlem River]]s, and with more rocky heights to the south between his forces and the British.<ref name="Ward246"/>  The next day, the British attacked the Americans and were defeated at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]].  There was very little action for the next month,<ref name="a1">Abbatt, p. 1</ref> while the two forces remained in their fortified positions, each unable to decide upon their next move.<ref name="Ward253">Ward, p. 253.</ref> The Americans believed that Howe would either attack [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]], or attempt to flank the Americans with a landing at some point on [[Long Island Sound]].<ref name="Ward253"/> A council-of-war decided to guard against both possibilities;  Washington kept 10,000 men to defend Harlem Heights and Fort Washington, Maj. Gen. [[William Heath]] took 10,000 troops to defend [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]], and Maj. Gen. [[Nathanael Greene]] was given 5,000 troops to defend the other side of the Hudson River, near Fort Constitution.<ref name="Ward253"/>

After 26 days of contemplation, Howe decided against a [[Frontal assault|frontal attack]] on Harlem Heights and Fort Washington, and chose instead to attempt a [[flanking maneuver]].<ref name="Ward255">Ward, p. 255.</ref>  On October 12, leaving behind three brigades under the command of Lord [[Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Percy]] on Manhattan Island, Howe embarked his main army in eighty vessels and proceeded up the [[East River]], through [[Hell Gate]], and landed at [[Throggs Neck|Throgs Neck]].<ref name="Ward255"/>  Throgs Neck&mdash;originally known as Throckmorton's, and also known as Throck's, Frog's Neck and Frog's Point<ref name="Ward255"/>&mdash;is a narrow [[spit (landform)|spit]] of land that sits between the East River and Long Island Sound.  Conveniently for Howe, there was a road running from Throgs Neck to Kingsbridge, directly behind the American forces.<ref name="Ward255"/>  Howe hoped to use this road to flank the Americans, and pin them against the Hudson River.<ref name="Ward255"/>

Under the cover of fog, an advance force of 4,000 men under the command of General [[Henry Clinton (1730<U+2013>1795)|Henry Clinton]] was landed on Throgs Neck.<ref name="Ward255"/>  To their dismay, they found that they were not on a [[peninsula]], but on an island, separated from the mainland by a creek and a [[marsh]].  There were two ways to get to the mainland&mdash;a [[causeway]] and bridge at the lower end, and a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] at the other.<ref name="Ward255"/>  The Americans were guarding both.  Col. [[Edward Hand]] and a detachment of 25 men from the [[1st Pennsylvania Regiment]] positioned themselves behind a length of [[firewood|cordwood]] along the causeway, after having removed the planks of wood from the bridge.<ref name="Ward255"/> They surprised the British troops, who fell back and made an attempt to cross at the ford, which was guarded by another detachment.<ref name="Ward255"/>  The Americans guarding both positions were quickly reinforced, and the defenders soon numbered over 1,800 men.<ref name="Ward255"/>  Howe decided it would be better to retreat and land somewhere else.<ref name="m230">McCullough, p. 230.</ref>  He made camp on Throgs Neck, and remained there for six days while supplies and reinforcements, including 7,000 [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] soldiers under the command of Gen. [[Wilhelm von Knyphausen]], were brought up from New York.<ref name="Ward256">Ward, p. 256.</ref>  Just after midnight on October 18, Howe embarked his army again,<ref name="m230">McCullough, p. 230</ref> and decided to land at Pell's Point near the town of [[Pelham (village), New York|Pelham]], a few miles to the north.<ref name="a5">Abbatt, p. 5.</ref>

After hearing of the landing on Throgs Neck, Washington knew that he risked entrapment on Manhattan.<ref name="m230" /> He made the decision to move his army to [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], where he believed they would be safe.  By October 17, the [[Continental Army]] was on its way to White Plains,<ref>McCullough, p. 231.</ref> leaving behind 2,000 men to garrison Fort Washington.<ref name="Ward256"/>

==Battle==
[[File:glover-statue.jpg|thumb|right|200px|right|Statue of Glover on [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston]]]]
At dawn, the British began to land on the shore, Clinton's advance guard of 4,000 British light infantry and Hessian [[j<U+00E4>ger (military)|j<U+00E4>ger]]s landing first.<ref name="m232">McCullough, p. 232</ref><ref name="a5">Abbatt, p. 5</ref> Inland, opposing them, was a brigade of some 750 men under the command of [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]]. Glover was on the top of a hill with a telescope when he noticed the British ships.<ref name="a6">Abbatt, p. 6</ref> Glover sent an officer, Major William Lee, to report to [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], Washington's second in command, and ask for orders. However, Lee did not give any orders and in the absence of orders Glover chose to attack.<ref name="a11">Abbatt, p. 11</ref> Glover turned out his brigade, which consisted of the [[14th Continental Regiment|14th]], [[13th Continental Regiment|13th]], 3rd and the [[26th Continental Regiment]]s. Glover left the 150 men of the 14th Continentals behind in reserve.<ref name="a11" /><ref name="b116">Billias, p. 116</ref> Glover had not closed half the distance when he ran into approximately 30 skirmishers.<ref name="b116" /> Glover ordered a Captain and his 40 man company forward as an advance guard to hold the British in check while Glover organized the rest of the force.<ref name="a11" />

Glover prepared an ambush by placing the main body in staggered positions behind the stone walls that lined either side of the laneway that led from the beachhead to the interior.  Glover instructed each of the regiments to hold their position as long as they could and then to fall back to a position in the rear while the next unit took up the fighting.<ref name="b117">Billias, p. 117</ref> Glover then rode up to take command of the advance guard. The advance guard and the British began to engage each other, both side taking casualties.<ref name="a13">Abbatt, p. 13</ref> After a little while the British were reinforced, and Glover ordered a retreat, which was done without confusion. The British troops began to advance at the retreating Americans, however, the 200 troops of the 13th Continentals that Glover had stationed behind the stone wall stood up and fired at the British when there were only 30 yards away.<ref name="a14">Abbatt, p. 14</ref> The ambush worked, and the column of British troops took heavy losses and fell back to the main body of the invading army.<ref name="a14" />
[[File:William-howe-fifth-viscount.jpg|left|thumb|William Howe, leader of the British force at the Battle of Pell's Point]]
The British waited a half an hour before attacking again.<ref name="a15">Abbatt, p. 15</ref> This time when they attacked, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. The British bombarded the American position behind the stone wall as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective and when the British were 50 yards away the Americans fired a volley which stopped the British infantry.<ref name="a15" /> The British returned fire and musket and rifle fire ensued for twenty minutes, the British supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind the stone wall on the opposite side of the road.<ref name="a15">Abbatt p.15</ref><ref name="b118">Billias, p. 118</ref>

The British attacked the position of the 3rd Continentals and an engagement ensued.<ref name="a16">Abbatt, p. 16</ref> Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.<ref name="a17">Abbatt, p. 17</ref><ref name="b119">Billias, p. 119</ref> 

A reconnaissance party of 30 men was sent out from behind the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position.<ref name="a17" /> The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British.<ref name="a18">Abbatt, p. 18</ref> Howe camped on a hill on the opposite side of the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.<ref name="a18" />

==Aftermath==
[[File:Towhiteplains.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The British movements from Pell's Point to White Plains.]]
The next day, Glover and his force retreated to the town of [[Yonkers]].<ref name="a18">Abbatt p.18</ref> American casualties were 8 killed and 13 wounded.<ref name="m232" /> British and Hessian casualties are not known.<ref name="m232" />  Howe's official dispatch listed British casualties as 3 killed and 20 wounded, although the report did not include Hessian casualties.  As the Hessians made up the majority of the landing force, it is reasonable to expect they made up the majority of the casualties.<ref name="b120">Billias, p. 120</ref> Over the next few days, from knowledge collected from British deserters, the Americans estimated that the British lost between 800 and 1,000 killed or wounded, likely an exaggeration.<ref name="a20">Abbatt, p. 20</ref> Colonel [[Loammi Baldwin]], who was present at the battle, estimated that the Americans had killed 200 British and Hessians, but historian [[David McCullough]] says this was "undoubtedly an exaggeration."<ref name="m232"/> Historian [[George Athan Billias]] argues in support of Baldwin's estimates, due in part to the corroborating admission of another British deserter.<ref name="b121">Billias, p. 121</ref> Regardless, the combined British and Hessian casualties were almost certainly larger than those of the Americans.<ref name="m232" />

With the British advance delayed, the main American army under Washington was able to safely evacuate from Harlem on the island of Manhattan to White Plains.<ref name="m233">McCullough, p. 233</ref> Howe slowly moved his army through New Rochelle and Scarsdale, and next attacked Washington's army on October 28, when he sent 13,000 men to attack the Americans, resulting in a minor victory at the [[Battle of White Plains]].<ref name="m233" /> Fort Washington, the last American stronghold on Manhattan, fell on November 16.<ref>McCullough, p. 241</ref> With these defeats, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, paving the way for the Battles of [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]].<ref>McCullough, p. 290</ref>
