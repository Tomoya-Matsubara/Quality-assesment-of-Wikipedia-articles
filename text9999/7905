The '''turquoise parrot''' (''Neophema pulchella'') is a [[parrot]] of the grass parrot genus ''[[Neophema]]'' native to Eastern Australia, from southeastern [[Queensland]], through [[New South Wales]] and into north-eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. A small parrot at around 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) long, it exhibits [[sexual dimorphism]]. The male is predominantly green in colour and more yellowish below with a bright turquoise blue face and red shoulders on the predominantly blue wings. The female is generally duller and paler, with a pale green breast and yellow belly, and lacks the red wing patch.

Found in grasslands and open woodlands dominated by ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and ''[[Callitris]]'' species, the turquoise parrot feeds on grasses, seeds and nectar. It nests in hollows of gum trees. Much of its habitat has been altered and potential nesting sites removed. Predominantly sedentary, the turquoise parrot can be locally nomadic. Populations appear to be recovering from a crash in the early 20th century. The turquoise parrot has been kept in captivity since the 19th century, and several colour variants exist.

==Description==
Ranging from 20 to 22 cm (8<U+2013>8{{frac|3|4}} in) long with a {{convert|32|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wingspan, the turquoise parrot is a small and slightly-built parrot weighing around {{convert|40|g|abbr=on|frac=4}} Both sexes have predominantly green upperparts and yellow underparts. The male has a bright turquoise-blue face which is darkest on the crown and slightly paler on the [[Lore (anatomy)|lores]], cheeks and ear [[Covert feather|coverts]]. Its neck and upperparts are grass-green, and its tail is grass-green with yellow borders. The wing appears bright blue with a darker leading edge when folded, with a band of red on the shoulder. The underparts are bright yellow, slightly greenish on the breast and neck. Some males have orange patches on the belly, which may extend to the breast. When extended, the wing is dark blue with red on its trailing edge on the upper surface, and black with dark blue leading coverts underneath. The upper mandible of the bill is black and may or may not fade to grey at the base, while the lower mandible is cream with a grey border in the mouth. The [[beak#cere|cere]] and orbital ring are grey and the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is dark brown. The legs and feet are grey.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=573}}<!-- cites para -->

Generally duller and paler, the female has a more uniform and paler blue face, with highly contrasting cream bare skin around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and its blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct. The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper mandible is paler brown-grey with a darker tip, and has been recorded as black while nesting. The lower mandible is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad white bar visible on its underwing.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=573}}<!-- cites para -->

Juvenile birds of both sexes have less extensive blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts resemble the adult female.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=582}} Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lendon, Alan | title= The" Wing-stripe" as an Indication of Sex and Maturity in the Australian Broad-tailed Parrots |journal= South Australian Ornithologist |volume=15 |year=1940|pages= 87<U+2013>94 [93] |issn=0038-2973}}</ref> The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may also have an orange wash on the belly.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=582}}

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Unidentified parrot -Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire, England-8a.jpg|right|thumb|Adult male, Twycross Zoo]]
The turquoise parrot is found in the foothills of the [[Great Dividing Range]] and surrounding areas.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=574}} The northern limit of its range is 26<U+00B0> south in southeastern Queensland, around [[Shire of Cooloola|Cooloola]], [[Blackbutt, Queensland|Blackbutt]] and [[Chinchilla, Queensland|Chinchilla]], extending westwards to the vicinity of [[St George, Queensland|St George]]. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the [[Suttor River]] and [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]]. In New South Wales, it is found in a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]], [[Quambone, New South Wales|Quambone]], [[Hillston, New South Wales|Hillston]], [[Narrandera]] and [[Deniliquin]]. There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. In Victoria it is found in the vicinity of [[Wangaratta]] as well as [[East Gippsland]] and around [[Mallacoota, Victoria|Mallacoota]].<{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=575}} Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot,<{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=575}} the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.{{sfn|Lendon|1973|p=253}}

The turquoise parrot inhabits open woodland and [[savanna]] woodland composed either of native cypress (''[[Callitris]]'' species) or eucalypts, particularly white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens]]''), yellow box (''[[Eucalyptus melliodora|E. melliodora]]''), Blakely's red gum (''[[Eucalyptus blakelyi|E. blakelyi]]''), red box (''[[Eucalyptus polyanthemos|E. polyanthemos]]''), red stringybark (''[[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha|E. macrorhyncha]]''), bimble box (''[[Eucalyptus populnea|E. populnea]]''), or mugga ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus sideroxylon|E. sideroxylon]]''), and less commonly ''[[Angophora]]'' near Sydney, silvertop ash forest (''[[Eucalyptus sieberi|E. sieberi]]'') in [[Nadgee Nature Reserve]], and stands of river red gum  (''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis|E. camaldulensis]]''), mountain swamp gum (''[[Eucalyptus camphora|E. camphora]]'') or western grey box (''[[Eucalyptus microcarpa|E. microcarpa]]'') in flatter more open areas. Within this habitat, it prefers rocky ridges or gullies, or transitional areas between different habitats, such as between woodland and grassland or fields in cultivated areas.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=574}}<!-- cites para -->

The turquoise parrot is considered sedentary and does not migrate, though its movements are not well known. Birds are present in some areas all year, though in northern Victoria are thought to move into more open areas outside the breeding season. Some populations may be locally nomadic, following availability of water.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=576}}

==Conservation status==

===Australia===
The turquoise parrot  is not listed as threatened on the Commonwealth [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]], though it has been classified as ''near threatened'' by Garnett and Crowley in 2000.<ref name=GarnettCrowley>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/action/birds2000/pubs/turquoise-parrot.pdf | title=Turquoise Parrot |work=The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000|last=Garnett, Stephen T.;  Crowley, Gabriel M. |date=14 June 2011|work=Threatened species & ecological communities|publisher=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=21 May 2013|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> Its population and range have varied wildly; widely distributed across eastern Australia from Mackay to Melbourne, it vanished from much of its range to the extent that it was presumed extinct in 1915. It was not recorded from Queensland between 1923 and 1950, and Victoria between the mid-1880s and 1949, but had repopulated East Gippsland by the 1960s. Numbers in New South Wales began increasing in the 1930s.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=576}}<!-- cites previous three sentences --> The population was tentatively estimated at 20,000 breeding birds in 2000, with around 90% residing in New South Wales, and is thought to be increasing.<ref name=GarnettCrowley/>

===New South Wales===
Once common across the Sydney region, and particularly abundant between the localities of [[Parramatta]] and [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]], the turquoise parrot dramatically declined in numbers over twenty years from 1875 to 1895. Rare sightings in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains were recorded in the mid-twentieth century.<ref name="Chaffer 1946"/> Almost all of its preferred habitat, the [[Cumberland Plain]], across western Sydney, had disappeared with development.

Turquoise parrots are encountered in pairs or small groups consisting of parents and several offspring. Outside the breeding season, birds may congregate into larger flocks of up to 50 to 75 birds. These are predominantly juveniles. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=577}} At night, turquoise parrots roost in the foliage of trees such as gums or [[Acacia|wattles]],{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=575}} anywhere from 1 to 8&nbsp;m (3<U+2013>25&nbsp;ft) above the ground. Birds roost together communally in autumn and winter.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=578}} During the day, they retreat to trees near their feeding areas.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=575}} The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call has been described as a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=579}}<!-- cites previous 2 sentences --> 

===Feeding===
The turquoise parrot is a predominantly ground-based seed eater,<ref name="BiB"/> foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest margins, and near trees in more open areas such as pastures. It occasionally feeds along road verges and rarely ventures onto lawns.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=574}} Birds forage in pairs or small troops of up to thirty or even fifty individuals. Observations at [[Chiltern, Victoria|Chiltern]] in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with turquoise parrots foraging in groups of 5<U+2013>30 in winter and 6<U+2013>8 in spring and summer. Foraging takes place from early in the morning till late afternoon, with a break between midday and mid-afternoon.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=576}} Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged in the grass.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=578}}

Grass and shrub seeds form the bulk of the diet, and leaves, flowers, fruit and scale insects are also eaten.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=576}} It has been recorded feeding on seeds of various plant species; more commonly consumed items include the  fruit of common fringe-myrtle (''[[Calytrix tetragona]]''), seeds and fruit of erect guinea-flower (''[[Hibbertia riparia]]''), daphne heath (''[[Brachyloma daphnoides]]''), seeds of common raspwort (''[[Gonocarpus tetragynus]]''), ''[[Geranium]]'' species, black-anther flax-lily (''[[Dianella revoluta]]'') and grass species such as the introduced big quaking grass (''[[Briza maxima]]'') and little quaking grass (''[[Briza minor|B. minor]]'') and members of the genus ''[[Danthonia]]'',{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=577}} members of the pea genus ''[[Dillwynia]]'', small-leaved beard-heath (''[[Leucopogon microphyllus]]''), as well as the introduced common chickweed (''[[Stellaria media]]'') and capeweed (''[[Arctotheca calendula]]'').<ref name="Tzaros2005">{{cite book|author=Tzaros, Chris|title=Wildlife of the Box-Ironbark Country|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DFhZQcFsQqkC&pg=PA95|accessdate=23 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09983-8|page=95}}</ref> Nectar of ''[[Grevillea alpina]]'',<ref name=higgins577>Higgins, p. 577.</ref> and spores from moss have been recorded as food items.<ref name="Chaffer 1946"/>

A female was observed placing leaves of the flaky-barked tea-tree (''[[Leptospermum trinervium]]'') underneath its feathers, leading the observers to wonder whether they were being used to deter or kill insects.<ref name="Chaffer 1946"/>

===Breeding===
[[Image:Turquoise Parrot-01.jpg|left|thumb|Female in captivity]]
The turquoise parrot is monogamous.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=577}} The male perches upright on a tree stump and extends its wings to show off its red and blue markings when courting a female.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=578}} Once paired, both sexes look for a nesting site, which is ultimately chosen by the female.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=578}} Breeding has been reported from [[Girraween National Park]] on the New South Wales-Queensland border in the north to Wangaratta and Mallacoota in Victoria.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=575}} Birds use vertical or nearly-vertical hollows of live and dead trees, generally eucalypts, as nesting sites. Occasionally old fence posts have been used. The turquoise parrot competes with<U+2014>and may be ousted by<U+2014>the [[eastern rosella]] (''Platycercus eximius''), [[red-rumped parrot]] (''Psephotus haematonotus'') and [[brown treecreeper]] (''Climacteris picumnus'') for suitable breeding sites. The tree containing the hollow is often located in open woodland, and the hollow itself is generally at least 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) above the ground. Fieldwork in northern Victoria yielded average dimensions of 10 by 6&nbsp;cm (4 by 3 in) for the hollow entrance, and a depth of around 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;in) for the depth of the hole. Elsewhere the average depth is around {{convert|76|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=580}}<!-- cites previous four sentences -->

Breeding takes place over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid on a bed to wood dust or leaves and consists of two to five (or rarely eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22&nbsp;mm long by 18&nbsp;mm wide. Clutches tended to be larger (have more eggs) in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days each.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=580}}<!-- cites previous four sentences --> The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=577}} She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=580}} Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=577}} Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The chicks are [[altricial]] and [[nidicolous]]; they are born blind and covered in silvery-white brown [[down feather|down]].{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=580}} They have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=582}} By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23 days of age in the wild and up to 30 days of age in captivity.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=580}}<!-- cites previous 2 sentences -->

Around 56% of eggs lead to successful fledging of young; fieldwork in northeastern Victoria yielding an average of 2.77 young leaving the nest. Nest predators include the [[lace monitor]] (''Varanus varius'') and [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''). Baby birds may perish in very hot weather or heavy rain by being drowned in the hollows.{{sfn|Higgins|1999|p=580}}<!-- cites previous three sentences -->

==Pathogens==
In 1966, a [[Paramyxoviridae|paramyxovirus]] with some [[antigen]]ic similarity to [[Newcastle disease]] was isolated from the brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot and members of the genus ''Neophema'' had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smit, T; Rondhuis, P.R. |year=1976 |title=Studies on a Virus Isolated from the Brain of a Parakeet (''Neophema'' sp) |journal=Avian Pathology |volume=5 |issue=1|pages=21<U+2013>30|doi=10.1080/03079457608418166|pmid=18777326 |first1=Th. |last2=Rondhuis |first2=P.R. }}</ref> Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to [[avian paramyxovirus]] infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jung, Arne; Grund, Christian; M<U+00FC>ller, Inge; Rautenschlein, Silke |year=2009 |title=Avian Paramyxovirus Serotype 3 Infection in ''Neopsephotus'', ''Cyanoramphus'', and ''Neophema'' species |journal=Journal of Avian Medicine and Surgery |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=205<U+2013>08|jstor=27753673 |doi=10.1647/2008-022.1}}</ref> it is one of many species of parrot that can host the [[nematode]] ''Ascaridia platyceri''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mawson|first=Patricia M.|year=1985|title=Nematodes (''Ascaridia'' Species) from Some Captive and Feral Parrots|journal=South Australian Ornithologist|volume=29|pages=190<U+2013>91|issn=0038-2973}}</ref>

==Aviculture==
Initially popular as a caged bird in the 19th century,{{sfn|Lendon|1973|p=285}} the turquoise parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being the high rate of infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity.{{sfn|Shephard|1989|p=69}} There is a possibility of interbreeding with other members of the genus ''Neophema'' if caged together.{{sfn|Shephard|1989|p=70}} Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots.{{sfn|Shephard|1989|p=70}} A yellow form, where the yellow and red pigments are conserved alone, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a [[Recessive trait|recessive]] mutation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviculturalsocietynsw.org/_articles/mutations-aust-parrots_091996.htm#.VAmfFsK1ab8  |title=Mutations of Australian Parrots|last=Sindel  |first=Stan|year=1986|publisher=The Avicultural Society of New South Wales|accessdate=5 September 2014|location=Panania, New South Wales }}</ref> Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive ([[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parrotsociety.org.au/articles/art_009.htm#Turquoise Parrot|title=Neophemas <U+2013> Care and Management|last=Anderson|first=Troy|year=1996|publisher=Parrot Society of Australia |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>
