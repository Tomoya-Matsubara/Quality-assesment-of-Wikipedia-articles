'''Route 147''' is a {{convert|4.20|mi|km|2|adj=on}} [[New Jersey State Route|state highway]] located in [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]] in [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. It is a short connector between [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]] in [[Middle Township, New Jersey|Middle Township]] and [[North Wildwood, New Jersey|North Wildwood]] at New York Avenue. West of U.S. Route 9, the road continues to [[New Jersey Route 47|Route 47]] as [[County Route 618 (Cape May County, New Jersey)|County Route 618]] (Indian Trail Road); this route along with Route 147 provides an alternate route to [[The Wildwoods]] from Route 47. East of New York Avenue, the route continues south through The Wildwoods as [[County Route 621 (Cape May County, New Jersey)|County Route 621]] (New Jersey Avenue). The route passes through mostly marshland along its journey, intersecting the [[Garden State Parkway]] at a partial interchange and County Route 619 ([[Ocean Drive (New Jersey)|Ocean Drive]]). The portion of the route east of the intersection with the latter forms a part of Ocean Drive. When the [[List of 500-series county routes in New Jersey|500-series county routes]] were established in New Jersey in the 1950s, what is now Route 147 became a part of [[County Route 585 (New Jersey)|County Route 585]], a route running from [[Lower Township, New Jersey|Lower Township]] north to [[Absecon, New Jersey|Absecon]]. Route 147 was designated along County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 and the North Wildwood border. The route was extended to its current location in North Wildwood by the 1990s.

Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 147 becomes a four-lane [[divided highway]] that briefly passes more homes and commercial establishments before entering a [[river delta|delta-type]] series of marshy rivers and inlets. It turns to the southeast and comes to an intersection with County Route 665 before crossing the [[Grassy Sound]] on a bridge.<ref name=sld/><ref name="google"/> After the bridge, the route comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of [[County Route 619 (Cape May County, New Jersey)|County Route 619]] ([[Ocean Drive (New Jersey)|Ocean Drive]]).<ref name=sld/>

At this point, the Ocean Drive moniker merges onto Route 147 and the road crosses over the Beach Creek into the beach resort of [[North Wildwood, New Jersey|North Wildwood]]. Here, the route turns south and becomes Spruce Avenue, which heads between marshland to the west and resort homes to the east. At the intersection with West Angelsea Drive, Route 147 becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues past more developments, turning to the southeast. Route 147 heads through a mix or residential and commercial establishments before ending at the intersection with New York Avenue.<ref name=sld/><ref name="google"/> From here, [[County Route 621 (Cape May County, New Jersey)|County Route 621]] continues south along the roadway as New Jersey Avenue.<ref name=sld/> Route 147, along with County Route 618, provide an alternate route to [[The Wildwoods]] from Route 47.<ref>[[:File:NJ 47 SB approaching Cape May CR 618.JPG|Signage for CR 618/NJ 147 alternate route to Wildwoods on NJ 47 southbound]].
