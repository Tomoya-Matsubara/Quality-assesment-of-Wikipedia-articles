Cephalic Carnage is also known for its humorous songs. [[Popmatters]] points out some examples: "On past albums, the band has taken satirical swipes at the overtly image-oriented [[black metal]] ("Black Metal Sabbath") and the oversaturated, angst-ridden [[metalcore]] sound ("Dying Will Be the Death of Me"), and even in live settings, they<U+2019>re not above taking the odd spontaneous piss-take to bring some levity to a situation. One notorious  YouTube clip has a fight starting in the pit at a Cephalic show in Toronto, and in an inspired moment, the band launches into a rousing excerpt from "[[Eye of the Tiger]]", to a raucous ovation from the kids."<ref name="PopMatters Xenosaphien"/>
