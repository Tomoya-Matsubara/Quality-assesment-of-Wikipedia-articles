Sports|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> (born October 8, 1979), better known by his ring name '''Paul Burchill''', is an [[England|English]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He is best known for his time with [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), where he signed after training and debuting for the [[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]] in his home country.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Frontier Wrestling Alliance (2002<U+2013>2004)===
Birchall is a former [[primary school]] [[teacher]] from [[Surrey]], but got into professional wrestling in 2001 after walking into the [[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]'s (FWA) Academy and quickly impressing the man running the camp, [[Mark Sloan (wrestler)|Mark Sloan]].<ref name="owow">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/p/paul-burchill.html|title=Paul Burchill Profile|accessdate=2008-04-27|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="slam"/>

While training at the Academy under Sloan's guidance, Birchall made his debut in August 2002 using the slightly modified spelling of his name Paul Burchill.<ref name="slam"/> In mid-2002, Burchill began to appear in the FWA by interfering in matches or before them, making unscheduled appearances and beating other wrestlers leading to October at Uprising when he took out both members of The New Breed (Ashe and Curve) singlehandedly before their match.<ref name="fwa50">{{cite web|url=http://www.fwauk.com/index.php?page=history_gm|title=The FWA's Fifty Golden Moments|publisher=[[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> He went on interfering in matches, even taking out all four competitors in a four-way match<ref name="slam"/> until May when he made his first scheduled appearance at Frontiers of Honour, jointly held between FWA and [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH). Debuting with manager 'Twisted Genius' [[Dean Ayass]] he defeated the tag team of Double Dragon (Raj Jordon and Ross Jordan), in his first sanctioned match<ref name="roh">{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/live/events/past-event|title=Past Events|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref> by double knockout.<ref name="fwa5">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/FrontierWrestlingTV#play/user/1CE77F313BF71BD2/3/uXte0LlrB9k|title=FWA Top 20 Moments: 5-2|date=2009-07-30|work=[[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> Burchill went on an undefeated streak in handicap matches against tag teams for the rest of the year, often running into the Duke of Danger (who he'd taken out in the four way) and [[Andrew Simmons|Andy Simmons]], part of the [[wikt:aristocrat|aristocrat]] themed group Hampton Court.<ref name="fwa03">{{cite web|url=http://www.fwauk.com/index.php?page=results&res=2003|title=FWA results 2003|publisher=[[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> He cemented this winning streak in a moment voted thirteenth on the FWA's Top 20 Moments when he interrupted the Duke's thrashing of peasants ([[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S|squashing]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#J|jobbers]]) at Hotwired in September<ref name="fwa50"/> and performed a double [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman.27s carry slam|rolling fireman's carry slam]] before debuting his [[Powerslam#Standing moonsault side slam|C-4]] finishing move.<ref name="fwa15">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/FrontierWrestlingTV#play/user/1CE77F313BF71BD2/1/pfG1hXOcXu4|title=FWA's Top 20 Moments: 15-11|date=2009-07-24|work=[[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> By the end of 2003 he was voted Rookie of the Year by both Total Wrestling and 1 Stop Wrestling.<ref name="slam"/>

His winning streak would go untarnished until mid-2004 at June's Carpe Diem event where Simmons continued to resist being pinned or submitting to Burchill. Frustrated, Burchill went up the ramp to talk to his manager Ayass but while there veteran [[Drew McDonald]] came from the back and hit him with a steel chair<ref name="fwa10">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/user/FrontierWrestlingTV#play/user/1CE77F313BF71BD2/2/zG7E2u1ILjo|title=FWA Top 20 Moments: 10-6|date=2009-07-29|work=[[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> causing Burchill to lose via count out.<ref name="fwa04">{{cite web|url=http://www.fwauk.com/index.php?page=results&res=2004|title=FWA results 2004|publisher=[[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> Burchill gained some level of revenge when he teamed up with [[Terry Funk]] and Paul Travell to take on McDonald, Thunder and his first victim Ghosh at November's British Uprising III, receiving a standing ovation from the 1,800 fans in attendance as news broke that he had signed with American promotion [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE).<ref name="slam"/> A fortnight later at FWA's annual Gold Rush event he faced [[British Heavyweight Championship (XWA)|FWA British Heavyweight Champion]] [[Alex Shane]] in a non-title match, being pinned for the first time since training in the Academy in his last match.<ref name="fwa04"/>

===Other promotions (2004)===
On August 1, 2004, Burchill defeated [[Doug Williams (wrestler)|Doug Williams]] and [[The Zebra Kid]] ([[Roy Bevis]]) in a No Holds Barred three way match to become the International Wrestling Promotions (IWP) Heavyweight Champion. He would hold the title until November 6, when he lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]] to [[D'Lo Brown]].<ref name="owow"/>

In May 2004, Burchill made two appearances in Athletik Club Wrestling (ACW) in Germany losing in a tag team match to [[Jerry Lynn]] and Michael Kovac. Later that night he took part in a 22-man battle royal losing to fellow Brit Doug Williams.<ref name="acw1">{{cite web|url=http://www.acw-pro.de/ergebnisse/acwewc-back-splash-iv|title=ACW/EWC Back Splash IV|publisher=Athletik Club Wrestling|language=German|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> He returned in July for Summer Heat where he took on Patrick Shulz, who he had tagged with at the previous event, and won in a grudge match.

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005<U+2013>2008)====
Burchill briefly appeared in [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) in 2005 before his appearance on SmackDown, making it to the second round of a tournament for the [[OVW Television Championship]]. He also feuded briefly with [[Dolph Ziggler|Nick Nemeth]], exchanging victories before winning an [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] shot along with [[Steven Adkins|Seth Skyfire]] in a battle royal but the hastily assembled pair could not defeat [[Blond Bombers#Tank Toland and Chad Toland|The Blond Bombers]] (Tank and Chad Toland) in the next match.<ref name="ovw05">{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/_2005/|title=OVW results 2005|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>

In January 2006 he began a feud with [[Kenny Dykstra|Ken Doane]] after Doane abandoned Burchill during a tag team match. The following week Burchill defeated Doane despite the presence of the rest of the [[Spirit Squad]] at ringside. He also had a brief angle where he interrupted a match to attack [[Shelly Martinez]] but instead carried her backstage and she was later seen wearing a pirate's wench outfit and chasing him to no avail. She would later attack [[Kara Drew|Cherry Pie]] during his win over [[Jimmy Reiher, Jr.|Deuce Shade]]. In September he won a battle royal for a shot at the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]] but lost the match later that night. He earned another shot at the championship in December by defeating [[Steven Adkins|Seth Skyfire]] in a Christmas Presents match. A week later Chett the Jet beat Jacob Duncan for the championship at which point Burchill came to the ring and hit Chett with a steel chair, telling [[Daniel Hollie|Danny Basham]], the [[Professional wrestling authority figures|Troubleshooter]], that he was the primary contender for the belt and demanded a match instantly thus ending 2006 with his first OVW Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="ovw06">{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/_2006/|title=OVW results 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref><ref name="OVW-heavyweight"/>

He defended the belt frequently against both Chett and Duncan in 2007 and earned the nickname "Ripper" by repeatedly defeating them both<ref name="ovw07">{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/_2007/|title=OVW results 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> but lost it on February 17 in his second defence against [[Cody Rhodes|Cody Runnels]].<ref name="ovwtitle">{{cite web|url=http://ovwrestling.com/titles.html|title=OVW Championship history|publisher=[[Ohio Valley Wrestling]]|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> He won it back the next day from Rhodes.<ref name="OVW-heavyweight"/> After more successful defences [[Damien Sandow|Aaron "The Idol" Stevens]] won the belt from him on March 14.<ref name="ovwtitle"/> A rematch on April 18 ended in a  double count-out but Burchill would not be appeased, interfering in Runnels' title shot to make the match a no contest and on May 9 he was given another shot at the title and won it for a third time.<ref name="OVW-heavyweight"/> Two weeks later on May 23, a rematch between Burchill and Stevens went to a draw when both men simultaneously pinned each other leading the title to be held up and vacated.<ref name="ovwtitle"/> A match for the vacant title was booked between Burchill, Stevens and [[Brad Bradley|Jay Bradley]] on June 1 with Bradley picking up the win.<ref name="OVW-heavyweight"/> Burchill regained the belt later that month on June 27 but lost it July 28 to [[Vladimir Kozlov (wrestler)|Vladimir Kozlov]].<ref name="ovwtitle"/>

In August, Burchill pinned [[Mark Henry]] in retaliation for Henry injuring him on SmackDown months prior. In November he defeated [[Wade Barrett|Stu Sanders]] by the referee's ten count but teamed with him the following week, eventually getting to the finals of a tournament for the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship but losing the last match to [[Ronnie Arneill|Shawn Spears]] and [[Colt Cabana]].<ref name="ovw07"/> In the first show of 2008 the team beat Cabana and Charles Evans to capture the titles.<ref name="ovwtitle"/> Around the same time he also began sending presents to [[Katarina Waters|Katie "The Kat" Lea]] as a secret admirer, eventually revealing himself when he helped her win her second [[OVW Women's Championship]].<ref name="ovw08">{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/_2008/|title=OVW results 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> His final appearance in OVW, on February 27, was in a four corners tag team match where he and Sanders lost their championship to [[Los Locos]] (Ram<U+00F3>n and Ra<U+00FA>l).<ref name="ovwtitle"/>

====Debut (2005<U+2013>2006)====
After arriving in the US, Burchill was scouted by [[Tommy Dreamer]] and called up to the main roster by August.<ref name="dream">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/article42849.ece|title='I'm still living the dream'|last=[[The LilsBoys]]|date=2006-03-29|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> He made his WWE debut on the August 27, 2005 episode of ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'', when he made a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#R|run-in]] in a match between fellow Englishman [[William Regal]] and [[Scott Garland (wrestler)|Scotty 2 Hotty]]. Burchill quickly established an alliance with his countryman, helping Regal to beat down Scotty 2 Hotty.<ref name="slam"/> A week later he debuted on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', teaming with Regal to defeat Hotty and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]] via submission when Scotty [[Professional wrestling#Submission|tapped out]] to Burchill's [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Royal Mutilation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09012005/|title=Another Assist From Dad|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2007-12-31|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> The next week on ''SmackDown!'', Burchill defeated Scotty 2 Hotty in a singles match in the same manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09092005/|title=Changing Friday nights|date=2005-09-09|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> After rising through the tag team ranks Regal and Burchill were given a chance at the [[WWE Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Championship]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Fatal Four Way match]] facing [[The Mexicools]], [[MNM (wrestling)|MNM]] and then-champions [[Road Warriors#L.O.D. 2005|Legion of Doom]] ([[Road Warrior Animal]] and [[Jon Heidenreich|Heidenreich]]), but lost out to MNM.<ref name="SD-05/10/28">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10282005/|title=LIGHTS OUT|date=2005-10-28|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Regal and Burchill continued tagging together, mainly feuding with The Mexicools on ''Velocity'' while Regal often acted as a manager for Burchill during his singles matches.

On the February 3, 2006 edition of ''SmackDown!'', Burchill and Regal told ''SmackDown!'' "network representative" [[Brian Mailhot|Palmer Canon]] that they no longer wanted to be a tag team so they could go their separate ways. During this discussion, Burchill informed Canon that his family heritage traces back to the [[Piracy|pirate]] [[Blackbeard]] and he wanted to do a pirate [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] on ''SmackDown!''.<ref name="pirate">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/02032006/|title=Who's going to WrestleMania?|date=2006-02-03|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> He followed through on this promise the following week when he appeared backstage dressed as a pirate, with a look similar to that of [[Johnny Depp]]'s character from the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/02102006/|title=Deadman's Return|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Regal tried to convince Burchill to return to his former ruthless gimmick, while Burchill refused cementing him as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/02242006/|title=Back in business|date=2006-02-24|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Burchill had his first match as a pirate on the March 10, 2006 edition of ''SmackDown!'', making an elaborate entrance by swinging  down to the floor on a rope. Burchill defeated Regal using the C-4, which was renamed Walking the Plank to suit the gimmick.<ref name="piratefirstmatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/03102006/|title=The Deadman responds|date=2006-03-10|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> After Regal continued to persuade Burchill to return to his former gimmick, the two were booked in a match where the loser would be forced to wear the winner's choice of clothing. Burchill won the match, forcing Regal to dress at his whim until Burchill lost another match, initially dressing him up as a buxom wench,<ref name="SD-2006/04/07">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/04072006/|title=Breaking New Ground|date=2006-04-07|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> and later in various costumes such as a chicken suit and a gorilla suit. Eventually, he made Regal dress up like a [[buccaneer]] in order to tag with him against [[Shane Twins|Gymini]] on April 21. Burchill ended up abandoning Regal during the match, which led to Gymini picking up the victory.<ref name="SD-2006/04/21">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/04212006/|title=Something to Celebrate|date=2006-04-21|accessdate=2008-08-08|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> In early June, Burchill's popular pirate gimmick came to an end when [[Mark Henry]], who was going on a storyline rampage, defeated Burchill and then assaulted him afterwards resulting in him being stretchered off SmackDown.<ref name="sd0206">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/06022006/|title=All hail the king|last=Hoffman|first=Brett|date=2006-06-02|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> He resurfaced on SmackDown in July 2007 as a pirate for a [[Mardi Gras]] party thrown by [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], though he was not acknowledged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingtalk.net/?p=1902|title=Paul Burchill Returning|accessdate=2008-02-24|publisher=Wrestlingtalk.net}}</ref>

This time away from the ring was also used to develop a new gimmick to replace his pirate character on his return. This was done allegedly because [[Vince McMahon]], who reportedly was not aware of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' films and [[Johnny Depp]]'s pirate character, believed the character should have thought he was a real pirate, acting more like the [[Carl Ouellet]] pirate character from the 1990s, and felt it could not work as a crowd favorite, despite the positive crowd reactions Burchill received.
