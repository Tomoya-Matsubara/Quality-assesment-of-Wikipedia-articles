{{censorship}}
On 5 December 2008, the '''[[Internet Watch Foundation]]''' (IWF), a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[watchdog group]], '''[[Blacklist (computing)|blacklisted]] content on the [[English Wikipedia|English version]] of the online encyclopaedia [[Wikipedia]]''' related to the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions']] 1976 studio album ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', due to the presence of its controversial [[cover art]]work, depicting a young girl posing nude, with a faux glass shatter obscuring her [[genitalia]]. The image was deemed to be "potentially illegal content" under [[Protection of Children Act 1978|British law]] which forbids the possession or creation of indecent photographs of children. The IWF's blacklist are used in [[web filtering]] systems such as [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]], implementation of these systems by British [[internet service provider]]s are required by law.

The URL to its ''[[Help:Image page|image page]]'', which depicts the cover art, was also blacklisted; however thumbnails and the image itself remained accessible.

== Background ==
{{further|[[Virgin Killer#Cover art]]}}
The album art of the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions']] album ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' was deemed controversial at the time of its release,<ref name="Buck"/> featuring a young girl fully nude with a "smashed glass" effect covering her genitalia.<ref name="guardian1"/> The cover was replaced in some markets with an alternate cover image featuring a photo of the band members.

In the United Kingdom, access to illegal content (such as [[child pornography]]) was strictly self-regulated by individual [[internet service provider]]s. This began when [[BT Group]] introduced [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]], a server-side [[Content-control software|filtering system]] which uses data obtained from the [[Internet Watch Foundation]]. The IWF is a [[non-profit]] organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content to be added to their blacklists.<ref name="cleanfeedbegin">{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1232422,00.html|title=BT puts block on child porn sites|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=10 December 2008}}</ref> This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the [[Protection of Children Act 1978|Protection of Children Act]].<ref>Internet Watch Foundation&nbsp;<U+2014> R v Bowden http://www.iwf.org.uk/police/page.99.209.htm</ref> British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.<ref name="LINX">"[http://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=497 Government sets deadline for universal network-level content blocking]", LINX, 29 May 2006.

== Addition to IWF blacklist ==
[[Image:Virgin Killer.jpg|thumb|The cover of the album ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', the image which instigated the controversy.]]
On 5 December 2008 the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] added the [[Wikipedia]] [[URL]]s for the ''Virgin Killer'' article and the [[:Image:Virgin Killer.jpg|description page of the image]] to its blacklist.<ref name="gamazon">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/08/amazon-internet-censorship-iwf|title=Internet watchdog considers censoring Amazon US over Scorpions image|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=8 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref> After the blacklisting, users of major UK [[Internet service provider|ISPs]], including [[BT Group|BT]], [[Vodafone]], [[Virgin Media]]/[[Tesco|Tesco.net]], [[Be Unlimited|Be]]/[[Telef<U+00F3>nica Europe|O2]], [[UK Online|EasyNet/UK Online]]/[[Sky Broadband]], [[Orange United Kingdom|Orange]], [[Demon Internet|Demon]], and [[TalkTalk (telecommunications company)|TalkTalk]] (Opal Telecom), were unable to access the content.<ref name=WP/>

Sarah Robertson, director of communications for the IWF, said that the image was rated "1 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least offensive". She described the picture as "erotic posing with no sexual activity".<ref name="gamazon"/>  While the image itself has not been flagged as "illegal", IWF determined it to be a "potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18."<ref name="WDP">{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155156/wikipedia_censorship_sparks_free_speech_debate.html|title=Wikipedia Censorship Sparks Free Speech Debate|last=Raphael|first=JR|date=8 December 2008|work=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[PC World]]|accessdate=17 December 2008}}</ref>

The IWF said they were first notified of the Wikipedia URL on Thursday, 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by US-based social conservative site ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].  An officer of the [[Concerned Women for America]], a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and pedophilia."<ref name="WDP"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/?pageId=63722|title=FBI investigates 'Wikipedophilia'|publisher=''[[WorldNetDaily]]''|date=7 May 2008|first=Chelsea|last=Schilling|accessdate=9 December 2008}}
</ref> ''EContent'' magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the ''Virgin Killer'' cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors "favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Wikipedia-Weighs-Information-Against-Indecency-49659.htm|title=Wikipedia Weighs Information Against Indecency|first=Jessica|last=Dye|date=1 July 2008|publisher=''EContent''|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref> However, according to ''[[The Guardian]]'' because "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on." Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win," before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly "given that you can go into [[HMV Group|HMV]] and buy a copy on the high street".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/dec/09/wikipedia-censorship|title=Wikipedia censor mess 'a no-win'|last=Johnson|first=Bobbie|date=9 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref>  On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages on the basis of the "contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability".<ref name="IWF9"/>

== Effects on Wikipedia ==
{{See also|Cleanfeed (content blocking system)}}
{{See also|Proxy server}}
[[File:VK WikipediaBlock.png|thumb|left|Users attempting to access the ''Virgin Killer'' article or image were met with pseudo-[[404 error]]s or other messages.]]
The blacklisting of ''Virgin Killer'' also caused other inadvertent issues for Wikipedia users in the United Kingdom. Usually most Internet users have a unique [[IP address]] visible to websites. However, as a result of ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]] technology, traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of [[proxy server]]s.<ref name="pcworld">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155112/wikipedia_article_censored_in_uk_for_the_first_time.html|title=Wikipedia Article Censored in UK for the First Time|last=Kirk|first=Jeremy|date=8 December 2008|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref> This caused problems for users of the site. Since Wikipedia allows users to anonymously edit its encyclopedia articles, these individuals are identified only through their IP addresses, which are used to selectively block users who vandalize the site or otherwise break its rules. The proxy filtering makes it impossible to uniquely distinguish users, and to prevent vandalism Wikipedia "instituted a blanket ban on anonymous edits from the six ISPs, which account for 95% of British residential internet users".<ref name="smh">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/web/wikipedia-added-to-child-pornography-blacklist/2008/12/08/1228584723764.html|title=Wikipedia added to child pornography blacklist|last=Moses|first=Asher|date=8 December 2008|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref> This had the immediate effect of requiring nearly all registered users in the UK to request the lifting of <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Autoblock IP Autoblocks]</span> on their accounts before they could edit again, and the de-facto permanent effect of barring any contribution from people without <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F user accounts on the site]</span> (who contribute merely under an IP address and not a user name).

The [[MediaWiki]] software that Wikipedia runs on can interpret [[X-Forwarded-For]] (XFF) headers, allowing Wikipedia to identify a user's main IP address rather than the proxy IP address, allowing the ability to block proxy users individually by their client's IP rather than the proxy server IP (avoiding the need to block the whole proxy due to the actions of a single user)<ref name="pcworld"/>. However, none of the ISPs subscribing to this system pass X-Forwarded-For information to Wikipedia, having the impact of reversing the normal method of identification and blocking on Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155112/wikipedia_article_censored_in_uk_for_the_first_time.html|title=Wikipedia Article Censored in UK for the First Time|last=Kirk|first=Jeremy|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|publisher=IDG News Service|accessdate=10 December 2008}}</ref>  IP addresses assumed to be assigned to an individual person or organisation were assigned instead to millions of people and thousands of registered editors.<ref name="ORG">{{cite web|url=http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2008/12/08/iwf-censors-wikipedia-chaos-ensues/|title=IWF censors Wikipedia, chaos ensues|last=Hogge|first=Becky|publisher=[[Open Rights Group]]|accessdate=10 December 2008}}</ref> Wikipedia servers saw them all as the IP of the proxy rather than each as the IP of their own machine.

Due to erroneous use of [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]] and other routing technology to redirect the connections to the filtering proxies, users of some networks were temporarily prevented from accessing or editing any content hosted by Wikimedia, a problem reminiscent of [[Blocking of YouTube#Pakistan|Pakistan's accidental blocking]] of [[YouTube]] for much of the world instead of only their own citizens.

== Response by the Wikimedia Foundation ==

On 7 December, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], a non-profit organisation which supports the English Wikipedia, issued a press release about the blacklisting of their sites by the IWF stating that they had "no reason to believe the article, or the image contained in the article, has been held to be illegal in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world", and noting that not just the image but the article itself had been blocked.<ref name="wikimediapr">{{cite web|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Censorship_of_WP_in_the_UK_Dec_2008|title=Censorship of WP in the UK Dec 2008|publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|location=[[San Francisco]], [[California]]|date=7 December 2008|last=''Press release''|accessdate=8 December 2008}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
This incident has also had an effect on Australian Internet censoring plans. [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]] vice-chairman Colin Jacobs said that "[the] incident in Britain, in which virtually the entire country was unable to edit Wikipedia because the country's Internet Watch Foundation had blacklisted a single image on the site, illustrated the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/home/technology/labor-plan-to-censor-internet-in-shreds/2008/12/09/1228584820006.html?page=2|title=Labor plan to censor internet in shreds|last=Moses|first=Asher|date=9 December 2008|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="stuff">{{cite web| url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4788463a28.html| title = Aussie plan to censor Web in shreds|accessdate =10 December 2008|date=10 December 2008|last = Moses|first = Asher| publisher = stuff.co.nz}}</ref> ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' has commented that "Ironically, the banning of the image has only made it visible to more people as news sites publicise the issue and the image spreads across sites other than Wikipedia."<ref name="smh"/> This is known as the [[Streisand effect]]. At the time of the incident [[Amazon.com|Amazon US]] were also displaying the image on their site and the IWF stated that it "might yet add Amazon US to its list of 'blocked' sites for hosting the picture";<ref name="gamazon"/> however, Amazon subsequently took the decision to remove the image from their site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/09/wikipedia-censorship-iwf-reconsiders|title=Internet Watch Foundation reconsiders Wikipedia censorship|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=9 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=10 December 2008}}: "However Amazon US no longer risks being blocked under IWF's rulings. The image, as an album cover, had been on its site earlier this week, but has now been removed, apparently on the site's own initiative."</ref>

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] criticised the IWF's reasoning:<ref>[http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/12/internet-censors-must-be-accountable-things-they-b Internet Censors Must Be Accountable For The Things They Break,], Peter Eckersley, 2008-12-09</ref>
