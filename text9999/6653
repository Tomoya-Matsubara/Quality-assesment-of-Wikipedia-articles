The  '''1932 Washington Bicentennial''' are [[postage stamps]] issued by the [[United States government]] in 1932 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]]'s birth. Twelve stamps were issued as a collection, with each one depicting the President in a different period in his life.

The series was designed by [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] (BEP) designers Clair Aubrey Huston and Alvin Meissner.  The 1/2<U+00A2> through 10<U+00A2> values present portraits of Washington derived from paintings, engravings or sculptures made during his lifetime.

The selections were made based on recommendations made by the Washington Bicentennial Commission, The United States Post Office Department and the BEP.  The original concept called for not only picturing Washington but also featuring significant events, locations and iconic images of his life and after death.  This was later modified to featuring only portraits.<ref name="Scotts">{{cite book |title='''Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers''' |year=2010 |publisher=Scott Publishing Company |ISBN=978-0-89487-446-8 <!--|ISBN=0-89487-446-2isbn=0-89487-0424--> |first=James E. |last=Kloetzel |coauthors=Jones, William A. }}</ref><ref name="Smithsonian">[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=5&cmd=2&q=1932+bicentennial&f=1&f=2&d_start=&d_end=&c=&lf=3  '''''Smithsonian National Postal Museum''''']</ref>

The bicentennial stamps were first placed on sale January 1, 1932, at the post office in Washington, D.C.

[[File:720.jpg|left|thumb|70px]]
While the bicentennial issue presents many unfamiliar images of Washington, the Post Office took care to place the widely loved Gilbert Stuart portrait of the president on the 2-cent stamp, which satisfied the normal first-class letter rate and would therefore get the most use. Several months after the series appeared, however, the first-class letter rate was raised from 2 cents to 3 cents.  Because the 3-cent bicentennial issue presents an image of Washington that is not only little-known but quite uncharacteristic, the Post Office chose not to encourage its wide use, and, instead, revamped the 2-cent Atheneum portrait issue as a 3-cent stamp (Scott #720), printing it in the standard 3-cent color.{{cn}}
