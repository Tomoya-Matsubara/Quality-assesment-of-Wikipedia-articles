'''Henry VI''' (6 December 1421 &ndash; 21 May 1471) was [[Kingdom of England|King of England]] from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471, and  disputed [[King of France]] from 1422 to 1453. Until 1437, his realm was governed by [[regent]]s. Contemporaneous accounts described him as peaceful and pious, not suited for the harsh [[Wars of the Roses|struggles]] to come.  His periods of insanity and his inherent benevolence eventually required his quarrelsome Queen consort, [[Margaret of Anjou]], to assume control of his kingdom, which contributed to his own downfall, the collapse of the [[House of Lancaster]], and the rise of the [[House of York]].<ref>The standard modern biography is Bertram Wolff, ''Henry VI'', London, 1981.</ref>

==Child King==
{{Main|The Dual-Monarchy of England and France}}

Henry was the only child and heir of King [[Henry V of England]]. He was born on 6 December 1421 at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]], and succeeded to the throne at the age of nine months as [[King of England]] on 31 August 1422, when his father died, and King of France on 21 October 1422 upon his grandfather [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]'s death in agreement with the [[Treaty of Troyes]] in 1420.  His mother, [[Catherine of Valois]], was then 20 years old and, as Charles VI's daughter, was viewed with considerable suspicion by English nobles and prevented from having a full role in her son's upbringing.

On 28 September 1423, the nobles swore loyalty to Henry VI. They summoned [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in the King's name and established a [[Regency Government of England 1422-1437|regency council]] until the King should come of age. One of Henry V's surviving brothers, [[John, Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster/Plantagenet, Duke of Bedford]], was appointed senior regent of the realm and was in charge of the ongoing war in France, where the [[Battle of Cravant]] had recently occurred in the current phase of the [[Hundred Years War]]. During Bedford's absence, the government of England was headed by Henry V's other surviving brother, [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], who was appointed Protector and Defender of the Realm.  His duties were limited to keeping the peace and summoning Parliament.  Bishop [[Henry Beaufort]] (Cardinal after 1426),  Henry V's half-uncle, had an important place on the Council.  After the Duke of Bedford died in 1435, the Duke of Gloucester claimed the Regency himself, but was contested in this by the other members of the council.

From 1428, Henry's tutor was [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick]], whose father had been instrumental in [[Lords Appellant|the opposition to Richard II's reign]].

Henry's half-brothers, [[Edmund Tudor|Edmund]] and [[Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford|Jasper]], the sons of his widowed mother's relationship with [[Owen Tudor]], were later given earldoms.  Edmund Tudor was the father of Henry Tudor, later to gain the throne as [[Henry VII of England]].

In reaction to Charles VII Valois's coronation as French King in [[Reims cathedral]] on 17 July 1429,<ref>Lingard, John, ''A History of England'', Vol. V, 1854, pg. 90<!--a better source could be found--></ref> Henry was soon crowned King of England at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 6 November 1429,<ref>Lingard, pg. 90</ref> followed by his own coronation as King of France at [[Notre Dame de Paris]] on 16 December 1431,<ref>Lingard, pg. 91</ref> although it wasn't until a month before his sixteenth birthday on 13 November 1437 that he obtained some measure of independent authority,<ref>Lingard, pg. 107</ref> before he finally assumed full royal powers when he came of age.<ref>Lingard, pg. 108</ref>

==Assumption of government and French policies==
Henry was declared of age in 1437, the year in which his mother died, and assumed the reins of government. Henry, shy and pious, averse to deceit and bloodshed, immediately allowed his court to be dominated by a few noble favourites who clashed on the matter of the French war.

After the death of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], England had lost momentum in the [[Hundred Years' War]], while, beginning with [[Joan of Arc]]'s military victories, the [[House of Valois|Valois]] gained ground. The young king came to favour a policy of peace in France, and thus favoured the faction around [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]] and [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk]], who thought likewise, while [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] and [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], who argued for a continuation of the war, were ignored.
[[File:Henry VI accession.jpg|thumb|left|Henry VI, aged nine months, is shown being placed in the care of the [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]]]]

==Marriage to Margaret of Anjou==
Cardinal Beaufort and the Earl of Suffolk persuaded the king that the best way of pursuing peace with France was through a marriage with [[Margaret of Anjou]], the niece of [[Charles VII of France|the Valois King Charles VII]]'s wife. Henry agreed, especially when he heard reports of Margaret's stunning beauty, and sent Suffolk to negotiate with Charles, who agreed to the marriage on condition that he would not have to provide the customary [[dowry]] and instead would receive the lands of [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] and [[Anjou]] from the English. These conditions were agreed to in the [[Treaty of Tours]], but the cession of Maine and Anjou was kept secret from parliament. It was known that this would be hugely unpopular with the English populace. The marriage went ahead in 1445.

[[Image:MargaretAnjou.jpg|thumb|Margaret of Anjou]]
Henry had wavered in yielding Maine and Anjou to Charles, knowing that the move was unpopular and would be opposed by the Dukes of Gloucester and York. However, Margaret was determined to make him see it through. As the treaty became public knowledge in 1446, public anger focused on [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Suffolk]], but Henry and Margaret were determined to protect him.

==The ascendancy of Suffolk and Somerset==
In 1447, the King and Queen summoned the Duke of Gloucester before parliament on the charge of treason. This move was instigated by Gloucester's enemies, the Earl of Suffolk, the ageing Cardinal Beaufort and his nephew, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Earl of Somerset]]. Gloucester was put in custody in [[Bury St Edmunds]], where he died, probably of a [[heart attack]], although there were contemporaneous rumours of poisoning, before he could be tried.

[[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York|The Duke of York]], now Henry's heir presumptive, was excluded from the court circle and sent to govern [[Ireland]], while his opponents, the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset were promoted to Dukes, a title at that time still normally reserved for immediate relatives of the monarch. The new Duke of Somerset was sent to France to lead the war.

In the later years of Henry's reign, the monarchy became increasingly unpopular, due to a breakdown in law and order, corruption, the distribution of royal land to the king's court favourites, the troubled state of the crown's finances, and the steady loss of territories in France. In 1447, this unpopularity took the form of a Commons campaign against the Duke of Suffolk, who was the most unpopular of all the King's entourage and widely seen as a traitor. Henry was forced to send him into [[exile]], but Suffolk's ship was intercepted in the [[English Channel]]. His murdered body was found on the beach at [[Dover]].{{House of Lancaster|henry6}}

In 1449, the Duke of Somerset, leading the campaign in France, reopened hostilities in [[Normandy]], but by the autumn had been pushed back to [[Caen]]. By 1450, the French had retaken the whole province, so hard won by Henry V. Returning troops, who had often not been paid, added to the sense of lawlessness in the southern counties of England, and [[Jack Cade]] led a rebellion in [[Kent]] in 1450, calling himself "John Mortimer", apparently in sympathy with York, and setting up residence at the [[White Hart]] Inn in Southwark (the [[stag|white hart]] had been the symbol of the deposed [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]). Henry came to London with an army to crush the rebellion, but on finding that Cade had fled kept most of his troops behind while a small force followed the rebels and met them at [[Sevenoaks]]. The flight proved to have been tactical: Cade successfully ambushed the force in the Battle of Solefields and returned to occupy London. In the end, the rebellion achieved nothing, and London was retaken after a few days of disorder; but this was principally because of the efforts of its own residents rather than the army.  At any rate the rebellion showed that feelings of discontent were running high.<ref>Sevenoaks Preservation Society: ''The Rising in Kent in 1450 A.D.'', J.K.D.  Copy in Sevenoaks public library.</ref>

In 1451, the Duchy of [[Guyenne]], held since [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s time, was also lost. In October 1452, an English advance in Guyenne retook [[Bordeaux]] and was having some success but by 1453, Bordeaux was lost again, leaving [[Calais]] as England's only remaining territory on the continent.

==Insanity and the ascendancy of York==
In 1452, [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York|the Duke of York]] was persuaded to return from Ireland, claim his rightful place on the council and put an end to bad government. His cause was a popular one, and he soon raised an army at [[Shrewsbury]]. The court party, meanwhile, raised their own similar-sized force in London. A stand-off took place south of London, with York presenting a list of grievances and demands to the court circle, including the arrest of Edmund Beaufort (the Duke of Somerset). The king initially agreed, but Margaret intervened to prevent the arrest of Beaufort. By 1453, his influence had been restored, and York was again isolated. The court party was also strengthened by the announcement that the Queen was pregnant.

However, on hearing of the final loss of Bordeaux in August 1453, Henry slipped into a [[mental breakdown]] and became completely unaware of everything that was going on around him. This was to last for more than a year, and Henry failed even to respond to the birth of his own son and heir, who was christened [[Edward of Westminster|Edward]]. Henry possibly inherited his illness from [[Charles VI of France]], his maternal grandfather, who coped with intermittent periods of insanity over the last thirty years of his life.<ref>Charles VI, in turn, could have inherited the hereditary trait from his mother [[Joanna of Bourbon]], who showed signs of [[mental illness]], and her Bourbon family, where her grandfather [[Louis I, Duke of Bourbon]], her father [[Peter I, Duke of Bourbon]] and her brother [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon]] each had symptoms of the ailment.</ref>

The Duke of York, meanwhile, had gained a very important ally, [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], one of the most influential magnates and possibly richer than York himself. York was named regent as Protector of the Realm in 1454. The queen was excluded completely, and Edmund Beaufort was detained in the [[Tower of London]], while many of York's supporters spread rumours that the king's child was not his, but Beaufort's. Other than that, York's months as regent were spent tackling the problem of government overspending.

==Wars of the Roses==
{{Main|War of the Roses}}

On Christmas Day 1454, King Henry regained his senses. Disaffected nobles who had grown in power during Henry's reign (most importantly the Earls of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]]) took matters into their own hands by backing the claims of the rival [[House of York]], first to the Regency, and then to the throne itself.

After a violent struggle between the houses of [[house of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[house of York|York]], Henry was deposed and imprisoned on 4 March 1461 by his cousin, [[Edward IV of England|Edward of York]], who became king, as Edward IV. By this point, Henry was suffering such a bout of madness that he was apparently laughing and singing while the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] raged, which secured his release. But Edward was still able to take the throne, though he failed to capture Henry and his queen, who fled to [[Scotland]]. During the first period of Edward IV's reign, Lancastrian resistance continued mainly under the leadership of Queen Margaret and the few nobles still loyal to her in the northern counties of England and Wales. Henry, who had been safely hidden by Lancastrian allies in Scotland, [[Northumberland]] and [[Yorkshire]] was captured by King Edward in 1465 and subsequently held captive in the [[Tower of London]].

==Return to power==
Queen Margaret, exiled in Scotland and later in France, was determined to win back the throne on behalf of her husband and son.  By herself, there was little she could do.  However, eventually Edward IV had a falling-out with two of his main supporters:  [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]] and his own younger brother [[George, Duke of Clarence]].  At the urging of King [[Louis XI of France]] they formed a secret alliance with Margaret.  After marrying his daughter to Henry and Margaret's son, Edward of Westminster, Warwick returned to England, defeated the Yorkists in battle, and restored Henry VI to the throne on 30 October 1470.   However, by this time, years in hiding followed by years in captivity had taken their toll on Henry.  Warwick and Clarence effectively ruled in his name.<ref>
{{cite book | title=Henry VI | first=Bertram | last=Wolffe | pages=342<U+2013>344 | publisher=Eyre Methuen | year=1981 |location=London}}
</ref>

Henry's return to the throne lasted less than six months.
Warwick soon overreached himself by declaring war on [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], whose ruler responded by giving Edward IV the assistance he needed to win back his throne by force.  He won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] on 4 May 1471, where Henry's son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]] was killed.

==Imprisonment and death==
Henry was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], where he died during the night of 21/22 May 1471. In all likelihood, Henry's opponents kept him alive rather than leave the Lancasters with a far more formidable leader in Henry's son Edward. According to the ''[[Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV]]'',  an official chronicle favourable to Edward, Henry died of [[melancholy]] on hearing news of the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] and his son's death.<ref>John W. McKenna, "Henry VI of England and the Dual Monarchy: aspects of royal political propaganda, 1422-1432", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''28''' (1965:145-62).</ref> It is widely suspected, however, that Edward IV, who was re-crowned the morning following Henry's death, had in fact ordered his murder.<ref>More likely is that with Prince Edward's death, there was no longer any reason to keep Henry alive. 
{{cite book | title=Henry VI | first=Bertram | last=Wolffe | pages=347 | publisher=Eyre Methuen | year=1981 |location=London}}
</ref>

[[William Shakespeare]] in both ''[[Henry VI Part 3|Henry VI]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' accuses Edward's younger brother [[Richard III of England|Richard of Gloucester]] (later to become Richard III) of the murder. 

King Henry VI was originally buried in [[Chertsey Abbey]]; then, in 1485, his body was moved to [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Kings2004 1002(011).jpg|thumb|King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]
Henry's one lasting achievement was his fostering of education; he founded both [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]]. Continuing a career of architectural patronage begun by his [[Henry V of England#Final words and legacy|father]], these ([[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]] and [[Eton College Chapel, Eton|Eton College Chapel]] respectively) and most of his other architectural commissions (like his completion of his father's foundation of [[Syon Abbey]]) each consisted of a late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]]-style church with a monastic and/or educational foundation attached.  Each year on the anniversary of Henry VI's death, the Provosts of Eton and King's College, Cambridge lay white lilies and roses, the floral emblems of those colleges, on the spot in the Wakefield Tower at the [[Tower of London]] where the imprisoned Henry VI was, according to tradition, murdered as he knelt at prayer.

==Posthumous cult==
[[Miracle]]s were attributed to the king, and he was informally regarded as a [[saint]] and [[martyr]], addressed particularly in cases of adversity. The cult was encouraged by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII Tudor]], as dynastic propaganda. A volume was compiled of the miracles attributed to him at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], where Richard III has reinterred him, and at the time of Henry VIII's break with Rome, canonization proceedings were under way.<ref>Leigh Ann Craig, "Royalty, Virtue, and Adversity: The Cult of King Henry VI" ''Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies'' '''35'''.2 (Summer 2003:187-209).</ref> Hymns to him still exist. Until the Reformation, his hat was kept by his tomb at Windsor where pilgrims would put it on to enlist Henry's aid against migraines.<ref name=duffy161>Eamon Duffy, ''The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, c.1400-c.1580'' 1992:161</ref>  With lessened need to legitimize Tudor rule, the cult of Henry VI faded.<ref>Craig 2003:189.</ref>

==Shakespeare's ''Henry VI'' and after==
In 1590, [[William Shakespeare]] wrote a trilogy of plays about the life of Henry VI: ''[[Henry VI, part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI, part 2]]'', and ''[[Henry VI, part 3]]''. He also appears as a ghost in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. In screen adaptations of these plays he has been portrayed by [[James Berry (actor)|James Berry]] in the 1911 silent short ''Richard III'', dramatising a part of Shakespeare's play, [[Terry Scully]] in the 1960 [[BBC]] series ''[[An Age of Kings]]'', which contained all the history plays from ''Richard II'' to ''Richard III'', [[Carl Wery]] in the 1964 West German TV version of ''K<U+00F6>nig Richard III'', [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] in ''[[War of the Roses (TV mini-series)|Wars of the Roses]]'', a 1965 filmed version of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] performing the three parts of ''Henry VI'' (condensed and edited into two plays, ''Henry VI'' and ''Edward IV'') and ''Richard III'', [[Peter Benson (actor)|Peter Benson]] in the 1983 [[BBC Shakespeare]] versions of all three parts of ''Henry VI'' and ''Richard III'', [[Paul Brennen]] in the 1989 film versions of the full cycle of consecutive history plays performed, for several years, by the [[English Shakespeare Company]], [[Edward Jewesbury]] in the 1995 film version of ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]'' (1995), with [[Ian McKellen]] as Richard, and [[James Dalesandro]] in the 2007 modern-day film version of ''[[Richard III (2007 film)|Richard III]]''.

[[Miles Mander]] portrayed him in ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'', a 1939 horror film loosely dramatising the rise to power of Richard III.
