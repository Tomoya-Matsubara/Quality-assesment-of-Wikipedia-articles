==Early life and RNZAF career== 

Lamason was born in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] on 15 September 1918, but was raised in [[Dannevirke]], a small rural community in [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]].<ref name=Thompson>Thompson, H. L. (1953). [http://books.google.com/books?id=HSlAOwAACAAJ&dq ''New Zealanders with the Royal Air Force. (Vol. 1)'']. Published by War History Branch, Dept. of Internal Affairs, Wellington. {{OCLC|270919916}}. </ref> Prior to the war, Lamason worked for the Department of Agriculture as a stock inspector.

Lamason joined the RNZAF in September 1940 and by April 1942, he was a [[pilot officer]] in [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]]. During a bombing raid on [[Pilsen]], the aircraft he was captaining was attacked by an enemy fighter and badly damaged, but managed to return to base.  As a result of his actions, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) on 15 May 1942. The full citation read:

{{quote|''Air Ministry, 15th May, 1942.''

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the following awards in recognition of gallantry displayed in flying operations against the enemy: <U+2014>

Pilot Officer Philip John. LAMASON, (N.Z. 403460), Royal New Zealand Air Force, No. 218 Squadron.

One night in April, 1942, this officer was the captain of an aircraft which attacked
Pilsen. During the return flight his aircraft was attacked by an enemy fighter and sustained damage; the hydraulics were shot away and the turret rendered unserviceable, while a fire broke out in the middle of the fuselage. Displaying great presence of mind, Pilot Officer Lamason coolly directed his crew in the emergency and, while 2 of them dealt with the fire, he skilfully outmanoeuvred his attacker and finally shook him off. By his fine airmanship and great devotion to duty, Pilot Officer Lamason was undoubtedly responsible for the safe return of the aircraft and its crew. This officer has completed 21 sorties and he has at all times displayed courage and ability.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=35560|supp=yes|startpage=2121|date=12 May 1942|accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>}}

== Buchenwald ==
On 8 June 1944, Lamason was serving as a [[flight (military unit)|flight]] commander in a [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] of [[No. 15 Squadron RAF]], when he was shot down during a raid on railway marshalling yards near [[Paris]].<ref name=Eden/> Lamason recalled: {{quote|On the night of the raid our bomber was spotted by a German fighter, which locked on to it. I decided to turn and fight him. Within seconds an incendiary round hit a wing and caught the fuel tank. I gave the order to bail out as the gas torched. But Robbie, our mid-upper gunner, kept on firing. When he eventually did jump, we no longer had enough height. I saw his parachute open, but too late. He must have died on impact. I pushed the navigator out and managed to jump clear at the last minute.<ref name=Eden>Eden, Richard & Oakes, John (2001).

Lamason was hidden by the [[French Resistance]] for seven weeks before being captured by the [[Gestapo]] in August after he was betrayed by the French double agent [[Jacques Desoubrie]].<ref name=Thompson/> Many fliers were classified as "Terrorflieger" (terror flier) by the Germans, and were not given a trial.

Buchenwald was a [[Nazi concentration camps|labor camp]] of about 60,000 inmates of mainly [[Russians|Russian]] POWs, but also common criminals, religious prisoners (including [[Jews]]), and various [[political prisoners]] from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Poland]], and [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=Crocker>Crocker, Brandon (2008).

He insisted that the airmen be treated as POWs under the [[Geneva Conventions]] and be sent to a [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]]. The commandant agreed that their arrival at Buchenwald was a "mistake" but they remained there anyway.<ref name=Crocker/> The airmen were given the same poor treatment and beatings as the other inmates.<ref name=USAF/> For the first three weeks at Buchenwald, the prisoners were totally shaven, denied shoes and forced to sleep outside without shelter.<ref name=Canada/>

After their first meal, Lamason stepped forward and stated: {{quote|Gentlemen, we have ourselves in a very fine fix indeed. The goons have completely violated the Geneva Convention and are treating us as common thieves and criminals. However, we are soldiers. From this time on, we will also conduct ourselves as our training has taught us and as our countries would expect from us.

Lamason proceeded to organise the airmen into groups by nationality and appointed a Commanding Officer within each group. Lamason did not do this just to improve their morale but because he also saw it as his responsibility to carry on his war duties despite the adverse circumstances.<ref name=Moser/> Lamason's leadership boosted the airmen's spirits and gave them hope while instilling a level of discipline and bearing.<ref name=Lambert/><ref name=Hope/> One of the first assignments Lamason gave was to mount a guard detail, both day and night, to prevent pilfering by other inmates, which had begun during their first night at camp.<ref name=Burgess/>

For the next six weeks, Lamason negotiated with the German camp authorities, but his requests to have the airmen transferred to proper POW camps were denied.<ref name=Thompson/><ref name=AWM/> One captured British airman, [[Pilot Officer]] S.A. Spierenburg, was a [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] flying for the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref>Air War Web Portal (2008). [http://www.airwarweb.net/dutch_raf.php Dutch Pilots in RAF Service: S.A. Spierenburg].

Most airmen doubted they would ever get out of Buchenwald because their documents were stamped with the acronym "DIKAL" (Darf in kein anderes Lager), or "not to be transferred to another camp".<ref name=Burgess/><ref name=Bard/> At great risk, Lamason secretly got word out to the German [[Luftwaffe]] of their captivity at the camp.<ref name=Hope/><ref name=Herald>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10119086 Unsung heroes of the bombing war] (2005).

Many airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason.<ref name=Thompson/><ref name=Lambert/> Captured pilot, Stratton Appleman, stated that "they were very fortunate to have Lamason as their leader".<ref name=Burgess/> Another airman, Joe Moser, stated that Lamason was a great leader who he would have been glad to follow anywhere he asked.<ref name=Moser/>

== Aftermath ==
Following their liberation and return to England, Lamason was asked to consider commanding one of the [[Okinawa]] squadrons for the final [[Operation Downfall|attack on Japan]]. However, the RNZAF refused and Lamason returned to New Zealand, arriving there the day after the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] was dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]].<ref name=Burgess/> After the war, Lamason was discharged from the air force on 16 December 1945.<ref>Hanson, C.
