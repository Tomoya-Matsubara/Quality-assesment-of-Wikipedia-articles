'''Bryan James Gunn''' (born 22 December 1963 in [[Thurso]]) is a Scottish former professional [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and [[manager (association football)|football manager]]. After learning his trade with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in the early 1980s, he spent most of his playing career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], the club with which he came to be most closely associated. This was followed by a brief spell back in Scotland with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] before his retirement as a player in 1998.

Gunn feels the peak of his playing career was making what he calls the [[Glossary of association football terms#Save|save]] of his life in [[Bayern Munich v Norwich City|the UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich]] in 1993. This event was called the summit of Norwich City's history by ''[[The Independent]]''. He is one of only nine Norwich players to win the club's [[Norwich City F.C. Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] award twice. He was made an inaugural member of [[Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame|Norwich City's Hall of Fame]]. He was a member of the [[Scotland national football team]], making six appearances for his country in the early 1990s.

Gunn worked for years behind the scenes at Norwich in a variety of roles, from matchday hosting to coaching. He was appointed temporary manager towards the end of the [[2008-09 Football League Championship|2008<U+2013>09 season]] and then confirmed as permanent manager during the summer. However,  after a 7<U+2013>1 home defeat in the opening game to local rivals [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], he lost his job a week into the [[2009<U+2013>10 Football League One]] season.

Since the death of his young daughter from [[leukaemia]] in 1992, Gunn has been extensively involved in fundraising to combat the disease and its effects. As of 2011 he has raised more than <U+00A3>1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects to improve the lives of children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of [[Norwich]] recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him [[List of Shrievalties|Sheriff]] for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, ''In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography'', includes a foreword by his former manager [[Alex Ferguson]].

==Early life==
Gunn was born on 22 December 1963 in [[Thurso]], Scotland,<ref name="awkward" /> "ten miles from [[John o' Groats|John o<U+2019>Groats]]"<!-- sic -->.<ref name="fixed">{{Cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article997906.ece | work = [[The Times]] | location = London | title = Gunn fixed on target | first = Rick| last = Broadbent | date = 19 January 2004|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> His parents were James Gunn, a long-distance lorry driver, and Jessie Sinclair, a canteen worker at the [[Dounreay]] nuclear power plant; the pair had married despite being on opposite sides of a family feud stretching back to the 16th century.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=2}} James was an amateur sportsman, playing football on the right wing for local team [[Invergordon F.C.]] and winning medals at [[highland games]] events.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=5}}

The Gunn family home in Thurso was a farm,{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=3}} and the young Bryan would often pester the farmhands to play football with him. They would use a [[turnip]] if no ball was available.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=3}} By the age of four he was keen on goalkeeping; he was fearless of injury and enjoyed diving on the ball.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=3}} When Bryan was four-and-a-half, the family moved to [[Invergordon]], 20 miles from [[Inverness]].{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=3}} He attended Park Primary School in the town and joined the school football team.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=6}} Future professional [[Bobby Geddes]] was favoured over him as first-choice goalkeeper for the team;{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=6}} Gunn played as an [[Glossary of association football terms#O|outfield player]] until Geddes moved on to secondary school.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=7}}

Gunn attended secondary school at [[Invergordon Academy]] from 1975 to 1980,{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=8}} and gained [[O Level]]s in a variety of subjects, including English, maths, history and chemistry. He failed his French exam after taking it while "on the road" with [[Scotland national under-15 football team|Scotland under-15s]].{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=20}} At the age of 13, he was invited to play for the under-15 Invergordon F.C. team by one of his school teachers, who managed the team.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=9}} The team was beaten 9<U+2013>0 in Gunn's debut,{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=9}} but his subsequent performances attracted the attention of national selectors, and he joined the Scotland under-15 squad around the same time he signed for [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] at age 14.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rchs.uhi.ac.uk/RJ2000c/rj2000_12_dec/dec15/Reflections/index.html | publisher = [[University of the Highlands and Islands]]| title = Reflections| accessdate=15 March 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110410031107/http://www.rchs.uhi.ac.uk/RJ2000c/rj2000_12_dec/dec15/Reflections/index.html|archivedate=10 April 2011}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Aberdeen===
[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Alex Ferguson standing inside a stadium|The manager of Aberdeen, [[Alex Ferguson]], mentored Gunn.]]
Gunn commenced his professional career with Aberdeen in 1980,<ref name="Aberdeen">{{cite web | url = http://www.afc.co.uk/articles/20080914/rmd-fps-interview_2260392_1393830 | publisher = [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen F.C]] | title = RMD Fps interview| accessdate =8 March 2011}}</ref> and forged a good relationship with then-Aberdeen manager [[Alex Ferguson]]<U+2014>evidenced by the fact that in 1997 Ferguson brought [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] to [[Carrow Road]] for Gunn's [[testimonial match]].<ref name="fixed" /> While an apprentice at Aberdeen, Gunn was a frequent babysitter for Ferguson's children.<ref name="peppers">{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/mar/23/birmingham-norwich-championship | work = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | accessdate =8 March 2011 | title = Gunn peppers Birmingham's automatic promotion hopes | first=Phil | last=Shaw|date = 23 March 2009}}</ref> He later said, "I probably babysat more than I played".<ref name="Aberdeen" /> Gunn portrays the relationship as warm, but businesslike:<ref name="fixed" />

{{quote|I'd stay over and we'd read the Sunday papers together. He was good to me. I was struggling for cash once and went in and told him I was going on holiday and was there any chance of an advance. He got on the phone and said: "Big Bryan Gunn's coming down to sign a new contract." It wasn't what I meant. I got my holiday money but he got another year out of me, too.}}

As a youngster, Gunn did not always play in goal and he was viewed as a handy outfield player in his early years at Aberdeen.<ref name="HoFs" /> Ferguson recalls, "He could strike a ball as well as anyone, so well in fact that I once played him at centre-forward in a reserve match ... He scored a brilliant goal ... It was a marvellous moment."{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=xiii<U+2013>xiv}} However, as a professional, and at his adult height of {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}},<ref name="soccerbase">{{cite web | url = http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=3143| title = Bryan Gunn| publisher =[[Soccerbase]]|accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref> Gunn settled into playing in goal.<ref name="HoFs" />

Gunn ascribes much of his goalkeeping success to the support of Belgian [[Marc de Clerck]], a specialist goalkeeping coach at Aberdeen. At a time when few British teams provided such training,<ref name="Aberdeen" /> de Clerck introduced Gunn and Scottish international keeper [[Jim Leighton]] to what were then innovative training techniques. The goalkeepers would participate in special drills whilst training with the rest of the squad.<ref name="Aberdeen" /> Gunn also notes the influence of Aberdeen coach [[Teddy Scott]], who taught the value of hard work and dedication;<ref name="Aberdeen" /> Gunn also served as a [[boot boy]] for [[Alex McLeish]].<ref name="peppers" /> Leighton's presence meant that Gunn played only 21 games for Aberdeen.<ref name="awkward">{{cite web | url = http://www.afc.co.uk/page/PlayerArchive/0,,10284,00.html | publisher= [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen F.C]] | accessdate =8 March 2011| title = Player archive | at= Reader must specify "Bryan Gunn" in Name field and select Update}}</ref> He made his debut against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]] on 30 October 1982,<ref name="HoFs" /> and went on to keep four [[clean sheets]] for the club.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.afc.co.uk/articles/20090401/afc-goalkeepers-_2212158_1631076| publisher = [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen F.C]] | accessdate =23 March 2011|title = Aberdeen's Goalkeepers 1970<U+2013>2009 | date=1 April 2009}}</ref> Despite being rivals for a first-team place, Gunn had an excellent relationship with Leighton that included joining Leighton's family for a meal once a week.<ref name="Aberdeen" />

Gunn's training and performances for the reserve team and occasional first-team appearances paid dividends: he was called up for the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21 team]], and made his debut in November 1983 against [[East Germany national under-21 football team|East Germany]].<ref name="Aberdeen" />{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=54}} He also received [[Scottish League Cup]]{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=60}} and [[European Cup Winners Cup]]<ref name="ecwc" /> winner's medals while with Aberdeen, although he was an unused substitute in both finals. He made an unexpected appearance in the [[1985<U+2013>86 European Cup#Quarter-finals|1986 European Cup quarter final]], against [[IFK G<U+00F6>teborg|Gothenburg]]. "Jim and I were warming up and he lost [his] contact lenses [so] I ended up being included in the starting line up," Gunn recalls.<ref name="Aberdeen" /> Gunn had an excellent match: ''[[The Glasgow Herald]]'''s match report stated, "Only outstanding work by [[Willie Miller]] and Bryan Gunn kept the Swedes at bay".<ref name="Swede">{{Cite news | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F7xAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w6UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3785,1343778&dq=bryan+gunn&hl=en| title = European Nightmare for Aberdeen| page=22|first=Jim|last=Reynolds|date=6 March 1986|accessdate=29 March 2011|work=[[The Glasgow Herald]]|location=Glasgow}}</ref> As well as making several key saves, he was credited with playing a part in Aberdeen's second goal following a long kick upfield.<ref name="Swede" />

As Leighton was unlikely to be dislodged, Ferguson promised to find Gunn another club,<ref name="fixed" /> and fulfilled his pledge when he sold him for <U+00A3>100,000 to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in October 1986.<ref name="HoFs">{{cite web | url = http://www.aberdeensportscouncil.com/Gothenburg%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Special.pdf | publisher = Aberdeen Sports Council | accessdate =8 March 2011|format=PDF | title = Hall of Fame special}}</ref> The transfer nearly went through in the summer of 1986, but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=72}}

===Norwich City===
[[File:KenBrown.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Ken Brown| [[Ken Brown (footballer born 1934)|Ken Brown]], the Norwich manager who signed Bryan Gunn for the Norfolk club]]
Gunn says of the move south: "Norwich was easy to settle into, a bit like Aberdeen in many ways<U+2014>a city surrounded by lovely countryside and lots of farms."<ref name="square" /> However, since he joined the club partway into the new season, he initially found it difficult to take over as first-choice goalkeeper.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=72}} Gunn had been bought as a replacement for England international goalkeeper [[Chris Woods]], who had moved to [[Rangers F.C.]] Meanwhile, reserve team keeper [[Graham Benstead]] made a series of good performances and Norwich were top of the league.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=72}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/A-ZofDiamonds/0,,10784~1219414,00.html| publisher = [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds F.C]]| title = Graham Benstead| accessdate =22 March 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110703030330/http://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/A-ZofDiamonds/0,,10784~1219414,00.html|archivedate=3 July 2011}}</ref> Ken Brown wanted to be fair to Benstead and made Gunn wait.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=72}} A 6<U+2013>2 defeat at [[Anfield]] proved to be the catalyst for Gunn's promotion to the first team.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=72}} He made his debut in a [[Full Members Cup]] win against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], conceding a penalty,{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=73}} and made his league debut in a 2<U+2013>1 victory against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at Carrow Road on 8 November 1986.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=74<U+2013>75}}

Norwich went on to finish [[1986-87 in English football#First Division|fifth in the First Division]] in his first season, their highest-ever league finish at the time.<ref name="square" /> By May 1988 Gunn's consistency meant his value had risen considerably, and the club reportedly declined a <U+00A3>500,000 offer from [[Ian Porterfield]] to take the goalkeeper back to Aberdeen.<ref name="500K">{{Cite news | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4TpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3466,3814404&dq=bryan+gunn&hl=en| title = Porterfield fails to catch a keeper|work = [[The Glasgow Herald]]|location=Glasgow|page=40|date=13 May 1988| accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> The purpose of the proposed transfer was to replace Leighton, who by then had moved to Manchester United, where he was reunited with Alex Ferguson.<ref name="500K" />

Norwich reached the semi-final of the [[FA Cup]] in 1989 with Gunn in goal, but he missed the semi-final in 1992 through injury. What has been described as his<U+2014>and Norwich's<U+2014>greatest moment came in their [[Bayern Munich v Norwich City|upset victory]] over European giants [[Bayern Munich]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] in 1993.

In November 1989, Gunn was involved in a controversial incident that attracted significant media attention.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} Norwich played [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] and with five minutes remaining, Arsenal's [[David O'Leary]] scored an equaliser that brought the scores to 3<U+2013>3. Then, in the dying seconds of the match, the referee awarded Arsenal a [[penalty kick]]<U+2014>and the chance to seal the match. The Norwich players were already annoyed by the match situation, and their perception was that the decision was "really dodgy".{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} Gunn saved [[Lee Dixon]]'s shot, but the ball was not cleared. In the resulting melee, [[Mark Bowen (footballer)|Mark Bowen]] and [[Ian Culverhouse]] for Norwich and [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1962)|Alan Smith]] for Arsenal challenged for the ball.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} "The three of them got in an almighty tangle and the ball, along with all of them, was bundled over the line," Gunn remembers.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} The goal was awarded, but the situation rapidly deteriorated: the three players in the goal had "a little skirmish". Separately, Arsenal's [[Nigel Winterburn]] gave "a gloat to [[Dale Gordon]], who promptly pushed him".{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} The result was mayhem:
<blockquote>All of a sudden it was kicking off, big time. Everyone started piling in, right in front of me... The only people not involved were [Arsenal players] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me... I went over to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. I felt it was my job to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other."{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}}</blockquote>

All but one of the 22 players on the pitch were involved in the fracas,<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.pinkun.com/home/it_can_be_reffing_hell_in_charge_of_canaries_1_644478| title = It can be reffing hell in charge of Canaries |first = David|last=Cuffley|accessdate =23 May 2011|date = 14 February 2009| location=Norfolk|publisher=[[Archant]]| work = The Pink 'Un}}</ref> but no one was sent off. The next day, the newspapers carried headlines and photos of what they called 'The Highbury Brawl'.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} That afternoon, Gunn received a phone call from a ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' journalist, who told him that the Arsenal players had said Gunn had instigated the fight.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} Enraged,{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} the Norwich keeper retorted that it was the other way around. Monday's headline read "Gunn blames Arsenal".{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}} Gunn was censured by the [[Football Association]] and warned about his future conduct. Both clubs were fined, and Gunn was docked a fortnight's wages (about <U+00A3>800) by Norwich City.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|pp=123<U+2013>125}}

Under the management of [[Gary Megson]], Norwich were seventh in the Premier League in the 1994<U+2013>95 season<ref name="square2" /> when Gunn broke and dislocated his ankle whilst playing against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-beleaguered-ipswich-pick-burley-1390876.html| work = [[The Independent]] | title = Football: Beleaguered Ipswich pick Burley| first = Andy|last=Martin|date=29 December 1994|accessdate=22 March 2011| location=London}}</ref> His importance to the team was underlined when they subsequently plummeted down the table, winning just one of their remaining 17 games as Gunn recovered.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/3395/38/| work = [[When Saturday Comes]]| location=London| title = Nightmare for Norwich | date = 5 May 2009 | accessdate =22 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.football.co.uk/hull_city/megson-_no_favours_for_hull_rss104457.shtml| title = Megson: No favours for Hull| accessdate =22 March 2011|date = 15 May 2009 | publisher = [[Eurosport]]}}</ref> The team was ultimately relegated.<ref name="seasons" /> Gunn retained a regular first team place for the 1995-96 season and, beginning with the match against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 17 February 1996, began to [[captain (association football)|captain]] the side, initially in the absence of regular captain [[Jon Newsome]] then on a permanent basis after Newsome left the club. However, when [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]] took over as manager for the following 1996-97 season, he appointed [[Ian Crook]] as captain instead.

Gunn's reflections on joining Hibernian are tinged with regret: "[leaving Norwich was] very difficult indeed.

Gunn represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at the youth international level. He was part of the squad that won the 1982 [[UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship]]<!-- tournament has subsequently been renamed -->, but was unavailable to play in the final because Aberdeen had reached the [[1982 Scottish Cup Final]]. He was replaced by [[Robin Rae]] for the final, in which the Scots beat Czechoslovakia 3<U+2013>1.<ref name="u19 champion">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article520082.ece|title=Caught in Time: Scotland are European youth champions, 1982|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=8 May 2005|last=White|first=Neil|accessdate=8 March 2011|location=London}}</ref>

During the first half, after the side had gone 4<U+2013>0 down, two supporters approached the Norwich bench, appearing to throw their season tickets at Gunn.<ref name="megadefeat" /> Many fans walked out before the match ended, and around 300 people protested outside the ground afterwards.<ref name="daily mail fired" /> Media coverage of the match was unsurprisingly negative: the BBC used terms such as "calamitous defending", "Colchester run riot", "dismal", and a "disastrous start";<ref name="terminate" /> journalists also speculated about Gunn's competence as a manager.<ref name="terminate" /> Matters seemed to stabilise a little with a 4<U+2013>0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win at [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil]] the following Tuesday.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/8190090.stm | title = Yeovil 0<U+2013>4 Norwich| publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate =13 May 2011|date = 11 August 2009}}</ref> However, Gunn was sacked by McNally on 14 August 2009, six days after the defeat by Colchester.<ref name="megadefeat" />

Gunn was influenced in his management philosophy by former Norwich manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]].<ref name="sos" /> Himself a former goalkeeper, Walker believed<U+2014>contrary to popular opinion<U+2014>that goalkeepers can make good managers because their excellent view of the game enables them to develop a good tactical awareness.<ref name="sos" /> Gunn's short time at Norwich remains his only experience of professional football management and he has subsequently moved into a business career.<ref name="sbase" />

Gunn explained that he was unsure what her attitude would be to footballers;{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=101}} he later confessed his calling to her. He proposed within three days of their meeting,<ref name="Susan" /> and they were married the following year.<ref name="Susan" /> They lived in [[Framingham Pigot]], near Norwich, until moving to [[Cheshire]] in May 2011.<ref name="agent" /> The Gunns have had three children: Francesca, Melissa and Angus.<ref name="Susan" /> Melissa is a model,<ref name="sos" /> while their son, Angus, is a footballer and plays in goal, like his father.<ref name="Angus">{{Cite news | url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city-fc/norwich_city_s_gunn_gets_chance_to_shine_for_england_1_675710| work = [[Eastern Daily Press]] | location = Norfolk | accessdate =8 March 2011 | date = 7 October 2010|title = Norwich City<U+2019>s Gunn gets chance to shine for England | first = David |last=Cuffley}}</ref> On the books as a youth player at Norwich City, in October 2010 he was selected for [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16s]], a full year ahead of the age group.<ref name="Angus" /><ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=David|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/youth-football/2011/03/29/ex-scotland-keeper-bryan-gunn-s-son-set-to-keep-goal-for-england-against-scots-86908-23023524/|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] | location=Glasgow|accessdate=30 March 2011|date=29 March 2011|title = Victory Shield: Ex-Scotland keeper Bryan Gunn's son set to keep goal <U+2013> for England against Scots}}</ref>

According to ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', Gunn suffers from [[ankylosing spondylitis]], "a rheumatic spinal condition", diagnosed in about 1995, "which he controls with medication".<ref name="sos" /> He appeared in an [[ITV2]] celebrity football quiz called "Taking the Pitch" in 1998, alongside singer [[Fish (singer)|Fish]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.the-company.com/email/e1998-11-04.htm| title = Subject: Fish 98 <U+2013> Setlists, American CD's, VH1 and other stories | publisher = the-company.com | accessdate =11 May 2011 | date = 4 November 1998}}</ref> Gunn's autobiography<U+2014>''In Where it Hurts''<U+2014>was published in 2006, and includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.<ref name="author" /> He said of writing the book, "it brought up a lot of good memories and a lot of awkward memories".<ref name="Aberdeen" /> The book was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as "shot through with sharp humour and astute observation".<ref name="author" /> The publishers agreed to donate <U+00A3>1 to Gunn's Leukaemia appeal fund for every book sold.<ref name="square2" />

===Leukaemia appeal===
In 1992, Gunn's two-year-old daughter, Francesca, was diagnosed with [[leukaemia]].<ref name="fixed" /> Norwich City fans were at first astonished by the sight of the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head.{{sfn|Baldwin|1993|p=102}} In the words of author and Norwich supporter, Kevin Baldwin, "Occasionally, the gap between the crowd and the players can cause unfortunate misunderstandings. A few months ago, Gunn shaved his head and we all laughed at him ... I was especially keen ... to shout "Baldy!" ... It now turns out that his daughter was undergoing chemotherapy at the time, which made her hair fall out. He shaved his head to show her that this was nothing to be ashamed of. Sorry, Bryan."{{sfn|Baldwin|1993|p=102}} When news spread of the reason for Gunn's shaven head, he received "support from the whole of the sporting world and the people of Norfolk".<ref name="Giving">{{cite web | url = http://www.charitygiving.co.uk/minisites/default.asp?subname=bryangunn | title = Bryan Gunn's appeal home page | publisher = Charity Giving| accessdate =8 March 2011}}</ref>

Gunn describes the period of Francesca's illness and death and how it caused him to reflect on his career:
<blockquote>"We had a charmed life ... then Francesca became ill. There was a game in the autumn of '92 ... that we lost 7<U+2013>1 at Blackburn. The team stayed in a bleak hotel and it rained endlessly. I just wanted to get back home. With hindsight you think, 'Why the bloody hell was I playing?' Very soon afterwards, Francesca died. She was sleeping between us. I realised what was happening and woke Susan. We cradled Francesca and cried."<ref name="author" /></blockquote>

Francesca died in 1992, aged two.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/ExHibs-keepers-cancer-charity-comes.2778391.jp |title=Ex-Hibs keeper's cancer charity comes to Capital |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2011 |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]|location=Edinburgh}}</ref> Gunn played a match for Norwich against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] at Carrow Road just days after his daughter died; he said of it, "When I ran out, I thought, wow, I could feel the whole stadium was with me. I never thought about packing it in."<ref name="fixed" /> At the end of the season, Gunn won [[Norwich City player of the year|Norwich's player of the year award]],<ref name="bbcnorfolk">{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2009/01/19/brian_gunn_20090119_feature.shtml | title = Gunning his way to success | publisher = BBC Norfolk | accessdate =9 March 2011 | date = 21 January 2009}}</ref> as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.<ref name="bbcnorfolk" />

Following Francesca's death, Gunn established "Bryan Gunn's Leukaemia Appeal", a fund to raise money to combat the disease. He initially set a target of <U+00A3>10,000,<ref name="fixed" /> but by 2011 he has raised <U+00A3>1,000,000,<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.bryangunnsappeal.org/| title = Bryan Gunn's Appeal | publisher=bryangunnsappeal.org|accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref> under the auspices of [[The Dove Trust]].<ref name="gaps">{{Cite news | url = http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/gunn_cancer_helpline_goes_nationwide_1_538453 | title = Gunn cancer helpline goes nationwide| first=Mark | last=Nicholls| work = [[Eastern Daily Press]] | location=Norfolk| accessdate =10 March 2011| date = 2 January 2006}}</ref> The fund aims to address three issues:
<blockquote>
"Equipping local hospitals to be better able to deal with children suffering from the disease on both in-patient and out-patient bases. Providing training for nurses and other staff involved in the care of children with leukaemia over and above that which is available from their employers. To support<!-- sic --> further research into the causes and cures of leukaemia."<ref name="Giving" /></blockquote>

The third of these ambitions has prompted the funding of research into leukaemia at the Norwich-based [[University of East Anglia]]. Gunn says:
<blockquote>"The ultimate aim is to find a cure and if that can be done in the laboratory at the University of East Anglia bearing Francesca's name, then it would be the biggest testimony of all. Norwich is now one of the leading centres for leukaemia research and, with links to computer systems around the world, hopefully we'll get there."<ref name="fixed" /></blockquote>

In addition to the research, Gunn set up a telephone support line that offers advice and assistance for parents of children who have leukaemia or other forms of cancer.<ref name="gaps" /> Known as gaps:line (an [[acronym]] for Gunn Appeal Parent Support), the service quickly grew. From its initial pilot launch in Norfolk in early 2004, it expanded to cover the "eastern region" by the end of the year, and launched nationally in early 2006.<ref name="gaps" /> The appeal has also funded other research and support work.<ref name="Giving" />

==Playing style, personality, achievements and legacy==
As a player, Gunn was described as a "a leader with a big presence" by his manager at Hibernian, Alex McLeish.<ref name="highbeam" /> Aberdeen manager Alex Ferguson recalls, "the first thing that hit me was his personality. It was abundantly clear ... that he was a warm, outgoing and endearing character",{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=xiii}} adding "He was a tremendous young keeper... always totally professional and I could never fault his discipline, effort or commitment."{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=xiv}}

Gunn had a "fantastic rapport with the Norwich supporters".{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=74}} As a player, he liked "to tease the crowd during the game".{{sfn|Baldwin|1993|p=101}} Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to [[head-butt]] the [[Goal (sport)#Association football|crossbar]].{{sfn|Baldwin|1993|p=101}} Gunn says this is a habit he began as a youngster,{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=73}} and cannot remember how or why he began to do it.{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=74}} Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small "Wooo..." which would build into a full-blown "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times".{{sfn|Gunn|Piper|2006|p=74}} <!-- Gunn did actually make contact with the bar before a match against xxxx in xxxx, and played the game despite some symptoms of concussion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} --> During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".{{sfn|Baldwin|1993|p=101}}

Gunn is described as "a legend in Norwich",<ref name="sos">{{cite news|last=Forsyth|first=Paul|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/sport/Interview-Gunn-slings-his-hat.4910961.jp|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|location=Edinburgh| publisher=|date=25 January 2009|accessdate=15 March 2011|title=Interview: Gunn slings his hat in the ring at City}}</ref> the result of his long years of service as player and official for the club.<ref name="sos" /> In 2002, he was made one of 25 inaugural members of the [[Norwich City F.C.
