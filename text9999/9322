Emma Watson was born in Paris, France, the daughter of Jacqueline Luesby and Chris Watson, both English lawyers.<ref name="emmabio"/> Watson has one French grandmother,<ref name="lifeafterpotter"/> and lived in Paris until the age of five, before she moved with her mother and younger brother Alexander to [[Oxford]], England, following her parents' divorce.<ref name="emmabio"/> 

From the age of six, Watson expressed a desire to become an actress.<ref name="emmaemma"/> By the time she was ten, she had starred in several school plays, including ''Arthur: The Young Years'' and ''The Happy Prince''.<ref name="emmabio">{{cite web| url=http://www.emmawatsonofficial.com/#bio|title=Biography|first=Emma|last=Watson|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=Emma Watson's Official Website}}</ref> She had never acted in any professional capacity prior to being cast in the ''Harry Potter'' series.

==Career==
===Harry Potter===
<!--  ***EDITORS: DO **NOT** CHANGE "PHILOSOPHER'S" TO "SORCERER'S" - READ [[MOS:HPP#ENGLISH]]***  -->
In 1999, casting began for ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (known as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in the United States), the film adaptation of British author [[J. K. Rowling]]'s bestselling [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|novel]].<ref name="emmaemma">{{cite web| url=http://www.emmawatsonofficial.com/#emma |title=Emma |first=Emma |last=Watson |accessdate=2007-08-03 |publisher=Emma Watson's Official Website}}</ref>  Of paramount importance to the casting directors were the lead role of [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and the two supporting roles of Hermione Granger and [[Ron Weasley]], Harry's two best friends. Casting agents found Watson through her Oxford theatre teacher,<ref name="emmaemma"/> and producers were impressed by her self-confidence. After eight auditions, producer [[David Heyman]] told Watson and fellow applicants Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint that they had been cast for the roles of Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Author Rowling was said to be supportive of Watson from the time of her first [[screen test]].<ref name="emmaemma"/>

Watson's debut as Hermione came in 2001 with the release of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''.<!-- EDITORS: Please do not change "Philosopher's"<U+2014>see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Describing_points_of_view#Nationalism --> The film broke box office records for opening-day sales and opening weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Box_Office_Analysis_Harry_Potter_breaks_records/1097810|title="Harry Potter" magically shatters records|accessdate=2007-09-21|date=[[2001-11-18]]|publisher=''Hollywood.com''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2001&p=.htm|title=2001 Worldwide Grosses|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>  Critics praised the performances of the three leads, often singling  out Watson for particular acclaim. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called her performance "admirable",<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|title=Magic is the only word for it|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/11/05/npot105.xml|accessdate=2007-09-23|date=[[2007-11-04]]}}</ref> and [[IGN]] said she "stole the show".<ref>{{cite news|title=Review of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone|publisher=''[[IGN]]''|first=Brian|last=Linder|date=[[2001-11-17]]|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/316/316273p1.html|accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref> Watson was nominated for five awards for her performance in ''Philosopher's Stone'', winning the [[Young Artist Award]] for Leading Young Actress.<ref name="YAA"/>

A year later, Watson again starred as Hermione in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', the second installment of the series. Though the film received mixed reviews because of its pace and direction, critics were generally positive about the performances. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that Watson and her peers had matured between films,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan15nov15,0,1767241.story|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051228225730/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan15nov15,0,1767241.story|archivedate=2005-12-28|title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|accessdate=2007-09-22|date=[[2002-11-15]]|author=Kenneth Turan|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''}}</ref> while ''[[The Times]]'' criticised director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] for "under-employing" Watson's hugely popular character.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film of the week|first=Barbara|last=Ellen| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article828645.ece|accessdate=2007-09-23|date=2002-11-14|publisher=''[[The Times]]''}}</ref> Watson received an Otto Award from the German magazine ''[[Die Welt]]'' for her performance.<ref name=bravo-archiv-2003/>

In 2004, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' was released. Watson was appreciative of the more assertive role Hermione played in this film, calling her character "charismatic" and "a fantastic role to play".<ref name="radcliffegrintwatson">{{cite web| first = Jonathon| last = Trout|date=[[2004-06-01]] | title = Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson| url=  http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/06/01/daniel_radcliffe_emma_watson_rupert_grint_azkaban_interview.shtml | accessdate = 2007-08-03|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Although critics largely turned away from Radcliffe's acting talent, increasingly labelling him as wooden, Watson continued to be praised; ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded her performance, saying "Luckily Mr. Radcliffe's blandness is offset by Ms. Watson's spiky impatience. Harry may show off his expanding wizardly skills&nbsp;... but Hermione&nbsp;... earns the loudest applause with a decidedly unmagical punch to Draco Malfoy's deserving nose".<ref>{{cite news|title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: Film review|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|author=A.

With ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]), both Watson and the ''Harry Potter'' film series reached new milestones.  The film set new records for a ''Harry Potter'' opening weekend, a non-May opening weekend in the US, and an opening weekend in the UK.  Critics praised the increasing maturity of Watson and her teenage co-stars; the ''New York Times'' called her performance "touchingly earnest".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www10.nytimes.com/2005/11/17/movies/17pott.html?_r=5&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|accessdate=2007-09-24|title=The Young Wizard puts away childish things|first=Manohla|last=Dargis|date=[[2005-11-17]]|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref> For Watson, much of the humour of the film sprang from the tension among the three lead characters as they matured.

She explained that the decision was a tough one, as filming would continue to dominate her life for the next three to four years, but in the end, "the pluses outweighed the minuses".<ref name="parade"/> Filming for ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the sixth film, began in late 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/latestheadlines/display.var.1766543.0.village_set_for_harry_potter_filming.php|title=Village set for Harry Potter filming|publisher=The Wiltshire Times|date=[[2007-10-18]]|accessdate=2008-01-12|first=Katie|last=Adams}}</ref>

Although Radcliffe and Grint have confirmed their commitment to an acting career, Watson has expressed uncertainty about her future plans.
