'''Access Computer''' was the common name for the ''Access Matrix'' a luggable computer introduced in 1982 by a United States computer company, 'Access Matrix Corp' (AM CORP on FCC documentation). The company was shortly renamed 'Actrix Computer Corp' due to [[copyright]] issues, and the name of the computer-line was changed to ''Actrix'' - see [[Actrix (computer)|Actrix]].  Actrix appears to mean "''''Ac'''cess ma'''Trix'''".

== Hardware ==
The ''Access Computer'' had dual 5.25-inch floppy drives (either 320k-DS or 168k-SS) a detachable [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], a 7" built-in amber [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor, and a built-in 80 CPS Epson MX80 [[dot matrix]] printer with GRAFTRAX-80 chipset. It used the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]], and also included a Bell-103 300baud [[modem]] with both acoustic-coupled and direct connections. Additional connectors for IEEE-488 (external hard disk), composite monitor, RS2-32 serial and Centronics parallel were provided.  The mainboard has a 50-pin [[Pin header|header]] designed to support 8-inch disk drives (4 heads on two double-sided disks - drive letters C:/D: and E:/F:)

== Software ==
Access Matrix came bundled with [[MBASIC]], [[CBASIC]], the Perfect-series office software, Personal Pearl database and Fancy Font markup/formatting system. Custom-written software included a disk format/verify/duplication utility (DISKU.COM) that worked with both the internal A:/B: drives as well as optional external 8" disks (C:/D: and E:/F:). A custom-written Telecommunications utility (TELCOMU.COM) offered dialup address book, basic terminal emulation, XMODEM/Modem7 file transfer and other features for connection to [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] and other online systems or to operate as a drone to receive files uploaded from other computers.

Although not truly portable the all-in-one design did allow for quick setup and shut-down. It was rugged and although weighing 15&nbsp;kg, it was reasonably easy to transport in a car or in an aircraft's coat- locker. The Access Matrix had option of a padded cloth bag with shoulder-strap or a heavier-duty leather/cloth bound protective case with carry handle and shoulder-strap.  

Apparently the system was popular with journalists who could use the inbuilt "OFFLINE" type-writer mode to create and print simple ''ad hoc'' single-page documents ready for immediate faxing to HQ from their hotel lobby. Another option was to combine the word processing and telecommunications features to create a document using the word processing software and immediately upload the document directly to either an online services such as Compuserve or indeed to another 'waiting' Access Matrix at their head office.  

The rebadged ''Actrix DS'' was presented at the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]  [[Comdex]] in November 1983. There was another model called the ''Actrix SS'' with a 170k 5.25-inch [[disk drive]].
