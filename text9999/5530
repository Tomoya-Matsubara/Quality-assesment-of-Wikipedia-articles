The '''Irish Republican Liberation Army''' (IRLA) is the most new incarnation of the various Irish [[paramilitary]] organisations with aims to bring about a thirty-two county [[United Ireland]]. Although much of its origins are as of yet unknown, the IRLA was brought attention to itself with its threats of action. 

==Origins==
The IRLA is centred around West [[Belfast]] in the [[Ardoyne]] area.

==Threats==
In November 2007, the IRLA threatened [[Sinn Fein]] members who were involved in District Policing Partnerships. Further to these threats the IRLA were also involved in criminal activity according to the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]]. The IMC also said the IRLA has a small arms collection, though it's threat is not "terrorist in nature."<ref>http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/18.%20Eighteenth%20Report.pdf</ref>

According to the [[Hansard]]s, on [[March 5]], [[2008]], [[Sammy Wilson]] asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland [[McNulty]] if would consider prohibiting the Irish Republican Liberation Army under the Terrorism Act 2000. McNulty gave a vague response that "As a matter of normal policy and practice we do not comment on organisations not on the proscribed list."<ref>http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/text/80305w0002.htm</ref>
