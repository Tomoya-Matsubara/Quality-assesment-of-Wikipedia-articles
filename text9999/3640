'''''Castle Amber''''' is a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] [[List of Dungeons & Dragons modules|adventure module]] designed by [[Tom Moldvay]]. This was the second module designed for use with the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert D&D set]]''.<ref name="Bambra"/>

==Plot summary==
The [[player character]]s explore the haunted mansion of the Amber family, and encounter new monsters such as the brain collector.<ref name="HW"/> The module is described as a medium to high-level scenario which takes place in a castle surrounded by a strange gray mist.<ref name="Dicing with Dragons">{{cite book| first=Ian | last=Livingstone | authorlink = Ian Livingstone | year=1982| title=Dicing with Dragons, An Introduction to Role-Playing Games | edition=Revised| publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn=0710094663 }} ([http://books.google.com/books?id=UMY9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover preview])</ref>

During their night's rest on their way to [[Glantri]], the player characters are unexpectedly drawn into a large castle surrounded by an impenetrable, deadly mist. This is the result of a curse the wizard-noble Stephen Amber (''Etienne d'Amberville'') put on his treacherous relatives for murdering him.

The only way to escape Castle Amber (or ''Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Amberville'') is to explore the castle, putting up with the demented and at times insane members of the d'Amberville family and the other, often hostile, denizens, and open a hidden portal to the wilderness of the world of Averoigne, where the party can find the means to reach the inter-dimensional tomb in which Stephen Amber rests, in order to break the curse and return home.

In this world, magic is frowned upon, and spellcasters may come to the attention of the Inquisition.<ref name="Bambra"/>

==Inspirations==
The module's credits give special thanks to Clark Ashton Smith and Casiana Literary Enterprises, Inc., "for use of the Averoigne stories as inspirational material."<ref name="X2"/> Castle Amber (Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Amberville) draws from the [[Averoigne]] stories of [[Clark Ashton Smith]].<ref name="HW">{{cite book

In addition to the Averoigne references, there are individual encounters within the module that have allusions to stories written by others. 

One of the encounters in the module is an homage to (or copy of) the climax of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story [[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]][http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.frp.dnd/browse_thread/thread/6d3fd6900ac58c37/2adbb24c4dbe9f9], involving a brother who can hear his dead sister, named Madeline in both cases, crying out from the grave where she was buried alive.  The overall module has "a decidedly Edgar Allen Poe feel to it."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Games Examiner|last=Nations|first=Daniel|title=Top 10 Classic D&D Adventures|year=2008|month=November}}</ref>

Many of the creatures also had a ''Lovecraftian'' feel to them.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sernett| first=Matthew|title=Blast from the Past: X2: Castle Amber|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |volume=325 |year=2004}}</ref>

==Publication history==
''Castle Amber'' was the second module designed for use with the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|D&D Expert Set]]''.<ref name="Bambra"/> It was written by [[Tom Moldvay]] and published 1981 as a thirty two page booklet with an outer folder and a cover designed by [[Erol Otus]].<ref name="HW"/>

The module was developed by [[David Cook (game designer)|Dave Cook]], [[Allen Hammack]], [[Kevin Hendryx]], [[Harold Johnson (game designer)|Harold Johnson]], Tom Moldvay, and [[Jon Pickens]], and edited by Harold Johnson, [[Edward Sollers]], and [[Steve Winter]].<ref name="X2">[[Tom Moldvay|Moldvay, Tom]]. ''Castle Amber'', TSR, Inc., 1981</ref> It features art by [[Jim Holloway (artist)|Jim Holloway]], [[Harry Quinn (artist)|Harry Quinn]], [[Jim Roslof]], [[Stephen D. Sullivan]], and Erol Otus.<ref name="X2"/>

'''Mark of Amber''' was a sequel/remake of the original Castle Amber. It was reprinted in 1995 in the form of a boxed set, complete with an audio CD, map posters, and player handouts. It was part of the short lived ''Masters'' series. The Castle was renamed ''Ch<U+00E2>teau Sylaire''.

==Reception==
''Castle Amber'' was ranked the 15th greatest ''Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure of all time by ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' magazine in 2004,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mona| first=Erik|authorlink=Erik Mona|coauthors=James Jacobs|title=The 30 Greatest D&D Adventures of All Time|journal=[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]] |volume=116 |year=2004}}</ref> and was fondly remembered in ''Dragon'' Magazine the same year.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McArtor| first=Mike|title=Winning Races: Lupins|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |volume=325 |year=2004}}</ref>

In an earlier review in issue No. 35 of ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' magazine, reviewer Jim Bambra rated ''Castle Amber'' 6 out of 10. Bambra saw the adventure as "an attempt to bring randomness back into ''D&D''."<ref name="Bambra"/> Bambra considered ''Castle Amber'' a chaotic adventure and did not recommend it for purchase, noting that it "depends a lot on chance, leaving little room for skill, and at times can be deadly."<ref name="Bambra">{{cite journal
