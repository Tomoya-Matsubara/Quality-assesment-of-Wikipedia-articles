'''William Simpson "Bill" McAloney''' [[George Cross|GC]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (12 May 1910&nbsp;<U+2013> 31 August 1995) was a senior engineering officer in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and an [[List of Australian George Cross recipients|Australian exchange recipient]] of the [[George Cross]], the highest [[Civil awards and decorations|civil decoration]] for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Born in [[Adelaide]], he worked as a [[Auto mechanic|mechanic]] before enlisting in the RAAF as an aircraft engine [[Machinist|fitter]] in 1936. In August the following year, he attempted to rescue the pilot of a crashed [[Hawker Hart#Demon|Hawker Demon]] aircraft engulfed in flames at an airfield in [[Hamilton, Victoria]]. The first on scene, McAloney rushed into the wreckage in an effort to extract the unconscious pilot. The pilot's leg was trapped, however, and while struggling to free it one of the wing tanks burst, knocking McAloney unconscious. McAloney was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns and spent the next month in hospital. He was subsequently awarded the [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|Albert Medal]] for his actions in the rescue attempt.

McAloney sufficiently recovered to return to his work in the RAAF, and during the [[Second World War]] was primarily involved in engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia. [[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned]] as a [[flying officer]] in 1942, he saw service in [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] during late 1944. He received a permanent commission in the RAAF in 1948, and was advanced to [[squadron leader]] in 1950. During the [[Malayan Emergency]], he served as technical officer to both [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;90 Wing]] and [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Squadron]], based in [[Singapore]]. In 1960, he was made Officer Commanding Engineering Squadron at the [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit]], and was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for his efforts in the post. McAloney retired in 1966 with the honorary rank of [[group captain]]. In 1971, the Albert Medal was discontinued and living recipients of the decoration were invited to exchange their medal for the George Cross; McAloney took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the latter. He died in 1995 at the age of 85.

==Early life==
McAloney was born on 12 May 1910 in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], the eldest son of William Samuel McAloney and his wife Mary (n<U+00E9>e Murphy).<ref name="AF">{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=303}}</ref><ref name="Who">{{Harvnb|Howie|1991|p=753}}</ref><ref name="marriage">{{cite news|title=Family Notices&nbsp;<U+2013> Approaching Marriages|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/48152875?searchTerm=William%20McAloney&searchLimits=|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|date=12 June 1936|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> The young McAloney was educated at [[Thebarton Senior College|Thebarton Technical High School]] and the Adelaide School of Mines.<ref name="AF"/><ref name="Who"/><ref name="Times">{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Group Captain William McAloney, GC|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=11 September 1995|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> In 1925, McAloney registered for [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory military training]] in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizen Military Force]], serving as a [[Private (rank)|private]] with the 43rd Battalion until November 1929.

On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon aircraft of No.&nbsp;1 Squadron were on a training flight, during which they landed at an air base in [[Hamilton, Victoria]]. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public.<ref name="Times"/><ref name="Australian"/><ref name="Brothers">{{Harvnb|Coulthard-Clark|1991|pp=342<U+2013>344}}</ref> Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties.

His Majesty The KING has been graciously pleased to award the Albert Medal to Aircraftman William Simpson McAloney, Royal Australian Air Force, for conspicuous gallantry in attempting to rescue an officer from the burning wreckage of an aircraft at Hamilton, Victoria, on the 31st August, 1937.

Despite the fact that the aircraft was ablaze from nose to rudder, Aircraftman McAloney dashed into the flames and continued his efforts at rescue until pulled away in an unconscious condition, having received severe burns which necessitated his removal to hospital.}}

===Second World War===
McAloney was presented with his Albert Medal by the acting [[governor-general of Australia]], [[William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield]], in a ceremony at [[Parliament House, Melbourne]], on 31 May 1938.<ref name="Australian"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Investiture: Presentations by Lord Huntingfield|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/17469880?searchTerm=William%20McAloney&searchLimits=|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=31 May 1938|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Viceregal Investiture|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/42082516?searchTerm=William%20McAloney&searchLimits=|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|date=31 May 1938|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> McAloney recovered sufficiently from his injuries to return to his duties with the RAAF, and in September was attached to [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]] for a period of three months. During this time he was promoted to [[leading aircraftman]], before returning to service with No.&nbsp;1 Squadron.<ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/> He was formally transferred to No.&nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot from August 1939, and was advanced to [[corporal]] on 1 September that year.<ref name="ServRec"/> With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], McAloney received a rapid series of promotions over the following eighteen months, first to [[sergeant]] in April 1940, [[flight sergeant]] in March 1941, and finally to [[warrant officer]] in February 1942.<ref name="ServRec"/> He was primarily consigned to engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia during the conflict.<ref name="Australian"/> After making sergeant, he became No.&nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot's [[non-commissioned officer]] in charge of overhaul and test work on the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. His duties were expanded with his March 1941 promotion to include the overhaul, inspection and testing of both the Kestrel and [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] aircraft engines.<ref name="ServRec"/>

In August 1941, McAloney was posted to the Directorate of Equipment at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.<ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/> In this capacity he advised on the procurement of equipment and spare parts for RAAF aircraft. He was further tasked with compiling a register of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight training units and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]] to check equipment stores.<ref name="ServRec"/> On 1 March 1942, he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[flying officer]].<ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/> Transferred to the Directorate of Equipment Administration in July, McAloney was made Officer Commanding Technical and Photographic Staffs and served as a liaison between his own directorate and that of Technical Services.<ref name="ServRec"/>

Promoted to temporary [[flight lieutenant]] on 1 August 1943, McAloney was sent to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as the specialist officer on American and [[gas turbine]] jet engines.<ref name="ServRec"/> The following November, he was dispatched to [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] to rectify issues being experienced with [[Pratt & Whitney]] engines in operations by aircraft of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|1st Tactical Air Force]].

In mid-1946, McAloney was involved in an investigation into a series of engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft. The inquiry led him to visit operational and transport units throughout Australia, in an attempt to determine whether the issues were the result of substandard maintenance or defective components. He returned to his duties at the Directorate of Technical Services on the investigation's conclusion.<ref name="ServRec"/> Made [[squadron leader]] in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year.<ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/> McAloney was posted to [[Singapore]] in June 1952 as the technical officer to the [[Changi]]-based [[No. 90 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;90 (Composite) Wing]], formed specifically for service in the [[Malayan Emergency]].<ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=196|title=No. 90 Wing formed at Singapore|accessdate=1 June 2013|publisher=Air Power Development Centre}}</ref> The attachment proved short lived with the disbandment of No.&nbsp;90 Wing in December, at which point McAloney transferred to No.&nbsp;1 Squadron, then operating out of [[Tengah, Singapore|Tengah]].<ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1995|pp=246<U+2013>247}}</ref>

McAloney returned to Australia in August 1953, his next appointment being to the staff at the [[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]] in Melbourne. He possessed complete administrative control over matters pertaining to aircraft engines in this post, including the acquisition, repairs, modifications and financial expenditure on such. In 1956, he completed a course in industrial mobilisation, later undertaking a unit in industrial electronics.<ref name="ServRec"/> With his January 1957 promotion to [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]], McAloney was transferred to Maintenance Command, where he held a policy formulation position responsible for the servicing of aircraft.<ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/> He served three years in this post, being made Officer Commanding Engineering Squadron at the [[Aircraft Research and Development Unit RAAF|Aircraft Research and Development Unit]] (ARDU) in October 1960.<ref name="AF"/><ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/> The function of ARDU was to test aircraft from local and overseas manufacturers, evaluating whether they were suitable for acquisition by the RAAF.<ref>{{cite news|title=Into the Future|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/EDITIONS/4512/features/feature01.htm|newspaper=RAAF News|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref> McAloney's role focused on the supervision of maintenance for test aircraft, along with completing modifications and fitting specialised equipment trialled at ARDU.<ref name="Australian"/> The introduction into service of the [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage IIIO]] fighter coincided with his time in this post.<ref name="Times"/><ref name="Australian"/> He was set to retire from the RAAF on reaching the age limit in 1964, but his appointment was extended a further two years owing to the shortage of technical officers.<ref name="Australian"/> For his service with ARDU, McAloney was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1966 New Year Honours List.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=43855|date=1 January 1966|startpage=38|supp=yes|accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref> The recommendation for the honour credited McAloney with enhancing the safety record at ARDU, and commended his constant efforts during the adoption of the Mirage and his actions to ensure the serviceability of the diverse variety of aircraft at the unit.<ref name="Times"/><ref name="ServRec"/> He retired from the RAAF on 9 December 1966 and,<ref name="AF"/><ref name="WWII"/> in recognition of his 30 years of service,  was granted the honorary rank of [[group captain]].<ref name="AF"/><ref name="ServRec"/><ref name="Australian"/>

==Later life==
McAloney retired to his home in [[Sandringham, Victoria]], where he indulged his passions in gardening and golf.<ref name="AF"/><ref name="Who"/> In 1971, owing to the decline in status and significance of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that living recipients of the decoration would be invited to exchange their medals for the [[George Cross]], and would henceforth formally become recipients of the latter award. All six living Australian Albert Medal recipients at the time opted to accept the offer, McAloney and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, [[Jack Chalmers]], [[Stanley Frederick Gibbs|Stanley Gibbs]], [[Robert Kavanaugh]], [[Richard W. Richards|Dick Richards]] and McAloney, were presented with their George Crosses at an investiture ceremony in [[Buckingham Palace]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 12 July 1972.<ref name="AF"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=297}}</ref>
