==Plot==
Ella (Eloise Webb) lives with her wealthy parents in a beautiful estate in a peaceful kingdom. From a young age, she is taught by her mother ([[Hayley Atwell]]) to believe in the existence and presence of magic, allowing her to befriend the many animals on the estate, particularly the mice. Everything is perfect until her mother contracts a fatal illness and dies. On her deathbed, she makes Ella promise that she'll always have courage and show kindness to others. Years later, Ella's ([[Lily James]]) father ([[Ben Chaplin]]) reveals that an old acquaintance, Lord Tremaine, has passed away and he has chosen Tremaine's widow ([[Cate Blanchett]]), who has two daughters of her own, Drizella ([[Sophie McShera]]) and Anastasia ([[Holliday Grainger]]), as his second wife. Ella welcomes her step family warmly, despite the stepsisters' less than pleasant attitudes and her needing to protect her mouse friends from her stepmother's cat, Lucifer.

Soon after, Ella's father goes abroad on business. Sadly, he becomes ill and also dies. This new loss results in Lady Tremaine revealing her true cold, cruel and jealous nature. Desperate for money, she dismisses the servants and forces Ella to do all their work. Even worse, she gives Ella's room to the stepsisters, forces her to sleep in the attic, and won't even let her eat with the family. One morning, after Ella, not wanting to sleep in the cold attic, sleeps by the fireplace, her soot covered face leads her stepsisters to name her Cinderella, which Lady Tremaine (and even Ella herself) calls her. Crushed by their cruelty, Ella goes for a ride in the woods, where she encounters a hunting party. She meets one of the hunters ([[Richard Madden]]), who claims to be an apprentice named Kit who lives in the palace. Unknown to her, he's actually the only son of the land's dying king ([[Derek Jacobi]]). Despite never learning her name, Kit (a nickname given to him by his father) is enchanted by Ella's charm, kindness, and unique outlook on life and becomes obsessed with her. Upon learning that he has little time left, the King insists that Kit finds a bride at an upcoming ball. Despite the law saying that he must marry a princess, Kit can't get over the mystery girl and talks his father into letting every eligible maiden in the land attend.

When the ball is announced, the Tremaine family is ecstatic at the prospect of marrying into royalty. However, when Lady Tremaine refuses to buy Ella a new dress, Ella fashions one herself from an old dress of her mother's with help from the mice. The night of the ball begins, and Ella tries to join her step family on the way out, but Lady Tremaine, claiming that her mere presence will disgrace them, leads her daughters into ripping up the dress before leaving without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and encounters an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be her Fairy Godmother ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]). She uses her magic to turn a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage, four mice into horses, two lizards into footmen and a goose into a coachman, as well as turning Ella's dress into a gorgeous blue gown complete with glass shoes before sending her on her way with the warning that the spell only lasts until midnight.

At the ball, Ella wins the coveted first dance with Kit, whose true identity she's pleasantly surprised to learn. This irritates the Grand Duke ([[Stellan Skarsg<U+00E5>rd]]), who secretly promised Kit to a princess, a fact that Lady Tremaine overhears. After dancing, Ella and Kit tour the palace and grounds together, slowly falling in love, but before he can learn her name, the clock strikes 11:59, forcing her to flee, dropping one of her glass shoes at the palace stairs in the process. She manages to get away before the stroke of midnight and hides the other shoe in her room as a memento.

Soon after, the King dies, but not before giving his son permission to find his love. Once it's announced that every maiden in the kingdom is to try on the shoe, Ella goes to her room for hers, only to find Lady Tremaine waiting with it in her hand, having figured out her identity from her attitude after the ball. Lady Tremaine demands that Ella makes her head of the royal family and give her daughters proper husbands when she becomes queen and when she refuses, she smashes the shoe and locks Ella in her room. She then brings the shoe and identity of the mystery girl to the Grand Duke and talks him into rewarding her with title of countess and worthy husbands for her daughters. The Duke takes the shattered shoe to Kit, hoping to convince him to forget the mystery girl, but this makes him more determined than ever to find his true love.

The Grand Duke and the captain of the guards ([[Nonso Anozie]]) lead a garrison to try the remaining shoe on all the maidens in the land, all of whom are rejected by its magic, before arriving at the Tremaine estate. When the shoe rejects both stepsisters, they turn to leave, only to hear Ella singing thanks to the mice opening her bedroom window. The Grand Duke tries to leave anyway but is stopped by one of the men, who reveals himself to be Kit in disguise and demands that the captain investigate the sound. Once Ella is found, Lady Tremaine tries to forbid her from trying on the shoe, but is overruled by the captain. Sure enough, the shoe fits and Ella leaves with Kit after forgiving her stepmother, who later is forced to leave the kingdom with her daughters and the Grand Duke, never to return.

At the wedding, Kit and Ella are married and crowned king and queen. The Fairy Godmother narrates that they become the land's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the courage and kindness she promised her mother.

====Costumes====
Three-time Oscar-winning costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] was in charge of the costumes for the film.  Powell began working on concepts for the characters<U+2019> looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of "a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s."<ref name="vanityfair.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella<U+2019>s Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|website=Vogue|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2015}}

For the stepmother and stepsisters Powell had a very strong thought about the look "They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside<U+2014>a bit too much and overdone<U+2014>and ugly on the inside."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh<U+2019>s Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> While for the prince the silhouette was from the original animation, however they created a more fitted look and less masculine colors, some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden<U+2019>s eyes.

The ball gown was inspired by the Disney movie in its color and shape, "The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting." The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were made, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10.000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.

The wedding dress was another difficult project. "Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train." says Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While in the production was taking photographs of James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire, the top layer of the dress had to be redone, because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget.<ref name="vanityfair.com"/>

For the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to used crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings versions of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none of the actually wearable since it was made of crystal. For that, the visual effects had to digitally alter the leather shoes James wore on set into crystal. Alongside with the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7 million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGe-3y5EkoU|title=Magic in the Making|website=YouTube|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
''Cinderella'' received positive reviews from critics. Praise was aimed at the performances, particularly those of [[Lily James]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], the direction, and its faithfulness to the spirit and magic of the original Disney animated classic. On the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an 84% approval rating, based on 140 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Refreshingly traditional in a revisionist era, Kenneth Branagh's ''Cinderella'' proves Disney hasn't lost any of its old-fashioned magic."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cinderella_2013/|title=Cinderella|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 65 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cinderella|title=Cinderella Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref> In [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences under the age of 18 gave the film an A, aged 18-24 an A-, aged 25-34 an A, and aged 35 and up an A+, on a scale of A+ to F.<ref name="DDD"/>

David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reviewed the film at the Berlin Film Festival and praised the special effects, screenplay and Blanchett's performance and said that "anyone nostalgic for childhood dreams of transformation will find something to enjoy in an uplifting movie that invests warm sentiment in universal themes of loss and resilience, experience and maturity."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://m.hollywoodreporter.com/entry/view/id/914145|title = 'Cinderella': Berlin Review|author = David Rooney|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date = February 14, 2015|accessdate = February 14, 2015}}</ref> Likewise, Perer Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "It<U+2019>s all a bit square, big on charm, but lacking the crackle of ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'' or ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. But though this ''Cinderella'' could never replace Disney<U+2019>s animated classic, it<U+2019>s no ugly stepsister either, but a deserving companion."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/berlin-film-review-disneys-new-live-action-cinderella-1201433243/|title = Berlin Film Review: 'Cinderella'|author = Peter Debruge|work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date = February 13, 2015|accessdate = February 14, 2015}}</ref> Guy Lodge of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three stars out of five and said, "While it might have been nice to see the new-model ''Cinderella'' follow ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''{{'s}} progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/13/cinderella-review-kenneth-branaghs-perky-pretty-cupcake-of-a-fairytale|title = Cinderella review <U+2013> Kenneth Branagh's perky, pretty cupcake of a fairytale|author = Guy Lodge|work =[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date = February 13, 2015|accessdate = February 15, 2015}}</ref> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' admired the film's visual effects, production design, and called the costume design as [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-worthy, but noted its lack of star power. He went on to say, "Lush, colorful, with an emphasis on empathy and empowerment, Walt Disney's ''Cinderella'' is the best film yet in their 'turn our animated classics into live-action blockbuster' sub-genre [sic]."<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/02/23/review-disneys-cinderella-is-the-fairest-of-them-all/|title=Review: Disney's 'Cinderella' Is the Fairest of Them All|author=Scott Mendelson|work=[[Forbes]]|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref>
