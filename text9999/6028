'''''The Greatest Love''''' is a 2011 South Korean [[romantic comedy]] series broadcasted by [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]].

==Plot==
From the famed Hong Sisters comes this hit [[romantic comedy]] about true love in the fake world of entertainment.<ref>[http://www.dramafever.com/drama/3943/1/Greatest_Love/ Greatest Love] DramaFever.</ref>

'''Gu Ae-jung''' ([[Kong Hyo-jin|Gong Hyo-jin]]) was the most popular member of girl group Kukbo Sonyeo, literally meaning "National Treasure Girls," some 10 years ago, but fell from grace after becoming embroiled in scandals. She makes appearances on television programs to eke out a living for her troublemaker father and brother. On the other hand '''Dokko Jin''' ([[Cha Seung Won|Cha Seung-won]]) is the most beloved star in the nation, topping all kinds of popularity polls and appearing in many commercials, but has several character flaws. Ae-jung discovers a secret about Jin by chance and reveals it on a talk show, incurring his fury. However, their ill-fated relationship unfolds in an unexpected way as Jin falls for Ae-jung and tries to win her heart.<ref name="koreatimes: article">[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/05/201_86326.html TV soap to peek into celebrity life] Korea Times. May 3, 2011.</ref> 

[[Yoo In-na]] plays the role of another star '''Kang Se-ri''', who used to be in Kukbo Sonyeo with Ae-jung. But whereas Ae-jung was more famous in her heyday and Se-ri was a nobody, now every girl wants to be just like Kang Se-ri. She dated Dokko Jin for a short time, but despite their breakup, they keep up the pretense that they<U+2019>re still dating to avoid negative publicity. Se-ri is also the host of popular TV dating show ''Couple Making Season 3''. <ref name="mbc global: synopsis">[http://content.mbc.co.kr/english/drama/11/1800265_39131.html Synopsis and Character Descriptions] MBC Global Media.</ref>

[[Yoon Kye-sang]] portrays '''Yoon Pil-joo''', a well-mannered, thoughtful and caring doctor of Oriental medicine. He has no interest in celebrities and their outrageous lives. Under pressure from his mother, he agrees to appear on a TV dating show, but after finding out that Ae-jung will also be appearing on the same show, he becomes very eager to meet her.<ref name="koreatimes: article"/><ref name="mbc global: synopsis"/> Fictional dating show ''Couple Making Season 3'' is based on [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]]<U+2019>s real variety program ''[[We Got Married]]'', where they throw celebrities into fake relationships for the cameras. The concept is a competition-based ''mat-seon'' program, essentially setting up people on blind dates for the purposes of finding a marriage partner. The major difference is that in ''Couple Making'', celebrity ladies compete over a non-celebrity eligible bachelor who gives them roses to prevent their elimination (a la ''[[The Bachelor (TV series)|The Bachelor]]''), which is how Yoon Pil-joo ends up as a contestant on the show. <ref name="dramabeans">[http://www.dramabeans.com/2011/04/best-love-hong-sisters-meta-lens-on-k-variety/ Best Love: Hong Sisters<U+2019> meta lens on k-variety] Dramabeans. April 22, 2011.</ref>

The mix of the main characters<U+2019> mismatched personalities with the necessity to maintain (or recoup in Ae-jung<U+2019>s case) public sentiment makes for great hijinks and drama, not to mention an interesting [[meta]] social commentary on the entertainment industry and the star-making and -breaking power of image.<ref name="dramabeans"/>

==Production==
Writers Hong Jung-eun and Hong Mi-ran, aka the "Hong Sisters,"<ref>[http://blue1004.wordpress.com/2011/06/27/interview-with-the-hong-sisters/ Interview with the Hong Sisters] 10Asia/Electric Ground. June 27, 2011.</ref> are known for their witty lines in dramas such as ''[[Delightful Girl Choon-Hyang]]'' (2005), ''[[My Girl (2005 TV series)|My Girl]]'' (2005),  ''[[Couple or Trouble|Fantasy Couple]]'' (2006), ''[[Hong Gil Dong (TV series)|Hong Gil Dong]]'' (2008) and ''[[You're Beautiful (TV series)|You<U+2019>re Beautiful]]'' (2009). Their most recent hit was the 2010 drama ''[[My Girlfriend is a Nine-Tailed Fox|My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho]]''. According to Director Park Hong-kyun (who previously helmed ''[[Queen Seondeok (TV series)|Queen Seondeok]]''), the Hong Sisters' adeptness at character comedy is how ''The Greatest Love'' hopes to differentiate itself from other trendy dramas airing on Korean television in Spring 2011. Though the drama draws from gossip people hear about celebrities, Cha said during the drama's press conference that he also wants to show a bright, healthy side of the entertainment scene in Korea. He admitted that entertainers do hide behind their image due to their job. "However, this drama will show they are just genuine people off-camera," Cha said. Yoon added that, "The script is very realistic, giving a fun sneak peek into what is going on behind the scenes."<ref name="koreatimes: article"/>

Cha has described his comedic acting as technical while his co-star Gong's is more naturalistic and reactive. They believe they struck a good balance between their two acting styles, which benefited the drama greatly.<ref>[http://10.asiae.co.kr/Articles/new_view.htm?sec=ent0&a_id=2011062711172155537 Interview: Actor Cha Seung-won] 10Asia.
