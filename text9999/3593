'''''The Secret of Monkey Island''''' is a {{vgy|1990}} [[Graphic adventure game#Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click graphic adventure game]] developed and published by [[Lucasfilm Games]]. It takes place in a fantastical version of the [[Caribbean]] during the age of [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]]. The player assumes the role of [[Guybrush Threepwood]], a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles. 

The game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee [[Ron Gilbert]], who designed it with [[Tim Schafer]] and [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]]. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the [[player character]]'s death impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] theme park ride. ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' was the fifth game built with the [[SCUMM]] engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.

Critics praised ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the [[Monkey Island series|''Monkey Island'' series]]. Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman also led the development of the sequel ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4070/back_in_the_water_the_monkey_.php?print=1|title=Back in the Water: The Monkey Island Interview|date=July 6, 2009|author=Chris Remo|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref> LucasArts released a remake of the original in 2009, which was also well received by the gaming press.

==Gameplay==
''The Secret of Monkey Island'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[adventure game]] played from a [[Third person (video games)|third-person perspective]]. Via a [[point-and-click]] interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game's world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer versions) such as "talk to" for communicating with characters and "pick up" for collecting items between commands and the world's objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game.<ref name="IGNFondMem">{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/909/909836p1.html|title=Fond Memories: The Secret of Monkey Island|first=Levi|last=Buchanan|date=September 12, 2008|accessdate=November 26, 2011|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a [[dialog tree]]; the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29696/Analysis_Smooth_Talk__The_Evolution_Of_Dialog_Trees.php|title=Analysis: Smooth Talk <U+2013> The Evolution Of Dialog Trees|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=November 26, 2011|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}</ref> The in-game action is frequently interrupted by [[cutscene]]s, [[Interactivity|non-interactive]] animated sequences that are used to provide information about character personalities and advance the plot.<ref>{{cite manual|author=Shepard, Mark|title=The Secret of Monkey Island Manual|page=5|publisher=[[Lucasfilm Games]]|date=October 1990}}</ref> Like other [[LucasArts adventure games]], ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' features a design philosophy that makes the player character's death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3167594|title=Game Over: Tension and the tentacle|first=Evan|last=Shamoon|date=April/May 2008|accessdate=November 26, 2011|publisher=[[Games for Windows: The Official Magazine]]}}</ref>

==Plot==
{{see also|World of Monkey Island}}

A youth named Guybrush Threepwood arrives on the fictional M<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e Island, with the desire to become a pirate. He seeks out the island's pirate leaders, who set him three trials that must be completed to become a pirate: winning a [[duel|sword duel]] against Carla, the island's resident swordmaster, [[treasure hunt|finding a buried treasure]], and stealing a valuable idol from the governor's mansion.<ref name="VG">{{cite video game|title=The Secret of Monkey Island|developer=[[Lucasfilm Games]]|platform=[[DOS]]|date=October 1990}}</ref> These quests take Guybrush throughout the island, where he hears of stories of the Ghost Pirate [[LeChuck]], who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious Monkey Island, an act that was meant to win the love of the governor [[Elaine Marley]].<ref name="VG" /> Guybrush meets several characters of interest, including a [[World of Monkey Island#Voodoo Lady|local voodoo priestess]], [[World of Monkey Island#Stan|Stan the Used Boat Salesman]], a prisoner named Otis, and Meathook, whose hands have been replaced by hooks.

Guybrush also encounters the governor and is instantly smitten, and she soon reciprocates. However, as he completes the tasks set for him, the island is raided by LeChuck and his undead crew, who abduct Elaine and then retreat to their secret hideout on Monkey Island.<ref name="VG" /> Guybrush takes it upon himself to rescue her, buying a ship and hiring Carla, Otis, and Meathook as crew before setting sail for the fabled island. When Guybrush reaches Monkey Island, he discovers a village of [[cannibal]]s in a dispute with [[World of Monkey Island#Herman Toothrot|Herman Toothrot]], a ragged [[castaway]] marooned there. He settles their quarrel, and then recovers a magical "voodoo root" from LeChuck's ship for the cannibals, who provide him with a [[Soda syphon|seltzer bottle]] of "voodoo root elixir" that can destroy ghosts.<ref name="VG" /> 

When Guybrush returns to LeChuck's ship with the elixir, he learns that LeChuck has returned to M<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e Island to marry Elaine at the church. He promptly returns to M<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e Island and gatecrashes the wedding, only to ruin Elaine's own plan for escape; in the process he loses the elixir.<ref name="VG" /> Now confronted with a furious LeChuck, Guybrush is savagely beaten by the ghost pirate in a fight ranging across the island. The fight eventually arrives at the island's ship emporium, where Guybrush finds a bottle of [[root beer]]. Substituting the beverage for the lost elixir, he sprays LeChuck, destroying the ghost pirate. With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush and Elaine enjoy a romantic moment, watching fireworks caused by LeChuck exploding.<ref name="VG" />

==Development==
===Origin and writing===
[[Ron Gilbert]] conceived the idea of a pirate adventure game in 1988, after completing ''[[Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders]]''.<ref name="RGInt">{{cite journal|date=December 5, 2008|title=The Making Of <U+2013> The Secret of Monkey Island|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=34|pages=58<U+2013>61|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> He first wrote story ideas about pirates while spending the weekend at a friend's house. Gilbert experimented with introductory paragraphs to find a satisfactory idea. His initial story featured unnamed villains that would eventually become LeChuck and Elaine; Guybrush was absent at this point.<ref name="RG-70">{{cite journal|magazine=Retro Gamer|publisher=Imagine Publishing|issue=70|title=Tales from Monkey Island|pages=29<U+2013>35| first=Ashley|last=Day|year=2009}}</ref> He pitched it to [[Lucasfilm Games]]'s staff as a series of short stories.<ref name="AdvInt">{{cite journal|year=Fall 1990|title=The Secret of Creating Monkey Island|journal=Lucasfilm Adventurer|volume= 1|issue= 1|publisher=[[Lucasfilm Games]]|url=http://www.scummbar.com/resources/articles/index.php?newssniffer=readarticle&article=1033}}</ref> Gilbert's idea was warmly received, but production was postponed because Lucasfilm Games assigned its designers, including Gilbert, to ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure]]''.<ref name="RGInt"/> Development of ''The Last Crusade'' was finished in 1989, which allowed Gilbert to begin production of ''The Secret of Monkey Island'', then known internally under the working title ''Mutiny on Monkey Island''.<ref name="RGInt"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/adventure/sesame-street-once-upon-a-monster/video/6313423|title=Video Game History Month: Tim Schafer|date=May 12, 2011|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:RonGilbert 2011 adjusted.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A brown haired man in a gray shirt looks into the camera while standing against black background.|[[Ron Gilbert]] led the game's development and conceived its plot (2011 photo).]]

Gilbert soon realised that it would be difficult to design the game by himself; he decided to join forces with [[Tim Schafer]] and [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]], both of whom he hired for Lucasfilm.<ref name="DThreads">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6153188/designer-threads-feat-ron-gilbert-6-30-06/p-2.html|title=Designer Threads Featuring Ron Gilbert <U+2013> Part 2|date=June 30, 2006|author=[[Greg Kasavin]]|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> The game's insult swordfighting mechanics were influenced by swashbuckling movies starring [[Errol Flynn]], which Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman often watched for inspiration. They noticed that pirates in those films often taunted their opponents instead of attacking them, which gave the designers the idea to base the game's duels on insults rather than combat.<ref name="RGInt"/><ref name="GG1">{{cite web|url=http://grumpygamer.com/8280380|title=Stuff and Things and Monkey Island|date=June 1, 2009|author=[[Ron Gilbert]]|publisher=[[Grumpy Gamer]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> Writer [[Orson Scott Card]] helped them write the insults during a visit to Lucasfilms' headquarters at [[Skywalker Ranch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefront.com/gaming-todays-exclusive-interview-with-author-orson-scott-card/|title=Gaming Today<U+2019>s Exclusive Interview with Author Orson Scott Card|first=Ron|last=Whittaker|date=June 15, 2007|publisher=[[GameFront]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> Many of Gilbert's original gameplay ideas were abandoned during the production process, although he stated that "most of that stuff was left out for a reason".<ref name="GG1"/>

The game's plot, as described by Dave Grossman: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a story about this young man who comes to an island in search of his life<U+2019>s dream. He<U+2019>s pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You<U+2019>re laughing, but there<U+2019>s actually something deeper going on as well.<U+201D><ref name="MSNBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31942046/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/aye-matey-beloved-pirate-games-set-sail-again/#.TqATupuBo8k|title=Aye matey, beloved pirate games set sail again|date=July 7, 2009|author=Winda Benedetti|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer's and Grossman's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman's was "very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor" and Schafer's was "just a little more in your face". In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required.<ref name="DThreads"/> Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer "were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together".<ref name="MSNBC"/> Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised.<ref name="RGInt"/> Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line "I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.<ref name="GG1"/> 

The game's world and characters were designed primarily by Gilbert. After having read [[Tim Powers]]' historical fantasy novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'', he decided to add [[paranormal]] themes to the game's plot. He also cited Powers' book as an influence on the characters, particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck. Inspiration for the game's ambiance came from Gilbert's favorite childhood amusement park ride, [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grumpygamer.com/6476640|title=On Stranger Tides|date=September 20, 2004|author=[[Ron Gilbert]]|publisher=[[Grumpy Gamer]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted "to step off the ride" and "talk to the people who lived in that world".<ref name="MSNBC"/> Near the final stages of the design work, Gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game's story. He considered this to be an important decision, as the player would need those seemingly minor characters in later parts of the game and would receive a chance to "really interact with them".<ref name="AdvInt"/> The developers included a character from ''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]'' (another 1990 LucasArts title). When approached for conversation, the character (Cobb) encourages the player to purchase ''Loom''.<ref name="WAT-Remake">{{cite web| url=http://blogs.watoday.com.au/digital-life/screenplay/2009/06/18/bygeorgeitsm.html|title=By George, it's Monkey magic|publisher =[[WAtoday]]|first=Jason|last=Hill|date=June 18, 2009|accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref>

===Creative and technical design===
Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman's primary goal was to create a simpler and more accessible gameplay model than those presented in previous Lucasfilm titles. Gilbert had conceived the main designs and puzzles before production began, which resulted in the bulk of the designers' work to flesh out his ideas.<ref name="RGInt"/> He was frustrated by the adventure games that [[Sierra On-Line]] was releasing at the time, and later said that "you died any time you did anything wrong". Gilbert considered such gameplay as "a cheap way out for the designer".<ref name="RGInt"/> He had previously applied his design ideas to the 1987 graphic adventure title ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'', but committed a number of mistakes during development, such as dead end situations that prevented the player from completing the game and poorly implemented triggers for cutscenes. Gilbert aimed to avoid such errors in ''The Secret of Monkey Island''.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro">{{cite journal|magazine=[[GamesTM]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|title=Behind the Scenes: ''Maniac Mansion'' + ''Day of the Tentacle''|year=2010 |issue=3|pages=22<U+2013>27|series=''The Ultimate Retro Companion''|issn=1448-2606|oclc=173412381}}</ref> The team decided to make it impossible for the player character to die, which focused gameplay primarily on world exploration.<ref name="RGInt"/>

''The Secret of Monkey Island'' was the fifth Lucasfilm Games project powered by the [[SCUMM]] engine, originally developed for ''Maniac Mansion''. The company had gradually modified the engine since its creation.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro">{{cite journal| magazine=[[GamesTM]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Hall of Fame: Guybrush Threepwood|year=2010|issue=3 |pages=188<U+2013>189| series=The Ultimate Retro Companion|issn=1448-2606|oclc=173412381}}</ref> For ''Maniac Mansion'', the developers [[Hard coding|hard coded]] verb commands in the SCUMM scripting language. These commands become more abstract in subsequent versions of the engine. The developers carried over the practice of referring to individual segments of the gameworld as "rooms", even though the areas in ''Monkey Island'' were outdoors.<ref name="GDC-Post">{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014732/Classic-Game-Postmortem-MANIAC|last=Gilbert|first=Ron|title=Classic Game Postmortem: ''Maniac Mansion''|publisher=[[Game Developers Conference]]|format=Flash Video|date=March 4, 2011|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> The game uses the same version of the engine used in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', with minor changes. A [[dialog tree]] was added, which facilitated conversation options and the sword-fighting puzzles.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> The developers removed the "What is" option (an input command that describes an on-screen object to the player) in favor of allowing the player to simply highlight the object with the mouse cursor.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/><ref name="AdvG">{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,808|title=Adventure Gamers's Top 20 <U+2013> #2: The Secret of Monkey Island|date=April 2, 2004|author=Evan Dickens|publisher=[[Adventure Gamers]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> The game's improved interface became the standard for the company's later titles. The game also introduced logical verb shortcuts, which could be performed with the mouse; for example, clicking on a character defaults to the "talk" action, the most obvious action in the situation.<ref name="AdvG"/> SCUMM's visuals were updated for the game<U+2014>the original [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] version had a 320x200&nbsp;pixel resolution rendered in 16&nbsp;colors.<ref name="GDC-Post"/><ref name="Spud-Stone-Monkey">{{cite web|url=http://spudvisionblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/stone-monkey-head.html|title=A Stone Monkey Head|date=February 22, 2011|publisher=Spudvision|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> According to artist [[Steve Purcell]], that became a major limitation for the art team; due to a low number of "ghastly" colors, they often chose bizarre tones for backgrounds.<ref name="Spud-Stone-Monkey"/> They chose black and white for Guybrush's outfit for the same reason.<ref name="GamesTm-Retro"/> The [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] version of the game later corrected these issues by implementing 256 color support, which allowed for more advanced background and character art.<ref name="AdvG"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/secret-of-monkey-island/screenshots/gameShotId,318376/|title=The Secret of Monkey Island <U+2013> Screenshot 26 of 40|date=August 13, 2008|publisher=[[MobyGames]]}}</ref>

LucasArts's game producer Craig Derrick and his team conceived the idea of the remake in 2008.<ref name="GSPInt"/> After researching the [[Monkey Island (series)|''Monkey Island'' series]]' history, they decided to make "something fresh and new while staying true to the original", which resulted in the idea of ''The Secret of Monkey Island'''s remake.<ref name="GSPInt"/> The developers tried to leave much of the original design unchanged. Any changes were intended to achieve the level of immersion desired for the original. To that end, they added details like a pirate ship or pirates talking in the background of scenes. While the team considered the SCUMM interface revolutionary at the time, LucasArts community manager Brooks Brown noted that it is incompatible with an analog stick, which most consoles use. The designers made the cursor contextual to the game objects as the primary interface. Brown had considered updating the reference to advertise ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' because ''Loom'' was not on the market at the time, but concluded that the game would not be the same if such changes were implemented.<ref name="WAT-Remake"/> Prior to the ''Special Edition'' release, however, LucasArts announced that ''Loom'', along with other games from its back catalog, would be made available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.lucasarts.com/company/release/news20090706.html|title=Back by Popular Demand, LOOM, The Dig, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and Star Wars Battlefront II Headline List of Games Soon to be Available via Direct Download!|publisher= LucasArts|date=July 6, 2009|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref> Brown stated that the decision to distribute the game online was because "digital downloads have finally gotten going".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/996/996023p1.html|title=Interview: Monkey Island <U+2013> The Return of Adventure Games|publisher=[[IGN]] Australia|date=June 17, 2009|author=Patrick Kolan|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

''The Secret of Monkey Island'' received positive reviews from critics. Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' praised the designers' attention to detail, and cited the game's humor as a high point. Although they believed that the game was too expensive, they summarized it as "a highly enjoyable graphic adventure replete with interesting puzzles, a fantastic [[Roland Sound Canvas|Roland]] soundtrack, superb [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] graphics, smooth-scrolling animation, and some of the funniest lines ever seen on your computer screen."<ref name=dragon /> Duncan MacDonald of ''[[Zero (video game magazine)|Zero]]'' praised the graphics and found the game "quite amusing". His favorite aspect was the fine-tuned difficulty level, which he believed was "just right". He ended his review, "At last an adventure game that's enjoyable rather than frustrating."<ref name=zero/> Paul Glancey of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' consider the game superior to Lucasfilm's earlier adventure titles, and wrote that, "Usually the entertainment you get from an adventure is derived solely from solving puzzles, but the hilarious characters and situations, and the movie-like presentation ... make playing this more like taking part in a comedy film, so it's much more enjoyable." He considered the puzzles to be "brilliantly conceived" and found the game's controls accessible. He summarized it as "utterly enthralling".<ref name=cvg/><ref name=amigapower/>

''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''{{'}}s Steve Cooke also found the controls convenient, and he praised the game's atmosphere. He wrote that, "in graphics and sound terms ... ''Monkey Island'', along with ''[[King's Quest V]]'', is currently at the head of the pack." However, he disliked the designers' running joke of placing "TM" after character and place names, which he thought detracted from the atmosphere. He singled out the game's writing, characters and plot structure as its best elements.<ref name= ace/> ''[[Amiga Power]]''{{'}}s Mark Ramshaw wrote, "With ''The Secret of Monkey Island'', the mouse-controlled, graphic-adventure comes of age." He lauded its comedic elements, which he believed were the highlight of the game. The reviewer also praised the control scheme, noting that it allows the player to "more or less forget about the specifics of what [they are] physically doing ... and lose [themselves] in the adventure instead." He noted that the game's plot and visual and aural presentation fit together to create a thick atmosphere, and finished, "Forget all those other milestone adventures (''[[Zork]]'', ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings: Game One|Lord of the Rings]]'' ''et al'') <U+2014> for sheer enjoyment and general all-round perfection, ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' creams 'em all in style."<ref name=amigapower /> The game, along with its sequel, was ranked the 19th best game of all time by ''Amiga Power''.<ref>Amiga Power magazine issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996</ref>

Writing for ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'', Paul Presley stated that "Lucasfilm appears to have taken all of the elements that worked in its previous releases and, not only incorporated them into this tale of scurvy swashbuckling, but even improved on them in the process!" Like the other reviewers, he praised its controls. He also lauded its "hilarious storyline, strong characters and ... intriguing setting", but complained about graphical slowdowns.<ref name=theone/> Nick Clarkson of ''[[Amiga Computing]]'' cited the game's graphics as "flawless", noting that "the characters are superbly animated and the backdrops simply ooze atmosphere." He highly praised its sound effects and music, and believed that its controls "couldn't be simpler".<ref name=amigacomputing /> The staff of ''[[Amiga Action]]'' wrote that the "attention to detail and the finely tuned gameplay cannot be faulted." They called the graphics "stunning throughout", and believed that, when they were combined with the "excellent Caribbean tunes", the result is a game filled with "character and atmosphere." They ended by stating that "there is absolutely no excuse for not owning this game."<ref name=amigaaction/>

''The Secret of Monkey Island'' has featured regularly in lists of "top" games, such as ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'s'' Hall of Fame<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=6&cId=3139081#54|title=CGW's Hall of Fame|publisher=[[1UP.com]]}}</ref> and [[IGN]]'s Video Game Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.ign.com/halloffame/secret-of-monkey-island.html|title=IGN Videogame Hall Of Fame: The Secret of Monkey Island|publisher=IGN|year=2007|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' ranked it as the 19th best game of all time, "writing "Who could ever forget the insult-driven duel system or the identity of the mysterious Swordmaster?".<ref>''CGW'' 148: 150 Best Games of All Time</ref> In 2010, IGN ranked the Xbox Live Arcade version as the 20th best title of all time for that platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/112/1120887p1.html|title=The Top 25 Xbox Live Arcade Games|publisher =[[IGN]]|date=16 September 2010|accessdate=2010-09-16 }}</ref> In 2009, IGN named ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' one of the ten best [[LucasArts adventure games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/104/1046144p1.html|title=Top 10 LucasArts Adventure Games|publisher=IGN|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref>

Like the original release, ''The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition'' received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of ''[[GamePro]]'' praised its updated audio, and said that the new graphics "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, "''The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition'' is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money."<ref name=gamepro/> Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]] wrote, "Almost 20 years after its release, [''The Secret of Monkey Island''] remains a blast to play." He called the new graphics "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that "few games are this funny."<ref name=ign2 /> Justin Calvert of [[GameSpot]] noted that "the Special Edition looks much better and is the only way to play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas the original game's interface is less clunky." However, he wrote that "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well.<ref name=gamespot2>{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=Justin|date=April 23, 2010|title=''The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition'' Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/the-secret-of-monkey-island-special-edition/reviews/the-secret-of-monkey-island-special-edition-review-6260007|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=December 15, 2011 }}</ref> [[Eurogamer]]'s Dan Whitehead wrote, "Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was "rather less intuitive" than the old one. He finished by stating that "few games can stand the test of time with such confidence".<ref name=eurogamer>{{cite web|last=Whitehead|first=Dan|date=July 15, 2009|title=''Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition'' Review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-secret-of-monkey-island-special-edition-review|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref>

Elements of the game have appeared elsewhere in popular culture. In 2005, student Chris Heady wrote, directed, and produced a live stage version of ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' at [[Hammond High School (Columbia, Maryland)|Hammond High School]] in Columbia, Maryland. LucasArts licensed the play for a year, but stipulated that the script be used for nonprofit purposes and could not be distributed outside cast and crew.<ref name="BaltSun">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-04-29/news/0504290101_1_hammond-high-heady-lucasarts|title=Pirates and a villain will roam the stage|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]| date=April 29, 2005|first=Dana|last=Klosner-Wehner|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref> The adaptation resulted in [[Guinness World Records]] awarding the game a record for the "first graphic adventure to become a stage play".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-6000/first-graphic-adventure-to-become-a-stage-play/|title=First graphic adventure to become a stage play|publisher=[[Jim Pattison Group]]|work=Guinness World Records|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>
