'''''Year Zero''''' is the sixth studio album by [[United States|American]] [[industrial rock]] act [[Nine Inch Nails]], released on [[April 16]], [[2007]] by [[Interscope Records]]. Frontman [[Trent Reznor]] wrote the album's music and lyrics while touring in support of the group's previous release, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). In contrast to the introverted style of songwriting Reznor used on previous records, ''Year Zero'' is a [[concept album]] that criticizes contemporary policies of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] by presenting a [[dystopia]]n vision of  the year 2022. The album is part of a larger ''Year Zero'' project which includes a [[Year Zero Remixed|remix album]], an [[alternate reality game]], and a potential television or film project. The [[Year Zero (game)|''Year Zero'' alternate reality game]] expanded upon the album's fictional storyline by using media such as websites, pre-recorded phone messages, and murals.

''Year Zero'' received generally positive reviews, many of which were also favorable toward the accompanying alternate reality game.  The album produced two singles, "[[Survivalism (song)|Survivalism]]" and "[[Capital G]]", the latter released as a promotional single. Disputes arose between Reznor and [[Universal Music Group]], parent company of Interscope Records, over the overseas pricing of the album. Following the release of ''Year Zero'', Nine Inch Nails fulfilled its Interscope contract, and the band proceeded as an independent act without any label representation.

==Recording==
In a 2005 interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write material for a new release while on tour to promote the group's fifth album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Reznor reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006.<ref>{{cite web

Reznor said, "I didn't have guitars around because it was too much hassle&nbsp;... It was another creative limitation&nbsp;... If I were in my studio, I would have done things the way I normally do them.  But not having the ability to do that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do."<ref name="Frustration and Fury">{{cite web

By the end of the tour, Reznor began work on the album's lyrical concepts, attempting to break away from his typically introspective approach. Reznor drew inspiration from his concern at the state of affairs in the United States and at what he envisioned as the country's political, spiritual, and social direction.<ref name="Best Buy bonus interview">{{cite video

In an interview with ''Kerrang!'' magazine, Reznor hinted that the album was "part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on."<ref name="Kerrang" />  In February 2007 fans discovered that a new Nine Inch Nails tour t-shirt contained highlighted letters that spelled out the words "I am trying to believe".<ref name="Web Trail" /> This phrase was registered as a [[Websites and phone numbers in the Year Zero alternate reality game#I am Trying to Believe|website URL]], and soon several related websites were also discovered in the [[IP address|IP range]], all describing a dystopian vision of the fictional "[[Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game|year 0000]]".<ref name="Web Trail" />  It was later reported that [[42 Entertainment]] had created these websites to promote ''Year Zero'' as part of [[Year Zero (alternate reality game)|an alternate reality game]].<ref name="42entertainment">{{cite web

The ''Year Zero'' story takes place in the United States in the year 2022; or "Year 0" according to the American government, being the year that America was reborn.  The United States has suffered several major terrorist attacks, and in response the government has seized absolute control on the country and reverted to a Christian [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[theocracy]].  The government maintains control of the populace through institutions such as the [[Characters and organizations in the Year Zero alternate reality game#Bureau of Morality|Bureau of Morality]] and the [[Characters and organizations in the Year Zero alternate reality game#First Evangelical Church of Plano|First Evangelical Church of Plano]], as well as increased surveillance and the secret drugging of tap water with a mild sedative.  In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authoritarian government.  The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn the American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place.<ref name="Cooler Than Lost">{{cite web

The ''Year Zero'' game consisted of series of websites, phone numbers, e-mails, videos, [[MP3]]s, murals, and other media that expanded upon the fictional storyline of the album.  Each new piece of media contained various hints and clues to discover the next, relying on fan participation to discover each new facet of the expanding game.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the fan involvement in this promotion as the "marketing team's dream".<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite web

Between tour legs Nine Inch Nails gave a performance as part of the ''Year Zero'' game. A small group of fans received fictional in-game telephone-calls that invited them to a "resistance meeting" in a Los Angeles parking lot.

Even though the fictional story begins in January 2007, the [[Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game|timeline]] of the album and alternate reality game mentions historical events, such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] and the [[Iraq War]].

[[Image:Nine inch nails year zero cd face.jpg|thumb|The two states of the ''Year Zero'' disc: black when cooled, white when heated]]
All of the artwork for ''Year Zero'' was created by [[Rob Sheridan]], acting [[art director]] for Nine Inch Nails, who is also credited for artwork on ''With Teeth'', among other Nine Inch Nails releases since 2000.  The album features a thermo-chrome heat-sensitive CD face which appears black when first opened, but reveals a black binary code on a white background when heat is generated from the album being played.<ref name="Reznor nails big">{{cite web
