== History ==
Nishio Castle dates to the [[Muromachi period]] with a fortification called Saijo- j<U+014D> was built by [[Ashikaga Yoshiuji]] in around 1221. The territory came under the control of the [[Tokugawa clan]] in the [[Sengoku period]], and by order of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], [[Sakai Shigetada]] rebuilt the castle in 1585 with moats, stone walls, several ''[[yagura]]'', gates and a ''[[donjon]]''. The castle was expanded further under  [[Tanaka Yoshimasa]], rulers of [[Sunpu Castle]] under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].

Following the establlishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the castle became the headquarters of [[Nishio Domain]], which changed hands many times during the [[Edo period]].

The castle was dismantled in 1872, following the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The current structures include a large "yagura" and gate, reconstructed in 1996 to boost local tourism along with a local history museum.
