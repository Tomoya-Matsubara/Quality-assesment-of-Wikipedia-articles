The '''West Los Angeles Transit Center''' is a terminal located right underneath the [[Interstate 10|I-10]] freeway on [[Washington Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Washington Boulevard]] and [[Fairfax Avenue]].  Many bus routes run by the [[Metro Local]] and [[Culver CityBus]] begin and terminate at this terminal.  Buses traveling on La Cienega Blvd., Fairfax Ave., the I-10 freeway, Adams Blvd., Jefferson Blvd., and to/from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] all enter/leave the West LA Transit Center.   Ridership levels are fairly high during rush hours, but service slows down during the evening/late night.
