[[Image:SynapseIllustration.png|thumb|350px|Illustration of the major elements in a prototypical '''synapse'''. Synapses allow [[neuron|nerve cells]] to communicate with one another through [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s, converting [[action potential|electrical impulses]] into [[neurotransmitter|chemical]] signals.]]

'''Chemical synapses''' are specialized junctions through which cells of the [[nervous system]] signal to one another and to non-neuronal cells such as [[muscle]]s or [[gland]]s. A chemical synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is called a [[neuromuscular junction]].

Chemical synapses allow the [[neuron]]s of the [[central nervous system]] to form interconnected neural circuits.  They are thus crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They also provide the means through which the nervous system connects to and controls the other systems of the body.

The [[human brain]] contains a huge number of chemical synapses, with young children having about 1,000 trillion. This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates for an adult vary from 100 to 500 trillion synapses.

The word "synapse" comes from "synaptein" which Sir [[Charles Scott Sherrington]] and his colleagues coined from the Greek "syn-" meaning "together" and "haptein" meaning "to clasp". Chemical synapses are not the only type of biological synapse: [[electrical synapse|electrical]] and [[immunological synapse]]s exist as well. Without a qualifier, however, "synapse" by itself most commonly refers to a chemical synapse.

==Anatomy==
At a prototypical chemical synapse, such as those found at [[dendritic spine]]s, a mushroom-shaped bud projects from each of two cells  and the caps of these buds press flat against one another.  At this interface, the [[biological membrane|membrane]]s of the two cells flank each other across a slender gap, the narrowness of which enables signalling molecules known as [[neurotransmitter]]s to pass rapidly from one cell to the other by [[diffusion]]. This gap, which is about 20 nm wide, is known as the '''synaptic cleft'''.

Such synapses are asymmetric both in structure and in how they operate. Only the so-called '''pre-synaptic''' neuron secretes the neurotransmitter, which binds to [[transmembrane receptor|receptor]]s facing into the synapse from the '''post-synaptic''' cell. The pre-synaptic nerve terminal (also called the ''synaptic button'' or ''bouton'') generally buds from the tip of an [[axon]], while the post-synaptic target surface typically appears on a [[dendrite]], a cell body, or another part of a cell. The parts of synapses where neurotransmitter is released are called the '''active zones'''. At active zones the membranes of the two adjacent cells are held in close contact by [[cell adhesion]] proteins. Immediately behind the post-synaptic membrane is an elaborate complex of interlinked proteins called the [[postsynaptic density]].  Proteins in the postsynaptic density serve myriad roles, from anchoring and trafficking neurotransmitter [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] into the plasma membrane, to anchoring various proteins which modulate the activity of the receptors. The postsynaptic cell need not be a neuron, and can also be [[gland]] or [[muscle]] cells.

== Signaling across chemical synapses ==
The release of neurotransmitter is triggered by the arrival of a nerve impulse (or [[action potential]]) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion, also known as [[exocytosis]]: Within the pre-synaptic nerve terminal, [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s containing neurotransmitter sit "docked" and ready at the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of [[second messenger|calcium ions]] through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective [[ion channel]]s. Calcium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic-membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft.  Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as [[SNARE (protein)|SNAREs]]. The membrane added by this fusion is later retrieved by [[endocytosis]] and [[Endocytic cycle|recycled]] for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.
Receptors on the opposite side of the synaptic gap bind neurotransmitter molecules and respond by opening nearby ion channels in the post-synaptic cell membrane, causing ions to rush in or out and changing the local [[transmembrane potential]] of the cell. The resulting change in voltage is called a [[postsynaptic potential]]. In general, the result is ''excitatory'', in the case of [[Depolarization|depolarizing]] currents, or ''inhibitory'' in the case of [[Hyperpolarization|hyperpolarizing]] currents.  Whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory depends on what type(s) of ion channel conduct the post-synaptic current display(s), which in turn is a function of the type of receptors and neurotransmitter employed at the synapse.

== Modulation of synaptic transmission ==
Following fusion of the synaptic vesicles and release of transmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter is rapidly cleared from the space for recycling by specialized membrane proteins in the pre-synaptic or post-synaptic membrane.  This "[[reuptake|re-uptake]]" prevents "[[desensitization]]" of the post-synaptic receptors and ensures that succeeding action potentials will elicit the same size [[Postsynaptic potential|post-synaptic potential ("PSP")]]. The necessity of re-uptake and the phenomenon of desensitization in receptors and ion channels means that the strength of a synapse may in effect diminish as a train of action potentials arrive in rapid succession--a phenomenon that gives rise to the so-called '''frequency dependence''' of synapses. The nervous system exploits this property for computational purposes, and can tune its synapses through such means as [[phosphorylation]] of the proteins involved. The size, number and replenishment rate of vesicles also are subject to regulation, as are many other elements of synaptic transmission. For example, a class of drugs known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s affect certain synapses by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]].  In contrast, one important excitatory neurotransmitter, [[acetylcholine]], does not undergo re-uptake, but instead is removed from the synapse by the action of the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]].

== Integration of synaptic inputs ==
Generally, if an excitatory synapse is strong, an [[action potential]] in the pre-synaptic neuron will trigger another in the post-synaptic cell; whereas at a weak synapse the [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory post-synaptic potential ("EPSP")]] will not reach the [[action potential|threshold]] for action potential initiation. In the brain, however, each neuron typically forms synapses with many others, and likewise each receives synaptic inputs from many others. When action potentials fire simultaneously in several neurons that weakly synapse on a single cell, they may initiate an impulse in that cell even though the synapses are weak. This process is known as '''summation'''.  On the other hand, a pre-synaptic neuron releasing an inhibitory neurotransmitter such as [[GABA]] can cause [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]] in the post-synaptic neuron, decreasing its excitability and therefore decreasing the neuron's likelihood to fire an action potential.  In this way the output of a neuron may depend on the input of many others, each of which may have a different degree of influence, depending on the strength of its synapse with that neuron. [[John Carew Eccles]] performed some of the important early experiments on synaptic integration, for which he received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1963. Complex input/output relationships form the basis of [[transistor]]-based computations in [[computer]]s, and are thought to figure similarly in neural circuits.

== Synaptic strength ==
The strength of a synapse is defined by the change in transmembrane potential resulting from activation of the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. This change in voltage is known as a post-synaptic potential, and is a direct result of ionic [[Current (electricity)|currents]] flowing through the post-synaptic receptor-channels. Changes in synaptic strength can be short-term and without permanent structural changes in the neurons themselves, lasting seconds to minutes - or long-term ([[long-term potentiation]], or LTP), in which repeated or continuous synaptic activation can result in [[second messenger]] molecules  initiating [[protein synthesis]] in the neuron's [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], resulting in alteration of the structure of the synapse itself.  Learning and memory are believed to result from long-term changes in synaptic strength, via a mechanism known as [[synaptic plasticity]].

==Relationship to electrical synapses==
{{main|electrical synapse}}
An '''electrical synapse''' is a mechanical and electrically [[conductor (material)|conductive]] link between two abutting [[neuron]]s that is formed at a narrow gap between the pre- and postsynaptic [[cell (biology)|cell]]s known as a [[gap junction]].  At gap junctions, cells approach within about 3.5 nm of each other (Kandel et al., 2000, p. 179), a much shorter distance than the 20 to 40 nm distance that separates cells at chemical synapses (Hormuzdi et al., 2004). As opposed to chemical synapses, the postsynaptic potential in electrical synapses is not caused by the opening of ion channels by chemical transmitters, but by direct electrical coupling between both neurons.  Electrical synapses are therefore faster and more reliable than chemical synapses.  Electrical synapses are found throughout the nervous system, yet are less common than chemical synapses.
