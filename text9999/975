'''Slieve Gallion''' (1904&ndash;1926) was a British [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse and [[Horse breeding#Terminology|sire]]. In a career that lasted from May 1906 to June 1907 he ran eight times and won six races. He was one of the leading British two-year-olds of 1906 when his wins included the [[Champagne Stakes]] at [[Doncaster Racecourse|Doncaster]]. The following spring he became a [[British Classic Races|Classic]] winner by taking the [[2000 Guineas]] but finished third when favourite for the [[Epsom Derby]]. After winning his only subsequent race he was sold and exported to stand as a stallion in Hungary.

==Background==
Slieve Gallion's colour was controversial: he was officially described as a black horse,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/33081893?searchTerm=%22slieve%20gallion%22&searchLimits=exactPhrase=slieve+gallion |anyWords |notWords |l-textSearchScope=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |fromdd=01 |frommm=09 |fromyyyy=1906 |todd=31 |tomm=10 |toyyyy=1906 |l-word=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |sortby |title=SPORTING NOTES |publisher=Kalgoorlie Western Argus |date=30 Oct 1906 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> although his portrait suggests that he was a dark-coated [[bay (horse)|bay]],<ref name="TBH">{{cite web|author=Patricia Erigero |url=http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/Gallinule.html#SlieveGallion |title=SlieveGallion |publisher=Thoroughbred Heritage |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> and some argued that he was an unusually dark chestnut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OW19071211.2.253.7&srpos=1&e=01-12-1907-31-12-1907--10--1----2Slieve+Gallion-- |title=THE COLOUR QUESTION |publisher=Otago Witness |date=11 December 1907 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> He was bred in England by the Irish breeder Henry Greer, who owned the colt during his racing career. Greer named the colt after a [[Slieve Gallion|mountain]] in [[County Londonderry]]. He was sired by Greer's stallion Gallinule, a moderate racehorse who became a highly successful sire of winners, being the [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]] on two occasions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Patricia Erigero Thoroughbred Heritage |url=http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/Gallinule.html |title=Gallinule |publisher=Thoroughbred Heritage |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> Greer sent the colt to be trained by Sam Darling at [[Beckhampton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=896 |title=Horseracing History Online - Person Profile : Samuel Darling |publisher=Horseracinghistory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref>

==Racing career==
===1906: two-year-old season===
Slieve Gallion began his racing career at [[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]] in May where he won the Cobham Plate. He was immediately moved up in class and sent to [[Royal Ascot]] for the New Stakes, the race now known as the [[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|Norfolk Stakes]]. He won the race "very easily"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS19060802.2.7&srpos=1&e=01-08-1906-31-09-1906--10--1----0Slieve+Gallion-- |title=SPORTING NEWS |publisher=Star |date=2 August 1906 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> to establish himself as one on the season's leading two-year-olds. A much anticipated meeting between Slieve Gallion and the year's other leading colt, Traquair, in the [[July Stakes]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] did not come to pass whe Greer's horse was withdrawn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/25685038?searchTerm=%22slieve%20gallion%22&searchLimits=exactPhrase=slieve+gallion |anyWords |notWords |l-textSearchScope=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |fromdd=01 |frommm=07 |fromyyyy=1906 |todd=31 |tomm=08 |toyyyy=1906 |l-word=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |sortby |title=SPORTING NEWS.

After a three month break, Slieve Gallion returned to the racecourse for the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster. He won. On his final start of the season he ran in one of the year's most important two-year-old races, the [[Middle Park Stakes]] at Newmarket Racecourse. He was made favourite at odds of 1/4 in a field of five runners<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OW19061128.2.145&srpos=5&e=01-10-1906-31-11-1906--10--1----0Slieve+Gallion-- |title=IN A NUTSHELL |publisher=Otago Witness |date=28 November 1906 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> but was beaten after a "long and desperate struggle"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OW19061212.2.162.5&srpos=4&e=01-12-1906-31-12-1906--10--1----0Slieve+Gallion-- |title=IN A NUTSHELL |publisher=Otago Witness |date=12 December 1906 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> by [[Eustace Loder]]'s colt Galvani, with Traquair third. One xplanation for his half-length defeat was that he was below his best form having suffered from dental problems in the build-up to the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/68877031?searchTerm=%22slieve%20gallion%22&searchLimits=exactPhrase=slieve+gallion |anyWords |notWords |l-textSearchScope=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |fromdd=01 |frommm=11 |fromyyyy=1906 |todd=31 |tomm=12 |toyyyy=1906 |l-word=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |sortby |title=THE TURF |publisher=The Capricornian |date=24 Nov 1906 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> Although he had been beaten in his most important test, Slieve Gallion was widely regarded as the fastest two-year-old of the season, despite his "tearaway"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS19061205.2.5&srpos=2&e=01-12-1906-31-12-1906--10--1----0Slieve+Gallion-- |title=SPORTING NEWS |publisher=Star |date=5 December 1906 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> racing style and tendency to carry his head at a high, awkward angle. Late in the season it was reported that Greer had turned down an offer of 18,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for his colt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=TS19061116.2.7&srpos=3&e=01-10-1906-31-11-1906--10--1----0Slieve+Gallion-- |title=SPORTING NOTES |publisher=Star |date=16 November 1906 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref>

===1907: three-year-old season===
Slieve Galion began his three-year-old season by winning the Craven Stakes at Newmarket in April. In the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance two weeks later he started at [[Fractional odds|odds of 4/11]] against nine opponents. Ridden by Billy Higgs, he took an early lead and after being briefly challenged by Bezonian drew clear "in splendid style" to win easily by three lengths.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OW19070619.2.295&srpos=1&e=01-05-1907-31-08-1907--10-OW-1----2Slieve+Gallion-- |title=RACING IS ENGLAND |publisher=Otago Witness |date=19 June 1907 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref>

At [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom]] on 5 June he was made 8/13 favourite for the one and a half mile Derby in a field of nine runners. Confidence was high, with one prominent correspondent claiming that Slieve Gallion only had to "escape acceident" to win the Classic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=WC19070712.2.55.2&srpos=10&e=01-07-1907-31-07-1907--10--1----2Slieve+Gallion-- |title=NOTES BY " MULTIFORM." |publisher=Wanganui Chronicle |date=12 July 1907 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> Despite stamina not being considered one of Slieve Gallion's strengths,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OW19070220.2.180&srpos=3&e=01-01-1907-31-02-1907--10--1----2Slieve+Gallion-- |title=IN A NUTSHELL |publisher=Otago Witness |date=20 February 1907 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> Higgs rode the colt positively, sending him to the front after half a mile. He continued to lead into the straight, but two furlongs from the finish he began to struggle and was overtaken by the Irish colt [[Orby (horse)|Orby]]. Slieve Gallion hung badly to the right<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OW19070612.2.263.16&srpos=3&e=01-05-1907-31-08-1907--10-OW-1----2Slieve+Gallion-- |title=RACING IN ENGLAND |publisher=Otago Witness |date=12 June 1907 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> as he tired and finished third, beaten two lengths and half a length by Orby and [[Wool Winder]].

Two weeks after his defeat at Epsom, Sleve Gallion returned to the one mile distance for the St James's Palace Stakes at [[Royal Ascot]] which he won from two opponents at odds of 1/20.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/25708196?searchTerm=%22Slieve%20Gallion%22&searchLimits=exactPhrase=Slieve+Gallion |anyWords |notWords |l-textSearchScope=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |fromdd=01 |frommm=06 |fromyyyy=1907 |todd=31 |tomm=07 |toyyyy=1907 |l-word=*ignore*%7C*ignore* |sortby |title=SPORTING NEWS.

==Stud career==
Slieve Gallion was exported by his new owner to stand as a stallion in [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OSWCC19071224.2.24&srpos=2&e=01-12-1907-31-12-1907--10--1----2Slieve+Gallion-- |title=SPORTING INTELLIGENCE |publisher=Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle |date=24 December 1907 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> He made little impact as a sire of flat racers, but his progeny proved highly successful as [[Steeplechase|steeplechasers]]. He was euthanized at the Kisber Stud in 1926.<ref name="TBH"/>
