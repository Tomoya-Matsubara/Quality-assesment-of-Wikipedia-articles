<b>HMS ''Tudor''</b> was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[submarine]] of the third group of the [[British T class submarine|''T'' class]]. She was built as ''P326'' at Devonport Dockyard, and launched on [[23 September]] [[1942]].  So far she has been the only ship of the [[Royal Navy]] to bear the name ''Tudor'', after the [[Tudor period]] or [[Tudor dynasty]].

==Service==

''Tudor'' served in the Far East for much of her wartime career, where she sank five Japanese sailing vessels, four Japanese coasters, and another Japanese vessel, as well as an unidentified sailing vessel north of [[Sumatra]].

She survived the war and continued in service with the Navy, finally being sold to be broken up for scrap on [[1 July]] [[1963]] and scrapped at Faslane.<ref>[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3515.html HMS Tudor], Uboot.net</ref>
