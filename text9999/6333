'''American Airlines Flight 11''' was a scheduled [[United States|U.S.]] domestic passenger flight from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], to [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. It was hijacked by five men and deliberately crashed into the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] as part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]]. Fifteen minutes into the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people, forcefully breached the cockpit, and overpowered the pilot and first officer.

Air traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew stopped responding to them. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Atta mistakenly transmitted announcements to air traffic control. On board, two flight attendants contacted [[American Airlines]], and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.  

The aircraft crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46&nbsp;a.m.; the impact killed all 92&nbsp;people aboard, including the hijackers. Many people in the streets witnessed the collision, and [[Jules and Gedeon Naudet|Jules Naudet]] captured the impact on video. News agencies began to report on the incident soon after and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse, which resulted in thousands of additional casualties. During the [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11, 2001 attacks|recovery effort]] at the [[World Trade Center site]], workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight&nbsp;11 victims, but many other body fragments could not be identified.

The [[9/11 Commission]] estimated that the hijacking began at 08:14, when the pilots stopped responding to requests from the Boston [[Air traffic control|Air Traffic Control]] center (BATC).<ref name="ch1" /> At 08:13:29, as the aircraft was passing {{convert|26000|ft|m}} over central Massachusetts, the pilots responded to a request from BATC to make a 20-degree turn to the right. At 08:13:47, BATC told the pilots to ascend to a cruising altitude of {{convert|35000|ft|m}} but got no response.<ref name="ntsb" /> At 08:16, the aircraft leveled off at {{convert|29000|ft|m}}<ref name="ntsb" /> and shortly thereafter deviated from its scheduled path. BATC made multiple attempts to talk to Flight&nbsp;11 but got no reply,<ref name="ch1"/> and at 08:21, the flight stopped transmitting its Mode-C [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] signal.<ref name="ntsb"/>

According to flight attendants Madeline Sweeney and Betty Ong, who contacted American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed the throat of passenger [[Daniel M.

Witnesses who saw the plane fly at low altitude over Manhattan before the crash thought  the aircraft was in distress. [[Port Authority Police Department|Port Authority]] police officer William Ross stated, "I was trying to observe the plane, as closely as I could for smoke, fire or any type of vapor trail. There was none. The landing gear was up and the doors that house the gear closed. The plane, was, as I stated, traveling south and was moving at a high rate of speed. It was flying level and straight.

We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off and go into the Hudson. But he just rose a little bit, his altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center.

News organizations at first reported an explosion or incident at the World Trade Center. [[CNN]] broke into a commercial at 08:49 with the headline that read "World Trade Center Disaster". [[Carol Lin]], who was the first anchor to break the news of the attacks, said:

<blockquote>Yeah. This just in. You are looking at obviously a very [[:Image:CNN Breaking News 911.jpg|disturbing live shot]] there. That is the World Trade Center, and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center.

Later, in an on-air phone call from his office at the CNN New York bureau, CNN vice-president of finance Sean Murtagh reported that a large passenger commercial jet had hit the World Trade Center.<ref name="FirstReport" /> Eventually, all other TV networks interrupted regular broadcasting with news of the crash. President [[George W. Bush]] was arriving at [[Emma E. Booker Elementary School]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]] when aides informed him of the crash. The president remarked, "This is pilot error. It's unbelievable that somebody would do this.

After the crash, the North Tower burned and [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapsed]].

After the attacks, the [[flight number]] for flights on the same route at the same takeoff time was changed to American Airlines Flight&nbsp;25, and a [[Boeing 757]] was used instead of a [[Boeing 767]].
