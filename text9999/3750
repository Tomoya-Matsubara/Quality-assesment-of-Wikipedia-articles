The '''Bristol Aeroplane Company''' (formerly British and Colonial Aeroplane Company) was a major [[United Kingdom|British]] aviation company. In [[1956 in aviation|1956]] its major operations were split into '''Bristol Aircraft''' and '''Bristol Aero Engines'''. In 1959, Bristol Aircraft merged  with several major British aircraft companies to form the '''[[British Aircraft Corporation]]''' (BAC). At the same time, Bristol Aero Engines merged with [[Armstrong Siddeley]] to form [[Bristol Siddeley]]. 

BAC went on to become a founding component of the nationalised [[British Aerospace]], now [[BAE Systems]]. Bristol Siddeley was purchased by [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] in 1966, who continued to develop and market Bristol-designed engines. The BAC / Bristol works were located in [[Filton]], about 4 miles north of [[Bristol]] city centre. BAE Systems still operate from Filton.

==History==
[[Image:Bristolboxkite.JPG|thumb|1963 Replica of the Bristol Boxkite, now hanging in the [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]].]]
The '''British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, Limited''' was founded in [[1910 in aviation|1910]] by [[George White (businessman)|Sir George White]] - the owner of [[Bristol Tramways]] - to manufacture aircraft at Filton in Bristol. Unlike most aviation companies at the time, which were started by enthusiasts with little financial backing or business organization, British and Colonial was from its outset well funded and run by experienced businessmen. The Company's initial venture was a licensed and improved version of the [[Gabriel Voisin|Voisin]] brothers' Zodiac 'Boxkite' biplane, which was shown at the Aero Show at Olympia in March [[1910 in aviation|1910]]. Unfortunately the Zodiac was extremely underpowered, and never flew.

Production of Bristol's first successful design, the [[Bristol Boxkite]], started in a former tramway shed at Filton in June 1910. A month later the Company also formed a flying school, with premises at [[Brooklands]], near London, and [[Larkhill]] on [[Salisbury Plain]].  This flying school was regarded as one the best in the world, between 1910 and 1914.  By 1914, 308 of the 664 [[Royal Aero Club]] certificates issued had been gained at the Company's schools.

===First World War===
The Company expanded rapidly during this time, reaching a payroll of 200 by the outbreak of the [[First World War]].  The chief designer (styled ''chef technique'') from January 1912 until October 1914 was the [[Romania|Romanian]] engineer [[Henri Coand<U+0103>]]. Coand<U+0103> was succeeded by [[Frank Barnwell]], who was to become one of the world's foremost aeronautical engineers.  One of Barnwell's first designs, the [[Bristol Scout]], was one of the very first fighter aircraft to enter British service.  Later in the war came the mass-produced two-seat [[Bristol Fighter]], which was one of the backbones of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), later the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).

===Inter-war years===
By the end of the war, the Company employed over 3000, at its production works at Filton and [[Brislington]].  Its products had always been referred to by the name 'Bristol' and this was formalized in 1920, when British and Colonial was [[liquidation|liquidated]] and its assets became the '''Bristol Aeroplane Company, Limited'''. At this time the Company bought the failing [[Cosmos Engineering|Cosmos Engineering Company]], also of Bristol, to form the nucleus of its new aero-engine operations; the '''Bristol Engine Company'''.

A major product during the interwar years was the [[Bristol Bulldog]] fighter, which formed the mainstay of RAF fighters between 1918 and 1935. During this time Bristol was noted for its policy of 'all-steel' airframes, preferring steel to the light alloys generally used in aircraft construction.  Bristol airframes were built up from  high-tensile strip steel rolled into section, and were powered exclusively by Bristol's own engines.

On 15 June [[1935 in aviation|1935]] the Bristol Aeroplane Company became a [[public limited liability company]]. By this time the Company had a payroll of 4200, mostly in the engine factory, and was well positioned to take advantage of the huge re-armament ordered by the British Government in May of that year.  Bristol's most important contribution to the expansion of the RAF at this time was the [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] light bomber.  In August [[1938 in aviation|1938]] Frank Barnwell was killed in a light plane crash, and was succeeded as Chief Designer by [[Leslie Frise]]. By the time war broke out in [[1939 in aviation|1939]] the Bristol works at Filton were the largest single aircraft manufacturing unit in the world, with a floor area of nearly 25 [[hectare]]s (2,691,000 square feet).

===Second World War===
During the [[Second World War]] Bristol's most important aircraft was the [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] heavy two-seat multirole aircraft; a long-range fighter, [[night fighter]], [[ground attack aircraft]] and [[torpedo bomber]]. It was used extensively by the RAF and Commonwealth air forces, and by the [[USAAF]].  The Beaufighter was derived from the earlier [[Bristol Beaufort|Beaufort]] torpedo bomber, itself a derivative of the Blenheim.

In [[1940 in aviation|1940]] a [[shadow factory]] had been set up at [[Weston-super-Mare]] for the production of Beaufighters.

The companies war time headquarters was in the [[Royal West of England Academy]].

===Post-war===
When the war ended Bristol set up a separate helicopter division in the Weston-super-Mare factory, under helicopter pioneer [[Raoul Hafner]].  The Helicopter Division of Bristol was taken over by [[Westland]] in [[1960 in aviation|1960]].  Other post-war projects included [[Bristol Cars]], which used pre-war [[BMW]] designs as the basis for a new car, the [[Bristol 400]]. The engine developed from this project found its way into many successful motor cars manufactured by other companies, such as [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], [[Frazer Nash]] and [[AC Cars|AC]], and in {{24hLM|1954}} and {{24hLM|1955}} powered Bristol's own [[Bristol 450]] [[sports car racing|sports prototype]] to class victories in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race.  The car company became independent in 1960, around the same time as the consolidation the British aircraft industry, but is still based at the Filton site. Pre-fabricated buildings, marine craft and plastic and composite materials were also early post-war activities, but these were eventually sold off. 

Bristol was involved in the post war renaissance of British civilian aircraft as inspired by the [[Brabazon Committee]] report. In 1949, the [[Bristol Brabazon]] airliner prototype, at the time one of the largest aircraft in the world, first flew. The Brabazon airliner project was a step in the wrong direction and ultimately cancelled in 1953. At the same time the [[Bristol Britannia]] turboprop-powered airliner proved a huge success and it and the [[Bristol Freighter]] transport aircraft were produced in quantity during the 1950s. Bristol was also involved in [[helicopter]] development with the [[Bristol Belvedere]] and [[Bristol Sycamore]] helicopters going into quantity production.

Another post-war activity was [[missile]] development, culminating in the production of the [[Bristol Bloodhound]] anti-aircraft missile. Bristol Aero Engines produced a range of [[rocket motor]]s and [[ramjet]]s for missile propulsion. The guided weapons division eventually became part of  Matra BAe Dynamics Alenia ([[MBDA]]).

In the late 1950s the Company undertook supersonic transport (SST) project studies, which were later to contribute to [[Concorde]]. A research aircraft, the [[Bristol 188]], was constructed in the 1950s to test the feasibility of [[stainless steel]] as a material in a Mach 2.0 airframe. By the time the aircraft flew in 1962, the Company was already part of the British Aircraft Corporation.

===Merger into BAC===
In 1959 Bristol was forced by Government policy to merge with [[English Electric]], [[Hunting Aircraft]] and [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] to form the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC). In 1977, BAC was nationalised, along with [[Scottish Aviation]] and [[Hawker Siddeley]] to form [[British Aerospace]] (BAe). BAe later became [[BAE Systems]].

==Bristol Engine Company==
The '''Bristol Engine Company''' was originally a separate entity, [[Cosmos Engineering]], in turn formed from the pre-First World War automobile company, Brazil-Straker. In 1917 Cosmos was asked to investigate air-cooled [[radial engine]]s, producing what would become the [[Bristol Mercury]], a 14 cylinder two-row (helical) radial, which they launched in 1918. This engine saw little use, but a smaller and simpler 9 cylinder version known as the [[Bristol Jupiter]] was clearly a winning design. 

With the post-war rapid contraction of military orders Cosmos Engineering went [[bankrupt]], and the [[Air Ministry]] let it be known that it would be a good idea if the Bristol Aeroplane Company purchased them. The Jupiter competed with the [[Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar]] through the 1920s, but Bristol put more effort into their design, and by 1929, the Jupiter was clearly superior. In the 1930s they developed a [[Bristol Perseus|new line of radials]] based on the [[sleeve valve]] principle, which would develop into some of the most powerful piston engines in the world, and could continue to be sold into the 1960s. 

In 1956 the division was renamed '''Bristol Aero Engines''', and then merged with [[Armstrong Siddeley]] in 1958 to form '''[[Bristol Siddeley]]''' as a counterpart of the airframe-producing company mergers that formed BAC. In 1966 Bristol Siddeley was purchased by [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], leaving the latter as the only major aero-engine company in Britain. Rolls-Royce continues to produce aircraft engines as [[Rolls-Royce plc]]. A number of Bristol Siddeley engines of Bristol heritage continued to be developed by Rolls-Royce; notably the [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Olympus]] turbojet and the [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus]]. The classical names favoured by Bristol indicated their heritage in a Rolls-Royce lineup named after [[Rivers of the United Kingdom|British Rivers]]
