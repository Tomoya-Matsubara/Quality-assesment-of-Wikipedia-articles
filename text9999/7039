'''''Ed, Edd n Eddy''''' is an original [[animated television series]] created by [[Danny Antonucci]] and produced by Canadian-based [[a.k.a. Cartoon]]. It premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on January 4, 1999. The series revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds," who hang around in a suburban [[cul-de-sac]]. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly scheme to make money off their peers in order to purchase their favorite confectionery; [[jawbreakers]]. However, their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments. 

Antonucci spent months designing the show similar to classic cartoons of the 1940s. He shopped it to [[Nickelodeon]], which demanded creative control. Antonucci refused to give it, so he took the show to Cartoon Network, which quickly picked it up. There have been a number of specials and shorts produced in which the Eds would appear apart from their regular series airings. A number of [[Video game|video games]] either based on the series or featuring the series' characters have also been produced. The series' finale movie, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show'' aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series. However, reruns continued to air on the network until July 1, 2011. On April 6, 2012, the series received another ability to air re-runs on the revived block "Cartoon Planet."

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' received generally positive reviews from critics. With a viewership of 31 million households and aired in 29 different countries, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' was popular amongst kids, as well as adults. Receiving several of awards and nominations, it remains Cartoon Network's longest running original series, as well as the longest running Canadian-made animated series to date, and is considered to be one of Cartoon Network's best works.

==Overview==
{{See also|List of Ed, Edd n Eddy characters|List of Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes}}

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' revolves solely around the Eds, the other [[cul-de-sac]] children, and the Kanker sisters. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds hang around in a [[suburban]] [[cul-de-sac]] and constantly scheme to make money off their peers in order to purchase their favorite confectionery; [[jawbreakers]]. However, their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments. The series takes place within the fictional town of Peach Creek and new locations are rarely introduced. There is no given timeline for the show. For the first four seasons the show took place during a perpetual summer. Starting with its fifth season, the characters were shown going to school. Most of the episodes begin with something completely unrelated to the storyline of the episode.

The number of characters in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' is fixed at twelve (thirteen, if Plank, who is also considered a character, is included). Until the debut of the movie ''[[List of Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes#Film|Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show]]'', where Eddy's brother, an adult, was shown for the first time, no other characters besides the main cast were ever seen; however the show started to hint at the presence of other people in its fifth season, occasionally showing the silhouettes of people and in one episode the arms of Eddy's father and Ed's mother. Beyond these partial exceptions, Eddy's brother is the only adult to appear on the show.

The show frequently makes [[meta-reference]]s and breaks the [[fourth wall]]. In addition, the letters ''AKA'', the abbreviation for the name of the company that produces the show (''a.k.a. Cartoon''), frequently appear in the show on license plates and other items.

==Production==  
Feeling pigeon-holed as an angst-ridden, "edgy" artist, Antonucci decided to produce an animated children's television show again.<ref name=Season1DVD/> He resolved, however, to ensure that the series was produced in a way similar to the classic cartoons of the 1940s.<ref name=Season1DVD/>  Antonucci spent months designing the show, and shopped it to [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], which demanded [[Artistic control|creative control]].<ref name=Season1DVD/>  Antonucci refused to give it, so he took the show to [[Cartoon Network]], which quickly picked it up.<ref name="animationbymistake1"/>  Cartoon Network also wanted Antonucci to show them more of his work, but they decided to let Antonucci go at his own pace.<ref name=Season1DVD/>

Antonucci is a strong advocate of hand-drawn animation. The wobbling animation in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' is an homage to the hand-drawn cartoons with a style that harkens back to cartoons of the 1930s-1950s.<ref name=Season1DVD/> To give the impression of movement, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' uses shimmering character outlines similar to [[Squigglevision]];<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2"/> The crawling lines are not nearly as active as those in ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', but are still visible,<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2">{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Shumway|coauthors=Wayne, Lamont|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: A Unique Approach|date=June 1999|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.03/4.03pages/SCAD_EEE.php3|work=Animation World Magazine|issue=4.3|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.<ref name=Season1DVD/>

According to Danny Antonucci, the characters were based on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons.<ref name=Season1DVD>{{cite video| people =[[Danny Antonucci]]| year = 2006| title = Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season<U+2014>''Interview with the Creator''| format = DVD| publisher = ''[[Warner Home Video]]''}}</ref> The Eds also held personality traits of [[The Three Stooges]], who were a comedy trio whose various characters they portrayed in each short subject film often try to create money-making schemes, but their plans end up backfiring near the end of their films.<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2"/> The cul-de-sac kids were based on kids he grew up with.<ref name=Season1DVD/> Antonucci also stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, stating that he "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do.<ref name=Season1DVD/> He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living.<ref name=Season1DVD/> The kids have multi-colored tongues because, as Danny Antonucci stated, kids are almost always eating something that turn their tongues different colors.<ref name="animationbymistake1">{{cite web|url=http://animationbymistake.fateback.com/abm/dannytalk.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302131130/http://animationbymistake.fateback.com/abm/dannytalk.html|archivedate=2008-03-02|title=Animation By Mistake: Chatting with Danny Antonucci|author=Topp, Kit R R|date=October 2002|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref>

It has been noted that there is a lack of adults in the show, which Antonucci stated was intentional explaining, "throughout the long days of summer you simply didn't see anyone else's parents about and sometimes you didn't even see your own. Take the 'Edd's parents' factor, their means of communicating with him via sticky note, my parents worked long hours and they left me written messages in much the same way."<ref name="animationbymistake1"/> 

The series' finale movie, Ed, ''Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show'' aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.<ref name=BigPS/> However, reruns continued to air on the network until July 1, 2011. On April 6, 2012, the series received another ability to air re-runs on the revived block "Cartoon Planet."<ref>{{cite news|last=Walton|first=Zach|title=Cartoon Network Brings Back The Classics With Cartoon Planet|url=http://www.webpronews.com/cartoon-network-brings-back-the-classics-with-cartoon-planet-2012-03|work=WebProNews|publisher=''iEntry Network''|accessdate=31 March 2012|date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

There have been other produced works in which the Eds would appear apart from their regular series airings. They have appeared in a ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'' episode using ''Foster's'' styled animation,<ref name=Fosters>{{Cite episode |title=Eddie Monster |series=[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]] |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |year=July 22, 2005 |season=3}}</ref> and made a short [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door'', a crossover of ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'' and ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]''; They also they appeared in a small crossover poster during its credits entitled ''Ed, Edd n Mandy''.<ref name=GrimKND>{{Cite episode |title=The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door |series=[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]] / [[Codename: Kids Next Door]] |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |year=November 11, 2007}}</ref>

Cartoon Network has also produced shorts, some involving the Eds during commercial breaks. There was also a short music video with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy and Sarah, entitled "The Incredible Shrinking Day" (listed on the Season 2 DVD as "I'm Not Coming in Anymore"),<ref name=Season2DVD>{{cite video| year = 2007| title = Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete Second Season<U+2014>''"I'm Not Coming in Anymore"''| format = DVD| publisher = ''[[Warner Home Video]]''}}</ref> which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video Sarah uses a [[potion]] to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her [[dollhouse]], with predictable results.<ref name=Sarah>{{cite episode |title =The Incredible Shrinking Day |series=Ed, Edd n Eddy |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |year=2002/2003}}</ref> Plank starred in a similar video called "My Best Friend Plank", which aired in 2002.<ref name=Plank>{{cite episode |title =My Best Friend Plank |series=Ed, Edd n Eddy |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |year=2002}}</ref>

There have been many specials in which [[Cartoon Network]] would run all day marathons for either a promotion or just a special airing for one of their shows. A [[Marathon (television)|marathon]] called "The Best Day Edder" aired from April 27 to April 28, 2007, in which every episode was shown in chronological order, ending with the previously unaired last episode of Season 5.<ref name=BestDayEdder>{{cite episode|title=The Best Day Edder |series=Ed, Edd n Eddy |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |date=April 27-April 28, 2007}}</ref>

Amongst others, a special episode of ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' aired on May 11, 2007 in the Cartoon Network event, [[Cartoon Network Invaded|Invaded]], in which aliens invade Rolf's house. This alien invasion is in adjunct with the other Cartoon Network series ''Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', and ''The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy''. The episode is part of "Cartoon Network Invaded," a mini-series that aired all 5 specials on May 28, 2007.<ref name=Invaded>{{cite episode|title=The Eds are Coming, The Eds are Coming |series=Ed, Edd n Eddy / '''[[Cartoon Network Invaded]]''' |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |date=May 28, 2007}}</ref>

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' received generally positive reviews from critis. Terrence Briggs of ''[[Animation World Network|Animation World Magazine]]'' argued that every second of the show is "filler" and that the main characters are drawn as "products from the school of acid-trip caricature."<ref name='Briggs'>{{cite news|first=Terence|last=Briggs|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: Caught in a Circle|date=February 1999|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.11/3.11pages/tveddy.php3|work=[[Animation World Network|Animation World Magazine]]|issue=3.11|accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> After the review was published, a very high number of support letters for the show started to pile up at ''Animation World Magazine''{{'}}s website.
