The '''Battle of Quebec''' (French: '''Bataille de Qu<U+00E9>bec''') was fought on December 31, 1775 between American [[Continental Army]] forces and the British defenders of the [[Quebec City|city of Quebec]], early in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The battle was the first major defeat of the war for the Americans, and it came at a high price.  General [[Richard Montgomery]] was killed, [[Benedict Arnold]] was wounded, and [[Daniel Morgan]] and more than 400 men were taken prisoner.  The city's garrison, a motley assortment of regular troops and militia led by [[Province of Quebec (1763<U+2013>1791)|Quebec]]'s provincial governor, General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], suffered a small number of casualties.

Montgomery's army had captured Montreal on November 13, and in early December they joined a force led by Arnold, whose men had made an [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|arduous trek]] through the wilderness of northern [[New England]].  Governor Carleton had escaped from Montreal to Quebec, the Americans' next objective, and last-minute reinforcements arrived to bolster the city's limited defenses before the attacking force's arrival.  Concerned that expiring enlistments would reduce his force, Montgomery made the end-of-year attack in a blinding snowstorm to conceal his army's movements.  The plan was for separate forces led by Montgomery and Arnold to converge in the lower city before scaling the walls protecting the upper city.  Montgomery's force turned back after he was killed by cannon fire early in the battle, but Arnold's force penetrated further into the lower city.  Arnold was injured early in the attack, and Morgan led the assault in his place before he became trapped in the lower city and was forced to surrender.  Arnold and the Americans maintained an ineffectual blockade of the city until spring, when British reinforcements arrived.

In the battle and the following siege, French-speaking [[Canadien]]s were active on both sides of the conflict. The American forces received supplies and logistical support from local residents, and the city's defenders included locally raised militia. When the Americans retreated, they were accompanied by a number of their supporters; those who remained behind were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re-established control over the province.

In this black and white engraving, he is wearing a military jacket with epaulets.  His long hair (possibly a wig) is tied back.]]

Shortly after the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in April 1775, a small enterprising force led by [[Ethan Allen]] and [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured]] the key [[Fort Ticonderoga|fortress at Ticonderoga]] on May 10.  Arnold followed up the capture with a raid on [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort Saint-Jean]] not far from [[Montreal]], alarming the British leadership there.<ref name="Lanctot44_5">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref>  These actions stimulated both British and rebel leaders to consider the possibility of an invasion of the [[Province of Quebec (1763<U+2013>1791)|Province of Quebec]] by the rebellious forces of the [[Second Continental Congress]], and Quebec's governor, General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], began mobilizing the provincial defenses.  After first rejecting the idea of an attack on Quebec, the Congress authorized the [[Continental Army]]'s commander of its Northern Department, Major General [[Philip Schuyler]], to invade the province if he felt it necessary.  Schuyler immediately began working to acquire men and materiel for an expedition at Ticonderoga and [[Fort Crown Point]].  As part of an American propaganda offensive, [[Letters to the inhabitants of Canada|letters from Congress]] and the New York Provincial Assembly were circulated throughout the province, promising liberation from their oppressive government.<ref name="Lanctot63">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 47<U+2013>49,63</ref>  Benedict Arnold, passed over for command of the expedition, convinced General [[George Washington]] to authorize a second expedition through the wilderness of what is now the state of [[Maine]] directly to [[Quebec City]].<ref>[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], p. 97</ref>

The Continental Army began [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|moving into Quebec]] in September 1775.  Its goal, as stated in a proclamation by General Schuyler, was to "drive away, if possible, the troops of Great Britain" that "under the orders of a despotic ministry ... aim to subject their fellow-citizens and brethren to the yoke of a hard slavery."<ref>[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907), vol 1]], p. 326</ref>  Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] led the force from Ticonderoga and Crown Point up [[Lake Champlain]], successfully [[Siege of Fort St. Jean|besieging Fort St. Jean]], and capturing Montreal on November 13.  Arnold led a force of 1,100 men from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|the expedition through Maine]] towards Quebec shortly after Montgomery's departure from Ticonderoga.<ref name="Stanley37_80">[[#Stanley|Stanley (1973)]], pp. 37<U+2013>80</ref>

One significant expectation of the American advance into Quebec was that the large French Catholic [[Canadien]] population of the province and city would rise against British rule:  since the British took control of the province, during the [[French and Indian War]] in 1760, there had been difficulties and disagreements between the local population and the Protestant English-speaking British military and civilian administrations.  Tensions were eased by the passage of the [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which restored some civil rights to Catholics and recognized the Catholic establishment.  The majority of Quebec's French inhabitants chose not to play an active role in the American campaign, in part because they had come to accept British rule with its backing of the Catholic Church and preservation of French culture.<ref>[[#Black|Black (2009)]], pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>

==British preparations==
===Defense of the province===
General Carleton had begun preparing the province's defense immediately on learning of Arnold's raid on St. Jean.  Although Carleton concentrated most of his modest force at Fort St. Jean, he left small garrisons of British [[regular army]] troops at Montreal and Quebec.<ref name="Stanley36_21">[[#Stanley|Stanley (1973)]], pp. 21<U+2013>36</ref>  Carleton followed the American invasion's progress, occasionally receiving intercepted communications between Montgomery and Arnold.  Lieutenant Governor [[Hector Theophilus de Cramah<U+00E9>|Hector Cramah<U+00E9>]], in charge of Quebec's defenses while Carleton was in Montreal, organized a militia force of several hundred to defend the town in September.  He pessimistically thought they were "not much to be depended on", estimating that only half were reliable.<ref name="Smith142_12">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], pp. 10<U+2013>12</ref>  Cramah<U+00E9> also made numerous requests for military reinforcements to the military leadership in [[Boston]], but each of these came to nought.  Several troop ships were blown off course and ended up in New York, and Vice Admiral [[Samuel Graves]], commanding the fleet in Boston, refused to release ships to transport troops from there to Quebec because the approaching winter would close the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name="Smith142_14">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>

[[Image:Guy Carleton.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], commander of the forces in the city (painter unknown)|alt=A half-height portrait of Carleton.  He wears a red coat with vest, over a white shirt with ruffles.  His white hair is drawn back, and he faces front with a neutral expression.]]
When definitive word reached Quebec on November 3 that Arnold's march had succeeded and that he was approaching the city, Cramah<U+00E9> began tightening the guard and had all boats removed from the south shore of the Saint Lawrence.<ref name="Smith142_9">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref>  Word of Arnold's approach resulted in further militia enlistments, increasing the ranks to 1,200 or more.<ref name="Smith142_12"/>  Two ships arrived on November 3, followed by a third the next day, carrying militia volunteers from [[Prince Edward Island|St. John's Island]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] that added about 120 men to the defense.  A small convoy headed by {{HMS|Lizard|1757|6}} also arrived that day, from which a number of marines were added to the town's defenses.<ref name="Smith142_16">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], p. 16</ref>

On November 10, Lieutenant Colonel [[Allan Maclean of Torloisk|Allen Maclean]], who had been involved in an attempt to lift the siege at St. Jean, arrived with 200 men of his [[84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants)|Royal Highland Emigrants]].  They had intercepted communications from Arnold to Montgomery near [[Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res]], and hurried to Quebec to help with its defense.  The arrival of this experienced force boosted the morale of the town militia, and Maclean immediately took charge of the defenses.<ref name="Smith142_21">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], p. 21</ref>

===Carleton arrives at Quebec===
In the wake of the fall of Fort St. Jean, Carleton abandoned Montreal and returned to Quebec City by ship, narrowly escaping capture.<ref name="SmithFourteen487">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 1]], pp. 487<U+2013>490</ref>  Upon his arrival on November 19 he immediately took command.  Three days later, he issued a proclamation that any able-bodied man in the town who did not take up arms would be assumed to be a rebel or a spy, and would be treated as such.  Men not taking up arms were given four days to leave.<ref name="Smith142_95">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], p. 95</ref>  As a result, about 500&nbsp;inhabitants (including 200&nbsp;British and 300&nbsp;Canadiens) joined the defense.<ref name="Shelton130">[[#Shelton|Shelton (1996)]], p. 130</ref>

Carleton addressed the weak points of the town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and [[palisade]]s erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along the walls and the inner defenses;<ref name="Wood49"/> and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.<ref name="Smith142_97">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref>

==Arnold's arrival==
{{details3|[[Arnold's expedition to Quebec]]|how Arnold reached Quebec City}}
[[Image:Benedict Arnold 1color.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Benedict Arnold]] in 1776, mezzotint engraving by Thomas Hart|alt=A knee-length mezzotint engraved portrait of Arnold.

A sword handle is visible near his left hip, and his right hand is held out.  In the near background a tree is visible, and there is a town off in the distance behind him.]]

The men Arnold chose for his expedition were volunteers drawn from New England companies serving in the [[Siege of Boston]].  They were formed into two battalions for the expedition; a third battalion was composed of riflemen from [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Virginia]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[Daniel Morgan]]'s command.  The trek through the wilderness of Maine was long and difficult.  The conditions were wet and cold, and the journey took much longer than either Arnold or Washington had expected.  Bad weather and wrecked boats spoiled much of the expedition's food stores, and about 500&nbsp;men of the original 1,100 died en route or turned back.  Those who turned back, including one of the New England battalions, took many of the remaining provisions with them.  The men who continued on were starving by the time they reached the first French settlements in early November.<ref>[[#Nelson|Nelson (2006)]], pp. 76<U+2013>132</ref>  On November&nbsp;9, the 600&nbsp;survivors of Arnold's march from Boston to Quebec arrived at [[L<U+00E9>vis, Quebec|Point Levis]], on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence opposite Quebec City.  Despite the condition of his troops, Arnold immediately began to gather boats to make a crossing.  He was prepared to do so on the night of November 10, but a storm delayed him for three days.  Once on the other side of the Saint Lawrence, Arnold moved his troops onto the [[Plains of Abraham]], about 1.5&nbsp;miles (2&nbsp;km) from the city walls.<ref name="Wood44">[[#Wood|Wood (2003)]], p. 44</ref>

The troops approaching Quebec's walls were significantly under-equipped.  Arnold had no artillery, each of his men carried only five [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s, more than 100&nbsp;muskets were unserviceable, and the men's clothing had been reduced to rags.  Despite being outnumbered two to one, Arnold demanded the city's surrender. Both envoys he sent were shot at by British cannons, signifying that the demand was declined.<ref name="Wood46">[[#Wood|Wood (2003)]], p. 46</ref> Arnold concluded that he could not take the city by force, so he blockaded the city on its west side.  On November&nbsp;18, the Americans heard a (false) rumor that the British were planning to attack them with 800&nbsp;men.  At a council of war, they decided that the blockade could not be maintained, and Arnold began to move his men {{convert|20|mi|km}} upriver to [[Neuville, Quebec|Pointe-aux-Trembles]] ("Aspen Point") to wait for Montgomery, who had just taken Montreal.<ref name="Wood46"/>

==Montgomery's arrival==
[[Image:American attack on Quebec.svg|thumb|200px|Invasion routes of Montgomery and Arnold|alt=Montgomery's route started at Fort Ticonderoga in eastern upstate New York, went north along Lake Champlain to Montreal, and then followed the Saint Lawrence River downstream to Quebec.  Arnold's route started at Cambridge, Massachusetts, went overland to Newburyport and by sea to present-day Maine.  From there, it went up the Kennebec River and over a height of land separating the Kennebec and Chaudi<U+00E8>re watersheds to Lake M<U+00E9>gantic.  It then descended the Chaudi<U+00E8>re River to Quebec City.]]
On December 1, Montgomery arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles.  His force consisted of 300&nbsp;men from the [[1st New York Regiment|1st]], [[2nd New York Regiment|2nd]], and [[3rd New York Regiment|3rd]] New York regiments, a company of artillery raised by [[John Lamb (general)|John Lamb]],<ref name="Gabriel143">Gabriel, p. 143</ref> about 200&nbsp;men recruited by [[James Livingston (American Revolution)|James Livingston]] for the [[1st Canadian Regiment]], and another 160&nbsp;men led by Jacob Brown who were remnants of regiments disbanded due to expiring enlistments.<ref name="Wood47"/><ref name="Smith142_86>[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907), vol 2]], p. 86</ref>  These were supplemented several days later by a few companies detached by Major General [[David Wooster]], whom Montgomery had left in command at Montreal.<ref name="Gabriel143"/>  The artillery Montgomery brought included four cannons and six mortars, and he also brought winter clothing and other supplies for Arnold's men; the clothing and supplies were a prize taken when most of the British ships fleeing Montreal were captured.  The commanders quickly turned towards Quebec, and put the city under siege on December 6.<ref name="Wood47">[[#Wood|Wood (2003)]], p. 47</ref>  Montgomery sent a personal letter to Carleton demanding the city's surrender, employing a woman as the messenger. Carleton declined the request and burned the letter unread. Montgomery tried again ten days later, with the same result.<ref name="Wood47"/>  The besiegers continued to send messages, primarily intended for the populace in the city, describing the situation there as hopeless, and suggesting that conditions would improve if they rose to assist the Americans.<ref name="Smith142_100">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907) vol 2]], pp. 100<U+2013>101</ref>

[[Image:Quebec1775FrenchMap.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A 1777 French map depicting the points of action in and around Quebec|alt=The city occupies a promontory on the north shore overlooking a bend in the Saint Lawrence River.  Most of the town is surrounded by a wall with bastions, but the lower city, where the port facilities are, is not protected.  The lower city is accessible by a narrow path from the west or a roadway from the north.  The Plains of Abraham, where the Americans camped, are to the west of the city.  The Palace Gate is on the north side of the city, near where the access to the lower city begins.]]
On December 10, the Americans set up their largest battery of artillery {{convert|700|yd|m}} from the walls.  The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery, so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks.<ref name="Wood47"/>  This battery was used to fire on the city, but the damage it did was of little consequence.  Montgomery realized he was in a very difficult position, because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches, and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city's defenses.  The enlistments of Arnold's men were expiring at the end of the year, and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies. Furthermore, it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring, meaning he would either have to act or withdraw.  Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night, when his men could scale the walls undetected.<ref name="Wood48">[[#Wood|Wood (2003)]], p. 48</ref>

While Montgomery planned the attack on the city, [[Christophe P<U+00E9>lissier]], a Frenchman living near Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res, came to see him.  P<U+00E9>lissier was a political supporter of the American cause who operated an ironworks at [[Saint-Maurice, Quebec|Saint-Maurice]].<ref>[[#PelissierBio|Fortier]]</ref>  He and Montgomery discussed the idea of holding a provincial convention to elect representatives to Congress.  P<U+00E9>lissier recommended against this until after Quebec City had been taken, as the [[habitants]] would not feel free to act in that way until their security was better assured.<ref name="Gabriel185_186">[[#Gabriel|Gabriel (2002)]], pp. 185<U+2013>186</ref>  The two agreed that P<U+00E9>lissier's ironworks would provide munitions (ammunition, cannonballs, and the like) for the siege.  This P<U+00E9>lissier did until the Americans retreated in May 1776, at which time he also fled, eventually returning to France.<ref name="ProcRSC1886_1_4_85_86">[[#ProcRSC1886 1 4|Royal Society of Canada (1887)]], pp. 85<U+2013>86</ref>

A snowstorm arrived on the night of December 27, prompting Montgomery to prepare the troops for the attack.  However, the storm subsided, and Montgomery called off the assault.  That night, a sergeant from Rhode Island deserted, carrying the plan of attack to the British.  Montgomery consequently drafted a new plan; this one called for two [[feint]]s against Quebec's western walls, to be led by Jacob Brown and James Livingston,<ref name="JCong82">[[#JCong|United States Continental Congress (1907)]], p. 82</ref> while two attacks would be mounted against the lower town.<ref name="Wood48"/> Arnold would lead one attack to smash through the defenses at the north end of the lower town, and Montgomery would follow along the Saint Lawrence south of the town. The two forces would meet in the lower town and then launch a combined assault on the upper town by scaling its walls. The new plan was revealed only to the senior officers.<ref name="Wood49">[[#Wood|Wood (2003)]], p. 49</ref>

==Battle==
===Montgomery's attack===

A cannon lies broken in the foreground, and snow and gunsmoke swirl around the scene.  An Indian stands nearby with a raised tomahawk.]]
A storm broke out on December 30, and Montgomery once again gave orders for the attack.  Brown and Livingston led their militia companies to their assigned positions that night: Brown by the Cape Diamond bastion, and Livingston outside St. John's Gate.  When Brown reached his position between 4 am and 5 am, he fired flares to signal the other forces, and his men and Livingston's began to fire on their respective targets.<ref name="Gabriel163">[[#Gabriel|Gabriel (2002)]], p. 163</ref>  Montgomery and Arnold, seeing the flares, set off for the lower town.<ref name="Wood49"/>

Montgomery led his men down the steep, snow-heaped path towards the outer defenses. The storm had turned into a blizzard, making the advance a struggle. Montgomery's men eventually arrived at the palisade of the outer defenses, where an advance party of carpenters sawed their way though the wall.  Montgomery himself helped saw through the second palisade, and led 50&nbsp;men down a street towards a two-story building.  The building formed part of the city's defenses, and was in fact a [[blockhouse]] occupied by 15&nbsp;Quebec militia armed with muskets and cannons.  The defenders opened fire at close range, and Montgomery was killed instantly, shot through the head by a burst of [[grapeshot]].  The few men of the advance party who survived fled back towards the palisade; only [[Aaron Burr]] and a few others escaped unhurt.<ref name="Wood50">[[#Wood|Wood (2003)]], p. 50</ref>  Many of Montgomery's officers were injured in the attack; one of the few remaining uninjured officers led the survivors back to the Plains of Abraham, leaving Montgomery's body behind.<ref name="Gabriel167">[[#Gabriel|Gabriel (2002)]], p. 167</ref>

===Arnold's attack===
While Montgomery was making his advance, Arnold advanced with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault-au-Matelot at the northern end of the lower town.<ref name="Lanctot106">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], p. 106</ref>  They passed the outer gates and some British gun batteries undetected.  However, as the advance party moved around the Palace Gate, heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them.<ref name="Smith2_130">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907), vol 2]], p. 130</ref>  The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders' fire, therefore Arnold ordered his men to run forward. They advanced down a narrow street, where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade.  Arnold received a shot in the ankle as he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade and was carried to the rear, after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan.<ref name="Wood51">[[#Wood|Wood (2003)]], p. 51</ref> Under Morgan's command, they captured the barricade, but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder, which prevented their muskets from firing. Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm, but they eventually came under increasing fire; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town. A British force of 500&nbsp;sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men in the city.<ref name="Smith145">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907), vol 2]], p. 145</ref> With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire, Morgan and his men surrendered. The battle was over by 10&nbsp;am.<ref name="Gabriel164">[[#Gabriel|Gabriel (2002)]], p. 164</ref>

This was the first defeat suffered by the [[Continental Army]].  Carleton reported 30&nbsp;Americans killed and 431&nbsp;taken prisoner, including about two-thirds of Arnold's force.  He also wrote that "many perished on the River" attempting to get away.<ref name="Smith581">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907), vol 2]], p. 581</ref>  Allan Maclean reported that 20&nbsp;bodies were recovered in the spring thaw the following May.  Arnold reported about 400&nbsp;missing or captured, and his official report to Congress claimed 60&nbsp;killed and 300&nbsp;captured.<ref name="Smith581"/>  British casualties were comparatively light.  Carleton's initial report to General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] mentioned only five killed or wounded, but other witness reports ranged as high as 50.<ref name="Smith582">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907), vol 2]], p. 582</ref>  Carleton's official report listed five killed and 14&nbsp;wounded.<ref name="Gabriel170">[[#Gabriel|Gabriel (2002)]] p. 170</ref>

General Montgomery's body was recovered by the British on [[New Years Day]] 1776 and was given a simple military funeral on January&nbsp;4, paid for by Lieutenant Governor Cramah<U+00E9>. The body was returned to New York in 1818.<ref name=Sutherland>[[#Sutherland|Sutherland]]</ref>

==Siege==
Arnold refused to retreat; despite being outnumbered three to one, the sub-freezing temperature of the winter and the mass departure of his men after their enlistments expired, he laid siege to Quebec. The siege had relatively little effect on the city, which Carleton claimed had enough supplies stockpiled to last until May.<ref name="Stanley86">[[#Stanley|Stanley (1973)]], p. 86</ref>  Immediately after the battle, Arnold sent [[Moses Hazen]] and [[Edward Antill]] to Montreal, where they informed General Wooster of the defeat.  They then traveled on to Philadelphia to report the defeat to Congress and request support.  (Both Hazen and Antill, English-speakers originally from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who had settled in Quebec, went on to serve in the Continental Army for the rest of the war.)<ref name="LacoursiereHistoire433"/>  In response to their report, Congress ordered reinforcements to be raised and sent north.  During the winter months, small companies of men from hastily recruited regiments in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut made their way north to supplement the Continental garrisons at Quebec and Montreal.<ref>[[#Morrissey|Morrissey (2003)]], p. 25</ref>  The presence of disease in the camp outside Quebec, especially [[smallpox]], took a significant toll on the besiegers, as did a general lack of provisions.<ref name="Lanctot126">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], p. 126</ref>  In early April, Arnold was replaced by General Wooster, who was himself replaced in late April by General [[John Thomas (general)|John Thomas]].<ref name="Lanctot136_142">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 136<U+2013>142</ref>

Governor Carleton, despite appearing to have a significant advantage in manpower, chose not to attack the American camp, and remained within Quebec's walls.  Montgomery, in analyzing the situation before the battle, had observed that Carleton served under [[James Wolfe]] during the 1759 [[Siege of Quebec (1759)|Siege of Quebec]], and knew that the French General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] had paid a heavy price for leaving the city's defenses, ultimately losing the city and his life in the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]. British General [[James Murray (British Army officer)|James Murray]] had also lost [[Battle of Sainte-Foy|a battle]] outside the city in 1760; Montgomery judged that Carleton was unlikely to repeat their mistakes.<ref name="Smith248_9">[[#SmithFourteenII|Smith (1907), vol 2]], pp. 248<U+2013>249</ref>  On March 14, Jean-Baptiste Chasseur, a miller from the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence, reached Quebec City and informed Carleton there were 200&nbsp;men on the south side of the river ready to act against the Americans.<ref name="Lanctot130">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], p. 130</ref>  These men and more were mobilized to make an attack on an American gun battery at Point Levis, but an advance guard of this [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] militia was defeated in the March 1776 [[Battle of Saint-Pierre]] by a detachment of pro-American local militia.<ref name="Lanctot131_132">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 131<U+2013>132</ref>

When General Thomas arrived, the conditions in the camp led him to conclude that the siege was impossible to maintain, and he began preparing to retreat.  The arrival on May 6 of a small British fleet carrying 200&nbsp;regulars (the vanguard of a much larger invasion force), accelerated the American preparations to depart.  The retreat was turned into a near rout when Carleton marched these fresh forces, along with most of his existing garrison, out of the city to face the disorganized Americans.<ref name="CarletonLetter">[[#CarletonLetter|Fraser (1907)]], p. 100. Letter from Carleton to Germain dated May 14, 1776</ref>  The American forces, ravaged by smallpox (which claimed General Thomas during the retreat), eventually retreated all the way back to Fort Ticonderoga.<ref name="Lanctot141_146">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 141<U+2013>146</ref>  Carleton then launched a counteroffensive to regain the forts on Lake Champlain.  Although he successfully defeated the American fleet in the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] and regained control of the lake, the rear guard defense managed by Benedict Arnold prevented further action to capture Ticonderoga or Crown Point in 1776.<ref name="Lanctot162_163">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 162<U+2013>163</ref>

==Aftermath==
On May 22, even before the Americans had been completely driven from the province, Carleton ordered a survey to identify the Canadiens who had helped the American expedition in and around Quebec City. [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Baby (businessman)|Fran<U+00E7>ois Baby]], [[Gabriel-Elz<U+00E9>ar Taschereau]], and [[Jenkin Williams]] traveled the province and counted the Canadiens who actively provided such help; they determined that 757&nbsp;had done so.<ref name="LacoursiereHistoire433">[[#LacoursiereHistoire|Lacoursi<U+00E8>re (1995)]], p. 433</ref>  Carleton was somewhat lenient with minor offenders, and even freed a number of more serious offenders on the promise of good behavior.  However, once the Americans had been driven from the province, measures against supporters of the American cause became harsher, with forced labor to repair American destruction of infrastructure during the army's retreat being a frequent punishment.<ref name="Lanctot151">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], p. 151</ref>  These measures had the effect of minimizing the public expression of support for the Americans for the rest of the war.<ref name="LacoursiereHistoire429">[[#LacoursiereHistoire|Lacoursi<U+00E8>re (1995)]], p. 429</ref>

Between May 6 and June 1, 1776, nearly 40&nbsp;British ships arrived at Quebec City.<ref name="Nelson212">[[#Nelson|Nelson (2006)]], p. 212</ref> They carried more than 9,000&nbsp;soldiers under the command of General [[John Burgoyne]], including about 4,000&nbsp;German soldiers; so-called [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]]s from [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and [[Hanau]] under the command of Baron [[Friedrich Adolf Riedesel]].<ref name="BritishArrivals1">[[#Stanley|Stanley (1973)]], pp. 108,125,129,145</ref> These forces, some of which having participated in Carleton's counteroffensive, spent the winter of 1776<U+2013>77 in the province, putting a significant strain on the population, which numbered only about 80,000.<ref name="Lanctot31">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 31<!--population-->,144<!--action-->,154,155<!--wintered, strains--></ref>  Many of these troops were deployed in 1777 for Burgoyne's [[Saratoga campaign|campaign for the Hudson Valley]].<ref>[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 164<U+2013>165</ref>
