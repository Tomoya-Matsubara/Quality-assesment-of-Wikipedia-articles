'''HNoMS ''Mj<U+00F8>lner''''' was the fourth of five ships of the {{sclass|John Ericsson|monitor|0}} [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s built for the [[Royal Swedish Navy]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] in the mid-1860s.  Impressed by the use of ironclads during the American Civil War, the design was based on that of the {{USS|Monitor}}. They were designed under the supervision of the Swedish-born inventor, [[John Ericsson]]<U+2014>coincidentally, designer of the ''Monitor''<U+2014>, and built in Sweden. ''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' was delivered in 1868 and ran aground the following year, although she was not seriously damaged. The ship was reconstructed in 1897 and given modern [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading guns]]. ''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1909.

==Design and description==
The ''John Ericsson''-class [[ironclad]]s were designed to meet the need of the Swedish and Norwegian Navies for small, shallow-draft armored ships capable of defending their coastal waters. The standoff between the {{USS|Monitor}} and the much larger {{ship|CSS|Virginia||6}} during the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in, early 1862, roused much interest in Sweden in this [[monitor (warship)|new type of warship]], as it seemed ideal for coastal defense duties. John Ericsson, designer and builder of the ''Monitor'', born in Sweden<U+2014>although becoming an American citizen in 1848<U+2014>offered to share his design with the Swedes. In response, they sent Lieutenant John Christian d'Ailly to the United States to study monitor design and construction under Ericsson. D'Ailly arrived in July 1862 and toured [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mills]], [[Foundry|gun foundries]], and visited several different ironclads under construction. He returned to Sweden in 1863 having completed the drawings of a ''Monitor''-type ship under Ericsson's supervision.<ref>Harris 1994, pp. 22<U+2013>24</ref>

The ship measured {{convert|60.88|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.54|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|3.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|1522|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=g54/> ''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' was divided into nine main compartments by eight watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s. Over time a [[flying bridge]] and, later, a full superstructure, was added to each ship between the [[gun turret]] and the funnel.<ref name=b69>Bjoerud, p. 169</ref> Initially her crew numbered 80 officers and men, but this increased to 104 as she was modified with additional weapons.<ref name=g54>Harris 1994, p. 26</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ''John Ericsson''-class ships had one twin-cylinder [[Marine_steam_engine#Vibrating_lever|vibrating lever steam engines]], designed by Ericsson himself, driving a single four-bladed, {{convert|3.74|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} propeller. Their engines were powered by four [[fire-tube boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|40|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines produced a total of {{convert|380|ihp|lk=on}} which gave the monitors a maximum speed of {{convert|6.5|kn|lk=on}} in calm waters. The ships carried {{convert|110|t|LT|}} of coal, enough for six day's steaming.<ref>Harris 1994, pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref>

===Armament===
''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' was armed with a pair of [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] {{convert|270|mm|in|sp=us|1|adj=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading]] guns. Each gun was constructed of steel and weighed {{convert|18.5|LT|t}}. The ship also carried a {{convert|80|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} gun. During ''Mj<U+00F8>lner''{{'}}s reconstruction in 1897 her gun turret was fixed in place and modified to serve as a [[barbette]] for her two new [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] [[John Cockerill (company)|Cockerill]] {{convert|120|mm|adj=on|0|sp=us}} guns. She also received two {{convert|124|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} and {{convert|65|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} Cockerill guns mounted in her superstructure. In addition two {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]] were mounted in the superstructure.<ref>Harris 1994, pp. 27, 34</ref> They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|1.1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave them a range of about {{convert|3500|yd|m}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46" (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=22 August 2010|publisher=Navweps.com}}</ref>

===Armor===
The ''John Ericsson''-class ships had a complete waterline armor [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|1.8|m|ftin|sp=us}} high and {{convert|124|mm|in|1|sp=us}} thick. The armor consisted of five plates backed by {{convert|91|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of wood. The lower edge of this belt was {{convert|74.2|mm|in|1|sp=us}} thick as it was only three plates thick. The maximum thickness of the armored deck was {{convert|24.7|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in two layers. The [[gun turret]]'s armor consisted of twelve layers of iron, totalling {{convert|270|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in thickness on the first four monitors. The inside of the turret was lined with mattresses to catch splinters.<ref name=b69/> The base of the turret was protected with a {{convert|127|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[glacis]], {{convert|520|mm|in|1|sp=us}} high, and the turret's roof was 127&nbsp;millimeters thick.  The [[conning tower]] was positioned on top of the turret and its sides were ten layers ({{convert|250|mm|in|1|sp=us}}) thick. The funnel was protected by six layers of armor with a total thickness of {{convert|120|mm|in|1|sp=us}} up to half its height.<ref name=g54/><ref name=b69/>

==Service==
The Norwegians had built one monitor-type ship of their own, {{ship|HNoMS|Skorpionen||2}}, in 1865, and laid down several others, but the Norwegian Parliament authorized construction of ''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' in 1867 in Sweden at the cost of 1,102,000 [[Norwegian krone]].<ref group=Note>The exact relationship between the Norwegian {{sclass|Skorpionen|monitor}}s and the ''John Ericsson'' class is unclear. Harris 1994 says that the ''Skorpionen'' class merely had five, instead of four, boilers and were otherwise identical, see p. 34. But Gardiner cites slightly different dimensions and counts ''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' as part of the class, see p. 368, as does Silverstone, p. 350</ref> She was launched in 1868 and completed on 7 September of that year.<ref name=h27>Harris 1994, p. 27</ref> The ship ran aground at [[Krager<U+00F8>]] on 21 June 1869. ''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' could not be pulled off the rocks until the ship's ammunition, iron [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] and {{convert|120|LT|t}} of coal were removed. Her repairs were completed on 7 July 1869 by the Royal [[Dockyard]] at [[Horten]], at the cost of 5,000 krone. The [[Naval Board of Inquiry|court of inquiry]] found the ship's commander and the [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] liable for the repairs, but the parliament released the two from their obligation two years later.<ref name=h72>Harris 1995, p. 172</ref> She was visited by King [[Charles XV of Sweden]] on one occasion when visiting one of Sweden's west-coast ports in the early 1870s.<ref name=h27/> ''Mj<U+00F8>lner'' was [[Wikt:mothball|laid up]] after her refit in 1897, but was mobilized during 1905 when the [[personal union]] between [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden and Norway]] was dissolved. She returned to reserve afterward before being sold for scrap in 1909.<ref name=h72/>
