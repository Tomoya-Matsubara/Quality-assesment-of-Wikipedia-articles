[[File:LakeVostok-Location.jpg|thumb|left|Location of Lake Vostok in [[East Antarctica]]]]
Russian scientist [[Peter Kropotkin]] first proposed the idea of fresh water under Antarctic [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the 19th century.<ref>"Research on the [[Ice age]]", ''Notices of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society'', 1876.</ref> He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian [[glaciology|glaciologist]] I.A. Zotikov, who wrote his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis on this subject in 1967.<ref name=appeal/>

Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating [[radar imaging]] observations and space-based radar altimetry.

[[File:GISP2 team photo core37.jpeg|thumb|[[Ice core]]s drilled at Vostok Station, which is seen in the background]]
Researchers working at Vostok Station produced one of the world's longest [[ice core]]s in 1998. A joint Russian, French, and United States team drilled and analyzed the core, which is {{convert|3623|m|ft|sp=us}} long. Ice samples from cores drilled close to the top of the lake have been assessed to be as old as 420,000&nbsp;years. The assumption is that the lake has been sealed from the surface since the ice sheet formed, 15 million years ago.

From this core, specifically from ice that is thought to have formed from lake water freezing onto the base of the ice sheet, [[extremophile|extremophile microbes]] were found, suggesting that the lake water supports life. Scientists suggested that the lake could possess a unique habitat for ancient [[bacteria]] with an isolated microbial [[gene pool]] containing characteristics developed perhaps 500,000&nbsp;years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Priscu JC, Adams EE, Lyons WB, Voytek MA, Mogk DW, Brown RL, McKay CP, Takacs CD, Welch KA, Wolf CF, Kirshtein JD, Avci R|title=Geomicrobiology of subglacial ice above Lake Vostok, Antarctica|journal=Science|volume=286|issue=5447|pages=2141<U+2013>4|year=1999|pmid=10591642|doi=10.1126/science.286.5447.2141}}</ref>

[[File:Lake Vostok drill 2011.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's cross-section of Lake Vostok's drilling]]
In January 2011, the head of the Russian Antarctic Expedition, Valery Lukin, announced that his team had only {{Convert|50|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} of ice left to drill in order to reach the water.<ref name='January 2011'/> The researchers then switched to a new thermal drill head with a "clean" [[silicone oil]] fluid to drill the rest of the way.<ref>{{cite news|first=L|last=Edwards|title=Russians hope to reach Lake Vostok for the first time soon|date=10 January 2011|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-01-russians-lake-vostok.html|work=Physorg|accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref> Instead of drilling all the way into the water, they said they would stop just above it when a sensor on the thermal drill detected free water. At that point, the drill was to be stopped and extracted from the bore hole.  Removal of the drill would lower the pressure beneath it, drawing water into the hole to be left to freeze, creating a plug of ice in the bottom of the hole.<ref>Vasiliev et al., 2011, ''Twenty years of drilling the deepest hole in ice'', Scientific Drilling, '''11''', 41-45, {{doi|10.2204/iodp.sd.11.05.2011}}</ref> Drilling stopped on 5 February 2011 at a depth of {{convert|3,720|m|ft|sp=us}} so that the research team could make it off the ice before the beginning of the Antarctic winter season.

By plan, the following summer, the team was to drill down again to take a sample of that ice and analyze it.<ref name='January 2011'/><ref name='Nature 469'>[http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110117/full/469275a.html Race against time for raiders of the lost lake] (17 January 2011) ''Nature'' 469, 275 {{doi|10.1038/469275a}}</ref> The Russians resumed drilling into the lake in January 2012 and reached the upper surface of the water in 6 February 2012.<ref name= Kaufman/><ref>{{cite news|first=D|last=Cressey|title=<U+2018>Too soon<U+2019> to confirm success of Antarctic lake drilling|date=7 February 2012|url=http://www.nature.com/news/too-soon-to-confirm-success-of-antarctic-lake-drilling-1.9986|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref>

In the Antarctic summer of 2012<U+2013>13, the Russian team also plans to send an underwater robot into the lake to collect water samples and sediments from the bottom. Sediments on its floor should give clues to its long-term climate, and [[isotope]]s in its water are expected to help [[Glaciology|glaciologists]] determine how and when subglacial lakes such as Lake Vostok form. An environmental assessment of the plan will be submitted at the Antarctic Treaty's consultative meeting in May 2012.<ref name='Nature 469'/>

==Controversy==
The drilling project has been opposed by some [[Environmental movement|environmental groups]] and scientists that have argued that [[hot-water drilling]] would have a more limited [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]].<ref name='Discovery News'>{{cite news|first=E|last=Niiler|title=Antarctic Drilling Plan Raises Concerns|date=9 February 2011|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/lake-vostok-antarctica-environment-110209.html|work=Discovery News|accessdate=10 February 2011}}</ref> The main concern is concern that the lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. The Russians explained that hot-water drilling would require more power than they could generate at their remote camp.<ref name='Discovery News'/> Scientists of the [[United States National Research Council]] have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/subglacial_lakes_final.pdf|title=Exploration of Antarctic Subglacial|accessdate=9 February 2011|year=2007|work=National Academy of Sciences|publisher=National Research Council}}</ref> 

The original drilling technique employed by the Russians involved the use of Freon and kerosene to lubricate the borehole and prevent it from collapsing and freezing over; 60&nbsp;tons of these chemicals have been used thus far on the ice above Lake Vostok.<ref name=Morton/> Other countries, particularly the United States and Britain, have failed to persuade the Russians not to pierce to the lake until cleaner technologies such as hot-water drilling are available.<ref name='sydney'>{{cite news|first=A|last=Darby|title=Antarctic Treaty no match for national pride|date=8 February 2011|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/antarctic-treaty-no-match-for-national-pride-20110209-1ameh.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref> Though the Russians claim to have improved their operations, they continue to use the same borehole, which has already been filled with kerosene.<ref name='ASOC'>{{cite web|url=http://www.asoc.org/issues-and-advocacy/antarctic-environmental-protection/lake-vostok|title=Antarctica's Lake Vostok Controversy|accessdate=10 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=[[Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition]]}}</ref> According to the head of Russian Antarctic Expeditions, Valery Lukin, new equipment was developed by researchers at the [[St. Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute]] that would ensure the lake remains uncontaminated upon intrusion.<ref name='January 2011'/> Lukin has repeatedly reassured other signatory nations to the Antarctic Treaty System that the drilling will not affect the lake, arguing that on breakthrough, water will rush up the borehole, freeze, and seal the chemical fluids out.

Some environmentalist groups remain unconvinced by these arguments. The [[Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition]] has argued that this manner of drilling is a profoundly misguided step which endangers Lake Vostok itself and also other subglacial lakes in Antarctica (which some scientists are convinced are inter-linked with Lake Vostok).<ref name=appeal/> The coalition has asserted that "it would be far preferable to join with other countries to penetrate a smaller and more isolated lake before re-examining whether penetration of Lake Vostok is environmentally defensible. If we are wise, the Lake will be allowed to reveal its secrets in due course."<ref name=appeal/>
