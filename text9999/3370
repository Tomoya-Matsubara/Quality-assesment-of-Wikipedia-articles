'''World War II''', or the '''Second World War'''<ref>{{ cite web |quote=Official military histories in Commonwealth and Western nations refer to the conflict as the Second World War (e.g. [[C.P. Stacey]]'s ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War''), while the United States' official histories refer to the conflict as World War II, spoken "World War Two". English translations of the official histories of other nations also tend to resolve into English as Second World War, for example ''Zweiter Weltkrieg'' in German. Non-English-language use typically translates to Second World War, for instance the Spanish ''Segunda Guerra mundial'' and the French ''Seconde Guerre mondiale''. "Official" usage of these terms is giving way to popular usage and the two terms are becoming interchangeable even in formal military history. The term "Second World War" was originally coined in the 1920s. In 1928, [[US Secretary of State]] [[Frank B. Kellogg]] advocated his treaty "for the renunciation of war" (known as the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]]) as being a "practical guarantee against a second world war". The term came into widespread use as soon as the war began in 1939|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=June 12, 1939|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762392,00.html |title=War Machines|accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> (often abbreviated '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), was a global [[War|military conflict]] between 1939 and 1945, which involved [[Participants in World War II|most of the world's nations]], including all [[great power]]s, organised into two opposing military alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million military personnel mobilised.  In a state of "[[total war]]," the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Over [[World War II casualties|seventy million people]], the majority civilians, were killed, making it [[List of wars and disasters by death toll|the deadliest conflict]] in [[History of the world|human history]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Illustrated History of World War Two: An Authoritative Account of the Deadliest Conflict in Human History with Analysis of Decisive Encounters and Landmark Engagements|first=Donald |last=Sommerville|publisher=Lorenz Books|date=December 14, 2008|page=5|isbn=0754818985}}</ref>

The start of the war is generally held to be September 1, 1939, with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and subsequent [[declaration of war|declarations of war]] on Germany by most of the countries in the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], and by [[French Third Republic|France]].

In 1945, the war ended in a victory for the Allies. The [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] subsequently emerged as the world's two [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the [[Cold War]] which lasted for the next 46 years. The [[United Nations]] was formed in the hope of preventing another world conflict. The acceptance of the principle of [[self-determination]] accelerated [[decolonization]] movements in Asia and Africa, while [[Western Europe]] itself began moving toward [[European integration|integration]].

Others follow [[A. J. P. Taylor]], who held that there was a simultaneous Sino-Japanese War in East Asia, and a Second European War in Europe and her colonies.

The exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It has been suggested that the war ended at the armistice of August 14, 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (September 2, 1945); in some European histories, it ended on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]] (May 8, 1945). The [[Treaty of San Francisco|Treaty of Peace with Japan]] was not signed until 1951.<ref>{{cite book|first= Shiraishi|last= Masaya |title=Japanese relations with Vietnam, 1951<U+2013>1987|publisher= SEAP Publications|year= 1990|isbn= 0877271224 |page=4}}</ref>

==Background==

A variety of events led to the escalation of hostilities between the Axis and Allied powers prior to the start of the war.

The [[Russian Civil War]] led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]].

The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in [[China]] launched a [[Northern Expedition (1926<U+2013>1927)|unification campaign]] against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese communist]] allies.<ref>{{cite book|last= Preston |first=Peter|title='Pacific Asia in the global system: an introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell|year=1998|isbn= 0631202382|page= 104|publisher= Blackwell|location= Oxford}}</ref> In 1931, an [[Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]], which had long sought influence in China<ref>{{cite book|first1=Ramon|last1=Myers|first2=Mark|last2=Peattie|title=The Japanese Colonial Empire, 1895<U+2013>1945|publisher= [[Princeton University Press]]|year=1987|isbn=0691102228|page= 458}}</ref> as the first step of its [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as justification to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invade Manchuria]] and established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].<ref name=Mukden>{{cite book

[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, became the [[Hitler's rise to power|Chancellor of Germany in 1933]].

Hoping to contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]]. The Soviet Union, concerned due to [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe]], wrote a treaty of mutual assistance with France.

[[File:Truppe italiane in viaggio verso l'Eritrea.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Italian soldiers on their way to Eritrea, 1935.]]
The Second Italo<U+2013>Abyssinian War was a brief [[colonial war]] that started in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war was fought between the [[armed forces]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia'') and the armed forces of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]). The war resulted in the [[military occupation]] of Ethiopia and its [[annexation]] into the newly created colony of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI); in addition, it exposed the inherent weakness of the League of Nations. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated the League's own [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations|Article X]].<ref name=Barker-159>{{cite book|last=Barker|first=A.

===Japanese invasion of China===
{{main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Chinese machine gun nest in the [[Battle of Shanghai]].]]
In July 1937, Japan captured the former imperial capital of [[Beiping]] after instigating the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], which culminated in the [[Japan]]ese campaign to invade all of [[Republic of China|China]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fairbank|first1=John King|last2=Feuerwerker|first2=Albert|last3=Twitchett|first3=Denis Crispin|title=The Cambridge history of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=0521243386|pages=547<U+2013>551}}</ref> The Soviets quickly signed a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact with China]] to lend [[materiel]] support, effectively ending China's prior [[Sino-German cooperation (1911<U+2013>1941)|cooperation with Germany]]. [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] deployed his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|best army]] to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]], but after 3 month of fighting [[Shanghai]] fell. The Japanese continue to push the Chinese forces back, [[Battle of Nanjing|capturing the capital Nanjing]] in December 1937 and committed the [[Nanking Massacre]]. 

In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by [[1938 Yellow River flood|flooding the Yellow River]]; although this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at [[Wuhan]], the [[Battle of Wuhan|city was taken]] by October.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fairbank|first1=John King|last2=Feuerwerker|first2=Albert|last3=Twitchett|first3=Denis Crispin|title=The Cambridge history of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=0521243386|page=566}}</ref> However, Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve, instead the Chinese government relocated to [[Chongqing]] to contiunue their resistance.

On July 29, 1938, the Japanese invaded the USSR and were checked at the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]]. Although the battle was a Soviet victory, the Japanese dismissed it as an inconclusive draw, and on May 11, 1939 decided to move the Japanese-Mongolian border up to the Khalkin Gol River by force. Stalin replaced the former Soviet commander with [[Zhukov]] on [[Timoshenko]]'s advice. Zhukov, along with reinforcements sent from [[Moscow]], checked the Japanese assault on [[Mongolia]] and handed the Japanese [[Kwangtung Army]] their first major defeat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coox|first=Alvin D.|title=Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=1990|page=189|isbn=0804718350}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Amnon|last=Sella|title=Khalkhin-Gol: The Forgotten War|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=18|issue=4|date=October 1983|pages=651<U+2013>87}}</ref>

These two battles were significant in that they persuaded the Japanese Government to favor the anti-American plan proposed by the Japanese Navy, this ensured that the USSR would only be engaged in single front warfare against Nazi Germany. They also prevented the sacking of experienced Soviet military leaders such as Zhukov and [[Yakovlev]], who would later play a vital role in the [[battle of Moscow|defence of Moscow]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Chaney|first=Otto Preston|title=Zhukov|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1996|page=76|isbn=0806128070}}</ref>

[[File:World War II Casualties2.svg|left|475px|World War II deaths]]

Estimates for the total casualties of the war vary, due to the fact that many deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about [[Battle casualties of World War II|20 million soldiers]] and 40 million civilians.<ref name="WWII: C&C">{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Prof. Joseph V|title= World War II: Combatants and Casualties (1937<U+2014> 1945) |url=http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob62.html|work=Obee's History Page|publisher=John Jay College of Criminal Justice|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=White|title=Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Second|work=Historical Atlas of the Twentieth Century|publisher=Matthew White's Homepage|accessdate= 2007-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|publisher=secondworldwar.co.uk|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>
Many civilians died because of [[Infectious disease|disease]], [[starvation]], [[List of massacres|massacres]], [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]] and deliberate [[genocide]]. The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war, almost half of all World War II deaths.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead| accessdate= 2009-12-07 | work=BBC News | date=May 9, 2005}}</ref> 

Of the total deaths in World War II, approximately 85 percent were on the Allied side (mostly Soviet and Chinese) and 15 percent were on the Axis side. One estimate is that 12 million civilians died in Nazi concentration camps,<ref>{{cite web | author=Florida Center for Instructional Technology|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/Holocaust/people/victims.htm|title=Victims|work=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust|publisher=[[University of South Florida]]|year=2005|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> 1.5 million by bombs, 7 million in Europe from other causes, and 7.5 million in China from other causes.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

Many of these deaths were a result of genocidal actions committed in Axis-occupied territories and other war crimes [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|committed by German]] as well as [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese forces]]. The most notorious of German atrocities was [[The Holocaust]], the systematic genocide of [[Jew]]s in territories controlled by Germany and its allies. 

The Nazis also targeted other groups, including the [[Romani people|Roma]] (targeted in the [[Porajmos]]), [[Slav]]s, and [[History of gay men in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|gay men]], exterminating an estimated five million additional people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Todd|first=Allan|title=The Modern World|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0199134251|page=121}}</ref> The targets of the Axis-aligned Croatian [[Usta<U+0161>e]] regime were mostly [[Serbs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Jasenovac.html|title=Jasenovac|work=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher [[gross domestic product]] than the European Axis (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.<ref name="6Econ3">{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Mark|title=The Economics of World War II: Six Great Powers in International Comparison|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521785030|page=3}}</ref> In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.<ref name="6Econ3"/>

In Europe, occupation came under two very different forms. In Western, Northern and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion [[German Reichsmark|reichmarks]] (27.8 billion US Dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liberman|first=Peter|title=Does Conquest Pay?: The Exploitation of Occupied Industrial Societies|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1998|isbn=0691002428|page=42}}</ref> Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.<ref>{{cite book|last=Milward|first=Alan S|title=War, Economy, and Society, 1939<U+2013>1945|publisher=University of California Press|year=1979|isbn=0520039424|page=138}}</ref>

{{Main|Technology during World War II}}

During the war, aircraft continued their roles of reconnaissance, [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s and ground-support from World War I, though each area was advanced considerably. Two important additional roles for aircraft were those of the [[airlift]], the capability to quickly move high-priority supplies, equipment and personnel, albeit in limited quantities;<ref name="EncWWII_76">{{cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=76|isbn=1576079996}}</ref> and of [[strategic bombing]], the targeted use of bombs against civilian areas in the hopes of hampering enemy industry and morale.<ref>{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Alan J.|title=The Strategic Bombing of Germany, 1940<U+2013>1945|publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1992|page=217|isbn= 0275943194}}</ref> [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also continued to advance, including key defences such as [[radar]] and greatly improved anti-aircraft artillery, such as the German [[88 mm gun]]. [[Jet aircraft]] saw their first limited operational use during World War II, and though their late introduction and limited numbers meant that they had no real impact during the war itself, the few which saw active service pioneered a mass-shift to their usage following the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sauvain|first=Philip|title=Key Themes of the Twentieth Century: Teacher's Guide|page=128|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |year= 2005 |isbn=1405132183}}</ref>

At sea, while advances were made in almost all aspects of naval warfare, the two primary areas of development were focused around aircraft carriers and submarines.

The British focused development on [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[anti-submarine weapon|weaponry]] and tactics, such as [[sonar]] and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII submarine]] and [[Wolf pack]] tactics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burcher|first=Roy|last=Rydill|first=Louis|title=Concepts in Submarine Design|page=16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052155926X|year=1995}}</ref> Gradually, continually improving Allied technologies such as the [[Leigh light]], [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]], [[Squid (weapon)|squid]], and [[Mark 24 FIDO Torpedo|homing torpedoes]] proved victorious.

Land warfare changed drastically from the static front lines predominating in World War I to become much more fluid and mobile. An important change was the concept of [[combined arms]] warfare, wherein tight coordination was sought between the various elements of military forces; the [[tank]], which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon of these forces during the second.<ref name="EncWWII_125">{{cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=125|isbn=1576079996}}</ref> In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced in all areas then it had been during World War I,<ref>{{cite book|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor Nevitt|title=The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|isbn=0710601239|year=1982|page=231}}</ref> and [[Tanks in World War II|advances continued throughout the war]] in increasing speed, armour and firepower.

The United States became the first country to arm its soldiers with a [[semi-automatic rifle]], in this case the [[M-1 Garand]]. Some of the primary advances though, were the widespread incorporation of portable [[machine gun]]s, a notable example being the German [[MG42]], and various [[submachine gun]]s which were well suited to close-quarters combat in urban and jungle settings.<ref name="Comp_221" /> The [[assault rifle]], a late war development which incorporated many of the best features of the [[rifle]] and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for nearly all armed forces.<ref>{{cite web |title=Infantry Weapons Of World War 2 |url=http://greyfalcon.us/Infantry%20Weapons%20Of%20World%20War%202.htm |publisher=Grey Falcon (Black Sun) |accessdate=2009-11-14|quote=These all-purpose guns were developed and used by the German army in the 2nd half of World War 2 as a result of studies which showed that the ordinary rifle's long range is much longer than needed, since the soldiers almost always fired at enemies closer than half of its effective range.
