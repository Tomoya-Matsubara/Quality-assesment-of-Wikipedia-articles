==Personal details==
Serzh Sargsyan was born on June 30, 1954 in [[Stepanakert]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] (then the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] within [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]]).  He was admitted to [[Yerevan State University]] in 1971, served in the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] during 1971-72, and graduated from the Philological Department of Yerevan State University in 1979.  In 1983, he married his wife, [[Rita Sargsyan|Rita]].  They have two daughters, Anush and Satenik, and one granddaughter, Mariam.<ref name="official-bio" /> He is the chairman of the Chess Federation of Armenia.

==Early career==
Sargsyan's career began in 1975 at the Electrical Devices Factory in [[Yerevan]]<ref name="repub-bio">[http://www.hhk.am/eng/persons/serge_sargsyan.html Republican party biography of Serzh Sargsyan]</ref>, where he worked as a metal turner until 1979 when he became head of the Stepanakert City Communist Party Youth Association Committee.  Then served as second secretary, first secretary, the Stepanakert City Committee Propaganda Division Head, the Nagorno-Karabakh Regional Committee Communist Organizations' Unit Instructor, and finally as the assistant to [[Genrikh Poghosyan]], the First Secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh Regional Committee.<ref name="official-bio" /> 

As tensions rose over Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Sargsyan became chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Self-Defense Forces Committee and was subsequently elected to the Supreme Council of [[Armenia]] in 1990.<ref name="repub-bio" />  He organized several battles in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and is considered to be one of the founders of Nagorno-Karabakh's and Armenia's armed forces. He became the Armenian defense minister in 1993, head of Armenian state security department in 1995 and minister of national security in 1996.  In 1999, he became [[Robert Kocharyan]]'s chief of staff, then secretary of the national security council, defense minister, and prime minister in 2007.<ref name="official-bio" />

==2008 presidential election==
Sargsyan, with President Kocharyan's backing, was viewed as the strongest contender for the post of the President of Armenia in the [[Armenian presidential election, 2008|February 2008 presidential election]]. Full provisional results showed him winning about 53% of the vote, a first round majority, well ahead of second place candidate [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]].<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/20/content_7637405.htm "Sargsyan wins Armenian presidential race"], Xinhua, February 20, 2008.</ref> Ter-Petrossian's supporters, disputing the official results, held [[2008 Armenian presidential election protests|large protests]] in Yerevan for over a week following the election, until they were violently broken up by police on March 1; ten people were killed, and a state of emergency was imposed for 20 days, ending on March 20, 2008.<ref name=Sworn/>

==Presidency==
Serzh Sargsyan was sworn in as President inside the Yerevan Opera House on April 9. Referring to the "painful events" that followed the election, he "urge[d] everybody to look forward, together, to seek and find the way for reconciliation, development, and future of Armenia."<ref name=Sworn/> He appointed [[Tigran Sargsyan]], who had been the Chairman of the Central Bank and is not a member of a political party, as Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news

===Foreign policy===
Sargsyan initially stated that he will continue Armenia's policy towards Turkey, to normalize relations without any preconditions while continuing to strive for international recognition of the 1915 [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite news 
  | title = Sarkisian Reaffirms Armenian Policy On Turkey

Moreover, with his acceptation of the current Turkish-Armenian border, he neglected Armenian demands to [[Western Armenia]] supported by the [[Treaty of Sevres]]. He also stated that "Armenia's possible recognition of [[Kosovo]]'s independence will not strain the Armenian-[[Russia]]n relations" but also noted that "Kosovo recognition issue needs serious discussion ... Armenia has always been an adherent to the right of nations to self-determination and in this aspect we welcome Kosovo's independence."<ref>[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=25331 "Armenia doesn<U+2019>t view Kosovo as precedent"], ''PanArmenian.net'', 12 March 2008. Link accessed 2008-03-12.</ref>

In his address he referenced the [[2008 South Ossetia war|2008 South Ossetia conflict]] and emphasized the need for the United Nations to help bring peaceful resolution to armed conflicts around the world, including the one in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. He also mentioned how Azerbaijan's military buildup along with increasing war rhetoric and threats risked causing renewed problems in the [[South Caucasus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement by President Serzh Sargsyan at the General Debate of the 63 rd session of the general assembly|url=http://www.president.am/events/statements/eng/?id=19|work=President.am|date=2008-09-25|accessdate=2009-04-11 }}</ref>
