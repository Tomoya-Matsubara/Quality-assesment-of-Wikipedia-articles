'''Kurz and Allison''' were a major publisher of [[chromolithographs]] in the late 19th century. Based at 267-269 Wabash Avenue in [[Chicago]], they built their reputation on large prints published in the mid-1880's depicting battles of the [[American Civil War]]. This was a period of recollection among veterans, and the company was trying to capitalise of this sentiment. In all, a set of thirty-six battle scenes were published from designs by Louis Kurz (1835-1921)<ref>{{cite journal |year=1922 |journal=Journal of the Illinois Historical Society |volume=14  |pages=208 }}</ref>, himself a veteran of the war. Kurz, a native of [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], had emigrated to the United States in 1848.<ref name="Neely4">{{cite book |title=The Union Image: Popular Prints of the Civil War North |last1=Neely |first1=Mark E |last2=Holzer |first2=Harold  |year=2000 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press  |isbn=0807825107 |page=210 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4rWdS66EP4C&pg=PA212&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&client=firefox-a&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> While the prints were highly inaccurate<ref>{{Cite book | last = Cannan | first = John | title =The Antietam Campaign: August-september 1862 | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1997| pages = 24-27| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=-OA0jQPRVMsC&pg=PA24&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&client=firefox-a&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false| isbn =0938289918|quote=One wonders if veterans looked at these prints with grim amusement or hateful disgust at the misrepresentation of the way Kurz and Allison portrayed their exploits.}}</ref> and considered naive fantasies like [[Currier and Ives]] prints<ref>{{cite book |title=The Confederate Image: Prints of the Lost Cause |first1=Mark E. |last1=Neely |first2=Harold |last2=Holzer |first3=Gabor S. |last3=Boritt  |year=1987 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-4905-7 |page=219 |quote=...The ridiculous fantasies of battle art churned out after the war by Chicago's Kurz and Allison. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VWcKEtedGHIC&pg=PA179&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&client=firefox-a&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>, they were still sought after. They did not pretend to mirror the actual events but rather attempted to tap people's patriotic emotions. When the [[Spanish-American War]] broke out in 1898, the company created several large prints of the major battles and of the subsequent campaign of the [[Philippine-American War]]. Later conflicts such as the [[Russo-Japanese War]] were also illustrated by the company.

==Formation of the firm==
Louis Kurz first worked as a lithographer in Milwaukee, together with Henry Sifert.<ref name="Neely4" />  After the Civil War, he was one of the founders of the [[Chicago Lithographing Company]].<ref name="Neely4" /><ref name="Merrill">{{cite book |title=German-American Artists in Early Milwaukee: a Biographical Dictionary |first=Peter C. |last=Merrill  |year=1997 |publisher=Max Kade Institute  |isbn=0924119012 |page=59 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l93pAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&lr=&client=firefox-a&cd=19 |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>  He worked there until the company was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.<ref name="Neely4" /><ref name="Marzio">{{cite book |title=The Democratic Art: Pictures for a 19th-century America : Chromolithography, 1840-1900  |last=Marzio  |first=Peter C. |year=1979 |publisher=Amon Carter Museum of Western Art  |isbn=0879232900 |page=259 }}</ref>  He then returned to Milwaukee, and started the American Oleograph Comapny.<ref name="Neely4" /><ref name="Marzio" />  He moved back to Chicago in 1878, where in 1880 he became a partner in the newly founded firm of Kurz and Allison.<ref name="Neely4" /><ref name="Merrill" /> Alexander Allison probably provided financial backing.<ref name="Neely4" />

==Civil War print series==
In 1884 Kurz and Allison published a single print of the battle of Gettysburg inspired by [[Paul Philippoteaux]]'s popular [[Gettysburg Cyclorama|cyclorama]] on the same subject, and probably intended to profit by the popularity of the cyclorama.<ref name="Neely1">{{cite book |title=The Union Image: Popular Prints of the Civil War North |last1=Neely |first1=Mark E |last2=Holzer |first2=Harold  |year=2000 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press  |isbn=0807825107 |page=212 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4rWdS66EP4C&pg=PA212&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&client=firefox-a&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> (The cyclorama was first exhibited in Chicago in 1883, where Kurz then was living.<ref name="Neely1" />) According to Neely and Holzeer (2000) "The influence of the Gettysburg cyclorama on the Kurz and Alison print is readily recognizable.... The print openly copied vignettes from the painting and in at least one instance perpetuated a historical error..."<ref name="Neely1" />

In June 1886 [[Louis Prang]] published a series of prints under the title ''Prang's War Pictures''.<ref name="Neely2">{{cite book |title=The Union Image: Popular Prints of the Civil War North |last1=Neely |first1=Mark E |last2=Holzer |first2=Harold  |year=2000 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press  |isbn=0807825107 |pages=212-217 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4rWdS66EP4C&pg=PA212&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&client=firefox-a&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> (They may well have been available for purchase individually some months earlier.<ref name="Neely2" />) Shortly thereafter  Kurz and Allison reissued their print of the Battle of Gettysburg and designed and issued additional prints in the same format (28 by 22 inches).<ref name="Neely2" /> Three such prints were issued in 1886, three in 1887, seven in 1888, six in 1889, four in 1890, six in 1891, one in 1891, four in 1892, and one in 1893.<ref name="Neely1" /> According to Neely and Holzeer (2000) Kurz and Alison, although inspired by Prang's work, did not imitate his artistic aspirtions. "Kurz and Alison remained true to the popular tradition in lithography embodied in the work of Currier and Ives; Prang was aiming higher."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Union Image: Popular Prints of the Civil War North |last1=Neely |first1=Mark E |last2=Holzer |first2=Harold  |year=2000 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press  |isbn=0807825107 |page=214 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4rWdS66EP4C&pg=PA212&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&client=firefox-a&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> Neely and Holzeer (2000) emphasize Kurz and Allison's "antiphotographic" adherence to the traditions of popular lithography and the artistic styles of Civil War publications, in contrast to Prang's more modern style.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Union Image: Popular Prints of the Civil War North |last1=Neely |first1=Mark E |last2=Holzer |first2=Harold  |year=2000 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press  |isbn=0807825107 |page=218 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4rWdS66EP4C&pg=PA212&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&client=firefox-a&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>

Several of the Kurz and Alison Civil War prints featured Black soldiers, particularly ''Storming Fort Wagner'' (1890) and ''The Fort Pillow Massacre'' (1893), which was unusual at the time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Causes Won, Lost, and Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know about the Civil War  |last=Gallagher |first=Gary W.  |year=2008 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0807832066 |page=186}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Winter |first=William C.   |year=2001 |title=War for the Parlor:The Kurz and Allison Lithographs  |journal=Gateway Heritage: Quarterly Journal of the Missouri Historical Society |volume=22 |page=20 }}</ref>

==Other work==
Kurz and Allison also issued a series of "family prints" which showed such Civil War figures as [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[James A Garfield]] in domestic settings, surrounded by their families.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Confederate Image: Prints of the Lost Cause |first1=Mark E. |last1=Neely |first2=Harold |last2=Holzer |first3=Gabor S. |last3=Boritt  |year=1987 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-4905-7 |page=182  |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VWcKEtedGHIC&pg=PA179&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>

The firm also produced a sizable number of black and white lithographs on religious subjects. These were marketed to localized communities with ethnic identities, often separated from their compatriots, often in the West.<ref name="Coulter">{{cite book |title=New Mexican Tinwork, 1840-1940 |first1=Lane |last1=Coulter |first2=Maurice |last2=Dixon, Jr.  |year=1990 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=978-0826315250 |page=16 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hBOpanuyW6oC&pg=PA16&dq=%22Kurz+and+Allison%22&lr=&cd=12#v=onepage&q=%22Kurz%20and%20Allison%22&f=false |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> Many of the firm's prints were reproduced in New Mexican tinwork.<ref name="Coulter" />

==Later reputation==
"Prints depicting the Civil War battles by Kurz and Allison are among the most sought after collectibles of Civil War enthusiasts." according to the Martin Art Gallery, Muhlenberg College.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muhlenberg.edu/cultural/gallery/masterpieces/kurz.html |title=Battle of Gettysburg  |publisher=Martin Art Gallery, Muhlenberg College |accessdate=16 December 2009}}</ref> In spite of their lack of historical accuracy, Kurz and Allison prints (or details from them) are still used as book covers and iconic images of the Civil War.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History  |first1=David J. |last1=Coles |first2=David Stephen |last2=Heidler |first3=Jeanne T. |last3=Heidler |first4=James M. |last4=McPherson   |year=2002 |publisher=W.W.
