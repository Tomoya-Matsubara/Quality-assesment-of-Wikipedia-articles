'''American International Group, Inc.''' {{New York Stock Exchange|AIG}}, also known as '''AIG''', is an American [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] insurance corporation. Its corporate headquarters is reported as 180 Maiden Lane in New York City (was formerly in the [[American International Building]] in New York City). The British headquarters office is on [[Fenchurch Street]] in London, continental Europe operations are based in [[La D<U+00E9>fense]], Paris, and its Asian headquarters office is in Hong Kong. According to the 2011 [[Forbes]] Global 2000 list, AIG was the 29th-largest public company in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The World's Biggest Public Companies|url=http://www.forbes.com/global2000/|work=Forbes|accessdate=June 7, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604160513/http://www.forbes.com/global2000/| archivedate= June 04 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=AIG|url=http://www.forbes.com/companies/american-intl-group/|work=Forbes|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> It was listed on the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] from April 8, 2004 to September 22, 2008.

AIG suffered from a [[liquidity crisis]] when its credit ratings were downgraded below "AA" levels in September 2008. The United States [[Federal Reserve Bank]] on September 16, 2008 created an $85&nbsp;billion credit facility to enable the company to meet increased collateral obligations consequent to the credit rating downgrade, in exchange for the issuance of a stock [[Warrant (finance)|warrant]] to the Federal Reserve Bank for 79.9% of the equity of AIG. The Federal Reserve Bank and the United States Treasury by May 2009 had increased the potential financial support to AIG, with the support of an investment of as much as $70&nbsp;billion, a $60&nbsp;billion credit line and $52.5&nbsp;billion to buy mortgage-based assets owned or guaranteed by AIG, increasing the total amount available to as much as $182.5&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Son |first=Hugh |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aaog3i4yUopo&refer=us |title=AIG<U+2019>s Trustees Shun <U+2018>Shadow Board,<U+2019> Seek Directors (Update2) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20090302a.htm |title=U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Board Announce Participation in AIG Restructuring Plan |publisher=Federal Reserve Board |accessdate=July 11, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110710201140/http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20090302a.htm| archivedate= July 10, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:AIG New York building at dusk.jpg|thumb|right|The American International Building in [[Lower Manhattan]].]]

AIG history dates back to 1919, when [[Cornelius Vander Starr]] established an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Starr was the first Westerner in Shanghai to sell insurance to the Chinese, which he continued to do until AIG left China in early 1939<U+2014>as [[Mao Zedong]] led the advance of the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]] on Shanghai.<ref>{{cite book | title= Current Biography Yearbook | url= http://books.google.com/?id=P4oYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22AIG+abandoned+China+completely+in+1949%22 | last= Thompson | first= Clifford | coauthors= Block, Maxine; Moritz, Charles; Rothe, Anna Herthe; Candee, Marjorie Dent | year= 1941 | page= 247 | publisher=[[H.

In 1962, Starr gave management of the company's lagging U.S. holdings to [[Maurice R. Greenberg|Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg]], who shifted its focus from personal insurance to high-margin corporate coverage. Greenberg focused on selling insurance through independent brokers rather than agents to eliminate agent salaries. Using brokers, AIG could price insurance according to its potential return even if it suffered decreased sales of certain products for great lengths of time with very little extra expense. In 1968, Starr named Greenberg his successor. The company went public in 1969.<ref>{{cite book | title= Hoover's Handbook of American Business | url= http://books.google.com/?id=0okYAAAAIAAJ&q=%22AIG+went+public+in+1969%22 | edition= 9th | year= 1999 | page= 134 | publisher=[[Hoover's|Hoover's Business Press]] | location= Austin, TX | isbn= 978-1-57311-045-7 | accessdate=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>

Beginning in 2005, AIG became embroiled in a series of fraud investigations conducted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]], and [[New York State Attorney General]]'s Office.

=== Chronology of September 2008 liquidity crisis ===
On September 16, 2008, AIG suffered a [[credit crunch|liquidity crisis]] following the downgrade of its [[credit rating]]. Industry practice permits firms with the highest credit ratings to enter [[swap (finance)|swap]]s without depositing collateral with their trading counter-parties. When its credit rating was downgraded, the company was required to post additional collateral with its trading counter-parties, and this led to an AIG liquidity crisis. AIG's London unit sold credit protection in the form of [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs) on [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) that had by that time declined in value.<ref name="NyTimes-Gretchen-2008-09-27">

Just before the bailout by the US Federal Reserve, AIG former CEO Maurice (Hank) Greenberg sent an impassioned letter to AIG CEO Robert B. Willumstad offering his assistance in any way possible, [[Carbon copy|ccing]] the Board of Directors. His offer was rebuffed.<ref name=Letter-to-the-CEO-and-board>
Many blame the financial problems on the legal problems AIG began having as a result of a number of government investigations alleging fraud and other inproprieties which were approved by the office of its then chairman, Maurice Greenberg. These problems placed such a focus on AIG's activities that it created a level of required transparency and fear of getting caught, which many believe forced the company to be less active and willing to cheat its way out of these problems. A manner of doing business it learned with its core activity of denying legitimate insurance claims and then pressuring its insureds, their witnesses and anyone else coming to their support while trying to intimidate judges and insurance commissioners. So who began all this? In May 2001 an insurance claimant and shareholder, Cesar Balbin stepped into the annual shareholders meetings. For the first time ever in the company's history, AIG was publicly accused of criminal and civil racketeering activities including: extortion, blackmale, claims fraud, theft of company equity: it took with it the chairman, billions of dollars and led to a greater transparency and fear that possibly contributed to inaction by many at AIG to participate in its typically less than legal and proper activities required to keep the company afloat.{{cite web |url=https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Image:AIG09162008.pdf |format=PDF|title=Letter from Maurice Greenberg to AIG Ceo and Board of Directors |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 17, 2008 |publisher=WikiLeaks| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080923184309/https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Image:AIG09162008.pdf| archivedate= September 23, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}

===Federal Reserve bailout===
On the evening of September 16, 2008, the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]'s Board of Governors announced that the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] had been authorized to create a 24-month credit-liquidity facility from which AIG could draw up to $85&nbsp;billion. The loan was [[collateral (finance)|collateralized]] by the assets of AIG, including its non-regulated subsidiaries and the stock of "substantially all" of its regulated subsidiaries, and with an interest rate of 850 [[basis point]]s over the three-month [[London Interbank Offered Rate]] (LIBOR) (i.e., LIBOR plus 8.5%). In exchange for the credit facility, the U.S. government received warrants for a 79.9 percent equity stake in AIG, with the right to suspend the payment of dividends to AIG common and preferred shareholders.<ref name="NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16" /><ref name="Federal Reserve-Press Release-2008-09-16" />
The credit facility was created under the auspices of Section 13(3) of the [[Federal Reserve Act]].<ref name="Federal Reserve-Press Release-2008-09-16" /><ref name = "Federal Reserve Act-Section 13" >

AIG's board of directors announced approval of the loan transaction in a press release the same day. The announcement did not comment on the issuance of a warrant for 79.9% of AIG's equity, but the AIG 8-K filing of September 18, 2008, reporting the transaction to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] stated that a warrant for 79.9% of AIG shares had been issued to the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve]].<ref name="NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16">

On September 17, 2008, Federal Reserve Board chair [[Ben Bernanke]] asked Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] join him, to call on members of Congress, to describe the need for a congressionally authorized bailout of the nation's banking system. Weeks later, Congress approved the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].
Bernanke said to Paulson on September 17, "We can<U+2019>t keep doing this. Both because we at the Fed don<U+2019>t have the necessary resources and for reasons of democratic legitimacy, it's important that the Congress come in and take control of the situation."<ref name='New Yorker-Cassidy-2008-12-01'>

As of January 2012, TARP had about $50 billion invested in AIG according to one report. Break even for the government was figured at $28.73 a share ''v.'' then-current share price of about $25.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gordon|first=Marcy|url=http://www.ajc.com/business/report-taxpayers-still-owed-1317741.html|title=Report: Taxpayers still owed $133B from bailout|agency=Associated Press|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=January 26, 2012|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Counterparty controversy===
AIG was required to post additional collateral with many creditors and counter-parties, touching off controversy when over $100&nbsp;billion was paid out to major global financial institutions that had previously received [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]] money. While this money was legally owed to the banks by AIG (under agreements made via [[credit default swap]]s purchased from AIG by the institutions), a number of Congressmen and media members expressed outrage that taxpayer money was going to these banks through AIG.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lanman |first=Scott |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=az3C8NMLBKbY |title=Bloomberg <U+2013> Senators Dodd & Shelby Demand Information |publisher=Bloomberg |date=March 5, 2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> In January, 2010, a document known as "Schedule A <U+2013> List of Derivative Transactions" was released to the public, against the wishes of the [[New York Fed]].

Had AIG been allowed to fail in a controlled manner through bankruptcy, bondholders and derivative counterparties (major banks) would have suffered significant losses, limiting the amount of taxpayer funds directly used. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued: "If a federal agency had [appropriate authority] on September 16, [2008], they could have been used to put AIG into conservatorship or receivership, unwind it slowly, protect policyholders, and impose haircuts on creditors and counterparties as appropriate. That outcome would have been far preferable to the situation we find ourselves in now."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20090324a.htm |title=Bernanke-AIG Testimony |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110607110537/http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20090324a.htm| archivedate= June 07 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Sales of assets===
AIG since September 2008 has marketed its assets to pay off its government loans. A global decline in the valuation of insurance businesses, and the weakening financial condition of potential bidders, has challenged its efforts. If the U.S. government decides to continue to protect the company from falling into bankruptcy, it may have to take the assets itself in exchange for the loans, or offer further direct financial support.<ref>

On March 24, 2009, [[The New York Times]] printed the resignation letter of Jake DeSantis, executive vice president of AIG's financial products unit, to Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of AIG. DeSantis stated he had nothing to do with the credit default swaps, he lost much of his life savings in the form of [[deferred compensation]] invested in the capital of AIG Financial Products; he had agreed to work for an annual salary of $1 out of a sense of duty, that he was assured many times the bonuses would be paid in March 2009, and that he believed he and others were let down by Liddy's lack of support. He also stated he was going to donate his bonus to those suffering from the global economic downturn.<ref>

=== Manchester United Sponsorship ===
AIG was the principal sponsor of English [[association football|football]] club [[Manchester United]] from 2006<U+2013>2010, and as part of the sponsorship deal, its logo was prominently displayed on the front of the club's jerseys and other merchandise. The AIG deal was announced by Manchester United chief executive [[David Gill (executive)|David Gill]] on April 6, 2006, for a British shirt sponsorship record <U+00A3>56.5&nbsp;million, to be paid over four years (<U+00A3>14.1&nbsp;million a year). The deal became the most valuable sponsorship deal in the world in September 2006, after the renegotiation and subsequent degrading of the <U+00A3>15&nbsp;million-a-year deal Italian team [[Juventus]] had with oil firm [[Tamoil]]. During AIG's sponsorship, Manchester United enjoyed one of its most successful periods in history, winning the [[Premier League]] three consecutive years, two [[Football League Cup]]s, and the [[UEFA Champions League]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On January 21, 2009, it was announced that AIG would not be renewing its sponsorship of the club at the end of the deal in May 2010. It is not clear, however, whether or not AIG's agreement to run MU Finance will continue. American risk consulting firm [[Aon Corporation]] was named the club's new principal sponsor on June 3, 2009, with its sponsorship of the club taking effect from the beginning of the 2010<U+2013>11 season. The terms of the deal were not revealed, but it has been reported to be worth approximately <U+00A3>80&nbsp;million over four years.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Share buyback===
Due to the Q3 2011 net loss widened, so on November 3, 2011 the AIG shares has plunged 49 percent year to date. The insurer's board has approved the share buyback of as much as $1 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-04/aig-posts-loss-on-writedowns-tied-to-aia-mortgage-declines.html |title=AIG Posts Loss on Writedowns Tied to AIA, Mortgage Declines |date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

In November 2004, AIG reached a US$126&nbsp;million settlement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] partly resolving a number of regulatory matters, but the company must still cooperate with investigators continuing to probe the sale of a non-traditional insurance product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2004/11/24/47993.htm |title=AIG Forks Up $126&nbsp;million to SEC on PNC Deals |date=November 24, 2004 |publisher=Insurance Journal |accessdate=September 18, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080829181256/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2004/11/24/47993.htm| archivedate= August 29, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On June 11, 2008, three stockholders, collectively owning 4% of the outstanding stock of AIG, delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of AIG seeking to oust CEO Martin Sullivan and make certain other management and Board of Directors changes. This letter was the latest volley in what the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' deemed a "public spat" between the Company's Board and management, on the one hand, and its key stockholders, and former CEO Maurice "Hank" Greenberg on the other hand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=asOzAMceAsiY&refer=us |title=AIG Investors Seek Ouster of Chief Executive Sullivan |date=June 11, 2008 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=July 21, 2008}}</ref>

'''Death Bet'''

Circa 2010 the WSJ reported that a family sued AIG for alleged complicity in a '[[stranger-originated life insurance]]' scheme, whereby AIG managers allegedly welcomed people without an [[insurable interest]] to take out life insurance policies against others. The case involved [[JB Carlson]] and Germaine Tomlinson, and was one of many similar lawsuits in the US at the time.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704847104575532410440815610.html Judge Allows 'Death Bet' Case], Leslie Scism and Mark Maremont, Wall Street Journal, 2010 10 5</ref>

===Accounting fraud claims===
On October 14, 2004 the New York State Office of Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] announced that it had commenced a civil action against [[Marsh & McLennan Companies]] for steering clients to preferred insurers with whom the company maintained lucrative [[bribery|payoff agreements]], and for soliciting rigged bids for insurance contracts from the insurers. The Attorney General announced in a release that two AIG executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with this illegal course of conduct. In early May 2005, AIG restated its financial position and issued a reduction in book value of USD $2.7&nbsp;billion, a 3.3 percent reduction in net worth.

On February 9, 2006, AIG and the New York State Attorney General's office agreed to a settlement in which AIG would pay a fine of $1.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-19.htm |title=AIG to Pay $800&nbsp;million to Settle Securities Fraud Charges by SEC; Over $1.6&nbsp;billion to be Paid to Resolve Federal and New York State Actions |date=February 9, 2006 |publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}</ref>
