The '''Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act''' of 1988 is an act passed by the [[United States Congress]] and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. 

==History==
During the [[1970s]], the American [[Balance of Trade|Trade surplus]] slowly diminished and morphed in to an increasing deficit. As the deficit increased through the 80<U+2019>s, the blame fell on the tariffs placed on American products by foreign countries, and the lack of similar tariffs on imports into the United States. Workers, unions and industry management all called for government action against countries with an [[Comparative advantage|unfair advantage]]. 

The Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness [[Act of Congress|Act]] started as an amendment proposed by [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Dick Gephardt]] (D-MO) to order the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch]] to thoroughly examine trade with countries that have large [[Balance of trade|trade surpluses]] with the United States. If the trade surpluses continued, the offending country would be faced with a bilateral surplus-reduction requirement of 10%. Because of its style of [[zero-sum game]] thought, it is considered by economists to be a modern form of [[Mercantilism]]. The act was signed into law by President Reagan, slightly less strict than proposed, as the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act of [[1988]]. It expired in 1991 and was not renewed until 1994 by President [[Bill Clinton]]. It again expired in 1997 and was renewed once more by Clinton in 1999.
