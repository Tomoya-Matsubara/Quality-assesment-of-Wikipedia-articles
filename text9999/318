== History ==
The airline was established on [[14 September]] [[2001]] and started operations on [[15 May]] [[2002]]. Air Astana leased its first three [[Boeing 737]] aircraft in May 2002. Three [[Boeing 757]]s were added and in [[2004]] five [[Fokker 50]]s were acquired, the latter to largely develop the domestic network. It became the national carrier after the government closed [[Air Kazakhstan]] in February [[2004]] and transferred all route authorities to Air Astana. It is a joint venture owned by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan (51%) and [[BAE Systems]] (49%). It has 1,761 employees (at March [[2007]])<ref name="FI"/>.
