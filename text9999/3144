The '''mummichog''', is a small [[killifish]] found in the eastern [[United States]].

The mummichog spawns on new and full moons in the spring and summer.  Its eggs are laid near the high tide mark and can tolerate long-term exposure to air. The eggs are used in teaching [[embryology]], because it is possible to see the eyes and the beating [[heart]] and follow the different stages of [[ontogenesis]]. These [[fish]] are used to stock otherwise fishless ponds that breed [[mosquito]]s, and within three days the ponds are normally mosquito free.

Because of the extreme hardiness of the species, it is sometimes the only species found in  severely polluted and [[oxygen]]-deprived streams, such as the Elizabeth River in Virginia, and the [[Hackensack River]] and the [[Arthur Kill]] in [[New Jersey]] during the height of the water pollution problem in the [[United States]].  In 1973 the mummichog became the first fish in space when carried on [[Skylab 3]] as part of the biological experiments package later space missions by the U.S., such as [[Bion 3]], have also carried mummichog.
