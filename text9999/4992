The circumstances surrounding the '''[[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]''' on November 22, 1963, spawned suspicions of a conspiracy. These suspicions were mitigated somewhat when an official investigation by the [[Warren Commission]] concluded the following year that there was no conspiracy. Since then, doubts have arisen regarding the Commission's finding that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was responsible for the assassination of Kennedy, and most Americans today believe that others besides Oswald were also involved in the assassination.<ref>Blanton, Dana (June 18, 2004). [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,102511,00.html "Poll: Most Believe 'Cover-Up' of JFK Assassination Facts"]. Fox News.</ref> Critics have argued that the Commission and the government have covered up crucial information pointing to a conspiracy.
 	
Subsequent official investigations confirmed most of the conclusions of the Warren Commission. However, the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, with "...a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President".<ref name="HCSA-S">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html}}</ref><ref name="HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0048a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 65-75.</ref> No person or organization was identified by the HSCA as being a co-conspirator of Oswald.

==Background==
[[File:wanted for treason.jpg|thumb|right|Handbill circulated on November 21, 1963, one day before the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].]]
[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated by gunfire as he traveled in a motorcade in an open-top limousine in [[Dallas, Texas]] on Friday, November 22, 1963 (12:30&nbsp;pm, CST); Texas Governor [[John Connally]] was wounded during the shooting, but survived. Within two hours, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was arrested for the murder of Dallas policeman [[J.D. Tippit]] and arraigned that evening. Shortly after 1:30&nbsp;am, Saturday, Oswald was arraigned for murdering President Kennedy as well.<ref>Warren Commission Report, Chapter 5: Detention and Death of Oswald, [http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-5.html#chronology Chronology]. p. 198.</ref><ref>Tippit murder affidavit: [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0170a.htm text], [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0170b.htm cover].

In 1964, the [[Warren Commission]] concluded that Oswald acted alone and that no credible evidence supported the contention that he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the president.<ref name="WCR-C6">{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

In 1979, the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, but concluded that the Commission's report and the original FBI investigation were seriously flawed. The HSCA concluded that at least four shots were fired with a "high probability" that two gunmen fired at the President, and that a conspiracy was probable.<ref name="HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75"/> The HSCA stated that "the Warren Commission failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President."<ref name="HCSA-S">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html}}</ref>

Kennedy assassination enthusiasts have been described as belonging to "[[conspiracy theorists]]" on one side and "[[debunkers]]" on the other.<ref name="Krajicek"/> The great amount of controversy surrounding the event has led to bitter disputes between those who support the conclusion of the Warren Commission and those who reject it or are critical of the official explanation with each side leveling toward the other accusations of "naivete, cynicism, and selective interpretation of the evidence".<ref name="Perry"/>

Public opinion polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. However, on the question of a government cover-up, different polls show both a minority and majority of Americans who believe the government engaged in one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/article/8008|author=Karlyn Bowman|title=Most Americans Don't Know Much about Fast-Track|publisher=American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research|date=September 4, 1997}}</ref> These same polls also show that there is no agreement on who else may have been involved.

Michael Benson wrote that the Warren Commission received only information supplied to it by the FBI, and that its purpose was to [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] the [[lone gunman theory]].<ref name="Benson">{{cite book |last=Benson|first=Michael |title=Who's Who in the JFK Assassination: An A-to-Z Encyclopedia |year=2003|origyear=1993 |publisher=Citadel Press Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8065-1444-2 |page=xiii |ref=harv}}</ref>

[[Richard Schweiker]], United States senator and member of the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], told author Anthony Summers in 1978, "I believe that the Warren Commission was set up at the time to feed [[pablum|pabulum]] to the American public for reasons not yet known, and that one of the biggest cover-ups in the history of our country occurred at that time.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=243}} On the [[CBS News]] program ''[[Face the Nation]]'', Schweiker also said: "I think the [Warren] report, to those who have studied it closely, has collapsed like a house of cards ... the fatal mistake the Warren Commission made was to not use its own investigators, but instead to rely on the CIA and FBI personnel, which played directly into the hands of senior intelligence officials who directed the cover-up.<ref>Richard Schweiker, speaking on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'', June 27, 1976.</ref>

[[James H. Fetzer]] took issue with a 1998 statement from Federal Judge John R. Tunheim, the Chair of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), who stated that no "[[smoking gun]]s" indicating a conspiracy or cover-up were discovered during their efforts in the early 1990s to declassify documents related to the assassination. Fetzer identified 16 "smoking guns" which he claims prove the official narrative is impossible, and therefore a conspiracy and cover-up occurred. He claims that evidence released by the ARRB substantiates these concerns. These include problems with bullet trajectories, the murder weapon, the ammunition used, inconsistencies between the Warren Commission's account and the autopsy findings, inconsistencies between the autopsy findings and what was reported by witnesses at the scene of the murder, eyewitness accounts that conflict with x-rays taken of the President's body, indications that the diagrams and photos of the President's brain in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] are not the President's, testimony by those who took and processed the autopsy photos that the photos were altered, created, or destroyed, indications that the [[Zapruder film]] had been tampered with, allegations that the Warren Commission's version of events conflicts with news reports from the scene of the murder, an alleged change to the motorcade route which facilitated the assassination, an alleged lax Secret Service and local law enforcement security, and statements by people who claim that they had knowledge of, or participated in, a conspiracy to kill the President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfkresearch.com/prologue.htm|author=James H.

==Allegations of witness tampering, intimidation, and foul play==

===Alleged witness intimidation===
Richard Buyer wrote that many witnesses whose statements pointed to a conspiracy were either ignored or [[witness intimidation|intimidated]] by the Warren Commission.<ref name="Buyer">{{cite book |last=Buyer |first=Richard |title=Why the JFK Assassination Still Matters: The Truth for My Daughter Kennedy and for Generations to Come |year=2009 |publisher=Wheatmark |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=1-60494-193-6 |page=162 |ref=harv}}</ref> In ''JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness'', a 1992 biography of [[Jean Hill]], Bill Sloan wrote that [[Arlen Specter]], assistant counsel for the Warren Commission, attempted to humiliate, discredit, and intimidate Jean Hill into changing her story. Jean Hill also told Sloan that she was abused by Secret Service agents, harassed by the FBI, and was the recipient of death threats.<ref name="Sloan">{{cite book |title=JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness |last=Sloan |first=Bill |coauthors=Jean Hill |year=1992 |publisher=Pelican Publishing Company |location=Gretna, Louisiana |isbn=1-58980-672-7 |pages=101, 186, 212, 219 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BPKo3kC3YtIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=February 26, 2012}}</ref>

A later book by Sloan, ''JFK: Breaking the Silence'', quotes several assassination eyewitnesses as saying that Warren Commission interviewers repeatedly cut short or stifled any comments casting doubt on the conclusion that Oswald acted alone.  An updated version of Sloan's book, retitled ''The Kennedy Conspiracy: 12 Startling Revelations About the JFK Assassination'', was published as an e-book in 2012. It includes the only comprehensive interview ever conducted with the late Ed Hoffman, a deaf-mute eyewitness. Through a sign-language interpreter, Hoffman tells of seeing gunmen behind the wooden fence in Dealey Plaza as Kennedy's motorcade passed by.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

In his book ''Crossfire'', [[Jim Marrs]] gave accounts of several people who said they were intimidated by FBI agents, or intimidated by anonymous individuals, into altering or suppressing what they knew about the assassination, including Richard Carr, Acquilla Clemmons, Sandy Speaker, and A.

Another "suspicious death" cited by Jim Marrs was that of Joseph Milteer, director of the Dixie [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] of Georgia. Milteer was secretly tape-recorded thirteen days before the assassination telling Miami police informant William Somersett that the murder of Kennedy was "in the working." Milteer died in 1974 when a heater exploded in his house.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=562}}<ref name="ReferenceA">Turner, Nigel.

Robert Bouck, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Secret Service's Protective Research Section, "...testified to the committee that threat information was transmitted from one region of the country to another if there was specific evidence it was relevant to the receiving region."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0132a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 233.</ref>

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated the allegation "that a statistically improbable number of individuals with some direct or peripheral association with the Kennedy assassination died as a result of that assassination, thereby raising the specter of conspiracy".<ref name="HCSA-IV"/> The committee's chief of research testified: "Our final conclusion on the issue is that the available evidence does not establish anything about the nature of these deaths which would indicate that the deaths were in some manner, either direct or peripheral, caused by the assassination of President Kennedy or by any aspect of the subsequent investigation."<ref name="HCSA-IV"/>

Author [[Gerald Posner]] points out that Marrs' list was taken from the group of about 10,000 people connected even in the most tenuous way to the assassination, one of the multiple official investigations, or the independent research of conspiracy theorists.  He notes that it would be surprising if a hundred people out of ten thousand did not die in "unnatural ways" and points out over half of the people on Marrs' list did not in fact die mysteriously, but of natural causes, such as Secret Service agent [[Roy Kellerman]], who died of heart failure at age 69 in 1984, long after the Kennedy assassination, but is on Marrs' list as someone whose cause of death is "unknown".  Posner also points out that many prominent witnesses and conspiracy researchers continue to live long lives and have not made it onto the mysterious death list.<ref name="Posner2003">{{cite book|author=Gerald Posner|title=Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Er9LPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=2003|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3462-8|pages=489<U+2013>491}}</ref>

==Allegations of evidence suppression, tampering, and fabrication==
According to Vincent Bugliosi, allegations that the evidence against Oswald was planted, forged, or tampered with is a main argument among those who believe a conspiracy took place.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=984}}

===Suppression of evidence===

====Ignored testimony====
Some assassination researchers assert that witness statements indicating a conspiracy were ignored by the Warren Commission. In 1967, Josiah Thompson stated that the Commission ignored the testimony of seven witnesses who saw gunsmoke in the area of the stockade fence on the grassy knoll, as well as an eighth witness who smelled gunpowder at the time of the assassination.<ref name="Thompson">{{cite news |title='3 Gunmen Involved in JFK's Slaying; 4 Bullets Fired' |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4xNdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MVoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1431%2C2577977 |agency=UPI |newspaper=St. Joseph Gazette |location=St. Joseph, Missouri |date=November 16, 1967 |pages=1A-2A |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> In 1989, Jim Marrs wrote that the Commission failed to ask for the testimony of witnesses on the triple overpass whose statements pointed to a shooter on the grassy knoll.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=87}}

====Confiscated film and photographs====
Other researchers reported that witnesses who captured the assassination in photographs or on film had their cameras and/or film confiscated by police or other authorities. Author Jim Marrs and documentary producer Nigel Turner presented the account of [[Gordon Arnold]] who said that his film of the motorcade was taken by two policemen shortly after the assassination.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=88}}<ref name="ReferenceC">Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 2, "The Forces of Darkness"'', 1988.</ref> Another witness, Beverly Oliver, came forward in 1970 and said she was the "[[Babushka Lady]]" who is seen, in the [[Zapruder film]], filming the motorcade. She said that after the assassination she was contacted at work by two men who she thought "...were either FBI or Secret Service agents." According to Oliver, the men told her that they wanted to develop her film and would return it to her within ten days, but they never returned the film.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=36}}<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

====Withheld documents====
Richard Buyer and others have complained that many documents pertaining to the assassination have been withheld over the years, including documents from the Warren Commission investigation, the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation, and the Church Committee investigation.<ref name="Buyer"/> These documents at one time included the President's autopsy records. Some documents are still not scheduled for release until 2029. Many documents were released during the mid-to-late 1990s by the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] under the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992]]. However, some of the material released contains [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] sections. Tax return information, which would identify employers and sources of income, has not yet been released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/part03.htm|title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board|publisher=Assassination Records Review Board|month=September|year=1998}}</ref>

The existence of large numbers of secret documents related to the assassination, and the long period of secrecy, suggests to some the possibility of a cover-up. One historian noted, "There exists widespread suspicion about the government's disposition of the Kennedy assassination records stemming from the beliefs that Federal officials (1) have not made available all Government assassination records (even to the Warren Commission, Church Committee, House Assassination Committee) and (2) have heavily redacted the records released under FOIA in order to cover up sinister conspiracies."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/part03.htm|title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board, Chapter 1: The Problem of Secrecy and the Solution of the JFK Act|author=Athan G.

===Tampering of evidence===
Some researchers have alleged that various items of physical evidence have been tampered with, including: the [[Single bullet theory|"single bullet"]], also known as the "magic bullet" by critics of the official explanations; various bullet cartridges and fragments; [[SS-100-X|the limousine's windshield]]; the paper bag in which the Warren Commission said Oswald hid the rifle; the so-called "backyard" photos which depict Oswald holding the rifle; the Zapruder film; the photographs and radiographs obtained at Kennedy's autopsy; and Kennedy's body itself.<ref>[http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Evidence_Tampering%3F Evidence Tampering].

====The "backyard" photos====
Among the evidence against Oswald are the [[Lee Harvey Oswald#Backyard photos|photographs of Oswald]] posing in his backyard with a Carcano rifle<U+2014>the weapon identified by the Warren Commission as the assassination weapon.

In his 1981 book ''Best Evidence'', [[David Lifton]] presented the thesis that President Kennedy<U+2019>s body (i.e., the "best evidence") had been altered between the Dallas hospital and the autopsy site at Bethesda for the purposes of creating erroneous conclusions about the number and direction of the shots.<ref>[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]].

===Fabrication of evidence===

====Murder weapon====
The Warren Commission found that the shots which killed Kennedy and wounded Connally were fired from [[John F. Kennedy assassination rifle|the Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle owned by Oswald]].<ref name="WCR-C1">{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Dallas District Attorney [[Henry Wade]] told the press that the weapon found in the Book Depository was a 7.65 Mauser, and this was reported by the media.<ref name="WCR-C5">{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

{{sfn|Groden|1995|p=118}} According to Mark Lane:

<blockquote>The strongest element in the case against Lee Harvey Oswald was the Warren Commission's conclusion that his rifle had been found on the 6th floor of the Book Depository building. Yet Oswald never owned a 7.65 Mauser. When the FBI later reported that Oswald had purchased only a 6.5 Italian Mannlicher-Carcano, the weapon at police headquarters in Dallas miraculously changed its size, its make and its nationality. The Warren Commission concluded that a 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano, not a 7.65 German Mauser, had been discovered by the Dallas deputies.<ref>{{cite video |people=Mark Lane |date=1976 |title=Two Men in Dallas |publisher=Tapeworm Video Distributors |time= |id= |asin=B000NHDFBQ |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref></blockquote>

In ''Matrix for Assassination'', author Richard Gilbride suggested that both weapons were involved and that Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz and Lieutenant J. Carl Day might have been conspirators.<ref name="Gilbride">{{cite book |title=Matrix for Assassination: The JFK Conspiracy |last=Gilbride |first=Richard |year=2009 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=1-4269-1390-7 |page=267 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I1VBUrmaMPkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>

Addressing "speculation and rumors", the Warren Commission identified Weitzman as "the original source of the speculation that the rifle was a Mauser" and stated that "[p]olice laboratory technicians subsequently arrived and correctly identified the weapon as a 6.5 Italian rifle."<ref name="WCR-A12">{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

====Bullets and cartridges====
The Warren Commission determined that three bullets were fired at Kennedy. One of the three bullets missed the vehicle entirely; another bullet hit Kennedy, passed through his body and then struck Governor John Connally; and the third bullet was the fatal head shot to the President. Some claim that the bullet that passed through President Kennedy<U+2019>s body before striking Governor Connally<U+2014>dubbed by critics of the Commission as the "magic bullet"<U+2014>was missing too little mass to account for the total weight of bullet fragments later found by the doctors who operated on Connally. Those making this claim included Connally<U+2019>s chief surgeon, Dr. Robert Shaw,<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0061a.htm Testimony of Dr. Robert Shaw], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, pp. 113<U+2013>114.</ref> as well as two of the Kennedy autopsy surgeons, Commander James Humes,<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0191b.htm Testimony of Commander James Humes], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 2, pp. 374<U+2013>376.</ref> and Lt. Colonel Pierre Finck.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0195b.htm Testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Finck], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 2, p. 382.</ref> However, in the book ''Six Seconds in Dallas'', author Josiah Thompson took issue with this claim. Thompson added up the weight of the bullet fragments listed in the doctor reports and concluded that their total weight "could" have been less than the mass missing from the bullet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/wound5.txt |title=Josiah Thompson, Six Seconds in Dallas, pages 147<U+2013>151 |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref>

With Connally's death in 1993, forensic pathologist Dr. [[Cyril Wecht]] and the [[Assassination Archives and Research Center]] petitioned [[Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] to recover the remaining bullet fragments from Connally's body, contending that the fragments would disprove the Warren Commission's [[single-bullet theory|single-bullet]], single-gunman conclusion. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] replied that it "...would have no legal authority to recover the fragments unless Connally's family gave [it] permission." Connally's family refused permission.<ref>Matthew P. Smith, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', A-5,  June 19, 1993.</ref>

==Allegations of multiple gunmen==
[[File:Dealey Plaza 2003.jpg|thumb|[[Dealey Plaza]] in 2003.]]
The Warren Commission concluded that "three shots were fired [from the Texas School Book Depository] in a time period ranging from approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds."<ref name="WCR3">{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1964 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Chapter 3: The Shots from the Texas School Book Depository |chapterurl=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-3.html}}</ref> Some assassination researchers, including Anthony Summers, dispute the Commission's findings. They point to evidence that brings into question the number of shots fired, the origin of the shots, and the ability of Oswald to accurately fire three shots in a short amount of time. These researchers suggest the involvement of multiple gunmen.{{sfn|Summers|2013|pp=31-}}

Governor Connally, seated in the limousine's jump seat directly in front of Kennedy, testified before the Warren Commission that "...the thought immediately passed through my mind that there were either two or three people involved, or more, in this<U+2014>or someone was shooting with an automatic rifle."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh4/html/WC_Vol4_0071a.htm Testimony of Gov. John Bowden Connally], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, p. 133.</ref>

===Number of shots===
Based on the "consensus among the witnesses at the scene" and "in particular the three spent cartridges", the Warren Commission determined that "the preponderance of the evidence indicated that three shots were fired".<ref name="WCR3"/> In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded there were four shots, one coming from the direction of the grassy knoll.<ref name="HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75"/><ref name="nationalarch">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/|title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives|publisher=United States National Archives|year=1979|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}</ref>

The Warren Commission, and later the House Select Committee on Assassinations, concluded that one of the shots hit President Kennedy in "the back of his neck", exited his throat, continued on to strike Governor Connally in the back, exited Connally's chest, shattered his right wrist, and embedded itself in his left thigh.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0022a.htm Warren Report], chapter 1, p. 19.</ref> This conclusion came to be known as the "[[single bullet theory]]".

[[Mary Moorman]] said in a TV interview immediately after the assassination that there were three or four shots close together, that shots were still being fired after she took her photograph of the President being hit, and that she was in the line of fire.<ref>[http://www.jfklancer.com/moorman_essay/moorman_essay_4.html JFK Lancer], ABC/WFAA interview of Mary Moorman filmed late in the afternoon of 11/22/63</ref> In 1967, Josiah Thompson concluded that four shots were fired in Dealey Plaza, with one wounding Connally and three hitting Kennedy.<ref name="Thompson"/>

===Origin of the shots===
[[File:JFK Wooden Fence.jpg|thumb|The wooden fence on the grassy knoll.]]
The Warren Commission concluded that all of the shots fired at President Kennedy originated from the sixth-floor window at the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository. The Commission based its conclusion on the "cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic experts and medical authorities," including onsite testing, as well as analysis of films and photographs conducted by the FBI and Secret Service.<ref name="WCR3"/>

In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations agreed to publish a report from Warren Commission critic [[Robert Groden]], in which he named "nearly [two] dozen suspected firing points in Dealey Plaza".<ref name="HCSA-VI">{{cite book |title=Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=957 |volume=VI |year=1979 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=306<U+2013>308 |ref={{harvid|Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Volume VI|1979}}}}</ref> These sites included multiple locations in or on the roof of the Texas School Book Depository, the Dal-Tex Building, and the Dallas County Records Building, as well as the railroad overpass, a storm drain located along the north curb of Elm street, and various spots near the "grassy knoll".<ref name="HCSA-VI"/> Josiah Thompson concluded that the shots fired on the motorcade came from three locations: the Texas School Book Depository, the area of the grassy knoll, and the Dal-Tex Building.<ref name="Thompson"/>

====Testimony of eyewitnesses====
According to some assassination researchers, the grassy knoll was identified by the majority of witnesses as the area from where shots were fired.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=88}}<ref name="Feldman">{{cite journal |author=Harold Feldman |year=1965 |month=March |title=Fifty-one Witnesses: The Grassy Knoll |trans_title= |journal=The Minority of One |volume=7 |series=64 |issue=3 |pages=16<U+2013>25 |at= |chapter= |publisher=Menachem Arnoni |editor1-first=Menachem |editor1-last=Arnoni |editor1-link= |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |url=http://spot.acorn.net/jfkplace/09/fp.back_issues/12th_Issue/51_wits.html |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref>

[[Lee Bowers]] operated a railroad tower that overlooked the parking lot on the north side of the grassy knoll. He reported that he saw two men behind the picket fence at the top of the grassy knoll before the shooting. The men did not appear to be acting together and did not appear to be doing anything suspicious.  After the shooting, Bowers said that one of the men remained behind the fence. Bowers said that he lost track of the second man whose clothing blended into the foliage. When interviewed by Mark Lane, Bowers noted that he saw something that attracted his attention, either a flash of light, or maybe smoke, from the knoll, leading him to believe "something out of the ordinary" had occurred there. Bowers told Lane he heard three shots, the last two in quick succession. Bowers opined that they could not have come from the same rifle.<ref>{{cite video |people=Lee Bowers  |title=Rush to Judgment / The Plot to Kill JFK: Rush to Judgment |url= |medium= movie / videotape |publisher=Judgment Films / Mpi Home Video |date=1967 / August 31, 1994 |time= |id= |asin=6301045718 |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

William and Gayle Newman were standing at the curb on the north side of Elm St. with their two children.  Mr. Newman said that the shot to Kennedy's head was fired from behind him (from the knoll).

Jesse Price was the building engineer for the Terminal Annex Building, located across from the Texas School Book Depository on the opposite side of Dealey Plaza. Price viewed the presidential motorcade from the Terminal Annex Building's roof. In an interview with Mark Lane, Price said that he believed the shots came from "just behind the picket fence where it joins the underpass."{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=39}} He claimed to have seen a "...man run towards the passenger cars on the railroad siding after the volley of shots."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh19/html/WH_Vol19_0255b.htm Decker Exhibit No. 5323], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, p. 492.</ref>

====Physical evidence====

Several conspiracy theories posit that at least one shooter was located in the [[Dal-Tex Building]], which is located across the street from the [[Texas School Book Depository]].<ref name="Esquire 1967">{{cite journal |year=1967 |month=May |title=A Second Primer of Assassination Theories |journal=Esquire |series= |pages=104 ff |at= |chapter= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |url=http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/conspiracy_theories/Second_Primer/Second_primer.html |laysource= |laysummary= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref> According to [[L.

Some assassination researchers claim that FBI photographs of the presidential limousine show a bullet hole in its windshield above the rear-view mirror, and a crack in the windshield itself. When Robert Groden, author of ''The Killing of a President'', asked for an explanation, the FBI responded that what Groden thought was a bullet hole "occurred prior to Dallas".<ref>Robert Groden ''The Killing of a President'' 1993, pp. 142<U+2013>144.</ref><ref>Fetzer, James.

====Film and photographic evidence====
Film and photographic evidence of the assassination have led viewers to different conclusions regarding the origin of the shots. In the Zapruder film, the President's head and upper torso move backwards after the last, fatal shot<U+2014>an indication that the bullet was fired from the front. However, close inspection of frames 312 and 313 show Kennedy's head moving forward by as much as 1.9 
&nbsp;inches, before his head moves backwards.<ref>Richard B. Trask, Pictures of the Pain (Danvers, Mass.: Yeoman, 1994), p. 124.</ref> Some, including [[Robert Groden]] and [[Cyril Wecht]], state that the film is evidence of a "double hit" to Kennedy's head.<ref name="Simon">{{cite book |last1=Simon |first1=Art |title=Dangerous Knowledge: The JFK Assassination in Art and Film |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hynlm5Aaa3EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |series=Culture and the Moving Image |year=1996 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-56639-379-9 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Zapruder Film |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=hynlm5Aaa3EC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref=harv}}</ref>{{sfn|Krajicek|p=11}} Wecht believes that the film depicts the President's head being "struck twice in a synchronized fashion, from the rear and the right front side."{{sfn|Krajicek|p=11}} A further theory says that it was the braking of the car by the driver [[William Greer]] which caused Kennedy's head to move forward as a frontal shot was fired. Paul Chambers argues that Frame Z313 shows multiple jets of blood, bone and brain matter exiting just above Kennedy's right ear and claims this is consistent with a high velocity (approx. 4,000&nbsp;ft/sec) rifle rather than the medium velocity (2,000&nbsp;ft/sec) Mannlicher-Carcano.<ref>G Paul Chambers.

====Acoustical evidence====
According to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, a [[Dictabelt evidence relating to the assassination of John F. Kennedy|Dictabelt recording of the Dallas Police Department radio dispatch transmissions from November 22, 1963]] was analyzed to "resolve questions concerning the number, timing, and origin of the shots fired in Dealey Plaza".<ref name="HCSA-IB">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=66 |chapter=I.B. |chapterurl=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1b.html |ref={{harvid|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section B|1979}}}}</ref> The Committee concluded that the source of the recording was from an open microphone on the motorcycle of H.B. McLain escorting the motorcade{{sfn|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section B|1979|p=78}} and that "the scientific acoustical evidence established a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F. Kennedy."{{sfn|Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Chapter I, Section B|1979|p=93}}

The acoustical analysis firm hired by the Committee recommended that the Committee conduct an acoustical reconstruction of the assassination in Dealey Plaza to determine if any of the six impulse patterns on the dispatch tape were fired from the Texas School Book Depository or the grassy knoll. The reconstruction would entail firing from two locations in Dealey Plaza<U+2014>the depository and the knoll<U+2014>at particular target locations and recording the sounds through numerous microphones. The purpose was to determine if the sequences of impulses recorded during the reconstruction would match any of those on the dispatch tape. If so, it would be possible to determine if the impulse patterns on the dispatch tape were caused by shots fired during the assassination from shooter locations in the depository and on the knoll.<ref name="history-matters.com">[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0057a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 83.</ref>

In 1978, at the behest of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, members of the Dallas Police Pistol Team participated in an acoustical reconstruction by firing both rifles and pistols from the locations selected by the researchers. During the acoustical reconstruction, the Dallas Police marksmen had no difficulty hitting the targets. The House Select Committee's firearms experts "...testified that given the distance and angle from the sixth floor window to the location of the President's limousine, it would have been easier to use the open iron sights." The Warren Commission tests had been carried out on the assumption that Oswald, who they and the Committee concluded fired the shots, used the telescopic sight.<ref name="history-matters.com"/>

An article which appeared in ''[[Science & Justice]]'', a quarterly publication of Britain's Forensic Science Society, found there was a 96% certainty, based on analysis of audio recordings made during the assassination, that a shot was fired from "the grassy knoll" in front of and to the right of the President's limousine.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/JFK/bbcgrassy.htm| author=George Lardner Jr.| title=Study Backs Theory of 'Grassy Knoll': New Report Says Second Gunman Fired at Kennedy (mirror of missing story at http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A56560-2001Mar25)|work=The Washington Post| date=March 26, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,103958,00.html| author=Frank Pellegrini| title=The Grassy Knoll Is Back|work=Time Magazine| date=March 26, 2001}}</ref>

Some critics skeptical of the official "[[single bullet theory]]" state that the trajectory of the bullet, which hit Kennedy above the right shoulder blade and passed through his neck (according to the autopsy), would have had to change course to pass through Connally's rib cage and wrist.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=hluBF0hAyvIC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=kennedy+fbi+three+shots+five+seconds&source=bl&ots=3cWJsvT5Zh&sig=Z3H2gohS3y1nlvcwV9Y9IzL82Fw&hl=en&ei=eU3kTr3XJ8idmQWpy5iOBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&sqi=2&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kennedy%20fbi%20three%20shots%20five%20seconds&f=false| author=Michael Newton, John L.

On the day of the assassination, [[Nellie Connally]] was seated in the presidential car next to her husband, Governor John Connally.

===Oswald's marksmanship===
The Warren Commission examined the capabilities of the Carcano rifle and ammunition, as well as Oswald's military training and post-military experience, and determined that Oswald had the ability to fire three shots within a time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.<ref name="WCR4">{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964}}}}</ref> According to their report, an army specialist using Oswald's rifle was able to duplicate the feat and even improved on the time. The report also states that the Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch test fired Oswald's rifle 47 times and found that it was "quite accurate", comparing it to the accuracy of an [[M-14 rifle]]. Also contained in the Commission report is testimony by [[Marine Corps]] Major Eugene Anderson confirming that Oswald's military records show that he qualified as "[[sharpshooter]]" in 1956. But this is confronted with more detailed record of his shooting abilities. According to official Marine Corps records Oswald was tested in shooting, scoring 212 in December 1956 (slightly above the minimum for qualification as a sharpshooter - the intermediate category), but in May 1959 scoring only 191 (barely earning the lower designation of marksman - the lowest category of skilled shooter, but still above undesignated shooters). He never approached the highest marksmanship category in the Marine Corps - the Expert. Conspiracy theorists such as Walt Brown and authors such as [[Richard H. Popkin]] contend that Oswald was a notoriously poor shot, his rifle was inaccurate, and that no one has ever been able to duplicate his ability to fire three shots within the time frame given by the Warren Commission.<ref name="Aaronovitch2010">{{cite book|author=David Aaronovitch|title=Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0t7lC3nmFq8C&pg=PT107|accessdate=March 21, 2012|date=February 4, 2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-59448-895-5|pages=107<U+2013>}}</ref>{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=xxxviii}} FBI marksman Robert Frazier who tested the rifle in two sets of tests testified to the Warren Commission that he could not reach the 5.6 second mark for firing three shots and all his shots fired five inches high and five inches to the right due to an uncorrectable deficiency in the telescopic sight.<ref>Warren Commission.

===Role of Oswald===
Assassination researchers differ as to the role of Oswald in the assassination of President Kennedy. Many believe that Oswald was an uninvolved patsy, while others believe he was actively involved in a plot.

New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, who in 1967 brought [[Clay Shaw]] to trial for the assassination of President Kennedy, stated in the documentary, ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy'', "[Oswald] was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency and was obviously drawn into a [[scapegoat]] situation and made to believe ultimately that he was penetrating the assassination.  And then when the time came, they took the scapegoat<U+2014>the man who thought he was working for the United States government<U+2014>and killed him real quick. And then the machinery, [[disinformation]] machinery, started turning and they started making a villain out of a man who genuinely was probably a hero."<ref name="Turner, Nigel 1991"/>

James Botelho, a former roommate of Oswald who would later become a California judge, stated in an interview with Mark Lane, "Oswald, it was said, was the only Marine ever to defect from his country to another country, a Communist country, during peacetime....

The [[three tramps]] are three men photographed by several [[newspapers of Dallas, Texas|Dallas-area newspapers]] under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination. Since the mid-1960s, various allegations have been made about the identities of the men and their involvement in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

According to the Warren Commission, the publication of a full page, paid advertisement critical of Kennedy in the November 22, 1963, ''Dallas Morning News'', which was signed by "The American Fact-Finding Committee" and noted Bernard Weissman as its chairman, was investigated to determine whether any members of the group claiming responsibility for it were connected to Oswald or to the assassination.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

===Unnamed accomplice or accomplices in the murder of J. D. Tippit===

The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald "...killed Dallas Police Officer [[J. D. Tippit]] in an apparent attempt to escape."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=195}} The evidence that formed the basis for this conclusion was: "(1) two eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit and seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with revolver in hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw fire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge cases found near the scene of the shooting were fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of all other weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald's possession at the time of his arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald, and (4) Oswald's jacket was found along the path of flight taken by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=176}}

Some researchers have alleged that the murder of Officer Tippit was part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. Jim Marrs hypothesized that "the slaying of Officer J. D. Tippit may have played some part in [a] scheme to have Oswald killed, perhaps to eliminate co-conspirator Tippit or simply to anger Dallas police and cause itchy trigger fingers."{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=585}} Researcher James Douglass said that "...the killing of [Tippit] helped motivate the Dallas police to kill an armed Oswald in the Texas Theater, which would have disposed of the scapegoat before he could protest his being framed."{{sfn|Douglass|2010|p=287}} Harold Weisberg offered a simpler explanation: "Immediately, the [flimsy] police case [against Oswald] required a willingness to believe. This was proved by affixing to Oswald the opprobrious epithet of 'cop-killer.'"{{sfn|Douglass|2010|p=287}} [[Jim Garrison]] alleged that evidence was altered to frame Oswald, stating: "If Oswald was innocent of the Tippit murder the foundation of the government's case against him collapsed."<ref name="Garrison">{{cite book |last1=Garrison |first1=Jim |authorlink1=Jim Garrison |title=On the Trail of the Assassins: My Investigation and Prosecution of the Murder of President Kennedy |url=http://scribblguy.50megs.com/tippit.htm  |year=1988 |publisher=Sheridan Square Press |isbn=978-0-941781-02-2 |page=197 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Some critics doubt that Tippit was killed by Oswald and assert he was shot by other conspirators.{{sfn|Perry|2003|p=391}}<ref name="Bonokowski"/> They allege discrepancies in witness testimony and physical evidence which they feel call into question the Commission's conclusions regarding the murder of Tippit. According to Jim Marrs, Oswald's guilt in the assassination of Kennedy is placed in question by the presence of "a growing body of evidence to suggest that [he] did not kill Tippit".{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=340}} Others say that multiple men were directly involved in Tippit's killing. Conspiracy researcher [[Kenn Thomas]] has alleged that the Warren Commission omitted testimony and evidence that two men shot Tippit and that one left the scene in a car.<ref name="Thomas">{{cite book |editor1-first=Kenn |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-link=Kenn Thomas |title=Cyberculture Counterconspiracy: A Steamshovel Web Reader |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IBLhW_rNZcoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |volume=2 |year=2000 |publisher=The Book Tree |location=Escondido, California |isbn=978-1-58509-126-3 |page=63 |chapter=The Tippit Connection |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=IBLhW_rNZcoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{harvid|Thomas|2000}}}}</ref>

William Alexander<U+2014>the Dallas assistant district attorney who recommended that Oswald be charged with the Kennedy and Tippit murders<U+2014>later became skeptical of the Warren Commission's version of the Tippit murder.

According to [[Brian McKenna]]'s review of Henry Hurt's book, ''Reasonable Doubt'', Hurt reported that "Tippit may have been killed because he impregnated the wife of another man" and that Dallas police officers lied and altered evidence to set up Oswald to save Tippit's reputation.<ref name="McKenna">{{cite news |title=JFK: A distinguished American journalist has joined the unofficial sleuths tracking the killers and those who covered up, from Montreal to Mexico City and back again |author=Brian McKenna |authorlink=Brian McKenna |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S4s0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=X6gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1623%2C5250251 |newspaper=The Gazette |location=Montreal |date=April 19, 1986 |page=B7 |accessdate=April 14, 2012 |ref=}}</ref>

====Allegations regarding witness testimony and physical evidence====
The Warren Commission identified Helen Markham and Domingo Benavides as two witnesses who actually saw the shooting.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|pp=166<U+2013>167}} Conspiracy theorist [[Richard Belzer]] criticized the Commission for, in his description, "relying" on the testimony of Markham whom he described as "imaginative".<ref name="Belzer">{{cite book |last1=Belzer |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Belzer |title=UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don't Have to Be Crazy to Believe |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yDrJa9-7irUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=2000 |publisher=Ballantine Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-345-42918-6 |chapter=Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak No Evil |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=yDrJa9-7irUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT50#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref=harv}}</ref> Jim Marrs also took issue with Markham's testimony, stating that her "credibility ... was strained to the breaking point".{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=340}} Joseph Ball, senior counsel to the Commission, referred to Markham's testimony as "full of mistakes," characterizing her as an "utter screwball."{{sfn|Summers|2013|pp=104-105}} The Warren Commission addressed concerns regarding Markham's reliability as a witness and concluded: "However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham's testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of Tippit."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|pp=166<U+2013>167}}

Domingo Benavides initially said that he did not think he could identify Tippit's assailant and was never asked to view a police lineup,<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0231a.htm Testimony of Domingo Benavides], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, pp. 451<U+2013>52.</ref> even though he was the person closest to the killing.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=341}} Benavides later testified that the killer resembled pictures he had seen of Oswald.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0231b.htm Testimony of Domingo Benavides], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, p. 452.</ref> Other witnesses were taken to police lineups. However, critics have questioned these lineups in that they consisted of people who looked very different from Oswald.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=341}}<ref>Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy'', Part 5, "The Witnesses", 1991.</ref>

Additionally, witnesses who did not appear before the Commission identified an assailant who was not Oswald. Acquilla Clemons saw two men near Tippit<U+2019>s car just before the shooting.<ref name="Turner, Nigel 1991">Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 4, "The Patsy"'', 1991.</ref> After the shooting, she ran outside of her house and saw a man with a gun whom she described as "kind of heavy." He waved to the second man, urging him to "go on."{{sfn|Summers|2013|pp=105-106}} Frank Wright emerged from his home and observed the scene seconds after the shooting. He described a man standing by Tippit<U+2019>s body who had on a long coat and who ran to a parked car and drove away.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=342}}{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=106}}

Critics have questioned whether the cartridge cases recovered from the scene were the same as those that were subsequently entered into evidence. Two of the cases were recovered by witness Domingo Benavides and turned over to police officer J.M. Poe. Poe told the FBI that he marked the shells with his own initials, "J.M.P." to identify them.<ref name="Commission Exhibit No. 2011">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh24/html/WH_Vol24_0217a.htm Commission Exhibit No. 2011], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 24, p. 415.</ref> Sergeant Gerald Hill later testified to the Warren Commission that it was he who had ordered police officer Poe to mark the shells.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0029a.htm Testimony of Gerald Lynn Hill], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 7, p. 49.</ref> However, Poe's initials were not found on the shells produced by the FBI six months later.<ref name="Commission Exhibit No. 2011"/>{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=343}}Testifying before the Warren Commission, Poe said that although he recalled marking the cases, he "couldn<U+2019>t swear to it."{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=343}}<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh7/html/WC_Vol7_0039a.htm Testimony of J.M. Poe], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 7, p. 69.</ref> The identification of the cases at the crime scene raises more questions. Sergeant Gerald Hill examined one of the shells and radioed the police dispatcher, saying: "The shell at the scene indicates that the suspect is armed with an automatic .38 rather than a pistol."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0451b.htm Commission Exhibit No. 1974], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 870.</ref> However, Oswald was reportedly arrested carrying a ''non''-automatic .38 Special revolver.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=342}}{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=65}}

====Allegations regarding timeline====
The Warren Commission investigated Oswald's movements between the time of the assassination and the shooting of Tippit, to ascertain whether Oswald might have had an accomplice who helped him flee the Book Depository. The Commission concluded "...through the testimony of seven witnesses [that] Oswald was always alone."{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=252}} According to their final report, Oswald was seen by his housekeeper leaving his rooming house shortly after 1:00&nbsp;pm and had enough time to travel nine-tenths of a mile (1.4&nbsp;km) to the scene where Tippit was killed at 1:16&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F.

Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=165}}}}

Some Warren Commission critics believe that Oswald did not have enough time to get from his house to the scene where Tippit was killed.{{sfn|Perry|2003|p=391}} The Commission<U+2019>s own test and estimation of Oswald<U+2019>s walking speed demonstrated that one of the longer routes to the Tippit shooting scene took 17 minutes and 45 seconds to walk.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0222b.htm Testimony of William W.

Conspiracy researcher Robert Groden believes that Tippit's murder may have occurred earlier than the time given in the Warren Report. {{sfn|Groden|1995|pp=134<U+2013>137}} He notes that the Commission established the time of the shooting as 1:16&nbsp;pm from police tapes that logged Domingo Benavides' use of the radio in Tippit's car.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964|p=165}} However, Benavides testified that he did not approach the car until "a few minutes" after the shooting, because he was afraid that the gunman might return.<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0229b.htm Testimony of Domingo Benavides], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, p. 448.</ref> He was assisted in using the radio by witness T.

Warren "Butch" Burroughs, who ran the concession stand at the [[Texas Theater]] where Oswald was arrested, told author [[James W.

According to some researchers, conspiracy theorists consider four or five groups, alone or in combination, to be the primary suspects in the assassination of Kennedy: the [[CIA]],{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=xiv}}<ref name="Meagher">{{cite book |last1=Meagher |first1=Michael |last2=Gragg |first2=Larry D. |title=John F.

===New Orleans conspiracy===
{{Further|Trial of Clay Shaw|People involved in the trial of Clay Shaw|David Ferrie}}
Soon after the assassination of President Kennedy, Oswald's activities in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], during the spring and summer of 1963, came under scrutiny. Three days after the assassination, on November 25, 1963, New Orleans attorney [[Dean Andrews Jr.|Dean Andrews]] told the FBI that he received a telephone call from a man named [[Clay Bertrand]], on the day of the assassination, asking him to defend Oswald.<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh23/html/WH_Vol23_0379b.htm Commission Exhibit No. 1931], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 726.</ref><ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh26/html/WH_Vol26_0370b.htm Commission Exhibit No. 3094], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 26, pp. 704-705.</ref> Andrews would later repeat this claim in testimony to the Warren Commission.<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh11/html/WC_Vol11_0171a.htm Testimony of Dean Andrews], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, pp. 331-334.</ref>
[[File:Ciravolo.jpg|thumb|right|David Ferrie (second from left) and Lee Harvey Oswald (far right) in a group photo of the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol in 1955 (click to enlarge)]]
Also, in late November 1963, an employee of  New Orleans [[private investigator]] [[Guy Banister]] named [[Jack Martin (investigator)|Jack Martin]] began making accusations that fellow Banister employee [[David Ferrie]] was involved in the JFK assassination. Martin told police that Ferrie "...was supposed to have been the getaway pilot in the assassination."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0058b.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 112-13.</ref> He said that Ferrie had outlined plans to kill Kennedy and that Ferrie may have taught Oswald how to use a rifle with a telescopic sight. Martin claimed that Ferrie had known Oswald from their days in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol, and that he had seen a photograph, at Ferrie's home, of Oswald in a Civil Air Patrol group.<ref>[http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=10477&relPageId=219 FBI Interview of Jack S.

However, it was later discovered that Ferrie had attended [[Civil Air Patrol]] meetings in New Orleans in the 1950s that were also attended by a teenage Lee Harvey Oswald.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/glimpse/ferrie.html PBS ''Frontline'' "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald"], broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).</ref> In 1993, the [[PBS]] television program ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' obtained a photograph taken in 1955 (eight years before the assassination) showing Oswald and Ferrie at a [[Civil Air Patrol]] cookout with other C.A.P. cadets.<ref name=autogenerated11>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/glimpse/ferrie.html PBS ''Frontline'' "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald"], broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).</ref> (Whether Oswald's and Ferrie's association in the Civil Air Patrol in 1955 is relevant to their later possible association in 1963 is a subject of debate.)<ref name=autogenerated11>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/glimpse/ferrie.html PBS ''Frontline'' "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald"], broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).</ref><ref name="Summers, Anthony 2013 pp. 284-285">[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]].

According to several witnesses, in 1963, both Ferrie and Banister were working for lawyer [[G. Wray Gill]] on behalf of Gill's client, New Orleans Mafia boss [[Carlos Marcello]], in an attempt to block Marcello's deportation to [[Guatemala]].<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0057a.htm David Ferrie], House Select Committee on Assassinations <U+2013> Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 109.</ref><ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0066a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations <U+2013> Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 127.</ref> On the afternoon of November 22, 1963<U+2014>the day [[John F.

On their return to Banister's office, the two men got into a heated argument. According to Martin, Banister said something to which Martin replied, "What are you going to do<U+2014>kill me like you all did Kennedy?" Banister drew his .357 magnum revolver and [[pistol whip|pistol-whipped]] Martin several times. Martin, badly injured, went by ambulance to [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0067b.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations <U+2013> Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 130.</ref>

Earlier, in the spring of 1963, Oswald had written to the [[New York City]] headquarters of the pro-Castro [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]], proposing to rent "...a small office at my own expense for the purpose of forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0266b.htm Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 2], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 512.</ref> As the sole member of the New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Oswald ordered 1,000 leaflets with the heading, "Hands Off Cuba" from a local printer.<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh25/html/WC_Vol25_0402a.htm FBI Report of Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities for Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, pp. 770, 773.</ref> On August 16, 1963, Oswald passed out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets in front of the [[International Trade Mart]] in New Orleans,<ref>[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Open Road, 2013), pp. 247-. ISBN 978-1-4804-3548-3</ref>

One of Oswald's leaflets had the address "544 Camp Street" hand-stamped on it, apparently by Oswald himself.<ref name=autogenerated8>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0064a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations<U+2014>Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, p. 123.</ref> The address was in the "Newman Building" which, from October 1961 to February 1962, housed the militant anti-Castro group, the [[Cuban Revolutionary Council]].<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0064a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations<U+2014>Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, pp. 123<U+2013>4.</ref><ref>Marrs, Jim.

In the late-1970s, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) investigated the possible relationship of Oswald to Banister's office. While the committee was unable to interview [[Guy Banister]] (who died in 1964), the committee did interview his brother Ross Banister. Ross "...told the committee that his brother had mentioned seeing Oswald hand out Fair Play for Cuba literature on one occasion. Ross theorized that Oswald had used the 544 Camp Street address on his literature to embarrass Guy."<ref>[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0066b.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations<U+2014>Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, p. 128.</ref>

Guy Banister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, would later tell author [[Anthony Summers]] that she saw Oswald at Banister's office, and that he filled out one of Banister's "agent" application forms. She said, "Oswald came back a number of times. He seemed to be on familiar terms with Banister and with the office."<ref>[[Anthony Summers|Summers, Anthony]]. ''Not in Your Lifetime'', (New York: Open Road, 2013), p. 276-. ISBN 978-1-4804-3548-3</ref> The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated Roberts' claims and said that "because of contradictions in Roberts' statements to the committee and lack of independent corroboration of many of her statements, the reliability of her statements could not be determined."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0067a.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations<U+2014>Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 8, p. 129.</ref>

In 1966, New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy. Garrison's investigation led him to conclude that a group of [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] extremists, including David Ferrie and Guy Banister, were involved with elements of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Garrison would later claim that the motive for the assassination was anger over Kennedy's attempts to obtain a peace settlement in both Cuba and Vietnam.<ref name="Jim Garrison Interview">[http://www.jfklancer.com/Garrison2.html Jim Garrison Interview], ''Playboy'' magazine, Eric Norden, October 1967.</ref><ref>[[Jim Garrison|Garrison, Jim]].

ISBN 0-941781-02-X</ref> On March 1, 1967, Garrison arrested and charged Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy. On January 29, 1969, Clay Shaw was brought to trial on these charges, and the jury found him not guilty.

In 2003, Judyth Vary Baker<U+2014>whose employment records show that she worked at the [[Reily Foods Company|Reily Coffee Company]] in New Orleans at the same time Oswald did<U+2014>appeared in an episode of [[Nigel Turner]]'s documentary television series, ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''.<ref name="Turner, Nigel 2003">Turner, Nigel.

===CIA conspiracy===
{{main|CIA Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory}}

The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that "[t]here was no indication in Oswald's CIA file that he had ever had contact with the Agency" and concluded that the CIA was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.<ref name="HCSA-IC">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=I.C. The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy |chapterurl=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1c.html}}</ref>

Gaeton Fonzi, an investigator for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, wrote that investigators were pressured not to look into the relationship between [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and the CIA. He stated that CIA agent [[David Atlee Phillips]], using the pseudonym "Maurice Bishop", was involved with Oswald prior to the Kennedy assassination in connection with anti-Castro Cuban groups.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://www.amazon.com/Last-Investigation-Gaeton-Fonzi/dp/0980121353| author=Gaeton Fonzi| title=The Last Investigation| publisher=The Mary Ferrell Foundation| year=2008| ISBN=0-9801213-5-3}}</ref>

In 1995, former U.S. Army [[Military intelligence|Intelligence]] officer and [[National Security Agency]] executive assistant [[John M. Newman]] published evidence that both the CIA and FBI deliberately tampered with their files on Lee Harvey Oswald both before and after the assassination. Furthermore, he found that both agencies withheld information that might have alerted authorities in Dallas that Oswald posed a potential threat to the President. Subsequently, Newman expressed a belief that CIA chief of counter-intelligence [[James Angleton]] was probably the key figure in the assassination. According to Newman, only Angleton "had the access, the authority, and the diabolically ingenious mind to manage this sophisticated plot." However, Newman surmised that the cover operation was not under James Angleton, but under [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]] (the former CIA director, and later Warren Commission member, who had been dismissed by Kennedy after the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]]).<ref name="Newman">{{cite book |last=Newman |first=John M. |authorlink=John M.

According to investigative reporter Joseph Trento, among  senior government officials, only James Angleton continued to express the belief that Kennedy assassination was not carried out by a lone gunman.<ref>''Joseph J. Trento'', The Secret History of the CIA. Basic Books (2005) , p. 284</ref>

===Military-industrial complex===
Some conspiracy theorists have argued that Kennedy planned to end the involvement of the United States in Vietnam and was therefore targeted by those who had an interest in sustained military conflict, including the Pentagon and defense contractors.{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=207}}

Former Texas Senator [[Ralph Yarborough]] in 1991 stated: "Had Kennedy lived, I think we would have had no Vietnam War, with all of its traumatic and divisive influences in America.  I think we would have escaped that."<ref>Ralph Yarborough, interviewed in the documentary ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy'', Part 5, "The Witnesses"</ref>

According to author James Douglass, Kennedy was assassinated because he was turning away from the [[Cold War]] and seeking a negotiated peace with the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=11206&comments=1 |author=George M.

[[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 movie ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' explored the possibility that Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy involving the military-industrial complex.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE5DC1230F933A15751C1A967958260| author=Vincent Canby| title=J.F.K.; When Everything Amounts to Nothing| work=The New York Times| date=December 20, 1991}}</ref> [[L.

===Secret Service conspiracy===
The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that it investigated "alleged Secret Service complicity in the assassination" and concluded that the Secret Service was not involved.<ref name="HCSA-IC"/> However, the HSCA declared that "the Secret Service was deficient in the performance of its duties."<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0129a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 227.</ref> Among its findings, the HSCA noted: (1) that President Kennedy had not received adequate protection in Dallas, (2) that the Secret Service possessed information that was not properly analyzed, investigated, or used by the Secret Service in connection with the President's trip to Dallas, and (3) that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade were inadequately prepared to protect the President from a sniper.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0130a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 229-35.</ref> The HSCA specifically noted:

<blockquote>No actions were taken by the agent in the right front seat of the Presidential limousine [ [[Roy Kellerman]] ] to cover the President with his body, although it would have been consistent with Secret Service procedure for him to have done so. The primary function of the agent was to remain at all times in close proximity to the President in the event of such emergencies.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0132b.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], p. 234-35.</ref></blockquote>

Some argue that the lack of Secret Service protection occurred because Kennedy himself had asked that the Secret Service make itself discreet during the Dallas visit.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|pp=29, 38}} However, Vince Palamara, who interviewed several Secret Service agents assigned to the Kennedy detail, disputes this. Palamara reports that Secret Service driver Sam Kinney told him that requests<U+2014>such as removing the bubble top from the limousine in Dallas, not having agents positioned beside the limousine's rear bumper, and reducing the number of Dallas police motorcycle outriders near the limousine's rear bumper<U+2014>were not made by Kennedy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/neigh_south/19980125bjfk5.asp| author=Mary Anne Lewis| title=JFK's death is often focus of his research| publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| date=January 26, 1998}}</ref><ref>Turner, Nigel.

In ''The Echo from Dealey Plaza'', [[Abraham Bolden]]<U+2014>the first African American on the White House Secret Service detail<U+2014>claimed to have overheard agents say that they would not protect Kennedy from would-be assassins:

<blockquote>[President Kennedy] alienated Southerners and conservatives around the country, most of whom were already suspicious of him. In this, the Secret Service reflected the more backward elements of America. Many of the  agents with whom I worked were products of the South.... I heard some members of the White House detail say that if shots were fired at the president, they'd take no action to protect him. A few agents vowed that they would quit the Secret Service rather than give up their lives for Kennedy.<ref>Bolden, Abraham. ''The Echo from Dealey Plaza'', (New York: Harmony Books, 2008), p. 19. ISBN 978-0-307-38201-6</ref></blockquote>

Questions regarding the forthrightness of the Secret Service increased in the 1990s when the [[Assassination Records Review Board]]<U+2014>which was created when Congress passed the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992|JFK Records Act]]<U+2014>requested access to Secret Service records.

===Cuban exiles===
The House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that anti-Castro Cuban groups, as groups, were not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved".<ref name="HCSA-IC"/>

With the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] that brought Fidel Castro to power, thousands of Cubans left their homeland to take up residence in the United States. Many exiles hoped to overthrow Castro and return to Cuba. Their hopes were dashed with the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, and many exiles blamed President Kennedy for the failure.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=205}}

The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that some militant Cuban exiles might have participated in Kennedy's murder. These exiles worked closely with CIA operatives in violent activities against Castro's Cuba. In 1979, the committee reported:

<blockquote>President Kennedy's popularity among the Cuban exiles had plunged deeply by 1963. Their bitterness is illustrated in a tape recording of a meeting of anti-Castro Cubans and right-wing Americans in the Dallas suburb of Farmer's Branch on October 1, 1963.<ref name="aarclibrary.org">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0081b.htm Findings of the House Select Committee on Assassinations], HSCA Final Report, p. 132.</ref></blockquote>

Holding a copy of the September 26 edition of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', featuring a front-page account of the President's planned trip to Texas in November, Cuban exile Nestor Castellanos vented his hostility:
<blockquote>CASTELLANOS ...we're waiting for Kennedy the 22d, [the date Kennedy was murdered] buddy. We're going to see him in one way or the other. We're going to give him the works when he gets in Dallas. Mr. good ol' Kennedy. I wouldn't even call him President Kennedy. He stinks.<ref name="aarclibrary.org"/></blockquote>

Author [[Joan Didion]] explored the Miami anti-Castro Cuban theory in her 1987 non-fiction book ''Miami''.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/24/nnp/miami.html James Chace, "Betrayals and Obsession", NY Times, October 25, 1987, on Joan Didion's book MIAMI]</ref><ref>Joan Didion, "MIAMI", New York, Simon & Schuster, 238pp. 1987</ref> She discussed Marita Lorenz' testimony regarding Guillermo Novo, a Cuban exile who was involved in shooting a bazooka at the U.N. building from the East River during a speech by [[Che Guevara]]. Allegedly, Novo was affiliated with Lee Harvey Oswald and Frank Sturgis and carried weapons with them to a hotel in Dallas just prior to the assassination. These claims, though put forth to the House Assassinations Committee by Lorenz, were never substantiated by a conclusive investigation.

===Organized crime conspiracy===
The House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the national syndicate of organized crime, as a group, was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved".<ref name="HCSA-IC"/>

Documents never seen by the Warren Commission have revealed that some Mafiosi worked with the CIA on assassination attempts against [[Cuba]]n leader [[Fidel Castro]].<ref>[http://www.udel.edu/leipzig/texts2/cnn03077.htm CIA offered money to Mafia]. Retrieved December 3, 2006.</ref> CIA documents released in 2007 confirmed that in the summer of 1960, the CIA recruited ex-FBI agent [[Robert Maheu]] to approach the West Coast representative of the Chicago mob, [[John Roselli|Johnny Roselli]]. When Maheu contacted Roselli, Maheu hid the fact that he was sent by the CIA, instead portraying himself an advocate for international corporations. He offered to pay $150,000 to have Castro killed, but Roselli declined any pay. Roselli introduced Maheu to two men he referred to as "Sam Gold" and "Joe." "Sam Gold" was [[Sam Giancana]]; "Joe" was [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], the Tampa, Florida boss and one of the most powerful mobsters in pre-revolution Cuba.<ref>[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/familyjewels/20070626_ciaandmob.pdf Memorandum for the Director of Central Intelligence, Subject: Roselli, Johnny], November 19, 1970.</ref>{{sfn|Douglass|2010|p=34}} Glenn Kessler of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' explained: "After Fidel Castro led a revolution that toppled a friendly government in 1959, the CIA was desperate to eliminate him.

In his memoir, ''Bound by Honor'', [[Bill Bonanno]], son of New York Mafia boss [[Joseph Bonanno]], disclosed that several Mafia families had long-standing ties with the anti-Castro Cubans through the Havana casinos operated by the Mafia before the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Many Cuban exiles and Mafia bosses disliked President Kennedy, blaming him for the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=205-}} They also disliked his brother, the young and idealistic Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]], who had conducted an unprecedented legal assault on organized crime.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=224-}}{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=208}} This was especially provocative because several Mafia "families" had allegedly worked with JFK's father, [[Joseph Kennedy]], to get JFK elected.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Both the Mafia and the anti-Castro Cubans were experts in assassination<U+2014>the Cubans having been trained by the CIA.<ref name="Bill Moyers 1977">Bill Moyers, "The CIA's Secret Army", ''CBS Reports'', June 10, 1977.</ref> Bonanno reported that he recognized the high degree of involvement of other Mafia families when Jack Ruby killed Oswald, since Bonanno was aware that Ruby was an associate of Chicago mobster [[Sam Giancana]].<ref>Bonanno, Bill.

Some conspiracy researchers have alleged a plot involving elements of the Mafia, the CIA and the anti-Castro Cubans, including Anthony Summers who stated: "Sometimes people sort of glaze over about the notion that the Mafia and U.S. intelligence and the anti-Castro activists were involved together in the assassination of President Kennedy.

In his book, ''Contract on America'', David Scheim provided evidence that Mafia leaders [[Carlos Marcello]], [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]] and [[Jimmy Hoffa]] ordered the assassination of President Kennedy.

Investigative reporter [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] concluded that Fidel Castro worked with organized crime figures to arrange the JFK assassination. In his book ''Peace, War, and Politics'', Anderson claimed that Mafia member [[Johnny Roselli]] gave him extensive details of the plot. Anderson said that although he was never able to independently confirm Roselli's entire story, many of Roselli's details checked out. Anderson said that Oswald may have played a role in the assassination, but that more than one gunman was involved. Johnny Roselli, as previously noted, had worked with the CIA on assassination attempts against Castro.

The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] program, ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'' presented additional evidence for organized crime involvement.<ref>"The Men Who Killed Kennedy: The Definitive Account of American History's Most Controversial Mystery."  History Channel, 1988, 1991, 1995. This information appears in part 2, "The Forces of Darkness" under the sections titled, "The Contract" and "Foreign Assassins".</ref> Christian David was a [[Corsican Mafia]] member interviewed in prison. He said that he was offered the assassination contract on President Kennedy, but that he did not accept it. However, he said that he knew the men who did accept the contract. According to David, there were three shooters. He provided the name of one<U+2014>[[Lucien Sarti]]. David said that since the other two shooters were still alive, it would break a code of conduct for him to identify them. When asked what the shooters were wearing, David noted their ''modus operandi'' was to dress in costumes such as official uniforms. Much of Christian David's testimony was confirmed by former Corsican member Michelle Nicole, who was part of the [[DEA]] witness protection program.

The book ''Ultimate Sacrifice'', by [[Lamar Waldron]] and [[Thom Hartman]], attempted to synthesize these theories with new evidence. The authors argued that government officials felt obliged to help the assassins cover up the truth because the assassination conspiracy had direct ties to American government plots to assassinate Castro. Outraged at [[Robert Kennedy]]'s attack on organized crime, mob leaders had President Kennedy killed to remove Robert from power. A government investigation of the plot was thwarted, the authors allege, because it would have revealed embarrassing evidence of American government involvement with organized crime in plots to kill Castro.<ref>''Ultimate Sacrifice: John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the Murder of JFK'' (2005), by Lamar Waldron, with Thom Hartmann; Carroll & Graf.

===Lyndon B. Johnson conspiracy===

In 2003, researcher Barr McClellan published the book, ''Blood, Money & Power''.<ref>McClellan, Barr, ''Blood, Money & Power: How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K.'', Hannover House 2003. ISBN 0-9637846-2-5</ref> McClellan claims that Johnson, motivated by the fear of being dropped from the Kennedy ticket in 1964 and the need to cover up various scandals, masterminded Kennedy's assassination with the help of his friend, [[Austin]] attorney [[Edward A. Clark]]. The book suggests that a smudged partial fingerprint from the sniper's nest likely belonged to Johnson's associate [[Malcolm "Mac" Wallace]], and that Mac Wallace was, therefore, on the sixth floor of the Depository at the time of the shooting. The book further claims that the killing of Kennedy was paid for by oil magnates, including [[Clint Murchison, Sr.|Clint Murchison]] and [[H. L. Hunt]]. McClellan states that the assassination of Kennedy allowed the oil depletion allowance to be kept at 27.5 percent. It remained unchanged during the Johnson presidency. According to McClellan, this resulted in a saving of over 100 million dollars to the American oil industry. McClellan's book subsequently became the subject of an episode of Nigel Turner's ongoing documentary television series, ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''. The episode, entitled "The Guilty Men", drew angry condemnation from the Johnson family, President Johnson's former aides, and ex-Presidents [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] following its airing on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]. The History Channel assembled a committee of historians who concluded the accusations in the documentary were without merit, and The History Channel apologized to the Johnson family and agreed not to air the series in the future.<ref>[[Stanley Kutler|Kutler, Stanley I.]] [http://hnn.us/articles/why-history-channel-had-apologize-documentary-blamed-lbj-jfks-murder "Why the History Channel Had to Apologize for the Documentary that Blamed LBJ for JFK's Murder"].

Madeleine Brown, who alleged she was the mistress of Johnson, also implicated him in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. In 1997, Brown said that Johnson, along with H. L. Hunt, had begun planning Kennedy's demise as early as 1960. Brown claimed that by its fruition in 1963, the conspiracy involved dozens of persons, including the leadership of the FBI and the Mafia, as well as prominent politicians and journalists.<ref>Brown, Madeleine D.

In the same documentary, several other Johnson associates also voiced their suspicions of Johnson.

Suspicions that Johnson was involved in covering-up facts about the assassination were supported by Parkland Hospital doctor [[Charles Crenshaw]]. While treating Oswald, Crenshaw said he received a phone call from Johnson. Crenshaw gave his account of the phone conversation in his book ''Trauma Room One'':

<blockquote>Johnson: "Dr. Crenshaw, how is the accused assassin?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Crenshaw: "Mr. President, he's holding his own at the moment."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Johnson: "Would you mind taking a message to the operating surgeon?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Crenshaw: "Dr. Shires is very busy right now, but I will convey your message."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Johnson: "Dr. Crenshaw, I want a death-bed confession from the accused assassin. There's a man in the operating room who will take the statement. I will expect full cooperation in this matter."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Crenshaw: "Yes, sir."</blockquote>

Dr. Crenshaw said that he relayed Johnson's message to Dr. Shires, but that Oswald was in no condition to give any statement.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[Crenshaw, Charles]]. ''Trauma Room One'', (New York: Paraview Press, 2001), pp. 132-133. ISBN 1931044309</ref>

===Cuban government conspiracy===
The Warren Commission reported that they investigated "dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial contact between Oswald and agents of the Cuban Government" and that they found no evidence that Cuba was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.{{sfn|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|pp=305, 374}} The House Select Committee on Assassinations also wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Cuban Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy".<ref name="HCSA-IC"/>

Conspiracy theories frequently implicate [[Fidel Castro]] as having ordered the assassination of Kennedy in retaliation for the CIA's previous attempts to assassinate him.{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=208}}<!-- Source needed for Castro denying this. -->

In the early 1960s, [[Clare Booth Luce]], wife of [[Time-Life]] publisher [[Henry Luce]], was one of a number of prominent Americans who sponsored anti-Castro groups. This support included funding exiles in commando speedboat raids against Cuba. In 1975, Clare Luce said that on the night of the assassination, she received a call from a member of a commando group she had sponsored. According to Luce, the caller's name was "something like" Julio Fernandez and he claimed he was calling her from New Orleans.{{sfn|Summers|2013|p=392-}}<ref>Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), pp. 53<U+2013>54. ISBN 1-56025-052-6</ref>

According to Luce, Fernandez told her that Oswald had approached his group with an offer to help assassinate Castro. Fernandez further claimed that he and his associates eventually found out that Oswald was a communist and supporter of Castro. He said that with this new-found knowledge, his group kept a close watch on Oswald until Oswald suddenly came into money and went to [[Mexico City]] and then Dallas.<ref>Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 54. ISBN 1-56025-052-6</ref> Finally, according to Luce, Fernandez told her, "There is a Cuban Communist assassination team at large and Oswald was their hired gun."{{sfn|Summers|1998|p=323}}

Luce said that she told the caller to give his information to the FBI. Subsequently, Luce would reveal the details of the incident to both the [[Church Committee]] and the HSCA. Both committees investigated the incident, but were unable to uncover any evidence to corroborate the allegations.<ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0044a.htm Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations] Appendix to Hearings, Vol. X, pp. 83<U+2013>87.</ref>

In May 1967, CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] told President Lyndon Johnson that the CIA had tried to assassinate Castro. Helms further stated that the CIA had employed members of the Mafia in this effort, and "...that CIA plots to assassinate Fidel Castro dated back to August of 1960<U+2014>to the Eisenhower Administration." Helms also said that the plots against Castro continued into the Kennedy Administration and that Attorney General Robert Kennedy had known about both the plots and the Mafia's involvement.<ref name="theatlantic.com">[http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200406/holland The Assassination Tapes, by Max Holland] The Atlantic Monthly, June 2004</ref>

On separate occasions, Johnson told two prominent television newsmen that he believed that JFK's assassination had been organized by Castro as retaliation for the CIA's efforts to kill Castro. In October 1968, Johnson told veteran newsman [[Howard K. Smith]] of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] that "Kennedy was trying to get to Castro, but Castro got to him first." In September 1969, in an interview with [[Walter Cronkite]] of [[CBS]], Johnson said that in regard to the assassination he could not "honestly say that I've ever been completely relieved of the fact that there might have been international connections," and referenced unnamed "others." Finally, in 1971, Johnson told his former speechwriter Leo Janos of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine that he "never believed that Oswald acted alone".<ref name="theatlantic.com"/>

In 1977, Castro was interviewed by newsman [[Bill Moyers]]. Castro denied any involvement in Kennedy's death, saying:

<blockquote>It would have been absolute insanity by Cuba.... It would have been a provocation. Needless to say, it would have been to run the risk that our country would have been destroyed by the United States. Nobody who's not insane could have thought about [killing Kennedy in retaliation].<ref name="Bill Moyers 1977"/>{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=154}}</blockquote>

President Lyndon Johnson also implicated the CIA in the assassination. According to a FBI document released in 1977, Johnson's postmaster general, Marvin Watson told the FBI "...that [Johnson] was now convinced there was a plot in connection with the assassination. Watson stated the President felt the CIA had something to do with this plot."<ref>DeLoach to Watson, FBI document 44-24696, April 4, 1967.</ref><ref>[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/vol6/html/ChurchV6_0096b.htm Testimony of Courtney Evans and Cartha DeLoach], Church Committee Reports, vol. 6, Federal Bureau of Investigation, p. 182.</ref>{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=298}}<ref>''The Washington Post'', December 13, 1977.</ref>

Kennedy, Chapter 6|1964|p=374}} The House Select Committee on Assassinations also wrote: "The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Soviet Government was not involved in the assassination of President Kennedy".<ref name="HCSA-IC"/>

According to some conspiracy theorists, the Soviet Union, with [[Nikita Khrushchev]] motivated by having to back down during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], was responsible for the assassination.{{sfn|Broderick|2008|p=208}}

According to a 1966 FBI document, Colonel Boris Ivanov<U+2014>chief of the KGB at the time of the assassination<U+2014>stated that it was his personal opinion that the assassination had been planned by an organized group, rather than a lone individual. The same document stated, "...officials of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed there was some well-organized conspiracy on the part of the 'ultraright' in the United States to effect a '[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup]].'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~oah/nl/98feb/jfk.html#d1 |title=JFK Assassination Records Review Board Releases Top Secret Records |publisher=Indiana.edu |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref>

Much later, the highest-ranking [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]] intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] said that he had a conversation with [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]] who told him about "ten international leaders the [[Kremlin]] killed or tried to kill": "[[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Rajk]] and [[Imre Nagy]] of Hungary; [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]] and [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej|Gheorghiu-Dej]] in Romania; [[Rudolf Sl<U+00E1>nsk<U+00FD>]], the head of [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Jan Masaryk]], that country's chief diplomat; the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]; [[Palmiro Togliatti]] of Italy; American President John F. Kennedy; and [[Mao Zedong]]." Pacepa provided some additional details, such as a plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of [[Lin Biao]] organized by KGB and claimed that "among the leaders of Moscow's satellite intelligence services there was unanimous agreement that the KGB had been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy."<ref name="Pacepa0">[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ= "The Kremlin<U+2019>s Killing Ways"], Ion Mihai Pacepa, [[National Review Online]], November 28, 2006</ref> Pacepa later released a book, ''Programmed to Kill: Lee Harvey Oswald, the Soviet KGB, and the Kennedy Assassination'', in 2007.

===Decoy hearse and wound alteration===
[[David Lifton]] presented a scenario in which conspirators on [[Air Force One]] removed Kennedy's body from its original bronze casket and placed it in a shipping casket, while en route from Dallas to Washington. Once the presidential plane arrived at [[Andrews Air Force Base]], the shipping casket with the President's body in it was surreptitiously taken by helicopter from the side of the plane that was out of the television camera's view. Kennedy's body was then taken to an unknown location<U+2014>most likely [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]<ref>[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]].

Part of Lifton's theory comes from a House Select Committee on Assassinations report of an interview of Lt. Richard Lipsey on January 18, 1978 by committee staff members Donald Purdy and Mark Flanagan. According to the report, Lt. Richard Lipsey said that he and General Wehle had met President Kennedy's body at Andrews Air Force Base. Lipsey "...placed [the casket] in a hearse to be transported to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Lipsey mentioned that he and Wehle then flew by helicopter to Bethesda and took [the body of] JFK into the back of Bethesda." Lipsey said that "a decoy hearse had been driven to the front [of Bethesda]."<ref>[http://karws.gso.uri.edu/Marsh/Jfk-conspiracy/LIPSEY.TXT Interview of Lt. Richard A. Lipsey], by House Select Committee on Assassinations investigators Andy Purdy and Mark Flanagan, JFK Document No. 014469, January 18, 1978.</ref> With Lipsey's mention of a "decoy hearse" at Bethesda, Lifton theorized that the casket removed by Lipsey from Air Force One<U+2014>from the side of the plane exposed to television<U+2014>was probably also a decoy and was likely empty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/arrb/index38.htm |title=Testimony of David Lifton |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]].

Laboratory technologist Paul O'Connor was one of the major witnesses supporting another part of David Lifton's theory that somewhere between Parkland and Bethesda the President's body was made to appear as if it had been shot only from the rear. O'Connor said that President Kennedy's body arrived at Bethesda inside a body bag in "a cheap, shipping-type of casket", which differed from the description of the ornamental bronze casket and sheet that the body had been wrapped in at Parkland Hospital.<ref name="Turner, Nigel 1988">Turner, Nigel. ''The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 1, "The Coup D'Etat"'', 1988.</ref> O'Connor said that the brain had already been removed by the time it got to Bethesda,<ref name="Turner, Nigel 1988"/> and that there were "just little pieces" of brain matter left inside the skull.<ref>[[David Lifton|Lifton, David]]. ''Best Evidence: Disquise and Deception in the Assassination of John F. Kennedy'', (New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers, 1988), p. 604. ISBN 0-88184-438-1</ref>

Researcher [[David Wrone]] dismissed the theory that Kennedy's body was surreptitiously removed from the presidential plane, stating that as is done with all cargo on airplanes for safety precautions, the coffin and lid were held by steel wrapping cables to prevent shifting during takeoff and landing and in case of air disturbances in flight.<ref name="Wrone"/> According to Wrone, the side of the plane away from the television camera "was bathed in klieg lights, and thousands of persons watched along the fence that bent backward along that side, providing, in effect, a well-lit and very public stage for any would-be body snatchers".<ref name="Wrone"/>

===Federal Reserve conspiracy===
Jim Marrs, in his book ''Crossfire'', presented the theory that Kennedy was trying to rein in the power of the [[Federal Reserve]], and that forces opposed to such action might have played at least some part in the assassination.{{sfn|Marrs|1989|p=275}}<ref name=Silber>{{cite journal|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|title=The Fed and Its Enemies; The central bank is at the center of controversy.

A 2010 article in ''[[Research (magazine)|Research]]'' magazine discussing various controversies surrounding the Federal Reserve stated that "the wildest accusation against the Fed is that it was involved in Kennedy's assassination."<ref name=Silber/> Critics of the theory note that Kennedy called for and signed legislation phasing out Silver Certificates in favor of Federal Reserve Notes, thereby enhancing the power of the Federal Reserve; and that Executive Order 11110 was a technicality that only delegated existing presidential powers to the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] for administrative convenience during a period of transition.<ref name=Silber/><ref name="Woodward 1996"/>

===Israeli government conspiracy===
Immediately following Kennedy's death, speculation that he was assassinated by a "[[Antisemitic conspiracy theories|Zionist conspiracy]]" was prevalent in much of the [[Arab world]] and the [[Middle East]].<ref name=Bass>{{cite book|last=Bass|first=Warren|title=Support Any Friend: Kennedy's Middle East and the Making of the U.S.-Israel Alliance|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199884315|pages=243<U+2013>244|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=npk0XuEHHpQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 16, 2013|chapter=A Time To Cut Bait|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=npk0XuEHHpQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA243#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Among these views were that [[Zionist]]s were motivated to kill Kennedy due to his opposition to an [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israeli nuclear program]], that Lyndon B. Johnson received orders from Zionists to have Kennedy killed, and that the assassin was a Zionist agent.<ref name=Bass/>

According to [[Michael Collins Piper]] in ''Final Judgment: The Missing Link in the JFK Assassination Controversy'', Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] orchestrated the assassination after learning that Kennedy planned to keep Israel from obtaining nuclear weapons.<ref name=Goldwag>{{cite book|last=Goldwag|first=Arthur|title=Cults, Conspiracies, and Secret Societies: The Straight Scoop on Freemasons, the Illmuniati, Skull & Bones, Black Helicopters, the New World Order, and Many, Many More|year=2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780307456663|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DDbM5GeMgXIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 16, 2013|page=178|chapter=Conspiracies: The Kennedy Assassinations|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=DDbM5GeMgXIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA178#v=onepage&q&f=false|month=August}}</ref> Piper said that the assassination "was a joint enterprise conducted on the highest levels of the American CIA, in collaboration with organized crime<U+2014>and most specifically, with direct and profound involvement by the Israeli intelligence service, the [[Mossad]]."<ref>{{cite news|title=College lecturers blame JFK's death on Israelis|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z1IpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MmsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3861%2C3207784|accessdate=January 16, 2013|newspaper=Sun Journal|date=August 22, 1997|agency=AP|location=Lewiston, Maine|page=7A}}</ref> The theory also alleges involvement of [[Meyer Lansky]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]].<ref name=Goldwag/> In 2004, [[Mordechai Vanunu]] stated that the assassination was Israel's response to "pressure [Kennedy] exerted on...

==Other published theories==

*''Appointment in Dallas'' (1975) by Hugh McDonald suggests that Oswald was lured into a plot that he was told was a staged fake attempt to kill JFK to embarrass the Secret Service and to alert the government of the necessity for beefed-up Secret Service security. Oswald<U+2019>s role was to shoot at the motorcade but deliberately miss the target. The plotters then killed JFK themselves and framed Oswald for the crime. McDonald claims that, after being told the "truth" about JFK's death by CIA agent Herman Kimsey in 1964, he spent years trying to locate a man known as <U+201C>Saul.<U+201D> Saul was supposedly the unidentified man who was photographed exiting the Russian embassy in Mexico City in September 1963, whose photos were subsequently sent to the FBI in Dallas on the morning of November 22, 1963 (before the assassination), and mislabelled "Lee Harvey Oswald". McDonald claims to have finally tracked Saul down in London in 1972 at which time Saul revealed the details of the plot to him.
*''Reasonable Doubt'' (1985) by Henry Hurt, who writes about his Warren Commission doubts. Mr. Hurt pins the plot on professional crook Robert Easterling, along with Texas oilmen and the supposed Ferrie/Shaw alliance. ISBN 0-03-004059-0.
*''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991) by William Cooper alleges that Kennedy was shot by the Presidential limousine's driver, Secret Service agent William Greer. In the Zapruder film, Greer can be seen turning to his right and looking backwards just before speeding away from Dealey Plaza. This theory has come under severe criticism from others in the research community.<ref>JFK Lancer, [http://www.jfklancer.com/greer.html ''Did the Limousine driver shoot JFK?''],</ref> ISBN 0-929385-22-5.
*Mark North's ''Act of Treason: The Role of J. Edgar Hoover in the assassination of President Kennedy,'' (1991) implicates the FBI Director. North documents that Hoover was aware of threats against Kennedy by organized crime before 1963, and suggests that he failed to take proper action to prevent the assassination. North also charges Hoover with failure to work adequately to uncover the truth behind Kennedy's murder. ISBN 0-88184-877-8.
* ''[[Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK]]'' (1992) by Bonar Menninger (ISBN 0-312-08074-3) alleges that while Oswald did attempt to assassinate JFK and did succeed in mortally wounding him, the fatal shot was accidentally fired by Secret Service agent [[George Hickey]], who was riding in the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind the Presidential Limousine. The theory alleges that after the first two shots were fired the motorcade sped up while Hickey was attempting to respond to Oswald's shots and he lost his balance and accidentally pulled the trigger of his [[AR-15]] and shot JFK. Hickey's testimony says otherwise: "''At the end of the last report'' (shot) I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, ''and turned to the rear.''" (italics added).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jfkassassination.net/russ/m_j_russ/Sa-hicke.htm |title=George Hickey<U+00B4>s Warren Commission testimony |publisher=Jfkassassination.net |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref> George Hickey sued Menninger in April 1995 for what he had written in ''Mortal Error''. The case was dismissed as its [[statute of limitations]] had run out.
*''Who Shot JFK? : A Guide to the Major Conspiracy Theories'' (1993) by Bob Callahan and Mark Zingarelli explores some of the more obscure theories regarding JFK's murder, such as "The Coca-Cola Theory." According to this theory, suggested by the editor of an organic gardening magazine, Oswald killed JFK due to mental impairment stemming from an addiction to refined sugar, as evidenced by his need for his favorite beverage immediately after the assassination. ISBN 0-671-79494-9.
*''Passport to Assassination'' (1993) by Oleg M. Nechiporenko, the Soviet consular official (and highly placed KGB officer) who met with Oswald in Mexico City in 1963. He was afforded the unique opportunity to interview Oswald about his goals including his genuine desire for a Cuban visa. His conclusions were: (1) that Oswald killed Kennedy due to extreme feelings of inadequacy versus his wife<U+2019>s professed admiration for JFK, and (2) that the KGB never sought intelligence information from Oswald during his time in the USSR as they did not trust his motivations. ISBN 1-55972-210-X.
*[[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery]]'' (1995) concludes that Oswald was guilty, but holds that the evidence may point to a second gunman on the grassy knoll, who, purely by coincidence, was attempting to kill JFK at the same time as Oswald. "If there was indeed another shot, it was not necessarily fired by a conspirator of Oswald's. Such a gun could have belonged to another lone killer or to a conspirator working for some other group altogether."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/forum/mailer.html |title=pbs.org |publisher=pbs.org |date=November 20, 2003 |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref> ISBN 0-679-42535-7.

*''JFK: The Second Plot'' (2002) by Matthew Smith explores the strange case of Roscoe White. In 1990, Roscoe's son Ricky made public a claim that his father, who had been a Dallas police officer in 1963, was involved in killing the president. Roscoe's widow Geneva also claimed that before her husband's death in 1971 he left a diary in which he claims he was one of the marksmen who shot the President, and that he also killed [[J. D. Tippit|Officer J. D. Tippit]]. ISBN 1-84018-501-5.
*David Wrone's ''The Zapruder Film'' (2003) concludes that the shot that killed JFK came from in front of the limousine, and that JFK's throat and back wounds were caused by an in-and-through shot originating from the grassy knoll. Three shots were fired from three different angles, none of them from Lee Harvey Oswald's window at the Texas School Book Depository. Wrone is a professor of history (emeritus) at the University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Stevens Point. ISBN 0-7006-1291-2.
*''The [[Gemstone File]]: A Memoir'' (2006), by Stephanie Caruana, posits that Oswald was part of a 28-man assassination team which included three U.S. Mafia hitmen ([[Jimmy Fratianno]], John Roselli, and [[Eugene Brading]]). Oswald's role was to shoot John Connally. Bruce Roberts, author of the Gemstone File papers, claimed that the JFK assassination scenario was modeled after a supposed attempted assassination of President F.D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt was riding in an open car with Mayor [[Anton Cermak]] of Chicago. Cermak was shot and killed by [[Giuseppe Zangara]]. In Dallas, JFK was the real target, and Connally was a secondary target. The JFK assassination is only a small part of the Gemstone File's account. ISBN 1-4120-6137-7.
*[[Joseph P. Farrell]]'s ''LBJ and the Conspiracy to Kill Kennedy'' (2011) attempts to show multiple interests had reasons to remove President Kennedy: The military, CIA, NASA, anti-Castro factions, Hoover's FBI and others. He concludes that the person that allowed all of these groups to form a "coalescence of interests" was Vice President Lyndon Johnson. ISBN 978-1-935487-18-0
* In "Allegations of PFC Eugene Dinkin",<ref>{{cite news|title=Allegations of PFC Dinkin| url=http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Allegations_of_PFC_Eugene_Dinkin}}</ref> the Mary Farrell Foundation summarizes and archives documents related to Private First Class Eugene B. Dinkin, a cryptographic code operator stationed in [[Metz, France]], who went [[AWOL]] in early November 1963, entered Switzerland using a false ID, and visited the United Nations' press office and declared that officials in the U.S. government were planning to assassinate President Kennedy, adding that "something" might happen to the Commander in Chief in Texas. Dinkin was arrested nine days before Kennedy was killed, placed in psychiatric care (deemed a mad man?), and released shortly thereafter. His allegations eventually made their way to the Warren Commission, but, according to the Ferrell Foundation account, the Commission "took no interest in the matter, and indeed omitted any mention of Dinkin from its purportedly encyclopedic 26 volumes of evidence."<ref>{{cite news|title= Mad Men JFK Assassination - Mad Men Pfc.
