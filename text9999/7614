'''John Bruce "Jack" Thompson''' (born July 25, 1951) is an [[United States|American]] [[activist]] and [[disbarred]] [[Lawyer|attorney]], based in [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[Florida]]. Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2007/04/va_tech_dr_phil_jack_thompson.html |title=Va.

During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as [[obscenity]] in modern culture. This included [[rap music]], broadcasts by [[shock jock]] [[Howard Stern]], the content of [[computer and video games]] and their alleged effects on children.<ref name="RollingStoneMag">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Kushner |title=Gaming's Worst Bully |journal=[[Rolling Stone Magazine]] |date=2006-11-16}}</ref>

He is also known for his bizarre filings to the [[Florida Bar]], including challenging the constitutionality of the Florida Bar itself in 1993.<ref name="TheRecorder" /> Later the Florida Supreme Court would describe his filings as "repetitive, frivolous and insulting to the integrity of the court".<ref name="ShowCause" /> On March 20, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court imposed sanctions on Thompson, requiring that any of his future filings in the court be signed by a member of the Florida Bar other than himself.<ref name="floridasupremecourt.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2008/sc07-80.pdf |title=SC07-80 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref>

In July 2008, Thompson was permanently [[Disbarment|disbarred]] by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] for inappropriate conduct, including making false statements to [[tribunal]]s and disparaging and humiliating litigants.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jack Thompson Disbarred |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=25 September 2008 |url=http://kotaku.com/5054772/jack-thompson-disbarred |publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}</ref><ref name="law.com">{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Ostrovsky |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1170928966137 |title=Fla.

==Background==

Thompson grew up in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and attended [[Denison University]]. He received media attention when he hosted his own political talk show on the college radio station.<ref name="PrivateSting">Haring, Bruce. "The 'Private Sting' of Jack Thompson." ''Billboard'', 1990-08-11</ref> He then attended [[Vanderbilt University]] [[Vanderbilt University Law School|Law School]], where he met his wife, Patricia.<ref name="Batman">Philips, Chuck.

''Los Angeles Times'', 1990-06-18</ref> In 1976 they moved to [[Florida]], where Thompson, working as a lawyer and then a fund-raiser for a Christian ministry,<ref name="Batman" /> began attending the [[Key Biscayne]] [[Presbyterian Church]] and became a [[born-again Christian]].<ref name="PrivateSting" /> Thompson admits to having a "colorful disciplinary history" as an attorney.<ref name="Linn">Linn, Mike.

==The Neil Rogers Show==
In 1988 Thompson became involved in a feud with [[WIOD]] Radio host [[Neil Rogers]], after Thompson was instrumental in persuading the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] to fine WIOD $10,000 for airing such parody songs as [[Uncle Bonsai|"Boys Want Sex in the Morning"]] on Rogers' show.<ref name="PrivateSting"/> Thompson also sued the station for violating a December 1987 agreement to end on-air harassment against him. Thompson had complained to the station after Rogers solicited gay people to join Thompson on his vacation; Rogers aired Thompson<U+2019>s address and phone number.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} For the next eight months, Thompson recorded all of Rogers' broadcasts and documented 40,000 mentionings of his name. Thompson claimed that one of the terms of his agreement with the station was that the station would pay him $5,000 each time his name was mentioned, totaling $200 million in the suit.<ref name="ABA">{{cite journal |first=Nancy |last=Blodgett |title=Say 'Jack' 40,000 Times |journal=ABA Journal |date=1988-10-01 |publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref>

==Janet Reno==

Thompson first met [[Janet Reno]] in November 1975, when he applied for a job as an assistant [[State's Attorney]] in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]], but was not hired.<ref name="outofharmsway">{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Thompson |title=Out of Harm's Way: One Man's Relentless Crusade to Topple Media Giants and Save Your Kids from Video Game Madness |location=[[Wheaton, Illinois]] |publisher=[[Tyndale House|Tyndale House Publishers, Inc]] |year=2005 |isbn=9781414304427 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=yXNmM1xRCf8C}}</ref> In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers.<ref name="Evans">Evans, Christine. "Challenger attacks Reno as too liberal." ''The Miami Herald'', 1B, November 6, 1988.</ref> Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Thompson said that Reno then put her hand on his shoulder and responded, "I'm only interested in virile men. That<U+2019>s why I'm not attracted to you."<ref name="Vick">Vick, Karl and David Dahl.

She didn't hurt me; but I was annoyed<U+2014>I was angry<U+2014>that she dealt with it in that fashion. And that was<U+2014>that was a mistake; I shouldn't have done that. I should have<U+2014>but I'm glad<U+2014>I<U+2014>I think it was reasonable to ask her the questions."}}</ref> He filed a police report accusing her of [[battery (crime)|battery]] for touching him. In response, Reno asked Florida governor [[Bob Martinez]] to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate.<ref name="Battery">"Opponent accuses Reno of battery." ''The Miami Herald'', 2D, September 9, 1988.</ref> The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was "a political ploy." Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]], leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor [[Buddy MacKay]], to dismiss him as a "kook."<ref name="Vick" />

In 1990, after his election loss, Thompson began a campaign against the efforts of [[Switchboard of Miami]], a social services group of which Reno was a board member. Thompson charged that the group placed "homosexual-education tapes" in public schools. Switchboard responded by getting the [[Florida Supreme Court]] to order that he submit to a psychiatric examination. Thompson did so and passed. Thompson has since stated on more than one occasion that he is "the only officially certified sane lawyer in the entire state of Florida."<ref name="Timmerman">Timmerman, Kenneth R. "Reno Redux in Florida." ''Insight'', October 5, 2001.</ref>

==Rap music==

Thompson came to national prominence in the controversy over [[2 Live Crew]]'s ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]'' album. ([[Luke Records|Luke Skyywalker Records]], the company of 2 Live Crew's [[Luther Campbell]], had previously released a record supporting Reno in her race against Thompson.)<ref name="OntheBeat">Harrington, Richard. "On the Beat; In Md., the Sound and the Fury." ''The Washington Post'', 1990-01-31.</ref> On January 1, 1990, he wrote to Martinez and Reno asking them to investigate whether the album violated Florida obscenity laws. Although the state prosecutor declined to proceed with an investigation, Thompson pushed local officials in various parts of the state to block sales of the album, along with [[N.W.A]]<U+2019>s ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]''.<ref name="Philips1">Philips, Chuck. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60010849.html?FMT=ABS 2 Live Crew's 'Nasty Lyrics' a Bum Rap?]" ''Los Angeles Times'', March 7, 1990.</ref> In sending documents to opponents, Thompson would frequently attach a photocopy of his driver's license, with a photo of [[Batman]] pasted over his own. Thompson said, "I have sent my opponents pictures of Batman to remind them I'm playing the role of Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne helped the police in the movie, I have had to assist the sheriff of Broward County." He also wore a Batman wristwatch.<ref name="Batman2">Parker, Laura. "Sheriff's Crackdown on Rap Puts Unlikely County in Spotlight." ''The Washington Post'', 1990-06-17.</ref> Thompson compared Campbell to the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].<ref name="Batman3">Kohn, Marek. "Very nasty indeed; Brutal and sexually explicit, the raps of 2 Live Crew have outraged US fundamentalists, but their ghetto origins have confused the liberal conscience." ''The Independent'', 1990-09-16.</ref> Thompson also said, "I understand as well as anybody that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] is a cornerstone of a free society<U+2014>but there is a responsibility to people who can be harmed by words and thoughts, one of which is the message from Campbell that women can be sexually abused."<ref name="PrivateSting" />

Thompson also took issue with another 2 Live Crew song, ''[[Banned in the USA]]''.  Thompson sent a letter to [[Jon Landau]], manager of [[Bruce Springsteen]], whose song ''[[Born in the USA]]'' was to be sampled by the group.  Thompson suggested that Landau "protect ''Born in the U.S.A.'' from its apparent theft by a bunch of clowns who traffic toxic waste to kids," or else Thompson would "be telling the nation about Mr. Springsteen's tacit approval" of the song, which, according to Campbell, "expresses anger about the failure of the First Amendment to protect 2 Live Crew from prosecution."<ref name="BannedUSA">Harrington, Richard. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72601883.html?FMT=ABS Banned in the U.S.A.' Released as Rap Group Faces 'Nasty' Charges]." ''The Washington Post'', July 4, 1990.</ref>  Thompson also said, "the 'social commentary' on this album is akin to a sociopath's discharging his [[AK-47]] into a crowded schoolyard, with the machine gun bursts interrupted by [[Pee-wee Herman]]'s views on politics."<ref name="BannedUSA2">Harrington, Richard. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72606729.html?FMT=ABS The Crew: Courage or Crime?]" ''The Washington Post'', August 1, 1990.</ref>

The members of 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] sheriff in federal district court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album could result in a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional [[prior restraint]] on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact [[Miller test|obscene]]. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.<ref name="Luke">''Luke Records Inc. v. Navarro'', 960 F.2d 134 (11th Cir. 1992).</ref>

As the debate continued, Thompson wrote, "An industry that says a line cannot be drawn will be drawn and quartered."<ref name="Billboard">Thompson, Jack. "Clean Up Record Lyrics<U+2014>Or Else." ''Billboard'', October 6, 1990.</ref> He said of his campaign, "I won't stop till I get the head of a record company or record chain in jail. Only then will they stop trafficking in obscenity."<ref name="Cox">Cox, Meg. "Music Industry Composes Counterpoint as Demands to Censor Lyrics Increase." ''The Wall Street Journal'', 1990-10-19.</ref> [[Bob Guccione Jr.]], founder of ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'' magazine, responded by calling Thompson "a sort of latter-day [[Don Quixote]], as equally at odds with his times as that mythical character was," and argued that his campaign was achieving "two things...: pissing everybody off and compounding his own celebrity."<ref name="Guccione">Guccione, Bob Jr. "Nothing Should Be Legally Obscene." ''Billboard'', December 8, 1990.</ref> Thompson responded by noting, "Law enforcement and I put 2 Live Crew's career back into the toilet where it began."<ref name="GuccioneResponse">Thompson, Jack. "Morals Are Slipping." ''Billboard'', 1991-01-12.</ref>

Thompson wrote another letter in 1991, this time to the Minnesota attorney general [[Hubert H. Humphrey III]], complaining about the N.W.A album ''[[Efil4zaggin]]''. Humphrey warned locally-based [[Musicland]] that sales of the album might violate state law against distribution of sexually explicit material harmful to minors. Humphrey also referred the matter to the Minneapolis city attorney, who concluded that some of the songs might fit the legal definition if issued as singles, but that sales of the album as a whole were not prosecutable.<ref name="Harrington1">Harrington, Richard. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74733170.html?FMT=ABS Brewer<U+2019>s Ads Rapped]." ''Washington Post'', September 4, 1991.</ref> Thompson also initiated a similar campaign in Boston.<ref name="Reibman">Reibman, Greg. "Anti-obscenity lawyer looks to get rap group N.W.A banned in Boston." ''Boston Herald'', August 9, 1991.</ref> Later, Thompson would criticize the Republican Party for inviting N.W.A member and party donor [[Eazy-E|Eric "Eazy-E" Wright]] to an exclusive function.<ref name="Philips2">Philips, Chuck. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61145221.html?FMT=ABS Rodney King Gets Rap Offer]." ''Los Angeles Times'', 1991-03-20.</ref>

In 1992, Thompson was hired by the Freedom Alliance, a self-described patriot group founded by [[Oliver North]], described as "[[right-wing politics|far-right]]" by the [[Washington Post]].  <!-- See below source on Time Warner in the Line of Fire -->  By this time, Thompson was looking to have [[Time Warner]], then being criticized for promoting the [[Ice-T]] song ''[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]'', prosecuted for federal and state crimes such as [[sedition]], incitement to riot, and "advocating overthrow of government" by distributing material that, in Thompson's view, advocated the killing of police officers.<ref name="Harrington2">Harrington, Richard. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74035960.html?FMT=ABS Time Warner in the Line of Fire]." ''Washington Post'', July 8, 1992.</ref> Time Warner eventually released Ice-T and his band from their contract, and voluntarily suspended distribution of the album on which ''Cop Killer'' was featured.

Thompson<U+2019>s push to label various musical performances obscene was not entirely limited to rap. In addition to taking on 2 Live Crew, Thompson campaigned against sales of the racy music video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''[[Justify My Love]]''.<ref name="Philips3">Philips, Chuck. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60990399.html?FMT=ABS Anger Over Madonna Single]." ''Los Angeles Times'', January 4, 1991.</ref> Then in 1996, he took on [[MTV]] broadcasts for "objectification of women" by writing to the station's corporate parent, [[Viacom]], demanding a stop to what he called "corporate pollution."<ref name="Sandler">Sandler, Adam. "CLEAN UP MY MTV?" ''Daily Variety'', 1996-12-24.</ref> He also went after MTV's advertisers and urged the [[U.S. Army]] to pull recruiting commercials, citing the Army<U+2019>s recruitment of women and problems with sexual harassment scandals.<ref name="Sandler2">Sandler, Adam. "Activist demands MTV pull Army ads." ''Daily Variety'', 1997-02-19.</ref>

==Video games==

More recently, Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors.  His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as "murder simulators" to rehearse violent plans.  He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers."<ref name="EveryShooting">"Excerpt from '20/20' on the Debate Whether Violent Video Games Desensitize Children." ''World News Now'', ABC, 2000-03-23.</ref> Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and [[Copycat crimes|copycat]] behavior.<ref name="Tribune">Thompson, Jack. "Violent video games feed unhealthy ideas to young kids." ''Tacoma News Tribune'', January 8, 2006.</ref><ref>The idea of a causal link between video games and violence has been challenged.  For example, {{cite web|title=Jack Thompson Watch: Sics Feds on Kotaku, Versus [[Paul Levinson]]|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/04/jack_thompson_w.html|publisher=WIRED|author= Chris Kohler|date=2007-04-24|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> According to Thompson, "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain."<ref name="Drew">Drew, James. "[http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041121/NEWS08/411210370/0/NEWS Ohio sniper case may put video games on trial]." ''Toledo Blade'', 2004-11-21.</ref> Thompson has described the proliferation of games by [[Sony]], a Japanese company, as "[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] 2."<ref name="Lasker">Lasker, John. "[http://www.daytoncitypaper.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2399 MURDER SIMULATORS? Railing against video game violence isn't just for Jack Thompson anymore]{{dead link|date=November 2009}}." ''Dayton City Paper'', January 4, 2006.</ref> According to Thompson, "Many parents think that stores won<U+2019>t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked."<ref name="Cooper360">Cooper, Anderson. ''Anderson Cooper 360''. CNN, October 8, 2005.</ref>

Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by [[freedom of expression]], saying, "Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They<U+2019>re not even speech. They<U+2019>re dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it," as well as simply calling video games "mental masturbation".<ref name="Benedetti" /> In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking "for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end."<ref name="DenverPost">Thompson, Jack. "Bloodlust video games put kids in the crosshairs." ''Denver Post'', 1999-05-30.</ref> Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and [[simulation]] technologies, such as those being developed at the [[Institute for Creative Technologies]], which, he suggests, were created by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill.<ref name="Worthy">Worthy, Kym. "Why violent video games may be worse than other media violence." ''Michigan Chronicle'', October 5, 2005.</ref>  He also claims that the [[PlayStation 2]]'s [[DualShock]] controller "gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is [[operant conditioning]], [[behavior modification]] right out of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s laboratory."<ref name="ShreveportTimesOpEd">Thompson, Jack.

''Shreveport Times'', 2006-05-24.</ref>

Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an [[aggravated murder]] case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around [[Columbus, Ohio]]. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of ''[[The Getaway (video game)|The Getaway]]'' were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a [[search warrant]] for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games ''[[State of Emergency (video game)|State of Emergency]]'', ''[[Max Payne]]'', and ''[[Dead to Rights]]''. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an [[insanity defense]] based on [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the "functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,"<ref name="Drew " /> and "the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense."<ref name="NancyGrace">"Nancy Grace for April 21, 2005, CNNHN." ''Nancy Grace'', CNN, 2005-04-21.</ref>

===Early litigation===

Thompson filed a lawsuit on behalf of the parents of three children killed in the [[Heath High School shooting]] in 1997. Investigations showed that the perpetrator, 14-year-old Michael Carneal, had regularly played various computer games (including ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (series)|Quake]]'', ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[Redneck Rampage]]'', ''[[Nightmare Creatures]]'', ''[[MechWarrior (video game series)|MechWarrior]]'', and ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'') and accessed some pornographic websites. Carneal had also owned a videotape of ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]'', which includes a high school student dreaming about shooting his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the Internet sites were [[negligence|negligent]] in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence. Additional claims included [[product liability]] for making "defective" products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] for distributing this material to minors.<ref name="James1">''[[James v. Meow Media]]'', 90 F. Supp. 2d 798 (W.D. Ky. 2000).</ref> Said Thompson, "We intend to hurt Hollywood. We intend to hurt the video game industry. We intend to hurt the sex porn sites."<ref name="Prichard">Prichard, James. "Parents of slain students sue entertainment industry companies." ''The Associated Press State & Local Wire'', 1999-04-12.</ref>

The suit was filed in federal district court and was dismissed for failing to present a legally recognizable claim. The court concluded that Carneal's actions were not reasonably foreseeable by the defendants and that in any case, his actions superseded those of the defendants, so that the latter could not be the [[proximate cause]] of the harm. In addition, the judge determined that "thoughts, ideas and images" in the defendants' materials did not constitute "products" that could be considered defective.<ref name="James1" /> The ruling was upheld on appeal.<ref name="James2">''James v. Meow Media'', 300 F.3d 683 (6th Cir. 2002)</ref>

===''Grand Theft Auto''===

In February 2003, Thompson asked permission to file an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' (or "friend of the court") brief in the Ohio case of [[Dustin Lynch]], 16, who was charged with aggravated murder in the death of JoLynn Mishne; Lynch was "obsessed" with ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''.<ref name="Hudak">Hudak, Stephen. "Should video game share blame? Father of slain Medina girl says manufacturer is accomplice." ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', 2003-02-21.</ref> When Judge John Lohn ruled that Lynch would be tried as an adult, Thompson passed a message from Mishne's father to the judge, asserting that "the attorneys had better tell the jury about the violent video game that trained this kid [and] showed him how to kill our daughter, JoLynn. If they don't, I will.<U+201D><ref name="Hudak2">Hudak, Stephen. 'State gets; OK to try teenager as adult 16-year-old accused of killing Medina girl." ''The Plain Dealer'', 2003-05-13.</ref> In a motion sent to the prosecutor, the boy's court-appointed lawyer, and to reporters, Thompson asked to be recognized as the boy's lawyer in the case. However, Medina County Prosecutor Dean Holman said Thompson would be faced with deeply conflicting interests if he were to represent Dustin Lynch because he also advised Mishne's parents.<ref name="Hudak3">Hudak, Stephen. "Lawyer's motive in teen murder trial debated." ''The Plain Dealer'', June 7, 2003.</ref> Claiming that delays had weakened his case, Jack Thompson asked Medina County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Collier to disqualify himself from presiding over the case because the judge had not ruled on Thompson's request for two months.<ref name="Hudak4">Hudak, Stephen. "Lawyer wants in, wants judge out in murder case of Medina teen." ''The Plain Dealer'', 2003-08-19.</ref> Lynch himself eventually rejected Thompson's offer, withdrawing his insanity plea. Lynch's mother, Jerrilyn Thomas, who previously demanded that Judge Christopher Collier appoint Thompson to defend her son, said she changed her mind after visiting with her boy in jail, saying, "It has nothing to do with video games or [[Paxil]], and my son's no murderer."<ref name="Hudak5">Hudak, Stephen. "Teen can stand trial in girl's murder; Father of slain Medina High pupil upset that video game critic won<U+2019>t be in court." ''The Plain Dealer'', 2003-09-16.</ref>

Thompson returned to file a lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 on behalf of the victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pled guilty to reckless homicide, endangerment, and assault.<ref name="TNstatecase">''Hamel, et al. v. Sony Computer Ent., et al.'', No. 28,613-III (Cocke County Cir. Court of Tenn. 2003).</ref>  Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto III'', Thompson sought $246 million in damages from the publisher, [[Take-Two Interactive]], along with [[PlayStation 2]] maker [[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] and retailer [[Wal-Mart]].

Thompson was involved in another similar suit in [[Alabama]] in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by [[Devin Moore (murderer)|Devin Moore]], a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive ''Grand Theft Auto'' player. However, his participation in the case ran into a dispute over his ''[[pro hac vice]]'' admission to practice law in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of this privilege by arguing that his conduct was unethical and claiming he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails.<ref name="DeWitt1">DeWitt, Robert.

In the aftermath of this lawsuit, Thompson lobbied [[Alabama attorney general]] [[Troy King]] to file a civil suit and call on retailers not to sell "cop-killing games."<ref name="Linn"/> After the slaying of another police officer in [[Gassville, Arkansas]] by [[Jacob D.

Thompson once reported that he had videotaped a Miami [[Best Buy]] selling a copy of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' to his son who was 10 at the time.

In January 2005, Best Buy agreed that it would enforce an existing policy to check the identification of anyone who appeared to be 17 or under and tried to purchase games rated "M" (for mature audiences).<ref name="Baldas">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1105364082606|title=Video Game Industry Explodes With Legal, Regulatory Issues|accessdate=|last=Baldas|first=Tresa|date=2005-01-11|work=[[The National Law Journal]]|publisher= Law.com}}</ref> No law in effect at the time prohibited selling "M" rated video games to juveniles.

In September 2006, Thompson filed a suit in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] against Sony, Take-Two, Rockstar Games, and [[Cody Posey]], for the wrongful death of three members of Posey's family. The 69-page complaint filed by Thompson and Albuquerque attorney [[Steven Sanders (attorney)|Steven Sanders]] argued that "obsessively" playing ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'' made violence "pleasurable and attractive," disconnected violence from consequences, and caused Posey to "act out, copycat, replicate and emulate the violence" when he shot and killed his father, stepmother, and stepsister, and then buried them under a manure pile at a ranch owned by former [[ABC News]] reporter [[Sam Donaldson]] in July, 2004. Thompson and Sanders filed the lawsuit on behalf of the surviving family members of Posey's father. According to Thompson, "Posey essentially practiced how to kill on this game.

On March 14, 2007 Take-Two [[Take-Two Interactive v. John B. Thompson|filed a lawsuit]] to prevent Thompson from preventing the sale of ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' and ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' to minors, claiming that Thompson's effort to block sales of its games through lawsuits violates the company's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.<ref name="Ganapati">Ganapati, Priya.

===''Bully''===

Beginning in 2005, Thompson supported a campaign to discourage Take-Two<U+2019>s subsidiary, [[Rockstar Games]], from releasing a game called ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]'', in which, according to Thompson, "what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those whom you have been victimized by. And then you, like [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Klebold and Harris]] in Columbine, become the ultimate bully."<ref name="Dobbs">Dobbs, Lou. ''Lou Dobbs Tonight''. CNN, 2005-08-24.</ref> According to Thompson, the game "shows you how to&nbsp;<U+2014> by bullying&nbsp;<U+2014> take over your school.

Thompson also criticized [[Bill Gates]] and [[Microsoft]] for contracting with Rockstar Games to release the game on the [[Xbox]].<ref name=Tribune/> The Xbox version has since been canceled for undisclosed reasons, but a version was released on the [[Xbox 360]]. In August 2006, Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy, threatening to file suit in Miami if he did not gain help from U.S. Rep. [[Cliff Stearns]]. Once the game is out, according to Thompson, "the horse will be out of the barn and it will be too late to do anything about it." Thompson  argued that it violated Florida's [[public nuisance]] laws, which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community.<ref name="TechWeb">Jones, K.C.

Thompson was critical of the judge's decision, telling the judge "You did not see the game... You don't even know what it was you saw," as well as accusing the Take-Two employee who demonstrated the game of avoiding the most violent parts.<ref name="careyBridget">Carey, Bridget.

Thompson later drew attention to the game's main character, a 15-year old male, being able to kiss other boys. Thompson wrote to [[ESRB]] president Patricia Vance, "We just found gay sexual content in ''Bully'' as [[List of characters in Bully|Jimmy Hopkins]] makes out with another male student. Good luck with your Teen rating now." The ESRB indicated that they knew the content was in the game when they rated the game.<ref name="gameroundup">"[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-11-03-news-bytes_x.htm Game roundup: Wait for 'Burning Crusade'; 'Mansfield' a 96-hour keeper]." ''USA Today'', 2006-11-03.</ref>

===''Mortal Kombat''===

In October 2006, Thompson sent a letter to [[Midway Games]], demanding they [[cease and desist]] selling the latest game in the ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' series, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'', claiming that the game was illegally profiting on his likeness, because gamers could use the [[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon#Create a Fighter|Create a Fighter]] option to make a character who looked like Jack Thompson.<ref name="gameroundup" /> Midway did not respond to his letter.

===Activism and lobbying===

In addition to filing lawsuits, Thompson has pushed for measures against similar games in a variety of public settings. He wrote a joint article in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' with [[Eugene F. Provenzo]], a University of Miami professor who studies the effects of video games on children. Originally brought together to provide opposing viewpoints on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]], they said they had become friends and were collaborating on a book. They described themselves as having "a shared belief that first-person shooter video games are bad for our children, teaching them to act aggressively and providing them with efficient killing skills and romanticized and trivialized scenarios for killing in the real world".<ref name="Provenzo">Provenzo, Eugene F., Jr. and Jack Thompson. "[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1019/p09s01-coop.html A political odd couple's advice on finding common ground]." ''Christian Science Monitor'', 2004-10-19.</ref>

Thompson has supported legislation in a number of states that would ban sales of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors.<ref name="Baldas" /> In response to [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] concerns, he argued that the games were a "public safety hazard."<ref name="Snyder">Snyder, David. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/805019011.html?FMT=ABS Md. House Panel Hesitant on Video Game Restrictions]". ''Washington Post'', March 9, 2005.</ref> However, he rejected as "completely unconstitutional" [[Hillary Clinton]]'s proposed legislation to ban sales to minors of games rated "M" for Mature by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]. Thompson contended that the government could not enforce a private-sector standard but had to depend on a [[Miller test|''Miller'' obscenity test]]. He charged that Clinton was simply positioning herself politically, with the support of the gaming industry, by proposing a bill which he felt she knew would be unconstitutional.<ref name="Star-Telegram">Thompson, Jack. "What kind of game is Hillary Clinton playing?" ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'', 2005-12-11.</ref>

In July 2005, Thompson sent a letter to several politicians urging them to investigate ''[[The Sims 2]]'', alleging that the game contained nudity accessible by entering special codes. Thompson called the nudity inappropriate for a game rated "T" for Teen, a rating which indicates suitability for anyone 13 and older. Manufacturer [[Electronic Arts]] dismissed the allegations, with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have "no anatomical detail" under their clothes, effectively resembling [[Barbie]] dolls. Although the game does display blurred-out patches over body regions when characters are naked, such as when taking a shower, Brown said that was for "humorous effect" and denied there was anything improper about the game.<ref name="Wingfield">Wingfield, Nick. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/872507961.html?FMT=ABS Guess What's Hiding in Your Videogame]." ''The Wall Street Journal'', 2005-07-26.</ref> Nevertheless, a command that could be entered into the [[Console (video game CLI)|in-game console]] in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion. No official reason was given for the change.

In [[Louisiana]], Thompson helped draft a 2006 bill sponsored by state representative [[Roy Burrell]] to ban the sale of violent video games to buyers under 18 ([[Louisiana House Bill 1381|HB1381]]). In an effort to avoid constitutional problems, it avoided trying to define "violent" and instead adopted a variation of the [[Miller test|''Miller'' obscenity test]]: sales to minors would be illegal based on community standards if the game appealed to "the minor's morbid interest in violence", was patently offensive based on adult standards of suitability for minors, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. The bill was passed unanimously by the state House and approved by the Senate Judiciary A Committee, despite industry opposition and predictions that it too would be unconstitutional.<ref name="Hasten">Hasten, Mike. "[http://web.archive.org/web/20060722004113/http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060531/NEWS01/305310004/1002/NEWS Video game sales ban advances to La. Senate]".

''KATC3'', April 16, 2007.</ref>

At one point, Thompson was asked by the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] to stop invoking the organization's name in his campaigns. NIMF president David Walsh felt Thompson cast the organization in a bad light whenever he brought up their name. "Your commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your tactics have included personally attacking individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect," Walsh said in an open letter to Thompson.<ref name="Tilley2">Tilley, Steve. "Spielberg Grabs the Controller." ''Toronto Sun'', 2005-10-23.</ref>

Thompson has additionally worked to influence police investigations concerning violent acts which he views as being connected to violence in video games media. On June 2, 2006, Thompson suggested that [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]] police detectives, investigating the murder of 55-year-old Michael Gore by 17-year-old Kurt Edward Neher, should look into the video games played by Neher. According to Sheriff J. Austin Daniel, an autopsy showed Gore was beaten to death as well as shot in the face. Concerning this, Thompson stated that "nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hit man or a video gamer."<ref name="Minton">{{cite web|last=Minton|first=James|date=2006-06-03|url= http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/police/2924321.html|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060617221000/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/police/2924321.html|archivedate= 2006-06-17|title=Video games seized from teen<U+2019>s home|publisher=The Advocate| accessdate=2006-06-03}}</ref>

Thompson has also criticized a Christian video game based on the ''[[Left Behind]]'' series. In ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]'', players participate in "battles raging in the streets of New York," according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values.<ref name="SiouxCity">Rhodes, Hillary.

In April 2007, only hours after the Virginia Tech shooting (and before [[Seung-Hui Cho]] was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game ''[[Counter-Strike]]''.<ref name="Benedetti">Benedetti, Winda. "[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18220228/ Were video games to blame for massacre?]"  ''MSNBC.com'', 2007-04-20</ref> According to Thompson, the game "drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [and] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower." He says that Seung-Hui "was in a [[hyper-reality]] situation in [[virtual reality]]." Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played ''Counter-Strike'' in [[high school]], four years prior to the shooting, Thompson asserts that "you don't drop it when you go to college, typically." Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people."<ref name="VTHardball">''Hardball'', MSNBC, 2007-04-19</ref> Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the "[[flat affect|flat effect]]{{sic}} on [Seung-Hui's] face" and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting.<ref name="VTMSNBC">MSNBC, 2007-04-16, 7:27 PM.</ref>  However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a ''[[Washington Post]]'' story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played ''Counter-Strike'' in years, Thompson continued to insist that "this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the [[The Terminator|Terminator]], he's a video gamer." Thompson also sent a letter to [[Bill Gates]], saying, "Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that used to be in the Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." However, Microsoft did not create ''Counter-Strike'' - they only published the [[Xbox]] version of the game.<ref name="Benedetti" /> The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui "played video games like ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''," and that "none of the video games [he had played] were war games or had violent themes."<ref name="VTReport">Virginia Tech Incident Review Panel.

In December 2007, Thompson filed suit against [[Omaha, Nebraska]] [[Omaha Police Department|Police Chief]] [[Thomas Warren]], asking him to produce information on all "violent entertainment material" belonging to Robert Hawkins, who killed nine people, including himself, in a  [[Westroads Mall shooting|shooting]] at the [[Westroads Mall]] earlier that month. According to Omaha police, such information is not a matter of [[public record]], as it is part of an ongoing criminal investigation.<ref name="OmahaShooting">"[http://www.ketv.com/news/14942590/detail.html Lawyer Sues OPD Chief For Hawkins' Video-Game Records]."

On February 15, 2008, Jack Thompson claimed that the actions of [[Steven Kazmierczak]], who  the previous day [[Northern Illinois University shooting|killed five people]] at [[Northern Illinois University]] before committing suicide, were influenced by the game ''Counter-Strike''.<ref>''FOX News Channel'', 2008-02-15.</ref> In a subsequent news release, Thompson claimed that "We have a nation of [[Manchurian Candidate]] video gamers out there who are ready, willing, and able to massacre, and some of them will."<ref name="Benedetti2">Benedetti, Windi.

===Relationship with the gaming industry and gamers===
{{seealso|A Modest Video Game Proposal}}

Thompson's "high-profile crusades" have made him an enemy of video game aficionados.<ref name="Krueger" /> On occasion, Thompson has sparred directly with the gaming industry and its fans. In 2005, he wrote an open letter to [[Entertainment Software Association]] president [[Doug Lowenstein]], making what he described as a "a modest video game proposal" (an allusion to the title of [[Jonathan Swift]]'s [[satire|satirical]] essay, ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'') to the video game industry: Thompson said he would donate $10,000 to a charity designated by Take-Two CEO [[Paul Eibeler]] if any video game company would create a game including the scenario he described in the letter. The scenario called for the main character, whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games, to murder a number of industry executives (including one modeled on Eibeler) and go on a killing spree at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]]. Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer, resulting in the game ''[[I'm O.K - A Murder Simulator]]'', among others. Afterwards, he claimed that his proposal was [[satire]], and refused to make the promised donation.

In response, [[Jerry Holkins]] and [[Mike Krahulik]], the creators of gaming [[webcomic]] ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' and of the children's charity [[Child's Play (charity)|Child's Play]], stepped in to make the $10,000 donation instead, writing in the memo field of their cheque, "For Jack Thompson, Because Jack Thompson Won't." Afterwards, Thompson tried unsuccessfully to get Seattle police and the FBI to investigate Holkins and Krahulik for orchestrating "criminal harassment" of him through articles on their site.<ref name="Kohler">Kohler, Chris.

In 2006, two [[Michigan]] gamers began a project dubbed "Flowers for Jack", soliciting donations to deliver a massive floral arrangement to Thompson<U+2019>s office.  The flowers were delivered in February along with a letter aimed at opening a dialogue between Thompson and the video gaming community. Thompson rejected this overture and forwarded the flowers to some of his industry foes, with such comments as "Discard them along with the decency you discarded long ago. I really don't care. Grind them up and smoke them if you like."<ref name="Tilley">Tilley, Steve. "New Windows Will Be Open to Halo 2." ''Toronto Sun'', 2006-02-12.</ref>

Gamers have responded to Thompson's attempt to link the Virginia Tech massacre to the game ''Counter-Strike''. Video game Web sites and young gamers on Internet message boards "teemed with anger" at what ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reporter [[Peter Hartlaub]] called "his serial misstatements," in some cases linking to [[YouTube]] videos of Thompson and dissecting his claims point by point.<ref name="Hartlaub">Hartlaub, Peter.  "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/04/24/DDG4PPCNHL1.DTL Another tragedy, another platform for video game fearmonger]".  ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 2007-04-24</ref> [[Jason Della Rocca]], executive director of the [[International Game Developers Association]], said, "It's so sad. These massacre chasers<U+2014>they're worse than [[ambulance chaser]]s<U+2014>they're waiting for these things to happen so they can jump on their soapbox."<ref name="Benedetti" /> In response, Thompson referred to Della Rocca as an "idiot" and a "jackass [...] paid not to connect the dots [connecting shootings to video games]," and compared himself to people who warned that the government should be more concerned about terrorism before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref name="VTMSNBC2">MSNBC, 2007-04-21, 8:42 AM.</ref>  According to Della Rocca, Thompson then challenged him to a series of gaming debates, claiming that they could each make more than $3,000 per event. When Della Rocca suggested that neither he nor Thompson accept any money for the events, Thompson refused.<ref name="Benedetti2" />

In July 2009, [[Entertainment Consumers Association]] (ECA) president [[Hal Halpin]] posted a copy of an [http://forums.theeca.com/showthread.php?t=6357 email exchange] between himself and Thompson, stating, <U+201C>I get messages (IMs, emails, FB notes, etc.) from members all the time, asking what the (almost daily) notes are from JT. Since this one's fairly harmless and I've redacted anything personal (not that I don't love getting his threatening cease and desist letters), I thought I'd share it as a pretty typical exchange.<U+201D> Halpin and Thompson have been vocal opponents since 1998, when Halpin ran the game retail trade association IEMA. The exchange was sparked by a guest editorial that Halpin did entitled, <U+201C>Perception is Everything<U+201D> for IndustryGamers.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/perception-is-everything/ |title=Perception is Everything - IndustryGamers |publisher=IndustryGamers<! |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref> where he called for consumers and the industry to speak out against negative stereotyping of gamers.

In March 2011, in response to the creation of a school shooter mod entitled ''School Shooter: North American Tour 2012'', developed by Checkerboarded Studios on [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[Source engine]], Thompson emailed Valve's managing director, [[Gabe Newell]], demanding that the mod be removed, as he speculated that Valve played a part in the mod's development.<ref name=TheEscapist>{{cite news|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108523-Jack-Thompson-Threatens-Gabe-Newell-Over-School-Shooter-Mod|title=Jack Thompson Threatens Gabe Newell Over School Shooter Mod|date=2011-03-17|accessdate=2011-04-10|last=Chalk|first=Andy|publisher=[[The Escapist]]}}</ref> In the letter, Thompson stated that ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' was directly responsible for the [[Erfurt massacre]], as well as the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] and that Valve had until 5:00 [[PM]] on March 18 to remove the mod.<ref name=TheEscapist/>

==The Howard Stern Show==

In 2004, Thompson helped get [[Howard Stern]]'s show taken off a radio station in [[Orlando, Florida]] by filing a complaint with the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. Thompson objected to Stern<U+2019>s use of perceived obscenities on the air. He argued that "Either broadcasters will accept the light harness of decency that has been the law for decades and start cleaning up their acts, or the public's deepening outrage will foster a more fearsome governmental response."<ref name="WhyIComplain">Thompson, Jack. "Why I Complain About Indecency." ''Broadcasting & Cable'', 2004-04-26.</ref>  Thompson claimed to have received death threats from listeners of Stern's show, noting that "you'd expect that considering the [[IQ]] of people who listen to Howard Stern. Apparently they fail to realize that I might have [[caller ID]]."<ref name="Mayo">Mayo, Michael.  "Puritanical Intolerance is Scarier Than Stern Himself." ''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'', 2004-04-18.</ref>

During his opposition to Howard Stern, Thompson was asked in an interview with a reporter if, by his standards, he would blame [[Christianity]] for the murders committed by [[List of school-related attacks#Secondary school incidents|Michael Hernandez]], a fourteen year old who murdered one of his classmates in 2004, because Hernandez wrote a diary in which he constantly spoke about praying to God. Thompson replied, "The Bible doesn't promote killing innocent people, ''Grand Theft Auto'' does.  [[Islam]] does." Thompson then expanded his comments in the same interview by saying, "Islam promotes the killing of innocent people. The [[Qur'an|Quran]] requires the infidel, whether Jew or Christian, to be killed. ... That's a core essence of the religion. ... [[Muhammad]] was a pirate who killed infidels and who advocated the killing of infidels&nbsp;<U+2014> not a nice guy. [[Osama bin Laden]] is in keeping with his fine tradition."<ref name="Mayo" />

He later spoke in defense of Stern during the latter<U+2019>s legal dispute with [[CBS]] over promoting [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] on-air before his switch to satellite radio. Thompson contended that the technology added by CBS to edit out profanity also could have worked to edit out Stern's references to Sirius.<ref name="Arango">Arango, Tim. "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/996225561.html?FMT=ABS Decency crusader backs up Howard]." ''New York Post'', March 2, 2006.</ref> According to Thompson, "The reason why CBS chose not to edit Stern is that Stern's Arbitron ratings remained high and were arguably even enhanced by people tuning in to hear daily about Stern's running feud with CBS and his move to Sirius. In other words, CBS actually used Stern's discussion of his move to Sirius to make more money for CBS."<ref name="Rosenthal">Rosenthal, Phil. "The Chicago Tribune Phil Rosenthal Media column." ''Knight Ridder Tribune Business News'', March 3, 2006.</ref>

CBS President [[Leslie Moonves]] responded, saying "You know what? You can<U+2019>t let people like that tell you what to put on the air or what not to put on the air. That would only open the door when suddenly next week, he says, 'Take [[The Late Show with David Letterman|David Letterman]] off the air or take ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|C.S.I.]]'' off the air.' Or you know what? ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' was about, you know, sex last week or about a 70-year-old man<U+2014>you know, we dealt with [[Peter Boyle]] having sex with [[Doris Roberts]].

''Topic A with Tina Brown'' CNBC, 2004-11-21.</ref>

==The Florida Bar==
=== Actions against the bar===

In 1993, Thompson asked a Florida judge to declare [[The Florida Bar]] unconstitutional. He said that the Bar was engaged in a vendetta against him because of his religious beliefs, which he said conflicted with what he called the Bar's pro-gay, [[humanism|humanist]], liberal agenda. He also said that the "wedding of all three functions of government into The Florida Bar, the 'official arm' of the [[Florida Supreme Court]], is violative of the bedrock constitutional requirement of the separation powers and the 'checks and balances' which the separation guarantees."<ref name="TheRecorder">Miami Review. "Suit Attacks Constitutionality of Bar." ''The Recorder'', 1992-06-11.</ref> Thompson accepted a $20,000 out-of-court settlement.<ref name="Settlement">"In Brief: Lawyer Accepts $20,000 Bar Settlement." ''Miami Herald'', February 5, 1993.</ref>

On January 7, 2002, Thompson sent the Supreme Court of Florida a letter regarding The Florida Bar's actions. The letter was filed with the court on January 10, 2002 and was treated as a [[petition]] for a [[writ of mandamus]] against The Florida Bar.<ref name="JTwritlet">''Thompson v. The Florida Bar'', No. SC02-82 (Fla. 2002).</ref> Before any action was taken on the petition, Thompson sent the court another letter on January 28, 2002 voluntarily dismissing the case. The letter was filed with the court on January 30, 2002, and the Florida Supreme Court issued an order of dismissal on February 28, 2002.<ref name="FSCorderdis">''Thompson v. The Florida Bar'', 816 So.2d 130 (Fla. 2002) (decided without opinion).</ref>

In January 2006, Thompson asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to investigate The Florida Bar's actions. "The Florida Bar and its agents have engaged in a documented pattern of this illegal activity, which may sink to the level of criminal racketeering activity, in a knowing and illegal effort to chill my federal First Amendment rights," Thompson wrote in a letter to [[Alex Acosta]], interim [[U.S. attorney]] for the Southern District of Florida.<ref name="CarlJones">Jones, Carl. "[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1144933474083 Anti-porn crusader sues over Bar probe]." ''Broward Daily Business Review'', 2006-04-13.</ref>

In April 2006, Thompson filed another suit against The Florida Bar, this time in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida]], alleging that the Bar harassed him by investigating what he called baseless complaints made by disgruntled opponents in previous disputes. His five-count complaint asked for more than $1 million in damages. The lawsuit alleged that the Bar was pursuing baseless ethics complaints brought against Thompson by [[Tew Cardenas]] attorneys [[Lawrence Kellogg]] and [[Alberto "Al" Cardenas|Alberto Cardenas]] of Miami, and by two lawyers from the [[Philadelphia]] office of [[Blank Rome]], in violation of Thompson's constitutional rights. According to the lawsuit, the Bar looked at Thompson for violations of a bar rule that prohibits attorneys from making disparaging remarks about judges, other attorneys, or court personnel. Thompson also filed a motion with the court to order the mediation of his dispute with the Bar. Thompson commented, "I enjoy doing what I do and I think I've got a First Amendment right to annoy people and participate in the public square in the cultural war." Thompson also said he is optimistic his federal lawsuit will be successful. "I'm 100 percent certain that it will effect change, otherwise I would not have filed it."<ref name="CarlJones" />

On April 25, 2006, The Florida Bar filed a motion to dismiss Thompson's complaint. The Bar argued that Thompson's complaint should be dismissed for a number of reasons, including the fact that the complaint failed to state a claim on which he could be granted relief. The Bar also argued that it was absolutely immune from liability for actions arising out of its disciplinary functions, that the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] barred Thompson's recovery of damages, and that the court should dismiss the case pursuant to the [[abstention doctrine]] of ''[[Younger v. Harris]]''. On May 4, 2006, Thompson filed a motion asking Judge Frederico Moreno to recuse himself from the case, as Judge Moreno was a member of the Florida Bar. Citing an "abundance of caution," Judge Moreno recused himself on May 9, 2006 and referred the case to Chief Judge William Zloch for further action. Thompson did not, however, respond to the Bar's motion to dismiss the case. Finally, on May 17, 2006, Thompson filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal with the court, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.<ref name="FlaBar2006">''Thompson v. The Florida Bar'', No. CV-06-20945 (S.D. Fla. May 17, 2006).</ref>

===Filings===

In October 2007, Chief U.S. District Judge [[Federico Moreno]] [[Record sealing|sealed]] court documents submitted by Thompson in the Bar case that depicted "gay sex acts." Thompson's submission prompted U.S. District Judge [[Adalberto Jordan]] on to order Thompson to [[Order to show cause|show cause]] why his actions should not be filed as a grievance with the court's Ad Hoc Committee on Attorney Admissions, Peer Review and Attorney Grievance, but the order was dismissed after Thompson promised not to file any more pornography. Thompson then sent letters to acting U.S. Attorney General [[Peter Keisler]] and U.S. Senators [[Patrick Leahy]] and [[Arlen Specter]] demanding that Jordan be removed from his position for failing to prosecute Florida attorney [[Norm Kent]], who Thompson claimed had "collaborated" with the Bar for 20 years to discipline him.<ref name="PornographyFiling">Roberts, Alana.

''Daily Business Review'', 2007-10-22.</ref>

In February 2008, the [[Florida Supreme Court]] ordered Thompson to show cause as to why it should not reject future court filings from him unless they are signed by another Florida Bar member. The Florida Supreme Court described his filings as "repetitive, frivolous and insult[ing to] the integrity of the court," particularly one in which Thompson, claiming concern about "the court's inability to comprehend his arguments," filed a motion which he called "A picture book for adults", including images of "[[swastikas]], [[Kangaroo Court|kangaroos in court]], a reproduced dollar bill, cartoon [[squirrels]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Ray Charles]], a handprint with the word [[SLAPP|'slap']] written under it, Bar Governor [[Benedict P. Kuehne]], a [[baby]], [[Ed Bradley]], [[Jack Nicholson]], Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[monkeys]], [and] a [[house of cards]]." (see <ref>http://www.gamepolitics.com/images/legal/JT-picture-letter.doc</ref>) Thompson claimed that the order "wildly infringes" on his constitutional rights and was "a brazen attempt" to repeal the First Amendment right to petition the government to redress grievances. In response, he sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General [[Michael Mukasey]], referring to the show-cause order as a criminal act done in retaliation for his seeking relief with the court.<ref name="ShowCause">Roberts, Alana. "[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1203602190910 Anti-Porn Crusader May Face Sanctions for 'Meritless Filings.']" ''Daily Business Review'', 2008-02-22.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2185966/ |title=The weirdest legal pleading ever. - By Bonnie Goldstein - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref>

On March 20, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court imposed sanctions on Thompson, requiring that any of his future filings in the court be signed by a member of The Florida Bar other than himself. The court noted that Thompson had responded to the show cause order with multiple "rambling, argumentative, and contemptuous" responses that characterized the show cause order as "bizarre" and "idiotic."<ref name="floridasupremecourt.org"/>

===Disbarment proceedings===
{{wikinews|Controversial Florida attorney Jack Thompson disbarred}}

In February 2007, The Florida Bar filed [[disbarment]] proceedings against Thompson over allegations of professional misconduct. The action was the result of separate grievances filed by people claiming that Thompson made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass or intimidate them.<ref name="Disbarment">Jones, K.C. "[http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197003885 Grand Theft Auto Critic Faces Misconduct Charges]." ''InformationWeek'', 2007-02-06.</ref> According to the complaint, Thompson accused Alberto Cardenas of "distribution of pornography to children," claimed that the Alabama judge presiding over the [[Devin Moore (murderer)|Devin Moore]] case "breaks the rules, even the Alabama State Bar Rules, because he thinks that the rules don't apply to him," and sent a letter to Blank Rome's  managing partner, saying, "Your law firm has actively and knowingly facilitated by various means the criminal distribution of sexual material to minors."  Thompson claims that the complaints violate state religious protections because his advocacy is motivated by his Christian faith.<ref>Ostrovsky, Daniel.  "[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1170928966137 Fla. Bar Seeks Sanctions Against Morality Watchdog Jack Thompson.]" ''Daily Business Review'',  2007-02-09.</ref>

In May 2008, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Dava Tunis, after reviewing 2,400 pages of transcripts and 1,700 pages of exhibits, recommended that Thompson be found guilty of 27 of the 31 violations of which he had been accused, including making false statements to tribunals, disparaging and humiliating litigants and other lawyers, and improperly practicing law outside of Florida. Thompson filed a motion with the Florida Supreme Court the day after the report was issued to strike Tunis' recommendations as vague for lack of detail. Previously, Thompson had attempted to have Tunis thrown off his case, and filed a complaint against her with the state Judicial Qualifications Commission, which is responsible for investigating judges.<ref>Roberts, Alana.  "[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202421556225 Sanctions Hearing Set for Lawyer Found to Have Humiliated Litigants, Other Attorneys.]" ''Daily Business Review'',  2008-05-21.</ref>

On June 4, 2008, prosecutor Sheila Tuma recommended 'enhanced disbarment' for Thompson, saying that Thompson demonstrated continued misconduct, a pattern of misconduct and persistently failed to admit any wrongdoing. Enhanced disbarment lengthens the period before an attorney may reapply for admission to the bar from five years to ten. After being prevented from making a speech to begin the disciplinary hearing, Thompson distributed his written objections to lawyers, a court reporter, and a newspaper reporter,  departed the courtroom, and called the proceedings against him a "[[Star Chamber|star chamber]]" and "[[kangaroo court]]."<ref>Roberts, Alana and Shields, Billy.  "[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202421944039 Enhanced Disbarment Recommended due to Lawyer's Pattern of Conduct.]" ''Daily Business Review'',  2008-06-05.</ref>

On July 8, 2008, Judge Tunis recommended permanent disbarment and a $43,675.35 fine for Thompson to the Florida Supreme Court, citing "cumulative misconduct, a repeated pattern of behavior relentlessly forced upon numerous unconnected individuals, a total lack of remorse or even slight acknowledgment of inappropriate conduct, and continued behavior consistent with the previous public reprimand...Over a very extended period of time involving a number of totally unrelated cases and individuals, the Respondent has demonstrated a pattern of conduct to strike out harshly, extensively, repeatedly and willfully to simply try to bring as much difficulty, distraction and anguish to those he considers in opposition to his causes...He does not proceed within the guidelines of appropriate professional behavior, but rather uses other means available to intimidate, harass, or bring public disrepute to those whom he perceives oppose him.".<ref name=refrpt>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridabar.org/DIVADM/ME/MPDisAct.nsf/DISACTVIEW/126614A251FD090B852574D100067A8D/$FILE/231665_8.PDF |title=Report of Referee, '&#39;The Florida Bar v.

===Facebook lawsuit===
<!-- PLEASE NOTE BEFORE EDITING THIS SECTION: Thompson's disbarment prevents him from acting as an attorney for others, it does not prevent him from filing a civil lawsuit and therefore need not be re-iterated here. See talk page and archives for discussion. -->

Thompson filed a law suit for $40 million against [[Facebook]] in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on September 29, 2009. Thompson claimed that the social networking site had caused him ''great harm and distress'' by not removing angry postings made by users in several Facebook groups.  According to [[Parry Aftab]], a cyber-law attorney, Thompson is not likely to have any success as per the U.S. [[Communications Decency Act]] which states that companies like Facebook have no liability for what users do with their services in most cases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jack Thompson Sues Facebook Over Video-Game Backlash |first=Chloe |last=Albanesius |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2353659,00.asp |magazine=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodgearguide.com.au/article/320607 |title=Jack Thompson sues Facebook for $40M - Facebook, games - Good Gear Guide |publisher=Good Gear Guide<! |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref>
