'''First Fruits''' are a religious offering of the first agricultural produce of the harvest. In classical [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Judaism|Hebrew]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] religions, the first fruits were offered to the [[temple]] or [[church]]. First Fruits were often a primary source of income to maintain the religious leaders and the facility. 

==In Ancient Greece==
In Classical [[Athens]] the First Fruits were called an offering of ''aparche''. Except during times of war, this would be a major source of funds for the temples of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinian]] goddesses, [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]] (pronounced kore-eh). Much of the agricultural offering was sold by the temple with the proceeds to pay for the daily upkeep of the temple complex. Under [[Pericles]]' rule, it became a way of extending Athens' power. The [[Demos]] or voting citizens would control the operation of the temple by elected boards. During times of war or for other needs the Demos would borrow money from the treasury of the temple. Neighboring cities under Athens' control were required to give offerings from their harvests. This served to enrich Athens and extend her power.   

Much of this was shown in the temple reports which were carved in stone when the governing body (called the ''epistatai'') of the temple changed hands. In the stone IG I<sup>3</sup> 386-387 it can been seen how the finances of the Eleusinian temples worked. Doctor [[List of Swarthmore College people|Maureen B. Cavanaugh]] who translated stone IG I<sup>3</sup> 386-387, argues that there were heavy implications of the funding realized from the First Fruits donations to the temple, in particular that it brought significant impact on Athenian power.<ref>Maureen B. Cavanaugh [PhD],''[[Eleusis]] and Athens - Documents in Finance, Religion and Politics in the Fifth Century B.C. '', Scholars Press, Published 1996, ISBN 0-7885-0031-7. </ref> This is noted in a loan sited in the stone record, of over 20,000 silver [[drachma]]s to the city. The Eleusinian temple complex was more than just a temple to Demeter; there were living quarters, storage, work shops, administration as well as public spaces. It was almost like a city within a city.

==In Ancient Rome==
In the Roman religion the first fruits offering was observed in the Roman home. This was done during daily meals as well as more formal religious times of the month. 

==Biblical==
===In Ancient Israel===
In the [[Ancient Israel]], First Fruits were [[tithe]]d as [[heave offerings|Heave Offerings]]; the tithe was allocated throughout the year, but for accounting purposes traditionally began each year at [[Tu Bishvat]], which was thus the occasion of a festival. In later times<ref name="peake">''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref> this tithe was limited to [[Seven Species|the traditional seven agricultural products]] ([[Wheat]], [[Barley]], [[Grapes]] in the form of [[Wine]], [[Figs]], [[Pomegranates]], [[Olives]] in the form of [[Oil]], and [[Date Palm|Dates]]) grown in [[Palestine]], but eventually [[onion]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[melon]]s, a traditional [[cheese]] (known as ''tiltan''), the [[herb]] [[fenugreek]], and certain other vegetables were permitted as well.<ref name="jewenc_heave">''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Heave offerings''</ref> This tithe, and the associated harvest festival, is legislated by the [[Torah]],<ref>[[Exodus]] 23:16; [[Deuteronomy]] 26:2; Exodus 23:19; [[Leviticus]] 23:9; et al.</ref> though [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] believe that these regulations [[documentary hypothesis|were imposed long after]] the offerings and festival had developed.<ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''</ref> 

By the time of [[classical antiquity]] more extensive regulations had developed, and were subsequently recorded in the [[Classical Rabbinical Literature]].<ref name="peake" /> According to the these, the corners of fields, wild areas, left overs after harvesting (''gleanings''), and unowned crops were not subjected to (and could not be used as) the tithe of First Fruits ([[Tzedakah|they were intended to be left as charity]] for [[pauper|the poor]], and other [[mendicant]]s);<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> plants from outside Palestine were also prohibited from inclusion in the tithe,<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> as was anything belonging to non-Jews.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Sacrifice''</ref> The rules also specify that that each type of product had to be individually tithed, even if the numbers were balanced so that there was no difference in amount between this situation and using just some types of First Fruit as the tithe, and retaining others in their entirety.<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> Fruit which was allocated to the tithe could not be swapped for fruit which wasn't, to the extent that wine couldn't be swapped for vinegar, and olive oil couldn't be replaced by olives; furthermore, Fruits were not allowed to be individually divided if only part went to the tithe (small whole onions had to be used rather than fractions of large onions, for example).<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> 

The separation of tithed produce from untithed produce was also subject to regulatation. The individual(s) separating one from the other had to be [[ritual cleanliness|ritually clean]], and had to include the best produce in the tithe if [[kohen|a priest]] lived nearby.<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> During the act of separation, the produce was not permitted to be counted out to determine which fell under the tithe, nor to be weighed for that purpose, nor to be measured for the same reason, but instead the proportion that was to become the tithe had to be guessed at.<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> In certain situations, such as when tithed produce became mixed with non-tithed produce (or there was uncertainty as to whether it had), the tithed produce had to be destroyed.<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> Anyone who made mistakes in the separation of tithed produce, and anyone who consumed any of the tithe, was required to pay compensation as a ''[[guilt offering]]''.<ref name="jewenc_heave" /> 

===Christian perspectives===
Although some [[Christianity|Christian]] [[harvest festival|churches do celebrate harvest time]], the idea of giving the First Fruits to the church has been otherwise abandoned by Christianity. In the [[Biblical Canon|Canonical]] [[Gospels]], the concept of the harvest of First Fruits is used [[metaphor]]ically and [[allegory|allegorically]]. In the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Jesus]] is described as stating that ''in the time of harvest'' he would instruct the harvesters to gather the ''tares'', bind them into bundles, and burn them, but to gather the ''wheat'' in ''[his] barn''. Some Christian pundits argue that this is more about saving man than offering any thanksgiving to a deity, the ''tares'' being sinners and the ''wheat'' being the chosen or good people, though other Christian pundits, as well as early [[gnosticism|gnostic]] writers argued it was less about sin and more about following his teachings and abandoning the teachings they had formerly known.  In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus is described as stating ''... he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together'',<ref>John 4:36</ref> which some Christian pundits argue is about rewards from God for those who perform God<U+2019>s work.

Tithe literally means a tenth.  First Fruits means to appropriatley mark as a male.  Which according to God's word the first male born of each womb belongs to the Lord.  This is completely different from tithing.

==In the Roman Catholic Church==
{{main|Annates}}
In the [[Middle Ages]] the concept of offering the first fruits was adapted by the Christian church.  This was called a [[tithe]] and was basically a tax to support the local clergy and the facility.  In [[England]], every tenth [[Egg (food)|egg]], sheaf of [[wheat]], [[lamb]], [[chicken]], and all other animals were given to the church as a tithe, so farm products were expected to be donated throughout the year.

In [[France]], the tithes<U+2014>called "la d<U+00EE>me"<U+2014>were a land and agricultural tax. The offering of first fruits was also referred to as new fruits.  In French churches in the Middle Ages, new fruits were at given seasons presented at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] for blessing.  The blessed fruits were kept by the church and divided between the clergy and the poor.  Similar customs during the Middle Ages could be found in all European countries.

First Fruits also refers to the payment new clerics made to the [[bishop]] or the [[Pope]] of all profits from the territory the new cleric controlled.  This payment was called both Annates and First Fruits.
