'''Alice Springs''' is a town in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]]. 
Alice Springs (23.8S, 133.89E) has a population of 26,486 (in 2005<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/ Australian 

Bureau of Statistics] Retrieved on [[25 September]] 
[[2006]]</ref> ). The town is 576 metres above sea level in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia. It is the second 
largest centre in the Northern Territory and is popularly known as "the Alice" or simply "Alice.<U+201D> The town is 200 km 
south of the absolute centre of Australia and nearly equidistant from Adelaide and Darwin, 
Alice Springs is known as Mparntwe to its [[Indigenous Australians|traditional]] inhabitants, the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]], who have lived in the Central Australian desert in and around Alice Springs for more than 50,000 
years. 

Alice Springs is best-known outside the region from the title of the [[Nevil Shute]] novel ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'', 
even though little of the story takes place in Alice Springs, and because of its proximity to [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), 
the monolithic rock that is one of Australia's best-known natural landmarks and an important focus of Aboriginal culture.

==History==
===Early city===
[[Image:Alice_Springs.jpg|thumb|left|200px| "Springs" that gave the town its name]]
In 1862, [[John McDouall Stuart]] led an expedition into Central Australia and the area where Alice Springs is 
located.  Until the 1930s, however, the town was known as Stuart. 
The [[Overland Telegraph|Overland Telegraph Line]] linking [[Adelaide]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] 
and [[Great Britain]] was completed in 1872. It traced Stuart<U+2019>s route and opened up the interior for permanent settlement. It wasn<U+2019>t until 
alluvial gold was discovered at Arltunga, 100 km east of Alice Springs, in 1887 that any significant settlement 
occurred.
[[Image:Araluen0383.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment - Alice Springs Cultural 

Precinct]]

The telegraph station was sited near what was thought to be a permanent waterhole in the normally dry [[Todd River]] 
and was optimistically named Alice Springs after the wife of the former Postmaster General of [[South Australia]], 
Sir [[Charles Todd]]. The Todd River was named after Sir Charles himself. 
The original mode of transportation in the outback were camel trains, operated by immigrants from Pathan tribes in 
the North-West frontier of the then British India and Pakistan who were misnamed <U+2018>Afghan<U+2019> Camellers. 

In 1929 the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway was completed from Darwin as far as Birdum, while the Great Northern 
Railway had been completed in 1891 from Port Augusta as far as Oodnadatta, South Australia, 700 km south of Alice 
Springs.  The lines wouldn<U+2019>t meet until 2003. On February 4, 2004, the first passenger train arrived in Darwin. 

During the 1960s it became an important defence location with the development of the U.S/Australian [[Pine Gap]] 
joint defence satellite monitoring base, home to about 700 workers from both countries, but by far the major industry 
in recent times is [[tourism]]. Almost in the exact center of the continent, Alice Springs is some 1200 km from the nearest ocean and 1500 km from the nearest major cities, Darwin and Adelaide. Alice Springs is now the midpoint of the [[The Ghan|Adelaide<U+2013>Darwin Railway]].[http://www.travelnt.com/en/experience/outback/the-ghan.htm]

===Indigenous history===
[[Image:Alice_Springs4263.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Alice Springs Desert Park, Sand Drawing Aboriginal]]
The [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] Aboriginal people have made their [[Arrernte (area)|home]] in the Central 
Australian desert in and around Alice Springs for more than 50,000 years. The Aboriginal name for Alice Springs is 
Mparntwe. 

According to the Arrernte traditional stories, in the desert surrounding Alice Springs, the landscape was 
shaped by caterpillars, wild dogs, travelling boys, two sisters, euros and other ancestral figures. There are many 
sites of traditional importance in and around Alice Springs, such as Anthwerrke (Emily Gap), Akeyulerre (Billy Goat 
Hill), Ntaripe ([[Heavitree Gap]]), Atnelkentyarliweke (Anzac Hill) and Alhekulyele (Mt. Gillen).

===Modern city===
The modern town of Alice Springs has both western and Aboriginal influences. The town<U+2019>s focal point, the Todd Mall 
hosts a number of Aboriginal art galleries and community events. Alice Springs<U+2019> desert lifestyle has inspired several 
unique and interesting events such as the [[Camel Cup]], the Henley on Todd Regatta and the Beanie Festival.

==Geography and climate== 
===Topography and climate===
The town of Alice Springs straddles the usually dry [[Todd River]] on the northern side of [[MacDonnell Ranges]]. The 
region where Alice Springs is located is known as Central Australia, or the Red Centre, and is an arid environment 
consisting of several different deserts.

In Alice Springs, temperatures can vary by up to 28[[<U+00B0>C]] and rainfall can vary quite dramatically from year to year. 
In summer, the average maximum temperature is in the high 30s, where as in winter the average minimum temperature can 
be -7.5C. 

The annual average rainfall is 286 mm, but in 2001 741 mm fell and in 2002 only 198 mm fell.<ref>[http://www.alicesprings.nt.gov.au/about_alice/climate.asp Alice Springs' Climate]</ref>

small family outstation communities on Aboriginal Lands in surrounding areas.

===American influence===
[[Image:PineGap-sign.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The road to Pine Gap - travelling any closer is prohibited!]]

currently 2,000 people in the Alice Springs district who carry citizenship of the [[United States of America]].
