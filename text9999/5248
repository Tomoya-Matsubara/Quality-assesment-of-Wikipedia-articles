The '''1953 Atlantic hurricane season''' was the first time an organized list of female names was used to name Atlantic storms. It officially began on June&nbsp;15,<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|agency=United Press|newspaper=The Times-News|title=Tiny Hurricane Training Medium for Observers|accessdate=2011-02-08|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YGg1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=xCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3873,6585368&dq=weather+bureau+hurricane+season&hl=en}}</ref> and lasted until November&nbsp;15,<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|date=1953-11-14|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=2011-02-08|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0pgcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yWQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2879,3413031&dq=hurricane&hl=en|title=Hurricane Season Closes Tonight, Scores Better Than Average}}</ref> although activity occurred both before and after the season's limits. It is one of only four seasons to have a pre-season storm and a post-season storm, the others being the [[1887 Atlantic hurricane season|1887]], [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season|2003]], and [[2007 Atlantic hurricane season|2007]] seasons.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The season was active with fourteen&nbsp;total storms, six of which developed into hurricanes; four of the hurricanes attained [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]] status, or a Category&nbsp;3 or greater on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]]. 

The strongest hurricane of the season was [[Hurricane Carol (1953)|Carol]], although by the time it struck [[Atlantic Canada]] it was much weaker. Both hurricanes [[Hurricane Barbara (1953)|Barbara]] and [[Hurricane Florence (1953)|Florence]] struck the United States; the former crossed the [[Outer Banks]] and impacted much of the east coast, and Florence struck a sparsely-populated region of the [[Florida Panhandle]] without causing much damage.  Bermuda was threatened by three hurricanes within two weeks.  In addition to the hurricanes, [[Tropical Storm Alice (1953)|Tropical Storm Alice]] developed in late May and left several fatalities in Cuba. The final named storm of the season, Hazel, produced additional rainfall in Florida after previous flooding conditions. There were several unnamed storms, the last of which dissipated on December&nbsp;9.

On October&nbsp;2, a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression about 815&nbsp;mi (1310&nbsp;km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gail, and the next day, a ship encountered the storm, reporting a minimum pressure of 986&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.12&nbsp;[[Inch of Mercury|inHg]]). As the ship crossed through the center, it reported winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h), indicating Gail attained hurricane status. There were no further observations, and the hurricane was estimated to have turned to the southwest; it weakened, dissipating on October&nbsp;5 about 765&nbsp;mi (1230&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Barbados]].<ref name="mwr"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

On October&nbsp;3, a tropical storm developed near the southern coast of Cuba. It moved northwestward, crossing the island before turning to the northeast. Early on October&nbsp;5, the storm brushed southeastern Florida,{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} producing gusty winds and rainfall. The threat of the storm prompted small craft warnings from the Florida Keys through South Carolina.<ref>{{cite news|title=7th Hurricane Grows; Florida Area Watched|author=Staff Writer|agency=United Press|accessdate=2011-02-04|date=1953-10-04|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zBZZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b0YNAAAAIBAJ&pg=617,890522&dq=florida+storm&hl=en}}</ref> As it accelerated northeastward, the storm strengthened slightly to [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h), before becoming extratropical on October&nbsp;6. Two days later, the remnants moved over Atlantic Canada with winds of 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h),{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} producing flooding rainfall that washed out several roads. The storm killed two deaths after it wrecked a boat in [[Broad Cove, Nova Scotia]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Environment Canada|date=2009-11-09|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=EF5987AB-1|accessdate=2011-02-04|title=1953-NN-3}}</ref> Later, the cyclone passed south of Greenland before dissipating southwest of [[Iceland]] on October&nbsp;10.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

On October&nbsp;5, a tropical storm developed about halfway between Cape Verde and the northern Lesser Antilles. It developed in the same region as Hurricane Gail dissipated. The storm moved generally west-northwestward, reaching peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) about 12&nbsp;hours after it was first observed. Subsequently it began a slow weakening trend, and the system dissipated on October&nbsp;9 about 470&nbsp;mi (755&nbsp;km) north-northeast of [[Barbuda]]. The storm never affected land.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

The twelfth tropical storm and the final named storm of the season formed in the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Channel]] on October&nbsp;7. Given the name Hazel, the storm tracked north-northeastward, then northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico while gradually intensifying. On October&nbsp;9, Hazel made landfall just north of [[Fort Myers, Florida]] at its peak intensity of 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). Peak wind gusts were {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with a minimum pressure of {{convert|987.0|mb|inHg|abbr=on}} reported in [[Okeechobee, Florida|Okeechobee City]]. The storm crossed the state in about six hours, during which it weakened slightly. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, Hazel re-intensified to its peak winds, although by late on October&nbsp;10 it transitioned into an extratropical storm between North Carolina and Bermuda. The remnants continued northeastward, dissipating southeast of Newfoundland on October&nbsp;12.<ref name="mwr"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} On [[Sable Island]], the storm produced heavy winds and rain.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Environment Canada|date=2009-11-09|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=7C9317C9-1|title=Hazel-1953|accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref>

Due to the fairly light winds across Florida, damage from Hazel was minor, estimated around $250,000 (1953&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|250000|1953}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD). During its passage, the storm spawned a tornado in [[St. James City, Florida|St. James City]] that destroyed several homes, and there were indications of another tornado in Okeechobee City. The primary impact from Hazel was from its rainfall,<ref name="mwr"/> peaking at {{convert|10.53|in|mm}} in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]].<ref>{{cite web|author=David M. Roth|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|date=2010-08-17|title=Tropical Storm Hazel - October 6-10, 1953 |url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/hazel1953.html}}</ref> The rains added to previous flooding conditions across the state, causing a record flood stage along the [[St. Johns River]] that flooded {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} of highway. Overall flooding damage was estimated up to $10&nbsp;million (1953&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000000|1953}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD), but it was impossible to determine how much was due to Hazel.<ref name="mwr"/>

A tropical storm developed on November&nbsp;23 about 460&nbsp;mi (740&nbsp;km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) on November&nbsp;24. It later turned sharply to the west as it began a weakening trend, followed by a curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November&nbsp;26 about 450&nbsp;mi (725&nbsp;km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

The final tropical cyclone of the season developed on December&nbsp;7 about 705&nbsp;mi (1735&nbsp;km) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles as a tropical depression. The first [[List of off-season Atlantic hurricanes|December storm]] since [[1925 Florida hurricane|1925]], it tracked generally westward, briefly intensifying into a tropical storm on December&nbsp;8. The next day it dissipated about 270&nbsp;mi (435&nbsp;km) north of the Lesser Antilles.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

== Storm names ==
These names were used to name storms during the 1953 season. The list was the same for the [[1954 Atlantic hurricane season|1954 season]] as well. Initially, all female names were used; it was not until the [[1979 Atlantic hurricane season|1979 season]] that male and female names were used in alternating order. Names that were not assigned are marked in {{tcname unused}}.
All storm names were named for the first time.<ref name="gp">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|date=June 2007|title=History of the Naming of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones, Part 1 - The Fabulous Fifties|accessdate=2011-02-08|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2008/summ0707.htm|publisher=Australian Severe Weather}}</ref> No names were [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|retired]].
