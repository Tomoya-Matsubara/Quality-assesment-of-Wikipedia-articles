He was elected to a lay fellowship on the Beresford foundation of his college on [[21 March]] 1726, but was removed in favour of [[Michael Burton]] (afterwards vice-master of St. John's), who claimed [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|founder's kin]]. Pegge was then made an honorary fellow, and in 1729 was elected a ' Platt ' fellow of St. John's. In 1730 he was elected a member of the [[Spalding Society]], to which he contributed some papers, and from 1730 to 1732 belonged to the [[Zodiac Club]], a college literary society consisting of twelve members denominated by the signs of the zodiac.

Pegge was ordained in 1729, and in 1730 became curate to Dr. [[John Lynch]] at [[Sundridge]] in [[Kent]]. On [[6 December]] 1731 he was inducted into the vicarage of [[Godmersham]], Kent, where he lived for about twenty years, writing on antiquities and collecting books and coins. From 1749 to 1751 he lived at [[Surrenden]], Kent, as tutor to the son of Sir Edward Dering. In 1751 he was elected fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries]], and in the same year was inducted into the rectory of [[Old Whittington]], near Chesterfield, exchanging Godmersham for the rectory of Brinhill (or Brindle), Lancashire. On 22 Oct. 1758 he exchanged Brinhill for the vicarage of [[Heath, Derbyshire|Heath]], near Whittington, holding Heath together with Whittington until his death. 
In 1765 he was presented to the perpetual curacy of [[Wingerworth]], near Whittington. 
He was a prebendary of [[Lichfield]] (1757-1796), and in 1772 was collated to a stall in 
[[Lincoln Cathedral]]. In 1791 he was created LL.D. by the [[University of Oxford]]. He died, after a fortnight's illness, on [[14 February|Saint Valentines day]] in 1796 at the age of 92. He was buried in the chancel at Whittington, where a mural tablet was installed. His small collection of English coins and medals were sold by auction on [[23 March]] 1797. <ref name=DNB/>

July 1746), daughter of Benjamin Clarke of [[Stanley]], near [[Wakefield]], Yorkshire, and they had three children : Christopher (died in infancy), [[Samuel Pegge (the younger)|Samuel (the younger)]], and Anna Katharine, wife of the Rev. John Bourne of [[Spital]], near Chesterfield. A portrait of Pegge, drawn by [[Gustavus Brander]], and engraved by [[James Basire]], is prefixed to Pegge's [[Forme of Cury]] (see illustration above) however there was an oil-painting of him (reputed a better likeness) by [[Elias Needham]].<ref name=DNB/>

==Contributions==
Pegge contributed to the first ten volumes of the [[Archaeologia]] memoirs on a great variety of topics, such as Anglo-Saxon jewellery ; the introduction of the vine into Britain; the stylus: [[King Alfred]]; the 'bull-running ' at [[Tutbury]] ; the horn as a charter or instrument of conveyance ; shoeing horses among the ancients ; [[cock-fighting]] ; the right of sanctuary ; the manner of [[King John]]'s death ; Kits Cojry house ; the commencement of day among the Saxons and Britons ; ' the mistaken opinion that Ireland and the Isle of Thanet are void of Serpents and prehistoric remains generally.' He wrote seven memoirs in the ' [[Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica]],' including ' The Story of Guy, Earl of Warwick' (1783); 'The History of [[Eccleshall Manor]]' (1784); 'The Roman Roads of Derbyshire ' (1784)<ref name=sam2/> ; 'The Textus Roffensis ' (1784) ; ' History of [[Bolsover]] and Peak Castles, Derbyshire' (1783). He also wrote a large number of articles for the ' [[Gentleman's Magazine]] ' from 1746 to 1795, signing himself ' Paul Gemsege ? ( = Samuel Pegge), ' T. Row ' ( = the rector of Wkittington), and 'L. E.' ( = [Samue]! [Pegg]e) . While vicar of Godmersham Pegge made collections relating to Kent, including a ' Monasticon Cantianum ' in two folio manuscript volumes, and an account of the antiquities of Wye.
