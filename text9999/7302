Crocker's earliest experience with online networking was as an editor of an [[online magazine|e-zine]], where he met his first boyfriend, with whom he only was able to interact online and by phone. Crocker later found another online forum, where his acting skills helped him blend in on a free phone party line run out of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] "filled with flaming black men, black [[drag queen]]s, and [[transgender|trannies]] from [[Compton, California|Compton]]", where he was recently outed as [[white people|white]] and dubbed "[[Cracker (pejorative)|Cracker]]".<ref name="thestranger"/> In June 2006, after years of experience on the Internet, Crocker started uploading self-produced videos, characterized as his "singularly bizarre and angry take on gay life and his [[toleration|intolerant]] town".<ref name="thestranger"/> 
===Building a following===
Although his chart-topping video defending Britney Spears drew the attention of the wider public, Crocker had already become one of the most-watched video producers on MySpace and YouTube,<ref name="salon1" /><ref name="Variety deal" /> having gathered what [[MSNBC]] described as a "[[cult following]]".<ref name="'Leave Britney Alone!': Tear-stained" /> Prior to Crocker's defense of Spears, some of the more than sixty videos he had posted to the two [[social networking service|social networking]] websites had already been viewed more than a million times,<ref name="salon1"/> and his YouTube channel was in the top rankings. In May 2007, Crocker was the subject of a lengthy profile in the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] [[alternative weekly]] [[The Stranger (newspaper)|''The Stranger'']].<ref name="thestranger" /> His rise to "[[personal web page|pseudo-celebrity]]" status mirrors the recent success of the [[video clip|online video]] business from early 2006 through 2007,<ref name="US online video popularity keeps">{{cite web
