The '''Black Stone''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+062D><U+062C><U+0631> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0623><U+0633><U+0648><U+062F>}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|al-<U+1E24>ajar al-Aswad}}'') is the eastern cornerstone of the [[Kaaba]], the ancient stone building toward which [[Muslim]]s pray, in the center of the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]] in [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is revered by Muslims as an [[Islam]]ic relic, which, according to Muslim tradition, dates back to the time of [[Adam and Eve]].<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum]] (The Sealed Nectar): Biography of the Prophet|author=Sheikh Safi-ur-Rehman al-Mubarkpuri|isbn=1-59144-071-8|year=2002|publisher=Dar-us-Salam Publications}}</ref>

The stone was venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. It was set intact into the Kaaba's wall by the [[Islamic]] [[Prophets of Islam|Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] in the year 605 A.D., five years before his [[Muhammad's first revelation|first revelation]]. Since then it has been broken into a number of fragments and is now cemented into a silver frame in the side of the Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of millions of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from Heaven to show Adam and Eve where to build an altar. Although it has often been described as a meteorite, this hypothesis is now uncertain.<ref name="Burke" />

Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba as part of the [[Tawaf]] ritual of the [[Hajj]]. Many of them try, if possible, to stop and kiss the Black Stone, emulating the kiss that Islamic tradition records that it received from Muhammad.<ref>{{cite book|title=Your Door to Arabia|last=Elliott|first=Jeri|year=1992|isbn= 0-473-01546-3|publisher=R.

==Physical description==
The Black Stone consists of a number of fragments held together by a silver frame, which is fastened by silver nails to the Stone.<ref name="bevan"/> Some of the smaller fragments have been cemented together to form the seven or eight fragments visible today. The Stone's exposed face measures about {{convert|20|cm|in}} by {{convert|16|cm|in}}. Its original size is unclear; its recorded dimensions have changed considerably over time, as the stone has been remodelled on several occasions. In the 10th century, an observer described it as being one [[cubit]] (slightly over {{convert|1.5|ft|m}}) long. By the early 17th century, it was recorded as measuring {{convert|1.5|yd|m}} by {{convert|1.33|yd|m}}. According to [[Ali Bey]] in the 18th century, it was {{convert|42|in|cm}} high, and [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] reported it as being {{convert|2.5|ft|m}} long by {{convert|1.5|ft|m}} wide.<ref name="Burke">{{cite book|last=Burke|first=John G.|title=Cosmic Debris: Meteorites in History|publisher=University of California Press|pages=221<U+2013>223|year=1991|isbn=978-0-520-07396-8}}</ref>

The Black Stone was first described in Western literature in the 19th and early 20th centuries by European travellers in Arabia, who visited the Kaaba in the guise of pilgrims. [[Swiss]] traveler [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] visited Mecca in 1814, and provided a detailed description in his 1829 book ''Travels in Arabia'':

{{bquote|It is an irregular oval, about seven inches in diameter, with an undulated surface, composed of about a dozen smaller stones of different sizes and shapes, well joined together with a small quantity of cement, and perfectly well smoothed; it looks as if the whole had been broken into as many pieces by a violent blow, and then united again. It is very difficult to determine accurately the quality of this stone which has been worn to its present surface by the millions of touches and kisses it has received. It appeared to me like a lava, containing several small extraneous particles of a whitish and of a yellow substance. Its colour is now a deep reddish brown approaching to black. It is surrounded on all sides by a border composed of a substance which I took to be a close cement of pitch and gravel of a similar, but not quite the same, brownish colour. This border serves to support its detached pieces; it is two or three inches in breadth, and rises a little above the surface of the stone. Both the border and the stone itself are encircled by a silver band, broader below than above, and on the two sides, with a considerable swelling below, as if a part of the stone were hidden under it. The lower part of the border is studded with silver nails.<ref name="Hughes">Quoted in Thomas Patrick Hughes, ''A Dictionary of Islam'', p. 154. W. H. Allen & Co, 1885</ref>}}

Visiting the Kaaba in 1853, Sir [[Richard Francis Burton]] noted that:

{{bquote|The colour appeared to me black and metallic, and the centre of the stone was sunk about two inches below the metallic circle. Round the sides was a reddish brown cement, almost level with the metal, and sloping down to the middle of the stone. The band is now a massive arch of gold or silver gilt. I found the aperture in which the stone is, one span and three fingers broad.<ref name="Hughes" />}}

Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian consul-general in [[Egypt]], was able to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported that it had a pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow spots on the face of the Stone, and it is officially described as being white with the exception of the face.<ref name="Burke" />

The frame around the Black Stone and the black ''[[kiswah]]'' or cloth enveloping the Kaaba were for centuries maintained by the [[Ottoman Sultan]]s in their role as [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]]. The frames wore out over time due to the constant handling by pilgrims and were periodically replaced. Worn-out frames were brought back to [[Istanbul]], where they are still kept as part of the [[Sacred Relics]] in the [[Topkap<U+0131> Palace]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The sacred trusts: Pavilion of the Sacred Relics, Topkap<U+0131> Palace Museum|last=Ayd<U+0131>n|first=Hilmi|publisher=Tughra Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-932099-72-0}}</ref>

The Black Stone was revered well before the preaching of Islam by [[Muhammad]]. By the time of Muhammad, it was already associated with the Kaaba, a pre-Islamic shrine that was revered as a sacred sanctuary and a site of pilgrimage. In her book, ''Islam: A Short History'', [[Karen Armstrong]] asserts that the Kaaba was dedicated to [[Hubal]], a Nabatean deity, and contained 360 idols which either represented the days of the year, or were effigies of the Arabian pantheon. The [[Semitic]] cultures of the Middle East had a tradition of using unusual stones to mark places of worship, a phenomenon which is reflected in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as the [[Qur'an]].<ref name="glasse" /> A "red stone" was associated with the deity of the south Arabian city of [[Ghaiman]], and there was a "white stone" in the Kaaba of al-Abalat (near the city of [[Tabala (Arabia)|Tabala]], south of Mecca). Worship at that time period was often associated with stone [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]], mountains, special rock formations, or distinctive trees.<ref>{{cite book|author=Grunebaum, G. E. von|title=Classical Islam: A History 600 A.D.<U+2013>1258 A.D.|publisher=Aldine Publishing Company|page=24|year=1970|isbn=202-15016-X}}</ref> The Kaaba marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane, and the embedded Black Stone was a further symbol of this as an object that linked heaven and earth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|page=221|year=1996|publisher=A.A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-43596-9}}</ref>

Muhammad is credited with setting the Black Stone in place in the wall of the Kaaba. A story found in [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah]]'' tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place. They decided to wait for the next man to come through the gate and ask him to make the decision. That individual happened to be the 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his prophethood. He asked the elders of the clans to bring him a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. Each of the clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and carried the Black Stone to the right spot. Then Muhammad himself set the stone in place, satisfying the honour of all of the clans.<ref name="Dairesi">{{cite book|title=The sacred trusts: Pavilion of the Sacred Relics, Topkap<U+0131> Palace Museum, Istanbul|editor1=U<U+011F>urluel, Talha|editor2=Do<U+011F>ru, Ahmet|author1=Dairesi, H<U+0131>rka-i Saadet|author2=Ayd<U+0131>n, Hilmi|publisher=Tughra Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-932099-72-0}}</ref>

The Stone has suffered desecrations and significant damage over the centuries. It is said to have been struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the [[Umayyad]] siege of Mecca in 756. The fragments were rejoined by 'Abd Allah ibn Zubayr using a silver ligament.<ref name="Dairesi" /> In January 930 it was stolen by the [[Qarmatian]]s, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern [[Bahrain]]). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Qarmati set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the ''Masjid al-Dirar'', with the intention of redirecting the Hajj away from Mecca. However, this failed, and pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.<ref name="Peters">{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Francis E.|title=Mecca: a literary history of the Muslim Holy Land|pages=125<U+2013>126|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1994|isbn=978-0-691-03267-2}}</ref>

According to historian [[Al-Juwayni]], the Stone was returned twenty-three years later, in 952. The Qarmatians held the Black Stone for ransom, and forced the Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return. It was wrapped in a sack and thrown into the Friday Mosque of [[Kufa]], accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back." Its abduction and removal caused further damage, breaking the stone into seven pieces.<ref name="glasse"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html|title=Qarmatiyyah|publisher=St. Martin's College|work=Overview of World Religions|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/68328/Black-Stone-of-Mecca|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=Black Stone of Mecca (Islam)|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Its abductor, Abu Tahir, is said to have met a terrible fate; according to Qutb al-Din, "the filthy Abu Tahir was afflicted with a gangrenous sore, his flesh was eaten away by worms, and he died a most terrible death."<ref name="Peters" />

In the 11th century, a man allegedly sent by the [[Fatimid]] Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] attempted to smash the Black Stone, but was killed on the spot, having caused only slight damage.<ref name="Peters" /> In 1674, according to Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, someone smeared the Black Stone with excrement so that "every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard". The [[Shi'ite]] [[Persia]]ns were suspected of being responsible and were the target of curses from other Muslims for centuries afterwards, though explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton doubted that they were the culprits; he attributed the act to "some Jew or Greek, who risked his life to gratify a furious bigotry."<ref>{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Richard Francis|title=Personal narrative of a pilgrimage to El-Madinah and Meccah|page=394|publisher=G. P. Putnam & Co.|year=1856}}</ref>

==Ritual role==
The Black Stone plays an important role in the central ritual of the [[Hajj]], when pilgrims must walk seven times around the Kaaba in an counterclockwise direction. They attempt to kiss the Black Stone seven times, once for each circumambulation of the Kaaba, emulating the actions of the [[Islamic Prophet]] Muhammad. In modern times, large crowds make it practically impossible for everyone to kiss the stone, so it is currently acceptable for pilgrims to simply point in the direction of the Stone on each of their circuits around the building. Some even say that the Stone is best considered simply as a marker, useful in keeping count of the ritual circumambulations (''[[Hajj#Performing the Hajj|tawaf]]'') that one has performed.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Saudi Arabia Information Resource|title=The Holy City of Makkah|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2006|url= http://www.saudinf.com/main/a83.htm}}</ref> Its black colour is deemed to symbolize the essential spiritual virtue of detachment and poverty for God (''[[faqr]]'') and the extinction of ego required to progress towards God (''[[qalb]]'').<ref name="glasse" />

Writing in ''Dawn in Madinah: A Pilgrim's Progress'', [[Muzaffar Iqbal]] described his experience of venerating the Black Stone during a pilgrimage to Mecca:

{{quote|At the end of the second [circumabulation of the Kaaba], I was granted one of those extraordinary moments which sometimes occur around the Black Stone. As I approached the Corner the large crowd was suddenly pushed back by a strong man who had just kissed the Black Stone. This push generated a backward current, creating a momentary opening around the Black Stone as I came to it; I swiftly accepted the opportunity reciting, ''Bismillahi Allahu akbar wa lillahi-hamd'' ["In the name of God, God is great, all praise to God"], put my hands on the Black Stone and kissed it. Thousands of silver lines sparkled, the Stone glistened, and something stirred deep inside me. A few seconds passed. Then I was pushed away by the guard.<ref>{{cite book|last=Iqbal|first=Muzaffar|title=Dawn in Madinah: A Pilgrim's Progress|page=21|publisher=The Other Press|year=2007|isbn=978-983-9154-92-4}}</ref>}}

==Meaning and symbolism==
The Black Stone, in Muslim belief, originated in the time of [[Adam]]. According to the [[Hadith]], "it descended from Paradise whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black".<ref>Saying of the Prophet, Collection of [[Tirmizi]],  VII, 49</ref> According to belief, an angel spoke to the great prophet [[Abraham]], and told him to institute the rite of the stone in the hajj at Mecca.<ref>''Muhammad'', Martin Lings, Chapter 1. The House of God</ref>

Islamic tradition holds that the Stone fell from [[Jannat|Heaven]] to show [[Adam and Eve]] where to build an altar, which became the first temple on Earth. Muslims believe that the stone was originally pure and dazzling white, but has since turned black because of the sins of the people.<ref>[[Shaykh Tabarsi]], ''Tafsir'', vol. 1, pp. 460, 468. Quoted in translation by Francis E. Peters, ''Muhammad and the Origins of Islam'', p. 5. [[SUNY Press]], 1994. ISBN 0-7914-1876-6</ref> Adam's altar and the stone were said to have been lost during [[Noah]]'s [[Great Flood|Flood]] and forgotten. [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] was said to have later found the Black Stone at the original site of Adam's altar when the angel [[Jibrail]] revealed it to him.<ref name="glasse">Cyril Glasse, ''New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 245. Rowman Altamira, 2001. ISBN 0-7591-0190-6</ref> Ibrahim ordered his son [[Ismael]]<U+2014>who is an ancestor of Muhammad<U+2014>to build a new temple, the Kaaba, in which to embed the Stone.

Islam strictly prohibits [[idolatry]]. Muslims believe that the Stone's role in hajj is simply representative and symbolic in nature, not related to belief in the stone itself as having any special power. A [[hadith]] records that, when the second [[Caliph]] [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (580-644) came to kiss the Stone, he said in front of all assembled: "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [Muhammad] kissing you, I would not have kissed you."<ref>{{cite web|author=University of Southern California|title=Pilgrimage (Hajj)|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2006|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/026.sbt.html#002.026.667}}</ref> Most Muslims follow the example of Umar: they pay their respects to the Stone in a spirit of trust in [[Muhammad]], not with any inherent belief in the Stone. This, however, does not indicate their disrespect to the Black Stone, but their belief that harm and benefit are in the hands of God, and nothing else. [[Muhammad Labib al-Batanuni]], writing in 1911, commented that the pre-Islamic practice of venerating stones (including the Black Stone) arose not because such stones are "sacred for their own sake, but because of their relation to something holy and respected." <ref name="Lazarus-Yafeh">{{cite book|last=Lazarus-Yafeh|first=Hava|title=Some religious aspects of Islam: a collection of articles|pages=120<U+2013>124|publisher=Brill|year=1981|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-06329-7}}</ref> The Indian Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Hamidullah]] summed up the meaning of the Black Stone:

{{quote|[T]he Prophet has named the (Black Stone) the 'right hand of God' (''yamin-Allah''), and for purpose. In fact one poses there one's hand to conclude the pact, and God obtains there our pact of allegiance and submission. In the qur'anic terminology, God is the king, and ... in (his) realm there is a metropolis (''Umm al-Qurra'') and in the metropolis naturally a palace (''Bait-Allah'', home of God). If a subject wants to testify to his loyalty, he has to go to the royal palace and conclude personally the pact of allegiance. The right hand of the invisible God must be visible symbolically. And that is the ''al-Hajar al-Aswad'', the Black Stone in the Ka'bah.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shenk|first=David W.|title=Journeys of the Muslim nation and the Christian church: exploring the mission of two communities|page=161|publisher=Uzima Publishing House|year=2006|isbn=978-9966-855-21-3}}</ref>}}

In recent years, however, literalist views of the Black Stone have emerged. A small minority accepts as literally true an allegorical hadith which asserts that "the Stone will appear on the Day of Judgement ([[Qiyamah]]) with eyes to see and a tongue to speak, and give evidence in favor of all who kissed it in true devotion, but speak out against whoever indulged in gossip or profane conversations during his circumambulation of the Kaaba".<ref name="Lazarus-Yafeh" />

==Scientific origins==
The nature of the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been described variously as [[basalt]] stone, an [[agate]], a piece of natural [[glass]] or <U+2014> most popularly <U+2014> a stony [[meteorite]]. [[Paul Partsch]], the curator of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive history of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.<ref name="Burke" /> A significant clue to its nature is provided by an account of the Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, basalt lava or stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or [[pumice]].<ref name="bevan">Alex Bevan, John De Laeter, ''Meteorites: A Journey Through Space and Time'', pp. 14-15. UNSW Press, 2002. ISBN 0-86840-490-X</ref>

Elsebeth Thomsen of the [[University of Copenhagen]] proposed a different hypothesis in 1980. She suggested that the Black Stone may be a glass fragment or [[impactite]] from the impact of a fragmented meteorite that fell some 6,000 years ago at [[Wabar craters|Wabar]],<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1980Metic..15...87T ''New Light on the Origin of the Holy Black Stone of the Ka'ba'']. Author: Thomsen, E. Journal: Meteoritics, volume 15, number 1, page 87</ref> a site in the [[Rub' al Khali]] desert some 1,100&nbsp;km east of Mecca. The craters at Wabar are notable for the presence of blocks of [[silica]] glass, fused by the heat of the impact and impregnated by beads of nickel-iron alloy from the meteorite (most of which was destroyed in the impact). Some of the glass blocks are made of shiny black glass with a white or yellow interior and gas-filled hollows, which allow them to float on water. Although scientists did not become aware of the [[Wabar craters]] until 1932, they were located near a caravan route from [[Oman]] and were very likely known to the inhabitants of the desert. The wider area was certainly well-known; in ancient Arabic poetry, Wabar or Ubar (also known as "[[Iram of the Pillars]]") was the site of a fabulous city that was destroyed by fire from the heavens because of the wickedness of its king. If the estimated age of the crater is accurate, it would have been well within the period of human habitation in Arabia and the impact itself may have been witnessed.<ref name="bevan"/> However, a recent (2004) scientific analysis of the Wabar site suggests that the impact event happened much more recently than first thought and might have occurred only within the last 200<U+2013>300 years.<ref>Prescott, J.R., Robertson, G.B., Shoemaker, C., Shoemaker, E.M. and Wynn, J. (2004) "Luminescence dating of the Wabar meteorite craters, Saudi Arabia", ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', '''109''' (E01008), {{doi|10.1029/2003JE002136}}</ref> The meteoritic hypothesis is now seen as doubtful, and the British [[Natural History Museum]] suggests that it may be a pseudometeorite, i.e., a terrestrial rock mistakenly attributed to a meteoritic origin.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catalogue of meteorites: with special reference to those represented in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London|volume=1|page=263|editor=Grady, Monica M.|author1=Grady, Monica M.|author2=Graham, A.L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-66303-8}}</ref>
