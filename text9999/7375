'''CSS''' '''''Lady Davis''''' was a [[gunboat]] in the [[Confederate States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]].

Originally the Richmond iron steam tug ''James Gray'', built at [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in [[1858]], ''Lady Davis'' was purchased in March [[1861]] by [[Governor]] [[Francis Wilkinson Pickens]] of [[South Carolina]], who armed her and placed in command [[Lieutenant]] [[William Gaillard Dozier]], [[South Carolina Navy]], with orders to thwart reinforcement of [[Fort Sumter]] by [[United States|Union]] troops.

On [[May 7]], [[1861]] ''Lady Davis'' was purchased by the [[Confederate States|Confederacy]] for $32,000 and commissioned in the Confederate Navy, operating thereafter along the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and South Carolina coasts. Lieutenant [[Thomas P. Pelot]], CSN, took command about 5 days later, relieving Lieutenant [[Edward Cantey Stockton]], South Carolina Navy. At that time, the little gunboat served as flagship of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Josiah Tattnall]]'s Savannah Defense Squadron, consisting of [[CSS Savannah (gunboat)|CSS ''Savannah'']], [[CSS Sampson|CSS ''Sampson'']] and [[CSS Resolute|CSS ''Resolute'']].

On [[May 19]], ''Lady Davis'' began her career with distinction by capturing and taking into [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], South Carolina the ''A. B. Thompson'', a full-rigged ship of 980 tons and a crew of 23 out of [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]], [[Maine]], whom she encountered off Savannah while on an expedition seeking the U.S. armed brig Perry. The exploit culminated in acrimonious litigation to decide whether an Army captain and a dozen of his soldiers should share in the prize money. [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] [[Stephen Elliott, Jr.]], [[Confederate States Army|CSA]], happened to be on board and acted as pilot during the capture and afterward, while his men claimed to have helped bring in the prize.

On the following day, the crew were reenlisted into the Confederate States Navy, the State officers being replaced by regulars between then and [[June 1]]. ''Lady Davis'''s rifled gun remained the property of South Carolina, on loan, while the other, a 24-pounder howitzer, was a gift outright to the Confederacy. By November, Lieutenant John Rutledge commanded her.

She joined in the battle of [[Port Royal, South Carolina]] on [[November 7]], [[1861]]. Although her engines were transferred to [[CSS Palmetto State|CSS ''Palmetto State'']] late in [[1862]], well built iron hulls were in great demand and she was able to continue her successful career as a privately owned [[blockade runner]] out of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. With the occupation of Charleston in [[1865]] by Federal forces, ''Lady Davis'' was captured and turned over to the Light House Board by [[Admiral]] [[John A. Dahlgren]], who praised her hull, while noting that she was, again, minus her machinery, whose disposition is not recorded.
