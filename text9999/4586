==Knifemaking==

Terzuola's first knives were fixed blade designs, made for soldiers in Guatemala.  In 1981 he relocated to [[Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]] and began making folding knives.  Seeing a need for a knife that could be carried discreetly he developed a model using black micarta for the scales and bead-blasted titanium bolsters; for this effort he coined the term "Tactical Knife".<ref name=tactical>{{cite book| last=Terzuola|first= Robert|authorlink=Robert Terzuola|year=2000|title=The Tactical Folding Knife: A Study of the Anatomy and Construction of the Liner-Locked Folder|publisher= Krause Publications|location = Iola, Wisconsin|ISBN =0873418581}}</ref>

Terzuola has authored a book about the design of tactical knives and has authored articles about tactical knives and knifemaking for ''[[Blade (magazine)|Blade]]'', ''[[Soldier of Fortune]]'' and other publications.  In 2006 he relocated his shop to [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico.<ref name=tactical/>
