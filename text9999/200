The '''[[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] Premier''' was a [[full-size car|full-size]] [[automobile]] developed by the [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) and [[Renault]] partnership, inherited by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] when it acquired AMC in 1987, and marketed from 1987 through 1992. A [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] variant was also marketed as the '''[[Dodge Monaco]]''' from 1990 to 1992.

==Design==
In 1982 [[American Motors]] and [[Renault]], a major shareholder in AMC since 1979, began work on a new [[full-size car|full-size]] [[front-wheel drive|front-drive]] passenger car, code named X58. It was to be the first large car sold by AMC since 1974, a position in their model range traditionally occupied by the [[Nash Ambassador|Nash]] and [[AMC Ambassador]] models since the 1930s.

Rather than engineer a completely new chassis for the Premier the then-new [[Renault 25]]'s [[monocoque]] underpinnings were used as a basis and adapted for the new product.<ref name=roth>{{cite web| url = http://www.autoblog.com/2007/04/16/future-classic-eagle-premier/ |last=Roth | first=Dan | title =Future Classic: Eagle Premier | publisher=autoblog com | date =16 April 2007 | accessdate=31 October 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Mike |last=Covello |first2=James M. |last2=Flammang |title=Standard Catalog of Imported Cars 1946-2002 | publisher=Krause Publications|year=2002 |isbn= 9780873416054 |quote=The Giugiaro-styled Eagle Premier of the late 1980s and early '90s, though built in North America, was a rebodied version of Renault's 25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Car and Driver |volume=37 |http://books.google.com/books?id=dD5WAAAAMAAJ&q=Eagle+Premier+Renault+25&dq=Eagle+Premier+Renault+25&hl=en ||publisher=Hachette Magazines |year=1992 |page=164 |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> Stretched in all dimensions, it provided more interior room than any of its contemporaries. The exterior by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro|Giorgietto Giugiaro]]'s [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]] was picked over other concepts generated by AMC's own styling department and other independent firms.

Using the Renault 25 chassis<ref>{{cite journal|title=Autocar & Motor |volume=185|page=7|publisher=Haymarket, Pub., Ltd.|year=1990|quote=...the US firm guaranteed the sale of 300,000 of AMC's Renault 25-based models, now known as the Eagle Premier.}}</ref> the suspension was derived from the Renault Medallion (Renault 21).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Engineering the New Cars|journal=Popular Mechanics|year=1987|month=October|volume=164|issue=10| accessdate=31 October 2010 | page=136 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zOMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA139&dq=Premier+suspension+Renault+Medallion&hl=en}}</ref> The suspension featured a four-wheel independent system with [[MacPherson strut]]s at the front wheels and two [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bar]]s at each rear wheel, with [[sway bar|stabilizer bar]]s in both front and rear.

The interior was an all-new design by AMC's in-house staff under the direction of [[Richard A. Teague]]. It was considered unique at the time. The climate controls used an unusual up-down button that cycled through the different heating modes, indicated by an array of lights. All of these controls were housed in a control panel on the right side of the steering column. On the left side of the column another control contained the light and windshield wiper controls.

There was a choice of two [[powertrain]]s. Eschewing the Renault 25's French-built four-cylinder engines, the base Premier ''LX'' trim featured a standard [[AMC Straight-4 engine|2.5 L AMC four-cylinder]] engine. Featuring electronically-controlled throttle-body [[fuel injection]], it developed a peak power output of {{convert|111|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|142|lb.ft|Nm|0|abbr=off}} of torque&nbsp; at 1400 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], and was coupled to a new electronically-controlled four-speed automatic gearbox, co-designed by Renault and [[Volkswagen]]. Optional in the LX and standard in ''ES'' models was a 3.0&nbsp;L version of the well-known [[PRV engine|Peugeot-Renault-Volvo V6 engine]], fitted with multiple port fuel injection, producing peak power and torque figures of  {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|171|lb.ft|Nm|0|abbr=off}}. Factory acceleration estimates from [[0 to 60 mph|standstill to 60 miles per hour]] (96&nbsp;km/h) were 11.5 seconds with the four-cylinder, and 10 seconds with the six.

The Premier was "final offspring of the AMC-Renault marriage" and the new car entered the marketplace "well endowed in just about every department. It has the most powerful conventional engines in its field, state-of-the-art electronics with a first-ever feature, and is made in the newest assembly plant in the world."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Engineering the New Cars|journal=Popular Mechanics|year=1987|month=October|volume=164|issue=10| accessdate=31 October 2010 | page=136 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=zOMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA138&dq=Premier+final+offspring+of+AMC&hl=en}}</ref>

== Model years ==
=== 1988 ===
The Premier was initially to be called the '''Renault Premier''' (mid-1988 production left the factory with Renault badging, and Eagle had to indicate this difference in its dealer information brochures and videos) in fitting with the other Renault products co-designed with and built by AMC for sale in North America ([[Renault Alliance|Alliance]] & [[Renault Encore|Encore]]). It was to have been the first body-style in a series of three, along with a four-door wagon and a two-door [[coupe]], named ''Renault Allure''. After Chrysler purchased AMC from Renault, the wagon and coupe body styles were cancelled as was a planned Premier ''DL'' model featuring a five-speed manual gearbox. The car was renamed '''Eagle Premier''', the new marque taking its name from [[AMC Eagle|AMC<U+2019>s last product]].

The interior of the LX featured standard six-passenger seating, with [[bench seat]]s in both front and rear. The standard four-speed automatic transmissions were therefore operated using a column shifter. The ES models had seating for five, with [[bucket seat|buckets]] in front in place of the bench. These buckets seats were optional in the LX, and a [[Center console (automobile)|console]] mounted gear shift was optional in both LX and ES.

=== 1989 ===
The second model year introduced motorized shoulder belts as standard equipment. The Premier saw almost no other changes except for the addition of cruise control and the mid-year introduction of an ''ES Limited'' model featuring monochromatic paint and body colored trim.<ref name=sweat/> 

=== 1990 ===
In 1990 the Premier was substantially re-engineered. Standard were 4-wheel disc brakes and a stainless steel exhaust system.  The entire electrical system was replaced with standard Chrysler parts, which proved to be more reliable than the original [[Renix]] system. The exterior was changed slightly, the ''Design Giugiaro'' badges being removed from the front fenders as a result. The (unpopular) four-cylinder engine was officially dropped from the lineup, with the V6 remaining as the sole engine.

Because of its design "as up-to-date as anything in the mid-sized market" the Premier now became the foundation for Chrysler's next generation of automobiles.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Jim|title=Inside Detroit|journal=Popular Mechanics|year=1989|month=September|volume=166|issue=9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a-QDAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA45&dq=1990+Eagle+Premier&hl=en&ei=_eA_TLWYPIT58AbP-9S-Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=1990%20Eagle%20Premier&f=false|accessdate=15 July 2010|page=45}}</ref>

=== 1991 ===
The 1991 model year Premier featured anti-lock brakes. They came standard on the ES Limited and optional on other models.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gite|first=Lloyd|title=Family Comfort|journal=Black Enterprise|year=1990|month=November|volume=21|issue=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t14EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT121&dq=1991+Eagle+Premier&hl=en&ei=S-M_TMT_JsT68Aax0vWLCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=1991%20Eagle%20Premier&f=false|accessdate=15 July 2010|page=122}}</ref>  The Limited model was treated to a new front grill and rear tail lamp assemblies.

The marketplace saw a downturn and all automakers began offering incentives to move inventory. At the beginning of the year, supplies of the Eagle Premier climbed up to 222 days and Chrysler gave a $1,000 discount to dealers on the invoice price, a $1,500 rebate to purchasers, and a $2,000 incentive to the dealer per car after their fourth sale.<ref name="bargains">{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Ed|title=Bargains: Cars|journal=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|year=1991|month=July|volume=45|issue=7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aQQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47&dq=1991+Eagle+Premier&hl=en&ei=S-M_TMT_JsT68Aax0vWLCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=1991%20Eagle%20Premier&f=false|accessdate=15 July 2010|page=47}}</ref> An ES Limited model listing for $19,978 was only $15,478 after the incentives.<ref name="bargains"/> By the end of the year, dealers had low inventories of Premiers <U+2013> with only 28 days supply <U+2013> compared to 119 days for overstocked cars such as the Chevrolet Caprice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Ed|title=The '91 cars How to get the car you want at at a price you'll like|journal=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|year=1990|month=December|volume=44|issue=12|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tAMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA31&dq=1991+Eagle+Premier&hl=en&ei=S-M_TMT_JsT68Aax0vWLCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Premier&f=false|page=31}}</ref>

=== 1992 ===
The Eagle Premier continued basically unchanged for 1992 except every model received the grill and tail lamps that were only on the Limited in 1991. Chrysler also announced it would be the Premier's final year as the automaker prepared to launch all its new LH models in the Bramalea assembly plant.

==Legacy==

In its time the car was considered one of the sportiest sedans (by measure of road holding and drive precision) available on the American market.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = McCosh | first = Dan | title = Luxury for Less | journal = Popular Science | volume = 233  | issue = 1 | pages = 28<U+2013>32 | date = July 1988  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=R4zUHMZQudoC&pg=PA30&dq=Eagle+Premier&ei=8ys0S9-qH4b-zATq7LCzAQ&client=safari&cd=4#v=onepage&q=Eagle%20Premier&f=false | accessdate = 2009-12-24 }}</ref> The fully [[independent suspension]] on all the wheels made for better [[ride quality]] and [[car handling|handling]] characteristics, as did the [[rack and pinion]] steering design. "The Premier was for its size, the lightest car that Chrysler built at the time [with a shipping weight of {{convert|2999|lb|kg|abbr=on}}], the stiffest (torsionally), and the best riding almost {{convert|8.7|in|mm}} of wheel travel vs. 4.5 for the K-cars that underpinned every Chrysler car then available. It benefited from decades of Renault experience with front-wheel-drive, and a good example will still impress even today."<ref>[http://www.automobear.com/PDFs/AutomoBear%20-%20The%20Chrysler-AMC-Renault%20story.pdf  "The Chrysler-AMC-Renault story", AutomoBear.com, 2003-09-01], retrieved on 2009-08-02.</ref> The engineering levels achieved in the Premier are arguably the most refined in a sedan that was then produced by AMC or Chrysler. 

The original projections were to have annual production of 150,000 Premiers.<ref name=Magna>{{cite book | last = Lilley | first =  Wayne | title = Magna Cum Laude: How Frank Stronach Became Canada's Best-Paid Man | publisher = McClelland & Stewart Ltd. | year = 2008  | pages = 132<U+2013>133 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=kT1MIYLoTmIC&pg=PA132&dq=Eagle+Premier%E2%80%8E&ei=fJNCS7PpPKLeygSXyNm6CQ&client=safari&cd=3#v=onepage&q=Eagle%20Premier%E2%80%8E&f=false | isbn = 9780771046384 }}</ref> [[Magna International]] had signed a contract in 1986 to supply body panels for the Premiers. As a result, the automotive supplier received $10 million grants from the governments of both [[Government of Canada|Canada]] and [[Government of Ontario|Ontario]] to expanded the metal stamping plant in [[Milton, Ontario]].<ref name=Magna/> However, the Premier did not achieve its sales targets. 

Critics have argued that Chrysler did not properly market the Premier, having confused its intended market. ES models were compared directly with the [[Audi 80]], [[Acura Legend]], and similar <U+2018>import<U+2019> sedans, while LX models were aimed at a lower tier market competing against the [[Ford Taurus]] and [[GM A platform (FWD)|GM A-platform]] cars ([[Buick Century]], [[Chevrolet Celebrity]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]]). Chrysler also ended up with six different brands after the purchase of AMC, just one less than GM, which was four times as large automaker.<ref name=fallrise>{{Cite book | last = Ingrassia | first = Paul | last2 = White | first2 = Joseph B. | title = Comeback: The Fall & Rise of the American Automobile Industry | publisher =  Simon and Schuster | year = 1995 | pages = 192<U+2013>193 | url =  http://books.google.com/books?id=Q5QfVZuQs9UC&pg=PA191&dq=Eagle+Premier&lr=&ei=-TA0S4DWDaK4yQSFtOysAQ&client=safari&cd=30#v=onepage&q=Eagle%20Premier&f=false | isbn = 9780684804378 }}</ref> Not only could Chrysler not afford to properly promote and advertise each of its brands, it also faced the legacy of failure by French cars in the United States.<ref name=fallrise/> Of the Premier and [[Renault Medallion]] (based on the Renault 21 sold overseas), Bob Lutz, then a Vice President at Chrysler, said they were <U+201C>unsellable<U+201D>.

The Premier carried many vestiges of AMC and Renault's engineering long after Chrysler acquired the car's design. For example, the [[vehicle identification number]] for the entire 1988 model year production retained AMC format.<ref>[http://www.mitchellsupport.com/ondemand5/VIN/VIN.pdf Mitchell VIN Decoding, AMC/JEEP, pages g13-g17]. Retrieved on 2009-12-24.</ref> The AMC logo was featured on many of the car's components through to the end of production.

The introduction of a rebadged model named [[Dodge Monaco]] resulted from a contractual obligation to use 260,000 of the PRV engines over five years, a clause in the AMC buyout from Renault. The Monaco sold poorly, and both it and the Premier were cancelled in 1992. There was little marketing support for the Premier by the [[Jeep-Eagle]] dealers themselves because they were focused on selling the highly successful and more profitable [[Jeep]] models. Furthermore, the decision to eventually combine Jeep-Eagle with [[Chrysler-Plymouth]] dealers called for the long-term corporate goal of phasing out the Eagle brand. There were 139,051 Premiers and Monacos built at Bramalea. Chrysler paid a penalty for every car not produced and V6 engine not purchased from Renault.<ref name=fallrise/>

These cars offered features that were considered quite advanced for their time. However, as a result, many vehicles have suffered from electrical problems, having proven to be one of the cars' bigger drawbacks over time. It was also chastised for various mechanical problems, particularly unreliability of the transmissions and frequent overheating of the V6 engine. Despite this, they are still seen as being a car that was on the cutting edge of design and features.

A new, highly advanced<ref name=sweat/> factory (called Bramalea Assembly) was built to manufacture the Premier at Bramalea, near an existing AMC plant in [[Brampton, Ontario, Canada]]. This state of the art plant was opened in 1986 and was one of AMC's assets that interested Chrysler. It was renamed [[Brampton Assembly]] after the buyout. Brampton Assembly was retooled for the production of the [[Chrysler LH platform|Chrysler LH-cars]] that debuted in autumn of 1992, including the Premier's replacement, the [[Eagle Vision|Vision]], and the Vision's sister vehicles, the [[Dodge Intrepid]] and the [[Chrysler Concorde]].

The Premier inspired many of the LH platform<U+2019>s design features. [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Castaing]], formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988, and as a result, the Premier was the starting point for Chrysler's new LH sedans. Although the [[cab forward]] styling was quite different, the engines in the LH cars were mounted [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally]], like the Premier. This was "a hallmark of [[Renault]]'s front-wheel-drive designs" and unlike any other car built by Chrysler to that time.<ref>[http://cars.about.com/od/detoursanddiversions/ig/American-branded-Eurocars/Renault-25.htm Gold, Aaron. "Eagle Premier/Dodge Monaco: American-branded Eurocars" About.com Cars], retrieved on 2009-08-02.</ref> The LH platform's dedicated transmission, the A606, was also quite similar in design to the  electronically-controlled automatic featured in four-cylinder Premiers. The Premier's body shell was used for LH prototype [[development mule]]s, under which the LH drivetrain was tested.<ref>[http://www.allpar.com/model/lh2/ "1993-1997 Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker, and LHS", allpar.com], retrieved on 2009-08-02.</ref>

Although only a four-door sedan, the Premier could be a "future classic" according to  automotive journalist, Dan Roth, as "one of the best American cars of the last 20 years, able to hold its own against luxury European marques, and being a caretaker of the last AMC car (Jeeps aren't cars!) would be a responsibility we'd relish."<ref name=roth/>
