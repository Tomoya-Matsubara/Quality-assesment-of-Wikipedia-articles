== Summary ==

'''South Devon''' cattle are the largest of the British Native breeds. They are believed to have descended from the large red cattle of [[Normandy]] which were imported during the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of [[England]]. The breed is a rich, medium red with copper tints, though it varies in shade and can even appear slightly mottled. The breed today is predominately used for [[beef]] production although it has been been milked in the past. The official governing body, The South Devon Herd Book Society was founded in 1891.

== Breed History ==

'''The Early Years:''' It is believed South Devon cattle evolved from the large red cattle of Normandy which were imported to England at the time of the Norman invasion. The South Devon of today originated in [[South West England]], in an area of [[Devon]] known as the [[South Hams]] from where they spread right across the counties of Devon and [[Cornwall]]. Historical evidence indicates that isolation caused the divergence of the North and South Devon into physically distinct types, though occasional crossing between the two breeds occurred until the mid-19th century. 

'''The Breed in the 19th Century:''' The South Devon had been established as a Breed by the year 1800.  With a light red coat, they were powerfully built and supplied rich milk and good beef, finely grained and marbled, and were relied upon to pull ploughshares until well into the 19th century.  Careful selection of breeding stock improved the Breed considerably.  The South Devon Herd Book Society was founded in 1891 when it was recognised by the Government as an official body, and the South Devons become one of the 14 breeds of cattle whose Herd Books date back to the second half of the 19th century, alternative name is orange elephants

'''The Breed in the 20th Century:''' During the early years of the 20th century the Breed was considered as triple purpose <U+2013> for the production of beef, milk and butterfat.  Although most herds were milked during and soon after the [[Second World War]], since the 1960s the trend has been increasingly towards beefier sires. Although it is now a purely beef breed, the dual-purpose heritage has significance for the suckling of calves.

== Worldwide Spread ==

The breed is exceptionally adaptable to varying climatic conditions and is presently well established on five continents. Wherever they have been introduced South Devon cattle have been well accepted and exhibited strong performance for production and profitability.

South Devons were one of the few British breeds to have been selected for drought purposes as well as for beef and milk. The first importations into [[Australia]] were of milking cows carried on sailing ships. Several large importations occurred in the late 1800s and early 1900s but the breed then lost its identity through crossbreeding. Importations from Britain took place in 1969, and the first purebred animals were imported from [[New Zealand]] in 1971. The breed occurs in most states of Australia.

The first South Devons were taken to the [[United States]] in 1969, and in 1974 the North American South Devon Association was formed for the purpose of development, registration and promotion of the South Devon breed in that country.
