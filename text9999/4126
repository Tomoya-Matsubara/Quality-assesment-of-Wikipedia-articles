==Biography==
===Career===
Salman Khan made his acting debut in the 1988 film ''[[Biwi Ho To Aisi]]'' where he played a supporting role. His first leading role in a [[Bollywood]] movie was in [[Sooraj R. Barjatya]]'s romance ''[[Maine Pyar Kiya]]'' (1989). The film went on to become one of India's highest grossing films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/alltime.htm|title=boxofficeindia.com/alltime.htm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> It also won him a [[Filmfare Best Male Debut Award]], and a nomination for [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]].

1990 saw only one film release starring Khan, ''[[Baaghi]]'', co-starring alongside southern actress [[Nagma]]. The film was a box office success,<ref>[http://www.boxofficeindia.com/1990.htm 1990 box office results]. BoxOfficeIndia.com.</ref> and was followed by another successful year in 1991 when he starred in three hit films, ''[[Patthar Ke Phool]]'', ''[[Sanam Bewafa]]'' and ''[[Saajan]]''.<ref name="Salman's filmo">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/salmankhan.htm|title=Salman Khan's box office filmography|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref> Despite these tremendous early box office successes, all of his 1992-1993 releases resulted in box office failures.<ref name="Salman's filmo"/>

Khan clawed back his previous success in 1994 with his second collaboration with director Sooraj Barjatya in the romance ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun]]'', co-starring [[Madhuri Dixit]]. The film was the biggest hit of that year, and turned out to be one of Bollywood's highest grossing films ever, beciming the fourth highest earner of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/alltime.htm|title=All Time Grossers Inflation Adjusted|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> Apart from being a commercial success, the film was widely acclaimed and Khan was praised for his performance, earning his second nomination for ''Best Actor'' at the [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]]. Three more films released that year featured Khan, none of which making a significant impact on the box-office as was the case with the previously mentioned title. He did however win praise for his performance in ''[[Andaz Apna Apna]]'', alongside co-star [[Aamir Khan]], which has gained a cult status since its release. In 1995 he cemented his success with [[Rakesh Roshan]]'s blockbuster ''[[Karan Arjun]]'', co-starring alongside [[Shahrukh Khan]].<ref name="Salman's filmo"/> The film was the second biggest hit of the year, and his role of Karan once again put his name among the nominees for the ''Best Actor'' award at the Filmfare, which was eventually won by his ''Karan Arjun'' co-star Shahrukh Khan.

1996 was followed by two successes. The first one being [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s directional debut ''[[Khamoshi: The Musical]]'', co-starring [[Manisha Koirala]], [[Nana Patekar]] and [[Seema Biswas]]. Though a box office failure, the film was critically acclaimed. He next starred alongside [[Sunny Deol]] and [[Karisma Kapoor]] in [[Raj Kanwar]]'s action hit ''[[Jeet (1996 film)|Jeet]]''.

He had only two releases in 1997: ''[[Judwaa]]'' and ''[[Auzaar]]''. The former was a comedy directed by [[David Dhawan]] co-starring [[Karisma Kapoor]], where he played a dual role of twins separated at birth. The film was a box office hit. The latter, co-starring [[Shilpa Shetty]] failed to do well, but developed a cult following after its video release. 

Khan worked in five different films in 1998, his first release being the comedy ''[[Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya (1998 film)|Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya]]'' opposite [[Kajol]], one of the biggest commercial successes of that year. This was followed by the moderately successful drama ''[[Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai]]''.<ref name="Salman's filmo"/> Khan played a young man who has to take a child who claims to be his son, under his custody. Khan's performance in the film earned him several positive notices and favourable reviews from critics. He rounded of the year with [[Karan Johar]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]''. Co-starring alongside [[Shahrukh Khan]] and Kajol, he had only an extended cameo playing the role of Aman. However, it eventually turned out beneficial to him, as his performance earned him his second [[Filmfare Award]] under the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award|Best Supporting Actor]] category.

In 1999, Khan starred in three hit films: ''[[Hum Saath-Saath Hain: We Stand United]]'', which reunited him with Sooraj Barjatya for the third time; ''[[Biwi No.1]]'', which became the top grossing film that year; and ''[[Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam]]'', which was a major critical success, and earned him another Best Actor nomination at the Filmfare. In 2000, Khan acted in six films, most of which failed critically and commercially, except for the two moderately successful films, ''[[Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega]]'' and ''[[Chori Chori Chupke Chupke]]'', both of which co-starred [[Rani Mukerji]] and [[Preity Zinta]]. His performance in ''Chori Chori Chupke Chupke'', the release of which was delayed until 2001, was received well. The film was one of the first Bollywood movies to handle the issue of [[Surrogate mother|surrogate childbirth]]; Khan played the role of a rich industrialist, who hires a surrogate mother after his wife becomes infertile. Critics noted his turn towards a more serious role, which reportedly had more substance in comparison to his previous roles.<ref>{{cite web|author=Adarsh, Taran|title=Chori Chori Chupke Chupke: Movie Review|date=March 8, 2001|url=http://www.indiafm.com/movies/review/6728/index.html|publisher=Indiafm.com|accessmonthday=January 25 |accessyear=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Us Salam, Ziya|title=Film review: Chori Chori Chupke Chupke|date=[[March 16]], [[2001]]|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/03/16/stories/09160223.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref> In 2002 he starred in the delayed release ''[[Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam]]'' which was semi-hit at the box office. 

Khan's following releases failed at the box office until he made a comeback in 2003 with ''[[Tere Naam]]''. The film was a major earner and his performance was praised by critics, with film critic [[Taran Adarsh]] noting, "Salman Khan is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid..."<ref>{{cite web|author=Adarsh, Taran|url=http://indiafm.com/movies/review/7078/index.html|title=Tere Naam|publisher=[[indiaFM]]|date=[[August 15]] [[2003]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> He subsequently continued his success at the box office, with comedies like ''[[Mujhse Shaadi Karogi]]'' (2004) and ''[[No Entry]]'' ''(2005)''.<ref name="Salman's filmo"/> 2006 was an unsuccessful year for him when ''[[Jaan-E-Mann]]'' and ''[[Baabul]]'' both failed to do well at the box office.

Khan started 2007 with the ensemble film ''[[Salaam E Ishq]]'' which failed to do well at the box office. His next release ''[[Partner (2007 film)|Partner]]'' did very well at the box office, receiving a blockbuster verdict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/topgrossersbyyear.asp?year=2007|title=Box Office Results Top Grosses by Decades and Years - 2007|publisher=International Business Overview Standard|accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref> He next appeared in his first [[Hollywood]] movie, ''[[Marigold: An Adventure in India]]'' opposite American actress [[Ali Larter]]. Telling the love story of an Indian man and an American woman, the film was a major failure, both commercially and critically.

===Personal life===
Khan is the eldest son of celebrated screenwriter [[Salim Khan]] and his first wife Salma Khan. His stepmother is [[Helen (actress)|Helen]], a famous yesteryear Bollywood actress, who has co-starred with him in ''[[Khamoshi: The Musical]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam]]'' (1999). He has two brothers, [[Arbaaz Khan]] and [[Sohail Khan]], and two sisters, Alvira and Arpita. Alvira is married to actor/director [[Atul Agnihotri]].

Khan is a dedicated bodybuilder. He trains everyday and is famous for taking off his shirt in movies and stage shows alike. In 2004, he was voted 7th best-looking man in the World and the best looking man in India by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, [[United states|U.S]].<ref name=www.indiantelevision.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/tube/y2k4/mar/martube17.htm|title="'Masand ki Pasand' is Salman Khan this time"|Indian television|date=[[March 25]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> Khan has been involved in several charities during his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/salman-still-dares-to-bare-at-40/2843-8.html|title=Salman still dares to 'bare' at 40|date=[[December 27]], [[2005]]|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>

Despite being romantically linked with several actresses, and having relationships with ex-girlfriends [[Aishwarya Rai]], [[Somy Ali]] and [[Sangeeta Bijlani]], Khan is frequently featured by Indian media as Bollywood's most eligible bachelor. He has been dating model-turned-actress [[Katrina Kaif]] since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|author=Menon, Sita|title=Katrina's beautiful, and she knows it|publisher=|Rediff.com|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jul/22katrina.htm|date=[[July 21]],[[2003]]|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref>

On [[October 11]] [[2007]], Khan accepted an offer from [[Madame Tussauds]] wax museum in [[London]] to have a wax replica made of himself. His life-size wax figure was finally installed there on [[January 15]] [[2008]], making him the fourth Indian actor to have been replicated as a wax statue in the museum.<ref>{{cite web|author=Indo-Asian News Service

==Controversies==
===Legal troubles===
On [[September 28]], [[2002]], Salman was arrested for rash and negligent driving. His car had collided into a bakery in Mumbai; one person who was sleeping on the sidewalk outside the bakery died and three others were injured in the mishap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/sep/28khan.htm|title="Salman Khan's jeep runs over pavement dwellers, one dead; actor surrenders"|Rediff.com|[[September 28]] [[2002]]}}</ref> Charges of culpable homicide were laid against him, but later dropped, and he was found not guilty.

On [[February 17]], [[2006]], Khan was sentenced to one year in prison for hunting an endangered species, the [[Chinkara]]. The sentence was stayed by a higher court during appeal.<ref name=yahoonewsindia>{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/060217/139/62k5x.html|title="Salman Khan sentenced to one-year imprisonment in poaching case"|publisher=Asian News International (ANI) via [[Yahoo! News]] India|date=[[February 17]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-06-28}}</ref>
On [[April 10]], [[2006]], Salman was handed a five year [[jail]] term for hunting the endangered Chinkara. He was remanded to [[Jodhpur]] jail, and remained there until April 13, when he was granted bail.<ref name=sify>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/movies/bollywood/fullstory.php?id=14184053|title="Salman granted bail on poaching case"|publisher=[[Sify|sify.com]]|date=[[13 April]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-06-28}}</ref>
On [[August 24]], [[2007]], the Jodhpur sessions court, upheld the 5 year jail term for Khan in the Chinkara poaching case by turning down his appeal against the 2006 judgement. At the time of the hearing, he was busy with a shooting elsewhere, while his sister attended the proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/jodhpur-court-upholds-salmans-5year-jail-term/47375-3.html|title=www.ibnlive.com/news/jodhpur-court-upholds-salmans-5year-jail-term/47375-3.html<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> Day after, he was placed under police arrest in Jodhpur after a [[Rajasthan]] court upheld a prison sentence passed upon him for poaching. On [[August 31]], [[2007]], Khan was released on bail from the Jodhpur Central jail where he has spent six days.

===Relationship troubles===
His turbulent relationship with actress [[Aishwarya Rai]] was a well publicised topic in the Indian media, and had constantly filled gossip columns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020303/spectrum/main6.htm|title="Salman in news for the wrong reasons"|Tribune of India|[[March 3]] [[2002]]}}</ref> After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/23402266.cms|title="Salman harassing me, says Aishwarya"|publisher=The Times of India|[[September 27]] [[2002]]}}</ref>

In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened his ex-girlfriend, Aishwarya Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to [[organized crime]] and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the [[Indian Government|government's]] Forensic lab in [[Chandigarh]], which concluded that it was a fake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050718/nation.htm#1|title="Police records Salman Khan's voice, Ash keeps mum"|The Tribune|date=[[July 18]] [[2005]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/09/17/int6.htm|title="Salman cleared in Aishwarya tape case"|Associated Press|date=[[September 16]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref>
