==Early life==
[[Image:Alvaro Uribe and Bill Gates.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[<U+00C1>lvaro Uribe]] (the president of Colombia) and Bill Gates]]
William Henry Gates III was born in [[Seattle, Washington]] to [[William H. Gates, Sr.|William H. Gates, Jr.]] (now ''Sr.'') and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]]. His family was wealthy; his father was a prominent lawyer, his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate Bank and the [[United Way of America|United Way]], and her father, J. W. Maxwell, was a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or "[[Trey]]" because his father had dropped his own "III" suffix.<ref name="gatesmogul">{{cite book|

Gates excelled in elementary school, particularly in [[mathematics]] and the [[science]]s.  At thirteen he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School]], Seattle's most exclusive preparatory school where tuition in 1967 was $5,000 (Harvard tuition that year was $1,760). When he was in the eighth grade, the school mothers used proceeds from a [[rummage sale]] to buy Lakeside an [[ASR-33]] [[teletype]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] computer.<ref name="gatesmogul"/> Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on other systems, including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] [[minicomputer]]s. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation, which banned the Lakeside students for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the [[operating system]] to obtain free computer time.

At the end of the ban, the Lakeside students (Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans) offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for free computer time. Rather than use the system via teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, not only in BASIC but [[FORTRAN]], [[LISP]], and [[machine language]] as well. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when it went out of business. The following year Information Sciences Inc. hired the Lakeside students to write a [[payroll]] program in [[COBOL]], providing them not only computer time but [[royalties]] as well. At age 14, Gates also formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor. That first year he made $20,000, however when his age was discovered business slowed.<ref>{{Cite interview|

As a youth, Bill Gates was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout.

According to a press inquiry, Bill Gates stated that he scored 1590 on his [[SAT]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 | title=The new<U+2014>and improved?<U+2014>SAT | accessdate=2006-05-23 | publisher=The Week Magazine}}</ref>

After reading the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], Gates contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.<ref name="keyevents">{{cite web | title=Key Events In Microsoft History | url=http://www.microsoft.com/visitorcenter/student.mspx | accessdate=1 October|accessyear=2005 }} ([[DOC]] format) </ref> In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[H. Edward Roberts|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]].  Paul Allen hired into MITS,<ref name=thocp1>

</ref>
and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS, dubbing their [[partnership]] "Micro-soft" in November 1975.<ref name=thocp1/> Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on [[November 26]], [[1976]], the tradename "Microsoft" was registered with the [[USPTO]].<ref name=thocp1/>

Microsoft's BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter saying that MITS could not continue to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment.<ref>[http://www.blinkenlights.com/classiccmp/gateswhine.html Bill Gates, ''An Open Letter to Hobbyists, [[February 3]] [[1976]]]</ref> This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.

According to Gates, people at Microsoft often did more than one job during the early years; whoever answered the phone when an order came in was responsible for packing and mailing it. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.<ref name="waterloo">{{cite speech|

In [[1980]] [[IBM]] approached Microsoft to make the BASIC interpreter for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]]. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an [[operating system]], Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.<ref>{{cite web|

IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later Gates proposed using [[QDOS|86-DOS (QDOS)]], an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Seattle Computer Products]] had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS, but did not mention that IBM was a potential customer. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[PC-DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee.<ref>{{cite web|
url=http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MSDOS-PCDOS.htm|
title=MS DOS and PC DOS|
work=Lexikon's History of Computing|
accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref> Gates never understood why DRI had walked away from the deal, and in later years he claimed that DRI founder [[Gary Kildall]] capriciously "went flying" during an IBM appointment, a characterization that Kildall and other DRI employees would deny.

As several companies reverse-engineered the IBM architecture and developed [[Pc clone|clones]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/r0304/09r04/09r04.asp&guid=|title=Booting Your PC: Getting Up Close & Personal With A Computer<U+2019>s BIOS|publisher=Smart Computing|date=November 1999|accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> Microsoft was quick to license DOS to other manufacturers, calling it [[MS-DOS]] (for Microsoft [[Floppy disk|Disk]] [[Operating System]]). By marketing MS-DOS aggressively to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones, Microsoft went from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. Microsoft continued to develop operating systems as well as [[software applications]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/1994/june94/pcn0608/pcn0608.asp&articleid=5103&guid=|title=When It Comes To DOS, You Now Have A Choice|publisher=Smart Computing|date=June 1994|accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/r0603/09r03/09r03.asp|title=Microsoft to Microsoft disk operating system (MS-DOS)|publisher=Smart Computing|date=March 2002|accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref>

===Windows===
{{see also|History of Microsoft Windows}}
[[Image:Gates kapor gibbons.jpg|thumb|Bill Gates, [[Mitch Kapor]], and Fred Gibbons representing [[Macintosh]] software vendors in [[1984]].]]
In the early 1980s Microsoft introduced its own version of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), based on ideas pioneered by the [[Xerox]] corporation, and further developed by Apple.<ref>Opinion, ''Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation''. U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 1994.</ref> Microsoft released "[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]" as an addition and alternative to their DOS command line, and to compete with other systems on the market that employed a GUI. By the early 1990s, Windows had pushed other DOS-based GUIs like [[Graphical Environment Manager|GEM]] and [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]] out of the market. The release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990 was a tremendous success, selling around 10 million copies in the first two years and cementing Microsoft's dominance in operating systems sales.<ref>http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/vpc/win.html</ref>

By continuing to ensure, by various means, that most computers came with Microsoft software pre-installed, the Microsoft corporation eventually became the largest software company in the world, earning Gates enough money that ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'' named him the wealthiest person in the world for several years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/259066.stm|title=The software superpower|date=[[2000-01-14]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2006-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3685412.stm|title=Bill Gates tops Forbes rich list|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2004-09-24]]|accessdate=2006-09-05}}</ref> Gates served as the [[CEO]] of the company until 2000, when [[Steve Ballmer]] took the position.<ref name="keyevents" /> Microsoft has thousands of patents,<ref>

===Strategy and management===
[[Image:Billgates.JPG|thumb|right|Bill Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on [[August 27]] [[1998]]]]
Since Microsoft's founding in 1975 and as of 2006, Gates has had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy. He has aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever Microsoft has achieved a dominant position he has vigorously defended it. Many decisions that have led to [[antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's [[business practices]] have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the definitions of words such as: ''compete'', ''concerned'', ''ask'', and ''we''.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html CNN, ''Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court'', [[November 17]] [[1998]]]</ref> ''BusinessWeek'' reported:
{{quotation|Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail Gates both sent and received.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm BusinessWeek, ''Microsoft's Teflon Bill'', 11/30/98]</ref>}} 

Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said "Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."<ref>{{cite journal|

Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, blocking competition, in violation of the [[Sherman Act]].

As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Most firsthand accounts of these meetings portray him as hostile, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategy or proposals that place the company's long-term interests at risk.<ref name="playboy"/><ref>{{cite web|

Gates' role at Microsoft for most of its history has been primarily a management and executive role. However, he was an active software developer in the early years, particularly on the company's [[programming language]] products. (See also: [[DONKEY.BAS]]) He has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100 line]], but he wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products.<ref name="pdc97"/> On [[June 15]], [[2006]], Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors, placing [[Ray Ozzie]] in charge of day-to-day management and [[Craig Mundie]] in charge of long-term product strategy.<ref>{{cite news

Since 2000 the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the [[dot-com bubble]] and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In May 2006, Gates said in an interview that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world, stating that he disliked the attention it brought.<ref>{{cite news|

===Philanthropy===
[[Image:Bill Gates in Poland.jpg|thumb|Gates in [[Poland]], 2006]]

In 2000, Gates founded the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], a charitable organization, with his wife. Bill Gates Sr. has credited [[David Rockefeller]]'s generosity and extensive philanthropy as an influence on his son. The two of them met several times with him and have modeled their giving in part on the [[Rockefeller family]]'s philanthropic focus on global problems being ignored by governments and other organizations.[http://www.rbf.org/2005%20Annual%20Report/Chronicle%20of%20Philanthropy.pdf]

The foundation's grants have provided funds for college [[scholarships]] for under-represented minorities, [[AIDS]] prevention, diseases prevalent in [[third world]] countries, and other causes. In 2000, the Gates Foundation endowed the [[University of Cambridge]] with $210 million for the [[Gates Cambridge Scholarships]]. The Foundation has also pledged over $7 billion to its various causes, including $1 billion to the [[United Negro College Fund]]. According to a 2004 ''Forbes'' magazine article, Gates gave away over $29 billion to charities from 2000 onwards. These donations are usually cited as sparking a substantial change in attitudes towards [[philanthropy]] among the very rich, with philanthropy becoming the norm.<ref>A [[25 February]], [[2006]] survey of [[philanthropy]] by ''The Economist'' noted, "The media, which used to take little notice of charitable donations, now eagerly rank the super-rich by their munificence..."</ref>

===Public school support===
One of Gates' primary interests is improving the public schools. He has donated substantially toward that goal, and also appeared on programs with personalities such as Oprah Winfrey to emphasize the crisis in American education.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} He has also appeared before Congress for this purpose.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

===Transition===
On [[June 16]], [[2006]], Gates announced that he would move to a part-time role within Microsoft (leaving day-to-day operations management)<ref>Microsoft: "Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates" webpage: [http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx].</ref> in July 2008 to begin a full-time career in [[philanthropy]], but would remain as [[chairman]]. Gates credited [[Warren Buffett]] with influencing his decision to commit himself to charitable causes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Warren Buffett Gives Away his Fortune | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/25/magazines/fortune/charity1.fortune/index.htm |work=Fortune |date=2006-06-25 |author=Carol J. Loomis |accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> Days later, Buffett announced that he would begin matching Gates' contributions to the Gates Foundation, up to $1.5 billion per year in stock.<ref>NPR: "Buffett Gift Sends $31 Billion to Gates Foundation," NPR ''All Things Considered'', 26-June-2006, webpage: [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5512893 NPR-Buffett].</ref>
