[[Casting Crowns]]' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, commented on the lyrical content of the song, stating that: "For believers, in context with our other songs, the messages are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants you to have a purpose".<ref name="Behind the Song with Kevin Davis">{{cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/article.php?article_id=342|title=Behind the Song with Kevin Davis #103 - "Until the Whole World Hears"|last=Davis|first=Kevin|date=6 April 2010|publisher=New Release Tuesday|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> Hall elaborated that: "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on [[Until the Whole World Hears|the album]].

This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life".<ref name="Mark on Until the Whole World Hears">{{cite web|url=https://castingcrowns.com/content/mark-until-whole-world-hears|title=Mark on "Until the Whole World Hears"|date=8 April 2010|publisher=Casting Crowns.com|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> He elaborated on that, commenting that: "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".<ref name="Mark on Until the Whole World Hears" />
