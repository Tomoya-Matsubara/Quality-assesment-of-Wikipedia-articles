==Reception==
Jean-Yves Duperron of the Classical Music Sentinel appreciated the continuity of the subject matter and compared the album to a three-movement symphony.<ref name=Duperron>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicalmusicsentinel.com/collections/collection-lovers.html|title=Collection <U+2013> Tragic Lovers <U+2013> James DePreist (Conductor) <U+2013> Oregon Symphony Orchestra <U+2013> Delos DE3369|accessdate=March 28, 2013|first=Jean-Yves|last=Duperron|publisher=Classical Music Sentinel}}</ref> Referring to the opener as the first movement of this hypothetical symphony, Duperron wrote that Wagner's composition "works perfectly" by setting the tone for the album. He appreciated the Berlioz composition as a "central movement" for its more "pleasant" mood and lighter musical textures, and Tchaikovsky's work as the finale for its dramatic and "tumultuous" qualities.<ref name=Duperron/> Duperron complimented DePreist and the orchestra for conveying the emotions depicted in each of the compositions "loud and clear", and specifically highlighted the "massive walls of sound" produced by the strings. He also commended Delos for effectively capturing the performances "with clean and powerful dynamics throughout" and concluded the review by quipping: "This perfectly coordinated collection should be part of every collection!"<ref name=Duperron/>
