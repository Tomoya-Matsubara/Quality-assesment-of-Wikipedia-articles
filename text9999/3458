{{1917 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''1917 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[1917 college football season]].  In his 17th year as head coach, [[Fielding H. Yost]] led the [[Michigan Wolverines football]] team to an 8<U+2013>2 record, as Michigan outscored its opponents by a combined score of 304 to 53.<ref name=t17>{{cite web|title=1917 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|accessdate=May 1, 2015|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1917fbt.htm}}</ref> Michigan won its first eight games and outscored those opponents by a combined score of 292 to 16.  The team then lost its final two games against [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]] and [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]].

With the United States entry into [[World War I]] in April 1917, Michigan's male student body dropped by 30%, and Michigan lost many of its starters to military service.  The players lost to the military included fullback [[Cedric C. Smith|Cedric "Pat" Smith]], who had been elected to serve as captain of the 1917 team. With only one returning backfield player, coach Yost converted tackle [[Elton Wieman]] into a fullback.  Wieman became the team's leading scorer in 1917 with 129 points on 14 [[touchdown]]s, 36 points after touchdown (PAT), and three [[field goal]]s. After an injury to starting [[quarterback]] [[Cliff Sparks]] in the second game, [[Archie Weston]] took over and became the team's second leading scorer with 78 points on 13 touchdowns.

==Season summary==

===Pre-season===
On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war on the [[German Empire]], marking its entry into [[World War I]]. In early August 1917, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) met with representatives of more than 125 colleges and universities to determine whether or not to proceed with intercollegiate athletics during the war. Secretary of War [[Newton D. Baker]] addressed the gathering, opined that intercollegiate athletics were an effective means of training for military service, and recommended that efforts be undertaken to expand the number of persons receiving this training. The gathering then passed a resolution providing for the continuation of intercollegiate athletics with an emphasis on carrying out the recommendations of the Secretary of War.<ref>{{cite news|title=Athletics A Training For Arms|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=October 1917|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vk9YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

As students enlisted in large numbers for military service, the enrollment of male students at the University of Michigan dropped by thirty percent (30%) in the fall of 1917.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 1917 Football Team|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=November 1917|page=70|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vk9YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  Several of Michigan veteran players (including [[Cedric C. Smith|Cedric "Pat" Smith]], Philip Raymond, Willard Peach, John West, J. Vinton Hammels, and Frank Willard) were unavailable to the team due to military service. The losses left the team with only six players ([[Cliff Sparks]], [[Elton Wieman]], Richard Weske, Alan Boyd, Joseph Hanish, and John Orton Goodsell) who had ever played on the first team.  With only one returning backfield player (Sparks), Yost converted tackle [[Elton Wieman]] into a fullback.<ref>{{cite news|title=Prospects for the Team|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=October 1917|page=51|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vk9YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>
