{{main|History of Japan}}
The first signs of [[civilization]] on the [[Japanese Archipelago]] appeared around [[10th millennium BC|10,000&nbsp;BCE]] with the [[Jomon]] culture, characterized by a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle of pit dwelling and a rudimentary form of [[agriculture]]. Decorated clay vessels from this period, often with plaited patterns, are some of the oldest surviving examples of [[pottery]] in the world.<ref>Pottery in Japan:
*"The earliest known pottery comes from Japan, and is dated to about 10,500&nbsp;BCE. China and Indo-China follow shortly afterwards." ((1995). "Past Worlds". ''The Times Atlas of Archeology''. p. 100.)
*"That end of the Ice Age was accompanied by the first of the two most decisive changes in Japanese history: the invention of pottery. In the usual experience of archaeologists, inventions flow from mainlands to islands, and small peripheral societies aren't supposed to contribute revolutionary advances to the rest of the world. It therefore astonished archaeologists to discover that the world's oldest known pottery was made in Japan 12,700 years ago." Diamond, Jared (June 1998), "Japanese Roots", ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' '''19''' (6).
*"Japan, however, was the seat of the earliest known development of ceramics." ([[Cavalli-Sforza]]. ''The History and Geography of Human Genes''. p. 249. [[ISBN]] 0-691-08750-4.) 
*Alternatively, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/splash.htm Timeline of Art History] notes "Carbon-14 testing of the earliest known shards has yielded a production date of about 10,500&nbsp;BCE, but because this date falls outside the known chronology of pottery development elsewhere in the world, such an early date is not generally accepted."[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/02/eaj/ht02eaj.htm "Japan, 8000<U+2013>2000 BCE."] Timeline of Art History.

The [[Yayoi period]], starting around the third century&nbsp;BC, introduced new practices, such as wet-rice farming, [[iron]] and [[bronze]]-making and a new style of pottery, brought by migrants from [[China]] or [[Korea]]. With the development of Yayoi culture, a predominantly agricultural society emerged in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-23121 |title=The Yayoi period (c.250&nbsp;BC-c.AD&nbsp;250) |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |date=2006 | accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Diamond |first= Jared |title= Japanese Roots | journal = Discover Magazine Vol. 19 No. 6 | date =June 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568150_4/Pottery.html#p26 |title=Pottery |publisher=MSN Encarta | accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=De Bary |first=William Theodore |title=Sources of Japanese Tradition |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2005 |pages=1304 | isbn = 023112984X |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN023112984X&id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&pg=RA1-PA1304&lpg=RA1-PA1304&ots=MxkZKlTRlU&dq=%22Chinese+mainland%22+%22Korean+peninsula%22+%22Japanese+archipelago%22&sig=hc4ew2p4cGdppzY6O_b0zWgaB6E#PRA1-PA1304,M1 | accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref>

The Japanese first appear in written history in China<U+2019>s ''[[Book of Han]]''. According to the Chinese ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the third century was called [[Yamataikoku]].

In the sixth century, [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] was introduced to Japan through the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|kingdoms of Korea]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Korean Buddhism Basis of Japanese Buddhism |publisher=The Seoul Times |date=[[2006-06-18]] |url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=580 |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor=Delmer M.

The [[Nara period]] of the eighth century marked the first emergence of a strong central Japanese state, centered around an imperial court in the city of [[Heij<U+014D> Palace|Heij<U+014D>-ky<U+014D>]], or modern day [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. In addition to the continuing adoption of Chinese administrative practices, the [[Nara period]] is characterized by the appearance of a nascent written literature with the completion of the massive chronicles ''[[Kojiki]]'' ([[712]]) and ''[[Nihonshoki]]'' ([[720]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Conrad Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=64-79}}</ref>

In 784, [[Emperor Kammu]] moved the capital to [[Nagaokaky<U+014D>]] for a brief ten-year period, before relocating it to Heian-ky<U+014D> (modern day [[Kyoto]]) in 794, where it remained for more than a millennium.<ref>{{cite book |author=Conrad Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=87-79}}</ref> This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]], during which time a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese poetry|poetry]], and [[Japanese literature|literature]]. [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of modern Japan's national anthem, ''[[Kimi ga Yo]]'' were written during this time.<ref>{{cite book |author=Conrad Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=122-123}}</ref>

Japan's [[feudal]] era was characterized by the emergence of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the rival [[Taira clan]], [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was appointed [[Shogun]] and established a base of power in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, the [[H<U+014D>j<U+014D> clan]] came to rule as regents for the shoguns. [[Zen]] Buddhism was introduced from China in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185&ndash;1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The [[Kamakura shogunate]] managed to repel [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281, aided by a storm that the Japanese interpreted as a [[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]], or Divine Wind. The Kamakura shogunate was eventually overthrown by [[Emperor Go-Daigo]], who was soon himself defeated by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] in 1336.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[George Sansom]] |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334-1615 |publisher=Stanford |pages=42}}</ref> The succeeding [[Ashikaga shogunate]] failed to control the feudal warlords (''[[daimyo]]''), and a civil war erupted (the [[<U+014C>nin War]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=[[George Sansom]] |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334-1615 |publisher=Stanford |pages=217}}</ref> 
 
During the sixteenth century, traders and [[missionary|missionaries]] from [[Portugal]] reached Japan for the first time, initiating the ''[[Nanban trade period|Nanban]]'' ("southern barbarian") period of active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.

[[Oda Nobunaga]] conquered numerous other daimyo by using European technology and [[firearms]] and had almost unified the nation when he was assassinated in 1582. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] succeeded Nobunaga and united the nation in 1590. Hideyoshi [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|invaded Korea twice]], but following several defeats by [[Korea]]n and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Chinese forces and Hideyoshi's death, Japanese troops were withdrawn in 1598.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Stephen Turnbull]] |year=2002 |title=Samurai Invasion: Japan's Korean War |publisher=Cassel |pages=227}}</ref>

After Hideyoshi's death, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] utilized his position as regent for Hideyoshi's son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]] to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. Ieyasu was appointed [[shogun|sh<U+014D>gun]] in 1603 and established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] at [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]). The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] enacted a variety of measures to control the [[daimyo]], among them the ''[[sankin-kotai]]'' policy. In 1639, the shogunate began the isolationist ''[[sakoku]]'' ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]]. The study of Western sciences, known as ''[[rangaku]]'', continued during this period through contacts with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] enclave at [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki]]. The Edo period also gave rise to ''[[kokugaku]]'', or literally "national studies", the study of Japan by the Japanese themselves.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hooker |first=Richard |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/KOKUGAKU.HTM |title=Japan Glossary; Kokugaku | publisher = Washington State University | date=[[1999-07-14]] | accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

On [[March 31]], [[1854]], [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]] and the "[[Black Ships]]" of the [[United States Navy]] forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. The [[Boshin War]] of 1867&ndash;1868 led to the resignation of the shogunate, and the [[Meiji Restoration]] established a government centered around the emperor. Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, a [[parliamentary system]] modeled after the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] was introduced, with [[Ito Hirobumi]] as the first Prime Minister in 1882. [[Meiji era]] reforms transformed the [[Empire of Japan]] into an [[Industrialization|industrialized]] [[world power]] that embarked on a number of military conflicts to increase access to natural resources. After victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894&ndash;1895) and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904&ndash;1905), Japan gained control of [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jearnol2/MeijiRestoration/imperial_japan.htm |title=Japan: The Making of a World Superpower (Imperial Japan) |author=Jesse Arnold | publisher = vt.edu/users/jearnol2 | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

The early twentieth century saw a brief period of "[[Taisho democracy]]" overshadowed by the rise of [[Japanese expansionism]] and [[militarization]]. [[World War I]] enabled Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to expand its influence and territorial holdings. Japan continued its expansionist policy by occupying [[Manchuria]] in 1931. As a result of international condemnation for this occupation, Japan resigned from the [[League of Nations]] two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], joining the [[Axis Powers]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.friesian.com/pearl.htm |title= The Pearl Harbor Strike Force |author= Kelley L.

On [[December 7]], [[1941]], Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States naval base]] in [[Pearl Harbor]] and declared war on the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. This act brought the United States into [[World War II]]. After the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]]s of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] in 1945, along with the Soviet Union joining the war against it, Japan agreed to an [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] on [[August 15]] ([[V-J Day]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.educationworld.net/txt15/surrend1.html |title=Japanese Instrument of Surrender |publisher=educationworld.net |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> The war cost Japan millions of lives and left much of the country's industry and infrastructure destroyed.

In 1947, Japan adopted a new [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] emphasizing [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] practices. Official [[Occupied Japan|American occupation]] lasted until 1952<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070306f3.html |title='52 coup plot bid to rearm Japan: CIA |author=Joseph Coleman| date=[[2006-03-06]]| publisher=[[The Japan Times]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> and Japan was granted membership in the [[United Nations]] in 1956. Under a subsequent program of aggressive industrial development aided by the US, Japan achieved [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|spectacular growth]] to become the second largest economy in the world, with a growth rate averaging 10% for four decades. This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered [[Japanese asset price bubble|a major recession]].

{{main|Politics of Japan}}
Japan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] where the power of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] (<U+5929><U+7687> tenn<U+014D>, literally "heavenly sovereign") is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] as "the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people". Power is held chiefly by the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and other elected members of the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], while sovereignty is vested in the [[Japanese people]].<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web |url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/law/index.htm |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=House of Councillors of the National Diet of Japan |date=[[1946-11-03]] |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> The emperor effectively acts as the [[head of state]] on diplomatic occasions. [[Akihito]] is the current Emperor of Japan.

Japan's legislative organ is the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]], a bicameral [[parliament]]. The Diet consists of a [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]], containing 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and a [[House of Councillors]] of 242 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is [[universal suffrage]] for adults over 20 years of age,<ref name="ciagen"/> with a [[secret ballot]] for all elective offices.<ref name="Constitution"/> The [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) has been in power since 1955, except for a short-lived [[coalition government]] formed from opposition parties in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/english/history/index.html |title=A History of the Liberal Democratic Party |publisher=Liberal Democratic Party of Japan |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> The largest opposition party is the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] [[Democratic Party of Japan]].

The Prime Minister of Japan is the [[head of government]]. The literal translation of his Japanese title is "Prime Minister of the Cabinet". The position is appointed by the [[Emperor of Japan]] after being designated by the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] from among its members, and must enjoy the confidence of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] to remain in office. The Prime Minister is the head of the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] and appoints and dismisses the [[Ministers of State]], a majority of whom must be Diet members. [[Shinzo Abe]] currently serves as the Prime Minister of Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/index-e.html |title=Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Japan| accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> 

Historically influenced by [[Chinese law]], the [[Japanese law|Japanese legal system]] developed independently during the [[Edo period]] through texts such as ''[[Kujikata Osadamegaki]]''. However, since the late nineteenth century, the [[judicial system of Japan|judicial system]] has been largely based on the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[Europe]], notably [[France]] and [[Germany]]. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a [[civil code]] based on the French model. With post-World War II modifications, the code remains in effect in present-day Japan.<ref name="civilcode">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043364?hook=6804 |title="Japanese Civil Code" |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |date=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature, the National Diet of Japan, with the rubber-stamp approval of the Emperor. The current constitution requires that the Emperor promulgates legislation passed by the Diet, without specifically giving him the power to oppose the passing of the legislation.<ref name="Constitution"/> Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] and three levels of lower courts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/judiciary/0620system.html |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Japan |title=The Japanese Judicial System |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> The main body of Japanese statutory law is a collection called the [[Six Codes]].<ref name="civilcode"/>

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Satellite image of Japan in May 2003.jpg|thumb|Japan from space, May 2003.]]
[[Image:Mountfujijapan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Fuji]], the highest point in Japan, with [[sakura]] and the [[Shinkansen|Bullet Train]] in the foreground.]][[Image:OKIBEACH.jpg|thumb|Beach in [[Okinawa Prefecture]].]]
{{main|Geography of Japan}}
Japan is a country of over three thousand islands extending along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of Asia. The main islands, running from north to south, are [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]], [[Honsh<U+016B>]] (the main island), [[Shikoku]], and [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]]. The [[Ryukyu Islands]], including [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], are a chain of islands south of Kyush<U+016B>. Together they are often known as the [[Japanese Archipelago]]. 

About 70% to 80% of the country is forested, mountainous,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566679/Japan.html |title="Japan" |publisher=Microsoft<U+00AE> Encarta<U+00AE> Online Encyclopedia |date=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldinfozone.com/country.php?country=Japan |title=Japan Information - Page 1 |publisher=WorldInfoZone.com |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use. This is due to the generally steep elevations, climate and risk of landslides caused by earthquakes, soft ground and heavy rain. This has resulted in an extremely high population density in the habitable zones that are mainly located in coastal areas. Japan is the thirtieth [[list of countries by population density|most densely populated country]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |title=World Population Prospects |publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> 

Its location on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], at the juncture of three tectonic plates, gives Japan frequent low-intensity tremors and occasional volcanic activity. Destructive [[earthquake]]s, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times each century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/japan_tec.html |title=Tectonics and Volcanoes of Japan |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> The most recent major quakes are the [[2004 Chuetsu Earthquake|2004 Ch<U+016B>etsu Earthquake]] and the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin Earthquake]] of 1995. [[Onsen|Hot springs]] are numerous and have been developed as resorts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/attractions/hotSprings.html |title=Attractions: Hot Springs |publisher=[[JNTO]] |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>

The climate of Japan is predominantly [[temperate]], but varies greatly from north to south.<ref name="climate">{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/essential/climate.html |title=Essential Info: Climate |publisher=[[JNTO]] |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones:
* [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]]: The northernmost zone has a temperate climate with long, cold winters and cool summers. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snow banks in the winter.
* [[Sea of Japan]]: On Honsh<U+016B>'s west coast, the northwest wind in the wintertime brings heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures, due to the [[F<U+00F6>hn wind]] phenomenon.
* [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]]: A typical inland climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night. Precipitation is light.
* [[Inland Sea|Seto Inland Sea]]: The mountains of the [[Ch<U+016B>goku region|Ch<U+016B>goku]] and [[Shikoku]] regions shelter the region from the seasonal winds, bringing mild weather throughout the year.
* [[Pacific Ocean]]: The east coast experiences cold winters with little snowfall and hot, humid summers due to the southeast seasonal wind.
* [[Ryukyu Islands|South-west Islands]]: The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. [[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are common.

The main [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] begins in early May in Okinawa, and the stationary rain front responsible for this gradually works its way north until it dissipates in northern Japan before reaching Hokkaid<U+014D> in late July. In most of Honsh<U+016B>, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, [[typhoon]]s often bring heavy rain.<ref name="climate"/>

Japan is home to nine forest [[Ecoregions of Japan|ecoregions]] which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] in the Ry<U+016B>ky<U+016B> and Bonin islands, to [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to [[temperate coniferous forests]] in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jicc/spotflora.htm |title=Flora and Fauna: Diversity and regional uniqueness |publisher=Embassy of Japan in the USA |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>

The changes in the demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in the workforce population and increases in the cost of social security benefits such as the [[pension|public pension plan]].

Religion in Japan tends to be [[syncretic]] in nature, and this results in a variety of practices, such as parents and children celebrating [[Shinto]] rituals, students praying before exams, couples holding a wedding at a [[Christian]] [[church]] and funerals being held at [[Buddhist]] temples. A minority (0.7%) profess to [[Christianity]].<ref name="ciapeople"/> In addition, since the mid-19th century, numerous religious sects (''[[Shinsh<U+016B>ky<U+014D>]]'') have emerged in Japan.

In Japan, healthcare services are provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/rodwin/lessons.html |author=Victor Rodwin|title=Health Care in Japan |publisher=New York University |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/Jasos/Health.html |title=Health Insurance: General Characteristics |publisher=National Institute of Population and Social Security Research |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

{{main|Culture of Japan}}
Japanese [[culture]] has evolved greatly over the years, from the country's original [[Jomon]] culture to its contemporary hybrid culture, which combines influences from [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Traditional [[Japanese art]]s include [[Japanese crafts|crafts]] ([[ikebana]], [[origami]], [[ukiyo-e]], [[Japanese traditional dolls|dolls]], [[lacquer]]ware, [[Japanese pottery|pottery]]), performances ([[bunraku]], [[Japanese traditional dance|dance]], [[kabuki]], [[noh]], [[rakugo]]), traditions ([[List of Japanese games|games]], [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[budo|bud<U+014D>]], [[Japanese architecture|architecture]], [[Japanese garden|gardens]], [[Katana|swords]]) and [[Cuisine of Japan|cuisine]]. The fusion of traditional [[woodblock printing]] and Western art led to the creation of [[manga]], a typically Japanese [[comic book]] format that is now popular within and outside Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.co.jp/museum/nmp/nmp_i/articles/manga/manga1.html |title= A History of Manga |publisher=NMP International |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> Manga-influenced [[animation]] for television and film is called [[anime]].

[[Music of Japan|Japanese music]] is eclectic, having borrowed instruments, scales, and styles from neighboring cultures. Many instruments, such as the [[koto]], were introduced in the ninth and tenth centuries. The accompanied [[recitative]] of the [[Noh]] drama dates from the fourteenth century and the popular folk music, with the guitar-like [[shamisen]], from the sixteenth.<ref>Japanese Culture, The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia, 1983 edition, <U+00A9> Columbia University Press ISBN 0-380-63396-5</ref> [[Western music]], introduced in the late nineteenth century, now forms an integral part of the culture. Post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European modern music, which has led to the evolution of popular band music called [[J-Pop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1550807,00.html |title= J-Pop History |publisher=[[The Observer]]| accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>

The earliest works of [[Japanese literature]] include two history books the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', and the eighth century poetry book ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'', all written in Chinese characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/~ascj/2000/200015.htm |title= Asian Studies Conference, Japan (2000) |publisher=Meiji Gakuin University |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> In the early days of the [[Heian period]], the system of transcription known as ''kana'' ([[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]]) was created as phonograms. ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'' is considered the oldest Japanese narrative.<ref name="ispmsu">{{cite web |url=http://www.isp.msu.edu/AsianStudies/wbwoa/eastasia/Japan/literature.html |title= Windows on Asia - Literature : Antiquity to Middle Ages: Recent Past |publisher=Michigan State University, Office of International Studies and Programs |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> An account of Heian court life is given by ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' written by [[Sei Sh<U+014D>nagon]], while ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]] is often described as the world's first novel. During the [[Edo Period]], literature became not so much the field of the samurai aristocracy as that of the [[ch<U+014D>nin]], the ordinary people. [[Yomihon]], for example, became popular and reveals this profound change in the readership and authorship.<ref name="ispmsu"/> The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms, during which Japanese literature integrated Western influences. [[Natsume Soseki]] and [[Mori Ogai]] were the first "modern" novelists of Japan, followed by [[Akutagawa Ryunosuke]], [[Tanizaki Junichiro]], [[Kawabata Yasunari]], [[Mishima Yukio]] and, more recently, [[Murakami Haruki]].
