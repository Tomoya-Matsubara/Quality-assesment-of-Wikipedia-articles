'''''Escherichia coli''''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[<U+02CC><U+025B>.<U+0283><U+0259><U+02C8><U+0279><U+026A>.kj<U+0259> <U+02C8>k<U+02B0>o<U+028A>.la<U+026A>]}}) ('''''E. coli'''''), is one of the main species of [[bacteria]] living in the lower [[intestine]]s of [[mammal]]s, known as [[gut flora]]. When located in the large instestine, it actually assists with waste processing, vitamin K production, and food absorption. Discovered in 1885 by [[Theodor Escherich]], a [[Germany|German]] pediatrician and bacteriologist,<ref name="Feng_2002">{{cite web | author = Feng P, Weagant S, Grant, M | title=Enumeration of ''Escherichia coli'' and the Coliform Bacteria | work=Bacteriological Analytical Manual (8th ed.) | publisher = FDA/Center for Food Safety & Applied Nutrition | date = 2002-09-01 | url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~ebam/bam-4.html | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> ''E. coli'' are abundant: the number of individual ''E. coli'' bacteria in the feces that a [[human]] [[Defecation|defecates]] in one day averages between 100 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] and 10 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  However, the bacteria are not confined to this environment, and specimens have also been located, for example, on the edge of [[hot spring]]s.  The ''E. coli'' strain [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]] is one of hundreds of strains of the bacterium that causes illness in humans.<ref name=CDC>{{cite web | title=Escherichia coli O157:H7 | work=CDC Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases | url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/escherichiacoli_g.htm | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref>

As with all [[Gram-negative]] organisms, ''E. coli'' are unable to [[spore|sporulate]]. Thus, treatments which kill all active bacteria, such as [[pasteurization]] or simple boiling, are effective for their eradication, without requiring the more rigorous [[sterilization]] which also deactivates spores.

As a result of their adaptation to mammalian intestines, ''E. coli'' grow best ''[[in vivo]]'' or at the higher temperatures characteristic of such an environment, rather than the cooler temperatures found in soil and other environments.

==Role in disease==
''E. coli'' can generally cause several intestinal and extra-intestinal infections such as [[urinary tract]] infections, [[meningitis]], [[peritonitis]], [[mastitis]], [[septicemia]] and Gram-negative [[pneumonia]]. The enteric ''E. coli'' are divided on the basis of virulence properties into enterotoxigenic (ETEC, causative agent of diarrhea in humans, pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, dogs, and horses), enteropathogenic (EPEC, causative agent of diarrhea in humans, rabbits, dogs, cats and horses); enteroinvasive (EIEC, found only in humans), verotoxigenic (VTEC, found in pigs, cattle, dogs, and cats); enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC, found in humans, cattle, and goats, attacking porcine strains that colonize the gut in a manner similar to human EPEC strains) and enteroaggregative ''E. coli'' (EAggEC, found only in humans).

===Urinary tract infections===
Although it is more common in females due to the shorter urinary tract, urinary tract infection is seen in both males and females. It is found in roughly equal proportions in elderly men and women. Since bacteria invariably enter the urinary tract through the [[urethra]]- called "ASCENDING INFECTIONS", poor toilet habits can predispose to infection (doctors often advise women to "wipe front to back, not back to front") but other factors are also important ([[pregnancy]] in women, [[prostate]] enlargement in men) and in many cases the initiating event is unclear. While ascending infections are generally the rule for Lower urinary tract infections and cystitis, the same may not necessarily hold for upper Urinary Tract Infections like pyelonephritis which may be hematogenous in origin. Most cases of lower urinary tract infections in females are benign and do not need exhaustive laboratory work ups. However, UTI in young infants must receive some imaging study, typically a retrograde urethrogram, to ascertain the presence/absence of congenital urinary tract anomalies. Males too must be investigated furthur. The way to investigate it is to use specific methods of x-ray, MRI and CAT scan technology.

===Gastrointestinal===
If ''E. coli'' bacteria escape the intestinal tract through a perforation (a hole or tear, for example from an [[ulcer]], a [[ruptured appendix]], or a [[surgical error]]) and enter the abdomen, they usually cause [[peritonitis]] that can be fatal without prompt treatment. However, ''E. coli'' are extremely sensitive to such [[antibiotics]] as [[streptomycin]] or [[gentamycin]], so treatment with antibiotics is usually effective. This could rapidly change, since, as noted below, ''E. coli'' rapidly acquires drug resistance.<ref name=SciDaily_2001>{{cite web | title=Gene Sequence Of Deadly E. Coli Reveals Surprisingly Dynamic Genome | publisher=Science Daily | url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/01/010125082330.htm | date=2001-01-25 | accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>

Certain strains of ''E. coli'', such as ''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli O121]]'' and ''[[E. coli O104:H21]]'', are toxigenic (some produce a toxin very similar to that seen in [[dysentery]]).  They can cause [[food poisoning]] usually associated with eating cheese and contaminated meat (contaminated during or shortly after slaughter or during storage or display). O157:H7 is further notorious for causing serious, even life threatening complications like HUS ([[Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome]]). The usual countermeasure is cooking suspect meat until it reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit, or is "well done"; the alternative of careful inspection of slaughtering and butchering methods (to make sure that the animal's colon is removed and not punctured) has apparently not been systematically tried. This particular strain is believed to be associated with the [[2006 United States E. coli outbreak]] linked to fresh spinach. Severity of the illness varies considerably; it can be fatal, particularly to young children, the elderly or the immunocompromised, but is more often mild. ''E. coli'' can harbor both heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxins. The latter, termed LT, is highly similar in structure and function to [[Cholera]] toxin. It contains one 'A' subunit and five 'B' subunits arranged into one holotoxin. The B subunits assist in adherence and entry of the toxin into host intestinal cells, where the A subunit is cleaved and prevents cells from absorbing water, causing [[diarrhea]]. LT is secreted by the Type 2 secretion pathway<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tauschek M, Gorrell R, Robins-Browne RM, |title=Identification of a protein secretory pathway for the secretion of heat-labile enterotoxin by an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli | journal=PNAS | volume=99 |pages=7066-7071 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/99/10/7066}} </ref>

It has also been shown that Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), specifically O157:H7, can be found in filth flies on cattle farms, in house flies, can grow on wounded fruit and be transmitted to and by fruit flies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Szalanski A, Owens C, McKay T, Steelman C |title=Detection of Campylobacter and Escherichia coli O157:H7 from filth flies by polymerase chain reaction |journal=Med Vet Entomol |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=241-6 |year=2004 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.0269-283X.2004.00502.x/abs/ | id=PMID 15347391}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sela S, Nestel D, Pinto R, Nemny-Lavy E, Bar-Joseph M |title=Mediterranean fruit fly as a potential vector of bacterial pathogens |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=4052-6 |year=2005 |id=PMID 16000820}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Alam M, Zurek L |title=Association of Escherichia coli O157:H7 with houseflies on a cattle farm |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=7578-80 |year=2004 |id=PMID 15574966}}</ref>

Since toxigenic ''coli'' can be resident in animals which are resistant to the toxin, they may be spread through direct contact on farms, at [[petting zoo]]s, etc. They may also be spread via airborne particles in such environments.<ref>{{cite news|last=Christie|first=Tim|title=Tests suggest E. coli spread through air|publisher=The Register-Guard|date=[[2002-09-24]]|accessdate=[[2007-01-05]]|url=http://www.marlerclark.com/news/lanecountyfair6.htm}}</ref> The government asked in 1978 what the effect of overfeeding animals antibiotics would be. The American Academy of Science produced the result that antibiotic resistant ''E. coli'' would develop and would be untreatable.

''E. coli'' is a frequent member of multispecies [[biofilm]]s. Some strains are piliated and capable of accepting and transferring plasmids (rings of DNA) from and to other bacteria of the same and different species. ''E. coli'' often carry multidrug resistant plasmids and under stress readily transfer those plasmids to other species. Thus ''E. coli'' and the other enteroccia are important reservoirs of transferable antibiotic resistance.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16871972&query_hl=5&itool=pubmed_docsum] </ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16871972&query_hl=5&itool=pubmed_docsum]</ref>

''E. coli'' possess specific nucleation-precipation machinery to produce soluble amyloid oglimers and precipitate them as curli, a network of fibers which bind the bacteria to host cells and each other.  The importance of e-coli as a source or amyloid is unknown, but [[Amyloid]] fibers are a component of numerous human disease processes including Alzheimer's.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chapman M, Robinson L, Pinkner J, Roth R, Heuser J, Hammar M, Normark S, Hultgren S |title=Role of Escherichia coli curli operons in directing amyloid fiber formation |journal=Science |volume=295 |issue=5556 |pages=851-5 |year=2002 |id=PMID 11823641}}</ref> [http://hultgren.wustl.edu/public/PDFs/028_Sci0202.pdf]

==Antibiotic therapy==
Appropriate treatment depends on the disease and should be guided by laboratory analysis of the antibiotic sensitivities of the infecting strain of ''E. coli''. As Gram-negative organisms, ''E. coli'' are resistant to many antibiotics which are effective against [[Gram-positive]] organisms. Antibiotics which may be used to treat ''E. coli'' infection include (but are not limited to) [[amoxicillin]] as well as other semi-synthetic penicillins, many [[cephalosporin]]s, [[carbapenems]], [[aztreonam]],  [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[nitrofurantoin]] and the [[aminoglycoside]]s. Not all antibiotics are suitable for every disease caused by ''E. coli'', and the advice of a physician should be sought.

[[Antibiotic resistance]] is a growing problem. Some of this is due to overuse of antibiotics in humans, but some of it is probably due to the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in food animals.<ref name=Johnson_2006>{{cite journal |author=Johnson J, Kuskowski M, Menard M, Gajewski A, Xercavins M, Garau J |title=Similarity between human and chicken Escherichia coli isolates in relation to ciprofloxacin resistance status |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=194 |issue=1 |pages=71-8 |year=2006 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/JID/journal/issues/v194n1/35787/35787.html | id=PMID 16741884}}</ref>  Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has become more serious in recent decades as strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases render many, if not all, of the penicillins and cephalosporins ineffective as therapy.  Susceptibility testing should guide treatment in all infections in which the organism can be isolated for culture.

==Phage therapy==
[[Phage therapy]]&mdash;viruses that specifically target pathogenic bacteria&mdash;has been developed over the last 80 years, primarily in the former Soviet Union, where it was used to prevent diarrhea caused by ''E. coli'', among other things, in the Red Army, and was widely available over the counter. [http://www.iitd.pan.wroc.pl/phages/phages.html] Presently, phage therapy for humans is available only at the Phage Therapy Center in the Republic of Georgia [http://www.phagetherapycenter.com/pii/PatientServlet?command=static_conditions&language=0] or in Poland.[http://www.phagetherapycenter.com/pii/PatientServlet?command=static_conditions&language=0]

However on January the 2nd, 2007 the FDA gave Omnilytics approval to apply its 0157:H7 killing phage in a mist, spray or wash on live animals that will be slaughtered for human consumption.

==Vaccine==
''E. coli'' vaccines have been under development for many years.<ref name=Girard_2006>{{cite journal |author=Girard M, Steele D, Chaignat C, Kieny M |title=A review of vaccine research and development: human enteric infections |journal=Vaccine |volume=24 |issue=15 |pages=2732-50 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16483695}}</ref> In March of 2006, a vaccine eliciting an immune response against the ''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7|E. coli O157:H7]]'' O-specific polysaccharide conjugated to [[recombinant]] exotoxin A of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' (O157-rEPA) was reported to be safe and immunogenic in children two to five years old.

==Strains==
[[Image:Lifecycle of e coli.jpg|thumb|right|Model of successive binary fission in ''E. coli'']]
A "strain" of ''E. coli'' is a group with some particular characteristics that make it distinguishable from other ''E. coli'' strains. These differences are often detectable only on the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium, for example leading to [[pathogenicity]]. Different strains of ''E. coli'' live in different kinds of animals, so it is possible to tell whether fecal material in water came from humans or from birds, for example. New strains of ''E. coli'' arise all the time from the natural biological process of [[mutation]], and some of those strains have characteristics that can be harmful to a host animal. Although in most healthy adult humans such a strain would probably cause no more than a bout of [[diarrhea]], and might produce no symptoms at all, in young children, people who are or have recently been sick, or in people taking certain medications, an unfamiliar strain can cause serious illness and even death. A particularly virulent example of such a strain of ''E. coli'' is [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]].

In addition, ''E. coli'' and related bacteria possess the ability to transfer [[DNA]] via [[bacterial conjugation]], which allows a new mutation to spread through an existing population. It is believed that this process led to the spread of toxin synthesis from ''[[Shigella]]'' to ''E. coli'' O157:H7.

Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)<U+2013>producing ''E. coli'' are antibiotic-resistant strains of ''E. coli''. ESBL-producing strains are bacteria that produce an [[enzyme]] called extended-spectrum beta lactamase, which makes them more resistant to antibiotics and makes the infections harder to treat. In many instances, only two oral antibiotics and a very limited group of intravenous antibiotics remain effective.

==Role in microbiology==
Because of its ubiquity, ''E. coli'' is frequently studied in [[microbiology]] and is the current "workhorse" in [[molecular biology]]. Its structure is clear, and it makes for an excellent target for novice, intermediate, and advanced students of the life sciences. The strains used in the laboratory have adapted themselves effectively to that environment, and are no longer as well adapted to life in the mammalian intestines as the [[wild type]]; a major adaptation is the loss of the large quantities of external [[biofilm]] [[mucopolysaccharide]] produced by the wild type in order to protect itself from [[antibody|antibodies]] and other chemical attacks, but which require a large expenditure of the organism's energy and material resources. This can be seen when culturing the organisms on [[agar plate]]s; while the laboratory strains produce well defined individual [[colony (biology)|colonies]], with the wild type strains the colonies are embedded within this large mass of mucopolysaccharide, making it difficult to isolate individual colonies.

[[Bacterial conjugation]] was first discovered in ''E. coli,'' and it remains the primary model to study conjugation.

Because of this long history of laboratory culture and manipulation, ''E. coli'' plays an important role in modern [[biological engineering]]. Researchers can alter the bacteria to serve as "factories" to synthesize [[DNA]] and/or [[protein]]s, which can then be produced in large quantities using the [[industrial fermentation]] processes. One of the first useful applications of [[recombinant DNA]] technology was the manipulation of ''E. coli'' to produce human [[insulin]] for patients with [[diabetes]]. [http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm]

==Role in water purification and sewage treatment==
All the different kinds of fecal ''coli'' bacteria, and all the very similar bacteria that live in the ground (in soil or decaying plants, of which the most common is ''[[Enterobacter]] aerogenes''), are grouped together under the name ''[[coliform bacteria|coliform]]'' bacteria. Technically, the "coliform group" is defined to be all the [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[facultative anaerobe|facultative anaerobic]], non-spore-forming, [[Gram-negative]], rod-shaped bacteria that ferment [[lactose]] with the production of gas within 48 hours at 35 <U+00B0>C (95 <U+00B0>F). In the body, this gas is released as [[flatulence]]. ''E. coli'' cells are elongated, 1<U+2013>2 [[micrometre|<U+00B5>m]] in length and 0.1<U+2013>0.5 <U+00B5>m in diameter.

The presence of coliform bacteria in [[surface water]] is a common indicator of [[Water quality#Measurement of water quality|fecal contamination]]. ''E. coli'' is commonly used as a [[model organism]] for bacteria in general. This is usually done using the MPN (most probable number) tests. This is usually a probabilistic test which assumes bacteria meeting certain growth and biochemical criteria as E. coli and quantitates it by various methods. "Presence" of E. coli numbers beyond a certain cut-off indicates fecal contamination of water and indicates further investigation into the matter. Often, a "confirmatory" test - the Eijckman test is done which tests for growth at a particular temperature. Many of these tests are routinely done at water storage and distribution systems. At other places, more advanced tests have replaced them. Other organisms like Streptococcus bovis and certain clostridia species are also used as an index of fecal contamination of drinking water sources - usually animal in origin. One of the root words of the family's scientific name, "enteric", refers to the intestine, and is often used synonymously with "fecal".
In the field of [[water purification]] and [[sewage treatment]], ''E. coli'' was chosen very early in the development of the technology as an "indicator" of the pollution level of water, meaning the amount of human fecal matter in it, measured using the [[Coliform Index]]. ''E. coli'' is used for detection because there are a lot more coliforms in human feces than there are [[pathogen]]s (''[[Salmonella typhi]]'' is an example of such a pathogen, causing [[typhoid]] fever), and ''E. coli'' is usually harmless, so it can't "get loose" in the lab and hurt anyone. However, sometimes it can be misleading to use ''E. coli'' alone as an indicator of human fecal contamination because there are other environments in which ''E. coli'' grows well, such as [[paper mill]]s.
