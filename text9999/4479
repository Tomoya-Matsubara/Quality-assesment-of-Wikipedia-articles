'''Maidstone and The Weald''' is a [[county constituency]] which elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. 

==Boundaries==
It is located in the west of the county of [[Kent]] in south eastern [[England]] and includes parts of the areas of [[Maidstone (borough)|Maidstone]] and [[Tunbridge Wells (borough)|Tunbridge Wells]] boroughs. Towns include [[Maidstone]] and [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] and [[Tenterden]].

===Boundary review===
Following their review of parliamentary representation in Kent, the [[Boundary Commission for England]] has made major changes to the existing constituency boundaries as a consequence of population changes across the county. The modified Maidstone and The Weald constituency is formed from the following electoral wards:
*Allington, Barming, Bridge, Coxheath, Hunton and [[Linton, Kent|Linton]], East, Fant, Heath, High Street, Loose, Marden and Yalding, North, South and Staplehurst from the borough of Maidstone.
*Benenden and Cranbrook, and Frittenden and Sissinghurst from Tunbridge Wells.

==History==

The constituency was created for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], partially replacing the earlier [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] constituency. 

The Maidstone town wards which had been in [[Mid Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Kent]] since 1983 rejoined the Maidstone seat, and a rural part of the Weald to the south of the town, previously in the [[Tunbridge Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Tunbridge Wells]] constituency was also included; but about a third of the electorate in the Maidstone constituency was transferred to the [[Faversham and Mid Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Faversham and Mid Kent]] constituency - this included the rural wards to the east of the town, but also the Shepway and [[Park Wood, Maidstone|Park Wood]] areas of Maidstone proper. 

The constituency is still rural ([[hops|hop-growing]] being a significant activity), although there is a degree of light engineering too and many residents commute to [[London]].

==Members of Parliament==

The MP for the seat since its creation in 1997 has been Ann Widdecombe of the Conservative Party. She was previously MP for the former seat of Maidstone from 1987, and served as a Home Office minister in the government of John Major from 1995 to 1997, and as Shadow Home Secretary from 1999 to 2001. She has announced that she will not contest the next general election.
