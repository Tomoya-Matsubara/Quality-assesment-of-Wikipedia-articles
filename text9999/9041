The '''Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe''' ('''OSCE''') is the world's largest security-oriented [[intergovernmental organization]]. Its mandate includes issues such as [[arms control]] and the promotion of [[human rights]], [[freedom of the press]] and fair elections. It has 550 staff at its headquarters in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and 2,300 field staff. It has its origins in the 1975 Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in [[Helsinki]], Finland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/who/86|title=Funding and budget|publisher=}}</ref>

The OSCE is concerned with early warning, conflict prevention, [[crisis management]], and post-conflict rehabilitation. Its 57 participating states are located in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Northern America|North America]] and cover most of the land area of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It was created during the [[Cold War]] era as an East<U+2013>West forum.<ref name=galbreath>{{cite book|last=Galbreath|first=David J.|title=The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780203960943}}</ref>

It currently takes an important role in the monitoring of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, though it has been accused on mid November 2014 of showing a pro-Russian bias.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/osce-denies-allegations-of-bias-in-russias-favor-in-ukraines-east-371446.html|title=OSCE denies allegations of pro-Russian bias in Ukraine's east|work=KyivPost}}</ref> This accusation is also based on the fact that one of its most prominent members, currently in Ukraine, Alexey Lyzhenkov,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/node/109110|title=Alexey Lyzhenkov|publisher=}}</ref> is an ex-official of Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, close to [[Sergey Lavrov]].

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0805-314, Helsinki, KSZE-Konferenz, Schlussakte.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Bruno Kreisky]] at the 1975 CSCE summit in [[Helsinki]], Finland.]]

The Organization has its roots in the 1973 '''Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe''' (CSCE). Talks had been mooted about a European security grouping since the 1950s but the [[Cold War]] prevented any substantial progress until the talks at [[Dipoli]] in [[Espoo]] began in November 1972. These talks were held at the suggestion of the [[Soviet Union]] which wished to use the talks to maintain its control over the [[Communism|communist]] countries in [[Eastern Europe]], and [[President of Finland]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] hosted them in order to bolster his [[Paasikivi-Kekkonen line|policy of neutrality]]. [[Western Europe]], however, saw these talks as a way to reduce the tension in the region, furthering economic cooperation and obtaining humanitarian improvements for the populations of the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist bloc]].

The recommendations of the talks, in the form of "The Blue Book", gave the practical foundations for a three-stage conference called the "Helsinki process".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The CSCE opened in Helsinki on 3 July 1973 with 35 states sending representatives. Stage&nbsp;I only took five days to agree to follow the Blue Book. Stage&nbsp;II was the main working phase and was conducted in [[Geneva]] from 18 September 1973 until 21 July 1975. The result of Stage&nbsp;II was the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]] which was signed by the 35 participating states during Stage&nbsp;III, which took place in [[Finlandia Hall]] from 30 July <U+2013> 1 August 1975. It was opened by [[Holy See]]<U+2019>s diplomat Cardinal [[Agostino Casaroli]], who was chairman of the conference.

The concepts of improving relations and implementing the act were developed over a series of follow-up meeting, with major gatherings in [[Belgrade]] (4 October 1977{{spaced ndash}}8 March 1978), [[Madrid]] (11 November 1980{{spaced ndash}}9 September 1983) and [[Vienna]] (4 November 1986{{spaced ndash}}19 January 1989).

The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] required a change of role for the CSCE. The [[Paris Charter|Charter of Paris for a New Europe]], signed on 21 November 1990, marked the beginning of this change. <!--Huh?:-->With the changes capped by the renaming of the CSCE to the OSCE on 1 January 1995, accordingly to the results of the conference held in [[Budapest]], Hungary, in 1994. The OSCE now had a formal secretariat, Senior Council, Parliamentary Assembly, Conflict Prevention Centre, and Office for Free Elections (later becoming the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights).

In December 1996, the "[[Lisbon]] Declaration on a Common and Comprehensive Security Model for Europe for the Twenty-First Century" affirmed the universal and indivisible nature of security on the European continent.

In [[Istanbul]] on 19 November 1999, the OSCE ended a two-day summit by calling for a political settlement in [[Chechnya]] and adopting a [[Charter for European Security]]. According to then Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Igor Ivanov]], this summit marked a turning point in Russian perception of the OSCE, from an organization that expressed Europe's collective will, to an organization that serves as a [[Western world|Western]] tool for "forced democratization".<ref>Ivanov, Igor S., ''The New Russian Diplomacy'', [[Nixon Center]] and [[Brookings Institution]] Press: [[Washington, D.C.]], 2002. pp. 97-98.</ref>

After a group of thirteen [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States]] [[United States Senate|senators]]  {{Who|date=April 2010}} petitioned [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] to have foreign election monitors oversee the 2004 [[United States presidential election, 2004|presidential election]], the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] acquiesced, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] invited the OSCE to do so.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-10-osce-observers_x.htm U.S. invites international observers to Nov election]", ''[[USA Today]]'', 10 August 2004</ref><ref>"[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200408%5CPOL20040809c.html International Monitoring of US Election Called 'Frightening']", ''Cybercast News Service''</ref>

== Legal Status ==
A unique aspect of the OSCE is the non-binding status of its constitutive charter. Rather than being a formal [[treaty]] ratified by national [[legislature]]s, the OSCE Final Act represents a political commitment by the [[head of government|heads of government]] of all signatories to build security and cooperation in Europe on the basis of its provisions. This allows the OSCE to remain a flexible ''process'' for the evolution of improved cooperation which avoids disputes and/or sanctions over implementation. By agreeing to these commitments, signatories for the first time accepted that treatment of citizens ''within'' their borders was also a matter of legitimate international concern.  This open process of the OSCE is often given credit for helping build democracy in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, thus leading to the end of the Cold War. Unlike most international intergovernmental organizations, however, the OSCE is deprived of international legal personality on account of the lack of legal effect of its charter.<ref>"[http://www.osce.org/secretariat/36184 Making a credible case for a legal personality for the OSCE]", OSCE Secretariat</ref> As a result, its headquarters host, [[Austria]], had to confer legal personality on the organization in order to be able to sign a legal agreement regarding its presence in [[Vienna]].

== Structure and institutions ==
Political direction to the organization is given by heads of state or government during summits. Summits are not regular or scheduled but held as needed. The last summit took place in Astana (Kazakhstan), on 1 and 2 December 2010. The high-level decision-making body of the organization is the Ministerial Council, which meets at the end of every year. At ambassadorial level the Permanent Council convenes weekly in Vienna and serves as the regular negotiating and decision-making body. The post of chairman-in-office is held by the minister for foreign affairs of the participating State which holds the chairmanship. The chairperson of the Permanent Council is the ambassador to Austria of the participating State which holds the chairmanship. From 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 the Chairman-in-Office is [[T<U+00E1>naiste]] ([[deputy prime minister]]) and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade]] of Ireland, [[Eamon Gilmore]], who succeeded Lithuanian Foreign Minister [[Audronius A<U+017E>ubalis]].

In addition to the Ministerial Council and Permanent Council, the Forum for Security Co-operation is also an OSCE decision-making body. It deals predominantly with matters of military co-operation, such as modalities for inspections according to the Vienna Document of 1999.<ref>[http://www.osce.org/documents/fsc/1999/11/4265_en.pdf Vienna Document]</ref>

The OSCE's Secretariat is located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The current Secretary General is [[Lamberto Zannier]] of Italy, who took over from [[Marc Perrin de Brichambaut]] of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/sg/78779|accessdate=2011-07-06|title=Secretary General|date=20 June 2011}}</ref> The organization also has offices in [[Copenhagen]], [[Geneva]], [[The Hague]], [[Prague]] and [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]].

[[File:OSCE-Permanent Council.JPG|thumb|A meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council at the [[Hofburg]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].]]
The OSCE employs close to 440 persons in its various institutions. In the field, the organization has about 750 international and 2,370 national staff.

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] passes resolutions on matters such as political and security affairs, economic and environmental issues, and democracy and human rights. Representing the collective voice of OSCE parliamentarians, these resolutions and recommendations are meant to ensure that all participating states live up to their OSCE commitments. The Parliamentary Assembly also engages in parliamentary diplomacy, and has an extensive election observation program.

The oldest OSCE institution is the [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR), established in 1991 following a decision made at the 1990 [[Paris Charter|Summit of Paris]]. It is based in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], and is active throughout the OSCE area in the fields of [[election observer|election observation]], democratic development, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, rule of law, and [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]] issues. The ODIHR has observed over 150 elections and referendums since 1995, sending some 35,000 observers. It has operated outside its own area twice, sending a team that offered technical support to the 9 October 2004 presidential elections in [[Afghanistan]], an OSCE Partner for Co-operation, and an election support team to assist with parliamentary and provincial council elections on 18 September 2005. ODIHR is headed by [[Janez Lenar<U+010D>i<U+010D>]].

The Office of the [[OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media]], established in December 1997, acts as a watchdog to provide early warning on violations of [[freedom of expression]] in OSCE participating States. The representative also assists participating States by advocating and promoting full compliance with OSCE norms, principles and commitments regarding freedom of expression and free media. As of 2011, the current representative is expert in media law from Bosnia and Herzegovina [[Dunja Mijatovic]].<ref>[http://www.osce.org/fom/43206 Representative on Freedom of the Media]</ref>

== Secretary General ==
The list of the Secretary General of OSCE since creation of this post in 1992 is as follows:

# {{flagicon|GER}} [[Wilhelm Hoynck]] (1993<U+2013>1996)
# {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Giancarlo Aragona]] (1996<U+2013>1999)

# {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Lamberto Zannier]] (2011-)

== Chairmanship ==
[[File:Hofburg OSCE.JPG|thumb|right|OSCE Permanent Council site at the Hofburg, Vienna]]
The responsibilities of the Chairman-in-Office (CiO) include
* co-ordination of the work of OSCE institutions;
* representing the Organization;
* supervising activities related to conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation.
The chairmanship rotates annually, and the post of the chairman-in-office is held by the foreign minister of the participating State which holds the chairmanship. The CiO is assisted by the previous and incoming chairman-in-office; the three of them together constitute the [[Troika (triumvirate)|Troika]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The OSCE Chair-in-Office (CiO)|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/osce/chairman-president.aspx?lang=eng|website=http://www.international.gc.ca/|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref> The origin of the institution lies with the Charter of Paris for a New Europe (1990), the Helsinki Document 1992 formally institutionalized this function.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who we are|url=http://www.osce.org/sq/node/108325|website=http://www.osce.org/|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>

The 2012 Troika consists of the current CiO, T<U+00E1>naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, [[Eamon Gilmore]]; the former CiO, Lithuanian Foreign Minister [[Audronius A<U+017E>ubalis]]; and the incoming CiO, Ukrainian Foreign Minister [[Kostyantyn Hryshchenko]].

== Relations with the United Nations ==
The OSCE considers itself a regional organization in the sense of [[Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/ec/43240 |title=Secretariat - External Cooperation |publisher=OSCE}}</ref> and is an [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer]] in the [[United Nations General Assembly]].<ref name="UN_ARES485">{{UN document |docid=A-RES-48-5 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=48 |resolution_number=5 |accessdate=2008-10-01 |date=22 October 1993 |title=Observer status for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in the General Assembly}}</ref>  The Chairman-in-Office gives routine briefings to the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5982 |body=Security Council |type=Verbatim Report |meeting=5982 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk06 |date=26 September 2008 |speakername=Mr. Stubb | speakernation=Finland |accessdate=2008-10-01 }}</ref>

== Politico-military dimension (first dimension) ==
The OSCE takes a comprehensive approach to the [[politico-military]] dimension of security, which includes a number of commitments by participating States and mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. The organization also seeks to enhance military security by promoting greater openness, transparency and co-operation.

; [[Arms control]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/arms-control|title=Arms control|publisher=}}</ref>
The end of the Cold War resulted in a huge amount of surplus weapons becoming available in what is known as the international [[grey market]] for weapons. The OSCE helps to stop the - often illegal - spread of such weapons and offers assistance with their destruction.  The OSCE hosts the annual exchange of information under the [[Conventional Forces in Europe]] treaty.  The OSCE has also implemented two additional exchanges of information, the [[Vienna Document]] and the [[Global Exchange of Military Information]].  The [[Open Skies Consultative Commission]], the implementing body for the [[Treaty on Open Skies]], meets monthly at its Vienna headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/oscc|title=Open Skies Consultative Commission|publisher=}}</ref>

; Border management<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/borders|title=Border management|publisher=}}</ref>
The actions taken by the OSCE in border monitoring range from conflict prevention to post-conflict management, capacity building and institutional support.

; Combating terrorism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/terrorism|title=Combating terrorism|publisher=}}</ref>
With its expertise in conflict prevention, crisis management and early warning, the OSCE contributes to worldwide efforts in [[counter-terrorism|combating terrorism]].

; Conflict prevention<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/what/conflict-prevention|title=Conflict prevention and resolution|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/cpc|title=Conflict prevention and resolution|publisher=}}</ref>
The OSCE works to prevent conflicts from arising and to facilitate lasting comprehensive political settlements for existing conflicts. It also helps with the process of rehabilitation in post-conflict areas.

; Military reform
The OSCE's Forum for Security Co-operation provides a framework for political dialogue on military reform, while practical activities are conducted by field operations, as well as the Conflict Prevention Centre.

; Policing
OSCE police operations are an integral part of the organization's efforts in conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

; Implementation
The OSCE was a rather small organization until selection by the international community to provide electoral organization to post war Bosnia and Herzegovina in early 1996. Ambassador Frowick was the first OSCE representative to initiate national election in September 1996, human rights issues and rule of law specifically designed to provide a foundation for judicial organization within Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The OSCE had regional offices and field offices, to include the office in Brcko in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina which remained in limbo until the Brcko Arbitration Agreement could be decided, finalized and implemented.

Brcko become a "special district" and remains so today.

The OSCE essentially took the place of the United Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina in part because the Bosnian leadership felt deep contempt for the UN efforts to stop the war which began in 1991 and ended in 1995. During the time the United Nations were attempting a political solution, thousands of UN troops were posted in and around Bosnia and Herzegovina with special emphasis on Sarajevo. Between the inclusive dates of 1991 through 1995, over 200,000 Bosnians were killed and over one million displaced and another million as refugees.

The OSCE continues to have a presence and a number of initiatives to bring a sustained peace to the region.

== Economic and environmental dimension (second dimension) ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

Activities in the economic and environmental dimension include the monitoring of developments related to economic and environmental security in OSCE participating States, with the aim of alerting them to any threat of conflict; assisting States in the creation of economic and environmental policies, legislation and institutions to promote security in the OSCE region.

; Economic activities
Among the economic activities of the OSCE feature activities related to migration management, transport and energy security. Most activities are implemented in co-operation with partner organizations.

; Environmental activities
The OSCE has developed a range of activities in the environmental sphere aimed at addressing ecologic threats to security in its participating States. Among the activities feature projects in the area of hazardous waste, water management and access to information under the [[Aarhus Convention]].

== Human dimension (third dimension) ==
The commitments made by OSCE participating States in the [[three generations of human rights|human dimension]] aim to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to abide by the [[rule of law]]; to promote the principles of democracy by building, strengthening and protecting democratic institutions; and to promote [[toleration|tolerance]] throughout the OSCE region.

;Combating trafficking in human beings
Since 2003 the OSCE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osce.org/cthb|title=Combating trafficking in human beings|publisher=}}</ref> has had an established mechanism for combating trafficking in human beings, as defined by Article 3 of the [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|Palermo Protocol]],<ref>[http://untreaty.un.org/English/TreatyEvent2003/Texts/treaty2E.pdf Palermo Protocol]</ref> which is aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within participating states to tackle it effectively.

The OSCE actions against [[human trafficking|trafficking in human beings]] are coordinated by the Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osce.org/cthb|title=Combating trafficking in human beings|publisher=}}</ref> [[Maria Grazia Giammarinaro]],<ref>[http://www.osce.org/cthb/43180 Maria Grazia Giammarinaro]</ref> a judge in the Criminal Court of Rome, took Office as the Special Representative in March 2010. From 2006 to 2009 this Office was held by [[Eva Biaudet]], a former Finnish Minister of Health and Social Services. Biaudet currently serves as Finnish Ombudsman for Minorities. Her predecessor was former Austrian Minister Helga Conrad, who served as the first OSCE Special Representative for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings.

The activities around Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region of the Office of the Special Representative include:<ref>[http://www.osce.org/publications/cthb/2007/10/27431_971_en.pdf Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region]</ref>
* Co-operation with governments, helping them to accept and act on their responsibilities for curbing trafficking in human beings;
* Providing governments with decision and policy-making aids and offering guidance on anti-trafficking management, with the aim of arriving at solutions tailored to the needs of the individual countries and in line with international standards;
* Assisting governments to develop the national anti-trafficking structures required for efficient internal and transnational co-operation;
* Raising awareness to draw attention to the complexity of the problem and to the need for comprehensive solutions;
* Considering all dimensions of [[human trafficking]], namely trafficking for [[sexual exploitation]], trafficking for [[forced labour|forced and bonded labour]], including domestic servitude, trafficking into [[forced marriage]]s, trafficking in organs and trafficking in children;
* Ensuring the effective interaction of all agents and stake holders involved in the fight against human trafficking, ranging from governmental authorities, law enforcement officials to NGOs, and<U+2014>last but not least<U+2014>[[international organization]]s, as the agencies providing support thorough expertise and know-how;
* Guaranteeing the highest possible visibility of the OSCE's fight against human trafficking to focus attention on the issue.

;Democratization
The OSCE claims to promote democracy and assist the participating states in building [[democratization|democratic institutions]]. In practice, however, few states have more power in decision-making than others.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

;Education
Education programmes are an integral part of the organization's efforts in conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

;Elections
As part of its democratization activities, the OSCE carries out election assistance projects in the run-up to, during, and following elections. However, the effectiveness of such assistance is arguable<U+2014>Kazakhstan, for example, despite being the former chair of the OSCE, is considered by many to be one of the least democratic countries in the world. Moreover, the recent democratic advances made in other Central Asian republics, notably Kyrgyzstan, have led to rumours of Soviet-style disruption of the Kyrgyz democratic process by, in particular, Kazakhstan and Russia. This may be in large part due to fears over the long-term stability of these countries' own quasi-dictatorships.

;Gender equality
The equality of men and women is an integral part of sustainable democracy. The OSCE aims to provide equal opportunities for men and women and to integrate [[gender equality]] in policies and practices.

;Human rights
The OSCE's [[human rights]] activities focus on such priorities as [[freedom of movement]] and religion, preventing torture and trafficking in persons.

;National and international NGOs
OSCE could grant [[Consultative Status|consultive status]] to [[NGOs]] and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]] in the form of "Researcher-in-residence programme" (run by the Prague Office of the OSCE Secretariat): accredited representatives of national and international NGOs are granted access to all records and to numerous topical compilations related to OSCE field activities.

;Media freedom
The OSCE observes relevant media developments in its participating states with a view to addressing and providing early warning on violations of [[freedom of expression]].

;Minority rights
Ethnic conflict is one of the main sources of large-scale violence in Europe today. The OSCE's approach is to identify and to seek early resolution of ethnic tensions, and to set standards for the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group]]s and [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] has been established.

== Criticism ==
Following an unprecedented period of activity in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the OSCE has in the past few years faced accusations from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states (primarily [[Russia]]) of being a tool for the Western states to advance their own interests. For instance, the events in [[Ukraine]] in 2004 (the "[[Orange Revolution]]") led to allegations by Russia of OSCE involvement on behalf of the pro-Western [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. At the 2007 [[Munich Conference on Security Policy]], [[Vladimir Putin]] made this position very clear:
::"They [unnamed Western States] are trying to transform the OSCE into a vulgar instrument designed to promote the foreign policy interests of one or a group of countries. And this task is also being accomplished by the OSCE's bureaucratic apparatus, which is absolutely not connected with the state founders in any way. Decision-making procedures and the involvement of so-called non-governmental organizations are tailored for this task. These organizations are formally independent but they are purposefully financed and therefore under control".<ref>[http://www.kommersant.com/p741749/r_527/Munich_Speech_Vladimir_Putin/ The Munich Speech]", ''Kommersant Moscow''</ref><ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/04/d7ca7f94-db49-4c08-9091-877484741f26.html [OSCE: Election Experts Debate Russian Criticism&#93; - [Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty <U+00A9> 2008&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.brama.com/news/press/2004/07/040729csce.html Criticism of OSCE by Nine CIS Countries Draws the Response<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspr.ac.at/osce_report06.pdf|title=Austrian Study Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution (ASPR) - Peace Castle Austria|publisher=}}</ref>

Also, following the Belorussian Presidential election of 2001, the OSCE denounced the election, claiming it to be neither 'free nor fair'; however, the OSCE had actually refused to observe the vote, and still made the aforementioned claim, despite G<U+00E9>rard Stoudmann of the [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR) of the OSCE acknowledging that there was "no evidence of manipulation or fraud of the results".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Russia and its allies are advancing the concept of a comprehensive OSCE reform, which would make the Secretariat, institutions and field presences more centralized and accountable to collective consensus-based bodies and focus the work of the Organization on topical security issues (human trafficking, terrorism, non-proliferation, arms control, etc.), at the expense of the "Human Dimension", or human rights issues. The move to reduce the autonomy of the theoretically independent OSCE institutions, such as ODIHR, would effectively grant a Russian veto over any OSCE activity. Western participating States are opposing this process, which they see as an attempt to prevent the OSCE from carrying out its democratization agenda in post-Soviet countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Following the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]], OSCE's ODIHR was accused of having double standards by Russia's lawmaker Slutsky. The point was made that while numerous violations of the voting process were registered, its criticism came only from within the United States (media, human rights organizations, McCain's election staff), while the OSCE known for its bashing criticism of elections on the post-Soviet space remained silent.<ref>"[http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=-13534 OSCE, ODIHR Showed Double Standard at U.S. Election, Russia<U+2019>s Lawmaker Said]", [[Kommersant]], 6 November 2008</ref><ref>"[http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2005/03/13658_en.pdf OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission Final Report]" of the U.S. 2008 presidential election</ref>

=== OSCE Parliamentary Assembly ===

In 2004 the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly sent [[election observer]]s to the U.S. Presidential elections. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly<U+2019>s president at the time was Democratic Congressman [[Alcee Hastings]]. Hastings had previously been impeached for corruption by the U.S. Congress. The OSCE faced criticism of partisanship and double standards due to Hastings's past and the fact that the OSCE's mandate was to promote democracy and the values of civil society.<ref>{{cite news|title=US vote 'mostly free and fair'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/americas/2004/vote_usa_2004/3987655.stm|accessdate=23 December 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=5 November 2004}}</ref>

In 2010 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] was criticized from within by the Latvian delegation for lacking transparency and democracy. [[Spencer Oliver]] (b. 1938) secretary general of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, who has held the post since the organization's inception in 1992, faced a challenge from the Latvian [[Artis Pabriks]]. According to the rules of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly the incumbent general secretary can only be replaced with a full consensus minus one. Pabriks called the rules "quite shocking from the perspective of an organization that's monitoring elections".<ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0710/An_election_in_Copenhagen.html An election in Copenhagen] politico.com</ref>

In 2014 Ilkka Kanerva was elected the president of the OSCE PA. Kanerva had previously been fired from his post as foreign minister of Finland after lying about sending over 200 text messages to an erotic dancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583679/Finnish-minister-quits-over-saucy-texts.html|title=Finnish minister quits over saucy texts|author=Graeme Baker|date=2 April 2008|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

In 2012 Kanerva was found guilty of violation of duties and accepting bribes in relation to an election funding scandal and received a three and a half year suspended sentence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/index.php/finland/finland-news/politics/1967-suspended-sentence-for-ncp-s-kanerva|title=Suspended sentence for NCP<U+2019>s Kanerva|author=HT|publisher=}}</ref>

=== 2012 Texas controversy ===
Before the U.S. presidential elections of November 2012, the OSCE announced its intention to send electoral observers to Texas and to other [[U.S. state]]s. In response, [[Greg Abbott]], the Attorney General of Texas, sent letters to U.S. [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] threatening to arrest OSCE officials if they should enter electoral premises in Texas and break [[Texas law]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagnews/release.php?id=4199|title=Texas Attorney General|publisher=}}</ref> and to the OSCE.<ref>[https://www.oag.state.tx.us/newspubs/releases/2012/102312abbot_letter.pdf ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS] oag.state.tx.us</ref> In response, the U.S. Department of State indicated that OSCE observers enjoyed immunities.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2012/10/199824.htm#DEPARTMENT Daily Press Briefing: October 26, 2012] US State Department</ref> However no incidents between OSCE and Texas authorities were recorded during the elections.

=== Allegations of pro-Russian bias (2014) ===
The organization has come under increasing criticism in the Russian-Ukraine conflict. During the [[War in Donbass]] an OSCE observer allowed Russian separatists to use the organization's marked vehicle which prompted the belief that OSCE was bias in the war and not interested in carrying out its duties of mediating a ceasefire. The organization issued a statement regretting the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ru.tsn.ua/politika/nablyudateli-obse-vozili-v-svoem-avtomobile-vooruzhennyh-boevikov-389982.html|publisher=TSN|title=<U+041D><U+0430><U+0431><U+043B><U+044E><U+0434><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+0438> <U+041E><U+0411><U+0421><U+0415> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0437><U+0438><U+043B><U+0438> <U+0432> <U+0441><U+0432><U+043E><U+0435><U+043C> <U+0430><U+0432><U+0442><U+043E><U+043C><U+043E><U+0431><U+0438><U+043B><U+0435> <U+0432><U+043E><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+0436><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0445> <U+0431><U+043E><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0411><U+043E><U+043B><U+044C><U+0448><U+0435> <U+0447><U+0438><U+0442><U+0430><U+0439><U+0442><U+0435> <U+0437><U+0434><U+0435><U+0441><U+044C>: http://ru.tsn.ua/politika/nablyudateli-obse-vozili-v-svoem-avtomobile-vooruzhennyh-boevikov-389982.html|date=3 Oct 2014}}</ref> The organization has also been criticized by Ukraine for failing to monitor the implementation of the [[Minsk Protocol]]. The agreement called for a creation of a 40&nbsp;km buffer zone, upon Ukrainian forces withdrawing from their 20&nbsp;km portion of the buffer Russian separatist simply occupied the abandoned territory without withdrawing in their own 20&nbsp;km buffer. Likewise there continues to be reports of separatists using OSCE marked vehicles for transportation. Moreover the mission also received criticism that only 2 checkpoints on the Russian-Ukrainian border are currently being monitored which has been described as "seriously inadequate" by Daniel Baerm the US ambassador to the OSCE. The mission has also been criticized for waiting  months to deploy drones to help monitor the border as well as withdrawing them after only several weeks of use due to Russian electronic attacks. Ukraine has stated that approximately 80% of the OSCE observers located near [[Mariupol]] were Russian citizens and many had ties to Russian security agencies such as the FSB and GRU. The organization has also been accused of revealing the locations of Ukrainian troops to Russian forces during the conflict and that Russian OSCE observers may be directly coordinating separatist artillery strikes on Ukrainian positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osce.einnews.com/article__detail/233848306?lcode=xlBANnWjcZIh_XzBy9uIdg%3D%3D|publisher=OSCE news|title=The OSCE monitoring mission has stopped using drones to monitor the situation in the rebel-held territories}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://euroua.com/europe/osce/3258-missiya-obse-v-ukraine-pod-shkvalom-kritiki|publisher=EuroUA|title=<U+041C><U+0438><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F> <U+041E><U+0411><U+0421><U+0415> <U+0432> <U+0423><U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0438><U+043D><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0434> <U+0448><U+043A><U+0432><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E><U+043C> <U+043A><U+0440><U+0438><U+0442><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438>}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/articles/politics/_litvin-rasskazal-genseku-obse-chto-kritika-v-adres-ukrainy-ne-vsegda-ob-ektivna/400033|publisher=Gazeta|title=<U+041B><U+0438><U+0442><U+0432><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+0437><U+0430><U+043B> <U+0433><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+0435><U+043A><U+0443> <U+041E><U+0411><U+0421><U+0415>, <U+0447><U+0442><U+043E> <U+043A><U+0440><U+0438><U+0442><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0432> <U+0430><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441> <U+0423><U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0438><U+043D><U+044B> <U+043D><U+0435> <U+0432><U+0441><U+0435><U+0433><U+0434><U+0430> <U+043E><U+0431><U+044A><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430>}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.liga.net/news/politics/4011607-rossiya_uznala_ot_obse_mesta_dislokatsii_ryada_podrazdeleniy_sil_ato.htm|publisher=Liga|title=<U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0443><U+0437><U+043D><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430> <U+043E><U+0442> <U+041E><U+0411><U+0421><U+0415> <U+043C><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0434><U+0438><U+0441><U+043B><U+043E><U+043A><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0440><U+044F><U+0434><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0434><U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+0434><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0441><U+0438><U+043B> <U+0410><U+0422><U+041E>}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/rus/news/minoboroni_80_sotrudnikov_obse_v_mariupole__rossiyane_sredi_nih_fsbshniki_1682979|publisher=Ukrinform|title=<U+041C><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0431><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+043D><U+044B>: 80% <U+0441><U+043E><U+0442><U+0440><U+0443><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432> <U+041E><U+0411><U+0421><U+0415> <U+0432> <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0443><U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435> <U+2013> <U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F><U+043D><U+0435>, <U+0441><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0438> <U+043D><U+0438><U+0445> <U+0424><U+0421><U+0411><U+0448><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438>}}</ref> On 1 December 2014 an OSCE observer was injured by Ukrainian counter artillery fire while observing militants firing at Ukrainian forces. The OSCE team was located next to two pro Russian mortar teams. The OSCE team did not radio in or record the Russian mortar team firing on Ukrainian positions. Critics stated that the unorthodox behavior of being located next to an active separatist artillery position and not reporting the incident showed that the OSCE team was not acting in an impartial manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://burkonews.info/osce-observer-wounded-counter-fire-observing-separatist-militia-firing-mortar-ukrainian-forces/|publisher=BurkoNews|title=OSCE observer is wounded from counter-fire while observing separatist militia firing a mortar at Ukrainian forces.}}</ref>
