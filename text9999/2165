[[Image:Tiestoinconcert2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Ti<U+00EB>sto in Concert 2]], [[2004]]<br>[[Arnhem]], [[Gelredome]]]]
Late in [[2000]], Ti<U+00EB>sto decided to concentrate on his personal work and left Corsten by himself to write and produce Gouryella's next single with [[John Ewbank]], the record company was demanding more tracks and neither Ti<U+00EB>sto or Ferry could work together at the time.<ref name="Ti<U+00EB>sto Interview"/><ref name="Gouryella">{{citeweb|title=Gouryella|url=http://www.thedjlist.com/djs/GOURYELLA/|publisher=The DJ List|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref> Ti<U+00EB>sto introduced [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Johan Gielen]] and [[Ferry Corsten]] to the mainstream with his first compilations and the ''In Trance We Trust (series)''.

and the release of [[In My Memory]], his first solo album released in 2001 which contained 10 singles. His fame continued to skyrocket in the early 2000s following his six-hour "Ti<U+00EB>sto Solo" sets which he performed without other DJs or opening acts. This idea, of one DJ playing alone to a large crowd, was brought to its pinnacle when Ti<U+00EB>sto was the first DJ to hold a solo concert in a stadium; on [[May 10]] [[2003]], he performed for over 25,000 people in [[Arnhem]]'s [[Gelredome]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Encyclopedia of Dutch Rock Music: DJ Ti<U+00EB>sto Biography|url=http://www.hollandrocks.com/jump/bio/bz5269.html|publisher=Dutch Rock & Pop Institute|accessdate=2008-04-20}}

On [[August 20]] [[2005]] Verwest took "Ti<U+00EB>sto in Concert" to the United States when he played to thousands of fans in [[Los Angeles, California]] in the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]]. For the second year in a row he performed live at a  New Year's Eve/New Year's concert in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] at the [[Orleans Arena]] to a sell-out crowd.
