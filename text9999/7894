"'''Ride My See-Saw'''" is a hit single by the English [[progressive rock]] band [[The Moody Blues]].  It was written by the band's bassist [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]], and was first released on the Moody Blues 1968 album [[In Search of the Lost Chord]], and was one of two singles from that album, the other being "[[Voices in the Sky]]."  On the album, Ride My See-Saw is the second track, and is preceded by [[Graeme Edge]]'s poem "Departure."  "Departure" ends with hysterical laughter, which then segues into Ride My See-Saw.  The single was released later in 1968, and the opening laughter from "Departure" was removed for the single release.
