'''M-146''' was a [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the US state of [[Michigan]] that initially served as a bypass for traffic going around [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]] and as a short cut for traffic between [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|U.S. Highway&nbsp;25]] (US 25) and [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]]. Later it connected to the [[Blue Water Bridge]] before it was truncated to its final form. Segments of M-146 still exist today as state highways as part of [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|Interstate&nbsp;94]] (I-94) and [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] and the Lapeer Connector.

==Route description==
As the highway last existed, its southern end was at an intersection with M-21 (Lapeer Road) in a residential area of Port Huron west of the [[Black River (St. Clair County)|Black River]]. Following what is today named the Lapeer Connector, M-146 ran northward for about {{convert|0.9|mi|km}} to an interchange with I-94/US&nbsp;25 where it terminated.<ref name=MDSH66/><ref name="google">{{google maps |url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/42.9782408,-82.457474/42.990939,-82.4584532/@42.9864705,-82.4553806,3742m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!4m7!1m4!3m3!1m2!1d-82.459259!2d42.982298!1m0!3e0?hl=en |title= Overview Map of the Former M-146 |accessdate= March 31, 2015 }}</ref>

==History==
When the route debuted in 1933 it served as a connector between US 25 in southwest Port Huron and M-21 along the west side of the side.<ref name=MSHD33-05>{{cite MDOT map |date= 1933-05-01 |link= yes |c-link= yes |inset= Port Huron }}</ref><ref name=MSHD33-09>{{cite MDOT map |date= 1933-09-01 |inset= Port Huron}}</ref>  In 1954 a new approach was built from M-21 to the foot of the Blue Water Bridge, and M-146 was extended northward and easterly, designated along this new route.<ref name=MSHD54-04>{{cite MDOT map |date= 1954-04-15 |inset= Port Huron}}</ref><ref name=MSHD54-10>{{cite MDOT map |date= 1954-10-01 |inset= Port Huron}}</ref> By 1958, this newer segment was converted to freeway specifications,<ref name=MSDH57-10>{{cite MDOT map |date= 1957-10-01 |section= K14}}</ref><ref name=MSHD58>{{cite MDOT map |year= 1958 |section=K14}}</ref> and in 1964, with the completion of the I-94/US&nbsp;25 freeway, M-146 was removed from that portion of the route.<ref name=MSHD64>{{cite MDOT map |year= 1964 |section= K14}}</ref><ref name=MSHD65>{{cite MDOT map |year= 1965 |section= K14}}</ref> By the next year, the M-146 designation only remained along the stretch of freeway which now serves as the exit 274 interchange on I-94, and was removed from 24th Street through town.<ref name=MDSH66>{{cite MDOT map |year= 1966 |sections= K13<U+2013>K14 |link= yes}}</ref><ref name= MSHD65/> In 1966, with the completion of a new freeway alignment for M-21 between [[Wadhams, Michigan|Wadhams]] and downtown Port Huron, the M-146 designation was removed from the state trunkline system,<ref name=MDSH66/><ref name=MDSH67>{{cite MDOT map |year= 1967 |sections=K13<U+2013>K13}}</ref> and has not been used since.
