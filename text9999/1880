'''Alzheimer's disease''' ('''AD'''), also called '''Alzheimer disease''' or simply '''Alzheimer's''', is the most common form of [[dementia]]. This incurable, [[degenerative disease|degenerative]] and [[Terminal illness|terminal disease]] was first described by German psychiatrist [[Al<U+00F6>is Alzheimer]] in 1901.

The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood.  Research indicates that the disease is associated with [[Senile plaques|plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangles|tangles]] in the [[brain]].<ref name="pmid15184601"/> Currently used treatments offer a small symptomatic benefit; no treatments to delay or halt the progression of the disease are as yet available. As of 2008, more than 500 [[clinical trials]] were investigating possible treatments for AD, but it is unknown if any of them will prove successful.<ref>{{cite web

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions.

[[Image:TANGLES HIGH.jpg|right|thumb|In Alzheimer's disease, changes in tau protein lead to the disintegration of microtubules in brain cells.]]

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]]. Healthy neurons have a [[cytoskeleton]], an internal support structure partly made up of structures called [[microtubules]]. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the [[axon]] and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], and is therefore called a [[microtubule-associated protein]]. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming [[Hyperphosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]]; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.<ref name="pmid17604998">{{cite journal

Three major competing hypotheses exist to explain the cause of the disease. The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the [[cholinergic]] hypothesis and suggests that AD is due to reduced synthesis of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]]. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support due to the reduced efficacy of medications that treat acetylcholine deficiency, although cholinergic effects have been proposed to initiate large-scale aggregation,<ref name="pmid15236795">{{cite journal

==Management==
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain [[palliative care|palliative]] in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving. 

===Pharmaceutical===

[[Image:Memantine.svg|right|thumb||Upright|Molecular structure of [[memantine]], a medication approved for advanced AD symptoms]]
Four medications are currently approved by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) to treat the cognitive manifestations of AD: three are [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s and the other is [[memantine]], an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].

Emotion-oriented interventions include [[reminiscence therapy]], [[validation therapy]], supportive [[psychotherapy]], sensory integration, also called  [[snoezelen]], and [[simulated presence therapy]]. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired patients adjust to their illness.<ref name="pracGuideAPA"/> Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for [[cognition]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]].<ref name="pmid15846613">{{cite journal

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|cognitive retraining]], is the reduction of [[cognitive deficit]]s. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his place in them. On the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities.

Stimulation-oriented treatments include [[Art therapy|art]], [[Music therapy|music]] and [[Animal-assisted therapy|pet]] therapies, [[Physical therapy|exercise]], and any other kind of [[Recreational therapy|recreational activities]].

===Caregiving===
{{Further|[[Caregiving and dementia]]}}

Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving essentially is the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.

During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden.<ref name="pmid11220813">{{cite journal

==Prognosis==
The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. He will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living.<ref name="pmid10653284" />

Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is  the number of new cases per unit of person-time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person-years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at a given time.

Regarding incidence, [[cohort study|cohort]] [[longitudinal studies]] (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10<U+2013>15 per thousand person-years for all dementias and 5<U+2013>8 for AD,<ref name="pmid12028245">{{cite journal

Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the [[United States]], Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in the year 2000. In the 65<U+2013>74 age group, approximately 5% of the U.S. population has AD, with the rate increasing to nearly 20% in the 75<U+2013>84 group and to 50% in the greater than 84 group.<ref>{{cite journal

==Research directions==
 
{{Main|Alzheimer's disease clinical research}}

As of 2008, the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments are being investigated in [[clinical trial]]s worldwide, and approximately one-fourth of these compounds are in [[Phase III]] trials, which is the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies.<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=alzheimer
 |title= Clinical Trials. Found 459 studies with search of: alzheimer
 |accessdate= 2008-03-23
 |publisher= US National Institutes of Health
}}</ref>

One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of [[amyloid beta]] levels is a common target of compounds under investigation. [[Immunotherapy]] or [[vaccination]] for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease.<ref>Vaccination:
