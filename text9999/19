Daoist sexual practices (Simplified Chinese: <U+5408><U+6C14>, Traditional Chinese: <U+5408><U+6C23>, pinyin: heqi) or <U+2018>The Joining of the Essences,<U+2019> is the way Daoists practiced sex. The Daoists believed that by practicing these sexual arts, one could stay in good health, and eventually attain immortality. 

==History==

The first sexual texts that survive today are those found at the [[Mawangdui]] tombs. While Daoism had not yet fully evolved as a philosophy at this time, these texts share some remarcable similarities will later [[Tang dynasty]] texts, such as the [[Ishimpo]]. The sexual arts arguably reached their peak in between the end of the [[Han dynasty]] and the end of the Tang dynasty. After 1000 CE, Confucian puritanism became stronger and stronger, so that by the advent of the Qing dynasty, sex was a taboo topic. These Confucians alleged that the separation of sexes existed two thousand years ago, and suppressed the sexual arts. Because of the taboo surrounding sex, there was much censoring done during the Qing in literature, and the sexual arts died off. As a result, many of the texts survived only in [[Japan]], and scholars had no idea that such a different concept of sex existed in early China.

==Principles==

===Qi (Lifeforce)===
The basis of all Daoist thinking is that [[qi]] is part of everything that exists. Humans are born with only a finite amount of qi, and once all the qi has been lost, you will die. Qi could be lost from the body in a variety of ways, but was lost mostly through bodily fluids. Daoists would try to avoid losing as much bodily fluid as possible, and would sometimes recycle and compost their own fecal matter.<ref>Wile (1992), p. 6.</ref> The fluid that contained the most qi was male semen. Therefore the Daoists believed that men should avoid ejaculation in order to conserve their life essence.

===Male Control of Ejaculation===
Many Daoist practitioners link the loss of ejaculatory fluids to the loss of vital life force, where excessive fluid loss results in premature aging, disease, and general fatigue.  The more extreme Daoists contend that one should never [[ejaculate]], where others provide a specific formula to determine the maximum amount of regular [[ejaculations]].  The general idea is to limit the loss of fluids as much as possible to the level of your desired practice.  
As these sexual practices evolved over the centuries, the emphasis on limiting ejaculation became less important. Nevertheless, the 'retention of the semen' was one of the foundational tenets of Daoist sexual practice.

There are different methods to control ejaculation prescribed by the Daoists. In order to avoid ejaculation, the man could two things. He could pull out immediately before orgasm, a method which [[Joseph Needham]] termed "coitus conservatus." The second method involved the man applying pressure on an area between the scrotum and the anus, and cause a retrograde ejaculation into the bladder. Needham called this method "coitus interruptus."

===Jing (Sexual Energy)===
Another important concept of 'The Joining of the Essences' was that the union of a man and a woman would result in the creation of [[Jing (TCM)|jing]], a type of sexual energy. When in the act of lovamaking, jing would form, and the man could transform some of this jing into qi, and replenish his lifeforce. By having as much sex as possible, men had the opportunity to transform more and more jing, and as a result would see many health benefits.

===Yin/Yang===

The concept of [[Yin and yang|Yin/yang]] is important in Daoism, and consequently also holds special importance in sex. Yang usually referred to the male gender, whereas Yin could refer to the female gender. Man and Woman were the equivalent of heaven and earth, but became disconnected. Therefore while heaven and earth are eternal, man and woman suffer a premature death. Every interaction between Yin and Yang had significance. Because of this significance, every position and action in lovemaking had importance. This resulted in a huge amount of special sexual positions being described in Daoist texts that serve to cure or prevent illness.

==The Position of Women==

For Daoists, sex was not just about pleasing the man, but the woman also had to be pleased in order to benefit from the act of sex. Sex could only happen if both partners desired it. If sex was performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb it to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the Ishimpo, with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women had a great deal of strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation. 

Yet, women were still given a position of inferiority in sexual practice. Men were encouraged to not limit themselves to one woman, and were advised only have sex with a woman who was beautiful and had not had children. While the man had to please the woman sexually, she was still just an object. At numerous points during the Ishimpo, the woman is referred to as the <U+2018>enemy.<U+2019> This was because part of the act of intercourse was to assume dominance of the woman<U+2019>s sexual prowess. He did this by retaining the semen. Each time he successfully practice this, he affirmed his strength over the woman. In later sexual texts from the Ming, women had lost all semblance of being human and were referred to as the <U+2018>other, <U+2018>crucible<U+2019> or <U+2018>stove.<U+2019> The importance of pleasing the woman also diminished in later texts. 

Women were also considered to be a means for men to extend their lives. Many of the ancient texts were dedicated to how a man could use sex to extend his own life. But, his life was only extended through the absorption of the woman<U+2019>s vital energies (jing and qi). Daoists called the act of sex <U+201C>The battle of stealing and strengthening.<U+201D><ref>Wile (1992), p. 11.</ref> These sexual methods could be correlated with Daoist military methods. Instead of storming the gates, the battle was a series of feints and maneuvers that would sap the enemy<U+2019>s resistance.

==When and Where to have Sex==

The Ishimpo is very clear that certain times were better for intercourse than others. A person had to avoid having intercourse on quarter or full moons and days when there were great winds, rain, fog, cold or heat, thunder, lightning, darkness over heaven and earth, solar and lunar eclipses, rainbows and earthquakes. Having intercourse at these times would harm a man<U+2019>s spirit and causes women to become ill. Children conceived at these times will be mad, stupid, perverse or foolish; mute, deaf, crippled or blind; unfilial and violent. 

Also important was selecting the right day for intercourse if a person desired children. After the woman<U+2019>s period, the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on these days the man ejaculated after midnight, the child would likely be male. If a female child is desired, the man sneeded to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's period.

The location of sex was also important. People had to avoid the glare of the sun, moon or stars, the interior of shrines, proximity to Buddhist temples, wells, stoves and privies, and the vicinity to graves or coffins.

If these suggestions were followed the family's offspring would be good, wise and virtuous. If they were not followed, the offspring would be evil and stupid, and the family would eventually die off.

==Modern Practices==

While the ancient sexual arts died out, a surge of new interest in Daoist sexual practice has led modern-day practitioners to develop new exercises based on the old arts. Some of these exercises include variants on Kegel exercises, that involve the strengthening of the pelvic muscles. In addition, some modern health practitioners have advocated a modern-day version of 'coitus interruptus' that involves pressing the perineum and causing a retrograde ejaculation. Eventually through practice, men are supposedly able to avoid ajaculation all together and experience more powerful orgasms without any fluid loss or down time.

There is little evidence to support the health claims of this practice.  The debate is somewhat controversial because of the lack of proper research.  The opponents to these practices claim that they may be unhealthy (particularly the application of pressure on the perineum to prevent ejaculation) -- possibly inherently, but especially if done incorrectly.  One criticism is the occurrence of [[retrograde ejaculation]], where the ejaculatory fluids actually end up in the [[urinary bladder]], to be [[urine|urinated]] out shortly after the [[erection]] subsides.  Although the health risks associated with retrograde ejaculation are rare, it is improper practice if nothing else and can be easily avoided.  Another claim against the practice of withholding ejaculation is that the pressure from the force of ejaculation (the contractions of the [[prostate]] gland), can actually cause damage to the [[urethra]], [[vas deferens]], or other parts of the [[reproductive system]] by sudden force against the valves designed to be one way.  Both of these claims have little research to back them, as do the claims of the modern-day Daoists.  The modern-day Daoists use experience as the grounds of their research, with their practices evolving over generations of practioners.  Western culture in general overlooks subjective data because it is not repeatable or controllable. More controlled studies may be needed on the subject to support or provide evidence for or against the health claims about this practice.
