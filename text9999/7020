The '''Joint Expedition Against Franklin''' was a joint engagement between the [[Union Army|United States Army]] & [[Union Navy|Navy]] and the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].  The engagement was intended to move Union forces into an area where confederate forces were gathering as they prepared to move on Suffolk, Virginia.  Originally planned as a coordinated two-pronged attack with a Naval flotilla supporting an infantry advance on [[Franklin, Virginia]], communications delays caused the Navy to depart for the mission which the Army was not yet supporting.  Instead, {{start date|1862|10|03}} found Union Naval forces on the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater River]] greatly outnumbered by Confederate infantrymen and ultimately forced to retreat.  The naval action alone is also known as the '''Action at Crumpler's Bluff''' or the '''Battle of Crumpler's Bluff'''.<ref name="dfai">{{cite web

Simultaneously, a nearby Army reconnaissance team conducted a failed assault on the town on the basis that the audibly nearby Naval forces<U+2014>which they did not know were then in retreat<U+2014>would bring support.  The outcome left the Union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded.  Dialogue between officers following the conflict left the Union navy questioning the usefulness of gun boats in joint expedition settings in which they would not be capable of supporting themselves.

==The conflict==
===Background===
Receiving orders early September 12th, 1862, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]]'s [[4th North Carolina Cavalry| 4th North Carolina (NC) Cavalry]] immediately proceeded from [[Garysburg, North Carolina]] to [[Franklin, Virginia]], arriving late the next day.  There, the 4th NC Cavalry, under the command of a [[Colonel (United States)#19th Century colonels|Colonel]] Dennis Dozier Ferebee, was joined by the [[52nd North Carolina Infantry]], [[Edward Graham (American)|Edward Graham]]'s [[Petersburg Artillery]] and (two weeks later) the [[11th North Carolina Infantry]].  The 4th NC Cavalry's first major assignment was to construct a [[floating bridge]] across the nearby [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater River]] to replace the [[Roanoke and Seaboard Railroad]] bridge<ref name="19951006May" /> and thereby facilitate the eastward transfer of men and equipment into Franklin; Col. Ferebee reported the bridge finished on the 18th.<ref name="4NCC">{{cite book

A small [[Union Army]] [[cavalry]] force was stationed in nearby [[Suffolk, Virginia]] under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[John J. Peck]].  On September 23rd, Peck sent [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Samuel P. Spear]] to reconnoiter Franklin and the Confederates therein.

Acting on Union [[Picket (military)|picket]] intelligence of the Confederate's position in Franklin, both Generals Peck and Dix felt that it would be wiser to wait on the joint assault.<ref name="4NCC" />  Unfortunately, because Dix's messenger arrived five hours late, Commander Flusser never received the word the former's forces were delaying "until about the 10th".  Peck did however order a [[reconnaissance mission]] be undertaken in the area; at 9:00 p.m. on October 2nd, Colonel Spear left Suffolk with 1,300 soldiers, one [[Artillery]] section, and orders to survey Franklin and determine the extent of the Confederate forces south of Suffolk.<ref name="19951006May" /><ref name="Official106-107" /><ref name="4NCC" />

The evening of the 2nd of October, Confederate pickets observed the three riverboats waiting around [[South Quay, Virginia]], approximately {{convert|3|mi}} downriver from Franklin.<ref name="4NCC" /><ref name="Official108-110" />  At 5:45 a.m. the next day, the three ships began moving towards the city while shelling the nearby banks.  The attack was led by the ''Commodore Perry'', followed by the ''Whitehead'' astern the ''Hunchback''.<ref name="Official108-110">{{cite book

}}</ref>  While the Union shelled the banks of the Blackwater, Confederate troops began distributing themselves along the riverside to take advantage of the concealment there.  Some of the 4th North Carolina Cavalry was dismounted and taken up by [[James K. Marshall|Colonel Marshall]] of the 52nd, and positioned along with his men at [[Crumpler's Bluff|Crumpler's]] and neighboring [[bluff]]s to fire upon the riverboats.  Colonel Ferebee took the rest of the 4th NC Cavalry and dismounted and positioned them behind the trees and bushes along the banks of the Blackwater, under the command of a Lieutenant Ruffin.<ref name="4NCC" />  According to a Union naval officer later, the Confederate's forces along the Blackwater also included "some nonuniformed [[irregular military|irregulars]] and even 'some [[negro]]es.'"<ref name="Southampton" />

At 7:00 a.m., approximately {{convert|.75|mi}} from Franklin, the ''Commodore Perry'' came under fire from the Confederate forces along the river and atop the bluffs.  As the ''Perry'' was too close to bring her large-bore guns to bear, Commander Flusser ordered his sailors to shelter themselves as best they could while the ship tried to steam past the enemy.  Unfortunately, due to the narrowness of the bend, the ''Commodore Perry'' [[Ship grounding|ran aground]];<ref name="Official108-110" /> Lt. Ruffin and his men were so close to the grounded riverboat, they later claimed to have heard the ''Perry''{{'}}s officers [[expletive|cursing]] her enlisted sailors.<ref name="4NCC" />  Freeing herself, the ''Perry'' rounded the bend and maneuvered to provide [[suppressive fire]] to allow the ''Hunchback'' and ''Whitehead'' to follow;<ref name="Official108-110" /> the combined shelling of all three ships forced Lt. Ruffin and his detachment to withdraw from the banks of the river.<ref name="4NCC" />  However, all three ships' progress was soon halted by a [[barricade]] in the river.  While the barricade was removable with Commander Flusser's available manpower, he could not attempt to do so due to the "terrible fire to which [they] were exposed."  While continuing to assault the Confederacy with their "IX-inch [[grapeshot|grape]] and shell" guns, "[[32-pounder]]" guns, field gun, and [[musket]]s, the three ships waited at the barricade hoping to hear the gunfire of General Dix's infantry forces.<ref name="Official108-110" />

At 10:15 a.m., Commander Flusser ordered retreat from the river barrier.  All three ships remained under heavy fire by enemy forces from multiple angles until between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m.<ref name="Official112" /><ref name="4NCC" />  An incomplete rear barricade of felled trees failed to stop the ships which "[pushed through] with a heavy head of steam."<ref name="Official108-110" />  Flusser later opined that this new barricade would have been impassible had the ships remained north of it for several more hours, waiting for the General Dix's quiescent forces.<ref name="Official112" />

Meanwhile, Colonel Spear arrived around 1:00 p.m. and anticipating support from the now-retreating naval gunships, the Union infantrymen conflicted with the Confederates in Franklin.  After six hours of combat, running low on ammunition, realizing that he only had 1,300 men and not the 1,700&mdash;2,000 he'd thought,<ref name="4NCC" /> and losing two [[rifleman|riflemen]] to Confederate [[defection]], Spear withdrew the Union forces around Franklin, and returned to Suffolk leaving behind one [[brass]] [[field artillery|field piece]], a few [[overcoat]]s, and a [[horse]].<ref name="19951006May" /><ref name="Official106-107" /><ref name="4NCC" />

===Aftermath===
Upon return to Ablemarle Sound, Commander Flusser sent the ''Hunchback'' on to Plymouth to bury their dead sailors; at [[Roanoke Island]], Flusser was lent the [[USS Emily|USS ''Emily'']] to carry the wounded to [[Norfolk Hospital]].<ref name="Official108-110" />

==Outcome==
The Confederate forces around Franklin held back the Navy and ultimately forced them, and the Army reconnaissance team, to retreat.  While the Union Navy lost no ships, they suffered four casualties and 15 wounded; the Army suffered one fatality and six wounded, although General Dix believed the infantry to have robbed the enemy of 70&ndash;100 in return.<ref name="Official104" /><ref name="Official106-107">{{cite book
