'''Congregation Beth Israel''' is an egalitarian<ref name=Mission/> [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[synagogue]] located at 6880 North Green Bay Road in [[Glendale, Wisconsin]], a suburb north of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]].

Originally founded in 1884 as '''Congregation B'ne Jacob''', the congregation split, re-amalgamated, and went bankrupt before re-organizing as Beth Israel in 1901.<ref name=history/> The synagogue building it constructed on Teutonia Avenue in 1925, and sold in 1959, was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.<ref name=history/><ref name=NRHPStateMilwaukee/>

Led by Rabbi Jacob Haber, as of 2008 it is the only synagogue in Milwaukee associated with the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=homepage/>

==Early years==
In 1884 the '''Congregation B'ne Jacob''' was formed in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. By 1886 it had split into two congregations, '''Moses Montefiore Gemeinde''' and '''Anshe Jacob'''. In 1891 they re-amalgamated, creating '''Beth Hamedrash Hagadol''', and the following year hired Solomon Isaac Scheinfeld as the congregation's first permanent rabbi.<ref name=history>[http://www.cbimilwaukee.org/content.php?I=53 History], Synagogue website.</ref> Scheinfeld had been born in [[Lithuania]] in 1860, and had moved to Milwaukee soon after receiving ''[[semicha]]'' in 1890.<ref name=Hintz65>[[#refHintz2005|Hintz (2005)]], p. 65.</ref> He would stay less than a year before moving to [[Kentucky]].<ref name=history/>

The congregation completed a new synagogue building at 462 Fifth Street in 1893, but was unable to afford the mortgage, and in 1900 the courts foreclosed on the property. The following year the congregation was re-organized as '''Congregation Beth Israel''' and re-acquired the synagogue building on Fifth Street, and in 1902 Scheinfeld was re-hired as rabbi.<ref name=history/> He would go on to serve as Beth Israel's rabbi until his death in 1943.<ref name=Hintz65/>

During his tenure as rabbi, Scheinfeld established a ''maot chitim'' (literally "money for wheat") fund, to provide for the needs of Milwaukee Jews too poor to afford food for the [[Passover Seder]]. That fund continued after his death as the "Rabbi Solomon I. Scheinfeld Moath Chitim Fund", and in 2003 distributed $20,000 worth of food to 600 families.<ref name=Cohen2003>[[#refCohen2003|Cohen (2003)]].</ref>

==Teutonia building==
Beth Israel sold its Fifth Street building in 1924, and, after meeting in temporary quarters for a year, constructed a new building at 2432 North Teutonia Avenue.<ref name=history/><ref name=NRHPStateMilwaukee>[[#refNRHPStateMilwaukee|NRHP State listings: WISCONSIN - Milwaukee County]].</ref> However, as the Jewish community of Milwaukee migrated north to suburbs in the 1940s and 1950s, the location became inconvenient. In 1957, a 15 acre property was purchased at 6880 North Green Bay Road in [[Glendale, Wisconsin|Glendale]], a suburb north of Milwaukee, and construction began on new facilities there in 1959.<ref name=JTS>[http://www.jtsa.edu/x5132.xml Congregation Beth Israel, Milwaukee, Wisconsin records], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] website.</ref> The Tuetonia Avenue building was sold in 1959, and vacated in 1960.<ref name=history/> On March 5, 1992 it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=NRHPStateMilwaukee/>

==Move from Orthodox to Conservative Judaism==
Beth Israel was originally founded as an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and its rabbi, Solomon Scheinfeld, also served as chief rabbi of the United Orthodox Congregations of Milwaukee.<ref name=Hintz65/> However, the congregation had done away with [[mehitza|separate seating for men and women]] in 1920s or 30s; at the same time Beth Israel also instituted [[English language]] sermons.<ref name=mixedseating>According to [http://www.jtsa.edu/x5132.xml Congregation Beth Israel, Milwaukee, Wisconsin records], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] website, this happened in 1926. According to [http://www.cbimilwaukee.org/content.php?I=53 History], Synagogue website, in 1937 "[[High Holiday]] English Services [were] instituted, with mixed seating allowed."</ref> The congregation would eventually become fully egalitarian,<ref name=Mission>[http://www.cbimilwaukee.org/content.php?I=48 Mission Statement], Synagogue website.</ref> and associate with the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=homepage/>

==1960s to 1990s==
Beth Israel's current facilities were built in three phases.<ref name=JTS/> In 1962 a new school building was completed, and the congregation began holding services there. In 1966, the sanctuary building and social hall were completed and dedicated, and in 1980 work on the sanctuary was completed.<ref name=history/>

In 1970, Herbert Panitch joined Beth Israel from Congregation Agudath Achim in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]]. He would serve as rabbi until his retirement in 1995.<ref name=RubinSchwartz264>[[#refRubinSchwartz2006|Rubin Schwartz (2006)]], p. 264, footnote 107.</ref><ref name=Sandin1995>[[#refSandin1995|Sandin (1995)]].</ref>

==Recent events==
Jacob Herber, a graduate of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[University of California, Davis]], became rabbi of Beth Israel in August 2003.<ref name=Clergy>[http://www.cbimilwaukee.org/content.php?I=44 Meet the Clergy], Synagogue website.</ref> Funded by congregation members and the Milwaukee Jewish Federation, he traveled to [[Uganda]] in July 2008 to assist in the [[Abayudaya]] in [[Conversion to Judaism|converting to Judaism]].<ref name=Heinen20080705>[[#refHeinen20080705|Heinen (2008)]].</ref>

As of 2008, Beth Israel is the only synagogue in Milwaukee associated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism,<ref name=homepage>[http://www.cbimilwaukee.org/ Synagogue website].</ref> and currently has 700 member families.<ref name=members>[http://www.thi-milwaukee.org/members.html What is THI], Tikkun Ha-Ir of Milwaukee website.</ref> The rabbi is Jacob Herber, the rabbi emeritus is Herbert Panitch, the [[hazzan|cantor]] is Mitchell Martin, and the president is Ralph Schapira.<ref name=Contacts>[http://www.cbimilwaukee.org/content.php?I=55 Contacts], Synagogue website.</ref>
