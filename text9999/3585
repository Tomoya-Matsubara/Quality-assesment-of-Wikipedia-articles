The '''Belgian Eifel''' ({{lang-de|belgische Eifel}}) is that part of the [[North Eifel|North]] and [[West Eifel]] that lies on the [[Belgian]] side of the Germany-Belgium border. The term is not universally used, because the boundary between the Eifel and the [[Ardennes]] in the area of the [[High Fens]] is not clearly defined.

The following areas may be considered part of the Belgian Eifel:
* Part of the [[Zitterwald]] (western section of the [[North Eifel]]), where this upland area runs into Belgium towards  [[B<U+00FC>tgenbach]]
* The westernmost part of the [[Schnee Eifel]] (Ommerwald) and the German-speaking area around [[Sankt Vith]]
* The [[Hohes Venn]] (''Hautes Fagnes''), although this can be considered part of the [[Ardennes]]
* Geologically and geographically the [[Eupen Land]] can also be counted as part of the [[Eifel]], even if its inhabitants would not class themselves as living within it.
* A small part of the [[<U+00D6>sling]] (hill country in northern [[Luxembourg]]).
