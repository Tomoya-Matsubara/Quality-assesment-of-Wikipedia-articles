'''''Persoonia levis''''', commonly known as the '''broad-leaved geebung''', is a [[shrub]] native to [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in eastern Australia. It reaches 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) in height and has dark grey papery bark and bright green asymmetrical sickle-shaped leaves up to 14&nbsp;cm (5.5&nbsp;in) long and 8&nbsp;cm (3.2&nbsp;in) wide. The small yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), followed by small green fleshy fruit known as [[drupe]]s. Within the genus ''[[Persoonia]]'', it is a member of the ''Lanceolata'' group of 58 closely related species.  ''P.&nbsp;levis'' interbreeds with several other species where they grow together.

Found in dry [[sclerophyll]] forest on [[sandstone]]-based nutrient-deficient soils, ''P.&nbsp;levis'' is adapted to a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] from beneath their thick bark after [[bushfire]]s, and can live for over 60&nbsp;years. Regeneration also takes place after fire by a [[Soil seed bank|ground-stored seed bank]].  The longtongue bee ''[[Leioproctus carinatifrons]]'' is a [[pollinator]] of the flowers, and the fruit are consumed by vertebrates such as [[kangaroo]]s, [[possum]]s and [[currawong]]s. Despite its horticultural appeal, ''P.&nbsp;levis'' is rare in [[horticulture|cultivation]] as it is very hard to [[Plant propagation|propagate]], either by seed or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]].

==Taxonomy and classification==
First collected by [[Luis N<U+00E9>e]] in the vicinity of [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney) in April 1797, ''Persoonia levis'' was described and given the name ''Linkia levis'' by [[Antonio Jos<U+00E9> Cavanilles]] in 1798,<ref name="cav1798"/><ref name="APNI:Linkia levis"/> before being placed in the genus ''[[Persoonia]]'' by [[Karel Domin]] in 1921.<ref name="APNI:Persoonia levis"/> The genus names ''Linkia'' and ''Persoonia'' had been coined in 1798, but the latter was officially [[nomen conservandum|conserved]].<ref name=wrigley/> The [[Botanical name|species name]] is the [[Latin]] adjective ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:levis|levis]]}}'', meaning "smooth", and refers to the hairless foliage.<ref name=wrigley/> [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] coined the name ''Persoonia salicina'' for it in his 1805 work ''Synopsis Plantarum'', and queried whether Cavanilles' ''Linkia levis'' was in fact ''[[Persoonia lanceolata|P.&nbsp;lanceolata]]''.<ref name=Persoon1805/><ref name="APNI:Persoonia salicina"/> [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] used Persoon's name in his 1810 work ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]'', and echoed Persoon's thoughts on Cavanilles' original name and specimen.<ref name="R.Br. 1810"/> In the 1995 ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' revision of the genus, Peter Weston reviewed the mounted material of ''Linkia levis'', and found that Cavanilles had mounted material from both ''P.&nbsp;levis'' and ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata''. He set one specimen of the three, which was clearly ''P.&nbsp;levis'', as the [[lectotype]], which aligned the material with the [[Species description|description]].<ref name=FoA/>  Common names include broad-leaved geebung, willow geebung and smooth geebung.<ref name="APNI:Persoonia levis"/> The term geebung is derived from the [[Sydney language|Dharug]] language word ''geebung''.<ref name=apu/>

Like most other members of the genus, ''Persoonia levis'' has seven [[chromosome]]s that are large compared to those of other Proteaceae.<ref name=Ramsay1963/> In 1870, [[George Bentham]] published the first [[wikt:infrageneric|infrageneric]] arrangement of ''Persoonia'' in Volume 5 of his landmark ''[[Flora Australiensis]]''. He divided the genus into three [[taxonomic section|section]]s, placing ''P.&nbsp;levis'' (which he called ''P.&nbsp;salicina'') in ''P.''&nbsp;sect. ''Amblyanthera''.<ref name="Bentham 1870"/> The 1995 ''Flora of Australia'' revision of the genus saw it classified in the ''Lanceolata'' group, a group of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur,<ref name=weston03/> and [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with ''[[Persoonia acerosa|P.&nbsp;acerosa]]'', ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata'', ''[[Persoonia linearis|P.&nbsp;linearis]]'', ''[[Persoonia mollis|P.&nbsp;mollis]]'' subsp. ''ledifolia'', ''[[Persoonia myrtilloides|P.&nbsp;myrtilloides]]'' subsp. ''myrtilloides'' (in the Upper [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], these plants resemble ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata''<ref name=wrigley/>), ''[[Persoonia oxycoccoides|P.&nbsp;oxycoccoides]]'', and ''[[Persoonia stradbrokensis|P.&nbsp;stradbrokensis]]'' have been recorded.<ref name=FoA/> Robert Brown initially described the hybrid with ''P.&nbsp;linearis'' as a species "''Persoonia lucida''",<ref name=wrigley/> which is now known as ''Persoonia <U+00D7> lucida'',<ref name="APNI:Persoonia x lucida"/> and has been recorded from the southeast forests of the New South Wales south coast.<ref name=Keith1999/>

==Description==
[[File:Persoonia levis bark 3.jpg|thumb|left|Flaky bark, with reddish layers beneath]]
''Persoonia levis'' grows as a tall shrub to small tree, and can reach 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) in height. The flaky soft [[bark]] is dark grey on the surface,<ref name=FoA/> while deeper layers are reddish in colour.<ref name=Fairley/> Within the bark are [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]], which sprout new growth after bushfire.<ref name=weston03/> The new growth is smooth to slightly hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14&nbsp;cm (2.2<U+2013>5.5&nbsp;in) in length, and 1.3 to 8&nbsp;cm (0.5<U+2013>3.2&nbsp;in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate).<ref name=FoA/> The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from ''P.&nbsp;lanceolata''.<ref name=Fairley/> The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands out against the more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April),<ref name=FoA/><ref name=Fairley/> and peak over December to February.<ref name=Benson2000/> They are arranged on short axillary [[raceme]]s along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical [[perianth]], consisting of [[tepal]]s fused for most of their length, within which are both male and female parts. The central [[Gynoecium#The_stigma_and_style|style]] is surrounded by the [[anther]], which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above.<ref name=weston03/> They provide a landing area for insects attending to the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]], which is located at the tip of the style.<ref name=wrigley/> The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a [[drupe]], is green and more or less round, measuring 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;in) by 0.8&nbsp;cm (0.3&nbsp;in) in diameter.<ref name=EJ97/> It contains two seeds,<ref name=wrigley/> and has a spike at the end.<ref name=Smith99/> The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.<ref name=Smith99/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Persoonia levis habit4 grnp.jpg|right|thumb|[[Habit (biology)|Habit]], in open woodland, [[Georges River National Park]]]]
''Persoonia levis'' is found from the [[Macleay River]] catchment on the New South Wales [[Mid North Coast|mid north coast]] to the [[Cann River]] in far eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. It is found in dry sclerophyll forest on [[sandstone]]-based nutrient-deficient soils, from sea level to an altitude of 1000&nbsp;m (3500&nbsp;ft).<ref name=FoA/> There it grows in sunny or lightly shaded areas in open woodland, associated with such trees as ''[[Eucalyptus piperita]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus sieberi|E.&nbsp;sieberi]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus sclerophylla|E.&nbsp;sclerophylla]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus radiata|E.&nbsp;radiata]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus smithii|E.&nbsp;smithii]]'', ''[[Angophora costata]]'' and ''[[Corymbia gummifera]]'', and shrubs such as ''[[Conospermum longifolium]]'', ''[[Grevillea buxifolia]]'', ''[[Grevillea phylicoides|G.&nbsp;phylicoides]]'', ''[[Hakea laevipes]]'', ''[[Symphionema montanum]]'' and ''[[Telopea speciosissima]]'', as well as ''[[Persoonia hirsuta]]'' and ''P.&nbsp;mollis''.<ref name=Benson2000/> Coastal forms are smaller with broader leaves than inland forms.<ref name=EJ97/> The annual rainfall of the area it occurs in the [[Sydney Basin]] is {{convert|900|<U+2013>|1400|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Benson2000/> It is considered adequately protected in the Sydney region, and is found in [[Georges River National Park|Georges River]], [[Cattai National Park|Cattai]],<ref name=OoEH/> [[Wollemi National Park|Wollemi]], [[Bouddi National Park|Bouddi]], [[Brisbane Water National Park|Brisbane Water]], [[Marramarra National Park|Marramarra]], [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park|Ku-ring-gai Chase]], [[Garigal National Park|Garigal]], [[Lane Cove National Park|Lane Cove]], [[Sydney Harbour National Park|Sydney Harbour]], [[Botany Bay National Park|Botany Bay]] and [[Budderoo National Park]]s.<ref name=Benson2000/>

==Ecology==
''Persoonia levis'' is one of several species of ''Persoonia'' that regenerate by resprouting from the trunk after [[bushfire]], an adaptation to the [[Fire ecology|fire-prone]] habitat in which it grows. Its thick papery bark shields the underlying [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] from the flames.<ref name=weston03/> Plants also regenerate by seedlings that arise from a seedbank in the soil after fire, although they may take up to 12&nbsp;months to germinate.<ref name=Benson2000/> One study of [[sclerophyll]] forest unburnt for thirty years showed ''P.&nbsp;levis'' had declined over time.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1071/BT09079}}</ref> ''P.&nbsp;levis'' plants can live for over 60&nbsp;years,<ref name=Benson2000/> and their leaves have a lifespan of up to 6&nbsp;years.<ref name=Wright2001/>

Vesicles indicating a [[mycorrhiza]]l association have been found on the roots of ''Persoonia levis'', the Proteaceae not previously noted for forming mycorrhizal associations.<ref name=Bellgard1991/> Infection by the fungal species ''[[Anthracostroma persooniae]]'' results in leaf spot disease.<ref name=Benson2000/>  ''P.&nbsp;levis'' is the food plant of the larvae of the [[weevil]] species ''[[Eurhynchus laevior]]''.<ref name=Oberprieler2000/>

[[Colletidae|Colletid]] bees of the genus ''[[Leioproctus]]'' subgenus ''[[Cladocerapis]]'' exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of ''Persoonia''. Bees of subgenus ''[[Filiglossa]]'' in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on ''Persoonia'' flowers do not appear to be effective pollinators.<ref name=weston03/> Particular species recorded on ''P.&nbsp;levis'' include the longtongue bee ''[[Leioproctus carinatifrons]]''.<ref name=Benson2000/> Weighing 1700&nbsp;mg (0.60&nbsp;oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as [[kangaroo]]s and [[possum]]s, as well as [[currawong]]s and other large birds.<ref name=Benson2000/> The flowers of ''P.&nbsp;levis'' are [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]]<U+2014>that is, they are unable to [[Fertilisation#Fertilisation in plants|fertilise]] themselves and require [[outcrossing]] to another plant.<ref name=Nancarrow2006/>

==Cultivation==
''Persoonia levis'' is rarely seen in [[horticulture|cultivation]], mainly due to difficulties in [[Plant propagation|propagation]]; seed [[germination]] is unpredictable, and [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]] have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation.<ref name=wrigley/> Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions.<ref name=EJ97/> [[Plantsman|Plantsmen]] germinated seed in England as early as 1795.<ref name=wrigley/>
