Eight [[distillery|distilleries]] and a [[cooperage]] form the '''Malt Whisky Trail''' in Scotland's [[Speyside]]. The route is well-marked at the roadside at various points and the distilleries can be visited in any convenient order. Some are popular with coach parties, but others are more esoteric. A tour of [[Cragganmore]] for example requires prior booking via the [[Cardhu]] distillery visitors' centre.

There are many more Speyside distilleries not on the trail, and many allow visitors to tour the production areas. However, the trail makes a good starting point.
