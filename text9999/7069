'''''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons''''', often referred to as '''''Captain Scarlet''''', is a 1960s British science-fiction television series produced by the [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]] company of [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]], [[John Read (producer)|John Read]] and [[Reg Hill]]. First broadcast on [[ATV Midlands]] between September 1967<ref name="Bentley, 118"/> and May 1968,<ref name="Bentley, 90">Bentley, 90.</ref> it has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.<ref name="Bentley, 119"/> Combined with [[scale model]] special effects, characters are presented in a form of [[marionette]] puppetry that the Andersons termed "[[Supermarionation]]", a technology which used internal [[solenoid]] motors to produce mouth motions [[Lip sync|synchronised]] with pre-recorded dialogue.

Set in 2068,<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/> the series charts the hostilities between [[Earth]] and a race of [[Martian]]s known as the [[Mysteron]]s. After a misunderstanding causes human astronauts to destroy their settlement, the vengeful Mysterons declare war on Earth,<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/> initiating a succession of return attacks which are countered by Spectrum, an international security organisation. Spectrum boasts the remarkable abilities of its top agent, [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]], who comes to possess the Mysteron [[Healing factor|healing power]] of "retro-metabolism". This ability to return to life after suffering fatal injury essentially makes Scarlet "indestructible".<ref group="e" name="Winged Assassin"/>

''Captain Scarlet'', the eighth of ten puppet series that the Andersons produced in the 1950s and 60s, was immediately preceded by ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and led to ''[[Joe 90]]'' and the little-seen ''[[The Secret Service]]''. In terms of visual [[aesthetic]], the series represents a departure from the style of ''Thunderbirds'' due to its use of non-[[caricature]]d marionette puppets of [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] bodily proportions.<ref name="HowsWhys"/> Re-run a number of times on British television<ref name="Bentley, 119"/><ref name="Bentley, 122"/><ref name="Bentley, 125"/> and purchased by the BBC in 1993,<ref name="Bentley, 122"/> the series has been the foundation of [[merchandising]] campaigns since its first appearance, leading to the release of items such as toy [[doll]]s<ref name="Marketing"/> and other associated media, including novels<ref name="Titles"/> and [[comic strip]]s in the Anderson-related children's magazine, ''[[TV Century 21]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 102"/>

Compared to its antecedents, ''Captain Scarlet'' continues to be recognised as much "darker"<ref name="Cambridge"/> in tone and less orientated towards [[Children's television series|child audiences]] due to increased levels of violence and themes of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] malevolence and [[Interstellar war|interplanetary conflict]].<ref name="Lesterdemon"/> The transition in the puppet design has polarised commentators and former production personnel,<ref name="CrimeTV"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151"/><ref name="Peel, 244"/> although the series has been praised for its depiction of a multinational and [[multiethnic]] cast of characters against a backdrop of a [[utopia]]n future Earth.<ref name="Bould, 219"/><ref name="Bould, 220"/><ref name="WomenInSpace"/> Deciding to revive ''Captain Scarlet'' in the late 1990s,<ref name="Bentley, 123"/> Gerry Anderson supervised the production of a [[computer-animated]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] series, ''[[Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet]]'', which commenced broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2005.

==Plot summary==
{{Main|List of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes}}

In the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|pilot episode]], a team of ''[[Zero-X]]''<ref group="n" name="Zero-X">The ''[[Zero-X]]'' and its lander craft, the Martian Exploration Vehicle ("MEV"), had appeared in the first ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' film, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]''. Production documentation from ''Captain Scarlet'' confirms that the MEV that appears in "[[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Mysterons]]" is the same vehicle, which places this series in the same [[fictional universe]] as ''Thunderbirds'' (Bentley, 59), which is set in 2065. Spectrum personnel biographies in Bentley's ''The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet'' also place the events of ''[[Stingray (TV series)|Stingray]]'' (set in 2064) and ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' (set in 2063) in this universe (Bentley, 46<U+2013>7, 50).</ref> MEV astronauts investigate the surface of [[Mars]] in 2068 after unidentified radio signals emanating from the planet are detected on [[Earth]].<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons">{{cite episode|title=The Mysterons|episodelink=The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]]. Directed by [[Desmond Saunders]]|airdate=First broadcast 29 September 1967}} Episode 1.</ref> The source is discovered to be an extraterrestrial settlement, which is attacked and destroyed when the explorers mistake a harmless sensor device for a weapon.<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/> The inhabitants of the settlement, the [[Mysteron]]s, are [[sentient]] computers which form a [[Group mind (science fiction)|collective consciousness]] and possess partial control over [[matter]]. The Mysterons use their power of "reversing matter" to reconstruct their complex and declare that they will seek revenge on humankind for the unwarranted aggression.<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/>

Reversing matter, or "retro-metabolism",<ref group="e" name="Winged Assassin">{{cite episode|title=Winged Assassin|episodelink=Winged Assassin|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by [[Tony Barwick]].

This ability is used to conduct a "war of nerves" against Earth, which entails issuing threats against specific targets (from world leaders and [[military installation]]s to cities and continents) and then destroying and reconstructing whatever instruments are required (whether human or machine) to execute their plans. The presence of the Mysterons is indicated by two circles of green light (the "Mysteron rings") which trail over scenes of destruction and reconstruction. Although the Mysterons do on occasion manipulate events from Mars, their actions on Earth are usually performed by their replicated intermediaries.

The leading "Mysteron agent", ''Zero-X'' mission leader [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]], was killed and reconstructed in the service of the Mysterons immediately after the incident on Mars and disappeared when ''Zero-X'' returned to Earth.<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/><ref name="CBBiography">Captain Black character biography from ''The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet'' (2001), by Chris Bentley, p. 47.</ref> Spectrum, an international security organisation, created in 2067,<ref group="e" name="Flight to Atlantica">{{cite episode|title=Flight to Atlantica|episodelink=Flight to Atlantica|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Tony Barwick.

Additional aircraft include the Spectrum Passenger Jet, the two-seater Spectrum Helicopter and the Magnacopter for transporting larger numbers of people.</ref> and other resources against the Mysterons. With supreme command maintained from [[Cloudbase]], an airborne headquarters hovering at a height of 40,000&nbsp;feet (12,000&nbsp;m) above the Earth's surface,<ref group="e" name="Dangerous Rendezvous">{{cite episode|title=Dangerous Rendezvous|episodelink=Dangerous Rendezvous|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Tony Barwick.

It employs operatives of many nationalities, the most senior of which hold [[military rank]]s, are stationed on Cloudbase and answer to the [[commander-in-chief]] of Spectrum, [[Colonel White]].<ref group="n" name="CallSigns">In communications, Spectrum personnel use the call signal "SIG" ("'''S'''pectrum '''I'''s '''G'''reen") as their [[Voice procedure|affirmative code]]. The negative, "SIR" ("'''S'''pectrum '''I'''s '''R'''ed"), is used less often.</ref> While Cloudbase is defended by the "Angels" [[interceptor aircraft]] squadron, the organisation also boasts a fleet of [[Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle]]s ("SPVs") hidden in secret locations all over the world.

[[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] becomes Spectrum's principal weapon in its battle against the Mysterons after the events of the pilot, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the [[World government in science fiction|World President]]<ref group="n" name="Politics">In the fictional universe of ''Captain Scarlet'', power from many individual nations has been vested in a [[World government in science fiction|World Government]], which is headed by a president and operates its own military and security forces.

The rings make their first appearance in the second episode, "[[Winged Assassin]]".</ref> and replaced with a reconstruction under their control.<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/> However, when the duplicate is shot by [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] and falls to its death from a tall structure, it returns to life with Scarlet's consciousness restored and is thereafter free from the Mysteron influence.<ref group="n" name="CSBiography">Mysteron reconstructions, when killed in the television episodes, are normally permanently destroyed. The sole exception to this is Scarlet, who can die and subsequently revive. The character's biography in ''The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet'' (Bentley, 44) states that the Mysterons intended the duplicate of Scarlet to be "indestructible", unlike their other copies of deceased humans.</ref><ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/> Scarlet's ex-Mysteron body has two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity,<ref group="n" name="CSPowers">Scarlet demonstrates this ability in the episodes "Winged Assassin" (production number: 2), "[[Point 783]]" (production number: 5) and "[[Seek and Destroy (Captain Scarlet episode)|Seek and Destroy]]" (production number: 9), but no others. From the episode "[[Spectrum Strikes Back]]" (production number: 10), Scarlet is seen to be unaware of the presence of Mysteron agents when near to them.</ref> and if he is injured or killed, retro-metabolism will [[Healing factor|restore him]] to a state of perfect health. Now able to use suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons once more.<ref group="n" name="BrownIndigo">During the series, two other Spectrum officers are killed and reconstructed by the Mysterons in addition to Scarlet, but their duplicates do not possess the power of retro-metabolism: Captain Brown in "[[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Mysterons]]" and [[Captain Indigo]] in "Spectrum Strikes Back".</ref>

As Scarlet and Spectrum defend Earth against the threat from Mars, it is found that Mysteron reconstructions are particularly vulnerable to electricity<ref group="e" name="Operation Time">{{cite episode|title=Operation Time|episodelink=Operation Time|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Richard Conway and Stephen J.

The gun fires lethal beams of [[electron]]s and is seen in no other episodes. Episodes both preceding and following "Spectrum Strikes Back" portray Mysteron agents as being vulnerable to conventional means of killing such as explosions (an example of which is in the 11th produced episode, "[[Avalanche (Captain Scarlet episode)|Avalanche]]") or bullets (of which there are many examples, including the 12th produced episode, "[[Shadow of Fear]]").</ref> and the "Mysteron Detector", are developed to aid Spectrum in their fight.<ref group="e" name="Spectrum Strikes Back">{{cite episode|title=Spectrum Strikes Back|episodelink=Spectrum Strikes Back|series=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|credits=Written by Tony Barwick.

==Production==
{{Quote box|quote=I thought we should make a show about the [[Martian]]s, but then there were doubts being expressed by scientists as to whether the so-called [[Martian canal|"canals" on Mars]] were really man-made.

When talks to find an American broadcaster for ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' fell through in the July 1966, production for the series' second season ended with the completion of just six episodes at the behest of [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] financier [[Lew Grade]].<ref name="Bentley, 13">Bentley, 13.</ref> Having overseen [[Gerry Anderson]]'s work since the creation of ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'' in 1960 before going on to buy his production company, [[AP Films]], during the making of ''[[Fireball XL5]]'', Grade was keen for Anderson's programmes to be transmitted abroad and decided that a new concept would do more to attract potential bidders than a second season of ''Thunderbirds''.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/>

As a result of the cancellation, Anderson was required to come up with an idea for another [[Supermarionation]] series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character.<ref name="Bentley, 14">Bentley, 14.</ref> Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson resolved that a selling point for his new series could be a character that can be killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the beginning of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of [[life on Mars]],<ref name="Foreword">Foreword to ''The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet'' (2001), by Gerry Anderson, p. 5.</ref> led to the idea of an [[interplanetary war]] raging between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called on to defend human civilisation. After further thought, Anderson decided that "[[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]]" would make an unusual codename for this organisation's "indestructible" agent who can come back to life, while "[[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Blue]]" could be his partner's designation. From this, Anderson reasoned that all the personnel should have colours for names to form the whole "Spectrum" of colours, and decided that someone called "[[Colonel White|White]]" should be the leader of the Spectrum Organisation much in the same way that [[white light]] is composed of, and can be [[Dispersive prism|broken down into]], the colours of the [[spectrum]].<ref name="Foreword"/><ref name="DVDCommentary">{{cite video|people=[[Gerry Anderson|Anderson, Gerry]]|date=2001|title=''"[[Attack on Cloudbase]]": Audio commentary''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Carlton Communications|Carlton]]}}</ref>

Intrigued by the often-heard phrase "[[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|life as we know it]]", Anderson wanted to set the aliens of his new series apart from the conventional extraterrestrials of 1960s television and cinema. He therefore worked from a basis of "life as we ''don't'' know it",<ref name="Foreword"/> and made the [[Mysteron]]s that were to feature in the series a race of [[sentient]] computers as opposed to organic lifeforms.<ref name="Bentley, 43">Bentley, 43.</ref> Although this is not explicitly stated in the television episodes, the early intention was that the original Mysteron civilisation came from another galaxy.<ref name="Bentley, 43"/> Having established a settlement on [[Mars]] in the distant past, they fled the planet centuries later, abandoning their computer complex.<ref name="Bentley, 43"/>

Contemporary recollections of the Second World War proved to be an inspiration for a number of design aspects. For instance, Anderson recalled that [[RAF]] pilots had found it difficult to counter German attacks during the [[Battle of Britain]], since taking off from the ground meant that it took considerable time to intercept the enemy.<ref name="Teletronic">{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Laurence|title=Gerry Anderson: The Puppet Master<U+2014>Part 3|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson3.htm|work=''teletronic.co.uk''|month=October|year=2005|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080221150836/http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson3.htm|archivedate=21 February 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref> He therefore made Spectrum's headquarters an [[airborne aircraft carrier]] called "[[Cloudbase]]".<ref name="Teletronic"/> The Mysteron rings were inspired by an advertisement for the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] range of food products, which included an image of the brand name sliding over a frying pan and the outline of a woman's body.<ref name="DVDCommentary"/><ref name="Teletronic"/>

===Writing===
With a provisional series title of ''The Mysterons'',<ref name="Bentley, 15">Bentley, 15.</ref> Anderson and his wife, [[Sylvia Anderson|Sylvia]], wrote a pilot script in August 1966.<ref name="Bentley, 7">Bentley, 7.</ref> This differed significantly from the final draft of the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|pilot episode]]. Initially, it was decided that the [[Mysteron]] duplicate of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] would be artificially resurrected by an advanced Spectrum computer rather than reviving naturally, and that thereafter he would no longer be truly human but a "mechanical man" akin to an [[android]].<ref name="Bentley, 15"/> Another early ambition was for each episode to feature a guest star voiced by well-known actor of the day. To this end, the role of the [[World government in science fiction|World President]] in the pilot episode was originally intended to be voiced by the American-born actor [[Patrick McGoohan]].<ref name="Bentley, 17">Bentley, 17.</ref><ref name="Archer, 38">Archer, 38.</ref>

With Anderson serving chiefly as [[executive producer]], the majority of the writing input for ''Captain Scarlet'' was provided by [[Tony Barwick]], who had previously written for the short-lived second season of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 31">Bentley, 31.</ref> Originally given the role of [[script editor]], Barwick went on to pen 18 of the 32 episodes himself, and was also often required to make substantial changes to other writers' work.<ref name="Bentley, 31"/> While discussing his approach to writing episodes in a 1986 interview, he drew parallels between the premise and characters of ''Captain Scarlet'' and those of ''Thunderbirds'', suggesting, for example, that the Spectrum Organisation was similar to International Rescue and that the character of [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] was like the earlier recurring villain, [[The Hood (Thunderbirds)|The Hood]].<ref name="Bentley, 31"/>

===Filming===
After a two-month [[pre-production]] period lasting from November to December 1966, filming for the pilot episode, "[[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|The Mysterons]]", began on 2 January 1967,<ref name="Bentley, 22">Bentley, 22.</ref> with a budget of <U+00A3>1.5&nbsp;million for the 32-episode series.<ref name="TVHeaven">{{cite web|last1=Marcus|first1=Laurence|last2=Hulse|first2=Stephen|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'': A Television Heaven Review|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/scarlet.htm|work=''televisionheaven.co.uk''|year=2000|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080629052514/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/scarlet.htm|archivedate=29 June 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Teletronic"/> At an average cost of <U+00A3>46,000 per episode, or <U+00A3>2,000 per minute, it was the most expensive Anderson production to date.<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 119">Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', 119.</ref> A month before, Anderson and his team had dropped the name "AP Films" and renamed their company "[[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]]".<ref name="Bentley, 22"/> Many of the directors for earlier Anderson series, such as Alan Pattillo, [[David Elliott (director)|David Elliott]] and [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]], had either left AP Films or were involved in the production of ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'', the second ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' feature film, at the time that ''Captain Scarlet'' was being produced. Although [[Desmond Saunders]] and Lane were available to direct the first and second episodes, while veteran AP Films director Brian Burgess also contributed, the Andersons needed to transfer some of the more junior production personnel to replace the outgoing staff. To this effect, Alan Perry and [[Ken Turner (director)|Ken Turner]] were promoted from the camera operator and [[art department]]s.<ref name="Bentley, 32">Bentley, 32.</ref> Directors drafted in from outside AP Films were Peter Anderson, Leo Eaton and finally Robert Lynn, who had worked as an [[assistant director]] on the 1958 [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] films ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 32"/>

===Music===

Music for ''Captain Scarlet'' was composed by [[Barry Gray]], an experimenter in [[electronic music]], who had scored all the [[Supermarionation]] series preceding it. The opening [[title sequence]] theme, "The Mysterons", was rendered electronically and accompanied by a [[staccato]] drum beat to introduce the lead character of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]].<ref name="Bentley, 40">Bentley, 40.</ref> This beat was also used to link scenes within episodes,<ref name="Bentley, 40"/> and to cut to [[Television advertisement|advertisement breaks]],<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 156">Archer and Hearn, 156.</ref> for which it was accompanied by a zooming image of the Spectrum logo as designed by Tony Dunsterville of the [[art department]].<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 156"/> On the subject of the beat, Anderson recalls, "When I went to the recording session, I heard the drum beat he had come up with and I thought, 'Christ, is this all he could produce?' Looking back on it, however, I can see that what he came up with worked very well."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 156"/>

The [[closing credits]] theme, "Captain Scarlet", underwent significant change after the completion of the first 14 episodes. The first version had been mainly instrumental, with [[vocoded]] interruptions of the words "Captain Scarlet!" provided by Gray himself.<ref name="Bentley, 40"/> This was then revised as a song performed by a London-based pop group The Spectrum, assembled by [[RCA Victor]]<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 157">Archer and Hearn, 157.</ref> as an imitation of the American band [[The Monkees]],<ref name="Bentley, 40"/> who happened to share their name with the organisation that appears in ''Captain Scarlet''.<ref name="Bentley, 40"/>

In addition to the main theme, Gray scored [[incidental music]] for 18 episodes of ''Captain Scarlet'' between March and December 1967.<ref name="Bentley, 41"/><ref name="TVCentury21">{{cite web|last=de Klerk|first=Theo|title=Complete Studio-Recording List of Barry Gray|url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&catid=116:barry-grey&Itemid=182|work=''tvcentury21.com''|date=25 December 2003|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5m00eATOK|archivedate=13 December 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> Musical accompaniment for the remaining 14 episodes was achieved by re-using these completed tracks as well as music from previous Anderson productions such as ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 41"/> In composing his incidental music, Gray made extensive use of two contrasting, yet similar, themes to illustrate Spectrum and the [[Mysteron]]s.<ref name="Soundtrack">{{cite album-notes|title=Captain Scarlet: Original Television Soundtrack|artist=[[Barry Gray]]|year=2003|coauthors=Titterton, Ralph; Mallett, Tim|page=3|publisher=Silva Screen Records|location=London}}</ref> In their notes to the soundtrack release, Ralph Titterton and Tim Mallett suggest that the music is dominated by a "[[Military band|military]] feel", with an emphasis placed on percussion, [[Brass instrument|brass]] and wind instruments, by contrast to the full [[orchestra]]l sound of the ''Thunderbirds'' score.<ref name="Soundtrack"/> With the exception of the four-note Mysteron [[Motif (music)|motif]], Gray generally restricted his use of electronic synthesisers, including an [[Ondes Martenot]], to space sequences, preferring traditional instruments for [[Earth]]-bound action.<ref name="Bentley, 40"/> Captain Scarlet's motif, heard in both versions of the end credits theme and the incidental music, is a [[Variation (music)|melodic variation]] on the Mysteron theme, emphasising Scarlet's history as an ex-Mysteron.<ref name="ImageDissectors">{{cite web|last=Weedon|first=Robert|title=Spectrum is Green|url=http://www.imagedissectors.com/article/69|work=''imagedissectors.com''|date=20 February 2010|accessdate=20 February 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qO9TFvZH|archivedate=10 June 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Puppets==
{{See also|Supermarionation}}
{{Quote box|quote=I still wonder about the wisdom of our decision to change the puppets. The heads were reduced in size to make them in proportion with the rest of their bodies, but the problem was that exact and precise movements became more vital than ever and that caused us terrible difficulties. After creating [[Snow White (Disney)|Snow White]] in perfect human form, [[Walt Disney]] said he'd never repeat that mistake, and I still have doubts about whether or not we did the right thing.|source=[[Gerry Anderson]] (2001)<ref name="Bentley, 14"/>|width=15%|align=right}}

Supermarionation, a technique in which the movement of [[marionette]] puppet mouths is electronically [[Lip sync|synchronised]] with character dialogue, had been formulated by [[Gerry Anderson]] for ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'' in 1960. Until production for ''Captain Scarlet'', the heads of the puppets had been disproportionately large in comparison to other body parts since each contained a [[solenoid]] that was the key component to the lip-synch mechanism. The production team had not been able to scale up the bodies to match the head, since this would have made puppets hard to operate<ref name="ToonhoundEntry">{{cite web|title=Toonhound.com Entry|url=http://www.toonhound.com/captainscarlet.htm|work=''toonhound.com''|accessdate=26 November 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080503021338/http://www.toonhound.com/captainscarlet.htm|archivedate=3 May 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref> and necessitated a coordinated scaling up in the sizes of the puppet sets.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151">Archer and Hearn, 151.</ref> Since Gerry Anderson had expressed frustration with this [[caricature]]d design during production of earlier Supermarionation series,<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151"/> and wished that the puppets would more accurately reflect the human biology,<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151"/> before production on ''Captain Scarlet'', the producer [[Reg Hill]] and his associate, [[John Read (producer)|John Read]],<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203">Drake and Bassett, 203.</ref> designed a new kind of puppet in which the solenoid was relocated to the chest area to permit a head of realistic proportions.<ref name="HowsWhys"/><ref name="TVHeaven"/><ref name="ToonhoundEntry"/><ref name="Puppets">{{cite web|last=Wickes|first=Simon|title=FAQ<U+2014>Puppets|url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=112:the-puppets-look-different-between-thunderbirds-and-captain-scarlet-what-happened&catid=122:faqs&Itemid=179|work=''tvcentury21.com''|date=2 January 2004|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5m00k9kSq|archivedate=13 December 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> The [[costume designer]] for ''Captain Scarlet'' was [[Sylvia Anderson]], who was influenced by the work of French fashion designer [[Pierre Cardin]], in particular his 1966 "Cosmonaut" collection, in designing the Spectrum uniforms.<ref name="Bentley, 19">Bentley, 19.</ref>

After test-sculpting in [[Plasticine]], the puppet heads were moulded on a [[silicone rubber]] base and made using [[fibreglass]].<ref name="Bentley, 18">Bentley, 18.</ref> At heights ranging from 20 to 24&nbsp;inches (approximately one-third life-size) the next-generation puppets were no shorter than their predecessors.<ref name="Bentley, 18"/> For previous series, puppet eyes had been sized out of proportion to the heads, but as part of the realistic look introduced in ''Captain Scarlet'', the eyes of production personnel were photographed and the images scaled down for attachment to the eye sockets.<ref name="HowsWhys"/><ref name="Teletronic"/><ref name="Archer, 55">Archer, 55.</ref> As had been the case for earlier series, a number of alternative heads displaying a range of expressions were created for main character puppets, including "smilers", "frowners" and "blinkers".<ref name="Bentley, 18"/> Since episodes of ''Captain Scarlet'' were filmed in pairs, one on each of the puppet stages available at the [[AP Films#Century21|Century 21]] Studios, duplicates were made of the "expressionless" template of each main character.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 266">Drake and Bassett, 266.</ref> For the [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|pilot episode]], an "agony" head was specially sculpted for the [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] puppet for a brief [[reaction shot]] of Scarlet's [[Mysteron]] double being shot by [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]]. 

[[File:CaptainScarletPuppets.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=16|250px|left|alt=Video clip from "Attack on Cloudbase" demonstrating the difficulties of inducing realistic motion in the puppet characters of "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons". Whenever a character is required to move, the camera shifts to a close-up angle to conceal the hand of a puppeteer pushing the puppet forward. The shot is interrupted when Captains Scarlet and Blue walk into a room through an automatic door, since the head strings make it impossible to film the action in a single motion.|Changes made to the original [[Supermarionation]] design made puppet motion more stilted than before.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203"/> For example, to portray a character walk, an operator would need to hold the puppet's legs, while the camera maintained a [[close-up]] shot to conceal the hand from view.<ref name="Bentley, 16"/> This clip from the episode "[[Attack on Cloudbase]]" includes an interruption in the shot when the characters of Captains [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]] and [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Blue]] are required to walk through a door into the [[Cloudbase]] Radar Room containing [[Captain Magenta]], since the strings supporting the puppet heads rendered it impossible to film such entrances in a continuous shot.<ref name="HowsWhys"/> Furthermore, through the characters of both Scarlet and [[Colonel White]], whose English accents are demonstrated here, [[Gerry Anderson]] biographers Marcus Hearn and Simon Archer assert that the sound of ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'' contrasts with that of the earlier ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', altering its effect on the viewer.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"/>]]

The increased [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of the puppets meant that their mobility was significantly reduced,<ref name="HowsWhys"/> ironically leaving the new design less life-like than Anderson had hoped,<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203"/> as he recalls: "Suddenly, all the movements had to be as realistic as the puppets and that made it difficult for the puppeteers to animate them."<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203"/> To minimise the amount of movement required, the puppets were made to stand on moving walkways or sit at moving desks: for example, [[Colonel White]]'s desk on [[Cloudbase]] is seen to rotate, while [[Lieutenant Green]] is seen to operate the Cloudbase main computer from a sliding chair. Puppeteer Jan King:

<blockquote>
The ''Captain Scarlet'' puppets were not built to walk. They were too heavy and not weighted properly anyway ... It is virtually impossible to get a string puppet to walk convincingly on film unless it is a very caricatured puppet. In ''Captain Scarlet'', if a puppet had to move off-screen, it was done in a [[Medium shot|head-and-shoulders shot]]<U+2014>the floor puppeteer would hold the legs of the puppet and then move the puppet physically out of shot at the right time, trying to make the body and shoulders move as if the puppet were walking.<ref name="Bentley, 16">Bentley, 16.</ref>
</blockquote>

The "under control"<ref name="HowsWhys"/> puppets described by King were stringless and controlled from the waist. One resulting advantage was that a puppet could be moved through a doorway without necessitating a break in the shot.<ref name="HowsWhys"/> For shots displaying characters such as the Angels seated in aircraft cockpits, variations of the "under control" design, comprising just a head and torso, were manipulated by levers and wires located beneath the set.<ref name="HowsWhys"/> This development of Supermarionation would be named "[[Supermarionation#Supermacromation|Supermacromation]]" when Anderson returned to puppetry in the 1980s with his later production, ''[[Terrahawks]]''.

===Revamps and likenesses===
Before ''Captain Scarlet'', supporting character puppets had been specially sculpted in [[clay]] as and when episodes required them. The guest parts in ''Captain Scarlet'', however, were filled by a permanent "repertory company" of over 50 puppets made to the same standards of workmanship as the main characters.<ref name="ToonhoundEntry"/><ref name="Bentley, 18"/> Known as "revamp puppets" or "revamps", these puppets appeared on an episode-by-episode basis, cosmetically altered for each role in aspects such as hairstyle and hair colour.<ref name="HowsWhys"/><ref name="ToonhoundEntry"/><ref name="Bentley, 18"/> An initial intention was for each episode to include a "guest star" puppet, to be sculpted on, and voiced by, a known public figure, but this idea was abandoned due to budgetary constraints.<ref name="HowsWhys"/><ref name="Drake and Bassett, 203"/> Both main character and revamp puppets from ''Captain Scarlet'' appeared in Anderson's final two [[Supermarionation]] series, ''[[Joe 90]]'' and ''[[The Secret Service]]''.<ref name="ToonhoundEntry"/>

'''[[Donald Gray]]''', who had found himself [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] after appearing in the lead role in ''[[The Vise|Saber of London]]'', a [[Detective fiction|detective series]], was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career.<ref name="Bentley, 25">Bentley, 25.</ref> The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: [[Colonel White]], [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] and [[The Mysterons]].

The voice of Captain Ochre was provided by English-born Canadian, '''[[Jeremy Wilkin]]'''. Having served in the role of [[Virgil Tracy]] during the second series of ''Thunderbirds'', Wilkin remained to voice Ochre for the subsequent production. The character of [[Captain Magenta]], meanwhile, was voiced by '''[[Gary Files]]'''.

Supporting character voices were performed by Anderson, Files, Hill, Maxwell, Morgan, Tingwell and Wilkin.

==Titles and credits==
{{Quote box|quote=The [[Motion picture credits|titles]] on the series were always devised by me.

''Captain Scarlet'' episodes, with the exception of [[The Mysterons (Captain Scarlet episode)|the pilot]], incorporate two sets of [[opening titles]]. The first of these sequences presents the [[title card]] and major production team [[credits]]. The camera moves forward through the model set of a run-down, night-time alleyway, forming the [[Point of view shot|point-of-view shot]] of an unseen assassin, who turns a corner only to meet his death at the gun barrel of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]]. The two seven-letter words of "Captain Scarlet" then appear on-screen in time with the seven strikes of the ''Captain Scarlet'' [[staccato]] drum beat composed by [[Barry Gray]]. This opening sequence is accompanied by a [[voice-over]] from [[Ed Bishop]], which states, "The [[Mysteron]]s. Sworn enemies of [[Earth]]. Possessing the ability to recreate an exact likeness of an object or person. But first, they must destroy ... Leading the fight, one man fate has made indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet." The sequence is intended to demonstrate Scarlet's indestructibility; the assassin fires on the agent with a [[machine gun]], but the bullets have no effect on their target.<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 244">Drake and Bassett, 244.</ref>

A number of variations on this voice-over exist: Bishop's introduction to the pilot is unique to that episode, and runs, "The finger is on the trigger. About to unleash a force with terrible powers, beyond the comprehension of man. This force we shall know as 'the Mysterons' ... This man will be our hero, for fate will make him indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet."<ref group="e" name="The Mysterons"/> A rare<ref name="Lesterdemon">{{cite journal|last=Pixley|first=Andrew|coauthors=Michael Richardson, Alice Hendry|year=1985|title=Supermarionation<U+2014>the UK Broadcasts|journal=Supermarionation is Go!|issue=14<U+2013>5|publisher=Super M Productions|url=http://lester.demon.nl/superm/broadcastsUK.html|accessdate=6 November 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5m02NT3pI|archivedate=13 December 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> alternative version runs, "One man.

Later prints of the episodes feature an additional voice-over<U+2014>a warning from [[Donald Gray]], which states, "Captain Scarlet is indestructible. You are not. Remember this. Do not try to imitate him."<ref name="Lesterdemon"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 163">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 163.</ref> This served both to establish the background to the series and to warn younger fans not to take risks by copying Scarlet's exploits.<ref name="Lesterdemon"/><ref name="Cull: Media History, 200">Cull: ''Media History'', 200.</ref> The warning has been placed after the alternative voice-over which starts "One man ...",<ref name="Lesterdemon"/> or else used in isolation, with Gray providing the sole narration for this first opening sequence.<ref name="Lesterdemon"/>

From the [[Winged Assassin|second episode]], another opening sequence, presenting the main puppet cast, runs after the [[Cold open|teaser]] which sets up the plot to an episode. While the Mysterons announce their latest threat against Earth, the "Mysteron rings" pass over the characters in a number of environments to demonstrate the omnipresence of the extraterrestrials,<ref name="Drake and Bassett, 244"/> while Spectrum codenames are credited on-screen. The Mysterons invariably start their threats with the words, "This is the voice of the Mysterons. We know that you can hear us, [[Earthling|Earthmen]]." For Japanese broadcasts, the opening credits were replaced with a montage of action scenes from various episodes, with children singing an accompanying theme tune.

The [[end credits]] were originally to be accompanied by images of [[printed circuit board]]s and other electronic components, to fit in with the Andersons' initial idea that the resurrected Captain Scarlet would be a "[[Android|mechanical man]]".<ref name="Bentley, 15"/> In the completed series, the credits are superimposed on ten paintings of Scarlet in moments of mortal peril. The [[instrumental]] version of Gray's ''Captain Scarlet'' end theme accompanies these images in the earlier episodes, but is replaced by the Spectrum pop group's [[Lyrics|lyrical]] version for the later episodes.

{{Quote box|quote=While it would become a huge success, ''Captain Scarlet'' received a less than enthusiastic reception from critics.

Science-fiction author [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] perceives a drop in quality between ''Thunderbirds'' and ''Captain Scarlet'' in terms of the use of [[special effects]] in relation to richness of the scripting. In this respect, he compares the divide to the commercial disappointment of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984) after the success of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981):<ref name="Peel, 245">Peel, 245.</ref> "Anderson made the same mistake that [[George Lucas]] made, assuming that if the [[Special effects|effects]] were praised in ''Thunderbirds'', the public wanted a show with more effects."<ref name="Peel, 245"/> Peel also turns attention to the nature of Captain Scarlet himself, suggesting that Anderson's conception of an indestructible hero who can unfailingly return to life after death made the conclusions to plotlines too predictable.<ref name="Peel, 246">Peel, 246.</ref> He also notes his concern that Scarlet, who is often seen to risk his life to foil Mysteron plots, provided a poor role model for an impressionable target audience of children.<ref name="Peel, 246"/>

===Puppets===
On the subject of [[Sylvia Anderson]]'s costume design, critic Mark Bould praises the "commitment to fashion" evident throughout the Anderson series, but particularly lauds the design of the Spectrum Angel uniforms.<ref name="Bould, 220">Bould, 220.</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] design of the new puppets has been praised by commentators such as Vincent Terrace<ref name="CrimeTV">{{cite book|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|title=Crime Fighting Heroes of Television: Over 10,000 Facts from 151 Shows, 1949<U+2013>2001|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|location=North Carolina|year=2002|page=43|isbn=0-7864-1395-6}}</ref> and criticised by others. Some members of the production team perceived a lack of charm in comparison to the earlier puppets due to the more natural proportions that were now being used.<ref name="Bentley, 14"/> Director [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]]'s initial thoughts on a prototype, produced by head of puppets John Brown,<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151"/> were, "it was as if there was a little dead person in [the box] ... because it was perfect in all its proportions it just looked odd."<ref name="Bentley, 14"/> Brown remembers presenting the prototype alongside the [[Lady Penelope]] puppet from ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and gauging the response from production staff,<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151"/> stating, "when they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn't like it, some did."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 151"/><ref name="Teletronic"/> Critics have highlighted the sacrifice of facial expression in favour of a realistic design,<ref name="h2g2">{{cite web|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'' <U+2014> Background to the TV Series|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A786486|work=''[[BBC Online]]''|date=12 August 2002|accessdate=1 October 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070806034845/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A786486|archivedate=6 August 2007|deadurl=no}}</ref> a consequence on which Terry Curtis elaborates:

<blockquote>
The changes of expression on those puppets had to be perfect and in no way exaggerated like the old ones were. I remember when [fellow puppet designer] Tim Cooksey did [[Colonel White]], he had a lot of trouble doing different expressions as the face was just so realistic. I had a similar problem with [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]]. I remember I did a Blue "smiler" head and people could hardly tell the difference between that and the normal one.<ref name="Bentley, 16"/>
</blockquote>

Sculptor John Blundall has referred to the new puppet design as "ridiculous",<ref name="Teletronic"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152">Archer and Hearn, 152.</ref> denouncing Anderson's attempts to have the puppets appear more life-like for the reason that, in his view, "We always try to do with puppets what you can't do with humans."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152"/> Stating a preference for the ''Thunderbirds''-era design,<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152"/> Blundall agrees that the transition from [[caricature]] to realism led to a reduction in "character and personality",<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152"/> asserting that "If the puppet appears completely natural, the audience no longer has to use its imagination."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152"/> In response, Anderson himself states that he pushed for the decision to reshape the puppets to satisfy viewers,<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152"/> summarising the development as not "a case of moving to a new technique, but more a case of incorporating new ideas with existing methods."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 152"/>

Summing up ''Captain Scarlet'', in comparison to ''Thunderbirds'', as "better puppets, bigger [[Action (fiction)|action]] and a huge step backwards in stories",<ref name="Peel, 244">Peel, 244.</ref> [[John Peel (writer)|Peel]] disputes the claim that the next generation of [[Supermarionation]] puppets constitute a failure on the part of the series,<ref name="Peel, 245"/> arguing that the increased realism did not deter viewers who had been familiar with the earlier design.<ref name="Peel, 245"/> Although he suggests that the [[characterisation]]s became less endearing,<ref name="Peel, 245"/> Peel's attribution of the reduced believability of ''Captain Scarlet'' is to a perceived over-emphasis on the visual and [[Special effects|effects]]-led aspects to the series at the expense of its human side.<ref name="Peel, 245"/>

''Captain Scarlet'' became involved in the [[black-and-white dualism]] debate during its 1993 British repeat run for its use of the codenames "White" to designate the head of Spectrum, [[Colonel White]], and "Black" for the villainous [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]].<ref name="Bentley, 122"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 160">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 160.</ref> [[Gerry Anderson]] defended his series against the accusations of [[racism]] and [[political incorrectness]] by reminding critics that the Spectrum characters of [[Lieutenant Green]], Melody Angel and Harmony Angel play heroic roles despite being of either black or Asian descent.<ref name="Bentley, 122"/> Green, in particular, is the only leading male black character to appear in an Anderson production.<ref name="Archer, 32iii">Archer, 32iii.</ref>

Guyanese actor [[Cy Grant]], who voiced Green and saw the series as having positive multicultural value,<ref name="CGWeb"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 160"/> has also noted the [[allegorical]] nature of ''Captain Scarlet''.<ref name="CGWeb"/> Christian symbolism is heavily implied, with Colonel White as [[God in Christianity|God]], Captain Black as the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|Devil]], [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] as [[Christ]], [[Cloudbase]] as [[Heaven#In Christianity|Heaven]], and characters codenamed "the [[Angel#Christianity|Angels]]",<ref name="CGWeb"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 160"/> but Grant also mentions the idea of Lieutenant Green as an African trickster hero.<ref name="CGWeb"/> On dualism, he suggests that, "the '[[darkness]]' of the [[Mysteron]]s is most easily seen as the psychological rift<U+2014>the struggle of [[Good and evil|'good' and 'evil']] <U+2014> of the [[Western world]] as personified by Colonel White and his team.

''Captain Scarlet'' also formed the basis of three [[comic strip]]s drawn for the weekly Anderson-related children's comic ''[[TV Century 21]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 102"/> Spanning 17 issues (numbers 141<U+2013>157) from September 1967 to January 1968, the strip adventures were written by [[Angus P.

In 1980, the New York offices of ITC, under the supervision of [[Robert Mandell]],<ref name="Bentley, 121">Bentley, 121.</ref> combined episodes from the original series to make two [[compilation film]]s for American audiences, with the aim of reviving transatlantic [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] sales.<ref name="Bentley, 121"/> This became common practice for Anderson productions during the 1980s, with [[made-for-television]] films comprising episodes of ''[[Stingray (TV series)|Stingray]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' airing to US [[Cable television in the United States|cable]] audiences under the generic promotional banner of "Super Space Theater".<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 361">Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', 361.</ref> On 24 November 1988, the second ''Captain Scarlet'' film, ''[[Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars]]'', was broadcast as the second episode of the American television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', from [[Minneapolis]], on station [[KTMA]].

===CGI test film and series===
{{Main|Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet}}

In 1999, [[Gerry Anderson]] supervised the production of a short [[computer-animated]] test film, ''Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons'', to explore the possibility of updating a number of his 1960s [[Supermarionation]] series for a 21st-century audience.<ref name="Bentley, 123">Bentley, 123.</ref><ref name="Teletronic5">{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Laurence|title=Gerry Anderson: The Puppet Master<U+2014>Part 5|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson5.htm|work=''teletronic.co.uk''|year=2006|month=June|accessdate=22 November 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071030130851/http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson5.htm|archivedate=30 October 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> The [[working title]] was ''Captain Scarlet<U+2014>The New Millennium''.<ref name="Teletronic5"/> Produced in London by the [[Moving Picture Company]],<ref name="Bentley, 123"/> the film features [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]] and [[Ed Bishop]] reprising the roles of Captains [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]] and [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Blue]].<ref name="ToonhoundEntry"/><ref name="Teletronic5"/> Made using a combination of [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] 3D computer graphics software and [[motion-capture]] technology,<ref name="Bentley, 124">Bentley, 124.</ref><ref name="Teletronic5"/> the plot commences a few years after the [[Mysteron]]s end their hostilities against [[Earth]], but the reappearance of [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] sets the stage for a revival of the war with [[Mars]].<ref name="Bentley, 124"/> Although the film has yet to receive a [[home video]] release, it was publicly screened at a [[Fanderson]] convention in 2000<ref name="Bentley, 125"/><ref name="SHADO-USECC"/><ref name="Teletronic5"/> and at a science lecture in 2001.<ref name="Bentley, 125"/>

Plans for a full CGI ''Captain Scarlet'' television series to follow the test film finally resulted in ''Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet''. A [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the original series, this was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on the Saturday-morning [[CITV]] programme, ''[[Ministry of Mayhem]]'', from 12 February 2005.<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 282">Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', 282.</ref> Produced by "Anderson Entertainment" and the "Indestructible Production Company",<ref name="Teletronic5"/><ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 281">Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', 281.</ref> the animation used to create the series is billed in the credits as "[[Hypermarionation]]"<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 281"/> to acknowledge the 1960s puppet technique, Supermarionation.<ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 281"/>
