'''Edward II''' (25 April 1284&nbsp;<U+2013> 21 September 1327), also called '''Edward of Caernarfon''', was [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] from 1307 until he was [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] in January 1327. The fourth son of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Edward became the heir to the throne following the death of his older brother [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alfonso]]. He grew up to be tall, athletic and was considered good-looking by his contemporaries. From 1300 onward, Edward accompanied his father on his [[Wars of Scottish Independence|campaigns to pacify Scotland]], and in 1307 he was knighted in a [[Feast of the Swans|grand ceremony]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Edward succeeded to the throne later that year, following his father's death. In 1308, he married [[Isabella of France]], the daughter of the powerful [[Philip IV of France|King Philip IV]], as part of a long-running effort to resolve the tensions between the English and French crowns.

Edward had a very close relationship with [[Piers Gaveston]], who had first joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of Edward and Gaveston's relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, [[gay|lovers]] or [[blood brother|sworn brothers]]. Gaveston's position as Edward's [[favourite]] provoked discontent both among the barons and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to [[exile]] him. On Gaveston's return, the King was pressured into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms called the [[Ordinances of 1311]]. Gaveston was banished by the barons, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, the [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Earl of Lancaster]], a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confronation. England was pushed back onto the defensive in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by [[Robert the Bruce]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. [[Great Famine of 1315<U+2013>17|Widespread famine]] followed, and criticism of the King mounted.

The Despenser family, in particular [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], became close friends and advisers to Edward, but in 1321 Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands and forced the King to exile them. In response, Edward led a [[Despenser War|short military campaign]], capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a peace treaty in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Isabella allied herself with the exiled [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and invaded England with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled into Wales, where he was captured in November. Edward was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and he died in [[Berkeley Castle]] on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.

Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s 1592 play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', along with other plays, films, novels and media. Many of these have focused on the possible homosexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries were highly critical of his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics argued that the growth of [[Parliament of England|parliamentary institutions]] during his reign were a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.

==Background==
Edward II was the fourth son of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his first wife, [[Eleanor of Castile]].<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=3}}</ref> His father was the [[King of England]], and had also inherited [[Gascony]] in south-western France, which he held as the [[feudal]] vassal of the [[King of France]], and the [[Lordship of Ireland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|pp=13<U+2013>14}}</ref> His mother was from the [[ Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family, and held the [[County of Ponthieu]] in northern France. Edward I proved to be a successful military leader, leading the [[Second Barons' War|suppression of the baronial revolts]] in the 1260s, and joining the [[Ninth Crusade]].<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=33}}</ref> During the 1280s he [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquered North Wales]], removing the [[Welsh people|native Welsh]] princes from power, and in the 1290s he [[Wars of Scottish independence|intervened in Scotland's civil war]], claiming [[suzerainty]] over the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=5<U+2013>6}}</ref> He was a considered an extremely successful ruler by his contemporaries, largely able to control the powerful [[earl]]s that formed the senior ranks of the English nobility.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref> The historian [[Michael Prestwich]] describes Edward I as "a king to inspire fear and respect", while [[John Gillingham]] characterises him as an efficient bully.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=5}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/history/article750063.ece | title=Hard on Wales | separator = ,| postscript =none | accessdate=22 April 2014 | last1= Gillingham| first1= John | website=Times Literary Supplement | publisher=Times Literary Supplement | year = 2008 }}</ref>

Despite his successes, Edward I died leaving a range of challenges for his son to resolve.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=25}}</ref> One of the most challenging was the problem of Scotland, where Edward's long and ultimately inconclusive military campaign was still ongoing when he died.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=241}}</ref> Edward's control of Gascony was a source of ongoing tension with the French kings.<ref name=Brown1988P575>{{harvnb|Brown|1988|p=575}}</ref> The French kings considered Gascony to be part of the Kingdom of France, and were insistent that the English kings should give [[homage]] to them for the lands; repeated English kings had seen this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved.<ref name=Brown1988P575/> Edward I also faced increasing opposition from the his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left debts of around <U+00A3>200,000 on his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=30<U+2013>31, 93<U+2013>94}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurate covert sums of medieval money into modern incomes and prices.

==Early life (1284<U+2013>1307)==

===Birth===
[[File:Caernarfon Castle 1994.jpg|thumb|[[Caernarfon Castle]], Edward's birthplace]]
Edward II was born in [[Caernarfon Castle]] in [[North Wales]] on 25 April 1284, less than a year after Edward I had conquered the region, and as a result is sometimes called Edward of Caernarfon.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=33, 36}}</ref> The King probably deliberately chose the castle as the location for Edward's birth, as it was an important symbolic location for the native Welsh, associated with [[Roman Britain|Roman imperial history]], and formed the centre of the his new royal administration of North Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=35<U+2013>36}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=3}}</ref> Edward's birth brought with it predictions of greatness, with contemporary [[prophet]]s, who believed that the [[Last Days]] of the world were imminent, declaring him to be a new [[King Arthur]], who would lead England to glory.<ref>{{harvnb|Coote|2000|pp=84<U+2013>86}}</ref> [[David Powel]], a 16th-century clergyman, suggested that the baby was offered to the Welsh as a prince "that was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English", but there is no evidence to support this account.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref>

Edward's name was [[Middle English|English]] in origin, linking him to the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[saint]] [[Edward the Confessor]], and was chosen by his father in contrast to the more traditional [[Norman language|Norman]] and [[Castilian language|Castilian]] names selected for Edward's brothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=39}}</ref> Edward had three elder brothers, John and Henry, who had died before Edward was born, and [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alfonso]], who died in August 1284, leaving Edward as the heir to the throne.<ref name=Phillips2011P40>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=40}}</ref> Although Edward was a relatively healthy child, there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir.<ref name=Phillips2011P40/> After his birth, Edward was looked after for a few months by a [[wet-nurse]] called Mariota or Mary Maunsel, until she fell ill, when Alice de Leygrave became his foster mother.<ref name=PhillipsChaplaisHaines>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=37, 47}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=4}}</ref> He would have barely known his natural mother Eleanor, who was in Gascony during his earliest years.<ref name=PhillipsChaplaisHaines/> An official household complete with staff was created for the new baby, under the direction of a clerk, Giles of Oudenarde.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=47}}</ref>

===Childhood, personality and appearance===
[[File:Gal nations edward i.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait in [[Westminster Abbey]], thought to be of Edward's father, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]]]
Spending on Edward's personal household increased as he grew older, and in 1293 William of Blyborough took over as its administrator.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=48}}</ref> Edward was probably given a religious education by the [[Dominican friar]], whom his mother invited into his household in 1290.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2006|p=226}}</ref> He was assigned one of his grandmother's followers, Guy Ferre, as his ''magister'', who was responsible for his discipline, training him in riding and military skills.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=53<U+2013>54}}</ref> It is uncertain how well educated Edward was; there is little evidence for his ability to read and write, although his mother was keen that other of her children were well educated, and Ferre was himself a relatively learned man for the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=55<U+2013>57}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=11}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Earlier histories of Edward II considered him to be poorly educated, principally because he took his coronation oath in French, rather than Latin, and because of his interest in agricultural crafts.

In 1290, Edward's father confirmed the [[Treaty of Birgham]], in which he promised to marry his six-year old son to the young [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret of Norway]], who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=19}}</ref> Margaret died later that year, bringing an end to the plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=42}}</ref> Edward's mother, Eleanor, died shortly afterwards, followed by his grandmother, [[Eleanor of Provence]].<ref name=Phillips2011P43>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=43}}</ref> Edward I was distraught at his wife's death and held a huge funeral for her; his son inherited the County of Ponthieu from Eleanor on her death.<ref name=Phillips2011P43/> Next, a French marriage was considered for the young Edward, to help secure peace with France, but war broke out.<ref name=Phillips2011PP77HallamEverard>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=77<U+2013>78}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=360}}</ref> The idea was replaced with the proposal of a marriage to a daughter of the [[Guy, Count of Flanders|Count of Flanders]], but this too fell through after it was blocked by [[Philip IV of France]].<ref name=Phillips2011PP77HallamEverard/>

===Early campaigns in Scotland===

Between 1297 and 1298, Edward was left in charge of England while Edward I campaigned in [[Flanders]] against Philip IV, who had occupied part of the English King's lands in Gascony.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=78<U+2013>79}}</ref> On his return, Edward I agreed a [[Treaty of Paris (1303)|peace treaty]], under which he took Philip's sister, [[Margaret of France, Queen of England|Margaret]], as his wife and agreed that Prince Edward would in due course marry Philip's daughter, [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], who was then only two years old.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=80<U+2013>81}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=30}}</ref> In theory, this marriage would mean that the disputed Duchy of Gascony would be inherited by a descendant of both Edward and Philip, providing a possible end to the long-running tensions.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1988|p=574}}</ref> The young Edward seems to have got on well with his new mother-in-law, who gave birth to Edward's two half-brothers, [[Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Thomas]] and [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund]], in 1300 and 1301.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=81<U+2013>82}}; {{harvnb|Marshall|2006|p=190}}</ref> As king, Edward later provided his brothers with financial support and titles.<ref name=Marshall2006PP198>{{harvnb|Marshall|2006|pp=198<U+2013>199}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Edward II faced criticism from contemporaries for favouring Gaveston above his half-brothers, although detailed research by Alison Marshall shows more generosity, Marshall arguing that "for once", Edward was criticised unfairly.<ref name=Marshall2006PP198/>|group="nb"}}

Edward I returned to Scotland once again in 1300, and this time took his son with him, making him the commander of the rearguard at the siege of [[Caerlaverock Castle|Caerlaverock]].<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=82<U+2013>84}}</ref> In the spring of 1301, the King declared Edward the [[Prince of Wales]], granting him the [[Earldom of Chester]] and lands across North Wales; he seems to have hoped that this would help pacify the region, and that it would give his son more financial independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=85<U+2013>87}}</ref> Edward received homage from his Welsh subjects and then joined his father for the 1301 Scottish campaign, taking an army of around 300 soldiers north with him, which successfully captured [[Turnberry Castle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=88<U+2013>90}}</ref> Edward also took part in the 1303 campaign, when he besieged [[Brechin Castle]], deploying his own siege engine in the operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=91<U+2013>93}}</ref> In the spring of 1304, Edward conducted negotiations with the rebel Scottish leaders on the King's behalf and, when these failed, he joined his father for the siege of [[Stirling Castle]].<ref name="Phillips 2011 94-95">{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=94<U+2013>95}}</ref>

The contemporary evidence for a homosexual relationship comes primarily from an anonymous chronicler in the 1320s, who described how Edward "felt such love" for Gaveston that "he entered into a covenant of constancy, and bound himself with him before all other mortals with a bond of indissoluble love, firmly drawn up and fastened with a knot".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=97}}</ref> The first specific suggestion that Edward engaged in sex with men was recorded in 1334, when [[Adam Orleton]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], was accused of having stated in 1326 that Edward was a "sodomite", although Orleton defended himself by arguing that he had meant that Edward's advisor, [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], was a sodomite, rather than the late King.<ref>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|p=50}}</ref> The Meaux Chronicle from the 1390s similarly notes that Edward gave himself "too much to the vice of sodomy."<ref>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|p=52}}</ref>

Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston may have simply been friends, with a close working relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=31}}</ref> Contemporary [[chronicler]] comments are vaguely worded, Orleton's allegations were at least in part politically motivated, and closely resemble the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope [[Boniface VIII]] and the [[Knights Templar]] in 1303 and 1308 respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|pp=51<U+2013>53}}</ref> Later chronicler accounts of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=102}}</ref> Historians such as [[Michael Prestwich]] and [[J. R. S. Phillips|Seymour Phillips]] argue that the very public nature of the English royal court would have it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet, and that observe that neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=70<U+2013>71}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=99}}</ref>

Edward called for a fresh military campaign for Scotland, but this idea was quietly abandoned, and instead the King and the barons met in August 1308 to discuss reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=151}}</ref> Behind the scenes, Edward started negotiations to convince both [[Pope Clement V]] and Philip IV to allow Gaveston to return to England, offering in exchange to suppress the [[Knights Templar]] in England, and to release Bishop Langton from prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=152<U+2013>153}}</ref> Edward called a new meeting of members of the Church and key barons in January 1309, and the leading earls then gathered in March and April, possibly under the leadership of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas]], the [[Earl of Lancaster]].<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=154<U+2013>155}}</ref> Another parliament followed, which refused to allow Gaveston to return to England, but which offered to grant Edward additional taxes if he agreed to a programme of reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=156<U+2013>157}}</ref>

Following his return, Gaveston's relationship with the major barons became increasingly difficult.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=161}}</ref> He was considered arrogant, and he took to referring to the earls by offensive names, including calling one of their more powerful members the "dog of Warwick".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=161}}; {{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=68}}</ref> The Earl of Lancaster and Gaveston's enemies refused to attend parliament in 1310 because Gaveston would be present.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=162}}</ref> Edward, however, was facing increasing financial problems, owing <U+00A3>22,000 to his [[Frescobaldi]] Italian bankers, and facing protests about how he was using his right of [[prise]]s to acquire supplies for the war in Scotland.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=162<U+2013>163}}</ref> Edward's attempts to raise an army for Scotland collapsed and the earls suspended the collection of the new taxes.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=163}}</ref>

Edward's difficulties were exacerbated by prolonged problems in [[Economics of English Agriculture in the Middle Ages#The Great Famine of 1315<U+2013>1317|English agriculture]], part of a wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the [[Great Famine of 1315<U+2013>17|Great Famine]]. The famine began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and bad rains the following the spring, killing many sheep and cattle in 1315; the bad weather continued, almost unabated, through into 1321, resulting in a string of bad harvests.<ref>{{harvnb|Jordan|1996|p=171}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=252<U+2013>253}}</ref> Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices.<ref>{{harvnb|Jordan|1996|p=171}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=253}}</ref> Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success.<ref>{{harvnb|Jordan|1996|pp=172<U+2013>174}}</ref>

[[The Despenser War|Civil war finally broke out]] in England in 1321.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=372<U+2013>378}}</ref> The trigger for the conflict was the tension between many of the barons and the Despenser family, which had been growing for several years.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=121<U+2013>123}}</ref> [[Hugh Despenser the Elder]] had served both Edward and his father, while Hugh Despenser the Younger, had married into the wealthy de Clare family, become the King's [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], and acquired Glamorgan in the [[Welsh Marches]] in 1317.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=364<U+2013>365}}</ref> Hugh the Younger had then begun to expand his holdings and power across Wales, mainly at the expense of the other [[Marcher Lord]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=365<U+2013>366}}</ref> The Earl of Lancaster and the Despensers were fierce enemies, and Lancaster's antipathy was shared by most the Despensers' neighbours, including the Earl of Hereford, the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]] and the recently elevated Hugh Audley and Roger Damory.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=364, 366<U+2013>367}}</ref> Edward, however, increasingly relied upon the Despensers for advice and support, and he was particularly close to Hugh the Younger, whom one chronicler noted he "loved&nbsp;... dearly with all his heart and mind".<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=367<U+2013>368}}</ref>

In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a coalition of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=374<U+2013>375}}</ref> Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and marched west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=375<U+2013>377}}</ref> This time, however, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=376<U+2013>377}}</ref> The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by a coalition of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=377<U+2013>379}}; {{harvnb|Jordan|1996|p=84}}</ref> Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=383<U+2013>387}}</ref> Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=390}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=128<U+2013>129}}</ref>

One line of argument stemmed from the 1259 treaty agreed by Edward's grand-father, Henry III, under which Henry had agreed to give homage for Gascony; Edward's laywers observed that this treaty, which underpinned Edward's 1303 treaty with France, had been a bilateral agreement between the two kings, rather than a conventional feudal agreement. As such, Edward's offering homage for Gascony was dependent on the French crown delivering on its own commitments, rather than an absolute duty. Edward's lawyers also argued that Isabella had a potential claim to the lands in the south under customary French law. When granting Gascony to Isabella, Phillip IV appeared to have been divided up his lands, as was customary at the time, rather than giving a conditional grant, which meant that Gascony was an [[allod]], Edward's personal property, and as such not subject to the French King's laws on the carrying of weapons or money.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=322, 387}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=19<U+2013>20, 305<U+2013>306}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

During August and September 1326 Edward mobilised his defences along the coasts of England to protect against the possibility of an invasion ether by France, or by Roger Mortimer.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=501<U+2013>502}}</ref> Fleets were gathered at the ports of [[Portsmouth]] in the south, and [[River Orwell|Orwell]] on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into [[Normandy]] as a diversionary attack.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=502}}</ref> Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact.<ref>{{harvnb|Ruddick|2013|p=205}}</ref> The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=160<U+2013>164, 174<U+2013>175}}</ref> Some 2,000 men were ordered to gathered at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=501, 504}}</ref>

===Abdication===
[[File:Eduard2 arest.jpg|thumb|upright|An 15th-century depiction of Isabella capturing Edward]]
Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took revenge on the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, declared a traitor and sentenced to be drawn, disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=516<U+2013>518}}</ref> Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in [[Fleet Prison]]; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=516}}</ref> Edward's own position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and in principle he remained the king, but most of the new administration had a lot to lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=520<U+2013>522}}</ref>

There was no established procedure, however, for removing an English king.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=523<U+2013>524}}</ref> Adam Orleton, the [[Bishop of Hereford]], made a series of public allegations about Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament was called at Westminster, at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=524<U+2013>525}}</ref> The parliament was initially ambivalent, but the London crowds weighed in, calling for Prince Edward to take the throne, and on 12 January the leading barons and clergy drew up an agreement that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=526}}</ref> The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=529<U+2013>530}}</ref>

===Death and aftermath===

Those opposed to the new government began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer therefore decided to move Edward to the more secure location of [[Berkeley Castle]] in [[Gloucestershire]], where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=542<U+2013>543}}</ref> Once at the castle, Edward was kept in the custody of Mortimer's brother-in-law, Thomas Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given <U+00A3>5 a day for Edward's maintenance.<ref name=Phillips2011P541>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=541}}</ref> It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated.<ref name=Phillips2011P541/> A poem, the ''[[Lament of Edward II]]'', was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.<ref name=Poemdetails>{{harvnb|Galbraith|1935|p=221}}; {{harvnb|McKisack|1959|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Smallwood|1973|p=528}}; {{harvnb|Valente|2002|p=422}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|For a sceptical comment, see [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|Vivian Galbraith]]; [[May McKisack]] reserved judgement, noting that "if he was indeed the author of the Anglo-Norman lament ascribed to him, he knew something of versification;" M.

Concerns continued to be raised over fresh plots to liberate the former King, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got at least as far as breaking into the prison within the castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=543<U+2013>544}}</ref> As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=546<U+2013>547}}</ref> The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=547}}</ref>

===Controversies===

Rumours and controversy rapidly surrounded Edward's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=55}}</ref> With Mortimer's execution in 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward had been murdered at Berkeley Castle. Later in the century, chroniclers suggested that he was suffocated and killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or [[poker]] into his [[anus]], and in the mid-1430s, this story was widely circulated through the Brut chronicle.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=88}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=562}}</ref> It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Modern historians have dismissed this account of Edward's death; the historian Michael Prestwich, for example, states that most of this story "belongs to the world of romance rather than of history".<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=88}}</ref>

Another set of controversial theories surround the possibility that Edward did not really die in 1327. These theories typically involve the "[[Fieschi Letter]]", sent to Edward III by an Italian priest called Manuel Fieschi, who claimed that Edward escaped Berkeley Castle in 1327 with the help of a servant, and ultimately retired to become a hermit in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=185<U+2013>188}}</ref> The body buried at Gloucester Cathedral was said to be that of the porter of Berkeley Castle, killed by the assassins and presented by them to Isabella as Edward's corpse to avoid punishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=186<U+2013>188}}</ref> The letter is often linked to an account of Edward III meeting with a man called William the Welshman in [[Antwerp]] in 1338, who claimed to be Edward II.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|p=213}}</ref>

Some parts of the letter's content are considered broadly accurate by historians, although other aspects of its account have been criticised as implausible.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=189<U+2013>208}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=222<U+2013>229}}</ref> A few historians, however, have supported versions of its narrative. The historian [[Paul C. Doherty|Paul Doherty]] questions the veracity of the letter and the identity of William the Welshman, but nonetheless has suspicions that Edward may have survived his imprisonment.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=213<U+2013>217}}</ref> The popular historian [[Alison Weir]] believes the events in the letter to be essentially true, using the letter to argue that Isabella was innocent of murdering Edward.<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2006|pp=285<U+2013>291}}</ref> The historian [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]] suggests that the story in Fieschi's letter is broadly accurate, but argues that it was in fact Mortimer and Isabella who had Edward secretly released, and who then faked his death, a fiction later maintained by Edward III when he came to power.<ref>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2005}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2008|pp=408<U+2013>410}}</ref> Ian Mortimer's account was critiqued by most scholars when it was first published, in particular by historian David Carpenter.<ref>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2008|p=408}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n11/david-carpenter/what-happened-to-edward-ii |title=What happened to Edward II? | last=Carpenter| first= David| publisher=Lrb.co.uk |accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|For critique of the theory that Edward II survived his imprisonment, see David Carpenter's review, and Roy Haines's analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n11/david-carpenter/what-happened-to-edward-ii |title=What happened to Edward II? | last=Carpenter| first= David| publisher=Lrb.co.uk |accessdate=20 April 2014}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=234<U+2013>237}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

Edward was ultimately a failure as a king; the historian Michael Prestwich observes that he "was lazy and incompetent, liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues, yet indecisive when it came to major issues", echoed by Roy Haines' description of Edward as "incompetent and vicious", and as "no man of business".<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=142, 164}}</ref> Edward did not just delegate routine government to his subordinates, but also higher level decision making, and Pierre Chaplais argues that he "was not so much an incompetent king as a reluctant one", preferring to rule through a powerful deputy, such as Piers Gaveston or Hugh Despenser the Younger.<ref>{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|pp=2<U+2013>3}}</ref> Edward's willingness to promote his favourites had serious political consequences, although he also attempted to buy the loyalty of a wider grouping of nobles through grants of money and fees.<ref>{{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|pp=31<U+2013>33, 154}}</ref> Edward could take a keen interest in the minutiae of administration, however, and on occasion engaged in the details of a wide range of issues across England and his wider domains.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=39}}</ref>

One of Edward's persistent challenges through most of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around <U+00A3>60,000 was still owing in the 1320s.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=93<U+2013>94}}</ref> The King worked his way through a large number of treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, and exploited often unpopular tax revenues, prises and taking out loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=94<U+2013>95}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=218<U+2013>219}}</ref> Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly, while cutting back on the expenses of his own household.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=37}}</ref>

Edward was responsible for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials.<ref>{{harvnb|Musson|2006|pp=140<U+2013>141}}</ref> It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but he appears to have involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322.<ref>{{harvnb|Musson|2006|pp=162<U+2013>163}}</ref> Edward made extensive use of [[Civil law (Roman)|Roman civil law]] during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning older principles of the [[English Common Law]].<ref>{{harvnb|Musson|2006|p=157}}</ref> Edward was also criticised from contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although how just widely they did so is unclear.<ref>{{harvnb|Musson|2006|pp=159<U+2013>160}}</ref> Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local [[gentry]]; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=148, 300<U+2013>301}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=161}}</ref>

Parliament grew in importance under Edward as a means of making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were "still as much an event as an institution".<ref>{{harvnb|Valente|1998|p=868}}; {{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=165<U+2013>166}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=50<U+2013>52}}</ref> After 1311, parliament began to include both the barons, and the representatives of the [[knight]]s and [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es: the latter grouping would in later years be termed the "[[House of Commons|commons]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=169, 172<U+2013>173}}</ref> Although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes, active opposition to Edward came largely from the barons, rather than parliament itself, although the barons did seek to use parliaments as a way of giving legitimacy to their long-standing political demands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=170<U+2013>171, 175<U+2013>177}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=32}}</ref> After resisting it for many years, Edward intervened increasing in Parliament in the second half of his reign to achieve his own political aims.<ref>{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=180<U+2013>182}}</ref> It remains unclear, however, whether Edward was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of the political classes alongside an existing parliament.<ref>{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=167<U+2013>168, 179}}</ref>

===Court===
[[File:Cambridge 1575 colour Trinity College.jpg|thumb|upright|1575 map showing the [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] (top left) founded by Edward]]
Edward's royal court was itinerant, travelling around the country with the King.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=64}}</ref> When housed in Westminster Palace, the court occupied a complex of two halls, seven chambers and three [[chapel]]s, along with other smaller rooms, but, due to the Scottish conflict, the court spent much of its time in Yorkshire and Northumbria.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=64<U+2013>65}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=33}}</ref> At the heart of the court was Edward's royal household, in turn divided into the "hall" and the "chamber"; the size of the household varied over time, but in 1317 was around 500 strong, including household knights, squires, kitchen and transport staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=63}}</ref> The household was surrounded by a wider group of courtiers, and appears to have also attracted a circle of prostitutes and criminal elements.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=63, 65}}</ref>

Music and minstrels were very popular at Edward's court, but hunting appears to have been a much less important activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=69, 72}}</ref> Edward was interested in buildings and paintings, but less so in literary works, which were not extensively sponsored at court.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=66<U+2013>68}}</ref> There was an extensive use of gold and silver plates, jewels and enameling at court, which would have been richly decorated.<ref name=Prestwich2006P69/>{{#tag:ref|Among his more esoteric valuables, Edward had a pitcher, allegedly made from a [[griffin]]'s egg.<ref name=Prestwich2006P69>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=69}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Edward kept a [[camel]] as a pet and, as a young man, took a [[lion]] with him on campaign to Scotland.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=75}}</ref> The court could be entertained in exotic ways: in 1312, Edward's court was entertained by an Italian [[snake-charmer]], and the following year by 54 nude French dancers.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=61, 69}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=75}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=33}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The historian Miri Rubin argues that the displays show a lack of royal decorum. The historian Michael Prestwich notes that these court events imply to many "a decadent extravagance, fitting the familiar stereotype of the king", but goes on to argue that the court was really "conventional, and perhaps even rather dull"; Seymour Phillips questions if the naked French dancers were genuinely extravagant or simply intended to fit in with local French royal culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=61, 74}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=75}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=33}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

===Religion===
Edward's approach to religion was normal for the period, and the historian Michael Prestwich describes him as "a man of wholly conventional religious attitudes".<ref name=Prestiwch2006P67>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=67}}</ref> There were daily chapel services and [[alms-giving]] at his court, and Edward blessed the sick, although he did this less often than his predecessors.<ref name=Prestiwch2006P67/> Edward remained close to the Dominican order who had helped to educate him, and followed their advice in asking for papal permission to be anointed with the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury in 1319; this request was refused, causing the King some embarrassment.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=65<U+2013>66}}</ref> Edward supported the expansion of the universities during his reign, establishing [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] in Cambridge to promote training in religious and civil law, [[Oriel College]] in Oxford and a [[Trinity College, Dublin#History|short-lived university in Dublin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Musson|2006|p=157}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=61<U+2013>62}}</ref>

Edward enjoyed a good relationship with the Pope Clement X, despite the King intervening repeatedly in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed.<ref>{{harvnb|Menache|2002|p=60}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=263}}</ref> With the support of Clement, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades.<ref>{{harvnb|Menache|2002|pp=66, 70<U+2013>71, 73}}</ref> The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' concerns for their own self-interest and protection.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p==337}}</ref>

[[Pope John XXII]] was elected in 1316, seeking Edward's support for a new crusade, and was therefore also inclined to support him politically.<ref name="Phillips 2011 263">{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=263}}</ref> In 1317, in exchange for papal support in his war with Scotland, Edward agreed to recommence paying the annual tribute to the Papacy which had been first agreed by [[John of England|King John]] in 1213; Edward soon ceased the payments, however, and the King never offered up homage, another part of the 1213 agreement.<ref name="Phillips 2011 263"/> In 1325 Edward asked John to instruct the Irish Church to openly preach in favour of his right to rule the island, and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=286}}</ref>

===Historiography===
[[File:Oriel College Charter.jpg|thumb|[[Oriel College]]'s 1326 charter from Edward]]
No chronicler for this period is entirely trustworthy or unbiased, often because their accounts were written to support a particular cause, but it is clear that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward.<ref>{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=36<U+2013>39}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=9}}</ref> The ''[[Polychronicon]]'', ''[[Vita Edwardi Secundi]]'', ''Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi'' and the ''Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon'' for example, all condemned the King's personality, habits and choice of companions.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=9<U+2013>14}}</ref> Other records from his reign show criticism of Edward by his contemporaries, including the Church and members of his own household.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=15<U+2013>17}}</ref> [[Political song]]s were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=17<U+2013>19}}</ref> Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and [[Thomas Ringstead]], rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=22<U+2013>23}}</ref>

Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries focused on Edward's relationship with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign and the events surrounding the relationship of the [[Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette|Duc d'<U+00C9>pernon]] and [[Henry III of France]], and between the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=24<U+2013>25}}</ref> In the first half of the 19th century, popular historians such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] popularised Edward's life with the [[Victorian era|Victorian public]], focusing on the King's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality.<ref>{{harvnb|Horne|1999|pp=34<U+2013>35}}</ref> From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values, and by the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons.<ref>{{harvnb|Horne|1999|pp=32, 40<U+2013>41}}</ref> Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.<ref name="Prestwich 2003 72"/>

By the end of the 19th century, more administrative records from the period had become available to historians such as [[William Stubbs]], [[Thomas Frederick Tout|Thomas Tout]] and J. C. Davies, who focused on the development of the English constitutional and governmental system during his reign.<ref name=WaughPhillipsP241>{{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=241}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=29}}</ref> Although critical of what they regarded as Edward's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward II, which they perceived as positive developments.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=35<U+2013>36}}</ref> During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century.<ref name=WaughPhillipsP241/> The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, [[John Maddicott]] and Seymour Phillips, re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts.<ref>{{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=241}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref> With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's younger life, and Natalie Fryde's study of Edward's final years, however, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the King were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|2006|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1985|p=103}}; {{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=241}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2005|p=1295}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/history/article750063.ece | title=Holy Fool | separator = ,| postscript =none | accessdate=22 April 2014 | last1= Given-Wilson | first1= Chris | website=Times Literary Supplement | publisher=Times Literary Supplement | year = 2010 }}</ref>

===Popular culture===
[[File:Edwardiiquarto.gif|thumb|upright|Title page of the earliest published text of ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (1594)]]
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Edward II of England}}

Several plays have shaped Edward's contemporary image.<ref name=Burgtorf2008P31>{{harvnb|Burgtorf|2008|p=31}}</ref> [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' was first performed around 1592, and focuses on Edward's relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites.<ref>{{harvnb|Lawrence|2006|p=206}}; {{harvnb|Martin|2010|pp=19<U+2013>20}}</ref> Marlowe presents Edward's death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does not describe the actual nature of Edward's murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a red-hot poker.<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|2010|pp=19<U+2013>20}}</ref> The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe's contemporaries [[James I of Scotland]] and Henry III of France, may have influenced [[William Shakespeare]]'s portrayal of [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Logan|2007|pp=83<U+2013>84}}; {{harvnb|Perry|2000|pp=1055<U+2013>1056, 1062<U+2013>1063}}</ref> In the 17th century, the playwright [[Ben Jonson]] picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, ''Mortimer His Fall''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lawrence|2006|p=206}}</ref>

The filmmaker [[Derek Jarman]] adapted the Marlowe play into a [[Edward II (film)|film]] in 1992, creating a [[postmodern]] [[pastiche]] of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies.<ref>{{harvnb|Burgtorf|2008|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Prasch|1993|p=1165}}</ref> In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the tradition in the Fieschi letter.<ref>{{harvnb|Prasch|1993|pp=1165<U+2013>1166}}</ref> Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting portrayal in [[Mel Gibson]]'s 1995 film ''[[Braveheart]]'', where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots.<ref>{{harvnb|Brintnell|2011|pp=40<U+2013>41}}; {{harvnb|Burgtorf|2008|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=31}}</ref> The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.<ref>{{harvnb|Aberth|2003|pp=303<U+2013>304}}</ref>

Edward's life has also been used in a wide variety of other media. The director [[David Bintley]] used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet ''[[Edward II (ballet)|Edward II]]'', first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms apart of composer [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]]'s symphony ''Edward II'', produced in 2000.<ref name=Burgtorf2008P31/> Novels such as John Penford's 1984 ''The Gascon'' and Chris Hunt's 1992 ''Gaveston'' have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while [[Stephanie Merritt]]'s 2002 ''Gaveston'' transports the story into the 20th century.<ref name=Burgtorf2008P31/> [[Marcus Stone]]'s painting ''Edward II and Piers Gaveston'' strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.<ref>{{harvnb|Horne|1999|pp=31, 40, 42}}</ref>
