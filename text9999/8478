'''Alexis Bachelot''' (born '''John Augustine Bachelot''', February 22, 1796&nbsp;<U+2013> December 5, 1837) was a [[Roman Catholic priest]] best known for his tenure as the first [[Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands|Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands]]. In that role, he led the first permanent Catholic [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Bachelot was raised in France, where he attended the [[Irish College in Paris]], and was ordained a priest in 1820. He led the first Catholic mission to Hawaii, arriving in 1827. Although he had expected the approval of then Hawaiian King [[Kamehameha&nbsp;II]], he learned upon arrival that Kamehameha&nbsp;II had died and a new government that was hostile towards Catholic missionaries had been installed. Bachelot, however, was able to convert and then quietly minister to a small group of Hawaiians for four years before being deported in 1831 on the orders of [[Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu]], the ''[[Kuhina Nui]]'' (a position similar to [[regent|queen regent]]) of Hawaii.

Bachelot then traveled to California, where he served as an assistant minister while pastoring and teaching. In 1837, having learned of Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu's death and King [[Kamehameha&nbsp;III]]'s willingness to allow Catholic priests on the island, Bachelot returned to Hawaii, intending to continue his missionary work. However, by Bacehlot's arrival, Kamehameha&nbsp;III had again changed his mind and Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months.  He was freed only after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor. Although he was later able to secure passage on a ship to [[Micronesia]], he died en route and was buried on an islet near [[Pohnpei]]. His treatment in Hawaii prompted the [[July Monarchy|government of France]] to dispatch a frigate to the island; the resulting intervention is known as [[French Incident (Hawaii)|The French Incident]] and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii.

==Early life==
Jean Augustin Bachelot was born in [[Saint-Cyr-la-Rosi<U+00E8>re]], [[Orne]], France on February 22, 1796.<ref name=pw208>Pietrusewsky & Willacker 1997, p. 208.</ref> In 1806, he left home for Paris, where he enrolled in the Preparatory [[Seminary]] of Piepus to pursue priesthood. In 1813, he [[Profession (religious)|professed]] at the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]],<ref name=y6/> taking the name Alexis.<ref name=pw208/> He studied at the Irish College in Paris before being [[Holy Orders|ordained]] as a priest in 1820. As a priest, he initially served as the College's [[rector]] and later led the preparatory seminary at [[Tours]].<ref name=y6>Yzendoor 1914, p. 6.</ref>

==Hawaiian mission==
In the early 1820s, [[Jean Baptiste Rives]], a French adviser to the Hawaiian king [[Kamehameha&nbsp;II]], traveled to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii. Members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were receptive to his idea,<ref name=k139/> and in 1825, [[Pope Leo&nbsp;XII]] assigned them the task of evangelizing Hawaii.<ref name=g49>Garrett 1982, p. 49.</ref> Bachelot was appointed the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, and in this role led the first permanent mission to Hawaii.<ref name=g50>Garrett 1982, p. 50.</ref>

The expedition was organized by the influential [[Monneron family]] and funded by the [[Bourbon Restoration|government of France]]. Bachelot was assisted in his new position by fellow priests [[Patrick Short]] and [[Abraham Armand]], as well as several [[lay brother]]s. The mission sailed from [[Bordeaux]] on the ''La Com<U+00E8>te'' in November&nbsp;1826.  The missionaries were initially accompanied by a group that planned to explore commercial trading opportunities<ref name=k139>Kuykendall 1938, p. 139.</ref> but returned to France after reaching Mexico.<ref name=m934>Mulholland 1970, pp. 93<U+2013>4.</ref>
[[File:Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace east.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]] in 2006]]
Unbeknownst to Bachelot, political changes occurred in Hawaii prior to the mission's arrival. King {{nowrap|Kamehameha II}} died in 1824 and his younger brother {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} became king.<ref name=k138>Kuykendall 1938, p. 138.</ref>  Because {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} was young at the time of his ascension, Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu (their stepmother) ruled as ''Kuhina Nui''.<ref name=k1334>Kuykendall 1938, pp. 133<U+2013>4.</ref> On the advice of [[Hiram Bingham I|Hiram {{nowrap|Bingham I}}]]<U+2014>a Protestant missionary who had converted the Hawaiian royalty four years previously<U+2014>Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu took a hard stance against Catholicism. Rives' influence on the Hawaiian government had faded,<ref name=k140/> and he never returned to Hawaii.<ref name=k140/>

The ''La Com<U+00E8>te'' arrived in [[Honolulu]] on July&nbsp;7, 1827. The priests were faced with a situation of dire poverty owing to the absence of Rives' patronage.<ref name=g50/> Furthermore, they had promised the ''La Com<U+00E8>te's'' captain that Rives would pay for their passage after they arrived in Hawaii, but by the time of their arrival, Rives had already left Hawaii.<ref name=m94>Mulholland 1970, p. 93.</ref> Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu refused to allow the missionaries to stay in Hawaii, suspecting them to be covert agents of the government of France.<ref name=g50/>  She instructed the ''La Com<U+00E8>te's'' captain to take the mission with him when he departed.<ref name=k140/> The captain, however, refused to do so because he did not receive payment for their passage, so the party was able to remain.<ref name=k140>Kuykendall 1938, p. 140.</ref>  The priests began their missionary work, but encountered suspicion from most chiefs. The members of the party had great difficulty defending themselves, as none of them were fluent in English or Hawaiian.<ref name=g50/> The group received a favorable response, however, when they met high chief [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]],<ref name=g49/> the royal governor of Oahu, and his wife [[Kuini Liliha]]. (The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu.) Boki welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay.<ref name=g49/>

For several months, Bachelot and his fellow missionaries lived in three small rented structures,<ref name=k140/> saying their first mass on the island in a grass hut.<ref name=k335/> They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased,<ref name=k140/> where the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]]<ref name=t45/> was dedicated in 1843.<ref name=k337>Kelley 1948, p. 337</ref> After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the [[Hawaiian language]].<ref name=t45>Tabrah 1984, p. 45.</ref> During their mission's first two years, the group converted 65 Hawaiians<ref name=t45/> and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted.<ref name=g51>Garrett 1982, p. 51.</ref> They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution.<ref name=k335/> The priests' vestments and rituals made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.<ref name=g51/>

Bachelot introduced two plant species to Hawaii: ''[[Prosopis humilis]]''<ref name=Hall/> and the ''[[Bougainvillea]]''.<ref name=scott>Scott 1991, p. 55.</ref> ''Prosopis humilis'' trees later covered thousands of acres there.<ref name=Hall>Hall 1904, p. 9.</ref> He had obtained the seeds, which were originally gathered by Catholic missionaries in California, from the Royal Conservatory in Paris.<ref name=t45/> Bachelot translated a prayer book into Hawaiian (''O Ke A'o Ana Kristiano'', "Christian Doctrine", c. 1831),<ref name=f19>Forbes 2000, p. 19.</ref> authored a [[catechism]] in Hawaiian (''He <U+014C>lelo Ho'ona'auao'', "A Word of Instruction", 1831),<ref name=f15>Forbes 2000, p. 15.</ref> and wrote an introduction to Hawaiian grammar in French (''Notes Gramaticales'', "Grammatical Notes", 1834).<ref name=f87>Forbes 2000, p. 87.</ref>

==Persecution==
[[File:Reine Cahoumanou.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1816 painting of Queen [[Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu]], who deported Bachelot from Hawaii in 1831]]
By 1827, Protestant Christianity, and in particular Bingham's teachings,<ref name=t456>Tabrah 1984, pp. 45<U+2013>6.</ref> had become the ''de facto'' state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii.<ref name=k140/> Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, by, for example, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize.<ref name=t456/> In December&nbsp;1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave on a ship, the ''Waverly'', bound for North America.<ref name=k142>Kuykendall 1938, p. 142.</ref> Though Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed her as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.<ref name=k133>Kuykendall 1938, p. 133.</ref>

The news of Bachelot and Short's expulsion caused controversy in the United States, where it was viewed as a violation of the rights appertaining to foreigners in the 1826 treaty signed by Commodore [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]] of the [[United States Navy]] and King {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}}. U.S. Navy Commodore [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]] protested the expulsions while in discussion with chiefs during his 1832 visit to the kingdom.<ref name=k144>Kuykendall 1938, p. 144.</ref>

==California==
[[File:Portrait of young King Kamehameha III (PP-97-7-010).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Portrait of the young King {{nowrap|[[Kamehameha III]]}}]]
The ''Waverly'' landed at a vacant area near San Pedro, Los Angeles, in January&nbsp;1832.<ref name=ol66>Older 1938, p. 66.</ref> Bachelot and Short traveled to the Mission San Gabriel Arc<U+00E1>ngel,<ref name=k143/> where they were welcomed by the [[Franciscans]] who staffed the mission.<ref name=k335>Kelley 1948, p. 335</ref> Bachelot later became the pastor of a church in Los Angeles,<ref name=ol67>Older 1938, p. 67.</ref> served as an assistant minister for the mission,<ref name=b317>Bancroft 1902, p. 317.</ref> and led the mission on an interim basis after its priest was reassigned in 1834.<ref name=ol67/> He also taught in Los Angeles schools during a teacher shortage.<ref name=g180/> He ministered in California until 1837<ref name=k143>Kuykendall 1938, p. 143.</ref> and became popular with Angelenos.<ref name=g180/>

In 1833, the [[Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] reorganized the jurisdiction of [[Oceania]]. Hawaii became part of the newly created [[Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Oceania]], which was split into northern and southern divisions. Bachelot remained as the Prefect Apostolic for the northern division. Bishop [[Etienne Jerome Rouchouze]] served as the Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania and oversaw Bachelot's assignment in Hawaii.<ref name=k143/>

In 1835 and 1836, two representatives of the Catholic Church traveled to Hawaii in an attempt to ascertain whether Bachelot could return.<ref name="k144<U+2013>145">Kuykendall 1938, pp. 144<U+2013>5.</ref> Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu had died in 1832, and the following year King {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} began making radical changes to Hawaiian law.<ref name=k1334/> Columban Murphy, a Catholic lay brother from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], visited King {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} in 1835 and discussed the possibility of Bachelot's return.<ref name=g53/> Finding King {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} amenable to the idea, Murphy traveled to California to relay the news. He was unable, however, to locate Bachelot, who was absent from the area at the time. After Bachelot received Murphy's message, Bachelot and Short decided to return to Hawaii.<ref name=g53>Garrett 1982, p. 53.</ref> The [[Ayuntamiento]] in Los Angeles, a municipal council, attempted to dissuade Bachelot<ref name=b318>Bancroft 1902, p. 318.</ref> and asked the Catholic leadership in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to prevent him from leaving,<ref name=g180>Gonz<U+00E1>lez 2005, p. 180.</ref> but he insisted on departing<ref name=b318/> and the Catholic leadership did not prevent him.<ref name=g180/>

==Final years==
[[File:Louis-Jules Masselot, Assembl<U+00E9>e des Chefs des Iles Sandwich en conf<U+00E9>rence avec le Commandant de la V<U+00E9>nus.jpg|thumb|right|1837 painting of King [[Kamehameha&nbsp;III]] meeting with Captain [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars|Du Petit Thouars]] and Captain [[Edward Belcher]]]]
When Bachelot and Short arrived in Honolulu in May 1837, they spent only 13 days on the island. Notwithstanding the agreement he had signed with [[French Navy|French Naval]] Captain [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]] that allowed French citizens to live on the island,<ref name=M214>McDougall 2004, p. 214.</ref> King {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} sought to deport the priests. Bachelot and Short were confined to the ship on which they had arrived, the ''Clementine'',<ref name=rw/> on {{nowrap|May 22}}.<ref name=d68/> However, the ''Clementine'''s captain, Jules Dudoit, refused to transport them from Hawaii.<ref name=rw>Rayson & Wong 1987, pp. 105<U+2013>6.</ref> Dudoit, a British citizen of French descent, met with Charlton and they publicly protested the priests' confinement.<ref name=d68>Daws 1968, p. 95.</ref> Their efforts to secure freedom for the priests to live on the island were unsuccessful<ref name=g53/> until the British naval vessel HMS ''Sulphur'' and the French frigate the ''La V<U+00E8>nus'' arrived in Honolulu<ref name=d68/> on {{nowrap|July 8}}.<ref name=k149>Kuykendall 1938, p. 149.</ref> The ships were commanded respectively by [[Edward Belcher]] and Dupetit Thouars, who each tried to convince the authorities to allow the priests to return to the island. After negotiations proved futile, they blockaded the harbor, boarded the ''Clementine'', and brought Bachelot and Short ashore. The ''La V<U+00E8>nus'' sent 300 sailors to escort them from the harbor to the French mission. King {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} agreed to allow the priests to stay in Honolulu until they could find a ship to transport them elsewhere, under the condition that they refrained from proselytizing.<ref name=d68/>

That year, Bachelot, who suffered from a form of [[rheumatism]],<ref name=g54>Garrett 1982, p. 54.</ref> became very sick.<ref name=k336>Kelley 1948, p. 336</ref> By November&nbsp;1837, he had recovered sufficiently to leave Hawaii. He purchased a ship<ref name=g54/> and sailed toward Micronesia, intending to work on a mission.<ref name=g53/> Bachelot's health significantly worsened after leaving Hawaii<ref name=pw208/> and he died at sea on December 5, 1887.<ref name=k150>Kuykendall 1938, p. 150.</ref> He was buried on an islet off the coast of Pohnpei. In 1838, a small chapel was built near his grave.<ref name=pw208/>

Owing to the persecution of Bachelot and his fellow priests, the government of France sent the frigate ''Art<U+00E9>mise'' to Hawaii in 1839. Its captain, [[Cyrille Pierre Th<U+00E9>odore Laplace]], had been instructed to force the government to stop persecuting Catholics. In response to this show of force, King {{nowrap|Kamehameha III}} [[Edict of Toleration (Hawaii)|granted Catholics]] freedom of religion.<ref name=k165>Kuykendall 1938, p. 165.</ref>
