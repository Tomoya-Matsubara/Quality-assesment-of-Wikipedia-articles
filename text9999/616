'''''Off the Air''''' is an American [[anthology series|anthology television series]] created by [[Dave Hughes (producer)|Dave Hughes]] for [[Adult Swim]]. The series is presented without explanation or narration as a showcase of surreal footage arranged around a single loose theme (expressed in the episode title) and blended without pause into a single continuous presentation. Hughes, a former employee of [[MTV Animation]], first pitched the series to the network through [[Mike Lazzo]] after producing a [[video mixtape]] for their 2010 ''Carnival Tour'' event. As a result of its 4&nbsp;a.m. [[graveyard slot]] and small selection of episodes, the series remains relatively unknown on the network, but has been received positively and dubbed a [[cult phenomenon]] by critics and the network.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Off the Air "Animals" snapshot.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from the pilot episode "Animals", showing morphing psychedelic imagery between two clips]]
The series is presented without explanation or narration as a showcase of surreal footage<U+2014>animations, short films, [[music video]]s, [[viral video]]s, film and TV clips, [[stock footage]] and morphing [[Psychedelia|psychedelic imagery]]<U+2014>arranged around a single loose theme (expressed in the episode title) and blended without pause into a single continuous presentation.

==Production==
Series creator Dave Hughes first started working for Adult Swim in 2003 after an eight-year stint with [[MTV Animation]], where he had edited series such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]''.<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|84}} Hughes, who saw the former network "slipping away from its more experimental roots" as it got popular,<ref name="MeAulwurm 2012" /> had the concept for ''Off the Air'' in mind before, but never thought he would be the one to make it. While living in New York, ''[[120 Minutes]]'', ''[[Concrete TV]]'', ''[[Liquid Television]]'',<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|85}}<ref name="MeAulwurm 2012" /> and ''[[Night Flight (TV series)|Night Flight]]'' were among some of the experimental programming that exposed him "to a whole new world of ideas, music and people that I just didn't see anywhere else on television."<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|85}} Hughes first pitched the series to the network through [[Mike Lazzo]] sometime after late 2009, after producing a [[video mixtape]] that would be projected behind musical performers for the network's 2010 ''Carnival Tour'' event. He compiled footage for the mixtape using the [[Prelinger Archives]], as well as various online sources, and applied [[visual effects]] to them "until you didn't quite know what you were looking at."<ref name="MeAulwurm 2012" /> He originally imagined the series to exist as a "bizarre collection" of Internet and archival footage intertwined with clips from Adult Swim shows, "set to good music."<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|85}} He ultimately had to omit the latter material, however, as the network would still have to acquire licenses for their own series in [[derivative work]]s.<ref name="Adult Swim 2012a" /> He found that once they were gone, "the show really opened up."<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|86}}

In putting an episode together, Hughes seeks clips "with some kind of truth or integrity to them", opting for both [[viral video]]s in addition to ones with fewer view counts.<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|86}}{{efn|Original pieces are also commissioned.<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|89}}}} Tracking down licensees for clips proves to be the most difficult aspect of the process, he stated, with co-producers Cody DeMatteis and Alan Steadman assisting him in pursuit of material hard to obtain.<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|86<U+2013>87}}{{efn|Before Hughes explained his process, Colin Foord of the Miami-based art collective Coral Morphologic, whose short film ''Oyster Vision'' is featured in the second episode, said he was unsure how producers sought after his film. He posited that they found it through their [[Vimeo]] account or their exposure at the [[Borscht Film Festival]].<ref name="McCorquodale 2011" />}} When asked if getting consent for other's work posed a challenge, Hughes noted it to be helpful working under the "Adult Swim banner", with only a few artists responding with reluctance. He wrote that each piece of the episode is treated with protection, not "trying to exploit anyone or make fun of anything or anybody."<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|86}} Each episode is edited using [[Final Cut Pro]], along with [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe After Effects]] for further manipulation.<ref name="MeAulwurm 2012" /> Hughes observed a large portion of producing episodes to stem from "finding the right music to go with the visuals, or vice versa",<ref name="Hughes 2014a" /> and found [[Film transition|transitions]] to "really help keep it moving."<ref name="Hughes 2014b" /> Hughes digressed from ''Liquid Television''{{'s}} use of longer segments in order to make the series a "larger event rather than a series of smaller events", and found visual effects and transitions to be "a huge part" of his theory in making an episode.<ref name="MeAulwurm 2012" />

A compilation of videos that were once considered to be featured in the first season had been published on the network's official blog.<ref name="Adult Swim 2012a" /><ref name="Adult Swim 2012b<U+2013>e" /> These videos, extending into its second season as well as hosting various other supplemental material, have since been published onto [[Network Awesome]].<ref name="Network Awesome 2013" />

==Broadcast and reception==
Its pilot episode, "Animals", premiered on Adult Swim on New Year's Day 2011 at 4&nbsp;a.m.; it was broadcast twice in a row, back-to-back. Episodes have continued to air in this time slot<U+2014>considered a [[graveyard slot]] in broadcast programming<U+2014>and as a result of this and its small selection of episodes, the series remains relatively unknown on the network. However, Austin McManus of ''[[Juxtapoz]]'' noted [[word of mouth]] to be "gradually spreading" about it.<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|82}} He and the network also described the show as a [[cult phenomenon]].<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|89}}<ref name="Turner Broadcasting System 2013" /> The series has received positive critical reception, with McManus conducting an eight-page interview and profile of Hughes in appreciation of the series.<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|82<U+2013>89}} The magazine had previously published a special issue centered around the network in July 2012, but overlooked the series, presenting an "opportunity to shed a little insight and background on an extraordinary unique show."<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|83}} Speaking from the first time he watched it, McManus praised the series for not being "your typical try-too-hard-to-be-weird production."<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|82}} Amanda McCorquodale of the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' joked that, for artists featured on the show, "nothing compares to the prestige of sharing a network with [[Tim & Eric]] and [[Brak (character)|Brak]], right?"<ref name="McCorquodale 2011" /> Ultimately, she saw it as the "already bizarre network's foray into out-there visual experimentation."<ref name="McCorquodale 2011" /> Writing for ''[[The Fader]]'', Matthew Trammell regarded it as "when things get really interesting."<ref name="Trammell 2014" /> PQ Ribber of ''[[The Overnightscape Underground]]'' dubbed the series a "modern version" of ''Liquid Television'' and called it "really kinda spiffy, and trippy, and cool."<ref name="Ribber 2014" />

Ratings-wise, several episodes have surpassed one million views according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].<ref name="Berman 2012a<U+2013>b, Pucci 2013, Pucci 2014a<U+2013>b" /> Hughes added that he follows the series' ratings when it occurs to him, but does not receive further [[analytics]].<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|88}} He found it to trend on Twitter during the weeks of its airing, and likes viewing user's statuses regarding it. In particular, he enjoys reactions from people who wake up to the series after falling asleep to the network, and judged from the online response that its audience would be "pretty young, late teens, early 20s" and "strangely positive and engaged."<ref name="McManus 2014" />{{rp|88}} The network has broadcast praise of the show written by viewers in the form of [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]], often hinting at further episodes being produced.<ref name="Adult Swim 2011a<U+2013>c" /> A continuous [[Streaming media|online stream]] of the show was launched by the network on September 5, 2014.<ref name="Adult Swim 2014" />
