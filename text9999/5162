'''France''' was a pioneer in the '''automotive industry''' and is the [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|10th-largest automobile manufacturer in the world by 2011 unit production]] and the third-largest in Europe (after [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]).<ref name=OICA/><ref name=WMVD/><ref name=RITA/><ref name=FREY/><ref name=IMF2000/><ref name=UAM/><ref name=Mich/>

France is home to two major automaking companies - [[PSA Peugeot Citro<U+00EB>n]] (owner of the [[Peugeot]] and [[Citroen]] marques) and [[Renault|Renault S.A.]] (owner of the Renault marque and of [[Dacia]] of Romania, and [[Renault Samsung Motors]] of South Korea). The France-based [[Renault Trucks]] is a major producer of commercial vehicles and is owned by [[Volvo AB]]. Both PSA Peugeot Citro<U+00EB>n and Renault produce a large number of vehicles outside of France.

French-designed cars have won the [[European Car of the Year]] and [[World Car of the Year]] awards numerous times. The [[Citro<U+00EB>n DS]] took third place in [[Car of the Century]] award and has been named the most beautiful car of all time by ''[[Classic & Sports Car]]'' magazine.<ref name="nytimes">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DF1439F937A15751C1A96F958260 "This Just In: Model T Gets Award"], James G.
