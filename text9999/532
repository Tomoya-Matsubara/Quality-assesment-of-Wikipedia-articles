'''Yuri Valentinovich Knorosov''' (alternatively, '''Knorozov'''; in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''<U+042E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0412><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+041A><U+043D><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0437><U+043E><U+0432>''; b. [[November 19]][[1922]] <U+2014> d. [[March 31]] [[1999]]) was a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[epigraphy|epigrapher]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]], who is renowned for the pivotal role his research played in the decipherment of the [[Maya script]], the [[writing system]] used by the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]].

== Early life ==
He was born in a village near [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]] in present-day [[Ukraine]], at that time the capital of the newly-formed [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].<ref>The Ukrainian SSR was incorporated as a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]] on [[December 30]], [[1922]], barely a month after Knorosov's birth. Among other momentous changes, the Republic was also suffering from the after-effects of the [[Russian famine of 1921]].</ref> His parents were [[Russians|Russian]] intellectuals, and his paternal grandmother had been a stage actress of national repute in [[Armenia]].<ref>Under the pseudonym "<U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438> <U+0417><U+0430><U+0431><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C>" ("Mary Zabel"). See People's History (n.d.), <U+0414><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+044F><U+044F> <U+041C><U+0435><U+0437><U+043E><U+0410><U+043C><U+0435><U+0440><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430> (2000).</ref> At school, the young Yuri was a difficult and somewhat eccentric student, who made indifferent progress in a number of subjects and was almost expelled for poor and wilful behaviour. However it became clear that he was academically bright with an inquisitive temperament; he was an accomplished violinist, wrote romantic poetry and could draw with accuracy and attention to detail. At the age of 17, Knorosov left Kharkov for [[Moscow]] where he commenced undergraduate studies at [[Moscow State University]], specialising in [[Egyptology]] at the faculty of Ethnology (Hammond 1999, People's History n.d.)

As a young man, Knorosov served in the [[Red Army]] during [[World War II]] as an artillery spotter. By some accounts he took part in the final push into [[Berlin]] during May, [[1945]], although later sources question this. Nevertheless, the following well-known anecdote has been published, possibly as a retrospective "embellishment" to his biography: the story goes that during this exercise he and his unit passed by the National Library as it was being consumed in a blaze. Knorosov apparently managed to retrieve from the building a one-volume edition containing copies of the three [[Maya codices]] which were then known. He later said that this chance discovery piqued his later lifelong interest in the subject area, although exactly how this work came into his possession is sometimes disputed. 

After the war, Knorosov enrolled at the Russian Institute of Ethnography in Leningrad (present-day [[Saint Petersburg]]) to study ancient languages, specialising in [[comparative linguistics]]. At the instigation of a professor there, Knorosov wrote his dissertation on the "[[de Landa alphabet]]", a record produced by the [[16th Century]] Spanish [[Diego de Landa|Bishop Diego de Landa]] in which he claimed to have transliterated the Spanish alphabet into corresponding Maya hieroglyphs, based on input from [[Maya peoples|Maya]] informants. De Landa, who during his posting to [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]] had overseen the destruction of all the codices from the [[Maya civilization]] he could find, reproduced his alphabet in a work (''Relaci<U+00F3>n de las Cosas de Yucat<U+00E1>n'') intended to justify his actions once he had been placed on trial when recalled to Spain. The original document had disappeared, and this work was unknown until [[1862]] when an abridged copy was discovered in the archives of the Spanish Royal Academy by the French scholar, [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]].

Since de Landa's "alphabet" seemed to be contradictory and unclear (e.g., multiple variations were given for some of the letters, and some of the symbols were not known in the surviving inscriptions), previous attempts to use this as a key for deciphering the Maya writing system had not been successful.

== Key research ==
[[image:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|260px|the page from [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''Relaci<U+00F3>n de las Cosas de Yucat<U+00E1>n'' (1853 edition by [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg|Brasseur de Bourbourg]]), which contained description of the ''[[de Landa alphabet]]'' which Knorosov relied upon for his breakthrough.]]
In [[1952]] Knorosov published a paper which was later to prove to be a seminal work in the field (''Drevnyaya pis<U+2019>mennost<U+2019> Tsentral<U+2019>noy Ameriki'', or "Ancient Writing of Central America".) The general thesis of this paper put forward the observation that early [[writing system|scripts]] such as [[Egyptian hieroglyph|ancient Egyptian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] which were generally or formerly thought to be predominantly [[logogram|logographic]] or even purely [[ideogram|ideographic]] in nature, in fact contained a significant [[phonetic]] component. That is to say, rather than the [[grapheme|symbols]] representing only or mainly whole words or concepts, many symbols in fact represented the sound elements of the language in which they were written, and had [[alphabet]]ic or [[syllabary|syllabic]] elements as well, which if understood could further their [[decipherment]]. By this time, this was largely known and accepted for several of these, such as Egyptian hieroglyphs (the decipherment of which was famously commenced by [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Champollion]] in [[1822]] using the tri-lingual [[Rosetta Stone]] artefact); however the prevailing view was that Mayan did not have such features. Knorosov's studies in comparative linguistics drew him to the conclusion that the Mayan script should be no different from the others, and that purely logographic or ideographic scripts were not actually so.

Knorosov's key insight was to treat the Maya glyphs represented in de Landa's alphabet not as an alphabet, but rather as a syllabary. He was perhaps not the first to propose a syllabic basis for the script, but his arguments and evidence were the most compelling to date. He maintained that when de Landa had commanded of his informant to write the equivalent of the Spanish letter "b" (for example), the Maya scribe actually produced the glyph which corresponded to the ''syllable'', /bay/, as spoken by de Landa. Knorosov did not actually put forward many new transcriptions based on his analysis, nevertheless he maintained that this approach was the key to understanding the script. In effect, the de Landa "alphabet" was to become almost the "Rosetta stone" of Mayan decipherment.

A further critical principle put forward by Knorosov was that of [[synharmony]]. According to this, Mayan words or syllables which had the form consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) were often to be represented by two glyphs, each representing a CV-syllable (i.e., CV-CV). In the reading, the vowel of the second was meant to be ignored, leaving the reading (CVC) as intended. The principle also stated that when choosing the second CV glyph, it would be one where the vowel sound matched that of the first glyph syllable. Later analysis has proved this to be largely correct.

== Critical reactions to his work ==
Upon the publication of this work from a then hardly-known scholar, Knorosov and his thesis came under some severe and at times dismissive criticism. [[J. Eric S. Thompson]], the noted British scholar regarded by all as the leading [[Mayanist]] of his day, led the attack. Thompson's views at that time were solidly anti-phonetic, and his own large body of detailed research had already fleshed-out a view that the Maya inscriptions did not record their actual history, and that the glyphs were founded on [[ideogram|ideographic]] principles. His view was the prevailing one in the field, and many other scholars followed suit. 

The situation was further complicated by Knorosov's paper appearing during the height of the [[Cold War]], and many were able to dismiss his paper as being founded on misguided [[Marxist]]-[[Leninist]] ideology and polemic. Indeed, in keeping with the mandatory practices of the time, Knorosov's paper was prefaced by a foreword written by the journal's editor which contained  digressions and propagandist comments extolling the State-sponsored approach by which Knorosov had succeeded where Western scholarship had failed. However, despite claims to the contrary by several of Knorosov's detractors, Knorosov himself never did include such polemic in his writings.  

Knorosov persisted with his publications in spite of the criticism and rejection of many Mayanists of the time. He was perhaps shielded to some extent from the ramifications of peer disputation, since his position and standing at the institute was not adversely influenced by criticism from Western academics.

== Progress of decipherment ==
During the [[1960s]], other Mayanists and researchers began to expand upon Knorosov's ideas. Their further field-work and examination of the extant inscriptions began to indicate that actual Maya history was recorded in the [[stela]]e inscriptions, and not just [[Maya calendar|calendric]] and [[astronomy|astronomical]] information. The Russian-born but American-resident scholar [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] was foremost in this work, eventually convincing Thompson and other doubters that historical events were recorded in the script.

Other early supporters of the phonetic approach championed by Knorosov included [[Michael D. Coe]] and [[David Humiston Kelley|David Kelley]], and whilst initially they were in a clear minority, more and more supporters came to this view as further evidence and research progressed.

Through the rest of the decade and into the next, Proskouriakoff and others continued to develop the theme, and utilising Knorosov's results and other approaches began to piece together some decipherments of the script. A major breakthrough came during the first round table or [[Mesa Redonda]] conference at the Maya site of  [[Palenque]] in [[1973]], when using the syllabic approach those present (mostly) deciphered what turned out to be a list of former rulers of that particular Maya city-state.

Subsequent decades saw many further such advances, to the point now where quite a significant portion of the surviving inscriptions can be read. Most Mayanists and accounts of the decipherment history apportion much of the credit to the impetus and insight provided by Knorosov's contributions, to a man who had not as yet set foot outside of his native Russia, but had still been able to make important contributions to the understanding of this distant, ancient civilisation.

== Later life ==
As his theories became more widely known, Knorosov was in 1956 granted leave to attend an international convention of Mesoamerican scholars in [[Copenhagen]]. This was to be his one and only venture outside the Soviet Union for quite some time, since as a [[Soviet]] academic, Knorosov was subject to the usual restrictions placed on travel outside of the Soviet Union. Over subsequent years western Mayanists needed to travel to Leningrad to meet up with him. It was not until [[1990]] that he was eventually able to leave Russia again and finally visit the ancient Maya homelands and archaeological sites in [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. This was at the invitation of the Guatemalan President [[Vinicio Cerezo|Marco Vinicio Cerezo Ar<U+00E9>valo]], at a time of improved diplomatic relations between the two countries. Cerezo presented him with an honorary medal, and Knorosov was able to extend his stay in the region, visiting several of the important Maya sites such as [[Tikal]]. However, shortly after Vinicio Cerezo left office, Knorosov received threats from suspected right-wing militarist groups who were antagonistic to the indigenous Mayan peoples, and was forced to go into hiding and then leave the country.

Knorosov had broad interest in, and contributed to, other investigative fields such as archaeology, semiotics, human migration to the Americas and the evolution of the mind. However, it is his contributions to the field of Maya studies for which he is best remembered.

In his very last years, Knorosov is also known{{fact}} to have pointed to a place in the [[United States of America|United States]] as the likely location of [[Chicomoztoc]], the ancestral land from which --according to ancient documents and accounts considered [[mythology|myth]]ical by a sizable number of scholars-- Indian peoples now living in Mexico are said to have come.

Knorosov died in St. Petersburg on March 31, 1999, of [[pneumonia]] in the corridors of a city hospital, just before he was due to receive the honorary [[Proskouriakoff Award]] from [[Harvard University]].
