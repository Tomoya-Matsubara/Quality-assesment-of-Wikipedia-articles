On August 18, 1937, a [[lightning]] strike started the '''Blackwater fire''' in [[Shoshone National Forest]], approximately {{convert|35|mi}} west of [[Cody, Wyoming]], United States. Fifteen firefighters were killed by the [[wildfire|forest fire]] when a [[Dry line|dry weather front]] caused the winds to suddenly increase and change directions. The fire quickly spread into dense forest, creating spot fires that trapped some of the firefighters in a [[firestorm]]. Nine firefighters died during the fire and six more died shortly thereafter from severe burns and respiratory complications, while another 38 firefighters were injured. The Blackwater fire killed the most wildland firefighters in the U.S. since the [[Great Fire of 1910]] and was not surpassed until 2013 when 19 firefighters died in the [[Yarnell Hill Fire]].

The Blackwater fire consumed {{convert|1700|acre}} of old-growth forest dominated by [[Douglas fir]] trees on the west slopes of [[Clayton Mountain]]. At the time the firestorm occurred, the temperatures were about {{convert|90|F|C}} and the relative humidity was only 6&nbsp;percent. Though most of the firefighters consisted of [[Civilian Conservation Corp]] (CCC) employees, they were led by more experienced [[United States Forest Service]] (USFS) fire managers. Firefighters in the first half of the 20th century used mostly hand tools to suppress wildfires, and all gear was carried by the firefighters or by pack animals. Weather forecasting and radio communication were generally poor or nonexistent.

Investigations and analysis of the event led the USFS to develop better ways to provide a more immediate response to combat fires; one of them was the development of the [[smokejumper]] program in 1939. Additionally, the ''[[Ten Standard Firefighting Orders]]'', a standardized set of wildland firefighting principles, were developed in 1957. A year after the tragedy, survivors and their fellow employees constructed several memorials at the scene of the incident.

==Geographical setting==
Blackwater Creek originates on the north slope of [[Sheep Mesa (Park County, Wyoming)|Sheep Mesa]] at an altitude of {{convert|11400|ft}} in [[Shoshone National Forest]] and flows north through Blackwater Canyon. The creek is {{convert|12|mi|abbr=on}} long and descends a steep gradient before it empties into the [[North Fork Shoshone River]], across from U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 14|14]]/[[U.S. Route 16|16]]/[[U.S. Route 20|20]] immediately west of [[Mummy Cave]] and {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} east of the border of [[Yellowstone National Park]].<ref name=gnis>{{cite gnis|id=1598235|name=Blackwater Creek|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref> The firestorm deaths occurred on the west slopes of [[Clayton Mountain]], approximately {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} south by trail into the canyon.<ref name=topo>{{Cite map|publisher=Topoquest (USGS Quads)|title=Clayton Mountain, WY|url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=44.41161&lon=-109.74129&datum=nad83&zoom=4|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name=besser>{{cite book|last=Besser|first=Brook|title=Wyoming Road Trip by the Mile Marker|publisher=Nightblaze Books|date=Nightblaze Books|page=91|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nrJL2CGHq8IC&pg=PA91&dq=blackwater+fire+trail#v=onepage&q=blackwater%20fire%20trail&f=false|isbn=978-0984409303}}</ref> The canyon consists of numerous [[ravine]]s and small ridges, which form a washboard landscape shaped by extensive erosion of the volcanic [[igneous]] rocks that constitute the [[Absaroka Range]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Absaroka Range|url=http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/research/stratigraphy/AbsarokaRange/Default.aspx|publisher=Wyoming State Geological Survey|accessdate=June 30, 2013|year=2013}}</ref> The canyon has moderate to steep slopes with a gradient of 20 to 60&nbsp;percent.<ref name=brown>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=A.A.|title=The Factors and Circumstances That Led to the Blackwater Fire Tragedy|journal=Fire Management Today|volume=63|issue=3|pages=11<U+2013>13|publisher=U.S Forest Service|year=2003|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/downloads/lsr5/lsr5_led_to_tragedy_dec1937.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> The regional flora is an upper [[Montane_ecology#Montane_forests|montane]] mixed-conifer forest dominated by [[Douglas fir]] trees.<ref name=brown/><ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=William L.|title=Fire Ecology in Rocky Mountain Landscapes|publisher=Island Press|date=September 26, 2012|page=196|isbn=9781610911917}}</ref> When the fire swept through  the area the forest was dense and mature with heavy fuel loads from dead trees, which also had dead limbs extending to the ground, providing a [[fuel ladder]] for fire to easily spread into the tree tops.<ref name=brown/>

The steepness and ruggedness of the terrain in Blackwater Canyon meant firefighters had to access the fire on foot, carrying all their supplies. On the Blackwater fire, pack horses were used to ferry supplies from the access roads to an upper base camp.<ref name=simpers>{{cite web|last=Simpers|first=Morris|title=The Blackwater Fire Camp|work=Rocky Mountain Region Bulletin|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/downloads/lsr5/lsr5_bulletin_oct1937.pdf|format=pdf|page=4|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> Many of the firefighters were employed by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) and had limited training in [[wildfire suppression]] and behavior, as the CCC was mainly engaged in construction projects. After a series of severe and deadly forest fire events in the early 20th century, officials established the ''10&nbsp;am rule'' in 1935, which recommended aggressive attack on all fires and to have them controlled by 10&nbsp;am, the day after they are first detected.<ref name=10am>{{cite web|title=Evolution of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy|work=Review and Update of the 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy January 2001|publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service|month=January|year=2001|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/branches/ppm/fpc/archives/fire_policy/docs/chp1.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref name=omi1>{{cite book|last=Omi|first=Phillip N.|title=Forest Fires: A Reference Handbook|chapter=Institutionalization of Fire Exclusion|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=May 23, 2005|page=67|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Ts_oE23Wu8C&lpg=PA67&dq=Institutionalization%20of%20Fire%20Exclusion&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=Institutionalization%20of%20Fire%20Exclusion&f=true|isbn=978-1851094387}}</ref> This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic.<ref name=omi2>{{cite book|last=Omi|first=Phillip N.|title=Forest Fires: A Reference Handbook|chapter=Institutionalization of Fire Exclusion|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=May 23, 2005|page=131|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Ts_oE23Wu8C&lpg=PA67&dq=Institutionalization%20of%20Fire%20Exclusion&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q=erratic&f=false|isbn=978-1851094387}}</ref> A scientific publication about fire behavior that could be used for widespread training of firefighters first became available in 1951.<ref name=brauneis/>

==Fighting the Blackwater fire==

===Detection and firefighter response===
The Blackwater fire was started by a [[lightning]] strike on August 18, 1937, but it remained undetected until early August 20, at which time it was estimated to be about {{convert|2|acre}} in size.<ref name=kidston/><ref name=leadership>{{cite web|title=Staff Ride to the Blackwater Fire|publisher=Wildland Fire Leadership Development Program|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/library_staff_ride5.html|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref> By the evening, it had expanded to {{convert|200|acre|abbr=on}}, and 65 firefighters from the [[United States Forest Service]] (USFS), which included CCC company 1852 from the Wapiti Ranger District of Shoshone National Forest and employees of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), were constructing fire lines along two flanks of the fire.<ref name=leadership/><ref name=blackwater1>{{cite web|title=Stand 1 <U+2013> Highway Memorial|publisher=Wildland Fire Leadership Development Program|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/lsr5_stand1.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> A gas-powered portable pump was delivered and set up using water from Blackwater Creek by midnight. Another pump arrived after that and firefighters installed {{convert|2000|ft|abbr=on}} of hose line on the north flank of the fire and another {{convert|5000|ft|abbr=on}} on the west flank. CCC workers from the National Park Service arrived at 2:30&nbsp;am on August 21 and started construction of fire line along the north flank of the fire. Meanwhile, increasing winds had begun expanding the fire to the east.<ref name=godwin1/>

Fire officials believed they needed more manpower, so CCC crews from [[Bighorn National Forest]], {{convert|165|mi|abbr=on}} to the east, and other districts of Shoshone National Forest started responding by the morning of August 21.<ref name=kidston/><ref name=fifield1>{{cite web|last=Fifield|first=Charles|title=Memorial Number Blackwater Fire|work=Rocky Mountain Region Bulletin|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/downloads/lsr5/lsr5_bulletin_oct1937.pdf|format=pdf|page=1|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> By 12:30&nbsp;pm, more than 200 firefighters were on duty and involved in digging fire line or in support of the firefighting effort.<ref name=godwin2>{{cite journal|last=Godwin|first=David P.|title=The Handling of the Blackwater Fire|journal=Fire Control Notes|volume=1|issue=6|pages=374|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|year=1937|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/downloads/lsr5/lsr5_handling_of_blackwater.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> Along one of the small creeks flowing into Blackwater Creek, a small dam was constructed to pocket water supplies for use in backpack water pumps.<ref name=blackwater3>{{cite web|title=Stand 3 <U+2013> Clayton Gulch|publisher=Wildland Fire Leadership Development Program|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/lsr5_stand3.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> Due to a long overnight journey, the CCC members from the Tensleep District of Bighorn National Forest did not commence response to the fire until after noon on August 21.<ref name=godwin1/><ref name=blackwater2>{{cite web|title=Stand 2 <U+2013> Trail Ridge|publisher=Wildland Fire Leadership Development Program|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/lsr5_stand2.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> As they arrived, the Tensleep CCC unit were told to relieve the Wapiti CCC unit that had been fighting the fire since the previous evening.<ref name=godwin3>{{cite journal|last=Godwin|first=David P.|title=The Handling of the Blackwater Fire|journal=Fire Control Notes|volume=1|issue=6|pages=378|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|year=1937|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/downloads/lsr5/lsr5_handling_of_blackwater.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> More than 50 firefighters commenced construction of a new fire line along Clayton Creek and Clayton Gulch, a ravine extending east from Blackwater Creek. The construction was led by USFS Rangers Alfred Clayton and Urban Post, and their crews consisted mainly of the Tensleep CCC camp and some from other entities.<ref name=brown/><ref name=blackwater2/>

Radio transmissions from [[Idaho]] to a weather service office in [[Riverton, Wyoming]], indicated a [[Dry line|dry weather front]] had pushed through and was heading east. It is believed that forest managers at the Wapiti ranger station received this information, but it did not reach the men on the fire lines because of a lack of radio lines.<ref name=kidston/> The USFS did have spotters in an aircraft providing aerial observation of the fire behavior that was radioed to the Wapiti ranger station. At 12:40&nbsp;pm on August 21, several spot fires were reported near the fire lines by aerial observers.<ref name=blackwater2/> At 1&nbsp;pm, the weather at Wapiti was {{convert|90|F|C}} with an extremely low relative humidity of 6&nbsp;percent. Winds blowing generally from the southwest increased to {{convert|30|mph}} as the dry front approached at 3:30&nbsp;pm. At 3:45&nbsp;pm, they shifted abruptly from southwest to west, causing increased crowning and spot fires over the fire lines. Convectional winds also increased and the fire front started up the drainage heading east.<ref name=brown/>

===Firefighters trapped by firestorm===
[[File:Clayton Gluch 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Clayton Gulch after the fire]]
Urban Post was leading the Tensleep CCC crews in and passed Alfred Clayton, who had only one firefighter with him. Post left six men to assist Clayton and the other firefighter so they could help suppress small fires that were spotting over the fire lines.<ref name=brown/> Post then led his crews east up a ridge but saw more spot fires below where Clayton and his crew were. Clayton also saw the spot fires and moved to suppress them. At 4&nbsp;pm, the spot fires started to crown and Clayton sent a handwritten note to Post requesting additional manpower.<ref name=blackwater3/> By the time the note reached Post, the [[firestorm]] commenced, racing east up the ravines and gullies and trapping Clayton and his crew near the dam they had built. There, Clayton and six others died. The eighth firefighter in his crew was rescued but died later in the hospital.<ref name=fifield2>{{cite web|last=Fifield|first=Charles|title=Memorial Number Blackwater Fire|work=Rocky Mountain Region Bulletin|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/downloads/lsr5/lsr5_bulletin_oct1937.pdf|format=pdf|page=2|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref>

Post led more than 40 firefighters, consisting of USFS, CCC, and BPR employees, up the ridge seeking an opening in the forest to take refuge.<ref name=blackwater4>{{cite web|title=Stand 4 <U+2013> Post Point|publisher=Wildland Fire Leadership Development Program|url=http://www.fireleadership.gov/toolbox/staffride/lsr5_stand4.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> Spot fires blew ahead of Post and his crews preventing them from advancing further up the ridge, but they found a rocky outcropping and laid prone on the ground as the fire engulfed them.<ref name=post>{{cite web|title=Statement by Ranger Urban J.

==Aftermath==

===Fire investigation and results===
The fatalties on the Blackwater fire led the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to initiate their earliest rigorous investigation on such an event.<ref name=leadership/> The USFS investigation of the Blackwater fire incident was led by David Godwin, Assistant Chief of Fire Control for the USFS.<ref name=brauneis2>{{cite journal|last=Brauneis|first=Karl|title=1937 Blackwater Fire Investigation: Boost For Smokejumpers?|journal=Fire Management Today|volume=62|issue=2|pages=24<U+2013>26|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|year=2002|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/fmt/fmt_pdfs/fmt62-2.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> His conclusions were that the firefighters were in good physical condition and most had some experience fighting forest fires.

These findings were reinforced by A.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Brown, head of the Division of Fire Control in the Forest Service<U+2019>s Rocky Mountain Region, who studied the fire behavior and the responses to the Blackwater fire.<ref name=brauneis2/>

[[File:Blackwater fire memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Dedication ceremony of the Blackwater fire roadside memorial along U.S. Routes 14/16/20]]
In an era when all fire was considered detrimental and with limited studies that documented the important ecological role of fire, immediate suppression using aggressive attack was considered the best way to protect the forests. Godwin believed that parachuting firefighters from airplanes as soon as fires were detected and as near to the fire as possible would provide the fastest way to get firefighters in place before a fire raged out of control. Consequently, by 1939 the first stages of the parachuting [[smokejumper]] program were initiated at [[Winthrop, Washington]], and at two locations in [[Montana]].<ref name=brauneis2/> A later review of 16 fatal fires, from the Blackwater fire in 1937 through 1956, led managers of the USFS to implement the ''[[Ten Standard Firefighting Orders]]'' in 1957, which were later changed to ''FIREORDERS'' in 1987, with each letter designating one of the ten orders.<ref name=brauneis3>{{cite journal|last=Brauneis|first=Karl|title=Fire Orders: Do You Know Their Original Intent?|journal=Fire Management Today|volume=62|issue=2|pages=27<U+2013>29|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|year=2002|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/fmt/fmt_pdfs/fmt62-2.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> Not long after the ''Ten Standard Firefighting Orders'' were implemented, ''18 Watchout Situations'' were also developed to increase firefighter safety.<ref name=scholz>{{cite journal|last=Scholz|first=Bryan|title=The 10 Standard Firefighting Orders and 18 Watch Out Situations: We Don't Bend Them, We Don't Break Them...We Don't Know Them|journal=Fire Management Today|volume=70|issue=1|pages=29<U+2013>31|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|year=2010|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/fmt/fmt_pdfs/FMT70-1.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Standard Firefighting Orders and 18 Watchout Situations|work=Fire and Aviation Management|publisher=U.S. Forest Service|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/safety/10_18/10_18.html|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> Decades after the Blackwater fire, forest managers had developed a better understanding of the ecological role of fire. Consequently, in 1977 the USFS dropped the 10&nbsp;am rule from their firefighting strategic planning as the agency moved from an emphasis on full wildfire suppression to one of wildfire management.<ref name=10am/>

===Memorials===
In 1938, several monuments were erected by members of the CCC to honor those killed and injured during the Blackwater fire. The largest and most accessible is along U.S. Routes 14/16/20.<ref name=blackwater1/> Another memorial was erected the same year near the location where Alfred Clayton and his crew perished.<ref name=blackwater3/> A third memorial was placed where Urban Post and his crews waited out the firestorm on the rocky ledge that was later named Post Point.<ref name=blackwater4/> Clayton also had several geographic locations named in his honor, including Clayton Mountain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Decisions of the United States Geographic Board|publisher=United States Geographic Board|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F40tAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA9-PA13&dq=clayton+mountain+named+after+alfred+clayton&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VlXcUYCkMrTKyQGQwoHwBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> Though only the roadside monument can be reached by car, the other two monuments can be accessed by trail, which is a {{convert|10|mi|adj=on}} round-trip hike.<ref name=besser/>
