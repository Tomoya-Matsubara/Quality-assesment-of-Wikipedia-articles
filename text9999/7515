Operated as a joint project between the five participant space agencies, the station's sections are controlled by mission control centres on the ground operated by the American [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RKA), the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA), and the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).<ref name="PartStates"/><ref name="ISSRG"/> The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements<ref name="ESA-IGA"/> that allow the [[Russian Federation]] to retain full ownership of [[Russian Orbital Segment|its own modules]],<ref name="RSA-MOU"/> with the [[US Orbital Segment|remainder of the station]] allocated between the other international partners.<ref name="ESA-IGA"/>  The station is serviced by [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft, [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft, space shuttles, the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] and the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]],<ref name="ISSRG"/> and has been visited by [[List of International Space Station visitors|astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations]].<ref name="10th"/> The cost of the station  has been estimated by ESA as <U+20AC>100 billion over 30 years,<ref name="costs"/> and, although  estimates range from 35 billion dollars to 160 billion dollars, the ISS is believed to be the [[List of world's most expensive single objects|most expensive object ever constructed]].<ref name="cost2"/> The financing, research capabilities and technical design of the ISS programme have been criticised because of the high cost.<ref name="Crit1"/><ref name="Crit2"/>

==Purpose==
The International Space Station (ISS) is an internationally developed satellite currently being assembled in [[Low Earth Orbit]]. Primarily a research laboratory, the ISS offers an advantage over spacecraft such as NASA's [[Space Shuttle]] because it is a long-term platform in the [[zero-g|space environment]], where extended studies are conducted.<ref name="10th"/><ref name="Worldbook at NASA"/> The presence of a permanent crew affords the ability to monitor, replenish, repair, and replace experiments and components of the spacecraft itself. Scientists on the ground have swift access to the crew's data and can modify experiments or launch new ones, benefits generally unavailable on specialised unmanned spacecraft.<ref name="Worldbook at NASA"/>

Crews, who fly [[List of International Space Station Expeditions|expeditions]] of several months' duration, conduct scientific experiments each day (approximately 160 man-hours a week).<ref name="ISS overview">{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/ISS_OVR/index.htm|title=International Space Station Overview|publisher=ShuttlePressKit.com|date=3 June 1999|accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="Science in School">{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceinschool.org/2008/issue10/iss|title=The International Space Station: life in space|publisher=Science in School|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref> As of the conclusion of [[Expedition 15]], 138 major science investigations had been conducted on the ISS.<ref name="Bergin">{{cite web|title=ISS: Still in assembly, producing science research accomplishments|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/08/iss-assembly-producing-science-research-accomplishments/|accessdate=27 September 2009|date=22 August 2009|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com}}</ref> Scientific findings, in fields from basic science to exploration research, are published every month.<ref name="ResProg">{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/Advanced/ISSResearch/|title=ISS Research Program|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 February 2009}}</ref>

The ISS provides a location in the relative safety of Low Earth Orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to [[the Moon]] and [[Mars]]. This provides experience in the maintenance, repair, and replacement of systems on-orbit, which will be essential in operating spacecraft further from Earth. Mission risks are reduced, and the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft are advanced.<ref name="ResProg"/>

Part of the crew's mission is educational outreach and international cooperation. The crew of the ISS provide opportunities for students on Earth by running student-developed experiments, making educational demonstrations, and allowing for student participation in classroom versions of ISS experiments, NASA investigator experiments, and ISS engineering activities. The ISS programme itself, with the international cooperation that it represents, allows 14 nations to live and work together in space, providing lessons for future multi-national missions.<ref name="ISSRG"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gro Mjeldheim Sandal and Dietrich Manzey|title=Cross-cultural issues in space operations: A survey study among ground personnel of the European Space Agency|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=65|issues=11<U+2013>12|date=December 2009|pages=1520<U+2013>1529|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.03.074}}</ref>

===Scientific research===

The ISS provides a platform to conduct experiments that require one or more of the unusual conditions present on the station. The primary fields of research include [[Zero_g#Health_effects_of_weightlessness|human research]], [[space medicine]], [[life science]]s, [[physical science]]s, [[astronomy]] and [[meteorology]].<ref name="ISS overview"/><ref name="NASA Fields of Research"/><ref name="NASA ISS Goals"/> The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2005|2005 NASA Authorization Act]] designated the American segment of the International Space Station as a national laboratory with the goal of increasing the use of the ISS by other federal agencies and the private sector.<ref>{{citeweb|title=NASA Authorization Act 2005|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ155.109.pdf|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|date=30 December 2005|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>

Research on the ISS improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body. Subjects currently under study include [[muscle atrophy]], [[Osteoporosis|bone loss]], and fluid shift. The data will be used to determine whether [[space colonisation]] and lengthy [[human spaceflight]] are feasible. As of 2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise (such as the six-month journey time required to [[Manned mission to Mars|fly to Mars]]).<ref name="JCB">{{cite book|author=Jay Buckey|title=Space Physiology|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|date=23 February 2006|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Space-Physiology-Jay-C-Buckey/dp/0195137256/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qisbn=1-227-46880-9&sr=8-1|isbn=978-0-19-513725-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17476-ion-engine-could-one-day-power-39day-trips-to-mars.html?full=true|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=8 January 2010|date=24 July 2009|author=List Grossman|title=Ion engine could one day power 39-day trips to Mars}}</ref>
Large scale medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS via the National Space and Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] study in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]]) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician onboard the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html|date=1 May 2009|accessdate=1 October 2009|author=Brooke Boen|publisher=NASA|title=Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sishir Rao ''et al''.|year=2008|title=A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine|journal=Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine|volume=27|pages=745<U+2013>749|url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745|pmid=18424650|issue=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Michael Fincke ''et al''.|year=2004|title=Evaluation of Shoulder Integrity in Space: First Report of Musculoskeletal US on the International Space Station|journal=Radiology|issue=234|pages=319<U+2013>322|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/234/2/319.abstract|pmid=15533948|doi=10.1148/radiol.2342041680|volume=234}}</ref>

Researchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. In response to some of this data, NASA wants to investigate [[microgravity]]'s effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human-like tissues, and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research"/>

The investigation of the physics of fluids in microgravity will allow researchers to model the behaviour of fluids better. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. In addition, an examination of reactions that are slowed by low gravity and temperatures will give scientists a deeper understanding of [[superconductivity]].<ref name="NASA Fields of Research"/>

The study of [[materials science]] is an important ISS research activity, with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad15sep99_1.htm|title=Materials Science 101|publisher=Science@NASA|accessdate=18 June 2009|date=15 September 1999}}</ref> Other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve our knowledge about energy production, and  lead to economic and environmental benefits. Future plans are for the researchers aboard the ISS to examine [[aerosol]]s, [[ozone]], [[water vapor|water vapour]], and [[oxide]]s in Earth's atmosphere, as well as [[cosmic ray]]s, [[cosmic dust]], [[antimatter]], and [[dark matter]] in the universe.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research"/>

The International Space Station represents a union of several national space station projects that originated during the [[Cold War]]. In the early 1980s, NASA planned to launch a modular space station called [[Space Station Freedom|''Freedom'']] as a counterpart to the Soviet ''[[Salyut program|Salyut]]'' and ''[[Mir]]'' space stations, while the Soviets were planning to construct [[Mir-2|''Mir''-2]] in the 1990s as a replacement for ''Mir''.<ref name="SSSM">
{{cite book|author=David Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387230114/ref=ord_cart_shr/202-3649698-1866219?%5Fencoding=UTF8&m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}</ref> Because of budget and design constraints, ''Freedom'' never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests.

With the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Space Race]], ''Freedom'' was nearly cancelled by the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The [[History of post-Soviet Russia|post-Soviet economic chaos]] in Russia led to the cancellation of ''Mir''-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed.<ref name="SSSM"/> Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the American government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project.<ref name="SSSM"/>

In June 1992 American president [[George H. W. Bush]] and Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] agreed to cooperate on [[space exploration]]. The resulting ''Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes'' called for a short, joint space programme, with one American [[astronaut]] deployed to the Russian space station ''Mir'' and two Russian [[Astronaut#Russia|cosmonauts]] deployed to a Space Shuttle.<ref name="SSSM"/>

In September 1993, American Vice-President [[Al Gore, Jr.]], and Russian Prime Minister [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] announced plans for a new space station, which eventually became the International Space Station.<ref name="gao">{{cite web|url=http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151975.pdf|title=''Space Station: Impact of the Expanded Russian Role on Funding and Research''|accessdate=3 November 2006|author=Donna Heivilin|date=21 June 1994|format=PDF|publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]]}}</ref> They also agreed, in preparation for this new project, that the United States would be heavily involved in the ''Mir'' programme as part of an agreement that later included [[Shuttle-Mir Program|Space Shuttle orbiters docking with ''Mir'']].<ref name="SMB"/>

According to the plan, the ISS programme would combine the proposed space stations of all participant agencies:  NASA's ''Freedom'', the RSA's ''Mir''-2 (with DOS-8 later becoming [[Zvezda (ISS)|''Zvezda'']]), [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] ''Columbus'', and the Japanese [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kib<U+014D>'']] laboratory. When the first module, ''Zarya'', was launched in 1998, the station was expected to be completed by 2003. Delays have led to a revised estimated completion date of 2011.<ref name="Manifest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|year=2008}}</ref>

The tour then proceeds through PMA-1 and into the Russian segment, visiting the FGB, a docked Soyuz spacecraft, Docking Compartment, Service Module and two Progress spacecraft.]]

The assembly of the International Space Station, a major endeavour in [[space architecture]], began in November 1998.<ref name="OnOrbit">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf|title=On-Orbit Elements|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=28 November 2009|format=PDF}}</ref> Astronauts install each element using spacewalks.  By 27 November 2009, they had completed 136, totalling 849&nbsp;hours of [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA), all devoted to assembly and maintenance of the station. Twenty-eight of these spacewalks originated from the airlocks of docked Space Shuttles; the remaining 108 were launched from the station.<ref name="ISStD"/>

The first segment of the ISS, ''Zarya'', was launched on 20 November 1998 on a Russian [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]], followed two weeks later by [[Unity (ISS module)|''Unity'']]&mdash;the first of three node modules&mdash;which was launched aboard Space Shuttle flight [[STS-88]]. This bare two-module core of the ISS remained unmanned for the next one-and-a-half years. In July 2000 the Russian module ''Zvezda'' was added, allowing a maximum crew of three to occupy the ISS continuously. The first resident crew, [[Expedition 1]], arrived in November 2000 on [[Soyuz TM-31]], midway between the flights of [[STS-92]] and [[STS-97]]. These two Space Shuttle flights each added segments of the station's [[Integrated Truss Structure]], which provided the embryonic station with communications, guidance, electrical grounding (on Z1), and power via [[solar array]]s located on the P6 truss.<ref name="ESA sequence"/>

Over the next two years the station continued to expand. A [[Soyuz-U]] rocket delivered the [[Pirs docking compartment|''Pirs'' docking compartment]]. The Space Shuttles ''Discovery'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''Endeavour'' delivered the [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'' laboratory]] and [[Quest Joint Airlock|''Quest'' airlock]], in addition to the station's main robot arm, the ''[[Canadarm2]]'', and several more segments of the Integrated Truss Structure.<ref name="ESA sequence"/>

The expansion schedule was interrupted by the destruction of the {{OV|102}} on [[STS-107]] in 2003, with the resulting hiatus in the [[Space Shuttle program]]me halting station assembly until the launch of ''Discovery'' on [[STS-114]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2005/07/discovery-launches-the-shuttle-is-back/

The official resumption of assembly was marked by the arrival of ''Atlantis'', flying [[STS-115]], which delivered the station's second set of solar arrays. Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on [[STS-116]], [[STS-117]], and [[STS-118]]. As a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities, more pressurised modules could be accommodated, and the [[Harmony (ISS module)|''Harmony'']] node and ''Columbus'' European laboratory were added. These were followed shortly after by the first two components of ''Kib<U+014D>'', the [[Japanese Experiment Module]]. In March 2009, [[STS-119]] completed the Integrated Truss Structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays.  The final section of ''Kib<U+014D>'' was delivered by ''Endeavour'' in July 2009 on [[STS-127]].<ref name="ESA sequence"/>

{{As of|2009|12}}, the station consisted of eleven pressurised modules and the complete Integrated Truss Structure. Still to be launched is the third and final American node, [[Tranquility (ISS module)|''Tranquillity'']], a [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module|Permanent Logistics Module]], the [[European Robotic Arm]], two Russian modules and the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS). Assembly is expected to be completed by 2011, by which point the station will have a mass in excess of 400&nbsp;[[metric ton]]s (440&nbsp;[[short ton]]s).<ref name="OnOrbit"/><ref name="Manifest"/>

===Pressurised modules===
When completed, the ISS will consist of sixteen pressurised modules with a combined volume of around {{m3 to ft3|1000|abbr=yes}}. These modules include laboratories, docking compartments, airlocks, nodes and living quarters. Eleven of these components are already in orbit, with the remaining five awaiting launch. Each module was or will be launched either by the Space Shuttle, Proton rocket or [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]].<ref name="ESA sequence">{{cite web|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/esa_iss_assembly_sequence/index_pop.html|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=6 March 2009|title=HSF: ISS assembly sequence and on-orbit configuration}}</ref>

In addition to the pressurised modules, the ISS features a large number of external components. The largest component is the Integrated Truss Structure (ITS), to which the station's main solar arrays and thermal radiators are mounted.<ref name="Arrays"/> The ITS consists of ten separate segments forming a structure 108.5&nbsp;m (356&nbsp;ft) long.<ref name="OnOrbit"/>

The [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS), a particle physics experiment, is scheduled to be launched on [[STS-134]] in 2010, and will be mounted externally on the ITS. The AMS will measure [[cosmic ray]]s and look for evidence of [[dark matter]] and [[antimatter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ams.cern.ch/|title=The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Experiment|publisher=[[CERN]]|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>

The ITS serves as a base for the main remote manipulator system called the Mobile Servicing System (MSS). This consists of the Mobile Base System (MBS), the [[Canadarm2]], and the [[Dextre|Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator]].

The station in its complete form will have several smaller external components, such as the three [[External Stowage Platform]]s (ESPs), launched on [[STS-102]], [[STS-114]] and [[STS-118]], which are used for storage of spare parts. Four [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) will allow experiments to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space, and will provide the necessary electricity and computing to process experimental data locally.

===Power supply===
{{Main|Electrical system of the International Space Station}}
[[Image:ISS on 20 August 2001.jpg|thumb|alt=The ISS shown orbiting the Earth, with the blackness of space behind. In view are one of the large orange solar array wings at the top, a cluster of pressurised modules below, and four smaller, blue solar arrays projecting from the modules.|The ISS in 2001, showing the solar arrays on ''Zarya'' and ''Zvezda'', in addition to the US P6 solar arrays]]

The source of [[Electric power|electrical power]] for the ISS is the sun. Sunlight is converted into electricity by solar arrays. The Russian segment of the station uses 28&nbsp;[[volt]]s [[direct current|DC]] (partly provided by four solar arrays mounted directly to ''Zarya'' and ''Zvezda''), as does the space shuttle, but in the remainder of the station, electricity provided by the US solar arrays is distributed at a voltage ranging from 130 to 180 volts DC. These arrays are arranged as four pairs of wings, and each pair is capable of generating nearly 32.8 [[watt|kW]] of DC power.<ref name="Arrays"/>

Power is stabilised and distributed at 160&nbsp;volts DC, and then is converted to the user-required 124&nbsp;volts DC. The [[High voltage|high-voltage]] distribution allows the use of small-diameter electrical cables and consequently reduces weight. Power can be shared between the two segments of the station using converters. The power sharing feature has become essential since the cancellation of the Russian [[Science Power Platform]] because the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] now depends on the US-built solar arrays for power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/solar_arrays.html|date=2 November 2006|title=Boeing: Integrated Defense Systems<U+2014>NASA Systems<U+2014>International Space Station<U+2014>Solar Power|accessdate=28 January 2009|publisher=Boeing}}</ref>

Since the station is often not in direct sunlight, it relies on rechargeable [[Nickel hydrogen battery|nickel-hydrogen batteries]] to provide continuous power for the 35 minutes of every 90 minute orbit during which it is eclipsed by the Earth. During the sunlit part of the orbit, the batteries are recharged. The batteries have a working life of 6.5 years, and they are expected to be replaced multiple times during the anticipated 20-year life of the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1999/5000/5420miller.html|title=Nickel-Hydrogen Battery Cell Life Test Program Update for the International Space Station|accessdate=27 November 2009|publisher=NASA|author=Thomas B. Miller|date=24 April 2000}}</ref>

The US solar arrays normally track the sun to maximise power generation. Each array is about 375&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (450 yd<sup>2</sup>) in area and {{convert|58|m|yd|0}} long. In the complete configuration, the solar arrays track the sun in each orbit by rotating the ''alpha [[gimbal]]'', while the ''beta gimbal'' adjusts for the angle of the sun from the orbital plane. Another tracking option, the [[Night Glider mode]], which aligns the solar arrays edgewise to the direction of travel when the panels are in the Earth's shadow, is used to reduce the effects of the drag produced by the tenuous upper atmosphere, through which the station flies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=G.

The ISS is maintained at an orbit with a minimum altitude of 278&nbsp;km (173&nbsp;mi) and a maximum of 460&nbsp;km (286&nbsp;mi).  It travels at an average speed of 27,724&nbsp;kilometres (17,227&nbsp;mi) per hour, and completes 15.7&nbsp;orbits per day.<ref name="tracking">{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/index.html|title=Current ISS Tracking data|accessdate=28 January 2009|publisher=NASA|date=15 December 2008|author=NASA}}</ref> The normal maximum altitude is 425&nbsp;km (264&nbsp;mi) to allow Soyuz rendezvous missions.

The station's navigational position is established using the US [[Global Positioning System]] and Russian [[GLONASS]] system, with the [[Yaw, pitch and roll#Aircraft attitude|attitude]] (orientation) of the station monitored by a set of [[Attitude dynamics and control#Absolute attitude sensors|sun, star and horizon sensors]] on ''Zvezda''.<ref name="ISSRG"/> Attitude is maintained by either of two mechanisms; normally, a system using several [[control moment gyroscope]]s (CMGs) keeps the station oriented, with ''Destiny'' forward of ''Unity'', the P truss on the port side, and ''Pirs'' on the earth-facing (nadir) side. When the CMG system becomes 'saturated'<U+2014>when a CMG exceeds its operational range or cannot track a series of rapid movements<U+2014>it can lose its ability to control station attitude.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes|author=Carlos Roithmayr|year=2003|publisher=NASA|location=Langley Research Centre|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dynamics-Attitude-Spacecraft-Flywheels-Gyroscopes/dp/B0018V9YG6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236365448&sr=8-1}}</ref> In this event, the Russian attitude control system is designed to take over automatically, using [[monopropellant rocket|thrusters]] to maintain station attitude and allowing the CMG system to desaturate.

[[Radio|Radio communications]] provide [[telemetry]] and scientific data links between the station and [[Mission Control Center|Mission Control Centres]]. Radio links are also used during [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking procedures]] and for audio and video communication between crewmembers, flight controllers and family members.

[[Ultra high frequency|UHF radio]] is used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]. UHF is employed by other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]], [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] and the Space Shuttle (except the shuttle also makes use of the S band and Ku band systems via TDRSS), to receive commands from Mission Control and ISS crewmembers.<ref name="ISSRG"/> Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment; the ATV uses a [[laser]] attached to the spacecraft and equipment attached to ''Zvezda'', known as the Proximity Communications Equipment, to accurately dock to the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16247|title=ISS/ATV communication system flight on Soyuz|accessdate=30 November 2009|publisher=[[EADS Astrium]]|date=28 February 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|author=Chris Bergin|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/11/sts-129-support-dragon-communication-demo-iss/|date=10 November 2009|accessdate=30 November 2009|title=STS-129 ready to support Dragon communication demo with ISS}}</ref>

===Microgravity===
At the station's orbital altitude, the gravity from the Earth is 88% of that at sea level. The state of [[weightlessness]] is caused by the constant free fall of the ISS, which, because of the [[equivalence principle]], is indiscernible from a state of zero gravity.<ref name="why0g">{{cite web|url=http://www.bnsc.gov.uk/Discovering%20Space/Microgravity/8057.aspx|title=Microgravity|accessdate=7 September 2009|date=3 August 2009|format=aspx|publisher=British National Space Council}}</ref> The environment on the station is, however, often described as [[Micro-g environment|microgravity]], as the weightlessness is imperfect. This is caused by four separate effects:<ref name="gravity">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/downloads/userguides/physenv.pdf|title=European Users Guide to Low Gravity Platforms|accessdate=16 May 2006|date=6 December 2005|format=PDF|publisher=European Space Agency}}</ref>

*The drag resulting from the residual atmosphere.
*Vibratory acceleration caused by mechanical systems and the crew on board the ISS.
*Orbital corrections by the on-board gyroscopes or thrusters.
*The spatial separation from the real [[center of mass|centre of mass]] of the ISS. Any part of the ISS not at the exact centre of mass will tend to [[Gravity-gradient stabilization|follow its own orbit]]. However, as each point is physically part of the station, this is impossible, and so each component is subject to small accelerations from the forces which keep them attached to the station as it orbits.<ref name="gravity"/> This is also called the [[tidal force]].

===Life support===
[[Image:SpaceStationCycle.svg|thumb|480px|The interactions between the components of the ISS Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)|alt=A flowchart diagram showing the components of the ISS life support system. See adjacent text for details.]]

The ISS [[Environmental Control and Life Support System]] (ECLSS) provides or controls [[atmospheric pressure]], fire detection and suppression, oxygen levels, waste management and water supply. The highest priority for the ECLSS is the ISS atmosphere, but the system also collects, processes, and stores waste and water produced and used by the crew<U+2014>a process that recycles fluid from the sink, shower, toilet, and condensation from the air. The [[Elektron (ISS)|''Elektron'']] system aboard ''Zvezda'' and a similar system in ''Destiny'' generate oxygen aboard the station.<ref name="OGS">{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/060215_techwed_iss_oxygen.html|title=Air Apparent: New Oxygen Systems for the ISS|author=Tariq Malik|publisher=Space.com|date=15 February 2006|accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref> The crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and [[chemical oxygen generator|Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation]] (SFOG) canisters.<ref name="breath easy">{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast13nov_1.htm|title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station|author=Patrick L.

===Sightings===
[[Image:ISS 26.07.07.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=A streak of light in a starry sky over some houses.|A July 2007 sighting of the International Space Station]]

Because of the size of the ISS (about that of an [[American football#Field and players|American football field]]) and the large reflective area offered by its [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]], ground based [[Satellite watching|observation]] of the station is possible with the [[Naked eye#Naked eye in astronomy|naked eye]] if the observer is in the right location at the right time. In many cases, the station is one of the brightest naked-eye objects in the sky, although it is visible only for periods ranging from two to five minutes.<ref name="see">{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html|title=International Space Station Sighting Opportunities|accessdate=28 January 2009|publisher=NASA|date=2 July 2008|author=NASA}}</ref>

To view the station, the following conditions need to be fulfilled, assuming the weather is clear: The station must be above the observer's horizon, and it must pass within about {{convert|2000|km|mi}} of the observation site (the closer the better).  It must be dark enough at the observer's location for stars to be visible, and the station must be in sunlight rather than in the Earth's shadow. It is common for the third condition to begin or end during what would otherwise be a good viewing opportunity. In the evening, as the station moves further from the dusk, going from west to east it will appear to suddenly fade and disappear. In the reverse situation, it may suddenly appear in the sky as it approaches the dawn.<ref name="see"/><ref name="ESAsee">{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA0I6KE43D_iss_0.html|title=See the ISS from your home town|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=European Space Agency|date=7 January 2009|author=European Space Agency}}</ref>

The ISS is a joint project of several space agencies: the US [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RKA), the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA) and the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).<ref name="PartStates">{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration<U+2014>European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}</ref>

As a multinational project, the legal and financial aspects are complex. Issues of concern include the ownership of modules, station utilisation by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply. Obligations and rights are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the primary nations involved in the Space Station project; the United States of America, Russian Federation, Japan, Canada and ten member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland).<ref name="ESA-IGA">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&level=11&page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009}}</ref>  A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.<ref name="ESA-IGA"/> Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.<ref name="RSA-MOU">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}</ref>

The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by the Russian Federation's space agency and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station has been assigned as follows:

The research capabilities of the ISS have been criticised, particularly following the cancellation of the ambitious [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]], which, alongside other equipment cancellations, means research done on the ISS is generally limited to experiments which do not require any specialised apparatus. For example, in the first half of 2007, ISS research dealt primarily with human biological responses to living and working in space, covering topics like [[kidney stones]], [[circadian rhythm]], and the effects of [[cosmic rays]] on the [[nervous system]].<ref name="renal">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Renal-Stone.html|title=Renal Stone Risk During Spaceflight: Assessment and Countermeasure Validation (Renal Stone)|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}</ref><ref name="sleep">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/Sleep-Long.html|title=Sleep-Wake Actigraphy and Light Exposure During Spaceflight-Long (Sleep-Long)|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}</ref><ref name="CNS">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ALTEA.html|title=Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA)|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}</ref> Other criticisms hinge on the technical design of the ISS, including <!--the necessity for a high level of maintenance to be carried out by the crew, particularly via risky EVAs,<ref name="foust">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/453/1|title=The trouble with space stations|accessdate=23 March 2009|publisher=[[The Space Review]]|year=2005|author=[[Jeff Foust]]}}</ref> and--> the high inclination of the station's orbit, which leads to a higher cost for US-based launches to the station.<ref name="astrosoc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/34/space2.html|title=Up, Up, and Away|accessdate=10 September 2006|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|year=1996|author=James J.

In response to some of these comments, advocates of manned space exploration say that criticism of the ISS project is short-sighted, and that manned space research and exploration have produced billions of dollars' worth of benefits. NASA has estimated that the indirect economic return from spin-offs of [[human spaceflight|human space exploration]] has been many times the initial public investment, although this estimate is based on the Apollo programme and was made in the 1970s.<ref name="Schnee">{{Cite web|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/index.jsp?method=order&oaiID=19760016995|title=Economic impact of large public programs The NASA experience|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)|year=1976|author=E.

===End of mission and deorbit plans===
NASA currently plans to [[Satellite#End of Life|deorbit]] the ISS in the first quarter of 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/12/AR2009071201977.html|title=As Space Station Nears Completion, It Faces End of Mission|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref> However, the plan to end the ISS programme in 2015, as [[Vision for Space Exploration|determined in 2004]] by then-President [[George W.

NASA has the responsibility to deorbit the ISS. Although ''Zvezda'' has a propulsion system used for station-keeping, it is not powerful enough for a controlled deorbit. Options for controlled deorbit of the ISS include the use of a modified European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] or a specially constructed deorbit vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/07/03/215291/nasa-may-buy-esas-atv-to-de-orbit-iss-at-end-of-life.html|accessdate=27 September 2009|title=NASA may buy ESA's ATV to de-orbit ISS at end of life|publisher=Flightglobal|author=Rob Coppinger|date=7 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://search.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9794&page=28|isbn=0-309-06938-6|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2000|pages=28<U+2013>30|author=Thomas Kelly, ''et al''.|title=Engineering Challenges to the Long-Term Operation of the International Space Station}}</ref>

According to a 2009 report, [[RKK Energia]] is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the Russian Orbital Segment when the end of mission is reached and use them as a basis for a new station, known as the [[Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex]]. The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS include the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]] (MLM), currently scheduled to be launched at the end of 2011, with other Russian modules which are currently planned to be attached to the MLM until 2015, although still currently unfunded. Neither the MLM nor any additional modules attached to it would have reached the end of their useful lives in 2016 or 2020. The report presents a statement from an unnamed Russian engineer who believes that, based on the experience from ''[[Mir]]'', a thirty year life should be possible, except for micrometeorite damage, because the Russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8064060.stm|title=Russia 'to save its ISS modules'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}</ref>

==Life on board==
===Crew schedule===
The time zone used on board the ISS is [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC, sometimes informally called [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]). The windows are covered at night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets a day. During visiting space shuttle missions, the ISS crew will mostly follow the shuttle's [[Mission Elapsed Time]] (MET), which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the shuttle mission.<ref name="MET">{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/Realtime/Rocket_Sci/clocks/time-met.html|title=Mission Elapsed Time explained|accessdate=9 November 2007|date=13 September 1995|publisher=NASA}}</ref><ref name="STS-113-interview">{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/crew/sts-113/index_2.html|title=Ask the STS-113 crew: Question 14|accessdate=9 November 2007|date=7 December 2002|publisher=NASA}}</ref> Because the sleeping periods between the UTC time zone and the MET usually differ, the ISS crew often has to adjust its sleeping pattern before the space shuttle arrives and after it leaves to shift from one time zone to the other in a practice known as sleep shifting.<ref name="STS-113-question-and-answer">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/webcasts/shuttle/sts113/mission-crew-qa.html|title=STS-113 Mission and Expedition Crew Question and Answer Board|accessdate=24 February 2009|date=November 2002|publisher=NASA}}</ref>

A typical day for the crew begins with a wake-up at 06:00, followed by post-sleep activities and a morning inspection of the station. The crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with Mission Control before starting work at around 08:10. The first scheduled exercise of the day follows, after which the crew continues work until 13:05. Following a one-hour lunch break, the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 19:30, including dinner and a crew conference. The scheduled sleep period begins at 21:30. In general, the crew works 10 hours per day on a weekday, and 5 hours on Saturdays, with the rest of the time  their own for relaxation, games or work catch-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/287386main_110508_tl.pdf|title=ISS Crew Timeline|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=5 November 2008|publisher=NASA|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Sleeping in space===
[[Image:Temporary Sleep Station.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An astronaut emerges from a small sleeping compartment surrounded by equipment.|Astronaut [[Peggy Whitson]] in the doorway of a sleeping rack in the ''Destiny'' laboratory]]
The station provides crew quarters for each member of permanent Expedition crews, with two 'sleep stations' in the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] and four more, due to be installed in ''Tranquillity'', currently spread around the [[US Orbital Segment]]. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. A crewmember can sleep in them in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal effects in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop.<ref name="NASACrewEquip">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/126_payload.html|title=Station Prepares for Expanding Crew|publisher=NASA|author=Cheryl L.

Otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.<ref name="ESALife"/>

===Hygiene===
Since the removal of the [[Habitation module]] from the station's design, the ISS has not featured a shower. Instead, crewmembers wash using a water jet and wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container. Crews are also provided with rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.<ref name="SRLife"/>

There are two [[space toilet]]s on the ISS, both of Russian design, located in [[Zvezda (ISS)|''Zvezda'']] and [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'']].<ref name="NASACrewEquip"/> These Waste and Hygiene Compartments use a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System. Astronauts first fasten themselves to the toilet seat, which is equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal.<ref name="ESALife"/> A lever operates a powerful fan and a suction hole slides open: the air stream carries the waste away.

Waste is collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it is recycled back into drinking water.<ref name="CSALife"/>

===Food & drink===
[[Image:Meal STS127.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Thirteen astronauts seated around a table covered in open cans of food strapped down to the table. In the background a selection of equipment is visible, as well as the salmon-coloured walls of the Unity node.|The crews of [[STS-127]] and [[Expedition 20]] enjoy a meal inside ''Unity''.]]
Most of the food eaten by station crews is frozen, refrigerated or canned. Menus are prepared by the astronauts, with the help of a [[dietitian]], before the astronauts' flight to the station.<ref name="CSALife"/> As the sense of taste is reduced in orbit because of fluid shifting to the head, spicy food is a favourite of many crews.<ref name="ESALife"/> Each crewmember has individual food packages and cooks them using the onboard galley, which features two food warmers, a refrigerator, and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water.<ref name="NASACrewEquip"/> Drinks are provided in dehydrated powder form, and are mixed with water before consumption.<ref name="NASACrewEquip"/><ref name="CSALife"/> Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws, while solid food is eaten with a knife and fork, which are attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them floating away. Any food which does float away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it clogging up the station's air filters and other equipment.<ref name="CSALife"/>

===Exercise===

The most significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness are [[muscle atrophy]] and deterioration of the [[skeleton]], or [[spaceflight osteopenia]]. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the [[cardiovascular system]], decreased production of [[red blood cell]]s, balance disorders, and a weakening of the [[immune system]]. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess [[flatulence]], and puffiness of the face.  These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.<ref name="JCB"/>

To prevent some of these adverse physiological effects, the station is equipped with two [[treadmill]]s (including the [[Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System|COLBERT]]) and a [[stationary bicycle]]; each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment.<ref name="NASACrewEquip"/><ref name="ESALife"/> Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/bungee_running.html|accessdate=23 August 2009|title=Bungee Cords Keep Astronauts Grounded While Running|date=16 June 2009|name=Andrea Foster|publisher=NASA}}</ref> Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs when humans live for a long time without gravity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/colbert_feature.html|accessdate=Augist 23, 2009|title=Do Tread on Me|date=19 August 2009|name=Amiko Kauderer|publisher=NASA}}</ref>

==Station operations==
===Expeditions===
{{See also|List of International Space Station Expeditions}}
Each permanent station crew is given a sequential expedition number. Expeditions have an average duration of half a year, and they commence following the official handover of the station from one Expedition commander to another. Expeditions 1 through 6 consisted of three person crews, but the ''Columbia'' accident led to a reduction to two crew members for Expeditions 7 to 12. [[Expedition 13]] saw the restoration of the station crew to three, and the station has been permanently staffed as such since. While only three crew members are permanently on the station, several expeditions, such as [[Expedition 16]], have consisted of up to six  astronauts or cosmonauts, who are flown  to and  from the station on separate flights.<ref name="ISSEx">{{cite web|title=International Space Station Expeditions|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html|date=10 April 2009|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref><ref name="current">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html|title=International Space Station|accessdate=22 October 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA}}</ref>

On 27 May 2009, [[Expedition 20]] began.  Expedition 20 was the first ISS crew of six.  Before the expansion of the living volume and capabilities from [[STS-115]] the station could only host a crew of three. Expedition 20's crew was lifted to the station in two separate [[Soyuz-TMA]] flights launched at two different times (each Soyuz-TMA can hold only three people): [[Soyuz TMA-14]] on 26 March 2009 and [[Soyuz TMA-15]] on 27 May 2009. However, the station would not be permanently occupied by six crew members all year. For example, when the Expedition 20 crew ([[Roman Romanenko]], [[Frank De Winne]] and [[Robert Thirsk|Bob Thirsk]]) returned to Earth in November 2009, for a period of about two weeks only two crew members ([[Jeffrey Williams (astronaut)|Jeff Williams]] and [[Maksim Surayev|Max Surayev]]) were aboard. This increased to five in early December, when another Soyuz, carrying [[Oleg Kotov]], [[Timothy Creamer]] and [[Soichi Noguchi]] arrived. It will then decrease to three when Williams and Surayev depart in March 2010, returning to six in April 2010 with the launch of the next three-person Soyuz.<ref name="ISSEx"/><ref name="current"/>

The International Space Station is the [[Space station#List of occupied space stations, with statistics|most-visited spacecraft]] in the history of space flight. {{As of|2009|11|24}}, it had had 266 visitors (185 different people).<ref name="10th"/> ''[[Mir]]'' had 137 visitors (104 people).<ref name="SSSM"/>

Spacecraft from four different space agencies visit the ISS, serving a variety of purposes. The [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] from the European Space Agency, the Russian Roskosmos Progress spacecraft and the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency have provided resupply services to the station. In addition, Russia supplies a Soyuz spacecraft used for crew rotation and emergency evacuation, which is replaced every six months. Finally, the US services the ISS through its [[Space Shuttle program]]me, providing resupply missions, assembly and logistics flights, and crew rotation. {{As of|2009|11|27}}, there have been 20 Soyuz, 35 Progress, 1 ATV, 1 HTV and 31 Space Shuttle flights to the station.<ref name="ISStD">{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/isstodate.html|title=The ISS to Date|accessdate=28 November 2009|publisher=NASA|date=27 November 2009|author=NASA}}</ref> Expeditions require, on average, 2,722&nbsp;kg of supplies, and {{As of|2009|11|27|lc=yes}}, crews had consumed a total of around 19,000 meals.<ref name="ISStD"/> Soyuz crew rotation flights and Progress resupply flights visit the station on average two and three times respectively each year,<ref name="Livelist">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/resupply/index.html|title=Live listing of spacecraft operations|publisher=NASA|date=1 December 2009|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> with the ATV and HTV planned to visit annually from 2010 onwards.

====Orbital debris====

At the low altitudes at which the ISS orbits there is a variety of [[space debris]], consisting of everything from entire spent [[rocket stage]]s and defunct [[satellite]]s, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by [[RORSAT]] nuclear powered satellites, [[Project West Ford|small needles]], and many other objects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/2009/04/03/its-getting-crowded-up-there/#more-155|publisher=Defense News|accessdate=7 October 2009|author=Michael Hoffman|title=National Space Symposium 2009:It's getting crowded up there|date=3 April 2009}}</ref> These objects, in addition to natural [[micrometeoroid]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|author=F.

Space debris objects are tracked remotely from the ground, and the station crew can be notified of any objects with sufficient size to cause damage on impact. This allows for a [[Debris Avoidance Manoeuvre]] (DAM) to be conducted, which uses thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment to alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. DAMs are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance.<ref name="NSFSafeHaven"/> If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their [[Soyuz spacecraft]], so that they would be able to evacuate in the event it was damaged by the debris. This partial station evacuation has occurred twice, on 6 April 2003 and 13 March 2009.<ref name="NSFSafeHaven"/>

====Radiation====
Without the protection of the Earth's atmosphere, astronauts are exposed to higher levels of [[radiation]] from a steady flux of [[cosmic ray]]s. The station's crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] of radiation each day, which is about the same as someone would get from natural sources on Earth in a year.<ref name="Radiation">{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2956-space-station-radiation-shields-disappointing.html|title=Space station radiation shields 'disappointing'|date=23 October 2002|accessdate=7 October 2009|publisher=New Scientist|author=Eugenie Samuel}}</ref> This results in a higher risk of astronauts developing cancer. High levels of radiation can cause  damage to the [[chromosomal|chromosomes]] of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]] and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Over time lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataracts]] in astronauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.<ref name="JCB"/>

Despite efforts to improve radiation shielding on the ISS compared to previous stations such as ''[[Mir]]'', radiation levels within the station have not been vastly reduced, and it is thought that further technological advancement will be required to make long-duration human spaceflight further into the Solar System a possibility.<ref name="Radiation"/>
