The '''Great Auk''', ''Pinguinus impennis'', formerly of the [[genus]] ''[[Razorbill|Alca]]'', was a large, flightless [[alcid]] that became [[Extinction|extinct]] in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.  It was the only [[species]] in the genus '''''Pinguinus''''', a group of [[bird]]s that included several flightless giant [[auks]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] region, to survive until modern times. It bred on rocky, isolated islands with easy access to both the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that only provided a few breeding sites for the auks. When not breeding, the auks spent  their time foraging in the waters of the [[North Atlantic]], ranging as far south as [[New England]] through [[Canada]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Ireland]], and [[Great Britain]].

The Great Auk was {{convert|75|to|85|cm|in}} tall and weighed around {{convert|5|kg|lb}}, making it the largest member of the alcid family. It had a black back and a white belly. The black [[beak]] was heavy and hooked with grooves etched into its surface. During the breeding season, the Great Auk had a white patch over each eye. After the breeding season, the auk lost this patch, instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were {{convert|15|cm|in}} long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it utilized in hunting. Its favorite prey were fish, including [[Atlantic menhaden]] and [[capelin]], and [[crustaceans]]. Despite its agility in the water, it was clumsy on land. Its main predators were [[orca]], [[White-tailed Eagle]]s, [[polar bear]]s, and [[human]]s. Great Auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown streaking. Both parents incubated for about six weeks before their young hatched. The young auks left the nest site after two or three weeks and the parents continued to care for them.

Humans had preyed upon the Great Auk for more than 100,000 years. It was an important part of many Native American cultures which coexisted with the bird, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many [[Maritime Archaic]] people were buried with Great Auk bones, including one with a cloak made of over 200 auk skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the auk as a convenient food source or as bait, reducing their numbers. The bird's down came in high demand in Europe, a demand which largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-1500s. Scientists soon began to realize that the Great Auk was disapearing and it became the benefactor of many early environmental laws. However, this did not prove to be enough. Additionally, its growing rarity increased interest in European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. This trend eliminated the last of the Great Auks on 3 July 1844 on [[Geirfuglasker]], Iceland. However, a record of a bird in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of this species. The Great Auk is mentioned in a number of novels, while the scientific journal of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] is named ''[[The Auk]]'' in honor of this bird.

The Great Auk was one of the 4400 animal species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in his 18<sup>th</sup> century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', in which it was named ''Alca impennis''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

Analysis of [[mtDNA]] [[DNA sequence|sequences]] have confirmed [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] studies in regarding the [[Razorbill]] as the Great Auk's closest living relative.<ref name="Moum">{{cite journal  | last = Moum  | first = Truls| coauthors = Arnason, Ulfur & <U+00C1>rnason, Einar  | title = Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Evolution and Phylogeny of the Atlantic Alcidae, Including the Extinct Great Auk (''Pinguinus impennis'')  | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution  | volume = 19  | issue = 9  | pages = 1434<U+2013>1439  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | location = Oxford  | year = 2002| url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/9/1434.pdf| accessdate = 2009-05-08  | pmid = 12200471}}</ref> The Great Auk was also closely related to the [[Little Auk]] (Dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to ''Pinguinus''. Due to its outward similarity to the Razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the Great Auk was often placed in the genus ''Alca'', including by Linnaeus. The name ''Alca'' is a Latin derivative of the Scandinavian word for Razorbills and their relatives.  

However, the fossil record (especially ''Pinguinus alfrednewtoni'' from the Early [[Pliocene]] [[Yorktown Formation]] of the Lee Creek Mine, United States) and molecular evidence demonstrate that the three genera, while still closely related, diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout [[Xantus's Murrelet]], had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. By that time the murres, or Atlantic [[guillemot]]s, had apparently already split off from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the [[Pliocene]], but the evolution of the Little Auk is sparsely documented.<ref name="Moum"/> The molecular data are compatible with either view, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the Great Auk in a distinct genus.<ref name="Moum"/> The Great Auk was not closely related to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, ''[[Mancalla]]'', ''[[Praemancalla]]'', and ''[[Alcodes]]''.<ref name="BNASystematics"/>

The [[Basque language|Basque]] name for the Great Auk is ''arponaz'' while the early [[French language|French]] name was ''apponatz'', both meaning "spearbill". The [[Norsemen|Norse]] called the Great Auk ''geirfugl'', which means "spearbird". This has led to an alternative common name for the bird, "garefowl".<ref name="Cokinos333">Cokinos 2000, p. 333</ref> [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors called the bird ''ping<U+00FC>inos'', which means "fat bird". The [[Inuit]] name for the Great Auk was ''isarukitsck'', which meant "little wing".<ref name="Cokinos314"/> The [[Welsh people]] referred to this species as "pingwen".<ref name="Crofford8">Crofford 1989, p. 8</ref> When European explorers discovered what are today known as [[penguin]]s in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their [[convergent evolution|similar appearance]] to the Great Auk and named them after this bird, despite the fact that they are not related.<ref name="Crofford10">Crofford 1989, p. 10</ref>

==Relationship with humans==
The Great Auk is known to have been preyed upon by [[Neanderthal]]s more than 100,000 years ago, as evidenced by well-cleaned bones being found by their campfires.<ref name="Crofford5"/> Images of the Great Auk were also carved into the walls of the [[El Pinto Cave]] in Spain over 35,000 years ago,<ref name="Crofford6">Crofford 1989, p. 6</ref> while cave paintings 20,000 years old have been found in France's [[Grotte Cosquer]].<ref name="Cokinos314">Cokinos 2000, p. 314</ref>

Native Americans who coexisted with the Great Auk valued it as a food source during the winter and as an important symbol. Images of the Great Auk have been found in bone necklaces.<ref name="Crofford36">Crofford 1989, p. 36</ref> A person buried at the [[Maritime Archaic]] site at [[Port au Choix]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], dating to about 2000 BC, seems to have been interred clothed in a suit made from more than 200 Great Auk skins, with the heads left attached as decoration.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Tuck  | first = James A.  | title = Ancient peoples of Port au Choix: The Excavation of an Archaic Indian Cemetery in Newfoundland  | journal = Newfoundland Social and Economic Studies  | volume = 17| publisher = Institute of Social and Economic Research, Memorial U of Newfoundland  | location = St. John<U+2019>s  | year = 1976}}</ref> Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the Great Auk, suggesting that it had cultural significance for the Maritime Archaic people.<ref name="BNAConservation"/> The extinct [[Beothuk]]s of Newfoundland made pudding out of the auk's eggs.<ref name="Cokinos313"/> The [[Dorset Eskimo]]s also hunted the species, while the [[Saqqaq]] in Greenland overhunted the species, causing a range reduction locally.<ref name="BNAConservation"/>

Later, European sailors utilized the auks as a navigational beacon, as it was known that the presence of these birds signaled that the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] were near.<ref name="Cokinos314"/>

This species is estimated to have had a maximum population in the millions, although some scientists dispute this estimation.<ref name="Cokinos313"/> The Great Auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its [[down feather]]s from at least the 8<sup>th</sup> century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives can be documented from Late Stone Age [[Scandinavia]] and eastern North America,<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenway|first=James C.|title=Extinct and Vanishing Birds of the World, 2nd Edition|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|year=1967|pages=271<U+2013>291|isbn=978-0486218694 }}</ref> as well as from early 5<sup>th</sup> century [[Labrador]] where the bird seems to have occurred only as a straggler.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Richard H|coauthors=Storrs L.

The [[Little Ice Age]] may have reduced the population of the Great Auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by [[polar bear]]s, but massive exploitation for their down drastically reduced the population.<ref name="BNADemography"/> By the mid-1500s, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows.<ref name="Crofford40">Crofford 1989, p. 40</ref> In 1553, the auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 London banned the killing of this species for its feathers.<ref name="Cokinos330">Cokinos 2000, p. 330</ref> In [[St. John's]], individuals violating a 1775 law banning hunting the Great Auk for its feathers or eggs were publically flogged, though hunting for use as bait was still permitted.<ref name="BNAConservation"/> On the North American side, [[eider]] down was initially preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the auk at the same time that hunting for food, bait, and oil decreased.<ref name="BNAConservation"/><ref name="Cokinos329">Cokinos 2000, p. 329</ref> Specimens of the Great Auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, and the loss of a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites of the Great Auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected eggs without embryos growing inside of them and typically discarded the eggs with embryos.<ref name="Crofford35"/>

It was on the islet of [[Stac an Armin]], [[St Kilda, Scotland]], in July 1840, that the last Great Auk seen in the British Isles was caught and killed.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Rackwitz  | first = Martin| title = Travels to Terra Incognita: The Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in Early Modern Travellers' Accounts C. 1600 to 1800  | publisher = Waxmann Verlag  | year = 2007  | location =   | page = 347| isbn = 9783830916994}}</ref> A then 75-year-old inhabitant of St Kilda told Henry Evans, a frequent visitor to the archipelago, that he and his father-in-law with another man had caught a "garefowl", noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head.

The last colony of Great Auks lived on [[Geirfuglasker]] (the "Great Auk Rock") off Iceland. This islet was a volcanic rock surrounded by cliffs which made it inaccessible to humans, but in 1830 the islet submerged, and the birds moved to the nearby island of [[Eldey]], which was accessible from a single side. When the colony was initially discovered in 1835, nearly fifty birds were present. Museums, desiring the skins of the auk for preservation and display, quickly began collecting birds from the colony.<ref name="Crofford43">Crofford 1989, p. 43</ref> The last pair, found incubating an egg, was killed there on 3 July 1844, with J<U+00F3>n Brandsson and Sigur<U+00F0>ur <U+00CD>sleifsson strangling the adults and Ketill Ketilsson smashing the egg with his boot.<ref name="EllisNTB">{{cite book| last = Ellis| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Ellis (biologist) | title = No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species| publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2004| location = New York| pages = 160| isbn =0-06-055804-0 }}</ref> However, a later claim of a live individual sighted in 1852 on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] has been accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ([[IUCN]]).<ref name = "BLI 2004">{{IUCN2006|assessors=BirdLife International|year=2004|id=40658|title=Pinguinus impennis|downloaded=11 May 2006}}</ref>

Today, around 75 eggs of the Great Auk remain in museum collections, along with 24 complete skeletons and 81 mounted skins.  While thousands of isolated bones have been collected from 19<sup>th</sup> century [[Funk Island]] to [[Neolithic]] [[midden]]s, only a small number of complete skeletons exist.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luther|first=Dieter|title=Die ausgestorbenen V<U+00F6>gel der Welt, 4th edition (Die neue Brehm-B<U+00FC>cherei '''424''')|publisher=Westarp-Wissenschaften|location=Spektrum, Heidelberg|year=1996|pages=78<U+2013>84|isbn=3-89432-213-6|language=German}}</ref> Following the bird's extinction, the price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year.<ref name="Cokinos331"/>

The Great Auk is one of the more frequently-referenced extinct birds in literature. It appears in many works of children's literature, including [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'' and [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''[[The Island of Adventure]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kingsley|first=Charles|title=The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1995|isbn=0-19-282238-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Blyton|first=Enid|title=The Island of Adventure|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1944}}</ref> Both works deal with the bird's extinction, with the first novel depicting an auk telling the tale of its species extinction and the latter novel sending the protagonist on a failed search for what he believes is a lost colony of the species. The Great Auk is also present in a wide variety of other works of fiction. In his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[James Joyce]] mentions the bird while the novel's main character is drifting into sleep. He associates the Great Auk with the mythical [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] bird as a method of formally returning the main character to a sleepy land of fantasy and memory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=James|title=Ulysses|publisher=BiblioLife |location=Charleston, SC|year=2007|pages=682|isbn=978-1-4346-0387-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dq2CgT4tIlsC&dq=Ulysses&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=5t3ZS4HhD4G88gaSgI2MAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> ''[[Penguin Island (novel)|Penguin Island]]'', a 1908 French satirical novel by the [[Nobel Prize]] winning author [[Anatole France]], narrates the fictional [[history]] of a Great Auk population that is mistakenly baptized by a [[Myopia|nearsighted]] [[missionary]].<ref>{{cite book|last=France|first=Anatole|title=Penguin Island|publisher=Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1930/1930-h/1930-h.htm|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> A Great Auk is collected by fictional naturalist [[Stephen Maturin]] in the [[Patrick O'Brian]] historical novel ''[[The Surgeon's Mate]]''.
