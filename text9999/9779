On [[29 April]] [[2008]], McCall announced the list of players he would be keeping and releasing at the end of the season. As well as Ricketts, who was unlikely to be given a new work permit, the first team players to be released were Darren Williams, Paul Evans, Tom Penford and Alex Rhodes. Craig Bentham, who had spent three months on loan at Farsley Celtic, and Scott Phelan, who had not featured since December, were also deemed surplus to requirements. Back-up goalkeepers Ben Saynor and Jamie Waite, neither of whom had played a first team league game, and youngsters David Brown, Luke Morgan and Damian Hopkins completed the list of 13&nbsp;players to leave the club. Barry Conlon and Kyle Nix were the only first team regulars to be offered new contracts, along with juniors Luke Medley, Luke O'Brien and Sean Taylforth.<ref name="released">{{cite news

City finished the season with a 2&ndash;1 defeat at [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], when Luke Medley scored a penalty on his first start for the club. McCall had made a number of changes to the side, after his decision to release 13&nbsp;players, giving a debut to [[Sean Taylforth]] and also giving places to three of the released players. It was also David Wetherall's final game for the club.<ref>{{cite news
