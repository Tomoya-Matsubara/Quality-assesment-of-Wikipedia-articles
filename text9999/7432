===Original peristyle===
In 1917, the original peristyle was designed by renowned Chicago planner [[Edward H. Bennett]], who was [[Daniel Burnham]]'s partner in the [[Plan of Chicago]] and who was known for designing the nearby [[Buckingham Fountain]]. It was located in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in the same location as the current Wrigley Square.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/parkhistory/|title=Park History|accessdate=2008-06-20|publisher=City of Chicago}}</ref> The original peristyle rose to {{convert|40|ft|m|1|lk=on}} and had a [[diameter]] of {{convert|100|ft|m|1|lk=on}}.<ref name=MPIMMPaWSS/> The original was made of [[concrete]], which did not stand up to the [[Lake Michigan]] lakefront weather.<ref name=plaque/> In 1953 it was razed to make way for the Grant Park North Garage.<ref name=MPIMMPaWSS>{{cite web|url=http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/cplarchive/archivalcoll/mpi_mill_wrigleysquare.php|title=Millennium Park Inc. - Millennium Monument (Peristyle) and Wrigley Square Series|accessdate=2008-06-03|publisher=[[Chicago Public Library]]}}</ref> The original peristyle was on a [[promenade]] with [[baluster|balustrade]]s.<ref name=CAPC/>

===Millennium Monument===
A gift from the [[Wrigley Company|William Wrigley, Jr. Company]], the [[limestone]] replica peristyle rises to a height of nearly {{convert|40|ft|m|1}} (one source says the columns were planned to rise to {{convert|36|ft|m|1}}),<ref name=MPgloo/> restoring a classical elegance to Grant Park.

The David Dillon and Michael Patrick Sullivan (of OWP&P) design is based on original drawings by Bennett found in the [[Chicago Park District]]'s archive.<ref name=MPIMMPaWSS/>

Wrigley Company officials, including [[William Wrigley, Jr. II]], wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle was attractive to them partly because the original peristyle was constructed around the same time as the [[Wrigley Building]], the corporate headquarters located a few blocks to the north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar.<ref name=MPIMMPaWSS/>

The 24 paired, [[fluted column]]s are the same height as the original peristyle. However, the structure was scaled down to an {{convert|80|ft|m|1|adj=on}} diameter in order to accommodate the accessible ramp that runs behind the monument.<ref name=MPIMMPaWSS/> Each of the limestone columns is cut from an Indiana [[Indiana limestone|quarry]] and made of five {{convert|2200|lb|kg st|1|lk=on}} sections reinforced by steel rods and plates.<ref name=MPgloo>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F227C5F4D1917DC&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title= Millennium Park gets look of old - After 5 decades, city re-creates classical peristyle|accessdate=2008-06-06|date=[[2002-03-09]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Nevala, Amy E.}}</ref> The fountain in front of the monument is a [[bronze]]-cast replica of the [[finial]]s that adorn the Wrigley Building.<ref name=plaque/> The [[brass]] spout was made from a mold of a [[terra cotta]] finail on the Wrigley Building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brainsnack.net/cpg/displayimage.php?album=10&pos=4|title=Pictorial Chicago: Fountain in Wrigley Square, Brass Spout|accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref>

The front of the monument has a dedication plaque (pictured left). In addition, on the reverse side in approximately the same location, the monument has a special plaque commemorating [[John H. Bryan]]'s contribution as the head of fundraising for the Park.
