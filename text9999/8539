'''''Sigaus childi''''' is an endangered protected species of grasshopper from [[South Island]], [[New Zealand]] known from the [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] district. Two species of grasshoppers are listed for protection under the Wildlife Act 1953 of [[New Zealand]] this include ''S. childi'' and [[Brachaspis robustus]].<ref name=robustus_1>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278595.html#DLM278595|title=Schedule 7 Terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates declared to be animals|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office/Te Tari Tohutohu P<U+0101>remata|accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> The genus ''Sigaus'' is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[New Zealand]].

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:NZAcrididae3.JPG|thumb|left|A overview of the ''S. childi'' habitat.<br/>Galloway Station {{coord|-45.248474|169.491863|scale:60000|format=dms}}]] 
There are two isolated populations of ''S. childi'', one near the township of [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] and the other east of the township. Searches have been carried out on the northern end of the Knobby Range, North Rough Ridge, and the [[Rock and Pillar Range]]. All have failed to locate further populations of ''Sigaus childi''.<ref>Morris, S.J. ''Grasshopper Identification Sheet - Sigaus childi.'' Department of Conservation, Alexandra.</ref><ref>Morris, S.J. 2003. ''Distribution and Taxonomic status of New Zealand endangered grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae)''. Department of Conservation, Wellington.</ref> ''Sigaus childi'' is primarily found on dry, open, sparsely vegetated slopes. They are rarely found on modified farmland and are usually on north facing hillsides. Most of the ''Sigaus childi'' sites appear rocky, but this is mainly due to the low growing and sparse vegetation present there.

==Species description==
The wings on ''S. childi'' are micropterous (small wings) between {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in}} making this species flightless like most of New Zealand grasshoppers. ''Sigaus childi'' is highly [[crypsis]], there is no [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] within this species. It will match the surrounding lichens. Colours are always [[earth tones]].
Male body length {{convert|11|-|13|mm|in}}; Female body length {{convert|21|-|29|mm|in}}.
