Sea apples are [[Sea cucumbers|holothuroids]], and as such share many of the same physical characteristics. A few notable characteristics are discussed below. For more information about the physiology of holothuroids in general, see the appropriate sections in the main article [[Sea cucumbers]].

===Anatomy and feeding===
The ovate body of an adult sea apple can grow up to {{convert|7.8|in}} long.<ref name="Nilsen"/> A central mouth-like cavity is surrounded by feathery tentacles, which add additional length.<ref name="Haywood"/> Sea apples, like many [[echinoderms]], have rows of [[tube feet]] which help them move over and adhere to structures.<ref name="Haywood"/>

The bodies and tentacles of sea apples come in many different colorings. The Australian species has a primarily purple body, red feet, and purple and white tentacles.<ref name="Haywood"/>

The sea apple feeds primarily on [[plankton]], which it filters from the water with its tentacles.<ref name="Haywood"/> It alternately brings each tentacle to its mouth, scraping off the captured plankton.<ref name="Stratton"/> 

Sea apples usually feed at night at which time their delicate tentacles are less at risk from predators.<ref name="Stratton"/>

===Defense===
When disturbed, sea apples, like other holothuroids, can expel their internal organs to distract predators.<ref name="">{{cite book

In addition, if threatened or in an unsuitable environment, sea apples can consume large amounts of surrounding seawater to swell to nearly double their original size, this allows them to be moved to a new area by water currents, and much more quickly than they could walk.<ref name="Lougher">{{cite book

==Problems in captivity==
[[File:Paracucumaria tricolor 01.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Pseudocolochirus violaceus]]'']]
Because of their interesting appearance and behaviour, sea apples are often widely desired as specimen for display aquaria. They are considered [[reef safe]] as far as their compatibility with other species.<ref name="Nilsen"/> However, they can be considered unsafe for reef aquaria for multiple reasons:

=== Starvation ===
Sea apples often starve to death in display aquaria.<ref name="Haywood"/> Levels of plankton in aquaria are often lower than optimal, and sea apples are often seen attempting to feed not only at night, as in their natural habitat, but also in the daytime.<ref name="Stratton"/> With only low levels of food available, these sea apples often starve, becoming progressively smaller as this happens.<ref name="Haywood"/> To try and circumvent these problems, hobbyists attempt to give the sea apple specimens supplemental feedings of plankton and liquid food.<ref name="Stratton"/><ref name="Lougher"/>

===Harassment and predation===
Sea apples are often harassed by many aquarium inhabitants. [[Crustaceans]], such as [[hermit crabs]], and fish often pick on the sea apples feathery tentacles.<ref name="Haywood"/>
<ref name="Lougher"/> This may be for predatory purposes, or simply to steal trapped particles and plankton from the tentacles.<ref name="Lougher"/>

Occasionally, sea apples use their defense mechanisms in response to harassment. The release of their toxin can poison other aquarium inhabitants,<ref name="Nilsen"/><ref name="Lougher"/> and is one of the reasons they are not commonly seen in [[aquarium]]s.<ref>"Saltwater Invertebrates for Marine Reef Aquariums: Sea Apple."
