The '''PZL M-17 "Dudu<U+015B> Kud<U+0142>acz"''' (initially '''EM-5A''') was a [[Poland|Polish]] twin-boom pusher [[general aviation]] and trainer aircraft of [[1977]], which remained a prototype. 

==Design and development==
The aircraft was an amateur design of a team of students of [[Warsaw University of Technology]] (Politechnika Warszawska) led by [[Edward Marga<U+0144>ski]]. It had quite unorthodox layout of a [[pusher]] with twin booms and very streamlined fuselage. A crew of two sat side-by-side, and had double controls. A tricycle landing gear was retractable.

The plane was designed in 1969-1971. At the design stage it was designated '''EM-5A''' (EM for Marga<U+0144>ski) and nicknamed Dudu<U+015B> Kud<U+0142>acz (''Hairy Dudu<U+015B>''). The aircraft factory [[PZL-Mielec]] in [[Mielec]] got interested in the design and took over its development, under a designation '''PZL M-17'''. The design was modified there with help of Marga<U+0144>ski, plastic and duralumin construction was changed to riveted duralumin one, and it was given weaker engine, than designed.

The only prototype was flown on 7 July 1977 by S. Wasil. It was not produced in series. In 1979 the prototype was given to [[Rzesz<U+00F3>w University of Technology]]. A shortcoming of a streamlined fuselage was a cramped cockpit, the crewmen were half-laying in a similar way, as in [[glider]]s.  

The plane was a mid-wing monoplane. It had a two-blade wooden propeller and a fuel tank 310 l.
