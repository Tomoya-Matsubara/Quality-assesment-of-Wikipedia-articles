'''Crispin McDougal Freeman''' (born [[February 9]] [[1972]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is a prolific [[United States|American]] [[voice actor]] best known for his roles as [[Alucard (Hellsing)|Alucard]] in ''[[Hellsing (TV series)|Hellsing]]'' and the OVA ''[[Hellsing Ultimate]]'' and as Touga Kiryuu from ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]''. He also played the voice of [[Kouichi Kimura]] in ''[[Digimon: Digital Monsters]]'', Prince Turnip in Hayao Miyazaki's movie adaptation of ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'', and [[Zelgadis Greywords]] in ''[[Slayers]]''.

==Biography==
Crispin Freeman was the oldest of three children, having a younger brother, Clark, and a younger sister, Cassidy. All of which attended the [[Latin School of Chicago]], where he graduated in 1990 in a class of 60. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Williams College]], majoring in [[Theater]] and minoring in [[Computer Science]]. Afterward, he earned his [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree from [[Columbia University]] in [[Acting]], and performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] (New York City), the [[American Repertory Theater]] (Cambridge), the [[Mark Taper Forum]] (Los Angeles), Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park, and the Williamstown Theator Festival.

As a child, Freeman was greatly influenced by anime shows such as [[Speed Racer]] and [[Battle of the Planets]] ([[Gatchaman]]). [[Casey Kasem]] voiced the role of his favorite character, Mark of [[Battle of the Planets]], a.k.a., Ken the Eagle in [[Gatchaman]]. He actually wanted to change his name to Mark at one point. Later, he discovered [[Voltron]], [[Star Blazers]], and [[Robotech]], being quoted in the January 1999 issue of ''America Interview'' saying, "That show really blew me away." 

Freeman initially got involved in the anime voice-over industry when a friend of his landed a role in [[Peacock King]]. Knowing Freeman was a big anime fan, the friend suggested he call up [[Central Park Media]] and apply for a job doing english dubs. At first he didn't see why, being a fan of subtitles, rather than the english counter-parts. It wasn't until he remembered all of the anime shows he watched as a child did he realize that most people are introduced to anime through the english dubbed versions.

In 1995, Freeman landed the role of [[Zelgadis Greywords]] in [[Slayers]]. He was the fourth and final voice actor to get the job, the previous three sounding too monotone and timid for the gloomy, angst ridden character. <ref>http://amazon.ca/</ref>

Since then, Freeman has had various roles throughout his career. The most recent being Haji and Van Argeno in [[Blood+]], which airs Saturday, on [[Adult Swim]] at 12:30am, e.t. <ref>http://www.adultswim.com/</ref>

On August 11th, 2007, he married his love, Izobel Carol, on the island of Hawaii at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel. His brother Clark was best man.
