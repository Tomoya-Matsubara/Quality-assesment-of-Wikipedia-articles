'''Cinderella''' is a [[fictional character]] and is the main [[protagonist]] from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s twelth animated film [[Cinderella]] (1950) and its two [[sequels]]. In the original film she is voiced by the late [[Ilene Woods]]. The Disney version of the character was based on the French version of the tale by [[Charles Perrault]], written in 1634 in the book ''Histoires ou Contes du Temps Pass<U+00E9>.''<ref name=masterworks>{{cite web | work=Disney Archives | title=Walt's Masterworks: Cinderella|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/cinderella/index.html}}</ref> She is an official member of the [[Disney Princesses]] and is the second. She is also the leader and most well-known of them all.

==Profile==
===Physical Appearance===
Cinderella is a beautiful young woman in around her late teens with honey- blond hair as seen in the film, but her most known hair color is yellow, however. She also has light blue eyes, rosy pink lips, and small feet.

===Personality===
Cinderella is made a servant in her own home and is constantly derided by her evil stepmother Lady Tremaine and two stepsisters. Although she is shy and romantic, she maintains hope through her dreams and always waits for her prince to come. She is hopeful to the idea that someday her wishes of happiness will come true. When her evil stepsisters and stepmother prevent her from going to the ball, she is unhappy and fears that her dreams will never come true. However, her Fairy Godmother appears and restores hope. In her childhood, she hardly went to play with other children because of her dreams about the Prince. She adores the mice and birds as her friends.

Cinderella is strong-willed and determined; when the invitation to the royal ball arrives, she does everything she can to persuade her stepmother that she has every right to attend. She is presented in the film as a sympathetic heroine; well-meaning, hard-working, and positive.

In Cinderella III: A Twist in Time, her determination is put to the test as she goes through all odds to prove to her Prince that she's his true love. In this film she's seen in a very empowering role and finally learns that if you want a dream to come true, you have to help make it come true.

===Attire===
In the beginning of the film, Cinderella wears a blue [[nightdress]] and then later changes into her servant clothes which is a dark brown [[bodice]] with a brown [[skirt]], a long sleeved light aqua [[shirt]], black [[ballet flat]]s, and a white [[apron]] with a small rip on the left side of the hem. She ties her hair into a low ponytail with a blue [[hair ribbon]]. Later she wears the ball gown that her friends make. It is pink with white lace held up with light pink bows and sashes, a light pink ribbon tied at the waist also lifted to the bodice to create a bow at the neckline and short, white oval-shaped sleeves. She also has pink heels, a turquoise bead [[necklace]] and a white hair [[ribbon]] tied in a bow. When her fairy godmother turns her rags into a new ball gown, it becomes a shimmering light blue [[ball gown]] with pale blue decors, including flaps at the waistline and short, oval-shaped sleeves. As well as her gown, Cinderella wears opera-length pale blue [[glove]]s, a pale blue [[headband]], white [[earrings]]. a black velvet [[choker]], and, of course, her pale blue glass slippers with pink hearts on each one. At the end of the movie, Cinderella is shown wearing a white [[wedding gown]], a white [[tiara]] with a capped [[veil]], short white gloves, a white choker, and her glass slippers once again, at her marriage to the prince.
In the first sequel, Cinderella wears various outfits. At the beginning of Aim To Please, she wears a pink and white dress with a pink headband, white earrings, black choker, and pale pink gloves, during her arrival to Prince Charming's castle. It is the same as her signature ball gown, but slightly different. When she is one of Prudence's servants, she is forced to wear a pink ball gown trimmed with light pink lace and ribbons, along with cream long gloves and a beaded headress. When out of the pink gown and in regular clothes, Cinderella wears her servant clothes from the first film, but they are different in color. The bodice is navy blue and the skirt is blue, as the sleeves are light blue. Her hair ribbon is also a darker shade of blue. At the banquet, she is wearing a saje green and sea-green gown with a black choker with three teardrop-shaped turquoise beads nging from it, white gloves, a sea-green headband, saje earrings and ballroom shoes. Later, she is crowned by the king with a black [[tiara]] with [[aquamarines]] and [[amethysts]] encrusted into it.
In the second sequel, at the beginning of the movie, Cinderella wears a tan and cream [[peasant dress]] with brown slippers. Her original wedding gown is torn, but near the end of the movie she is dressed in a stunning, full-skirted white wedding gown trimmed with bows and ribbons with a tiara and puffy veil, white heels, necklace, and earrings, courtesy of her fairy godmother. 
==Development==
As done with other Disney films, Walt Disney hired actress Helene Stanley to perform the live-action reference for Cinderella. She later did the same kind of work for the characters of Princess Aurora in ''Sleeping Beauty'' and Anita Radcliff in ''101 Dalmatians''.

According to Christopher Finch, author of ''The Art of Walt Disney'': Disney insisted that all scenes involving human characters should be shot first in live-action to determine that they would work before the expensive business of animation was permitted to start. The animators did not like this way of working, feeling it detracted from their ability to create character. The animators understood the necessity for this approach and in retrospect acknowledged that Disney had handled things with considerable subtlety.
