'''''On the Art of the Cinema''''' ({{korean|<U+C601><U+D654><U+C608><U+C220><U+B860>{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=235}}|mr=Y<U+014F>nghwa yesul ron|context=north}}; lit. ''Film Art Theory''{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=15}}), also known as '''''The Theory of Cinematic Art''''',{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=32}} is a 1973 treatise by former [[North Korean leader]] [[Kim Jong-il]]. It is considered the most authoritative work on [[Cinema of North Korea|North Korean filmmaking]].

The book sets forth several original theories that can be applied to the practices of filmmaking, the arts, and beyond. These ideas complement the themes of nationalistic form and socialist content of films. Many ideas presented in the book are justifications for the creation of [[Propaganda in North Korea|propaganda]] supporting the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]'s policies.

''On the Art of the Cinema'' had major political implications on the succession of Kim Jong-il as the supreme leader and formation of the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]. Kim Jong-il gained political and [[Culture of North Korea|cultural]] influence in North Korean society and government by authoring the book. Actual impact on [[List of North Korean films|North Korean films]] themselves, however, are disputed.

==Background==
After his graduation in 1964, Kim Jong-il engaged in cultural, ideological and propaganda work at the [[Organization and Guidance Department of the Workers' Party of Korea|Department of Organization and Guidance]] of the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee of the party]]. Kim Jong-il intervened at the annual film conference, the [[Aesthetic Review Meeting]]. Discussion on 'foreign' film concepts was banned, and the entire conference archive was ordered to be [[Book burning|burned]].{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=13}} Since then, Kim Jong-il's influence in film and [[Literature of North Korea|literary]] administration grew, and he resisted liberal artistic influence from the [[De-Stalinization|de-Stalinizing]] Soviet Union.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=13}} From 1968, Kim Jong-il began to work on the cinematic versions of the 1930s [[Manchuria]]n guerilla plays.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=14}} Kim Jong-il had personally taken part in the production of films, such as ''[[Sea of Blood]]'', (parts one and two, 1969),{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=14}} ''[[The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man]]'' ({{korean|<U+D55C> <U+C790><U+C704><U+B2E8><U+C6D0><U+C758> <U+C6B4><U+BA85>|mr=Han chawi tanw<U+014F>n <U+016D>i unmy<U+014F>ng{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=14}}|context=north}}) (1970) and ''[[The Flower Girl]]'' (1972).{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=237}} Afterwards, Kim Jong-il began producing [[Korean revolutionary opera|revolutionary operas]]. Having obtained around a decade of experience in the state arts bureaucracy, Kim Jong-il wrote a series of essays that were published as ''On the Art of the Cinema'' on April 11, 1973. Through the rest of the 1970s, Kim Jong-il continued to oversee cultural activities.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=14}}

==Ideas==
{{quote box| align = right| width = 25em|quote=The cinema occupies an important place in the overall development of art and literature. As such it is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolution and construction. Therefore, concentrating efforts on the cinema, making breakthroughs and following up success in all areas of art and literature is the basic principle that we must adhere to in revolutionizing art and literature.|source=From the preface of ''On the Art of the Cinema''<ref name="KJI">{{Cite book|last=Kim|first=Jong-il|title=On the Art of the Cinema|date=April 11, 1973|accessdate=April 9, 2015|publisher=[[Foreign Languages Publishing House]]|url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/book/download.php?3+3010|page=2}}</ref>| salign = right}}
In the treatise, Kim Jong-il seeks to apply the principles of the North Korean ''[[Juche]]'' ideology to questions of film, literature and art in general.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=15}} According to Kim, "revolutionizing" cinema is a means of revolutionizing the whole of art and literature and exposing society to the Workers' Party's "[[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System|monolithic ideology]]" and ''Juche''.{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=235}} Building upon [[socialist realist]] literary theory and [[Kim Il-sung]]'s thought,{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=16}} Kim constructs what has been described as a "''Juche'' [[Literary realism|realism]]".{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=3}} A key aim of Kim is to employ heroic film fiction to transform man into a [[Soviet man|socialist man]]: "''Juche''-type man".{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=232}}{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=20}}

The book deals comprehensively with aspects of cinema, including [[film theory|film]] and [[literary theory]], acting, performance, score music, the screen,{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=234}} camerawork, costumes, make-up and props.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=16}} Of particular importance are themes of directing and producing as the driving forces of [[filmmaking]].{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=235}} Two major theories presented in ''On the Art of the Cinema'' are the theory of literature as "humanics" and the "seed theory". Both are considered justifications for the party's control over artistic creation.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=17}} Other ideas developed by the treatise are the so-called "modeling theory" and "speed campaign". Compliance with these principles earns an artwork the title of "collective work".<ref name="kinu_KINU">{{Cite journal| last = Lee| first=Hyang-Jin| year = 2001| title = CINEMA AND CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONHOOD IN CONTEMPORARY KOREA| publisher = [[Korea Institute for National Unification]]| journal = International Journal of Korean Unification Studies| volume = 10| issue = 1| accessdate = April 9, 2015| url = http://www.kinu.or.kr/servlet/Download?num=737&fno=776&bid=DATA03&callback=http://www.kinu.or.kr/eng/pub/pub_03_01.jsp&ses=|page=151}}</ref>

Films should be realistic, which is possible only when the filmmakers have lived with the popular masses,{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=54}} much like the ideal of the revolutionaries of the [[Korean resistance]].{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=236}} However, this "realism" entails unadulterated [[North Korea's cult of personality|worship]] for the leader and ''Juche'', making it incomparable to conventional types of realism in film, like [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=54}} Kim builds on the idea that contemporary North Korea has transcended [[class conflict]] and no real conflicts exist to be portrayed in cinema, bar historical and external ones.<ref name="Petersen2012">{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Martin  |date=January 2012 |title=The Downfall of a Model Citizen?: Family Background in North Korean Graphic Novels |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/91750863/downfall-model-citizen-family-background-north-korean-graphic-novels |journal=Korean Studies |volume=36 |issue= |pages=88<U+2013>89 |doi= |access-date=April 4, 2015|subscription=yes|quote=With conflict in art being 'the reflection of the class struggle in life,' class conflict must thus predominantly be described as a past and external phenomenon, apropos of the socialist realist theory of conflictlessness. Neglecting the mandatory depiction would be perceived as if the authors were raising an implicit critique of the North Korean state.}}</ref> This can be seen as a reassertion of the Stalinist [[Zhdanov Doctrine]]. No "negative people" who would find fault with the party's policies can exist.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=21}} Depicting conflicts within North Korean society in film could be considered being critical of the regime.<ref name="Petersen2012"/> When historical themes are depicted, and traditions should be portrayed selectively to support present ideological needs, purged of "feudal ideologies" of traditional tales and legends.{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=54}}

===Literature as humanics===
The theory of literature as "humanics" ([[McCune<U+2013>Reischauer|MR]]: {{Hangugeo|||inganhak}}) developed by Kim establishes that literature exists within the human domain.  A key theme of humanics is the question of good and worthy life, allowing for propagandist and moralistic art. The idea of ''{{ill|ko|Chajus<U+014F>ng|<U+C790><U+C8FC><U+C131> (<U+C8FC><U+CCB4><U+C0AC><U+C0C1>)}}'' ({{Language with name/for||Korean|"independent spirit"|links=no}}) is also prominent in the theory of humanics. ''Chajus<U+014F>ng'' is the metaphysical essence of humans who struggle against oppression. Philosophically, it depends on the [[indeterministic]] view on [[free will]] in ''Juche''. The [[hero]] of the story in particular embodies ''Chajus<U+014F>ng''. According to Kim, "humanics literature" gives emphasizes the development of truly independent individuals as called for by the ''Juche'' era. This brings about a transformation of the society as a whole. In [[North Korean literature]], ''Chajus<U+014F>ng'' is used as a justification of state control on literary creation{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=17}} and a nationalistic program of [[socialism in one country]].{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=18}}

===The seed theory===
The "seed theory" ({{korean|<U+C885><U+C790><U+B860>|mr=chongjaron{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=17}}|context=north}}) forms the essence of ''On the Art of the Cinema'' and, consequently, North Korean film theory in general.{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=242}}{{efn|group=nb|Although being often attributed to Kim Jong-il and ''On the Art of the Cinema'', the seed theory appears to predate the treatise.<ref name="Kim2000">{{cite book| last = Kim| first = Suk-Young|title=Illusive Utopia: Theater, Film, and Everyday Performance in North Korea|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/detail.action?docID=10395611| date = August 2000| accessdate = April 7, 2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-02689-0|page=142| quote = The practice of positioning Kim Il-sung as the disseminator of national culture was consolidated into 'seed theory' by the North Korean cultural bureau. 'Seed theory' appeared in 1972 in North Korea's ''Dictionary of Literature and Art'', which correlated the seed with Kim Il-sung's personal ideology[.]|subscription=yes}}</ref>}} It has been described as a "strange concept", a coercive method of forcing artists to follow the party line, and a means of eliminating individual creativity.{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=18}} Kim Jong-il equates a film with a living organism, noting that in this analogy the seed is its kernel. The idea is that, if all artistic interpretation is done through a single ideological foundation, or "seed", the resulting cinema is whole. This makes all members of a creative team work for a single goal, in spite of differences in personalities. The director's task is to prevent something foreign to the seed from entering cinema. The seed is the fundamental consciousness underlying artistic creativity.{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=242}}

In more concrete terms, the seed is the basis of the propaganda message of the film: "a strong, convincing idea of what to tell".{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=55}} The seed synthesizes the subject matter and the idea of a work, thus providing both the form and content.<ref name="Kim2012"/> The film should contribute to the ruling ideology{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=242}} and employ aesthetics and storytelling that support the propaganda message.{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=55}} For example, the seed of ''The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man'' could be described as "whether or not Gap Ryong participates in the revolutionary movement, he dies".{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=242}} [[Surplus value]], Kim argues, is the seed of [[Marx]]'s ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]''.<ref name="Kim2012">{{cite book|author=Sung Chull Kim|title=North Korea under Kim Jong Il: From Consolidation to Systemic Dissonance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P3u7A04Cn-MC|date=February 16, 2012|accessdate=April 7, 2015|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8093-9|page=179}}</ref>

The seed theory became influential in the literary circles of North Korea and writers sought to backtrack the seeds in classics preceding Kim's treatise.<ref name="kore_Nort">{{Cite web| title = North Korea<U+2019>s Literary Theory| author = Choi Yearn-hong| work = [[The Korea Times]]| date = April 23, 2008| accessdate = April 7, 2015| url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/09/246_22987.html}}</ref> In addition to questions of art, the seed theory was adopted to a wider range of industrial and economic activities.<ref name="Kim2012">{{cite book|author=Sung Chull Kim|title=North Korea under Kim Jong Il: From Consolidation to Systemic Dissonance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P3u7A04Cn-MC|date=February 16, 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8093-9|pages=90<U+2013>91}}</ref>

===Modeling theory and speed campaign===
According to the "modeling theory", liberation struggles should be portrayed so as to combine national and class struggle. This is achieved through idolizing portrayal of the North Korean people<ref name="kinu_KINU"/> and by producing role-models.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=84}}

The "speed campaign" ([[McCune<U+2013>Reischauer|MR]]: {{Hangugeo|||sokto-jon}}{{sfn|Clippinger|1981|p=294}}) calls for rapid production of films. According to Kim, by producing films as fast as possible, the overall revolutionary process is expedited.<ref name="kinu_KINU"/> The origins of the speed campaign are in the shooting of ''The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man'' in just 40 days when it was anticipated to take a full year.{{sfn|Clippinger|1981|p=294}} The practice was carried out after publication of ''On the Art of the Cinema'', too. For instance, the eight-part film series ''[[Unknown Heroes]]'' (1979-1981) was produced by following the speed campaign principle. Each film took just 45 days to produce.{{sfn|Lee|2000|p=65}} Subsequently speed campaigns have been carried out not only in art, but also economic matters.{{sfn|Clippinger|1981|p=294}} It was thought of as equally important with Kim Il-sung's [[Chollima movement]], and remains an influential concept associated with Kim Jong-il's leadership.{{sfn|Clippinger|1981|pp=294-295|ps=: "Its roots go back to 1971 when Kim Chong-il [...] was guiding the filming of 'Destiny of a Self Defense Force Member.' [...] [U]nder young Kim's guidance the entire filming, which normally would have taken a whole year, was completed in only 40 days. [...] The speed battle concept was introduced into the economic sector in late 1973 and early 1974[.] [...] As one of Kim Chong-il's major innovations, the speed battle symbol is intimately associated with him and has lost none of its vitality since its introduction in late 1973. In mid-1979 speed battle was given virtually coequal status with the Kim Il-song-inspired Ch'ollima Movement[.]"}}

==Influence==
[[File:Pyongyang Film Studios 2.JPG|thumb|A statue of Kim Il-sung with a film crew at the [[Pyongyang Film Studios]]. ''On the Art of the Cinema'' reformulated many ideas of Kim Il-sung on art to be specific to cinema, and helped Kim Jong-il gain support to ensure his succession.|alt=Bronze statue of Kim Il-sung and six other people with camera, a flower basket and a notebook.]]
The work is considered the most authoritative guide on filmmaking in North Korea.{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=234}} However, the real extent of its influence is doubted. According to [[Johannes Sch<U+00F6>nherr]], the work offers little new to North Korean cinema{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=54}} and many of the ideas presented are unoriginal and obvious, particularly to the specialist audience of professional filmmakers Kim Jong-il is writing for. Films from before and after the publication of the treatise are remarkably similar, suggesting that it had little impact on North Korean film industry in practice.{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=55}} Many traits of contemporary North Korean cinema, such as repetitiveness, slow editing style and old theatrical acting, go against the teachings of ''On the Art of the Cinema''.<ref name="Wayne2005">{{cite book|last=Wayne|first=Mike|title=Understanding film: Marxist perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JLXaAAAAMAAJ|date=July 2005|accessdate=April 7, 2015|publisher=Pluto|isbn=978-0-7453-1993-3|page=204}}</ref> Whatever change there was in North Korean cinema, can be attributed to political and economic pressures.{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=56}} Instead of contributing anything new, the work reformulates Kim Il-sung's ideas about the importance of film to art and as a propaganda tool. Rather than the theoretical breakthrough it is taught as, it is an account of Kim Jong-il's personal experiences in the film industry and an attempt to thwart sloppy practices.{{sfn|Sch<U+00F6>nherr|2012|p=54}}

According to Sch<U+00F6>nherr, Kim Jong-il himself considered his ''On the Art of the Cinema'' a failure, which directly prompted him to kidnap [[Shin Sang-ok]] in 1978.<ref name="Edwards2013">{{cite journal |last=Edwards|first=Russell |date=2013 |title=North Korean cinema: A history [Book Review] |url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=501359913659263;res=IELAPA |journal=Metro |publisher=[[Australian Teachers of Media]]|volume=175 |issue= |pages=120 |doi=|access-date=April 6, 2015|quote=Sch<U+00F6>nherr also says Kim knew his 1989 book ''On the Art of Cinema'' was a failure and that this was his primary motivation for arranging the 'kidnapping' of Shin Sang-ok from Hong Kong.|subscription=yes}}</ref><ref name="Savage2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-16245174 |title=Kim Jong-il: The cinephile despot |last1=Savage |first1=Mark |last2= |first2= |date=December 19, 2011 |agency=[[BBC]] |publisher= |access-date=April 6, 2015}}</ref> Nevertheless, Shin reportedly studied ''On the Art of the Cinema'' to please Kim Jong-il with the ''[[kaij<U+016B>]]'' film ''[[Pulgasari]]'',<ref name="Morris2013">{{Cite web| title = KIM JONG IL<U+2019>S MONSTER: THE MAKING OF PULGASARI| last = Morris | first = Leslie| work = Monster Pictures| date = July 12, 2013| accessdate = April 7, 2015| url = http://monsterpictures.com.au/features/kim-jong-ils-monster-the-making-of-pulgasari/}}</ref> which credits Kim Jong-il as the executive producer.<ref name="Savage2011"/>

However, the treatise had political consequences. At the time of writing ''On the Art of the Cinema'', Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|succession]].{{sfn|David-West|2009|p=14}} By authoring the work, Kim Jong-il gained social and political power,{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=242}} and secured Kim Il-sung's confidence, making the former's assuming of leadership of the country possible.{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=235}}

''On the Art of the Cinema'' is mandatory reading for North Korean students of literature.{{sfn|Kwak|2013|p=237}} The work's influence goes beyond North Korea as Australian [[Anna Broinowski]] directed ''[[Aim High in Creation!]]'', a movie about making a propaganda film abiding by Kim Jong-il's instructions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2014/03/31/aim-high-creation-anna-broinowski-interview |title=Aim High in Creation!: Anna Broinowski interview  |last1=Mathieson |first1=Craig |last2= |first2= |authorlink1=Craig Mathieson |date=February 24, 2015 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref>
