A '''martyr''' ([[language|Greek]]: <U+03BC><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03C4><U+03C5><U+03C2>, ''m<U+00E1>rtys'', "witness"; [[Word stem|stem]] <U+03BC><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03C4><U+03C5><U+03C1>-, ''m<U+00E1>rtyr-'') is somebody who suffers [[persecution]] and death for refusing to renounce, or accept, a belief or cause, usually religious.

==Meaning==
In its original meaning, the word martyr, meaning [[witness]], was used in the secular sphere as well as in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]].<ref>See e.g. Alison A. Trites, ''The New Testament Concept of Witness'', ISBN 0-521-60934-8 and ISBN 978-0-521-60934-0.</ref> The process of bearing witness was not intended to lead to the death of the witness, although it is known from ancient writers (e.g. [[Josephus]]) and from the New Testament that witnesses often died for their testimonies.

During the [[early Christian]] centuries, the term acquired the extended meaning of a believer who is called to witness for their religious belief, and on account of this witness, endures suffering and/or death. The term, in this later sense, entered the [[English language]] as a [[loanword]]. The death of a martyr or the value attributed to it is called ''martyrdom''.

The early Christians who first began to use the term ''martyr'' in its new sense saw [[Jesus]] as the first and greatest martyr, on account of his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].<ref>Frances M. Young, ''The Use of Sacrificial Ideas in Greek Christian Writers from the New Testament to John Chrysostom'' (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2004), pp. 107.</ref><ref>[[Eusebius]] wrote of the early Christians: "They were so eager to imitate Christ ... they gladly yielded the title of martyr to Christ, the true Martyr and Firstborn from the dead." Eusebius, ''Church History'' 5.1.2.</ref><ref>Scholars believe that [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] was written during the period when the word for ''witness'' was gaining its meaning of ''martyr''. Revelation describes several Christian martyrdoms with the term ''martyr'' (Rev 17:6, 12:11, 2:10-13), and describes Jesus in the same way ("Jesus Christ, the faithful witness/martyr" in Rev 1:5, and see also Rev 3:14).</ref> The early Christians appear to have seen Jesus as the archetypical martyr.<ref name="D. Rusk, 2011 pp. 217-229">A. J. Wallace and R. D. Rusk, ''Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation'' (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011), pp. 217-229.</ref>

The word ''martyr'' is used in English to describe a wide variety of people. However, the following table presents a general outline of common features present in stereotypical martyrdoms.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Martyrdom in Judaism}}
Martyrdom in [[Judaism]] is one of the main examples of ''[[Kiddush Hashem]]'', meaning "sanctification of God's name" through public dedication to Jewish practice. Religious martyrdom is considered one of the more significant contributions of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] to [[Western Civilization]].  [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]] recount numerous [[martyrdoms]] suffered by [[Jews]] resisting [[Hellenization|Hellenizing]] (adoption of Greek ideas or customs of a [[Hellenistic civilization]]) by their [[Seleucid]] overlords, being executed for such crimes as [[Shabbat|observing the Sabbath]], [[Brit milah|circumcising their boys]] or [[Kashrut|refusing to eat pork or meat sacrificed to foreign gods]]. According to [[W. H. C. Frend]]: <U+201C>Judaism was itself a religion of martyrdom<U+201D> and it was this <U+201C>Jewish psychology of martyrdom<U+201D> that inspired Christian martyrdom.

==Christianity==
{{main|Christian martyrs}}

[[File:Westminster Abbey C20th martyrs.jpg|thumb|From the Gallery of 20th Century Martyrs at [[Westminster Abbey]]<U+2014>l. to r. [[Mother Elizabeth of Russia]], Rev. [[Martin Luther King]], Archbishop [[Oscar Romero]] and Pastor [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]]]

In [[Christianity]], a  martyr, in accordance with the meaning of the original Greek ''martys'' in the New Testament, is one who brings a testimony, usually written or verbal. In particular, the testimony is that of the Christian [[Gospel]], or more generally, the [[Word of God]]. A Christian witness is a biblical witness whether or not death follows.<ref>See Davis, R.[http://www.newmatthewbible.org/martyr.html "Martyr, or Witness?"], New Matthew Bible Project</ref> However over time many Christian testimonies were rejected, and the witnesses put to death, and the word ''martyr'' developed its present sense. Where death ensues, the witnesses follow the example of [[Jesus]] in offering up their lives for truth.

The concept of Jesus as a martyr has recently received greater attention. Analyses of the Gospel [[Passion (Christianity)|passion narratives]] have led many scholars to conclude that they are martyrdom accounts in terms of genre and style.<ref>J. W. van Henten, "Jewish Martyrdom and Jesus<U+2019> Death" in J<U+00F6>rg Frey & Jens Schr<U+00F6>ter (eds.), ''Deutungen des Todes Jesu im Neuen Testament'' (T<U+00FC>bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005) pp. 157 <U+2013> 168.</ref><ref>Donald W.

Shepherd (eds.), ''The Trial and Death of Jesus: Essays on the Passion Narrative in Mark'' (Leuven: Peeters, 2006), pp. 189 <U+2013> 203.</ref> Several scholars have also concluded that [[Paul the Apostle]] understood Jesus' death as a martyrdom.<ref>Stephen Finlan, ''The Background and Content of Paul<U+2019>s Cultic Atonement Metaphors'' (Atlanta, GA: SBL, 2004), pp. 193 <U+2013> 210</ref><ref>Sam K.

Cummins, ''Paul and the Crucified Christ in Antioch'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001).</ref> In light of such conclusions, some have argued that the Christians of the first few centuries would have interpreted the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] as a martyrdom.<ref name="D. Rusk, 2011 pp. 217-229"/><ref>Stephen J. Patterson, ''Beyond the Passion: Rethinking the Death and Life of Jesus'' (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 2004).</ref>

In the context of church history, from the time of the persecution of early Christians in the [[Roman Empire]], it developed that a martyr was one who was killed for maintaining a [[religion|religious]] belief, ''knowing'' that this will almost certainly result in imminent death (though without intentionally seeking [[death]]). This definition of ''martyr'' is not specifically restricted to the Christian faith. The first Christian witness to be killed for his testimony was [[Saint Stephen]] (whose name means "crown"), and those who suffer martyrdom are said to have been "crowned." From the time of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] Christianity became the religion of the realm and there was less and less persecution. As some wondered how then they could most closely follow Christ there was a development of ''desert spirituality'', desert monks, self mortification, [[ascetics]], ([[Paul the Hermit]], [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]]), following Christ by separation from the world. This was  a kind of ''white martyrdom'', dying to oneself  every day, as opposed to a ''red martyrdom'', the giving of ones life in a violent death.<ref>''[[Arena (TV series)|Arena]]'', ''Saints'', directed by Paul Tickell, 2006</ref>

Some Christians view death in [[sectarian]] persecution, as well as religious persecution, as martyrdom. In Christian history, [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]] recounts religious persecutions during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Yet even more modern day accounts of martyrdom for Christ exist, shown in books such as ''[[Jesus Freaks (book)|Jesus Freaks]]''.

===The Lollards===
[[File:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|right|Richard II watches [[Wat Tyler]]'s death and addresses the peasants in the background: taken from the [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Gruuthuse manuscript]] of [[Jean Froissart|Froissart]]'s ''Chroniques'' (c.&nbsp;1475).]]
'''[[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]]''' (c. 1338 <U+2013> 15 July 1381) was an English [[Lollard]] priest who took a prominent part in the [[Peasants' Revolt of 1381]].  He gained considerable fame as a roving preacher <U+2014> a "hedge priest" without a parish or any cure linking him to the established order <U+2014> by expounding the doctrines of [[John Wycliffe]], and especially by his insistence on [[social equality]].  His utterances brought him into conflict with [[Simon of Sudbury]], then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and [[Lord Chancellor]]. Ball was thrown into prison on three occasions. He also appears to have been excommunicated; owing to which, in 1366 it was forbidden to hear him preach.  These measures, however, did not moderate his opinions, nor diminish his popularity; his words had a considerable effect in fomenting a riot which broke out in June 1381.  Ball was in the archbishop's prison at Maidstone, Kent when the uprising began; he was quickly released by the Kentish rebels.<ref name="Chisholm, Hugh 1911">One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed (1911). "Ball, John (priest)". Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. 3 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.</ref>  He preached to them at Blackheath (the insurgents' gathering place near Greenwich) in an open-air sermon that included the following:

<blockquote>When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?  From the beginning all men by nature were created alike, and our bondage or servitude came in by the unjust oppression of naughty men. For if God would have had any bondmen from the beginning, he would have appointed who should be bond, and who free. And therefore I exhort you to consider that now the time is come, appointed to us by God, in which ye may (if ye will) cast off the yoke of bondage, and recover liberty.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_reading_revolt.shtml  BBC: Voices of the powerless - readings from original sources]</ref><ref>[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/richint.htm  Literature of Richard II's Reign and the Peasants' Revolt. Edited by James M. Dean.  Originally Published in ''Medieval English Political Writings.'' Kalamazoo, MI. Medieval Institute Publications (1996)]</ref></blockquote>

When the rebels had dispersed, Ball was taken prisoner at Coventry, given a trial in which, unlike most, he was permitted to speak, and hanged, drawn and quartered in the presence of [[King Richard II]] on 15 July 1381, his head subsequently stuck on a pike on London Bridge. Ball, who was called by [[Froissart]] "the mad priest of Kent," seems to have possessed eloquence and the gift of rhyme. He voiced the feelings of a section of the discontented lower orders of society at that time,<ref name="Chisholm, Hugh 1911"/> who chafed at [[villeinage]] and the lords' rights of unpaid labour, or [[corv<U+00E9>e]].

==Islam==
{{main|Shahid}}
In Arabic, a martyr is termed ''[[shahid]]'', <U+0634><U+0647><U+064A><U+062F>. ''Shaheed'' appears in the Quran in a variety of contexts, including witnessing to righteousness<!--  (<span class="plainlinks">[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/002.qmt.html Quran 2:143]</span>) -->, witnessing a financial transaction<!-- (<span class="plainlinks">[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/002.qmt.html Quran 2:282]</span>) --> and being killed, even in an accident as long as it doesn't happen with the intention to commit a sin, when they are believed to remain alive making them witnesses over worldly events without taking part in them anymore (<span class="plainlinks">[http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/quran/verses/003-qmt.php Quran 3:140]</span>). The word also appears with these various meanings in the ''[[hadith]]'', the sayings of [[Muhammad]].

==Hinduism==
Despite the promotion of ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) within [[Santana Dharma]], there is also the concept of righteous (''[[dharma]]''), where violence is used as a last resort after all other means have failed. Examples of this are found in the [[Mahabharata]].  Upon completion of their exile, the Pandavas were refused the return of their portion of the kingdom by their cousin Duruyodhana; and following which all means of peace talks by [[Krishna]], [[Vidura]] and [[Sanjaya]] failed.  During the great war which commenced, even [[Arjuna]] was brought down with doubts, e.g., attachment, sorrow, fear. This is where Krishna instructs [[Arjuna]] how to carry out his duty as a righteous [[warrior]] and fight.

==Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> faith==
{{main|Martyrdom in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith}}
In the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]], a martyr is one who sacrifices their life serving humanity in the name of God.<ref name="winters_conclusion">{{cite book | title =Dying for God: Martyrdom in the Shii and Babi Religions | first = Jonah | last = Winters | date = 1997-09-19 | accessdate = 2007-01-23 | chapter = Conclusion | url =  http://bahai-library.com/theses/dying/dying8.conclusion.html | publisher = M.A. Thesis}}</ref> However, [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]], the founder of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, discouraged the literal meaning of sacrificing one's life.

{{Main|Martyrdom in Sikhism}}
Martyrdom (called ''shaheed'' in Punjabi) is a fundamental concept in [[Sikhism]] and represents an important institution of the faith. The Sikh Gurus and Sikh with and after them are the biggest examples of martyrs. They fought against Mughal tyranny and oppression hence upholding the fundamentals of Sikhism. And in which their lives were taken. During protesting non-violently or in battles.

Bhagat Singh is usually interpreted in India as a Sikh martyr. Though there were many silent acts of martyrdom during the independence struggle of India against the British. It is usually considered that though being under 2% of India's population, Sikh contribution to Independence struggle against only British was more than 70% of the total figures. For instance, of 120+ people hanged, 90+ were Sikhs, out of 2200+ sent to life imprisonment 1900+ were Sikhs.

A larger contribution had come during the 18th century against Mughals and Afghans.

== Chinese culture ==
{{main|Martyrdom in Chinese culture}}
Martyrdom was extensively promoted by the [[Tongmenghui]] and the [[Kuomintang]] party in modern China, revolutionaries who died fighting against the Qing dynasty in the [[Xinhai Revolution]] and throughout the [[Republic of China]] period, furthering the cause of the revolution, were recognized as martyrs.

==Trade Union Martyrs==
The '''[[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]''' were a group of 19th century agricultural labourers in [[Dorset]], England, who were arrested for and convicted of swearing a secret oath as members of the ''Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers.'' The rules of the society showed it was clearly structured as a [[friendly society]], that is, a mutual association for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or cooperative banking; and it operated as a trade-specific [[benefit society]]. But at the time, friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the principal role of [[trade union]]s, and wages were at issue. The Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced to [[penal transportation|transportation]] to [[Australia]], a harsh form of exile.<ref>[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/TolpuddleMartyrs.htm  "The Tolpuddle Martyrs", Historic-UK.com]</ref>
