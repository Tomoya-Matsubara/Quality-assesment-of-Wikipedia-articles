"'''Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo'''" is the tenth episode of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on December 17, 1997. In the episode, the [[Judaism|Jewish]] character [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] feels excluded from the rest of town during [[Christmas]], and is comforted by [[List of other South Park residents#Mr. Hankey|Mr. Hankey]], a talking and singing Christmas [[feces|poo]]. Mr. Hankey does not come alive in front of anyone else, so everyone begins to think Kyle is losing his mind. Meanwhile, the townspeople remove all religious aspects of Christmas from South Park in order to remain politically correct and inoffensive.

The episode was written and directed by series co-founders [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], and was rated [[Television content rating systems#United States|TV-MA L]] in the United States. The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea from Parker's childhood; when Parker and Stone first conceived the ''South Park'' series, they wanted to make Mr. Hankey the lead character. "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was the first ''South Park'' Christmas special and first musical episode. It served as a satire of political correctness and religious sensitivity. Parker and Stone felt the episode elevated ''South Park'' to a new level of popularity and relevance.

The episode received generally positive reviews and is largely considered one of the classic ''South Park'' episodes. It was viewed by about 4.5 million households during its original broadcast, the highest [[Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen Rating]] to that point for ''South Park'' and the fourth-highest overall basic cable entertainment program of 1997. The episode was heavily influenced by the ''[[Peanuts]]'' Christmas special, ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''. In addition to Mr. Hankey himself, the episode introduced such recurring characters as [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]] and [[List of other South Park residents#Father Maxi|Priest Maxi]], as well as the popular ''South Park'' songs "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" and "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". [[John Kricfalusi]], the creator of ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]'', accused Parker and Stone of stealing the idea for Mr. Hankey from him, which the duo vehemently denied.

==Plot==
[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is playing [[Saint Joseph|Joseph of Nazareth]] in the South Park Elementary School's [[Christmas]] [[Nativity scene|nativity play]], but he is forced to quit when his [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|mother]] hears of the play and expresses outrage that her [[Judaism|Jewish]] son is being forced to participate in a [[Christianity|Christian]] production. She demands that the religious elements be taken out of the public school, and threatens to take her case to the mayor. Kyle instead suggests he sing the "[[List of other South Park residents#Mr. Hankey|Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]" song as a non-religious substitute, but he is rejected because nobody else believes in Mr. Hankey. Kyle leaves the school feeling lonely and outcast because he cannot celebrate Christmas with everyone else.

[[Mayor McDaniels]] decides that anything offensive to anyone will be removed from the Christmas celebrations, including [[Santa Claus]], wreaths, trees, stars, lights, candy canes and mistletoe. Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey, the living and talking Christmas [[feces|fecal matter]], as a non-religious Christmas icon since he doesn't discriminate against anyone. At home, he is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. However, while brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey actually comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey leaps at [[Cartman]]'s face as he sings "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]], but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee. Cartman, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] believe Kyle is insane and check him into a [[mental institution]].

Like the whole town, the school Christmas pageant is stripped of all symbols of Christmas, and the children instead present a [[minimalist music|minimalist]] song and dance created by composer [[Philip Glass]]. The parents, astounded by how awful the pageant has turned out, begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out. When [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] finds out where Kyle is, he reveals to the children that Mr. Hankey does actually exist. When all the children start believing, Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for losing sight of the good things of Christmas and focusing on the bad. The townspeople release Kyle from the asylum and apologize, then they all sing Christmas songs and watch Mr. Hankey fly away with Santa Claus. The episode ends, and Kenny is excited and relieved that he has survived the entire episode without getting killed. During the end credits, [[Jesus (South Park)|Jesus]] sings "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]" to himself alone in his television studio.

The episode also features a fake live-action commercial for a do-it-yourself Mr. Hankey kit. In the commercial, a mother and her two children attach accessories to actual stool samples to make their own Mr. Hankey dolls. The commercial alludes at the end that the baby of the family eats her stool rather than making the doll.

===Conception and early history===
The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea [[Trey Parker]]'s father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child.<ref name="CNS1222">{{Cite news |last=Houston |first=David |title=South Park |work=City News Service |date=1997-12-22 |location=[[Los Angeles]]}}</ref> Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool, which he called "Mr. Hankey", it would come to life and kill him.<ref name="Time0323">{{Cite news |last1=Collins |first1=James |last2=Ressner |first2=Jeffrey |title=Gross and Grosser |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1998-03-23 |location=[[Los Angeles]] |page=74}}</ref> The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later don in ''South Park''.<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|year=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> Parker shared the concept with future ''South Park'' co-creator [[Matt Stone]] when the two met at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Littlefield |first=Kinney |title=Comedy Central scores with poop and circumstance;

They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor's coffee mug and the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future ''South Park'' episode "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", with the notable exception of the ending. In the episode, Kyle would play the boy and Mr. Mackey would play the counselor.<ref name="Commentary" />

Although the Mr. Hankey short film was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related animated short films called ''[[The Spirit of Christmas]]'', which served as precursors to the ''South Park'' series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived the idea of a ''South Park''-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend [[Brian Graden]], then a television executive with the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode.<ref name="Commentary" /> Later, when [[Comedy Central]] expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, "One thing we have to know before we really go any further: how do you feel about talking poo?" The executives were receptive to the idea,<ref name="DMN0201">{{Cite news |last=Vognar |first=Chris |title=Brats entertainment; "South Park" creators potty hardy on Comedy Central show |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=1998-02-01 |location=[[Pasadena, California]] |page=1C}}</ref> which Parker said was one of the main reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.<ref name="Commentary" />

The elements of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone is [[Who_is_a_Jew%3F#.22Ethnic_Jew.22|ethnically Jewish]], he was not raised a practicing Jew and so he did not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own [[Hanukkah]] song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said it only made her feel more lonely and isolated.<ref name="Commentary" />

===Episode production===
[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|330px|right|''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] wrote "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".]]"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was written and directed by Parker and Stone, and first aired in the United States on [[Comedy Central]] on December 17, 1997, with a rating of [[Television content rating systems#United_States|TV-MA]].<ref name="SL1217" /> It was the first official ''South Park'' Christmas episode.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Edel |first=Raymond A. |title=Television News & Notes |work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] |date=1997-12-09 |page=Y06}}</ref> Television journalists said the ''Spirit of Christmas'' shorts were precursors to Mr. Hankey and that they shared some common traits, but that the television episode was considered tamer and more tasteful.<ref name="NYDN1217">{{Cite news |last=Bianculli |first=David |title="Park" rings with Christmas jeer |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=[[New York]] |date=1997-12-17 |page=79}}</ref><ref name="FTU1217">{{Cite news |last=Patton |first=Charlie |title="South Park" puts own spin on Christmas |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |location=[[Jacksonville, Florida]] |date=1997-12-17 |page=C-5}}</ref> Parker and Stone originally conceived the episode "[[Damien (South Park)|Damien]]", which involves a boxing match between [[Jesus (South Park)|Jesus]] and [[Satan (South Park)|Satan]], as the first season's Christmas episode. Although they had long planned to feature Mr. Hankey in the show, they did not decide to make him a Christmas character until halfway through the filming of "Damien". Once they made the decision, they decided to make "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" the holiday episode instead; although it would not air until after the "Mr. Hankey" episode, Parker and Stone finished production of "Damien" before working on the "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".<ref name>{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|year=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: "Damien"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>

At the time they were writing the episode, Parker and Stone had seen a large number of news reports about government buildings refusing to allow the display of models of the [[nativity scene]] and other [[Christianity|Christian]] holiday symbols, in an effort not to offend other religions. Parker and Stone, as two [[agnosticism|agnostics]] who still appreciated the Christmas holiday, said they felt the idea was "ridiculous"<ref name="Commentary" /> and, according to Stone, "We just wanted Mr. Hankey to say Christmas was about good and about presents, and it doesn't have to be this religious (controversy)."<ref name="Commentary" /> The two sought to write an episode in the tradition of old classic Christmas specials with their own irreverent ''South Park'' twist, and so they watched the famous 1965 ''[[Peanuts]]'' special, ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'', repeatedly during the production process. Parker said, "At this point, we just sort of wanted to do a Charlie Brown Christmas ''South Park'' version. That (special) was definitely a huge part of my life growing up."<ref name="Commentary" />

The episode was considered the first ''South Park'' musical episode, and included such songs as "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" and "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, "The general rule was people hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey would prove to be real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character [[Aloysius Snuffleupagus|Mr. Snuffleupagus]] in the children's show ''[[Sesame Street]]''; for the first 14 years of the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by [[Big Bird]], which Parker said "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of [[Mickey Mouse]] in the [[1928 in film|1928]] cartoon ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted it into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a [[McMuffin|Sausage McMuffin]] at a [[McDonald's]] in [[New York City]], while taking a break from promoting ''South Park'' to the press.<ref name="Commentary" />

Although Comedy Central did not object to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to material they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a [[Nativity play]], a [[Child Jesus|baby Jesus]] resembling a [[fetus]] pops out of [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]], who is playing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executive had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool (actually chocolate) and took a bite out of it. Comedy Central officials would not allow the scene in the episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier.<ref name="Commentary" />

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" is the first episode in which Kenny was not killed. Parker and Stone deliberately included several scenes that looked like they might lead to Kenny's death, but they decided because it was Christmas that they would not kill him. The episode was also the first time [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] was portrayed as an [[antisemitism|anti-semite]] and [[racism|racist]], particularly when he asks [[List of other South Park residents#Mayor McDaniels|Mayor McDaniels]] if she can get rid of all the [[Mexico|Mexicans]] in ''South Park''. Parker said this decision was made because, "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally. A person that disturbed being a racist is funny to us."<ref name="Commentary" />

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" is a satire on political correctness and religious sensitivity, particularly in its portrayal of the characters organizing "The Happy, Non-Offensive, Non-Denominational Christmas Play" in order to avoid offending anyone of any religious backgrounds.<ref name="Commentary" /><ref name="SL1217">{{Cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title=Comedy Central doesn't think it funny as Craig Kilborn trips over his tongue |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |location=[[Newark, New Jersey]] |date=1997-12-17 |page=41}}</ref> While many Christmas specials focus on the religious, spiritual and moral values of the Christmas holiday rather than the commercial aspects, "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" actually embraces [[commercialism]] in Christmas, suggesting viewers should enjoy those elements of the holiday without taking religion too seriously.

Alison Halsall said "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" is the strongest example of a history of [[scatology]], the study of excrement, throughout the ''South Park'' series. Halsall said the use of fecal matter as a character, and especially its tendency to smear parts of itself around as it moved, direct confronts the viewer with "the inherent dirtiness of the human body, no matter how much we try to aestheticize it. Mr. Hankey's stains systematically mess up the cleanliness of the social order.&nbsp;... South Park refuses sanitization through the gross-out factor."<ref name="Halsall" />

==Cultural impact and references==
Some writers consider Mr. Hankey one of the most easily recognizable and popular of the non-regular ''South Park'' characters.

In addition to the title character, "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" included the first appearances of characters [[List of other South Park residents#Father Maxi|Priest Maxi]] and [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]]. Both characters appeared in "Damien", which was produced before "Mr. Hankey", but the Christmas episode aired first. Mr. Mackey was inspired by Parker's real-life school guidance counselor; Parker, who provides the voice for Mackey, said the real-life counselor was similarly thin and wiry and that Parker's voice for Mr. Mackey is an exact, unexaggerated version of how his counselor spoke.<ref name="Commentary" />

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" includes several references to ''Peanuts'' holiday special, ''A Charlie Brown Christmas''. A Christmas pageant features the same biblical quote spoken by [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] in that special; additionally, the music featured in the pageant is very similar to the ''Peanuts'' special's musical score by [[Vince Guaraldi]], and the South Park kids go outside to catch falling snowflake on their tongues in the same way as in the special.<ref name="NYDN1217" /> A doctor prescribes [[Prozac]], a real life [[antidepressant]], to Kyle for his apparent love for feces, which he describes as "fecalphilia", a fictional condition.<ref name="Rec1217">{{Cite news |last=Rohan |first=Virginia |title=Over the top and down the other side |work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] |date=1997-12-17 |page=Y02}}</ref> Composer [[Philip Glass]] composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play.<ref name="SL1217" /> Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader to sit down at a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one would know the difference."<ref name="Commentary" /> The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the [[Mr. Potato Head]] toy set.<ref name="DrawnTo" />

==Reception==
===Reviews and ratings===
Although Parker and Stone credit "[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]" as helping elevate the series, they felt "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" elevated South Park to a new level of popularity and relevance. Parker said of it, "This was the episode that just vaulted everything."<ref name="Commentary" /> Stone said although it has become less shocking with time, viewers at the time of the episode's original broadcast were shocked, and some were horrified, at the idea of a living and speaking Christmas stool.<ref name="Commentary" /> "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was the fourth-highest overall basic cable entertainment program of 1997.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Grennan |first=Karin |title=Going down to "South Park": The most talked about 30 minutes on television are also the most offensive.

"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" has been described as one of the classic episodes of ''South Park''.<ref name="DrawnTo" /><ref name="Pratt">{{Cite book |last=Pratt |first=Doug |title= Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More! |year=2005 |publisher=UNET 2 Corporation |isbn= 1932916016 |page=1126}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author=Editors of [[TV Guide]] |title=TV Guide: TV on DVD 2006: The Ultimate Resource to Television Programs on DVD |year=2005 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Griffin]] |isbn=031235150X |page=221}}</ref> Chris Vognar of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' described Mr. Hankey himself as "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show".<ref name="DMN0201" /> Charlie Patton of the ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]'' said the episode was "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive -- also extremely funny".<ref name="FTU1217" /> He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, "If you're the sort of person who didn't care for that scene in ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' where the [[Ewan McGregor]] character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing."<ref name="FTU1217" /> Doug Pratt, a [[DVD]] reviewer and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' contributor, said, "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?"<ref name="Pratt" /> Diane Werts of ''[[Newsday]]'' said of the episode, "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year."<ref name="Werts" /> Werts particularly praised the song "A Lonely Jew on Christmas".<ref name="Werts">{{Cite news |last=Werts |first=Diane |title=Flash!

Before the episode was released, [[Debbie Liebling]], then Comedy Central vice president of development and production, herself described the episode as "adorably offensive".<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Fretts |first1=Bruce |last2=Baldwin |first2=Kristen |title=What to Watch; A day-to-day guide to notable programs |work=[[USA Today]] |date=1997-12-19 |page=65}}</ref> Alan Sepinwall of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' called the episode "a brilliant skewering"<ref name="SL1217" /> of political correctness and oversensitivity, and called it "at once hilariously satiric and extraordinarily foul."<ref name="SL1217" /> Sepinwall also Mr. Hankey in his 1997 list of most memorable TV moments, describing the character as the year's "most disturbing cartoon image"<ref name="Sepinwall" /> and as "a mythical holiday creature so bizarre and offensive it literally cannot be described in a family newspaper".<ref name="Sepinwall">{{Cite news |last1=Sepinwall |first1=Alan |last2=Seitz |first2=Matt Zoller |title=Moments to remember |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |location=[[Newark, New Jersey]] |date=1997-12-29 |page=49}}</ref> Matt Roush of ''[[USA Today]]'' praised the episode, which he described as "ribald, raunchy and riotous".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Roush |first=Matt |title=Naughty season's greetings from "South Park" |work=[[USA Today]] |date-1997-12-17 |page=3D}}</ref> A.J.

The music in "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" was also praised. "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" has been described as a "classic song",<ref>{{cite book |title=5000 Episodes and No Commercials: The Ultimate Guide to TV Shows on DVD 2007 |last=Hofstede |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=[[Back Stage|Back Stage Books]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=0823084566 |page=340}}</ref> and "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch", which reviewers described as one of Cartman's trademarks,<ref name="DrawnTo" /> was included in the 1999 ''South Park'' film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''.<ref name="Commentary" /> Not all reviews of "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" were positive.

In 2003, the [[Chicago]]-based ''[[RedEye]]'' ranked "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" the greatest ''South Park'' episode.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Celebrate with cheesy poofs |date=2003-04-09 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=64 |location=[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] |page=64}}</ref> In October 2004, the Comedy Central website held a poll to determine the top 27 ''South Park'' episodes for a television marathon; "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo" came third, just behind "[[Good Times with Weapons]]" at number two and "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]" at number one.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Have we really experienced eight seasons of "South Park"? |work=[[The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead]] |location=[[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]] |date=2004-10-22}}</ref> ''South Park Studios'', the official ''South Park'' website, listed "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" at number four on its list of the Five Most Notorious Episodes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Could you please list the Five Most Notorious Episodes in order? |date=2002-06-25 |work=[[South Park|South Park Studios]] |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=13530 |accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>

===''Ren & Stimpy'' controversy===
[[John Kricfalusi]], the creator of ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]'', claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, "Nutty the Friendly Dump", which was part of a cartoon book series viewable online. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, "I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!&nbsp;... This idea of (poop) singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea."<ref name="CNS1222" /> Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of ''South Park'' were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company [[Sp<U+00FC>mc<U+00F8>]] was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone.<ref name="DV1222">{{Cite news |last=Richmond |first=Ray |title="Park" ploy poohed-poohed |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |date=1997-12-22 |page=31}}</ref> Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with "Nutty the Friendly Dump" and that the claim was "ludicrous".<ref name="CNS1222" /> Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of ''Ren and Stimpy'', which he said he did not enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Parker & Stone: A candid conversation with the outrageous duo behind ''South Park'' about corrupt studios, evil celebrities and why we should all see Tom Cruise's weenie |work=[[Playboy]] |date=2000-06-01 |page=65}}</ref> Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the ''South Park'' creators: "He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, I see how it could just be a coincidence, but you should just admit to the press that you're a big ''Ren & Stimpy'' fan.'
