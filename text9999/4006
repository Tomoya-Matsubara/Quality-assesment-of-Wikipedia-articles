==Music video==
The video premiered June 14, 2010 on [[VH1]] and "takes the late-night wilderness party motif of Jennifer Lopez's classic "[[Waiting for Tonight]]" clip and adds more lasers, guyliner, thrashy dance moves, silver top hats and outrageously spiky shoulder pads."<ref name="billboard">{{cite news|title Adam Lambert Goes Wild in 'If I Had You'|url=http://www.billboard.com/column/viralvideos/adam-lambert-goes-wild-in-if-i-had-you-1004097896.story#/column/viralvideos/adam-lambert-goes-wild-in-if-i-had-you-1004097896.story }}</ref> [[Bryan Barber]] directed the video, which was inspired by Lambert's self-proclaimed "psychedelic" experience at [[Burning Man]].<ref name="billboard"/>

James Montgomery from [[MTV]] describes the video as having "a clearing in the forest, one packed with party people <U+2014> of all races, colors, creeds and proclivities, naturally <U+2014> who are all in the midst of a totally excellent celebration. (Most of said party people are actually Lambert's friends, from his days performing with L.A.'s "Zodiac Show.")"<ref name="mtv">{{cite news|title Adam Lambert's 'If I Had You' Video Frolics In Politics |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641489/20100614/lambert_adam_american_idol_.jhtml#fbid=VzsGKAIxm89 }}</ref>   Montgomery states the message of the video is "Humanity can, in fact, put their differences aside and just dance."<ref name="mtv"/>
