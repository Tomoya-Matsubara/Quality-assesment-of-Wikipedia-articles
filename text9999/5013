The '''Macintosh Classic''' was a [[personal computer]] manufactured by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. Introduced on October 15, 1990, it was the first [[Apple Macintosh]] to sell for less than US$1,000.<ref name="debut">{{Cite news

The system specifications of the Classic were very similar to its predecessors, with the same {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=on}} [[monochrome]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display, 512&times;342&nbsp;[[pixel]] resolution, and 4&nbsp;[[megabyte]] (MB) [[Random access memory|memory]] limit of the older Macintosh computers.<ref name="specs">{{cite web

Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the aging Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. It was up to 25&nbsp;percent faster than the Plus and included an [[SuperDrive|Apple SuperDrive]] {{convert|3.5|in|cm|0|adj=on}} [[floppy disk drive]] as standard.

The Classic was an adaptation of [[Jerry Manock]]'s and Terry Oyama's 1984 [[Macintosh 128K]] industrial design, as had been the earlier Macintosh SE. Apple released two versions that ranged from $1,000 to $1,500. Reviewers' reactions were mixed; most focused on the slow [[Central processing unit|processor]] performance and lack of [[Expansion card|expansion slots]]. The consensus was that the Classic was only useful for word processing, spreadsheets and databases. The lower price and the availability of education software led to the Classic's popularity in education. It was sold alongside the more powerful [[Macintosh Classic II]] in 1991 until its discontinuation the next year.

==History==
=== Development ===
After Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] left Apple in 1985, product development was handed to [[Jean-Louis Gass<U+00E9>e]], formerly manager of Apple France. Gass<U+00E9>e consistently pushed the Apple product line in two directions, towards more "openness" in terms of expandability and interoperability, and towards higher price. Gass<U+00E9>e long argued that Apple should not market their computers towards the low end of the market, where profits were thin, but instead concentrate on the high end and higher profit margins. He illustrated the concept using a graph showing the [[price/performance ratio]] of computers with low-power, low-cost machines in the lower left and high-power high-cost machines in the upper right. The "high-right" goal became a mantra among the upper management, who said "fifty-five or die", referring to Gass<U+00E9>e's goal of a 55 percent profit margin.<ref>{{Cite book

The high-right policy led to a series of machines with ever-increasing prices. The original Macintosh plans called for a system around $1000, but it was released at $2495.<ref>{{Cite book

}}.</ref> From there, the price of Mac systems continued to climb: the [[Macintosh Plus]] was slightly more expensive at $2599, the SE was $2900 or $3900 depending on the model, and a basic [[Macintosh II]] was at least $5500. More modern machines cost even more: the [[Macintosh IIcx]] was $5369, the [[Macintosh IIci|IIci]] $6269, and the [[Macintosh IIfx|IIfx]] $9900 - all without monitors or keyboards. Color CRTs were relatively expensive in the late 1980s; Apple's 14" 640x480 monitor had a list price of $999 and Apple's [[ADB]] keyboards, while high quality, were similarly expensive. The only inexpensive machine in the lineup by the late 1980s was the several-year-old Mac Plus, which was now selling for around $2000.

Having abandoned the "low-left" of the market years earlier, and being ignored on the high end for PCs, Apple's fortunes of the 1980s quickly reversed. The Christmas season of 1989 drove this point home, with the first decrease in sales in years, and an accompanying 20 percent drop in Apple's stock price for the quarter.<ref name=c117>{{Cite journal

In January 1990, Gass<U+00E9>e resigned and his authority over product development was divided among several successors.<ref name=c117>{{Cite journal

}}.</ref> Many Apple engineers had long been pressing for lower-cost options in order to build market share and increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gass<U+00E9>e out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three systems were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, [[Macintosh LC]], and [[Macintosh IIsi]].<ref name=c117/>

=== Release ===

''[[MacWEEK]]'' magazine reported on July 10, 1990 that Apple had paid $1&nbsp;million to Modular Computer Systems Inc., a subsidiary of [[Daimler-Benz AG]], for the right to use the "Classic" name as part of a five-year contract.<ref name="classicspeculation">{{Cite news

The Classic was released in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] concurrently with the [[United States]] release. In Japan, the Classic retailed for 198,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]] ($1,523),<ref name="japan">{{Cite news

==Features==
The low-end model had 1&nbsp;MB memory, no [[hard disk]], and cost $999, while the $1,499 model contained an additional 1&nbsp;MB memory expansion card and a 40&nbsp;MB hard disk. The Classic featured several improvements over the [[Macintosh Plus]], which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer: it was up to 25&nbsp;percent faster than the Plus and included an [[SuperDrive|Apple SuperDrive]] 3.5" [[floppy disk drive]] as standard.<ref name="desc">{{cite web

The Classic used the [[System 6|System 6.0.7]] [[operating system]] with support for all versions up to [[System 7|System 7.5.5]]. A hidden [[Hierarchical File System]] (HFS) disk volume contained in the [[read-only memory]] (ROM) included System 6.0.3.<ref name="romdisk">{{cite book

==Design==
[[File:Apple Keyboard II-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Apple Keyboard|Apple Keyboard II]] was the Macintosh Classic's standard keyboard.]]
The Macintosh Classic was the final adaptation of [[Jerry Manock]]'s and Terry Oyama's [[Macintosh 128K]] industrial design, bringing back some elements of the original, while retaining little of the [[Snow White design language]] used in the [[Macintosh SE]]'s design.<ref name="appledesign">{{cite book

 | page = 75
 | isbn = 1888001259}}</ref> The only remnant of the SE was the stripe across the front panel (bezel) for the floppy drive; the distinctive front bezel lines of the SE were not used on the Classic, and the vertical lines around its base were replaced by four horizontal vent lines, more reminiscent of the original design.<ref name="appledesign"/> Also, the curve of the front bezel was increased to the same {{convert|50|in|m|sing=on}} radial curve as on the front of both the [[Macintosh LC]] and [[Macintosh IIsi]].<ref name="appledesign"/> The screen brightness dial on this bezel was also removed in favor of a software control. This curved front bezel became a signature of Apple product design for much of the 1990s.<ref name="appledesign"/>

The [[Motherboard|logic board]], the central circuit board of the computer, was based on the Macintosh SE design.<ref name="mac-classic-devnote">{{cite web

This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low.<ref name="mac-classic-devnote"/> This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of [[desktop publishing]] led to such oddities as video displays which connected through the [[SCSI]] port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac.The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the [[Macintosh Classic II|Classic II]], which succeeded the Classic and replaced the [[Macintosh SE/30]].<ref name="appledesign"/>

==Reception==
Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic focused on the processor performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of ''Home Office Computing'' praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the {{convert|9|in|mm|sing=on}} display because a full US letter page (8<U+00BD> <U+00D7> 11&nbsp;inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and [[desktop publishing]] capabilities against buying the Classic.<ref name="homeofficereview">{{cite news
