==Child abuse and conviction==
Journalist [[Nick Davies]] called Righton "a notorious paedophile who attempted to legitimise his obsession in a series of academic studies."<ref name=sheer/> Righton was a founding member of the [[Paedophile Information Exchange]] (number 51).<ref name=fairweather/> Child protection manager [[Peter McKelvie]] helped in the investigation. Righton, then living in [[Evesham]], was convicted by a magistrates court in September 1992 of importing [[child pornography]] magazines and photographs after Customs and Excise intercepted material being sent to him from the Netherlands that April. A police raid on his home, where he lived with New Barns headmaster Richard Alston, uncovered other paedophile magazines, and letters to and from other paedophiles containing details of abuse. He was fined <U+00A3>900 with <U+00A3>75 costs for importing child abuse images, had the magazines destroyed, and was cautioned for an historical assault.<ref name=huffington/><ref name=independent>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/child-care-expert-fined-over-photographs-of-naked-boys-1551820.html|title=Child care expert fined over photographs of naked boys|last=Mowbray|first=Chris|date=17 September 1992|work=The Independent|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=fairweather/><ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Sheila|title=Understanding Youth And Crime: Listening to Youth?|date=2005-08-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|page=116}}</ref> The BBC's ''[[Inside Story (BBC television series)|Inside Story]]'' documentary reported in 1994 that he was allowed to leave a boarding school under a "gentleman's agreement" after being found to have abused boys.
