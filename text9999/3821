'''Poland''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Poland.ogg|/<U+02C8>po<U+028A>l<U+0259>nd/}} ({{lang-pl|Polska}}), officially the '''Republic of Poland''' (''[[Rzeczpospolita]] Polska''), is a country in [[Central Europe]]. Poland is bordered by [[Germany]] to the west; the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] to the south; [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Lithuania]] to the east; and the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], a Russian [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]], to the north. The total [[area of Poland]] is {{convert|312679|km2|sqmi}},<ref name="CSO_2008"/> making it the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|69th largest country]] in the world and 9th in Europe. Poland has a population of over 38&nbsp;million people,<ref name="CSO_2008"/> which makes it the [[List of countries by population|33rd most populous country]] in the world.<ref>NationMaster.com 2003-2007, [http://www.nationmaster.com/country/pl-poland Poland, Facts and figures]</ref>

The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of [[Christianity]] by its ruler [[Mieszko I]] in 966 (see [[Baptism of Poland]]), when the state covered territory similar to that of present-day Poland. Poland became [[Kingdom of Poland (1025<U+2013>1138)|a kingdom]] in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented a long [[Polish-Lithuanian Union|association]] with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Union of Lublin|uniting]] to form the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth collapsed in 1795, and [[Partitions of Poland|its territory was partitioned]] among [[Prussia]], [[Russia]], and [[Austria]]. Poland [[Second Polish Republic|regained its independence]] in 1918 after [[World War I]] but lost it again in [[World War II]], occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Poland lost over six million citizens in World War II, and emerged several years later as a [[People's Republic of Poland|socialist republic]] within the [[Eastern bloc|Eastern Bloc]] under strong Soviet influence. In 1989, [[Communism|communist]] rule [[fall of communism|was overthrown]] and Poland became what is constitutionally known as the "Third Polish Republic". Poland is a [[unitary state]] made up of sixteen [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] ({{lang-pl|wojew<U+00F3>dztwo}}). Poland is also a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]] and [[OECD]].

==History==
{{main|History of Poland}}

===Prehistory===
{{main|Prehistory of Poland (until 966)}}
Historians have postulated that throughout [[Late Antiquity]], many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now known as Poland. The exact [[ethnic]]ity and [[linguistic]] affiliation of these groups has been hotly debated; in particular the time and route of the original settlement of [[Slavic peoples]] in these regions has been the subject of much controversy.

The most famous archeological find from [[prehistory of Poland|Poland's prehistory]] is the [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement (now reconstructed as a museum), dating from the [[Lusatian culture]] of the early [[Iron Age]], around 700 BC.

===Piast dynasty===
{{main|History of Poland (966<U+2013>1385)}}
[[Image:Poland1020.png|thumb|left|Poland around 1020]]
Poland began to form into a recognizable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the tenth century under the [[Piast dynasty]]. [[Rulers of Poland|Poland's first historically documented ruler]], [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], [[Baptism of Poland|was baptized]] in 966, adopting [[Catholicism|Catholic Christianity]] as the nation's new [[official religion]], to which the bulk of the population converted in the course of the next centuries. In the twelfth century, Poland [[Fragmentation of Poland|fragmented into several smaller states]]. In 1320, [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I the Elbow-high|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I]] became the King of [[Kingdom of Poland (1320<U+2013>1385)|a reunified Poland]]. His son, [[Casimir III of Poland|Kazimierz III]], is remembered as one of the greatest [[Polish kings]].

Poland was also a centre of migration of peoples and the [[Jewish]] community began to settle and flourish in Poland during this era (see [[History of the Jews in Poland]]). The [[Black Death]] which affected most parts of Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not reach Poland.<ref name="REF03">Teeple, J. B. (2002). ''Timelines of World History''. Publisher: DK Adult.</ref>

===Jagiellon dynasty===
{{main|History of Poland (1385<U+2013>1569)}}
Under the [[Jagiellon dynasty]] Poland forged [[Polish-Lithuanian Union|an alliance]] with its neighbour, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In 1410, a Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive defeat on the [[Teutonic Knights]], both countries' main adversary, in the [[battle of Grunwald]]. After the [[Thirteen Years War]], the Knight's state became a Polish vassal. Polish culture and economy flourished under the Jagiellons, and the country produced such figures as astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and poet [[Jan Kochanowski]]. Compared to other European nations, Poland was exceptional in its tolerance of religious dissent, allowing the country to avoid the religious turmoil that spread over Western Europe in that time.

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{main|History of Poland (1569<U+2013>1795)}}
[[Image:SiemiginowskiJerzy.1686.JanIIISobieskiPodWiedniem.jpg|right|150px|thumb|''[[John III Sobieski]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]]''.]]
[[Image:Irp1635.png|thumb|left|The greatest extent of Poland in 1635]]
A [[Polish Golden Age|golden age]] ensued during the sixteenth century after the [[Union of Lublin]] which gave birth to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The [[szlachta]] (nobility) of Poland, far more numerous than in [[Western Europe]]an countries, took pride in [[Golden Liberty|their freedoms]] and [[Sejm|parliamentary system]]. During the Golden Age period, Poland expanded its borders to become the largest country in Europe.

In the mid-seventeenth century, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] invasion ([[The Deluge (Polish history)|"The Deluge"]]) and [[Cossack]]'s [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] which ravaged the country marked the end of the golden age. [[Polish-Russian War|Numerous wars against Russia]] coupled with government inefficiency caused by the [[Liberum Veto]], a right which had allowed any member of the parliament to dissolve it and to veto any legislation it had passed, marked the steady deterioration of the Commonwealth from a European power into a near-[[anarchy]] controlled by its neighbours. Commonwealth 's most famous achievement was to deal crushing defeat to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1683 at the [[Battle of Vienna]].

The reforms, particularly those of the [[Great Sejm]], which passed the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], the world's second modern constitution, were thwarted with the three [[partitions of Poland]] (1772, 1793, and 1795) which ended with Poland's being erased from the map and its territories being divided between Russia, [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]].

===Partitions of Poland===
{{main|History of Poland (1795<U+2013>1918)}}
Poles would resent their fate and [[List of Polish uprisings|would several times rebel against the partitioners]], particularly in the nineteenth century. In 1807 [[Napoleon]] recreated a Polish state, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], but after the [[Napoleonic wars]], Poland was again divided in 1815 by the victorious Allies at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. The eastern portion was ruled by the Russian [[Czar]] as a [[Congress Kingdom]], and possessed [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland|a liberal constitution]]. However, the Czars soon reduced Polish freedoms and Russia eventually ''de facto'' annexed the country. Later in the nineteenth century, Austrian-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], particularly the [[Free City of Krak<U+00F3>w]], became a centre of Polish cultural life.

===Reconstitution of Poland===
{{main|History of Poland (1918<U+2013>1939)}}
[[Image:Rzeczpospolita 1939.svg|thumb|left|Poland between 1922 and 1938]]

During [[World War I]], all the [[Allies]] agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed in Point 13 of his [[Fourteen Points]]. Shortly after the surrender of Germany in November 1918, Poland regained its independence as the [[Second Polish Republic]] (''II Rzeczpospolita Polska''). It reaffirmed its independence after [[List of Polish wars|a series of military conflicts]], the most notable being the [[Polish-Soviet War]] (1919<U+2013>1921) when [[battle of Warsaw (1920)|Poland inflicted a crushing defeat]] on the [[Red Army]].

[[Image:Polish Soldier's Grave Warsaw 1945.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of insurgent from [[Warsaw Uprising]]]]

The 1926 [[May Coup]] of [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]] turned the reins of the Second Polish Republic over to the [[Sanacja]] movement.

===World War II===
{{main|History of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)}}

The [[Sanacja]] movement controlled Poland until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded]] on 1 September and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|followed]] on 17 September. [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw capitulated]] on 28 September 1939. As agreed in the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]], Poland was split into two zones, [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|one occupied by Germany]] while the eastern provinces fell under [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|the control of the Soviet Union]].

[[World War II casualties|Of all the countries involved in the war]], Poland [[Treatment of Polish citizens by occupiers|lost the highest percentage of its citizens]]: over six&nbsp;million perished, [[Holocaust in Poland|half of them]] [[Polish Jew]]s. Poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, after the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[United States|Americans]]. The Polish expeditionary corps played an important role in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], particularly at the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]]. At the war's conclusion, Poland's borders [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|were shifted westwards]], pushing the [[Eastern Borderlands|eastern border]] to the [[Curzon line]]. Meanwhile, the western border was moved to the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. The new Poland emerged 20% smaller by {{convert|77500|km2|sqmi}}. The shift [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|forced the migration of millions of people]], most of whom were [[Poles]], [[Germans]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Jews]].

===Postwar Communist Poland===
{{main|History of Poland (1945<U+2013>1989)}}
[[Image:Curzon line en.svg|thumb|right|At the end of World War II, the gray territories were transferred from Poland to the Soviet Union, and the pink territories from Germany to Poland]]
[[Image:Lechu.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]] (left) leading the [[Solidarity|Solidarity movement]].]]

The [[Soviet Union]] instituted a new [[Communist state|Communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] was also part of this change. The [[People's Republic of Poland]] (''[[Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa]]'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, the r<U+00E9>gime of [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Gomu<U+0142>ka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. Similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|communist opposition]] persisted.

Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] "[[Solidarity]]" ("''Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107>''"), which over time became a political force. Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] in 1981, it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Communist Party]] and by 1989 [[Polish parliamentary election, 1989|had triumphed in parliamentary elections]]. [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]], a Solidarity candidate, eventually [[Polish presidential election, 1990|won the presidency in 1990]]. The Solidarity movement heralded the [[fall of communism|collapse of communism across Eastern Europe]].

===Democratic Poland===
{{main|History of Poland (1989<U+2013>present)}}
[[Image:Astilleros de Gdansk.jpg|thumb|left|200px|25th anniversary of [[Solidarity]].]]
A [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] programme of [[Leszek Balcerowicz]] during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into a [[market economy]]. As with all other post-communist countries, Poland suffered temporary slumps in social and economic standards, but became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] levels, which it achieved by 1995 due to its booming economy.<ref>[http://transitioneconomies.blogspot.com/2006/05/real-gdp-growth-in-ceecs.html Real GDP growth in CEECs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://polisci.lsa.umich.edu/documents/jjackson/chapt1.pdf Chapter 1 WHY POLAND?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Most visibly, there were numerous improvements in other [[human rights]], such as [[free speech]]. In 1991, Poland became a member of the [[Visegrad Group]] and joined the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance in 1999 along with the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]]. Poles then voted to join the [[European Union]] in [[Polish referenda|a referendum]] in June 2003, with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Poland}}
[[Image:polen topo.jpg|thumb|right|Poland<U+2019>s [[topography]]]]

Poland<U+2019>s territory extends across several geographical regions. In the northwest is the Baltic seacoast, which extends from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gulf of Gdansk]]. This coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]]. The center and parts of the north lie within the [[North European Plain]]. Rising gently above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising the four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]. These lake districts are the Pomeranian Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the Kashubian Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]]. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of northeastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. South of the Northern European Lowlands lie the regions of [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south lies the Polish mountain region, including the [[Sudetes]], the Cracow-Cz<U+0119>stochowa Upland, the [[<U+015A>wi<U+0119>tokrzyskie Mountains]], and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the [[Beskids]]. The highest part of the Carpathians is the [[Tatra Mountains]], along Poland<U+2019>s southern border.

===Rivers===
[[Image:Modlin spichlerz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vistula]] river in [[Modlin (village)|Modlin]].]]

The longest rivers are the [[Vistula]] ({{lang-pl|Wis<U+0142>a}}), {{convert|1047|km|mi}} long; the [[Oder River|Oder]] ({{lang-pl|Odra}}) which forms part of Poland<U+2019>s western border, {{convert|854|km|mi}} long; its tributary, the [[Warta River|Warta]], {{convert|808|km|mi}} long; and the [[Western Bug|Bug]], a tributary of the Vistula, {{convert|772|km|mi}} long. The Vistula and the Oder flow into the [[Baltic Sea]], as do numerous smaller rivers in Pomerania. The [[<U+0141>yna River|<U+0141>yna]] and the [[Angrapa River|Angrapa]] flow by way of the [[Pregolya]] to the Baltic, and the [[Czarna Ha<U+0144>cza]] flows into the Baltic through the [[Neman River|Neman]]. While the great majority of Poland<U+2019>s rivers drain into the Baltic Sea, Poland<U+2019>s Beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the [[Orava River|Orava]], which flows via the [[V<U+00E1>h]] and the [[Danube]] to the [[Black Sea]]. The eastern Beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the [[Dniester]] to the Black Sea.

Poland<U+2019>s rivers have been used since early times for navigation. The [[Viking]]s, for example, traveled up the Vistula and the Oder in their [[longship]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]] and in early modern times, when [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] was the breadbasket of Europe, the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the Vistula toward [[Gda<U+0144>sk]] and onward to eastern Europe took on great importance. For an overview of Polish rivers, see [[:Category:Rivers of Poland]].

===Geology===
[[Image:Dolina 5 Staw<U+00F3>w Polskich a6.jpg|thumb|right|Granite crags of the [[High Tatras]]]]

The geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of Europe and Africa over the past 60&nbsp;million years, on the one hand, and the [[Quaternary]] [[glaciation]]s of northern Europe, on the other. Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathians]]. The [[moraine]] landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of [[sand]] or [[loam]], while the [[ice-age]] river valleys of the south often contain [[loess]]. The [[Cracow-Cz<U+0119>stochowa Upland]], the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Krak<U+00F3>w-Cz<U+0119>stochowa Upland]] is one of the oldest mountain ranges on earth.

===Mountains and topography===
[[Image:Tatry Hala Gasienicowa.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tatra Mountains]].]]

Poland has 21 mountains over {{convert|2000|m|ft}} in elevation, all in the [[High Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the [[Western Tatras]], is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian range]]. In the High Tatras lies Poland<U+2019>s highest point, the northwestern peak of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft}} in elevation. At its foot lies the mountain lake, the [[Morskie Oko]]. The second highest mountain group in Poland is the [[Beskids]], whose highest peak is [[Babia G<U+00F3>ra]], at {{convert|1725|m|ft}}. The next highest mountain group is the [[Karkonosze]], whose highest point is [[<U+015A>nie<U+017C>ka]], at {{convert|1602|m|ft}}. Among the most beautiful mountains of Poland are the [[Bieszczady Mountains]] in the far southeast of Poland, whose highest point in Poland is [[Tarnica]], with an elevation of {{convert|1346|m|ft}}. Tourists also frequent the Gorce Mountains in [[Gorce National Park]], with elevations around {{convert|1300|m|ft}}, and the [[Pieniny]] in [[Pieniny National Park (Poland)|Pieniny National Park]], with elevations around {{convert|1000|m|ft}}. The lowest point in Poland&mdash;at {{convert|2|m|ft}} below sea level&mdash;is at Raczki Elbl<U+0105>skie, near [[Elbl<U+0105>g]] in the Vistula Delta. For a list of the most important mountain ranges of Poland, see the [[:Category:Mountain ranges of Poland]].

===Lakes===
[[Image:Kurtkowiec i czerwone.jpg|thumb|right|Kurtkowiec, [[oligotrophic lake]] in southeastern Poland.]]

With almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than one hectare (2.47 acres) each, Poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world. In Europe, only [[Finland]] has a greater density of lakes. The largest lakes, covering more than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi}}, are [[<U+015A>niardwy|Lake <U+015A>niardwy]] and [[Lake Mamry]] in [[Masuria]], as well as [[<U+0141>ebsko Lake|Lake <U+0141>ebsko]] and [[Drawsko Lake|Lake Drawsko]] in [[Pomerania]]. In addition to the lake districts in the north (in Masuria, Pomerania, [[Kashubia]], Lubuskie, and [[Greater Poland]]), there is also a large number of mountain lakes in the Tatras, of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area. The lake with the greatest depth&mdash;of more than {{convert|100|m|ft}}&mdash;is [[Ha<U+0144>cza|Lake Ha<U+0144>cza]] in the Wigry Lake District, east of Masuria in [[Podlaskie Voivodship]].

[[Image:J. goldap.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lake in [[Go<U+0142>dap]].]]
Among the first lakes whose shores were settled are those in the Greater Polish Lake District. The [[stilt house]] settlement of [[Biskupin]], occupied by more than one thousand residents, was founded before the seventh century BC by people of the [[Lusatian culture]]. The ancestors of today<U+2019>s Poles, the [[Polanie]], built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes. The legendary Prince [[Popiel]] is supposed to have ruled from [[Kruszwica]] on [[Gop<U+0142>o|Lake Gop<U+0142>o]]. The first historically documented ruler of Poland, Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], had his palace on an island in the Warta River in [[Pozna<U+0144>]].

For the most important lakes of Poland, see the [[:Category:Lakes of Poland]].

===The coast===
[[Image:Zatoka Pucka - Bay of Puck (8).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bay of Puck]] ''(Zatoka Pucka)'' in Poland.]]

The Polish Baltic coast is approximately {{convert|528|km|mi}} long and extends from [[<U+015A>winouj<U+015B>cie]] on the islands of [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]] in the west to [[Krynica Morska]] on the [[Vistula Spit]] in the east. For the most part, Poland has a smooth coastline, which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds from west to east. This continual [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former [[lagoon]]s, such as <U+0141>ebsko Lake in S<U+0142>owi<U+0144>ski National Park. The largest spits are [[Hel Peninsula]] and the Vistula Spit. The largest Polish Baltic island is Wolin. The largest port cities are [[Gdynia]], [[Gda<U+0144>sk]], [[Szczecin]], and <U+015A>winouj<U+015B>cie. The main coastal resorts are [[Sopot]], [[Mi<U+0119>dzyzdroje]], [[Ko<U+0142>obrzeg]], [[<U+0141>eba]], [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>awowo]], and the Hel Peninsula.

===The desert===
[[Image:Pustynia.bledowska23.jpg|thumb|left|[[B<U+0142><U+0119>d<U+00F3>w Desert]], the only desert in Poland]]

[[B<U+0142><U+0119>d<U+00F3>w Desert]] is a desert located in Southern Poland in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]] and stretches over the [[Zag<U+0142><U+0119>bie D<U+0105>browskie]] region. It has a total area of {{convert|32|km2|sqmi}}. It is the only desert located in Poland. It is one of only five natural deserts in Europe. It is the warmest desert that appears at this [[latitude]]. It was created thousands of years ago by a melting glacier. The specific geological structure has been of big importance. The average thickness of the sand layer is about {{convert|40|m|ft}}, with a maximum of {{convert|70|m|ft}}, which made the fast and deep drainage very easy. In recent years the desert has begun to shrink. The phenomenon of [[mirage]]s have been known to exist there.

===Land use===
[[Image:Gora Cisowa 03.jpg|thumb|right|The patchwork landscape of [[Masuria]]]]

[[:Category:Forests of Poland|Forests]] cover 28% of Poland<U+2019>s land area. More than half of the land is devoted to agriculture. While the total area under cultivation is declining, the remaining farmland is more intensively cultivated.

More than 1% of Poland<U+2019>s territory, {{convert|3145|km2|sqmi}}, is protected within 23 [[national parks]]. In this respect, Poland ranks first in Europe. Three more national parks are projected for [[Masuria]], the [[Cracow-Cz<U+0119>stochowa Upland]], and the eastern [[Beskids]]. Most [[List of National Parks of Poland|Polish national parks]] are located in the southern part of the country. In addition, [[wetlands]] along lakes and rivers in central Poland are legally protected, as are coastal areas in the north. There are also over 120 areas designated as [[Landscape Park (Poland)|landscape parks]], and numerous [[nature reserve]]s and other [[Protected areas of Poland|protected areas]].

===Flora and fauna===
[[Image:Wisent.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wisent]] in the [[Bia<U+0142>owie<U+017C>a Forest]]]]

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Poland belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Poland can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests and Carpathian montane conifer forests.
[[Image:WhiteStorkFamily.jpg|thumb|Family of [[White stork]], a national bird in Poland<ref>[http://storks.poland.pl/about_stork/index.htm Poland.pl - White Stork - About White Stork<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>]]

Many animals that have since died out in other parts of Europe still survive in Poland, such as the [[wisent]] in the [[ancient woodland]] of the [[Bia<U+0142>owie<U+017C>a Forest]] and in [[Podlachia]]. Other such species include the [[brown bear]] in Bia<U+0142>owie<U+017C>a, in the Tatras, and in the Beskids, the [[gray wolf]] and the [[Eurasian lynx]] in various forests, the [[moose]] in northern Poland, and the [[beaver]] in Masuria, Pomerania, and Podlachia. In the forests, one also encounters game animals, such as [[red deer]], [[roe deer]], and [[boar]]s. In eastern Poland there are a number of ancient woodlands, like Bia<U+0142>owie<U+017C>a, that have never been cleared by people. There are also large forested areas in the mountains, Masuria, Pomerania, and [[Lower Silesia]].

Poland is the most important breeding ground for European migratory birds. Out of all of the migratory birds who come to Europe for the summer, one quarter breed in Poland, particularly in the lake districts and the wetlands along the [[Biebrza]], the [[Narew]], and the [[Warta]], which are part of nature reserves or national parks. In Masuria, there are villages in which storks outnumber people.

===Climate===
The climate is mostly [[temperate]] throughout the country. The climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] in the north and west and becomes gradually warmer and [[Continental climate|continental]] as one moves south and east. Summers are generally warm, with average temperatures between {{convert|20|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} and {{convert|27|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}. Winters are cold, with average temperatures around {{convert|3|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in the northwest and {{convert|-8|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in the northeast. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] falls throughout the year, although, especially in the east; winter is drier than summer. The warmest region in Poland is [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]] located in Southern Poland where temperatures in the summer average between {{convert|23|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} and {{convert|30|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} but can go as high as {{convert|32|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} to {{convert|38|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} on some days in the warmest month of the year July. The warmest city in Poland is [[Tarn<U+00F3>w]]. The city is located in [[Lesser Poland]]. It is the hottest place in Poland all year round. The average temperatures being {{convert|30|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in the summer and {{convert|4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in the winter. Tarn<U+00F3>w also has the longest summer in Poland spreading from mid May to mid-September. It also has the shortest winter in Poland which often lasts from January to March, less than the regular three-month winter. The coldest region of Poland is in the Northeast in the [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]] near the border of [[Belarus]]. The climate is efficient due to cold fronts which come from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Siberia]]. The average temperature in the winter in Podlachian ranges from {{convert|-15|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} to {{convert|-4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}.

==Government==
{{main|Politics of Poland|Foreign relations of Poland|Military of Poland}}
[[Image:Lech Kaczy<U+0144>ski.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[President of the Republic of Poland|President of Poland]] [[Lech Kaczy<U+0144>ski]]]]
[[Image:Sejm RP.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Sejm building in [[Warsaw]]]]
Poland is a [[democracy]], with a President as a [[Head of State]], whose current [[Constitution of Poland|constitution]] dates from 1997. The government structure centres on the [[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]], led by a [[Prime Ministers of Poland|prime minister]]. The president appoints the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] according to the proposals of the prime minister, typically from the majority coalition in the [[Sejm]]. The [[Presidents of Poland|president]] is elected by popular vote every five years. The current president is [[Lech Kaczy<U+0144>ski]], the current prime minister is [[Donald Tusk]].

Polish voters elect a [[bicameral]] parliament consisting of a 460-member lower house ([[Sejm]]) and a 100-member Senate ([[Senate of Poland|Senat]]). The [[Sejm]] is elected under [[proportional representation]] according to the [[d'Hondt method]], a method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems. The Senate, on the other hand, is elected under a rare [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] [[bloc voting]] method where several candidates with the highest support are elected from each [[constituency]]. With the exception of ethnic minority parties, only candidates of [[Political parties in Poland|political parties]] receiving at least 5% of the total national vote can enter the Sejm. When sitting in joint session, members of the Sejm and Senate form the [[National Assembly of Poland|National Assembly]] (the ''Zgromadzenie Narodowe''). The National Assembly is formed on three occasions: when a new President takes the [[oath of office]]; when an indictment against the President of the Republic is brought to the [[State Tribunal of Poland|State Tribunal]] (''Trybuna<U+0142> Stanu''); and when a President's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health is declared. To date, only the first instance has occurred.

The [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] plays an important role in decision-making. Its major institutions include the [[Supreme Court of Poland]] (''S<U+0105>d Najwy<U+017C>szy''); the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland]] (''Naczelny S<U+0105>d Administracyjny''); the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland]] (''Trybuna<U+0142> Konstytucyjny''); and the [[State Tribunal of Poland]] (''Trybuna<U+0142> Stanu''). On the approval of the Senate, the Sejm also appoints the [[Polish Ombudsman|Ombudsman]] or the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection (''Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich'') for a five-year term. The Ombudsman has the duty of guarding the observance and implementation of the rights and liberties of Polish [[Citizenship|citizens]] and [[Residency (domicile)|residents]], of the law and of principles of community life and social justice.

===Administrative divisions===
{{details|Administrative division of Poland}}
Poland's current [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}}  for Opole Voivodeship to more than {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed [[voivode]] (governor), an elected regional assembly (''[[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]'') and an executive elected by that assembly.

The voivodeships are subdivided into ''[[powiat]]s'' (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into ''[[gmina]]s'' (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both ''gmina'' and ''powiat''. Poland currently has 16 voivodeships, 379 powiats (including 65 cities with ''powiat'' status), and 2,478 ''gminas''.

{{main|Polish Armed Forces}}
The Polish armed forces are composed of four branches: [[Polish Land Forces|Land Forces]] (''Wojska L<U+0105>dowe''), [[Polish Navy|Navy]] (''Marynarka Wojenna''), [[Polish Air Force|Air Force]] (''Si<U+0142>y Powietrzne'') and [[Polish Special Forces|Special Forces]] (''Wojska Specjalne'').

The most important mission of the Armed Forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad.<ref name="mil">{{pl icon}} {{cite web  |author = |url = http://www.wp.mil.pl/pliki/File/zalaczniki_do_stron/SBN_RP.pdf |format=PDF|title = Strategia Bezpiecze<U+0144>stwa Narodowego RP |work = www.wp.mil.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2008-09-26}}</ref> Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with [[NATO]] and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernization and reorganization of its military.<ref name="mil" /> Polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its NATO partners. Poland is also playing an increasing role as a peacekeeping power through various [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions.<ref name="mil" />

==Demographics==
{{seesubarticle|Demographics of Poland}}
Poland, with 38,116,000 inhabitants,<ref name="CSO_2008"/> has the eighth-largest population in Europe and the sixth-largest in the [[European Union]]. It has a population density of 122 inhabitants per square kilometer (328 per square mile).

[[Image:Gda<U+0144>sk kamienice przy D<U+0142>ugim Targu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gda<U+0144>sk]], Long Market]]
[[Image:Warsaw22hk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Warsaw]] downtown]]

Poland historically contained [[Historical demographics of Poland|many languages, cultures and religions]] on its soil. The country had a particularly [[History of Polish Jews|large Jewish population]] prior to the [[Second World War]], when the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Holocaust]] caused Poland's [[Jewish]] population, estimated at 3&nbsp;million before the war, to drop to just 300,000. The outcome of the war, particularly the [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|westward shift of Poland's borders]] to the area between the [[Curzon line]] and the [[Oder-Neisse line]], coupled with post-war [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|expulsion of minorities]], significantly reduced the country's ethnic diversity.
According to the [[Polish census of 2002|2002 census]], 36,983,700 people, or 96.74% of the population, consider themselves [[Poles|Polish]], while 471,500 (1.23%) declared another nationality, and 774,900 (2.03%) did not declare any nationality. The largest minority nationalities and ethnic groups in Poland are [[Silesians]], [[Kashubians]], [[German minority in Poland|Germans]] (152,897 according to the census, most in [[Opole Voivodeship]]), [[Belarusians]] (c. 49,000), [[Ukrainians]] (c. 30,000), [[Lithuanians]], [[Russians]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jew]]s, [[Lemkos]], [[Slovaks]], [[Czechs]], and [[Lipka Tatars|Tatars]]. Among foreign citizens, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] are the largest ethnic group, followed by [[Greeks]] and [[Armenians]].

[[Image:Krakow rynek 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cracow]], [[Main Market Square, Krak<U+00F3>w|Main Market Square]]]]

The [[Polish language]], a member of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] branch of the [[Slavic languages]], functions as the [[official language]] of Poland. Until recent decades [[Russian language|Russian]] was commonly learned as a second language, but now has been replaced by English and German as the most common second languages studied and spoken.

In recent years, Poland's population has decreased because of an increase in emigration and a sharp drop in the birth rate. Since Poland's accession to the [[European Union]], a significant number of Poles have emigrated to Western European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in search of work. Some organizations have stated that Polish emigration is primarily due to Poland's high [[unemployment rate]] (10.5% in 2007), with Poles searching for better work opportunities abroad. In April 2007, the Polish population of the United Kingdom had risen to approximately 300,000 and estimates place the Polish population in Ireland at 65,000. However, some sources claim that the number of Polish citizens who emigrated to the UK after 2004 is as high as 2 million. <ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-384121/UK-lets-Poles-Warsaw.html UK lets in more Poles than there are in Warsaw]</ref>

Polish minorities are still present in the neighboring countries of [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Lithuania]], as well as in other countries (see [[Poles]] for population numbers). Altogether, the number of ethnic Poles living abroad is estimated to be around 20&nbsp;million. The largest number of [[Polonia|Poles outside of Poland]] can be found in the United States.

===Urban Areas===
The largest [[metropolitan area]]s in Poland are the [[Upper Silesian Coal Basin]] centred on [[Katowice]] (3.5 million inhabitants); the capital, [[Warsaw]] (3 million); [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] and [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]] (each 1.3 million); the [[Tricity]] of [[Gda<U+0144>sk]]-[[Sopot]]-[[Gdynia]] in the Vistula delta (1.1 million); [[Pozna<U+0144>]] (900,000); [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]] (900,000); and [[Szczecin]] (700,000).

==Economy==
{{seesubarticle|Economy of Poland}}
[[Image:Warsaw7ob.jpg|thumb|right|Financial centre of [[Warsaw]]]]

Poland is considered to have one of the healthiest economies of the post-communist countries, with GDP growing by 6.1% in 2006.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/09/24/poland-electrabel-vattenfall-markets-equity-cx_vr_0924markets10.html Tapping Into Polish Power - Forbes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Since the [[fall of communism]], Poland has steadfastly pursued a policy of [[neoliberalism|liberalising]] the economy and today stands out as a successful example of the transition from a [[state-directed economy]] to a primarily [[privately owned]] [[market economy]].

The [[Privatization|privatisation]] of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms have allowed the development of an aggressive private sector. As a consequence, [[consumer rights]] organizations have also appeared<!--such as...?-->. Restructuring and privatisation of "sensitive sectors" such as [[coal]], [[steel]], [[railway]]s, and energy has been continuing since 1990. Between 2007 and 2010, the government plans to float twenty public companies on the [[Polish stock market]], including parts of the coal industry. To date (2007), the biggest privatisations have been the sale of the national [[Telecommunication|telecoms]] firm [[Telekomunikacja Polska]] to [[France Telecom]] in 2000, and an issue of 30% of the shares in Poland's largest bank, [[PKO Bank Polski]], on the Polish stockmarket in 2004.

Poland has a large number of private farms in its [[Agriculture|agricultural]] sector, with the potential to become a leading producer of food in the European Union. Structural reforms in [[health care]], [[education]], the [[pension]] system, and state administration have resulted in larger-than-expected fiscal pressures. Warsaw leads [[Central Europe]] in foreign investment.<ref>"[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/archiwum.phtml/5473/ Poland in the Lead]", ''The Warsaw Voice'', September 2002.

In 2004, GDP growth equaled 5.4%, in 2005 3.3% and in 2006 6.2%. For 2007, the government has set a target for GDP growth at 6.5 to 7.0%.<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite web  |author= |url=http://www.paiz.gov.pl/nowosci/?id_news=1297&lang_id=12 |title= Polish Information and Foreign Investment Agency.

Although the Polish economy is currently undergoing [[economic development]], there are many challenges ahead. The most notable task on the horizon is the preparation of the economy (through continuing deep structural reforms) to allow Poland to meet the strict economic criteria for entry into the [[Euro|European Single Currency]] (Euro). According to the minister of finance Jacek Rostowski, Poland is likely to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|ERM]] in 2009 and adopt the euro in 2012<ref>Gazeta Wyborcza, "[http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80353,5016274.html Szejnfeld: Wej<U+015B>cie do strefy euro korzystne dla przedsi<U+0119>biorc<U+00F3>w]</ref> or 2013.<ref>Jan Cienski, "[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/fcbe4ce0-3b8a-11dc-8002-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8.html Poland Alters Stance on Euro]</ref> Some businesses may already accept the euro as payment.

==Science, technology and education==
{{seesubarticle2|Polish science and technology|Education in Poland}}

===Education===
[[Image:Collegium Maius 07.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Collegium Maius]]'' is the oldest building of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]].]]

The education of Polish society was a goal of rulers as early as the 12th century, and Poland soon became one of the most educated European countries. The library catalogue of the Cathedral Chapter of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] dating back to 1110 shows that already in the early 12th century Polish intellectuals had access to the European literature. In 1364, in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], the [[Jagiellonian University]], founded by King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]], became one of Europe's great early universities. In 1773 King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]] established his [[Commission on National Education]] (''Komisja Edukacji Narodowej''), the world's first state ministry of education.

Today Poland has more than a hundred [[tertiary education]] institutions; traditional [[universities]] to be found in its major cities of [[Bia<U+0142>ystok]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Gda<U+0144>sk]], [[Katowice]], [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], [[Lublin]], [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], [[Olsztyn]], [[Opole]], [[Pozna<U+0144>]], [[Rzesz<U+00F3>w]], [[Szczecin]], [[Toru<U+0144>]], [[Warsaw]], [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]] and [[Zielona G<U+00F3>ra]] as well as technical, medical, economic institutions elsewhere, employing around 61,000 workers. There are also around 300 research and development institutes, with about 10,000 more researchers. In total, there are around 91,000 scientists in Poland today.

According to Frost & Sullivan's Country Industry Forecast the country is becoming an interesting location for research and development investments.<ref name="autogenerated2">Newswire [http://www.newswiretoday.com/news/26490/ Poland Emerges as the European R&D Hub Despite Favorable Conditions in Asia Pacific]</ref> Multinational companies such as: ABB, Delphi, GlaxoSmithKline, Google, Hewlett<U+2013>Packard, IBM, Intel, LG Electronics and Microsoft have set up R&D centres in Poland.

According to KPMG report<ref>KPMG, [http://www.paiz.gov.pl/files/?id_plik=7513 Why Poland?]</ref> 80% of Poland's current investors are contented with their choice and willing to reinvest. In 2006, Intel decided to double the number of employees in its R&D centre.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks Poland's education as the 23rd best in the world, being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average.<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite web  |author= |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |format=PDF|title=Range of rank on PISA 2006 science scale|work= www.oecd.org |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref>
