She was born in [[Stockton, California]], to Shigemi and Ted Mirikitani, who were Nisei farmers in [[San Joaquin County]].<ref name=madsen2005/> During [[World War II]], she was interned along with her family at the [[Rohwer War Relocation Center]] in [[Arkansas]].<ref name=nam2001/> Following the war, the Mirikitani family moved to [[Chicago]]. After her parents were divorced, Janice was brought back to a chicken farm at [[Petaluma, California]], with her mother, where they would be near the remainder of their family. During the time that followed, Janice Mirikitani became the victim of sexual molestation up to the age of sixteen, and was saved from suicide only by the love and care of her grandmother. She would later speak of the pain of her incestuous abuse through her poetry.<ref name=nimura2002/>

Janice Mirikitani attended [[UCLA]], earning a Bachelor of Arts degree. During this time, she struggled with her ethnic identity, which she would later portray through her poetry. After gaining her teaching credentials, she taught in the Contra Costa School District for a year. She worked at [[Glide Memorial Church]] in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin district]] of [[San Francisco]] as an administrative assistant.<ref name=nimura2002/>

From her first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1966, Janice Mirikitani gave birth to her daughter, Tianne Tsukiko Miller, in 1967. Janice Mirikitani then entered graduate school for creative writing at [[San Francisco State University]], but later discontinued her
studies.  After participating in the Asian American Political Alliance, she joined Third World Communications and became the editor of ''Aion'', the
first Asian American literary magazine, from 1970&ndash;71. She edited two anthologies for Third World Communications: ''Third World Women'' (1972) and ''Time to Greez! Incantations from the Third World'' (1975). Mirikitani then became project director for ''Ayumi: A Japanese American Anthology'' (1980).<ref name=nimura2002/>

After two years of activism for Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in 1969 she became the program director. In 1982 Mirikitani was married to Reverend [[Cecil Williams]]. That same year she was chosen as the president of the
Glide Foundation, where she was responsible for fund raising and budget oversight. In 2000, she was named the second poet laureate for the city of San Francisco. The [[California State Assembly]] named her Woman of the Year for the 17th Assembly District.<ref name=nam2001/><ref name=niiya1993/><ref name=nelson2005/>
