''''' Yasui v. United States''''', [[Case citation|320 U.S. 115]] ([[1943]]){{ref|citation}} was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that the application of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', both decided on [[June 21]] [[1943]], the court affirmed the conviction of U.S. born [[Minoru Yasui]]. The court remanded the case to the district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese [[consulate]].

==Background==
On [[September 1]] [[1939]], [[Germany]] invaded neighboring [[Poland]], starting [[World War II]]. After two years of combat neutrality, the [[United States]] was drawn into the war as an active participant after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on [[December 7]] [[1941]]. U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] responded to fears of a [[fifth column]] composed of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment|Japanese-Americans]] by issuing [[Executive Order 9066]] on [[February 19]] [[1942]].<ref name=order>[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=74&page=transcript Transcript of Executive Order 9066: Resulting in the Relocation of Japanese (1942).] Our Documents. Retrieved on [[November 19]] [[2007]].</ref> This [[executive order]] authorized the military to create zones of exclusion, which were then used to relocate predominantly those of Japanese heritage from the [[West Coast]] to [[Internment|internment camps]] inland. On [[March 23]] [[1942]], General [[John L. DeWitt]], commander of the Western Defense Command, set restrictions on aliens and Japanese-Americans including a curfew from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am.<ref>"New Curfew for Japanese Starts Friday," ''Oakland Tribune'', March 24, 1942, p1 </ref><ref name=timeline>[http://www.janm.org/projects/clasc/chronology.htm Chronolgy of World War II Incarceration.] Japanese American National Museum.

[[Minoru Yasui]] was born in 1916 in [[Hood River, Oregon]], where he graduated from high school in 1933.<ref name=bio>[http://bss.sfsu.edu/internment/yasui_bio.html Japanese American Internment Curriculum: Minoru Yasui.]] San Francisco State University.

On [[June 12]] [[1942]], judge [[James Alger Fee]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon]] began presiding over the non-jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the curfew to make it to court.<ref name=war/> The trial was held at the [[Gus J.
