The '''Battle of Mauropotamos''' ({{lang-el|<U+039C><U+03AC><U+03C7><U+03B7> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+1FE6> <U+039C><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C5>}}) was fought in 844, between the armies of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], at Mauropotamos (either in northern [[Bithynia]] or in [[Cappadocia]]). After a failed Byzantine attempt to recover the [[Emirate of Crete]] in the previous year, the Abbasids launched a raid into [[Asia Minor]]. The Byzantine regent, [[Theoktistos]], headed the army that went to meet the invasion but was heavily defeated, and many of his officers defected to the [[Arabs]]. Internal unrest prevented the Abbasids from exploiting their victory, however. A truce and a prisoner exchange were consequently agreed in 845, followed by a six-year cessation of hostilities, as both powers focused their attention elsewhere.

==Background==
Following the [[Triumph of Orthodoxy|restoration]] of the veneration of [[icon]]s in March 843, the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s government, headed by the Empress-regent [[Theodora the Armenian|Theodora]] and the ''[[logothetes]]'' [[Theoktistos]], embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological foe, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability that the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm controversy]] brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims.<ref name="EHW1">{{harvnb|Kiapidou|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=7925&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_1 Chapter 1]}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=446<U+2013>447}}.</ref>

The first such campaign, an attempted reconquest of the [[Emirate of Crete]] led by Theoktistos in person, made initial gains, but ultimately ended in disaster. After scoring a victory over the Arabs in Crete, Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother [[Bardas]]. Theoktistos hurried back to [[Constantinople]], where he discovered that the rumour was false, but in his absence, the Byzantine army in Crete was routed by the Arabs.<ref>{{harvnb|Vasiliev|1935|pp=194<U+2013>195}}.</ref><ref name="Treadgold447">{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=447}}.</ref> 

==Battle==
In 844, according to Byzantine sources, Theoktistos learned of an Arab invasion of Byzantine [[Asia Minor]], led by a certain 'Amr, probably the semi-autonomous [[emir]] of [[Malatya]], [[Umar al-Aqta]]. The Arab sources do not make explicit mention of this campaign. The Russian scholar [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]], however, identified it with an expedition recorded in the poems of [[Abu Tammam]] and [[Buhturi]], which was led by general Abu Sa'id and took place during the regency of Theodora. Umar al-Aqta's participation is likely, as he often aided the Abbasids in their raids against the Byzantines.<ref name="EHW1"/><ref>{{harvnb|Vasiliev|1935|pp=195<U+2013>196}}.</ref> According to Arab accounts, the troops led by Abu Sa'id comprised men from the border emirates of Qaliqala ([[Erzurum]]) and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]]. The Arab forces united at Ardandun (possibly the border fort of Rhodandos) before raiding through the Byzantine [[thema|themes]] of [[Cappadocia (theme)|Cappadocia]], [[Anatolikon]], [[Boukellarion]], and [[Opsikion]]. Sa'id's troops sacked [[Dorylaion]] and even reached the shore of the [[Bosporus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Vasiliev|1935|pp=399<U+2013>404}}.</ref>

Theoktistos led the Byzantine army in against the invaders, but was heavily defeated at Mauropotamos ("Black River"). The location of the latter, if indeed it is a river and not a simple toponym, is disputed; it was most likely a tributary of the [[Sangarius]] in [[Bithynia]] or of the [[Halys River|Halys]] in Cappadocia. Not only did the Byzantines suffer heavy casualties, but many senior Byzantine officials defected to the Arabs.<ref>{{harvnb|Vasiliev|1935|pp=196<U+2013>198}}.</ref><ref name="EHW2">{{harvnb|Kiapidou|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=7925&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_2 Chapter 2]}}.</ref> Theoktistos returned to Constantinople, where he blamed Bardas for the recent defeats and had him exiled from the capital.<ref name="Treadgold447"/><ref>{{harvnb|Vasiliev|1935|p=198}}.</ref><ref name="EHW3">{{harvnb|Kiapidou|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=7925&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_3 Chapter 3]}}.</ref>

==Aftermath==
The Abbasids were unable to exploit their success due to the internal instability of the Caliphate. Likewise, the Byzantines preferred to focus their strength against the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|ongoing conquest]] of [[Sicily]] by the [[Aghlabids]]. Thus, a Byzantine embassy was sent to [[Baghdad]] in 845, which was warmly received. The Abbasids reciprocated with an embassy to Constantinople, where the two states agreed on a truce and a prisoner exchange, which was held at the river [[Lamos (Cilicia)|Lamos]] on 16 September 845. A winter raid by the Arab governor of Tarsus shortly after failed disastrously, after which the Arab-Byzantine frontier remained quiet for six years.<ref name="EHW3"/><ref>{{harvnb|Vasiliev|1935|pp=198<U+2013>204}}; {{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=447<U+2013>449}}.</ref>
