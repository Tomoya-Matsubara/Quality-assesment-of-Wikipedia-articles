'''USS ''Moonstone'' (PYc-9)''' was a [[patrol boat|coastal patrol yacht]] in the service of the [[United States Navy]]. She was built in 1929 as ''Nancy Baker'' by [[Germaniawerft]] in [[Kiel]], [[Germany]], later renamed ''Mona'', and subsequently acquired by the Navy as the ''Lone Star'' on [[February 10]] [[1941]]. Renamed ''Moonstone'' and designated PYc-9, she was converted for Navy service in Jacksonville, Florida, and commissioned on [[April 10]] [[1941]]. She was named for the [[gemstone]] [[moonstone]].

On [[May 2]] [[1941]] ''Moonstone'' sailed for patrol duty with the [[Panama]]nian Sea Frontier. She later sailed to [[Ecuador]] on [[January 2]] [[1943]] to aid in training that country's navy. In March 1943 she sailed to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to prepare for permanent transfer to Ecuador. On her return at [[Balboa]], Panama in July 1943, cracks were discovered in the cylinder blocks of her engine, and she was sent north for repairs. On [[October 16]] [[1943]], off the mouth of [[Indian River (Delaware)|Indian River]], [[Delaware Capes]] , she collided with [[USS Greer (DD-145)|USS ''Greer'']] and sank immediately. All but one of ''Moonstone's'' complement survived. She was struck from the Naval Register on [[October 26]] [[1943]].

Her wreck lies 35 miles (56 km) southeast of [[Cape May, New Jersey]], in 130 feet of water.
