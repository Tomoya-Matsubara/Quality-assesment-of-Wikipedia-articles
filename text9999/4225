It had four to six long horns extending from its [[neck frill]], a smaller horn on each of its cheeks, and a single horn protruding from its nose, which may have been up to 60&nbsp;centimetres (2&nbsp;ft) long and 15&nbsp;centimetres (6&nbsp;in) wide. The function or functions of the horns and frills have been debated for many years.

''Styracosaurus'' was a relatively large dinosaur, reaching lengths of 5.5&nbsp;metres (18&nbsp;ft) and weighing nearly 3&nbsp;[[ton]]s. It stood about 1.8&nbsp;meters (6&nbsp;ft) tall. ''Styracosaurus'' possessed four short legs and a bulky body. Its tail was rather short. The skull had a beak and shearing cheek teeth arranged in continuous dental batteries, suggesting that the animal sliced up plants. Like other ceratopsians, this dinosaur may have been a [[herd animal]], traveling in large groups, as suggested by [[bone bed|bonebed]]s.

Named by [[Lawrence Lambe]] in 1913, ''Styracosaurus'' is a member of the [[Centrosaurinae]]. One [[species]], ''S. albertensis'', is currently assigned to ''Styracosaurus''. Other species assigned to the genus have since been reassigned elsewhere.

==Description==

Aside from the large nasal horn and four long frill spikes, the cranial ornamentation was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the [[anatomical terms of location|posterior]] margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in ''Centrosaurus''. Others had less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. Others had much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults.<ref name=RHR07/> Like most ceratopsids, ''Styracosaurus'' had large [[fenestrae]] (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.

The bulky body of ''Styracosaurus'' resembled that of a [[rhinoceros]]. It had powerful shoulders which may have been useful in intraspecies combat. ''Styracosaurus'' had a relatively short tail. Each toe bore a hooflike [[ungual]] which was sheathed in horn.<ref name="Lambert"/>

Various limb positions have been proposed for ''Styracosaurus'' and ceratopsids in general, including forelegs which were held underneath the body, or, alternatively, held in a sprawling position.

Goodwin and colleagues proposed in 1992 that ''Styracosaurus'' was part of the lineage leading to ''[[Einiosaurus]]'', ''[[Achelousaurus]]'' and ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''.  This was based on a series of fossil skulls from the [[Two Medicine Formation]] of Montana .<ref name="Varricchio.et.al1992">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/358059a0 | last1 = Goodwin | first1 = M.J | last2 = Varricchio | first2 = D.J. | last3 = Horner | first3 = J.R. | year = 1992 | title = Marine transgressions and the evolution of Cretaceous dinosaurs | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 358 | issue = 6381| pages = 59<U+2013>61 }}</ref> The position of ''Styracosaurus'' in this lineage is now equivocal, as the remains that were thought to represent ''Styracosaurus'' have been transferred to the genus ''[[Rubeosaurus]]''.<ref name=AMJH10/>

===Origins===
The evolutionary origins of ''Styracosaurus'' were not understood for many years because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of ''[[Protoceratops]]'', in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships,<ref name="Dodson2">Dodson, P. (1996). ''The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History''. Princeton University Press: Princeton, New Jersey, p. 244. ISBN 0-691-02882-6.</ref> but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including ''[[Zuniceratops]]'', the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and ''[[Yinlong]]'', the first known [[Jurassic]] ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of ''Styracosaurus'' may have looked like. These new discoveries have been important in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, and suggest that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, with the appearance of true horned ceratopsians occurring by the beginning of the late Cretaceous in North America.<ref name ="Dino2"/>

==Discoveries and species==
The first [[fossil]] remains of ''Styracosaurus'' were collected in [[Alberta]], Canada by [[Charles Mortram Sternberg|C.M. Sternberg]] (from an area now known as [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], in a [[geological formation|formation]] now called the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]) and named by [[Lawrence Lambe]] in 1913. This quarry was revisited in 1935 by a [[Royal Ontario Museum]] crew who found the missing lower jaws and most of the skeleton. These fossils indicate that ''S. albertensis'' was around 5.5 to 5.8&nbsp;meters in length and stood about 1.65&nbsp;meters high at the hips.<ref name="Dodson"/> An unusual feature of this first skull is that the smallest frill spike on the left side is partially overlapped at its base by the next spike. It appears that the frill suffered a break at this point in life and was shortened by about 6&nbsp;centimeters (2&nbsp;in). The normal shape of this area is unknown because the corresponding area of the right side of the frill was not recovered.<ref name=RHR07/>
[[File:Styracosaurus skeleton.jpg|thumb|''Styracosaurus'' "parksi" skeleton, specimen AM5372]]
[[Barnum Brown]] and crew, working for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, collected a nearly complete articulated skeleton with a partial skull in 1915. These fossils were also found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, near [[Steveville, Alberta|Steveville]], Alberta. Brown and [[Erich Maren Schlaikjer]] compared the finds, and, though they allowed that both specimens were from the same general locality and geological formation, they considered the specimen sufficiently distinct from the [[holotype]] to warrant erecting a new species, and described the fossils as ''Styracosaurus parksi'', named in honor of [[William Parks (paleontologist)|William Parks]].<ref name="Brown">{{cite journal| last = Brown| first = Barnum| authorlink =| coauthors = Erich Maren Schlaikjer| title = The skeleton of ''Styracosaurus'' with the description of a new species| journal = American Museum novitates| volume = no. 955| pages = 12| publisher = New York City : The American Museum of Natural History| year = 1937| url = http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/2191| accessdate =2007-03-29}}</ref> Among the differences between the specimens cited by Brown and Schlaikjer were a [[jugal|cheekbone]] quite different from that of ''S. albertensis'', and smaller [[tail]] [[vertebra]]e. ''S. parksi'' also had a more robust jaw, a shorter [[dentary]], and the frill differed in shape from that of the type species.<ref name="Brown"/> However, much of the skull consisted of plaster reconstruction, and the original 1937 paper did not illustrate the actual skull bones.<ref name="Dodson"/> It is now accepted as a specimen of ''S. albertensis''.<ref name=RHR07/><ref name=Dino2/>

In the summer of 2006, [[Darren Tanke]] of the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]] in [[Drumheller, Alberta|Drumheller]], Alberta relocated the long lost ''S. parksi'' site.<ref name=RHR07/> Pieces of the skull, evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, were found in the quarry. These were collected and it is hoped more pieces will be found, perhaps enough to warrant a redescription of the skull and test whether ''S. albertensis'' and ''S. parksi'' are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial ''Styracosaurus'' skulls.<ref name=EG05/> At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed ''Styracosaurus'' bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous pieces of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill pieces.<ref name=RHR07/>

A third species, ''S. ovatus'', from the [[Two Medicine Formation]] of [[Montana]], was described by [[Charles W. Gilmore|Gilmore]] in 1930. The fossil material is limited, with the best being a portion of the [[parietal bone]] of the frill, but one unusual feature is that the pair of spikes closest to the midline converge towards the midline, rather than away from it as in ''S. albertensis''. There also may only have been two sets of spikes on each side of the frill, instead of three. The spikes are much shorter than in ''S. albertensis'', with the longest only 295&nbsp;millimeters (11.6&nbsp;in) long.<ref name="Gilmore1930">{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Charles W. |authorlink=Charles W.

Several other species which were assigned to ''Styracosaurus'' have since been assigned to other genera. ''S. sphenocerus'', described by [[Edward Drinker Cope]] in 1890 as a species of ''[[Monoclonius]]'' and based on a [[nasal bone]] with a broken ''Styracosaurus''-like straight nose horn, was attributed to ''Styracosaurus'' in 1915.<ref name="Lambe">{{cite journal|last=Lambe|first=L.

''Styracosaurus'' and other horned dinosaurs are often depicted in popular culture as [[herd]] animals.

''Styracosaurus'' is known from a higher position in the formation (relating specifically to its own genus) than the closely related ''Centrosaurus'', suggesting that ''Styracosaurus'' displaced ''Centrosaurus'' as the environment changed over time and/or dimension.<ref name="RE05"/>

===Dentition and diet===
Styracosaurs were [[herbivore|herbivorous]] dinosaurs; they probably fed mostly on low growth because of the position of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller [[plant]]s with their horns, [[beak]], and bulk.<ref name ="Dino2"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tait | first1 = J. | last2 = Brown | first2 = B. | year = 1928 | title = How the Ceratopsia carried and used their head | url = | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 13<U+2013>23 }}</ref> The [[jaw]]s were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.<ref name="Ostrom66">{{cite journal|author=Ostrom, J.

Ceratopsid teeth, including those of ''Styracosaurus'', were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike [[hadrosaurid]]s, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind.<ref name="Dino2"/> Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like ''Styracosaurus'' ate [[Arecaceae|palms]] and [[cycad]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weishampel | first1 = D.

===Horns and frill===
[[File:Styracosaurus.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the AM5372 skull, [[American Museum of Natural History]].]]
The large nasal horns and frills of ''Styracosaurus'' are among the most distinctive facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered.

Early in the 20th century, paleontologist [[R. S. Lull]] proposed that the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles.<ref name=RSL08>{{cite journal| last =Lull| first=R.S. | authorlink=R. S.

It was long believed that ceratopsians like ''Styracosaurus'' used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study found no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, there is no evidence of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone [[resorption]], or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.<ref name="TF06">Tanke, D. H, and Farke, A. A. (2006).

However, a newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions in ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and showed that these were consistent with ''Triceratops'' using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in ''Centrosaurus'' may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head;<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farke | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Wolff | first2 = E.D.S. | last3 = Tanke | first3 = D.H. | author-separator =, | last4 = Sereno | author-name-separator=  | first4 = Paul| year = 2009 | title = Evidence of Combat in ''Triceratops'' | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = e4252 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004252 | editor1-last = Sereno | editor1-first = Paul }}</ref> as ''Centrosaurus'' was more closely related to ''Styracosaurus'' and both genera had long nasal horns, the results for this genus would be more applicable for ''Styracosaurus''. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/01/dinofight/ |title=Scars Reveal How Triceratops Fought <U+2013> |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>

The large frill on ''Styracosaurus'' and related genera also may have helped to increase body area to [[thermoregulation|regulate body temperature]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wheeler, P.E.|year=1978|title=Elaborate CNS cooling structures in large dinosaurs|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|issue= 5679|pages=441<U+2013>443|doi=10.1038/275441a0|volume=275|pmid=692723}}</ref> like the ears of the modern [[elephant]].

Because of the distinctive frill and horns of ''Styracosaurus'', depictions of these animals are easily recognizable. The spines, hooks, and horns attached to the head of this dinosaur sparked the imagination of filmmakers during the earliest days of motion pictures, and this has led to its appearance in films ever since. Notable among them are: ''[[The Son of Kong]]'' (1933), where a ''Styracosaurus'' battles the movie's heroes;<ref name="Erickson">{{cite web| last =Erickson| first =G. | authorlink =| coauthors =| title =DVD Savant Review: ''The Son of Kong''| publisher =DVD Talk.com| year =2005| url =http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s1827son.html| accessdate =2007-04-24}}</ref> ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969), where ''Styracosaurus'' is pitted against a carnivorous dinosaur;<ref name="Perez">{{cite web| last =Perez| first =D.| title =The Styracosaurus 1969| publisher =The Seventh Voyage.com| year =2006| url =http://theseventhvoyage.com/Styracosaurus.htm| accessdate =2007-04-23}}</ref>''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'' (1975) where two animals are shelled by a German U-boat; and Disney's [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'' (2000), where an [[anthropomorphic]] ''Styracosaurus'' named Eema has a pet ''[[Ankylosaurus]]''.<ref name="Kobak">{{cite web| last =Kobak| first =S.| title =Dinosaur| publisher =Films on Disc|year=2002 |url=http://www.filmsondisc.com/dvdpages/dinosaur_dvd_review.htm| accessdate =2007-04-23}}</ref> The genus also appeared in the novel of ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', in the list of dinosaurs present in the park, but was not seen in the film adaptation.

On the [[television|small screen]], ''Styracosaurus'' has appeared in many cartoons and anime, including ''[[Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger]]'' (''[[Power Rangers: Dino Thunder]]''), ''[[Dinosaur King]]'', ''[[Dinozaurs]]'', ''[[DinoSquad]]'', ''[[Dino-Riders]]'', ''[[Dinosaucers]]'',<ref name="Tvcom">{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Dinosaucers Cast and Crew| work =| publisher =TV.com| year =2007| url =http://www.tv.com/dinosaucers/show/9208/cast.html| accessdate =2007-04-28}}</ref> and ''[[Zoids]]''.<ref name="ZT">{{cite web| title =Red Horn| work =Zoids Tribute| publisher =Mopock.com| year =2001| url =http://mopock.com/ZOIDS/photos/RedHorn.html| accessdate =2007-04-28}}</ref> ''Styracosaurus'' has also been featured in various video games, including the popular ''[[Jurassic Park video games|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Turok (series)|Turok]]'', ''[[Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals|Zoo Tycoon]]'', and ''[[Banjo-Tooie|Banjo-Kazooie]]'' game franchises.
