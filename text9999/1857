The '''Hitachi Magic Wand''' (also known as the '''Original Magic Wand''') is an electrical, [[Mains electricity|mains-powered]] vibrating massager, manufactured by the Japanese company [[Hitachi]] for relieving tension and relaxing sore muscles. The device is well known for its use as a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], a [[masturbation]] aid for women. The wand is {{convert|12|inch|cm}} long and weighs {{convert|1.2|lb|g}}. Stimulation is provided by its rubberised {{convert|2.5|inch}} head. Without attachments, the device functions effectively as a [[clitoral vibrator]] and is able to bring women to [[clitoral orgasm]]. Because of its popularity as a sex toy, aftermarket attachments designed to excite the [[clitoris]], allow women to feel vibrations deeper into the [[vagina]], and focus vibrations on the [[G-spot]] have been produced.

Hitachi listed the device for business in the United States in 1968. Its use as a vibrator was popularized by [[Sex education|sex educator]] [[Betty Dodson]] in masturbation courses for women. In 2000, Hitachi had a conflict with its U.S. distributor and briefly stopped selling the device until it reached a new deal with distributor [[Vibratex]]. The Magic Wand briefly sold out after featuring in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sex and the City]]''. Hitachi decided to cease production of the device in 2013 because of concerns about having its name attached to a sex toy. Vibratex persuaded the company to continue manufacturing it under the name "Original Magic Wand", omitting the name Hitachi.

Academics researched use of the Magic Wand for treatment of chronic [[anorgasmia]]{{mdash}}a [[sexual dysfunction]] in which a person cannot achieve orgasm{{mdash}}and other sexual problems, including [[female sexual arousal disorder]]. The ''[[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]]'' published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Hitachi HV 250 massager to be the most efficient option to address problems achieving orgasm. In 2008, ''[[The Scientific World Journal]]'' published research that found over 93% of a group of 465 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in multiple applications, including articles published in ''[[Dermatology Online Journal]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Physiology]]'', ''[[Experimental Brain Research]]'', ''[[Neuroscience Letters]]'', and ''[[Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing]]''.

Sex shop [[Good Vibrations (sex shop)|Good Vibrations]] called the Magic Wand "the Cadillac of vibrators". Counselors [[Ruth Westheimer]] and [[Laura Berman]] recommended the device to women, and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine reported that the Hitachi Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists. ''[[Mobile Magazine]]'' announced in its July 2005 issue that readers had voted the Hitachi Magic Wand "the No. 1 greatest gadget of all time". In 2006, Melinda Gallagher and Emily Kramer, the founders of women's entertainment company CAKE, awarded the device the Best Vibrator Award in their book ''A Piece of Cake''. [[Tanya Wexler]]'s film ''[[Hysteria (2011 film)|Hysteria]]'' featured the device while showing the evolution of the vibrator. ''[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]'' recommended the device in its 2014 primer on sex toys. ''[[Engadget]]'' called the Magic Wand "the most recognizable sex toy on Earth".<ref name="christophertrout" />

===Women's masturbation education===
The Magic Wand has found great commercial success as a vibrator, a masturbation aid for women.<ref name="christophertrout" /><ref name="westheimer" /> Its popularity for this purpose is associated with the American artist and [[sex educator]] Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to teach women about masturbation.<ref name="christophertrout" /><ref name="westheimer" /> Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method.<ref name="piastruck" /> In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book ''Liberating Masturbation''.<ref name="laurastuart">{{cite news | last = Stuart | first = Laura Anne | title = The Rebirth of the Magic Wand | newspaper = [[Express Milwaukee]] | date =19 April 2013 | url = http://expressmilwaukee.com/article-20926-the-rebirth-of-the-magic-wand.html | accessdate =6 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423022836/http://expressmilwaukee.com/article-20926-the-rebirth-of-the-magic-wand.html|archivedate=23 April 2013}}</ref> In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Hitachi Magic Wand.<ref name="christophertrout" /> In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to [[Dian Hanson]], former editor of men's magazines ''[[Leg Show]]'' and ''[[Juggs]]''.<ref name="christophertrout" /> Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said, "She told me to get a Hitachi Magic Wand, but to be careful of its power, both physical and psychological, as it's an addictive agent right behind heroin. My only previous vibrator experience was a pink plastic thing that held two D-cell batteries and the Hitachi was a whole 'nother world."<ref name="christophertrout" />

===Rebranding===
Because of its concerns about having its name attached to a popular sex toy, Hitachi decided to cease production of the Magic Wand in 2013.<ref name="christophertrout" /> Vibratex director of operations Eddie Romero told ''[[Engadget]]'' that Hitachi is a "very traditional" company and was uncomfortable being associated with the best-selling masturbation aid.<ref name="christophertrout" /> Vibratex persuaded Hitachi to continue manufacturing the device, to rename it the "Original Magic Wand", to use lighter, more durable materials, and to omit any reference to Hitachi.<ref name="christophertrout" /> The newly named device returned to  the market in June 2013, with improved engineering and modified graphic design on its accompanying box.<ref name="laurastuart" /> Hitachi does not market the device for sexual purposes.<ref>{{cite news|title='Oh Joy Sex Toy': The Internet's Most Radical Sex-Fueled Comic Strip|first=Rich|last=Goldstein|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=10 May 2014|publisher=The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC|via= [[NewsBank]]}}</ref> Betty Dodson told ''Engadget''; "Evidently, Mr. Hitachi Sr. didn't like the idea that his massage machine was giving millions of women orgasms&nbsp;...

==Academic research==

===Sexual dysfunction treatment===

Multiple academics have discussed use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to treat chronic [[anorgasmia]]{{mdash}}a type of sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasm{{mdash}}and other sexual problems including [[female sexual arousal disorder]].<ref name="piastruck" /><ref name="mcmullen" /><ref name="batshevamarcus" /><ref name="eaglin" />

A study published in 1979 in the ''[[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]]'' analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the Hitachi HV 250 massager to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the Hitachi Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.<ref name="mcmullen">{{cite journal|journal=[[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]]|title=Self-administered masturbation training in the treatment of primary orgasmic dysfunction|first=S|last=McMullen|author2=RC Rosen |date=October 1979|volume=47|issue=5|pages=912<U+2013>918|pmid=574521}}</ref>

In 2008 ''[[The Scientific World Journal]]'' published research in which women with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. Authors Pia Struck and S<U+00F8>ren Ventegodt chose the Hitachi Magic Wand because of the size of the device's head. In their paper, they said this effectively created a vibrating sensation in the area of the subject's clitoris and vulva without creating superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 465 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Hitachi Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. Struck and Ventegodt said their course of treatment, which included a holistic body of options including use of the Hitachi Magic Wand, was logical, harmless, and effective.<ref name="piastruck">{{cite journal|first=Pia|last=Struck|author2=S<U+00F8>ren Ventegodt |title=Research Article: Clinical Holistic Medicine: Teaching Orgasm for Females with Chronic Anorgasmia using the Betty Dodson Method|journal=[[The Scientific World Journal]]|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2008/249805/abs/|accessdate=20 September 2014|volume=8|date=2008|pages=883<U+2013>895|publisher=Hindawi Publishing Corporation|archivedate=26 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726015608/http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2008/249805/abs}}</ref>

Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' after introducing women to the Hitachi Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations. Marcus found there were six distinct patterns in her subjects' experiences after education with the device; some experienced significant changes in their manner of orgasm, others felt frightened of introducing an object outside of their own bodies into their routine of pleasure, over reliance, modifications to perceptions surrounding sex, and emotional changes in their lovers. She said medical professionals intending to suggest use of a vibrator to their female patients for conditions including female sexual arousal disorder and anorgasmia should discuss the impact this could have after use.<ref name="batshevamarcus">{{cite journal|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|title=Changes in a Woman's Sexual Experience and Expectations Following the Introduction of Electric Vibrator Assistance|volume=8|issue=12|date= December 2011|accessdate=20 September 2014|pages=3398<U+2013>3406|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21205230|last=Marcus|first= Bat Sheva|archivedate=28 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528110535/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21205230|pmid=21205230}}</ref>

In a 2011 paper for the [[Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]], authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell discussed changes in perceptions of sexual well-being in society. They said there has been a dearth of research on sex toys and their impact on sexual well-being. They discussed the Hitachi Magic Wand within the context of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose.<ref name="eaglin">{{cite journal|date=2011|journal=Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|title=Sex toys and designing for sexual wellness|first=Anna|last=Eaglin|author2=Shaowen Bardzell |pages=1837<U+2013>1842 |isbn= 978-1-4503-0268-5|doi=10.1145/1979742.1979879|publisher=[[Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]]; CHI EA '11 CHI '11 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems; The ACM Digital Library is published by the Association for Computing Machinery, ACM, Inc.}}</ref> 

The Hitachi Magic Wand has been used in studies in non-sexual applications.<ref name="smithcomite" /><ref name="rabin2004" />

===Sex for the disabled===
In their 2009 work ''Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities'', authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the supervision of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Hitachi Magic Wand in sexual activity for disabled persons. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Hitachi Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was "ideal for people with limited extension in their arms".<ref name="naphtali">{{cite book|pages=10, 22|first=Kate|last=Naphtali|author2=Edith MacHattie |author3=Andrei Krassioukov |author4=Stacy L Elliott |title=Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities|publisher= Disabilities Health Research Network|year=2009|oclc=756896097|url=http://www.dhrn.ca/files/sexualhealthmanual_lowres_2010_0208.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2014|archivedate=27 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227045000/http://www.dhrn.ca/files/sexualhealthmanual_lowres_2010_0208.pdf}}</ref>

===Dermatology ===
In a 2004 article published in ''Dermatology Online Journal'', authors Kevin C Smith, Stephen L Comite, Suprina Balasubramanian, Alan Carver and Judy F Liu reported on use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to help alleviate pain before cosmetic and dermatologic techniques performed by clinicians. The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing [[anesthesia]] with the injection of [[triamcinolone acetonide]] into the proximal [[Eponychium|nail fold]] for [[psoriasis]], decreasing discomfort during a [[Restylane]] injection of the [[nasolabial fold]], making an [[Intense Pulsed Light]] (IPL) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure, and throughout [[axillary hyperhidrosis]] treatment with [[botulinum toxin]]. They recommended use of the device with the "Wonder Wand" attachment to provide vibration to a decreased surface area on the patient. The authors said, "Although the use of vibration anesthesia generally does not eliminate pain completely, it can serve to make the injection or procedure much more tolerable".<ref name="smithcomite">{{Cite journal|pmid=15530291|title=Vibration anesthesia: A noninvasive method of reducing discomfort prior to dermatologic procedures|journal=[[Dermatology Online Journal]]|volume=10|issue=2|date=2004|publisher=UC Davis; eScholarship University of California; California Digital Library|first=Kevin C |last=Smith MD|author2=Stephen L Comite MD |author3=Suprina Balasubramanian |author4=Alan Carver MD |author5=Judy F Liu }}</ref>

Kevin C Smith and Francisco Perez-Atamoros further elaborated on use of the Hitachi Magic Wand in Chapter 7 "Other Dermatologic Uses of Botulinum Toxin" of the 2006 book ''Botulinum Toxin in Clinical Dermatology'', edited by Anthony V. Benedetto. They again emphasized the beneficial uses of the Magic Wand with the "Wonder Wand" attachment and showed how its vibrations can reduce pain if given just before an injection of Restylane within {{Convert|1|to|2|cm|inch|abbr=on}} from the injection site.<ref name="smithatamoros">{{cite book|year=2006|chapter=Chapter 7: Other Dermatologic Uses of Botulinum Toxin|editor=Anthony V.

===Neonatology===
Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu examined use of vibration delivery to infants to mitigate pain while doing [[Neonatal heel prick|heel stick]] procedures in a 2010 article for the ''[[Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing]]''. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Hitachi Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting and placed it on the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that, "Mechanical vibration produced an analgesic effect for infants who had previously experienced painful heel sticks that approached statistical significance".<ref name="baba2010" /> They concluded that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.<ref name="baba2010">{{cite journal|title=The Efficacy of Mechanical Vibration Analgesia for Relief of Heel Stick Pain in Neonates: A Novel Approach|last=Baba|first=Lisa R. |author2=Jacqueline M.

===Otolaryngology===
In a 2011 article for the ''International Journal of Otolaryngology'', Jeremy Hornibrook discussed the inner ear disorder [[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV). BPPV is the most common cause of [[vertigo]], a problem attributed to a detached [[otoconia]] in one of the semicircular canals.<ref name="hornibrook" /> Hornibrook gave background on the disorder and its pathology. The author recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote, "The most common repositioning treatment is Epley's CRP as modified by Parnes with one-minute pauses between head positions&nbsp;... Following the CRP a repeat Dix Hallpike test is done".<ref name="hornibrook" /> If such a test is positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Hitachi Magic Wand 250&nbsp;Hz massager to deliver vibrations to the area of the [[mastoid process]].<ref name="hornibrook">{{cite journal|first=Jeremy|last=Hornibrook|title=Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV): History, Pathophysiology, Office Treatment and Future Directions|journal=International Journal of Otolaryngology|doi=10.1155/2011/835671|date=18 May 2011|volume=2011|pages=5<U+2013>7}}</ref>

===Proprioception ===
Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon reported in 2004 in the ''[[Journal of Applied Physiology]]'' on their use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study [[proprioception]] signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. They created vibrations in the biceps muscles of their subjects while asking them to determine the position of their fingertips through spatial awareness of the human body with respect to its location. Rabin and Gordon said, "As expected, without tactile cues, biceps vibration caused illusory elbow extension".<ref name="rabin2004">{{cite journal|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/96/4/1555|accessdate=24 September 2014|title=Influence of fingertip contact on illusory arm movements|date=1 April 2004|first=Ely|last=Rabin|author2=Andrew M.

Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal ''[[Experimental Brain Research]]''. Their research concluded, "muscle stretch and tactile cues are integrated to locate the arm within a highly specific context associated with tactile and proprioceptive feedback from prior experience and current movement goals".<ref name="rabin2006">{{cite journal|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-005-0154-3|accessdate=25 September 2014|journal=[[Experimental Brain Research]]|title=Prior experience and current goals affect muscle-spindle and tactile integration|first=Ely |last=Rabin|author2=Andrew M.

Rabin and Gordon co-wrote a paper with Lisa Muratorib and Konstantina Svokosa, published in 2010 in ''[[Neuroscience Letters]]'', expanding on research incorporating use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. The authors said, "the somatosensory integration mechanism for prioritizing tactile and proprioception feedback in this task are not disrupted by PD, and are not related to the observed proprioceptive deficits".<ref name="rabin2010">{{cite journal|title=Tactile/proprioceptive integration during arm localization is intact in individuals with Parkinson's disease|journal=[[Neuroscience Letters]]|date=5 February 2010|first=Ely|last=Rabin|author2=Lisa Muratorib |author3=Konstantina Svokosa |author4=Andrew Gordonc |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2009.12.051|publisher=Elsevier B.V. |volume=470|issue=1|pages=38<U+2013>42}}</ref>

===Postural sway ===
In 2007, authors Laurie Swana, Hajime Otanib, and Peter V. Loubertc published a paper in the journal ''Gait & Posture'' about use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While tesing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Hitachi Magic Wand to each leg. The authors analysed whether postural sway decreased more while simultaneously challenging the subject to perform a balance assignment or a cognitive one. Their paper concluded, "Performing the difficult cognitive task, yet not the easy cognitive task, was associated with a decrease in postural sway&nbsp;... The decrease was not influenced by the difficulty of the balance task. The difficulty level of the cognitive task was the critical factor that decreased sway in dual task conditions."<ref name="swanaotanib">{{cite journal|first=Laurie|last=Swana|author2=Hajime Otanib |author3=Peter V.

Writing for the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', Alexis McKinnis recommended the device for a woman having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote, "Maybe vibration will do the trick&nbsp;... invest in a Hitachi Magic Wand.
