'''Christopher Greenup''' (c. 1750 {{ndash}} April 27, 1818) was an [[United States|American]] politician who served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and the third [[Governor of Kentucky]]. Little is known about his early life; the first reliable records about him are documents recording his service in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] where he served as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Continental Army]] and a [[colonel]] in the [[Virginia militia]].

After his service in the war, Greenup helped settle the trans-[[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] regions of Virginia. He became involved in politics, and played an active role in three of the ten statehood conventions that secured the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792. He became one of the state's first representatives, and served in the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] before being elected governor in a race where, due to his immense popularity, he ran unopposed. 

Greenup's term in office was marred by accusations that he had participated in the [[Spanish Conspiracy]] to align Kentucky with [[Spain]] prior to the former's separation from Virginia, but he vigorously and successfully rebutted these charges. Following his term as governor, he became less active in the political arena. He died on April 27, 1818. [[Greenup County, Kentucky]] and its [[county seat]] were both named in his honor.

==Early life in Virginia==
Christopher Greenup was most likely born in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]] around 1750.<ref name=harrison388>Harrison, p. 388</ref>{{ref|birth|[a]}} His parents were John and Elizabeth (Witten) Greenup.<ref name=eok>''Encyclopedia of Kentucky'', p. 72</ref> His early education was attained at the local schools of the area.<ref name=eok /> He learned [[surveying]] and studied law under Colonel Charles Binns at [[Charles City County, Virginia]].<ref name=harrison388 /><ref name=eok /><ref name=nga>NGA Bio</ref> He served in the Revolutionary War, attaining the rank of colonel in the Virginia militia and of lieutenant in the Continental Army.<ref name=nga />

In 1781, Greenup helped settle the area now known as [[Lincoln County, Kentucky]] where he spent time as a surveyor and a land speculator.<ref>Harrison, pp. 388&ndash;389</ref> He was admitted to practice law in the county court in 1782.<ref name=hopkins12>Hopkins, p. 12</ref> Following Virginia's creation of [[Kentucky County]] in 1783, he was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] of the [[district court]] of [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]] and served as clerk from 1785 to 1792.<ref name=hopkins12 /> 

In 1783, Greenup became one of the original trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later to become [[Transylvania University]].)<ref name=hopkins12 /><ref name=powell18 /> He purchased two lots of land in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and served as the clerk of the town's trustees.<ref name=hopkins12 /> In 1785, he represented [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] for a single term in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]].<ref name=hopkins12 /> When [[Mercer County, Kentucky|Mercer County]] was created later that year, he was appointed a justice there.<ref name=hopkins12 />

During this time, Greenup continued to practice law in Fayette County and pursued various other interests. He was a founding member of the [[Danville Political Club]] and in 1787, he joined the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge.<ref name=hopkins12 /><ref name=powell18 /> In 1789, he helped organize the Kentucky Manufacturing Society.<ref name=powell18 /> Later, he was appointed to the Kentucky River Company, a group dedicated to improving infrastructure on the [[Kentucky River]].<ref name=powell18 />

On July 9, 1787, during a brief return to Virginia, Greenup married Mary Catherine ("Cathy") Pope of [[Hanover County, Virginia]]; the couple had two children {{ndash}} Nancy and William.{{ref|children|[b]}} Cathy Greenup died October 22, 1809.<ref name=powell18 />

==Political career in Kentucky==
Greenup served as clerk of the first Kentucky statehood convention in [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]] in 1784. He was elected as a delegate to the second and sixth statehood conventions in 1785 and 1788, respectively, and was a trustee of the city of Danville in 1787.<ref name=eok /><ref name=powell18>Powell, p. 18</ref> 

When Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792, Greenup moved to Frankfort where he was rewarded for his efforts on behalf of the state by being chosen as an elector for the state's senators and governor.<ref name=powell18 /> He also served in the first [[Kentucky Senate]].<ref name=hopkins13>Hopkins, p. 13</ref> Following this, he was appointed to the court of [[oyer and terminer]], but resigned immediately to accept a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref name=harrison389>Harrison, p. 389</ref> He was one of Kentucky's first two representatives in the House, and was elected to three successive terms, serving from November 9, 1792 to March 3, 1797.<ref name=powell18 /> In 1798, he was elected to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]], representing Mercer County.<ref name=hopkins13 /> He also served as clerk of the state senate from 1799 to 1802.<ref name=harrison389 />

Greenup was a candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1800, but was runner-up to [[James Garrard]] in a four-man race that also included [[Benjamin Logan]] and [[Thomas Todd]].<ref>Powell, p. 16</ref> Garrard appointed him judge of the [[circuit court]] in 1802, but he resigned the post June 5, 1804 to make another run for the governorship.<ref name=hopkins13 /> Immensely popular, he ran unopposed, and served as governor from September 4, 1804 to September 1, 1808.<ref name=harrison389 /> During Greenup's administration, the state chartered the Bank of Kentucky and the Ohio Canal Company; Greenup became a director of the former in 1807.<ref name=powell18 /><ref name=harrison389 /> Despite his popularity, however, he was unable to pass much of his proposed agenda, which included provision of public education and reforms to the militia, courts, revenue system, and penal system.<ref name=harrison389 />

A Frankfort newspaper implicated Greenup in the Spanish Conspiracy, but he successfully defended himself and preserved his reputation.<ref name=harrison389 /> He deployed the Kentucky militia along the [[Ohio River]] to defend the state from any threat that might result from the [[Burr conspiracy]], but that threat had largely dissipated by 1807.<ref name=harrison389 />

Following his term as governor, Greenup was chosen as a presidential elector for the ticket of [[James Madison]] and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]].<ref name=powell18 /> In 1812, he became a [[justice of the peace]] in Franklin County.<ref name=powell18 /> He died April 27, 1818 at [[Blue Lick Springs Resort]], where he had traveled seeking relief from his [[rheumatism]].<ref name=eok /> He is buried in the [[Frankfort Cemetery]].<ref name=congbio>Congressional Biography</ref> [[Greenup County, Kentucky]] was named in his honor, as was its county seat of [[Greenup, Kentucky]].
