The '''Norwegian Sea''' ({{lang-no|Norskehavet}}) is a [[marginal sea]] in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], northwest of [[Norway]]. It is located between the [[North Sea]] (i.e. north of [[Scotland]]) and the [[Greenland Sea]] and adjoins the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and the [[Barents Sea]] to the northeast. In the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. To the North, the [[Jan Mayen]] Ridge separates it from the [[Greenland Sea]].

Unlike many other seas, most of the bottom of the Norwegian Sea is not part of a [[continental shelf]] and therefore lies at a great depth of about two kilometers on average. Rich deposits of oil and [[natural gas]] are found under the sea bottom and are being explored commercially, in the areas with the sea depths of up to about one kilometer. The coastal zones are rich in fish that visits the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic for [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]]. The warm [[North Atlantic Current]] ensures relatively stable and high water temperatures, so that contrary to the Arctic seas, the Norwegian Sea is ice free throughout the year.

== Extent ==
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Norwegian Sea as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|date=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref>

The Norwegian Sea was formed about 250 million years ago, when the [[Eurasian plate]] of Norway and the [[North American Plate]], including Greenland, started to move apart. The existing narrow shelf sea between Norway and Greenland began to widen and deepen.<ref name="Origin"> Terje Thornes and Oddvar Longva ''The origin of the coastal zone'' in: S<U+00E6>tre, 2007, pp. 35<U+2013>43</ref> The present continental slope in the Norwegian Sea marks the border between Norway and Greenland, as it stood approximately 250 million years ago. In the north it extends east from [[Svalbard]] and on the southwest between Britain and the Faroe. This continental slope contains rich fishing grounds and numerous [[coral reef]]s. Settling of the shelf after the separation of the continents had resulted in [[landslide]]s, such as the [[Storegga Slide]] about 8,000 years ago that induced a major [[tsunami]].<ref name="Origin"/>

The coasts of the Norwegian Sea were shaped during the last [[Ice Age]]. So, large, several kilometer tall [[glacier]]s pushed into the land forming fjords, removing the crust into the sea and thereby extending the continental slopes. This is particularly clear off the Norwegian coast near the [[Lofoten Islands]].<ref name="Origin"/> The [[Norwegian continental shelf]] is between 40 and 200 kilometers wide, and has a different shape from the shelves in the North Sea and Barents Sea. It contains numerous trenches and irregular peaks which usually have an amplitude of less than 100 meters, but it can reach up to 400 meters.<ref name="Driving"/> They are covered with a mixture of gravel, sand and mud, and the trenches are used by fish as a spawning ground.<ref name="Origin"/> Deeper into the sea, there are two deep basins separated by a low ridge (deepest point at 3,000 m) between the [[V<U+00F8>ring Plateau]] and [[Jan Mayen]] island. The southern basin is larger and deeper, with large areas between 3,500 and 4,000 meters deep. The northern basin is shallower at 3,200<U+2013>3,300 m, but contains many individual sites going down to 3,500 meters.<ref name=b366/> Submarine thresholds and continental slopes mark the borders of these basins with the adjacent seas. To the south lies the European [[continental shelf]] and the North Sea, to the east is the Eurasian continental shelf with the Barents Sea. To the west, the [[Scotland-Greenland Ridge]] separates the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic. This ridge is on average only 500 meters deep, only in a few places reaching the depth of 850 meters. To the north lie the Jan Mayen Ridge and Mohns Ridge, which lie at a depth of 2,000 meters, with some trenches reaching the depths of 2,600 meters.<ref name = b366/>

== Hydrology==
[[File:Thermohaline Circulation 2.png|thumb|Thermohaline circulation explains the formation of cold, dense deep water in the Norwegian Sea. The entire circulation pattern takes ~2000 years to complete.]]
[[File:Golfstream.jpg|thumb|Surface currents in the North Atlantic]]
Four major water masses originating in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans meet in the Norwegian Sea, and the associated currents are of fundamental importance for the global climate. The warm, salty [[North Atlantic Current]] flows in from the Atlantic Ocean, and the colder and less saline [[Norwegian Current]] originates in the North Sea. The so-called East Iceland Current transports cold water south from the Norwegian Sea towards Iceland and then east, along the [[Arctic Circle]]; this current occurs in the middle water layer. Deep water flows into the Norwegian Sea from the Greenland Sea.<ref name=b366/> The tides in the sea are semi-diurnal, that is they rise twice a day to the height of about 3.3 meters.<ref name=bse/>

==== Surface currents==== 
The hydrology of the upper water layers is largely determined by the flow from the North Atlantic. It reaches the speed of 10 [[Sverdrup|Sv]] (1 Sv = million m<sup>3</sup>/s) and its maximum depth is 700 meters at the Lofoten Islands, but normally it is within 500 meters.<ref name=b366/> Part of it comes through the Faeroe-Shetland Channel and has a comparatively high [[salinity]] of 35.3<U+2030> (parts per thousand). This current originates in the North Atlantic Current and passes along the European continental slope; increased evaporation due to the warm European climate results in the elevated salinity. Another part passes through the Greenland-Scotland-trench between the Faroe Islands and [[Iceland]]; this water has a mean salinity between 35 and 35.2<U+2030>.<ref name="Aken119"> Hendrik Mattheus van Aken [http://books.google.com/books?id=dGydMj2madMC&pg=PA119 ''The Oceanic Thermohaline Circulation: An Introduction''], Springer, 2007 ISBN 0-387-36637-7, pp. 119<U+2013>124</ref> The flow shows strong seasonal variations and can be twice higher in winter than in summer.<ref name="Driving"/> While at the Faeroe-Shetland Channel it has a temperature of about 9.5 <U+00B0>C, it cools down to about 5 <U+00B0>C at Svalbard and releases this energy (about 250 terawatt) to the environment.<ref name=b366/><ref name="Driving"> Roald S<U+00E6>tre ''Driving forces'' in: S<U+00E6>tre, 2007, pp. 44<U+2013>58</ref>

The current flowing from the [[North Sea]] originates in the Baltic Sea and thus collects most of the drainage from northern Europe; this contribution is however relatively small.<ref name="Driving">S<U+00E6>tre, 2007, pp. 44<U+2013>58</ref> The temperature and salinity of this current shows strong seasonal and annual fluctuations. Long-term measurements within the top 50 meters near the coast result in a maximum temperature of 11.2 <U+00B0>C at the 63<U+00B0> N [[Circle of latitude|parallel]] in September and a minimum of 3.9 <U+00B0>C at North Cape in March. The salinity varies between 34.3 and 34.6<U+2030> and is the lowest in spring owing to the inflow of the melted snow by the rivers.<ref name=b366/> The largest rivers discharging into the sea are [[Namsen]], [[Ranelva]] and [[Vefsna]]. They are all relatively short, but have a high discharge rate owing to their steep mountainous nature.<ref name="Sepp"/>

Some part of warm surface water flows directly, within the [[West Spitsbergen Current]], from the Atlantic Ocean, off the Greenland Sea, to the Arctic Ocean. This current has a speed of 3<U+2013>5 Sv and has a large impact on the climate.<ref name="Tyler45">Tyler, pp. 45<U+2013>49 </ref> Other surface water (~1 Sv) flows along the Norwegian coast in the direction of the [[Barents Sea]]. This water may cool in the Norwegian Sea enough do submerge into the deeper layers; there it displaces water which flows back into the North Atlantic.<ref name="Tyler">Tyler, pp. 115<U+2013>116</ref>

Arctic water from the East Iceland Current is mostly found in the southwestern part of the sea, near Greenland. Its properties also show significant annual fluctuations in its properties, with the long-term average temperature below 3 <U+00B0>C and salinity of 34.7<U+2013>34.9<U+2030>.<ref name=b366/> The fraction of this water on the sea surface depends on the strength of the current, which in turn depends on the pressure difference between the [[Icelandic Low]] and [[Azores High]] <U+2013> the larger the difference, the stronger the current.<ref name="ICES2"> ICES, pp. 2<U+2013>4</ref>

====Deep-sea currents ====
The Norwegian Sea is connected with the Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean by the 2,600-meter deep [[Fram Strait]].<ref name="Tyler240">Tyler, pp. 240<U+2013>260</ref> The Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW) occurs at depths exceeding 2,000 meters; this homogeneous layer with a salinity of 34.91<U+2030> experiences little exchange with the adjacent seas. Its temperature is below 0 <U+00B0>C and drops to <U+2212>1 <U+00B0>C at the ocean floor.<ref name=b366/> Compared with the deep waters of the surrounding seas, NSDW has more nutrients, but less oxygen and is relatively old.<ref name = "Aken"> Hendrik Mattheus van Aken: [http://books.google.com/books?id=dGydMj2madMC&pg=PA131 ''The Oceanic Thermohaline Circulation: An Introduction''], Springer, 2007 ISBN 0-387-36637-7, pp. 131<U+2013>138</ref>

The weak deep-water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean is due to the small depth of the relatively flat [[Greenland-Scotland Ridge]] between Scotland and Greenland, an offshoot of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. Only four areas of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge are deeper than 500 meters: the [[Faroe Bank Channel]] (about 850 meters), some parts of the [[Iceland-Faroe Ridge]] (about 600 meters), the [[Wyville-Thomson Ridge]] (620 meters) and areas between [[Greenland]] and [[Denmark Strait]] (850 meters) <U+2013> this is much shallower than the Norwegian Sea.<ref name="Aken"/><ref name="Tyler"/> Cold deep water flows into the Atlantic through various channels: about 1.9 Sv through the Faroe Bank channel, 1.1 Sv through the Iceland-Faroe channel and 0.1 Sv via the Wyville-Thomson Ridge.<ref name="Skreslet93"> Stig Skreslet, North Atlantic Treaty Organization ''Jan Mayen Iceland in Scientific Focus'', Springer, 2005 ISBN 1-4020-2956-X, p. 93</ref> The turbulence that occurs when the deep water falls behind the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the deep Atlantic basin mixes the adjacent water layers and forms the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]], one of two major deep-sea currents providing the deep ocean with oxygen.<ref name="Threat"> Ronald E.

== Climate ==
The thermohaline circulation affects the climate in the Norwegian Sea, and the regional climate can significantly deviate from average. There is also a difference of about 10 <U+00B0>C between the sea and the coastline. Temperatures rose between 1920 and 1960,<ref name="Wefer"> Gerold Wefer, Frank Lamy, Fauzi Mantoura [http://books.google.com/books?id=wC7CF9Bd5CoC&pg=PA32 ''Marine Science Frontiers for Europe''], Springer, 2003 ISBN 3-540-40168-7, pp. 32<U+2013>35</ref> and the frequency of storms decreased in this period. The storminess was relatively high between 1880 and 1910, decreased significantly in 1910<U+2013>1960, and then recovered to the original level.<ref name="Sepp"> Matti Sepp<U+00E4>l<U+00E4> [http://books.google.com/books?id=q33WekTp7tgC&pg=PA121 ''The Physical Geography of Fennoscandia''], Oxford University Press, 2005 ISBN 0-19-924590-8, pp. 121<U+2013>141</ref>

In contrast to the Greenland Sea and Arctic seas, the Norwegian Sea is ice-free year round, owing to its warm currents.<ref name=bse/> The convection between the relatively warm water and cold air in the winter plays an important role in the Arctic climate.<ref name="Sch<U+00E4>fer10"> Priska Schaefer [http://books.google.com/books?id=iVAzudOPt1kC&pg=PA10 ''The Northern North Atlantic: A Changing Environment''], Springer, 2001 ISBN 3-540-67231-1, pp. 10<U+2013>17</ref> The 10-degree July isotherm (air temperature) runs through the northern boundary of the Norwegian Sea and is often taken as the southern boundary of the Arctic.<ref name="Mulvaney"> Kieran Mulvaney [http://books.google.com/books?id=1_T7JZveHkAC&pg=PA23 ''At the Ends of the Earth: A History of the Polar Regions''], Iceland Press, 2001 ISBN 1-55963-908-3, p. 23</ref> The Norwegian Sea in winter generally has the lowest air pressure in the entire Arctic and is a region where most [[Icelandic Low]] depressions form.<ref name="Leroux235">Marcel Leroux ''Global Warming: Myth or Reality: The Ways of Climatology erring'', Springer, 2005 ISBN 3-540-23909-X</ref> The water temperature in most parts of the sea is 2<U+2013>7 <U+00B0>C in February and 8<U+2013>12 <U+00B0>C in August.<ref name=bse/>

[[File:Bloom in the Norwegian Sea.jpg|thumb|[[Phytoplankton]] bloom in the Norwegian Sea.]]
==Flora and fauna== 
The Norwegian Sea as a transition zone between [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] and Arctic conditions, and thus contains flora and fauna characteristic to both climatic regions.<ref name=b366>Blindheim, pp. 366<U+2013>382</ref> The southern limit of many Arctic species runs through North Cape, Iceland and the center of the Norwegian Sea, while the northern limit of boreal species lies near the borders of the Greenland Sea with the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, i.e. these areas overlap. Some species like the [[scallop]] ''[[Chlamys islandica]]'' and [[capelin]] tend to occupy this area between the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.<ref name="Skreslet103"> Stig Skreslet, North Atlantic Treaty Organization ''Jan Mayen Iceland in Scientific Focus'', Springer, 2005 ISBN 1-X-4020-2956, pp. 103<U+2013>114</ref>

=== Plankton and sea bottom organisms=== 
Most of the aquatic life in the Norwegian Sea is concentrated in the upper layers. Estimates for the entire North Atlantic are that only 2% of biomass is produced at depths below 1,000 meters and only 1.2% occur near the sea floor.<ref name="Sch<U+00E4>fer81"> Ritzrau Andrea Schroeder ''et al.'' ''Distribution, export and alteration of plankton in the Norwegian Sea Fossiliziable'' in: Priska Schaefer: [http://books.google.com/books?id=iVAzudOPt1kC&pg=PA81 ''The Northern North Atlantic: A Changing Environment''], Springer, 2001 ISBN 3-540-67231-1, pp. 81<U+2013>104 </ref>

The blooming of the [[phytoplankton]] is dominated by the [[chlorophyll]] and peaks around 20 May. The major phytoplankton forms are [[diatoms]], in particular the genus ''[[Thalassiosira]]'' and ''[[Chaetoceros]]''. After the spring bloom the [[haptophytes]] of the genus ''[[Phaecocystis pouchetti]]'' become dominant.<ref name="ICES5"> ICES, pp. 5<U+2013>8</ref>

</gallery></center>

Zooplankton is mostly represented by the [[copepods]] ''Calanus finmarchicus'' and ''Calanus hyperboreus'' where the former occurs about four times more often than the latter and is mostly found in the Atlantic streams, whereas ''C. hyperboreus'' dominates the Arctic waters;<ref name="ICES5"/> they are the main diet of most marine predators.<ref name = "Skreslet103" /> The most important krill species are ''[[Northern krill|Meganyctiphanes norvegica]]'', ''[[Thyssanoessa inermis]]'' and ''[[Thyssanoessa longicaudata]]''.<ref name="ICES5"/> In contrast to the Greenland Sea, there is a significant presence of [[calcareous]] plankton ([[Coccolithophore]] and [[Globigerinida]]) in the Norwegian Sea.<ref name="Sch<U+00E4>fer81"/> Plankton production strongly fluctuates between years. So ''C. finmarchicus'' yield was 28 g/m<U+00B2> (dry weight) in 1995 and only 8 g/m<U+00B2> in 1997; this correspondingly affected the population of all its predators.<ref name="ICES5"/>

Shrimp of the species ''[[Pandalus borealis]]'' play an important role in the diet of fish, particularly cod and [[blue whiting]], and mostly occur at the depths between 200 and 300 meters. A special feature of the Norwegian Sea are extensive coral reefs of ''[[Lophelia pertusa]]'', which provide shelter to various fish species. Although these corals are widespread in many peripheral areas of the North Atlantic, they never reach such amounts and concentrations as at the Norwegian continental slopes. However, they are at risk due to increasing [[trawling]], which mechanically destroys the coral reefs.<ref name="ICES5"/>

=== Fish=== 
[[File:Heringsschwarm.gif|thumb|Herring]]
The Norwegian coastal waters are the most important spawning ground of the [[Atlantic Herring|herring populations]] of the North Atlantic, and the hatching occurs in March. The eggs float to the surface and are washed off the coast by the northward current. Whereas a small  herring population remains in the fjords and along the northern Norwegian coast, the majority spends the summer in the Barents Sea, where it feeds on the rich plankton. Upon reaching puberty, herring returns to the Norwegian Sea.<ref name="Blindheim382">Blindheim, pp. 382<U+2013>401</ref> The herring stock varies greatly between the years. It increased in the 1920s owing to the milder climate an then collapsed in the following decades until 1970; the decrease was however at least partly affected by overfishing.<ref name="Wefer"/> The biomass of young hatched herring declined from 11 million tonnes in 1956 to almost zero in 1970<ref name="Skreslet103"/> that affected the ecosystem not only of the Norwegian Sea but also of the Barents Sea.<ref name="Stokke">Olav Schram Stokke ''Governing High Seas Fisheries: The Interplay of Global and Regional regime,'' Oxford University Press, 2001 ISBN 0-19-829949-4, pp. 241<U+2013>255</ref>

[[File:Mallotus villosus.gif|thumb|[[Capelin]] is a common fish of the Atlantic-arctic transitional waters]]
Enforcement of environmental and fishing regulations resulted in partial recovery of the herring  populations since 1987.<ref name="Wefer"/><ref name="Skreslet103"/> This recovery was accompanied by a decline of capelin and cod stocks. While the capelin benefited from the reduced fishing, the temperature rise in the 1980s and competition for food with the herring resulted in a near disappearance of young capelin from the Norwegian Sea.<ref name="Helfman321">Gene S. Helfman ''Fish Conservation: A Guide to Understanding and Restoring Global Aquatic Biodiversity and Fishery Resources'', Iceland Press, 2007 ISBN 1-55963-595-9, pp. 321<U+2013>323</ref> Meanwhile, the elderly capelin population was quickly fished out. This also reduced the population of cod <U+2013> a major predator of capelin <U+2013> as the herring was still too small in numbers to replace the capelin in the cod's diet.<ref name="NRC"> National Research Council (U.S.).

[[Blue whiting]] (''Micromesistius poutassou'') has benefited from the decline of the herring and capelin stocks as it assumed the role of major predator of plankton. The blue whiting spawns near the British Isles. The sea currents carry their eggs to the Norwegian Sea, and the adults also swim there in order to benefit from the food supply. The young spend the summer and the winter until February in the Norwegian coastal waters and then return to the warmer waters west of Scotland.<ref name=b366/> The Norwegian Arctic cod is mostly occurs in the Barents Sea and at the [[Svalbard]] Archipelago. In the rest of the Norwegian Sea, it is found only during the reproduction season, at the Lofoten Islands,<ref name="Blindheim382"/> whereas [[Pollachius virens]] and [[haddock]] spawn in the coastal waters.<ref name=b366/> [[Mackerel]] is an important commercial fish. The coral reefs are populated by different species of the genus ''[[Sebastes]]''.<ref name="ICES5"/>

They are hunted by Norway and Iceland with a quota of about 1,000 per year in Norway.

[[Bowhead whale]] used to be a major plankton predator, but it almost disappeared from the Norwegian Sea after intense whaling in the 19th century,<ref name="Skreslet103"/> and was temporarily extinct in the entire North Atlantic. Similarly, the [[blue whale]] used to form large groups between Jan Mayen and Spitsbergen, but is hardly present nowadays.<ref name="Johnson95">Johnson, pp. 95<U+2013>101</ref> Observations of [[northern bottlenose whale]] in the Norwegian Sea are rare.<ref Northern Bottlenose Whale name="Dolphins320"> Margaret Klinowska Others (Eds) ''Dolphins, Porpoises and Whales of the World: The IUCN Red Data Book'', IUCN, 1991 ISBN 2-88032-936-1, p. 320</ref> Other large animals of the sea are [[hooded seal|hooded]] and [[harp seal]]s and [[squid]].<ref name = "Skreslet103" />

Important waterfowl species of the Norwegian Sea are [[puffin]], [[kittiwake]] and [[guillemot]]. Puffins and guillemots also suffered from the collapse of the herring population, especially the puffins on the Lofoten Islands. The latter hardly had an alternative to herring and their population declined about twice between 1969 and 1987.<ref name="Jennings">Simon Jennings ''et al.''

== Human activities ==
Norway, Iceland and Denmark/Faroe Islands share the territorial waters of the Norwegian Sea, with the largest part belonging to the former country. Norway claimed [[territorial waters|twelve-mile limit]] as territorial waters since 2004 and an exclusive economic zone of 200 miles since 1976. Consequently, due to the Norwegian islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen, the southeast, northeast and northwest edge of the sea occur within Norway. The southwest border is shared between Iceland and Denmark/Faroe Islands.<ref name="Noel"/>

The largest damage to the Norwegian Sea was caused by extensive fishing, whaling and pollution. The British nuclear complex [[Sellafield]] is one of the greatest polluters, discharging radioactive waste into the sea. Other contamination is mostly by oil and toxic substances,<ref name="Noel"> Alf H<U+00E5>kon Noel ''The Performance of Exclusive Economic Zones <U+2013> The Case of Norway'' in: Syma A. Ebbin et al.

=== Fishing and whaling=== 
[[File: Cod lofoten.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional [[cod]] stand]]
[[File: 18th century arctic whaling.jpg|thumb|Arctic whaling (18th century). The ships are Dutch and the animals are [[bowhead whale]]s. Beerenburg on Jan Mayen Land can be seen in the background.]]
Fishing near Lofoten archipelago has been practiced for hundreds years. The coastal waters of remote Lofoten islands are one of the richest fishing areas in Europe as most of the Atlantic cod swims in the winter to the coastal waters of Lofoten to spawn. So in the 19th century, dried cod was one of Norway's main areas of exports and by far the most important industry in northern Norway. Strong sea currents, [[maelstrom]]s, and especially frequent storms made fishing a dangerous occupation: several hundred men died on the "Fatal Monday" in March 1821, 300 of them being from a single [[parish]], and about a hundred boats with their crews were lost within a short time in April 1875.<ref name="Smith10"> Tim Denis Smith [http://books.google.com/books?id=glYeaAEaKGgC&pg=PA10 ''Scaling Fisheries: The Science of Measuring the Effects of Fishing, 1855<U+2013>1955''], Cambridge University Press, 1994 ISBN 0-521-39032-X, pp. 10<U+2013>15</ref>

Whaling was also important for the Norwegian Sea. In the early 1600s, the Englishman [[Stephen Bennet]] started hunting [[walrus]] at the [[Bear Island]]. In May 1607 the [[Muscovy Company]], while looking for the [[Northwest Passage]] and exploring the sea, discovered the large populations of walrus and whales in the Norwegian Sea and started hunting them in 1610 near [[Spitsbergen]].<ref name="Richards589">John F.

===Sea monsters and maelstroms === 
[[File: Carta Marina.jpeg|thumb|The [[Carta Marina]] (1539) by [[Olaus Magnus]] is the earliest detailed map of the Nordic countries. Note various sea monsters on the map.]]
[[File:Maelstrom-Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration for [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s story "Descent into the Maelstrom" by [[Harry Clarke]] (1889<U+2013>1931), published in 1919.]]
For many centuries, the Norwegian Sea was regarded as the edge of the known world. The disappearance of ships there, due to the natural disasters, induced legends of the monsters ([[kraken]]) which halt and sink ships. As late as in 1845, the [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia metropolitana]] contained a multi-page review by [[Erik Pontoppidan]] (1698<U+2013>1764) on ship-sinking sea monsters of half a mile in size.<ref name="Krak">''Octopus'' in:. E. Smedley et al. (Eds): ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia metropolitana; or, universal dictionary of knowledge'' in 1845, pp. 326<U+2013>330</ref> Many legends might be based on the work ''[[Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus]]'' of 1539 by [[Olaus Magnus]] where he described the kraken and maelstroms of the Norwegian Sea.<ref name="Glavin">Terry Glavin ''The Sixth Extinction: Journeys Among the Lost and Left Behind'', Macmillan, 2007 ISBN 0-312-36231-5, p. 149</ref> The kraken also appeared in [[Alfred Tennyson]]'s poem of the same, in Herman Melville's ''[[Moby Dick]]'' and in ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].

Between the Lofoten islands of [[Moskenes<U+00F8>ya]] and [[V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y]], at the tiny [[Mosken]] island, lies the [[Moskenstraumen]] <U+2013> a system of [[tide|tidal]] [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] and a [[whirlpool]] called a [[maelstrom]]. With the speed of the order of 15 km/h (the value strongly varies between the sources), it is one of the strongest maelstroms in the world. It was described in the 13th century in the [[Old Norse]] poems [[Edda]] and remained an attractive subject for painters and writers, including [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Walter Moers]] and [[Jules Verne]]. The term maelstrom originates from the combination of Dutch words ''malen'' (to grind) and ''strom'' (stream); it was introduced into English language by Poe in his story "[[A Descent into the Maelstr<U+00F6>m]]" (1841) describing the Moskenstraumen.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&pg=PA300 The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories], 1991, ISBN 0877796033 p. 300</ref> The Moskenstraumen is created as a result of a combination of several factors, including the tides, position of the Lofoten and the underwater topography; unlike most others whirls, it is located in the open sea rather than in a channel or bay. With the diameter of 40<U+2013>50 meters, it can endanger small fishing vessels even in modern time, which might be attracted by the abundant cod feeding on the microorganisms sucked by the whirl.<ref name="Koppel"> Tom Kopel [http://books.google.com/books?id=acqyEz8TViMC&pg=PA76 ''Ebb and Flow: Tides and Life on Our Once and Future Planet''], Dundurn Press, 2007 ISBN 1-55002-726-3, pp. 76<U+2013>79</ref>

=== Exploration=== 
[[File:Nordatlantiska str<U+00F6>mmar, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|In the late 19th century, [[Henrik Mohn]] developed the first dynamic flow model of the North Atlantic. This map of 1904 shows surface and underwater currents.]]
The fish-rich coastal waters of northern Norway were known for ages and were attracting skilled sailors from Iceland and Greenland. Thus most settlements in Iceland and Greenland were on the west coasts of the islands, which were also warmer due to the Atlantic currents. The first reasonably reliable map of northern Europe, the [[Carta marina]] of 1539 represents the Norwegian Sea as coastal waters and shows nothing north of North Cape. The Norwegian Sea off the coast regions appeared on the maps in the 17th century as an important part of the then-to-find [[Northern Sea Route]] and a rich whaling ground.<ref name="Kent300"> Neil Kent ''The Soul of the North: A Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700<U+2013>1940'', Reaktion Books, 2001 ISBN 1-86189-067-2, pp. 300<U+2013>302</ref>

Jan Mayen island was discovered in 1607 and become an important base of Dutch whalers. The Dutchman [[Willem Barents]] discovered [[Bear Island]] and [[Svalbard]],<ref name="Kent300"/> which was then used by Russian whalers called [[pomors]]. The islands on the edge of the Norwegian Sea have been rapidly divided between nations. During the peaks of whaling, some 300 ships with 12,000 crew members were yearly visiting Svalbard.<ref name="Kent300"/> 

The first [[Sounding line|depth measurements]] of the Norwegian Sea were performed in 1773 by [[Constantine Phipps]] aboard HMS ''Racehorse'', as a part of his North Pole expedition.<ref name="Sommerhayes93"> Colin Summerhayes.''The exploration of the sea floor in ''Margaret Deacon et al.

=== Navigation ===

Until the 20th century, the coasts of the Norwegian Sea were sparsely populated and therefore shipping in the sea was mostly focused on fishing, whaling and occasional coastal transportations. Since the late 19th century, the [[Hurtigruten|Norwegian Coastal Express]] sea line was established connecting the more densely populated south with the north of Norway by at least one trip a day. The importance of shipping in the Norwegian Sea increased with the expansion of the Russian and Soviet navies in the Barents Sea and development of international routes to the Atlantic through the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Kattegat]], [[Skagerrak]] and [[North Sea]].

The Norwegian Sea is ice free and provides a direct route from the Atlantic to the Russian ports in the Arctic ([[Murmansk]], [[Archangel]], [[Kandalaksha]]) which are directly linked to the central Russia. This route was extensively used for supplies during World War II <U+2013> from 811 US ships, 720 reached Russian ports bringing some 4 million tonnes of cargo which included about 5,000 tanks and 7,000 aircraft. The Allies lost 18 convoys and 89 merchant ships on this route.<ref name="Killham106"> Edward L. Killham: ''The Nordic Way: A Path to Baltic Equilibrium''Howells House, 1993 ISBN 0-929590-12-0, p. 106</ref> The major operations of the German Navy against the convoys included [[Convoy PQ 17|PQ 17]] in July 1942, the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] in December 1942 and the [[Battle of the North Cape]] in December 1943 and were carried out around the border between Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, near the North Cape.<ref name="Killham106"/>

Navigation across the Norwegian Sea declined after the World War II and intensified only in the 1960s<U+2013>70s with the expansion of the [[Soviet Northern Fleet]] that was reflected in major joint naval exercises of the Soviet Northern Baltic fleets in the Norwegian Sea. The sea was the gateway for the Soviet Navy to the Atlantic Ocean and thus to the United States, and a major Soviet port of [[Murmansk]] was just behind the border of the Norwegian and Barents Sea.<ref name="Sokolsky83"> Joel J. Sokolsky ''Seapower in the Nuclear Age: The United States Navy and NATO, 1949<U+2013>80'' Taylor & Francis, 1991 ISBN 0-415-00806-9, pp. 83<U+2013>87</ref> The countermeasures by the NATO countries resulted in a significant naval presence in the Norwegian Sea and intense cat-and-mouse games between Soviet and NATO aircraft, ships and especially submarines.<ref name="Riste"> Olav Riste.

The Norwegian Sea is part of the [[Northern Sea Route]] for ships from European ports to Asia. The travel distance from [[Rotterdam]] to [[Tokyo]] is 21,100 km via [[Suez Canal]] and only 14,100 km through the Norwegian Sea. Sea ice is a common problem in the Arctic seas, but ice-free condition along the entire northern route was observed in the end of August 2008.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,574539,00.html Northeast <U+2013> and the Northwest Passage ice-free for the first time at the same time], Spiegel</ref> Russia is planning to expand its offshore oil production in the Arctic that should increase the traffic of tankers through the Norwegian Sea to markets in Europe and America; it is expected that the number of oil shipments through the northern Norwegian Sea will increase from 166 in 2002 to 615 in 2015.<ref> Leichenko Robin M., Karen L.

===Oil and gas===
The most important products of the Norwegian Sea are no longer fish, but are oil and especially gas found under the Norwegian Sea.<ref> Jerome D. Davis. ''Changing World of Oil: An Analysis of Corporate Change and Adaptation'' Ashgate Publishing, 2006 ISBN 0-7546-4178-3, p. 139</ref> Norway started undersea oil production in 1993 followed by development of the gas field Huldra in 2001.<ref name="Falola">Ann Genova ''The Politics of the Global Oil Industry'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005 ISBN 0-275-98400-1, pp. 202<U+2013>209</ref> The large depth and harsh waters of the Norwegian Sea pose significant technical challenges for offshore drilling.<ref name="Kristin"/> Whereas drilling at depths exceeding 500 meters is conducted since 1995, only a few deep gas fields are explored commercially. The most important current project is [[Ormen Lange (gas field)|Ormen Lange]] (depth 800-1,100 m) where gas production started in 2007. With the reserves of 1.4{{e|13}} cubic feet, it is the major Norwegian gas field. It is connected to the [[Langeled]] pipeline, currently the world's longest underwater pipeline, and thus to a major European gas pipeline network.<ref name="eiaN">[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Norway/Full.html ''Country Analysis Briefs: Norway''], Energy Information Administration</ref><ref>
