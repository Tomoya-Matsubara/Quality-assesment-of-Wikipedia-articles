{{Main|Wife selling (English custom)}}
The English custom of wife selling began in the late 17th century when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a [[halter]] around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly [[auction]] her to the highest bidder. Although the custom had no basis in law and frequently resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, the attitude of the authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local [[English Poor Law|Poor Law Commissioners]] forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in [[workhouse]]s. The English custom of wife selling spread to [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Australia]],<ref>Valenze, Deborah M., ''The Social Life of Money in the English Past'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2006 (ISBN-13 978-0-521-61780-2)), p. 249 & probably n. 83 (n. omitted) (author prof. history, Barnard Coll.), n. 83 citing Ihde, Erin, ''"So Gross a Violation of Decency": A Note on Wife Sales in Colonial Australia'', in ''Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society'', vol. 84, Jun., 1998, pp. 26<U+2013>27, & Hughes, Robert, ''The Fatal Shore: An Epic of Australia's Founding'' (N.Y., no publisher cited: 1986), pp. 244<U+2013>264.</ref> and the [[United States]] before dying out in the early 20th century.

=== China ===
The Chinese custom of wife selling or selling a divorce ({{zh|c=<U+4EE5><U+8D22><U+4E70><U+4F11>}}) has a long history, spanning both the Imperial and Modern eras.

The earliest documentation of the practice appears in [[Yuan Dynasty]] law dating to the 14th century. At that time, two types of wife selling were recognized, both considered illegal. The first type was when a husband sold his wife to a man with whom she had been committing [[adultery]]. The second type was when a husband sold his wife because she had betrayed him or because they were no longer able to get along. During the [[Ming Dynasty]], it was gradually established that only wife selling which was motivated by adultery should be punished. By 1568, wife selling was explicitly authorized by the law in several circumstances.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} Authorized wife selling was preserved by [[Qing Dynasty]] lawmakers, as was the prohibition against selling a wife to her lover.<ref name=Sommer>{{cite book|last=Sommer|first=Matthew Harvey|title=Sex, Law, and Society in Late Imperial China|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=57<U+2013>64}}</ref>

====Contemporary wife selling in China====

As the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] came to power in 1949<ref name="FangLeong"/>, wife selling was prohibited and the government took measures to eradicate the practice.<ref>{{cite book|title=River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze|first=Peter|last=Hessler|year=2001|page=281|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0060953748}}</ref> During the famines caused by the [[Great Leap Forward]] wife selling occurred in many of the poorer areas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Edward|title=Chinese Village, Socialist State|year=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300054289|page=241|coauthors=Paul G. Pickowicz, Mark Selden, Kay Ann Johnson}}</ref> 
As of 1997, the custom was still occasionally reported in some rural areas of the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zweig|first=David|title=Freeing China's Farmers: Rural Restructuring in the Reform Era|year=1997|publisher=M. E. Sharpe|location=London|isbn=1563248387|page=343}}</ref>

From 1991 to 1996 Chinese police rescued upwards of 88,000 women and children who had been sold into marriage and slavery, and the Chinese government claims that 143,000 traffickers involved were caught and prosecuted. Some human rights groups state that the figures are not correct and that the real number of abducted women are higher. Bay Fang and Mark Leong reported in ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' that "the government sees the commerce in wives as a shameful problem, it has only in recent years begun to provide any statistics, and it tries to put the focus on the women who have been saved rather than on the continuing trade." As women leave rural areas to find work in cities, they are considered more vulnerable to being "tricked or forced into becoming chattel for men desperate for wives." The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimated that in 1998 there were 120 men for every 100 women, with imbalances in rural areas being about 130 males for everyone 100 females, triggered by China's traditional preference for male children. This gender imbalance co-contributes to the continuance of wife selling alongside women moving from rural communities. The increase in the cost of [[Dowry|dowries]] are also a contributing factor leading men to buy women for wives. [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]] states that it is more affordable for a man to buy a wife from a trafficker for 2,000 to 4,000 yuan than to pay a traditional [[dowry]], which often runs upwards of 10,000 yuan. For the average urban worker, wife selling is an affordable option when in 1998 China urban workers make approximately $60 a month.<ref name="FangLeong">{{cite journal |last1=Fang |first1=Bay |last2=Leong |first2=Mark |year=1998 |title=China's stolen wives. |journal=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |volume=125 |issue=14 |pages=35 |url=http://proxygw.wrlc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=1124645&site=ehost-live |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}{{subscription required}}</ref>

Chinese women who are bought as wives who bear children are more prone to staying within the marriage. Fang Yuzhu of the [[China Women's Federation]] credits it with a "strong sense of duty" that Chinese women have, and the idea that it is shameful to leave their husband. Yuzhu also credits that some women might consider their forced marriage a better option to the life of poverty and hard labor they would be subject to upon returning home or the idea that some women may not feel the can find another husband, since they "have already been with one "husband.""<ref name="FangLeong"/>

== Criticism ==
A wife being subject to sale was a consequence of her being a man's property, according to sociologist Alvin John Schmidt.<ref>Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced'', ''op. cit.'', p. 124 and see pp. 124<U+2013>129.</ref> The religious [[Ten Commandments|Commandment]] against coveting one's neighbor's wife has as part of its basis that "the wife is definitely seen as property", wrote Schmidt.<ref name="VeilSilence-p126">Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced'', ''op. cit.'', p. 126.</ref> Christians and earlier [[Hebrews]] were, according to Schmidt, influenced by the belief that "woman [was] ... unequal to man",<ref>Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 128<U+2013>129 (quoting p. 129).</ref> producing "sexist theology".<ref>Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced'', ''op. cit.'', p. 129 (''sexism'' defined by author as "an attitude, belief, or practice that subordinates an individual or group on the basis of sex", per ''id.'', p. xvii (''Introduction'')).</ref> Schmidt argued that teachers of [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition who teach on this Commandment "without drawing attention to the property concept of woman"<ref name="VeilSilence-p126" /> "might [be] ... unknowingly contributing to sexual inequality."<ref name="VeilSilence-p126" /> Inequality and inferiority are, according to Schmidt, "negative".<ref>Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced'', ''op. cit.'', p. xiv and see p. xv (both in ''Introduction'').</ref>

Wife selling was criticized by [[Pope Gregory VII]] in the 11th century,<ref>Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced'', ''op. cit.'', p. 128 & n. 34, citing von Hefele, Carl Joseph, ''Conciliengeschichte'', ''op. cit.'', p. 19.</ref> although at other times the [[Christian Church|Christian church]] supported it.<ref>Schmidt, Alvin John, ''Veiled and Silenced'', ''op. cit.'', p. 128 & nn. 35<U+2013>36, citing Menefee, Samuel Pyeatt, ''Wives for Sale'' (N.Y.: St. Martin's Press, 1981), pp. 56 & 140.</ref>
