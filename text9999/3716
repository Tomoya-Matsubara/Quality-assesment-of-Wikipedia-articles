'''Osborne Earl "Ozzie" Smith''' (born December 26, 1954) is a retired American professional [[baseball]] player who was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2002. Nicknamed "The Wizard", Smith played [[shortstop]] for the [[San Diego Padres]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in [[Major League Baseball]], winning the [[National League]] [[Gold Glove Award]] for defensive play at shortstop for 13 consecutive seasons. A 15-time [[All-Star]], Smith accumulated 2,460 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] and 580 [[stolen base]]s during his career, and won the National League [[Silver Slugger Award]] as the best hitter at shortstop in 1987.

Smith was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]], but his family moved to the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] section of [[Los Angeles, California]] when he was six years old. Developing quick reflexes via childhood athletic activities, Smith played baseball in high school and college. Drafted as an amateur player by the San Diego Padres, Smith made his Major League Baseball debut in 1978. Smith quickly established himself as an outstanding defensive player, who later became known for performing backflips on special occasions while running out to his position. Smith won his first Gold Glove award in 1980 and made his first All-Star Game appearance in 1981. When conflict with Padres' ownership developed, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for shortstop [[Garry Templeton]] in 1982.<ref name="wizard3536"/>

Upon joining the Cardinals, Smith helped the team win the [[1982 World Series]] championship. Three years later his game-winning [[home run]] during Game 5 of the [[1985 National League Championship Series]] prompted broadcaster [[Jack Buck]]'s "Go crazy, folks!" play-by-play call. Despite a [[rotator cuff]] injury during the 1985 season, Smith posted career highs in multiple offensive categories in 1987. Smith continued to earn Gold Gloves and All-Star appearances on an annual basis until 1993, and later missed nearly three months of the 1995 season after undergoing shoulder surgery. After tension between Smith and his new manager [[Tony La Russa]] developed in 1996, Smith decided to retire at season's end, and subsequently had his uniform number (#1) retired by the Cardinals.<ref name="sportingnews"/> Smith served as host the television show ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' from 1997 to 1999, and continues to be an entrepreneur in a variety of business ventures.

==San Diego Padres==
Smith was playing semi-professional baseball in [[Clarinda, Iowa]] in June 1976 when he was selected in the seventh round of the [[Major League Baseball Draft|amateur entry draft]] by the [[Detroit Tigers]].<ref name="aol">{{cite web |url=http://sports.aol.com/moresports/story/_a/still-nothing-in-baseball-gets-past/20070731123009990001 |title=Still, Nothing in Baseball Gets Past Ozzie |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Hollander |first=Dave |date=2007-08-08 |publisher=AOL}}</ref><ref name="retrosheet1"/> The parties could not agree on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500.<ref name="aol"/> Smith returned to Cal-Poly for his senior year, then in the 1977 draft was selected in the fourth round by the [[San Diego Padres]], ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus.<ref name="aol"/> Smith spent his first year of professional baseball, 1977, with the Class A [[Walla Walla Padres]] of the [[Northwest League]].<ref name="Hummel85">[[#Hum07|Hummel 2007]]: 57<U+2013>61</ref>

Smith began [[1978 San Diego Padres season|1978]] as a non-roster invitee to the San Diego Padres' spring training camp in [[Yuma, Arizona]]. Smith credited Padres manager [[Alvin Dark]] for giving him confidence by telling reporters the shortstop job was Smith's until he proved he can't handle it.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 17</ref> Even though Dark was fired in the middle of training camp, Smith made his [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) debut on April 7, 1978.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 18</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B04070SFN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 3, San Francisco Giants 2 |accessdate=2007-09-27 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>

It did not take long for Smith to earn recognition in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest defensive play only ten games into his rookie season.<ref name="SI87"/><ref name="USAToday">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/bbw/2002-07-24/cover.htm |title=Go Crazy for the Wizard |last=Colston |first=Chris |date=2002-07-24 |accessdate=2008-05-04 |work=USA Today Baseball Weekly}}</ref> The Padres played host to the [[Atlanta Braves]] on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the top of the fourth [[inning]], Atlanta's [[Jeff Burroughs]] hit a ground ball up the middle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B04200SDN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 2, Atlanta Braves 0 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}</ref> Smith described the play by saying, "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field.

After working with a hitting instructor during the offseason, Smith failed to record a base hit in his first 32 at-bats of the [[1979 San Diego Padres season|1979]] season.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 28<U+2013>31</ref> Off the field, conflict developed between Padres' ownership and the combination of Smith and his agent, Ed Gottlieb. The parties entered into a contract dispute before the [[1980 in baseball|1980 season]], and when negotiations lasted into spring training, the Padres renewed Smith's contract at his 1979 salary of $72,500.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 34</ref> Angered by the Padres' attitude during those contract talks, Gottlieb took out a help-wanted ad in the [[The San Diego Union-Tribune|''San Diego Union'']], part of which read, "Padre baseball player wants part-time employment to supplement income."<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 35</ref> When Joan Kroc, wife of Padres owner [[Ray Kroc]], publicly offered Smith a job as an assistant gardener on her estate, Smith and Gottlieb's relationship with the organization deteriorated further.<ref name="wizard3536">[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 35<U+2013>36</ref>

Meanwhile, Smith was winning recognition for his accomplishments on the field.

===Trade===
While Smith was having problems with the Padres' owners, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop. During a game at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] on August 26, 1981, [[Garry Templeton]] made obscene gestures at fans before being pulled off the field by manager [[Whitey Herzog]].<ref>[[#O'Neill05|O'Neill 2005]]: 108</ref><ref>[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 135<U+2013>136</ref> Given the task of overhauling the Cardinals by owner [[Gussie Busch]], Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager [[Jack McKeon]] at the 1981 [[Winter meetings|baseball winter meetings]].<ref>[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 119<U+2013>120, 137</ref> While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal.<ref name="herzog137">[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 137</ref>

McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece.<ref name="herzog137"/> It was then that Padres manager [[Dick Williams]] informed Herzog that a [[no-trade clause]] had been included in Smith's 1981 contract.<ref>[[#Her99|Herzog and Pitts 1999]]: 92<U+2013>93</ref> Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in [[San Diego]], but he was still interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 51</ref> While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday.<ref>[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 138</ref> Smith later recalled that, "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be."<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 52</ref>

==St. Louis Cardinals==
===1982 season===
[[Image:Ozzie Smith statue part.jpg|right|thumb|Part of Smith's statue outside [[Busch Stadium]] in St. Louis]]
After more behind-the-scenes contract wrangling, Smith became a St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 57</ref> Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool designed to help Smith concentrate on that task.<ref>[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 28<U+2013>29</ref> Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year."<ref name="page61">[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 61</ref> Smith agreed to the wager, and by the end of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog.<ref name="page61"/> As the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|1982 season]] got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/VSLN01982.htm |title=The 1982 St. Louis Cardinals Regular Season Game Log |accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}</ref><ref>[[#Lea08|Leach 2008]]: 37</ref> Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense."<ref>[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 6</ref>

Smith became a father for the first time during the 1982 season with the birth of his son O.J., today known as [[Nikko Smith|Nikko]], on April 28.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 65</ref> Smith also developed a lasting friendship with teammate [[Willie McGee]] during the season, and Smith said he likes to think he "helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues".<ref name="page66">[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 66</ref> Smith later participated in the postseason for the first time when the Cardinals faced the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the best-of-five [[1982 National League Championship Series]] (NLCS). Smith drove in the series' first run by hitting a [[sacrifice fly]] that scored McGee in Game 1, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis' three-game series sweep.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/B10070SLN1982.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals 7, Atlanta Braves 0 |accessdate=2007-10-15 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>

Just as Herzog had predicted when he told Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant with him on the team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven [[1982 World Series]]. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field.<ref>[[#Rai03|Rains 2003]]: 105</ref> When St. Louis was trailing 3<U+2013>1 with one out in the sixth inning of [[1982 World Series#Game 7|Game 7]], Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/B10200SLN1982.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals 6, Milwaukee Brewers 2 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}</ref> After [[Bruce Sutter]] struck out [[Gorman Thomas]] in the ninth inning, Smith celebrated a World Series championship with his teammates.

===Go crazy, folks===
After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals agreed on a new contract in January [[1983 St. Louis Cardinals season|1983]] that paid Smith $1 million per year.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 81</ref> Smith was voted in as the National League's starting shortstop in the [[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] for the first time in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award.<ref>[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 87</ref> During July of the [[1984 St. Louis Cardinals season|1984 season]], Smith went on the [[disabled list]] with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres.<ref name="page95">[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 95</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1984/B07130SLN1984.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals 7, San Diego Padres 4 |accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}</ref> Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.<ref name="page95"/>
