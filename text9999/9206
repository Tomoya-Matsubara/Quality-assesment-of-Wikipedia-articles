'''''Fritillaria liliacea''''', commonly known as '''Fragrant Fritillary''', is a [[threatened]] [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herb]] in the [[Liliaceae]] family, in [[California]].  

==Distribution==
The range of this wildflower is over parts of southwestern [[Northern California]], [[USA]], especially [[Solano County|Solano]] and [[Sonoma County|Sonoma Counties]] and at coastal locations south to [[Monterey County]];  occurrence is typically in open hilly [[grassland]]s at altitudes less than 200 meters in elevation.<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?8349,8560,8573 ''Jepson Manual'', University of California Press (1993)]</ref> 

This California [[endemism|endemic]] has been a candidate for listing as a U.S. Federally [[endangered species]], and some of the remaining fragmented colonies are at risk of local [[extinction]], such that the species is considered locally endangered.  Example occurrences are: [[Edgewood Park]] in [[San Mateo County]] and the [[Sonoma Mountains]] foothills in [[Sonoma County]].  Examples of highly fragmented or extirpated colonies are in [[San Francisco]] due to urban development. 

==Description==
The bell-shaped white flowers have greenish stripes and are set on a nodding [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] of about 37 centimeters in height.  The blossoms are odorless to faintly fragrant.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=113029 Flora of North America: "Fritillia key tree"]</ref>      ''F. liliacea'' prefers heavy soils including clays; for example, [[andesite|andesitic]] and [[basalt]]ic soils derived from the Sonoma [[Volcanic]] soil layers are suitable substrate for this species.<ref>C.Michael Hogan, John Torrey, Brian McElroy et al., ''Environmental Impact Report, Southeast Santa Rosa Annexation 2-88'', Earth Metrics Inc., Report 7941, California State Clearinghouse, Sacramento, Ca., March 1990</ref>
