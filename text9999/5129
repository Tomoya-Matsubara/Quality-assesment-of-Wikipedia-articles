'''Luigi Maglione''' ([[2 March]], [[1877]]&mdash;[[23 August]], [[1944]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He served as the [[Cardinal Secretary of State|Vatican Secretary of State]] under [[Pope Pius XII]] from [[1939]] until his death, and was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] in [[1935]]. Pius XII never replaced Maglione as Secretary of State after his death, opting to personally assume the responsibilities of the office himself, with the assistance of two undersecretaries.

==Early career and education==
Born in [[Casoria]], Maglione was educated at the ''Collegio Capranica'' and [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], from where he obtained [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorates in philosophy]] and [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|theology]], in [[Rome]]. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] on [[25 July]], [[1901]], and then did [[Parish (Catholic Church)|pastoral]] work in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Naples|Archdiocese of Naples]] until [[1903]].

Maglione studied at the [[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy]] from [[1905]] to [[1907]]; he later taught there from [[1915]] to [[1918]]. He served an official of the [[Cardinal Secretary of State|Vatican Secretariat of State]] from [[1908]] to 1918, rising to become a [[Monsignor|Privy Chamberlain]] ([[17 June]], [[1910]]) and a [[Monsignor|Domestic Prelate]] ([[22 February]], [[1918]]). He was also a provisional [[Pope|papal]] representative to the [[League of Nations]] and a special papal envoy to [[Switzerland]].

==Nunciatures==
On [[1 September]], [[1920]], Maglione was appointed [[Nuncio]] to Switzerland and [[Titular bishop|Titular Archbishop]] of ''[[Archbishop of Caesarea|Cesarea di Palestina]]'' by [[Pope Benedict XV]]. He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|epsicopal consecration]] on the following [[26 September]] from [[Pietro Cardinal Gasparri]], with Archbishops [[Bonaventura Cerretti]] and [[Lorenzo Schioppa]] serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]], in the [[Churches of Rome|church]] of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]. Archbishop Maglione was later named [[Apostolic Nuncio to France]] on [[23 June]], [[1926]]. Upon his arrival in France he was resentfully considered pro-[[Germany|German]], but had become so liked by the [[Government of France|French government]] before he left the post that he was reported to have had a hand in forming the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]].<ref>TIME Magazine.

==Cardinal Secretary of State==
[[Pope Pius XI]] created him [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[Santa Pudenziana|S. Pudenziana]]'' in the [[consistory]] of [[16 December]], [[1935]], and then [[Prefect]] of the [[Congregation for the Clergy|Sacred Congregation of the Council]] on [[22 July]], [[1938]]. Cardinal Maglione was one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1939|cardinal electors]] who participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1939|1939 papal conclave]], which selected [[Pope Pius XII]]. Pius XII, who was a former schoolmate of Maglione's, tapped Maglione to succeed him as [[Cardinal Secretary of State|Vatican Secretary of State]] on [[10 March]], [[1939]].

His tenure as Secretary of State included most of [[World War II]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], much of his work being documented in the eleven volumes of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s wartime documents, ''[[Actes et Documents du Saint Si<U+00E8>ge relatifs <U+00E0> la Seconde Guerre Mondiale]]''. After falling under [[Occupation of the Baltic republics by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation]], [[Lithuania]] appealed to the Vatican to reintegrate its [[diocese]]s into the country and replace its bishops, to which Maglione responded, "The government of [[Kaunas]] should appreciate, that the Holy See cannot run behind armies and change bishops as combatant troops occupy new territories belonging to countries other than their own."<ref>Blet 73</ref>

Cardinal Maglione died a year before the war's end in his native Casoria, from [[neuritis]] and [[Circulatory system|circulatory]] ailments. Upon his death, Pius XII assumed the duties of the office himself, with assistance from [[Domenico Tardini]] and [[Pope Paul VI|Giovanni Battista Montini]].

He vigorously defended Pius's wartime diplomacy, once declaring, "If you ask why the documents sent by the Pontiff to the [[Poland|Polish]] bishops haven not been made public, know that it seems better in the Vatican to follow the same norms, the Polish bishops themselves follow...Isn<U+2019>t this what has to be done? Should the father of  Christianity increase the misfortunes of Poles in their own country?"<ref>Blet 84</ref> The relationship between Maglione and the Pontiff was so close that Italians were known to joke that whenever Pius went out without his ''maglione'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "large [[sweater]]"), he caught cold.<ref>TIME Magazine.
