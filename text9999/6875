The Calendar of the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] is published in '''An Anglican Prayer Book 1989'''.<ref> {{cite book  | last = The Provincial Trustees of the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] | title = An Anglican Prayer Book 1989 | publisher = Collins Liturgical Publications | date = 1989   | pages = pp. 17-33 | isbn = 0-00-599180-3 }}</ref>

The Preface to the calendar in the Prayer Book describes its purpose: The Church's Year both commemorates and proclaims how God came down from heaven to earth in Jesus Christ, who still lives among us by the Holy Spirit until he comes again at the end of time. The yearly observance of the holy days of the Calendar is a celebration of what God has done and is doing for our salvation. 

Holy Days are distinguished as '''Great Festivals''' (being the principal celebrations), '''Festivals''' (celebrating New Testament events), '''Commemorations''' (recalling particular individuals and events), and other '''Special Days''' - the observance of the former taking precedence over the latter in the event of clashes. The Preface to the calendar describes the commemorations as occasions: when the Church thankfully recalls the work and witness of men and women through whom Christ's saving victory has been manifested from the time of the [[apostles]] to the present day.

== Great Festivals ==
