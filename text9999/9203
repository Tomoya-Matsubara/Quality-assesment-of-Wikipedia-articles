'''Byron MacGregor''' (March 3, 1948 &ndash; January 3, 1995)<ref>[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1995.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] Accessed April 2010</ref> was a [[Canada|Canadian]] news anchor and news director.

==Career==
Born '''Gary Lachlan Mack''' in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], by the age of nineteen he became the youngest news director at the [[AM radio]] [[radio station|station]], [[CKLW]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], which also served [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] as well as [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] in [[Ohio]] and covered twenty eight states and six provinces. This was during its "Big 8/20<U+00B7>20 News" period, and also around the time [[RKO General]] was forced to sell the station, due to a change in Canadian ownership rules that prohibited foreign firms from controlling Canadian licensed stations.<ref>{{YouTube|BDCdbmwy9l8|CKLW's 20/20 News Team}}</ref>

In 1973, he read a Toronto newspaper editorial written by [[Gordon Sinclair]] of [[CFRB]] in [[Toronto]], a [[The Americans (commentary)|commentary about America]]. MacGregor then read the patriotic commentary on CKLW Radio as part of a public affairs program; and, due to the huge response he was asked to record "The Americans" with "[[America the Beautiful]]" performed by The [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] as the background music. Both MacGregor and Sinclair released recorded versions of the commentary. MacGregor's version of the record (released on [[Westbound Records]]) became a bigger hit than Sinclair's in the [[United States]], reaching #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] the week of February 9, 1974.<ref>Joel Whitburn, ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''. 7th Edition, 2000</ref> In Canada, MacGregor's version hit #1, while Sinclair's hit #24. His recording has sold over three and a half million copies,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

MacGregor was known for his deep voice and high-energy announcing style at CKLW;  and for writing copy in a manner that was compared to that of sensational tabloid newspapers. He later made the transition to a more traditional anchoring and interviewing style when he moved to WWJ Newsradio 950, the CBS Radio all-news station in Detroit, where he served as both morning and afternoon drive anchor during his thirteen-year occupancy.  MacGregor  also became the first newsman in Detroit to simultaneously anchor prime-time newscasts on both radio (WWJ) and television (WKBD-TV 50).

By the mid 1980s MacGregor held dual citizenships in Canada and the United States. He died on January 3, 1995. His funeral took place at the McCabe Funeral Home in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] and at the Shrine of the Little Flower Catholic Church in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.thebig8.net/byron.html The Classic CKLW Page - Memoirs of Byron's Funeral]</ref> He was 46 years old and left his wife of nineteen years, Jo-Jo Shutty-MacGregor. She was the first female helicopter news and traffic reporter in [[North America]], and today works for [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] and [[WOMC]] and the Metro News Networks. MacGregor was also survived by his sister, Leilani Harvie, by his Mother, Murdena MacGregor Mack, and by his brother, [[Hudson Mack]], who is currently news anchor at [[CIVI-TV]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].
