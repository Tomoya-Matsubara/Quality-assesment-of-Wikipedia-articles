'''Sibyl de Neufmarch<U+00E9>''', Countess of Hereford, ''[[suo jure]]'' Lady of Brecknock ([[circa|c.]]&nbsp;1100 &ndash; after 1143), was a [[Cambro-Norman]] [[Nobility|noblewoman]], heiress to one of the most substantial [[fief]]s in the [[Welsh Marches]]. The great-granddaughter of [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], king of Wales, Sibyl was also connected to the nobility of England and Normandy. 
Sibyl inherited the titles and lands of her father, [[Bernard de Neufmarch<U+00E9>]], Lord of [[Brecon]], after her mother, Nest ferch Osbern, had declared her brother Mahel to have been illegitimate. Most of these estates passed to Sibyl's husband, [[Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford]], as her [[dowry]]. Their marriage had been arranged personally by [[Henry I of England|King Henry I of England]] in the spring of 1121. Sibyl, with her extensive lands, was  central to the King's plans of consolidating [[Anglo-Norman]] power in south-east Wales by the merging of her estates with those of Miles, his loyal subject on whom he relied to implement [[The Crown|Crown]] policy. 

As an adult, Sibyl lived through [[Stephen of England|King Stephen's]] turbulent reign, known to history as [[the Anarchy]], in which her husband played a pivotal role. Following Miles' accidental death in 1143, Sibyl entered a religious life at [[Llanthony Secunda|Llanthony Secunda Priory]], Gloucestershire, England, which she had endowed up to six years previously. Sibyl is buried at the priory, founded by Miles in 1136.

===Inheritance===
Sibyl had two brothers, Philip, who most likely died young, and Mahel. Nest had Mahel disinherited by swearing to King Henry I of England that Mahel had been fathered by another man. According to [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], this was done out of vengeance when Mahel had multilated Nest's lover, a knight whose identity is not disclosed.<ref name="Gerallt"/> In the 19th century, [[Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward]] proposed that, after Bernard's death, Nest "disgraced herself with an intrigue" with one of his soldiers. Mahel, who had by this time inherited Bernard's estates, disapproved of the liaison to such an extent that he killed Nest's lover. Nest's revenge was to have Mahel disinherited by claiming that Bernard was not Mahel's father.<ref name=" Woodward 1">{{cite book|last=Woodward |first=Bernard Bolingbroke |authorlink = Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward |title =History of Wales|publisher=[[James Sprent Virtue|James S.

By arranging a series of matrimonial alliances, similar to that between Sibyl and Miles, King Henry I of England transformed "the map of territorial power in south-east Wales".

==The Anarchy==
[[File:Stepan Blois.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Medieval illumination|<center>    [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]]<br>whose chaotic reign in England became known as [[the Anarchy]]</center>]]
After Henry I's death in 1135, the throne of England was seized by [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], a grandson of William I of England. Henry's daughter, [[Empress Matilda]] (Maud), also claimed the throne, and had the support of the Marcher Lords. On the death of her husband, the [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V]], in 1125, Matilda had returned to England for the first time in 16 years. At the insistence of her father, the [[Baron#Barons in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|barons]] (including Stephen) swore to uphold Matilda's rights as his heir. Matilda married [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] in 1128. They lived together in France, having three sons; the eldest of whom was to become King [[Henry II of England]].<ref name="Matthew scene">{{cite book |last=Matthew |first=Donald |author-link= |title=King Stephen|pages=1<U+2013>2 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=2002 |location=London |isbn=1-85285-272-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d_Uw7fhx82cC&pg=PA1&dq=Scene-setting+intitle:King+intitle:Stephen&hl=en&ei=fqPOTMbTBcjAswalwa2XCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Scene-setting%20intitle%3AKing%20intitle%3AStephen&f=false |accessdate=22&nbsp;October 2010}}</ref> Initially, Miles supported Stephen.

[[Llanthony Priory]] had been established near [[Llanvihangel Crucorney|Crucorney]], in the [[Vale of Ewyas]], in 1118; Wales' earliest [[Augustine]] monastery. Miles' father, [[Walter de Gloucester]], had retired there by 1126.<ref name="Walker 67"/> The unrest that had been simmering in Wales during the last years of Henry's reign, boiled over in 1135 on his death.

[[File:Empress matilda.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Medieval illumination|<center>[[Empress Matilda]]<br>whom Sibyl supported<br>in opposition to [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]]</center>]]
Miles transferred his allegiance to Empress Matilda, on her return to England in 1139.<ref name="Matthew scene"/> According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, and the necessity of joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs.<ref name="Keats-Rohan"/> Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian [[Ralph Henry Carless Davis|R.H.C. Davis]], possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford.<ref name="Regesta">{{cite book|last=Davis |first=H W C |authorlink=Ralph Henry Carless Davis |editor1-last=Johnson |editor1-first=Charles |editor1-link= |editor2-last=cronne |editor2-first=H A |editorlink2= |title=Regesta Regum Anglo-Noermanorum |volume=regesta henricui primi 1100-1135 |page=xvi |publisher=BiblioBazaar LLC |year=2009 |location=Oxford |isbn=1-115-38714-9 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (9) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JFU7QRsjFI4C&pg=PR16&dq=Miles+%22Constable+of+England%22&hl=en&ei=_iXLTLz8B4rFswbT4cGnAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Miles%20%22Constable%20of%20England%22&f=false |accessdate=28&nbsp;October 2010}}</ref> He also received [[St. Briavels]] Castle and the [[Forest of Dean]]. At the time Matilda was the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at [[Bristol]] following his capture the previous February after the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]]. Sibyl was styled '''Countess of Hereford''', until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from [[Brien FitzCount]], the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke [[Alan IV of Brittany]]. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of [[Wallingford Castle|Wallingford]] during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer.<ref>Cawley, Charles (2010). ''Medieval Lands, Brittany''.</ref>

During [[the Anarchy]], which the period of Stephen's reign as King of England was to become known, life was greatly disrupted in her husband's lands. Sibyl would have doubtless suffered as a result, especially after Miles' decision to support Matilda's claim to the throne and to oppose Stephen.<ref name="Matthew 96">{{cite book |last=Matthew |first=Donald |author-link= |title=King Stephen |page=96 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |year=2002 |location=London |isbn=1-85285-272-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d_Uw7fhx82cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=King+Stephen&hl=en&ei=xaPBTKPlM8uUswbyiKmZCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=25&nbsp;October 2010}}</ref> When Matilda was defeated at [[Winchester]] in late 1141, Miles was compelled to return to [[Gloucester]] in disgrace: "weary, half-naked and alone".<ref name="Companion">{{cite book |last=Arnold-Baker |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Arnold-Baker |title=The companion to British history |page=581 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |edition=2nd |year=2001 |location=London |isbn=0-415-18583-1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VNAMjuMw_5kC&pg=PA581&dq=%22Gloucester,+Miles+of%22&hl=en&ei=123FTNqlFoOTswbki7XSCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Gloucester%2C%20Miles%20of%22&f=false |accessdate=25&nbsp;October 2010}}</ref> In November of that same year, Stephen was released from prison and restored to the English throne.<ref name="Matthew"/> 

Sibyl's distress would have been heightened in 1143 after the [[Bishop of Hereford]], [[Robert de Bethune]] placed an [[interdict]] upon [[Herefordshire|Hereford]], blocked all the [[Hereford Cathedral|cathedral's]] entrances with thorns, and [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] Miles.

==Sibyl's legacy==
  
Upon the childless death of Roger in 1155, the [[Earl of Hereford|Earldom of Hereford]] fell into abeyance until 1199 when [[John of England|King John]] bestowed the title on [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford|Henry de Bohun]], Sibyl's grandson through her eldest daughter, Margaret. As her sons all died without legitimate offspring, Sibyl's three daughters became co-heirs to the Brecon honour, with Bertha, the second daughter, passing Sibyl's inheritance on (through marriage) to the de Braoses, thereby making them one of the most powerful families in the Welsh Marches.<ref name="White Reform">{{cite book|last=White |first=Graeme J |author-link= |title= Restoration and Reform, 1153-1165: Recovery From Civil War in England |page=109 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2000|location=London |isbn=0-521-55459-6 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uWV3vL0CUZEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Restoration+intitle:and+intitle:Reform+intitle:1153-1165+intitle:Recovery+intitle:From+intitle:Civil+intitle:War+intitle:in+intitle:England&hl=en&ei=8B7QTKa4EdHCswbojp3yAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=19&nbsp;October 2010}}</ref><ref name="Breconshire quote">{{cite book |last=Evans  |first=Christopher J |author-link= |title=Breconshire  |page=81 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1912 |location=Cambridge |quote=<U+201C>Four of his [Milo's] sons succeeded him, but as they died without male heirs, their possessions went by marriage to Philip de Breos of Builth, the husband of their second sister.<U+201D> |isbn=  |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=lPM8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA81&dq=Sibyl+Brecon+Castle&hl=en&ei=B8zGTNzdO4LNswaMhKGMDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=26&nbsp;October 2010}}</ref>

The Brecknock lordship would eventually go to the de Bohuns, by way of [[Eleanor de Braose]]. Eleanor, a descendant of Sibyl's through Bertha of Hereford, married Humphrey de Bohun, son of the [[Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford|2nd Earl of Hereford]]. Eleanor and Humphrey's son, [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]], succeeded his grandfather to the titles in 1275.<ref name="FMG Bohun">{{cite web|url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/ENGLISH%20NOBILITY%20MEDIEVAL.htm#HumphreyBohunHereforddied1298A |title=English Earls 1067-1122|author=Charles Cawley |publisher=Charles Cawley and the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy |year=2010 | work=Medieval Lands Project | accessdate=4&nbsp;November 2010}}</ref>

Through the advantageous marriages of her daughters, Sibyl was an ancestress of many of England and Ireland's noblest families including among others, the de Bohun's, de Beauchamps, Mortimers, Fitzalans, de Burghs, de Lacy's, and Bonvilles. Four of her descendants, [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford]], [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster]], [[Eleanor de Bohun]], and [[Mary de Bohun]] married into the [[English royal family]], while another, [[Anne Mortimer]] was the grandmother of [[House of York|Yorkist]] kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. By way of Edward's daughter, [[Elizabeth of York]], every monarch of England and, subsequently, the United Kingdom, from [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] up to and including [[Elizabeth II]], descended in a direct line from Sibyl de Neufmarch<U+00E9>, as did the various royal sovereigns of Europe who shared  a common descent from [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref name="FMG Kings">{{cite web|url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/ENGLAND,%20Kings%201066-1603.htm |title=England Kings |author=Charles Cawley |publisher=Charles Cawley and the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy |year=2010 | work=Medieval Lands Project | accessdate=5&nbsp;November 2010}}</ref>
