'''Joseph-Maurice Ravel''' (7 March 1875 <U+2013> 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with [[impressionism in music|impressionism]] along with his elder contemporary [[Claude Debussy]], although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 30s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer.

Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the [[Paris Conservatoire]]; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of [[baroque music|baroque]], [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]] and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, ''[[Bol<U+00E9>ro]]'' (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' is the best known.

As a slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed  fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas, and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or religious works. Many of his works exist in two versions: a first, piano score and a later orchestration. Some of his piano music, such as ''[[Gaspard de la nuit]]'' (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as ''[[Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>]]'' (1912) require skilful balance in performance.

Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
[[File:Ravel-and-parents.jpg|alt=head-and=shoulder shots of bearded man, youngish woman and small child|thumb|Joseph Ravel (1875), Marie Ravel (1870) and Maurice Ravel aged four (1879)]]
Ravel was born in the [[Northern Basque Country|Basque]] town of [[Ciboure]], France, near [[Biarritz]], {{convert|18|km|mi}} from the Spanish border. His father, [[Pierre-Joseph Ravel]], was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in [[Versoix]] near the Franco-Swiss border.<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 1</ref>{{#tag:ref|Joseph's family is described in some sources as French and in others as Swiss; Versoix is in present-day (2015) Switzerland, but as the historian Philippe Morant observes, the nationality of families from the area changed several times over the generations as borders were moved; Joseph held a French passport,<ref name=n390>Nichols (2011), p. 390</ref> but Ravel preferred to say simply that his paternal ancestors came from the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]].<ref>''Quoted'' in Nichols (2011), p. 3</ref>|group= n}} His mother, Marie, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Delouart, was [[Basque people|Basque]] but had grown up in Madrid. In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status <U+2013> Marie was illegitimate and barely literate <U+2013> but the marriage was a happy one.<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 6</ref> Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early [[internal combustion engine]] and a notorious circus machine, the "Whirlwind of Death", an automotive loop-the-loop that was a big draw until a fatal accident at [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus|Barnum and Bailey's Circus]] in 1903.<ref>James, p. 13</ref>

Both Ravel's parents were [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]; Marie was also something of a [[Freethought|free-thinker]], a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 9</ref> He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, <U+00C9>douard, was born. He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.<ref name="Orenstein, 1991, p. 8"/> Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him.<ref name="Orenstein, 1991, p. 8">Orenstein (1991), p. 8</ref> The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.<ref>Orenstein (1995), pp. 91<U+2013>92</ref>

Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 10</ref> In later life, Ravel recalled, "Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music. My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age."<ref>''Quoted'' in Goss, p. 23</ref> There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father.<ref name=n9/>

When he was seven Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of [[Emmanuel Chabrier]]; five years later, in 1887, he began studying [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and composition with Charles-Ren<U+00E9>, a pupil of [[L<U+00E9>o Delibes]].<ref name=n9>Nichols (2011), p. 9</ref> Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy.<ref>Goss, p. 23</ref> Charles-Ren<U+00E9> found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him "and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort".<ref>Goss, p. 24</ref> Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], variations on a theme by [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] and a single movement of a piano sonata.<ref name=grove>Kelly, Barbara L.

In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist [[Ricardo Vi<U+00F1>es]], who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music.<ref>James, p. 15</ref> The two shared an appreciation of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], Russian music, and the writings of [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], and [[St<U+00E9>phane Mallarm<U+00E9>|Mallarm<U+00E9>]].<ref name="Orenstein, 1991, p. 16">Orenstein (1991), p. 16</ref> At the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the [[Russian Symphony Concerts|new Russian works]] conducted by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].<ref>Orenstein (1991), pp. 11<U+2013>12; and Nichols (2011), pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref> This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary [[Claude Debussy]], as did the exotic sound of the Javanese [[gamelan]], also heard during the Exposition.<ref name=grove/>

[[<U+00C9>mile Decombes]] took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance.<ref name=ln9>Lesure and Nectoux, p. 9</ref> Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Erard along with other pupils of Decombes, including [[Reynaldo Hahn]] and [[Alfred Cortot]].<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 11</ref>

===Paris Conservatoire===
With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. In November 1889, playing music by [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]], he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eug<U+00E8>ne Anthi<U+00F2>me.<ref>Nichols (2011), pp. 11 and 390</ref> Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student.<ref name=o92>Orenstein (1995), p. 92</ref>   Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer. The musicologist [[Arbie Orenstein]] writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period "of immense growth{{space}}... from adolescence to maturity." <ref name="Orenstein, 1991, p. 14">Orenstein (1991), p. 14</ref>
[[File:Classe B<U+00E9>riot 1895.jpg|thumb|left|alt=outdoor group photograph of a small class of students with their professor|upright=1.25|Piano class of [[Charles-Wilfrid de B<U+00E9>riot|Charles de B<U+00E9>riot]] in 1895, with Ravel on the left]]
In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of [[Charles-Wilfrid de B<U+00E9>riot]], for piano, and [[<U+00C9>mile Pessard]], for harmony.<ref name=ln9/> He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from B<U+00E9>riot, but in the words of the musical scholar Barbara L Kelly, he "was only teachable on his own terms".<ref name=k2/> His later teacher [[Gabriel Faur<U+00E9>]] understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s.<ref name=k2>Kelly (2000), p. 7</ref> Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes.{{#tag:ref|Students who failed in three consecutive years to win a competitive medal were automatically expelled ("faute de r<U+00E9>compense") from their course.<ref name=ln9/><ref>Nichols (2011), p. 14</ref>|group= n}} His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: ''S<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>nade grotesque'', for piano, and "Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer"{{#tag:ref|"Ballad of the queen who died of love"|group= n}}, a ''[[m<U+00E9>lodie]]'' setting a poem by Rolande de Mar<U+00E8>s (both 1893).<ref name=grove/>

Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Vi<U+00F1>es and Cortot were.{{#tag:ref|When he was a boy his mother had occasionally had to bribe him to do his piano exercises,<ref name=o92/> and throughout his life colleagues commented on his aversion to practice.<ref>Nichols (1987), pp. 73 and 91</ref>|group= n}} It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer.<ref>Orenstein (1995), p. 92</ref> From this point he concentrated on composition. His works from the period include the songs "Un grand sommeil noir" and "D'Anne jouant de l'espinette" to words by [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Cl<U+00E9>ment Marot]],<ref name=grove/>{{#tag:ref|Respectively, "A great black sleep" and "Anne playing the [[spinet]]".|group= n}}    and the piano pieces ''[[Menuet antique]]'' and ''Habanera'', the latter eventually incorporated into the ''[[Rapsodie espagnole]]''.<ref>Jank<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vitch, pp. 8 and 20</ref> At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to [[Erik Satie]], who was earning a living as a caf<U+00E9> pianist. Ravel was one of the first musicians <U+2013> Debussy was another <U+2013> who recognised Satie's originality and talent.<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 183</ref> Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them "of inestimable value".<ref>''Quoted'' in Orenstein (1991), p. 33</ref>

In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Faur<U+00E9>, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with [[Andr<U+00E9> Gedalge]].<ref name=ln9/> Both these teachers, particularly Faur<U+00E9>, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer.<ref name=grove/> As Ravel's course progressed, Faur<U+00E9> reported "a distinct gain in maturity{{space}}... engaging wealth of imagination".<ref>Nichols (1977), pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, [[Th<U+00E9>odore Dubois]], who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook.<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 35; and Orenstein (1991), p. 26</ref> Consequently, according to a fellow-student, [[Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi]], he was "a marked man, against whom all weapons were good".<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 178</ref> He wrote some substantial works while studying with Faur<U+00E9>, including the overture ''[[Sh<U+00E9>h<U+00E9>razade (Ravel)|Sh<U+00E9>h<U+00E9>razade]]'' and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900. As a former student he was allowed to attend Faur<U+00E9>'s classes as a non-participating "auditeur" until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903.<ref>Nichols (1977), p. 15</ref>

In 1889 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: ''[[Pavane pour une infante d<U+00E9>funte]]'' ("[[Pavane]] for a dead princess").<ref name=bbc>[[Richard Langham Smith|Langham Smith, Richard]].

===Les Apaches and Debussy===
 {{Listen|title=Pavane pour une infante d<U+00E9>funte|filename=Maurice Ravel - Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Dussaut - Pavane pour une infante d<U+00E9>funte.ogg|description=Performed by Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Dussaut.}}
In 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics, and musicians joined together in an informal group, calling themselves [[Les Apaches]] ("The Hooligans"), a name coined by Vi<U+00F1>es to represent their status as "artistic outcasts".<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 28</ref> They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one other with intellectual argument and performances of their works. The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Manuel de Falla]] as well as their French friends.{{#tag:ref|Other members were the composers [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Maurice Delage]] and [[Paul Ladmirault]], the poets [[L<U+00E9>on-Paul Fargue]] and [[Tristan Klingsor]], the painter [[Paul Sordes]] and the critic [[Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi|Michel Calvocoressi]].<ref>Pasler, p. 403; Nichols (1977), p. 20; and Orenstein (1991), p. 28</ref>|group= n}}

Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years.<ref name=n101>Nichols (1987), p. 101</ref> In 1902 [[Andr<U+00E9> Messager]] conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera'' [[Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande (opera)|Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande]]'' at the [[Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique]]. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher [[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]] was prominent among those who detested the piece.<ref>Orledge, p. 65 (Dubois); and Donnellon, pp. 8<U+2013>9 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)</ref> The Apaches were loud in their support.<ref>McAuliffe, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.<ref>McAuliffe, p. 58</ref>

[[File:Debussy-Nadar-1905.jpg|thumb|alt=head and shoulder image of bearded man of middle age, seen in right profile|left|upright|[[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] in 1905]]
Debussy was widely held to be an [[impressionism in music|impressionist]] composer <U+2013> a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre.<ref>James, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref> Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not.<ref name=k16>Kelly (2000), p. 16</ref>{{#tag:ref|Ravel later came to the view that "impressionism" was not a suitable term for any music, and was essentially relevant only to painting.<ref>Orenstein (2003), p. 421</ref>|group= n}} Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship.<ref name="Orenstein, 1991, p. 127">Orenstein (1991), p. 127</ref> Ravel wrote that Debussy's "genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy{{space}}... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [his] [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]".<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 33; and James, p. 20</ref> During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece ''Jeux d'eau''{{#tag:ref|Literally "Games of water", sometimes translated as "Fountains"|group= n}} (1901), the [[String Quartet (Ravel)|String Quartet]] and the orchestral song cycle ''Sh<U+00E9>h<U+00E9>razade'' (both 1903).<ref name=landormy431/> Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet "at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence".<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 52</ref>

The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons. Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other. Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom.<ref name=n101/> Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, "Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people."<ref name=James46/> The public tension led to personal estrangement.<ref name=James46>James, p. 46</ref> Ravel said, "It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons."<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 102</ref> Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift. In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer [[Emma Bardac]]. Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante [[Misia Sert|Misia Edwards]] and the opera star [[Lucienne Br<U+00E9>val]], contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband.<ref>Nichols (2011), pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref>

During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the [[Prix de Rome]], past winners of which included [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]] and Debussy.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article_works/grove/music/40632#S40632.1 "Winners of the Prix de Rome"], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford University Press, retrieved 27 February 2015 {{subscription}}</ref> In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition.<ref>Macdonald, p. 332</ref> In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies.<ref name=landormy431>Landormy, p. 431</ref>{{#tag:ref|Ravel admitted in 1926 that he had submitted at least one piece deliberately parodying the required conventional form: the cantata ''Myrrha'', which he wrote for the 1901 competition.<ref>Macdonald, p. 332; and Kelly, p. 8</ref>|group = n}} In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a ''furore''.

[[File:Vaughan-Williams-by-Rothenstein.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of youngish man with full head of hair, clean shaven, looking towards the artist |150px|left|[[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], one of Ravel's few pupils]]
Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. [[Manuel Rosenthal]] was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Faur<U+00E9>, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters.<ref>Nichols (2011), pp. 26<U+2013>30; and Pollack, pp. 119<U+2013>120</ref> He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: "Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound."<ref>''Quoted'' in Nichols (1987), p. 67</ref> When [[George Gershwin]] asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity".<ref>Pollack, p. 119</ref>{{#tag:ref|This remark was modified by Hollywood writers for the film ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'' in 1945, in which Ravel (played by Oscar Loraine) tells Gershwin ([[Robert Alda]]) "If you study with me you'll only write second-rate Ravel instead of first-rate Gershwin."<ref>Pollack, p. 728</ref>|group= n}} The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who was his pupil for three months in 1908. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner{{space}}... ''Complexe mais pas compliqu<U+00E9>'' was his motto."<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 68</ref>

Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and [[Marguerite Long]] have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels.<ref>Nichols (1987), pp. 70 (Vaughan Williams), 36 (Rosenthal) and 32 (Long)</ref> Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women.<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 32</ref> By other accounts, none of them first hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards,<ref name=lamaze/> or wanted to marry the violinist H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Jourdan-Morhange.<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 35</ref> Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual.<ref>Nichols (1987), pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref> Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by [[Benjamin Ivry]];<ref>Ivry, p. 4</ref> subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.<ref>Whitesell, p. 78; and Nichols (2011), p. 350</ref>

Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909. As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Concerts Fran<U+00E7>ais, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation.<ref>"Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Concerts Fran<U+00E7>ais", ''The Times'', 27 April 1909, p. 8; and Nichols (2011), pp. 108<U+2013>109</ref>{{#tag:ref|Ravel, known for his gourmet tastes, developed an unexpected enthusiasm for English cooking, particularly [[steak and kidney pudding]] with [[stout]].<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 109</ref>|group= n}}

===1910 to First World War===
The [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nationale de Musique]], founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by [[Vincent d'Indy]].<ref>Strasser, p. 251</ref> Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Faur<U+00E9>, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Musicale Ind<U+00E9>pendente, with Faur<U+00E9> as its president.{{#tag:ref|Faur<U+00E9> also retained the presidency of the rival Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nationale, retaining the affection and respect of members of both bodies, including d'Indy.<ref>Jones, p. 133</ref>|group= n}} The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Faur<U+00E9>'s song cycle ''[[La chanson d'<U+00C8>ve]]'', Debussy's piano suite ''D'un cahier d'esquisses'', [[Zolt<U+00E1>n Kod<U+00E1>ly]]'s ''Six pi<U+00E8>ces pour piano'', and the original piano duet version of Ravel's '' Ma m<U+00E8>re l'Oye''. The performers included Faur<U+00E9>, [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Ernest Bloch]], [[Pierre Monteux]] and, in the Debussy work, Ravel.<ref>"Courrier Musicale", ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 20 April 1910, p. 6</ref> Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911.<ref name=grove/>

The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy ''[[L'heure espagnole]]''{{#tag:ref|"The Spanish Hour"|group= n}} was premiered in 1911. The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique, [[Albert Carr<U+00E9>]], repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot <U+2013> a [[bedroom farce]] <U+2013> would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique's audience.<ref>Kilpatrick, pp. 103<U+2013>104, and 106</ref> The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.<ref>Kilpatrick, p. 132</ref>

In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered. The first, to the orchestrated version of ''Ma m<U+00E8>re l'Oye'', opened at the Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre des Arts in January.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 65</ref> The reviews were excellent: the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' called the score "absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature".<ref>''Quoted'' in Zank, p. 259</ref> The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the [[Queen's Hall]], London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the [[the Proms|Proms]] later in the same year. ''[[The Times]]'' praised "the enchantment of the work&nbsp;... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing."<ref>"Promenade Concerts", ''The Times'', 28 August 1912, p. 7</ref> New York audiences heard the work in the same year.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01E7D9133CE633A2575AC0A9679D946396D6CF "New York Symphony in New Aeolian Hall"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 November 1912 {{subscription}}</ref> Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was ''Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de ou le langage des fleurs'', danced to the score of ''Valses nobles et sentimentales'', which opened at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre du Ch<U+00E2>telet|Ch<U+00E2>telet]] in April. ''[[Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>]]'' opened at the same theatre in June. This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete.<ref>Morrison, pp. 63<U+2013>64; and Nichols (2011), p. 141</ref>

''Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>'' was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]] for his company, the [[Ballets Russes]].{{#tag:ref|The year in which the work was commissioned is generally thought to be 1909, although Ravel recalled it as being as early as 1907.<ref>Morrison, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref>|group= n}} Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, [[Michel Fokine]], and designer, [[L<U+00E9>on Bakst]].<ref>Morrison, p. 54</ref> Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music.<ref>Nichols (1987), pp. 41<U+2013>43</ref> There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work.<ref>Morrison, p. 50</ref> It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 60; and "Return of the Russian Ballet", ''The Times'', 10 June 1914, p. 11</ref> The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health;{{#tag:ref|Ravel wrote to a friend, "I have to tell you that the last week has been insane: preparing a ballet libretto for the next Russian season.

Ravel composed little during 1913. He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s unfinished opera ''[[Khovanshchina]]'', and his own works were the ''Trois po<U+00E8>mes de Mallarm<U+00E9>'' for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, ''<U+00C0> la mani<U+00E8>re de Borodine'' and ''<U+00C0> la mani<U+00E8>re de Chabrier''.<ref name=ln9/> In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''.<ref>Canarina, p. 43</ref> Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music.<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 113</ref> Ravel predicted that the premiere of the ''Rite'' would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of ''Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande''.<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 157</ref>{{#tag:ref|The public premiere was the scene of a near-riot, with factions of the audience for and against the work, but the music rapidly entered the repertory in the theatre and the concert hall.<ref>Canarina, pp. 42 and 47</ref>|group= n}}

===War===
[[File:Maurice-Ravel-soldier-1916.jpg|thumb|alt=mmiddle aged man in French military uniform wrapped up in fur overcoat|upright|Ravel in army uniform in 1916]]
When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the [[French Air Force]]. He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint.<ref>Jank<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vitch, p. 179</ref> After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty.<ref name=o93>Orenstein (1995), p. 93</ref> Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: "at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing".<ref>''Quoted'' in Nichols (1987), p. 113</ref> Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment. At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health. His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following [[amoebic dysentery]] in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter.<ref>Larner, p. 158</ref>

During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Fran<U+00E7>aise was formed by Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music.<ref>Fulcher (2001), pp. 207<U+2013>208</ref> Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, "It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas."<ref>Orenstein (2003), p. 169</ref> The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts.<ref>Fulcher (2001), p. 208</ref>

Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a "horrible despair", compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war.<ref>Orenstein (2003), p. 180; and Nichols (2011), p. 187</ref> He composed few works in the war years. The [[Piano Trio (Ravel)|Piano Trio]] was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is ''Le tombeau de Couperin'', composed between 1914 and 1917. The suite celebrates the tradition of [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Couperin]], the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war.<ref>James, p. 81</ref>

===1920s===
After the war those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina. As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, "Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised";<ref name=z11>Zank, p. 11</ref> his output, never large, became smaller.<ref name=z11/> Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era.<ref name=o230/> Faur<U+00E9> wrote to him, "I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly. It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor."<ref name=o230>Orenstein (2003), pp. 230<U+2013>231</ref> Ravel was offered the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1920,{{#tag:ref|He never made clear his reason for refusing it. Several theories have been put forward. Rosenthal believed that it was because so many had died in a war in which Ravel had not actually fought.<ref name=f139>Fulcher (2005), p. 139</ref> Another suggestion is that Ravel felt betrayed because despite his wishes his ailing mother had been told that he had joined the army.<ref name=f139/> Edouard Ravel said that his brother refused the award because it had been announced without the recipient's prior acceptance.<ref name=f139/> Many biographers believe that Ravel's experience during the Prix de Rome scandal convinced him that state institutions were inimical to progressive artists.<ref>Kelly (2000), p. 9; Macdonald, p. 333; and Zank, p. 10</ref>|group= n}} and though he declined the decoration he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>s [[Les Six]] as an establishment figure.

===Last years===
At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos. He completed the [[Piano Concerto for the Left Hand (Ravel)|Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand]] first. It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist [[Paul Wittgenstein]], who had lost his right arm during the war. Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: "In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands."<ref>James, p. 126</ref> Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands.{{#tag:ref|It was a matter for affectionate debate among Ravel's friends and colleagues whether he was worse at conducting or playing.<ref>Nichols (1987), p. 92</ref>|group= n}} Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p 101</ref> In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year.<ref>Nichols and Mawer, p. 256</ref> The critic Henry Pruni<U+00E8>res wrote, "From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us."<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 104</ref>

The [[Piano Concerto (Ravel)|Piano Concerto in G major]] was completed a year later. After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting.<ref>Nichols and Mawer, p. 266</ref> Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting;<ref>Zank, p. 20</ref> they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas-Branco conducted.<ref>Orenstein (2003), pp. 535<U+2013>536</ref>

In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1988 the neurologist R A Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition.<ref name=h1586/> As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting [[aphasia]].<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 105</ref> Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, ''[[Don Quixote (1933 film)|Don Quixote]]'' (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and [[Jacques Ibert]] wrote most of the score.<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 330</ref> Ravel completed three songs for [[baritone]] and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as ''Don Quichotte <U+00E0> Dulcin<U+00E9>e''. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this.<ref name=h1586>Henson, p. 1586</ref> The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a [[tumour]], and have variously suggested [[frontotemporal dementia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]].<ref>Henson, pp. 1586<U+2013>1588</ref>{{#tag:ref|In 2008 ''The New York Times'' published an article suggesting that the early effects of frontotemporal dementia in 1928, and this might account for the repetitive nature of ''Bol<U+00E9>ro''.<ref>Blakeslee, Sandra.

Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.<ref name=h1586/>

In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find [[Ventricular system|ventricular]] dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.<ref>Henson, p. 1588</ref>

On 30 December 1937 Ravel was buried next to his parents in a granite tomb at the cemetery at [[Levallois-Perret]], a suburb of northwest Paris. Ravel was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony.<ref>[http://www.maurice-ravel.net/religion.htm "Ravel and religion"], Maurice Ravel, retrieved 11 March 2015</ref>

==Music==
{{see also|List of compositions by Maurice Ravel}}
Marcel Marnat's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned.<ref name=marnat>Marnat, pp. 721<U+2013>784</ref> Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries,{{#tag:ref|''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' credits Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns with 169 works, Faur<U+00E9> with 121 works and Debussy with 182.<ref>Nectoux Jean-Michel.

Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera, and song cycles. He wrote no symphonies or religious works.<ref name=marnat/>

Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]] to Faur<U+00E9> and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]].<ref>Orenstein (1991), pp. 64 (Satie), 123 (Mozart and Schubert), 124 (Chopin and Liszt), 136 (Russians), 155 (Debussy) and 218 (Couperin and Rameau)</ref> He considered himself in many ways a [[classicism|classicist]], often using traditional structures and forms, such as the [[ternary form|ternary]], to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 135</ref> The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.<ref>Nichols (2011), pp. 291, 314 and 319</ref>

Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is "an implied melodic outline in all vital music".<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 131</ref> His themes are frequently [[musical mode|modal]] instead of using the familiar major or minor scales.<ref>Jank<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vitch, pp. 106<U+2013>109</ref> As a result, there are few [[leading-tone|leading notes]] in his output.<ref>Taruskin, p. 112; and [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/16179 "Leading note"], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford University Press, retrieved 13 March 2015 {{subscription}}</ref> Chords of the [[extended chord|ninth and eleventh]] and unresolved [[appoggiatura]]s, such as those in the ''[[Valses nobles et sentimentales]]'', are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 132</ref>

Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the [[bolero]] and pavane, but also the [[minuet]], [[forlane]], [[rigaudon]], [[Waltz (music)|waltz]], [[czardas]], [[Habanera (music)|habanera]] and [[passacaglia]]. National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to [[Hebraic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Romani people|gypsy]] themes.<ref>Orenstein (1991), pp. 190 and 193</ref> He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired <U+2013> [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], Chabrier, Faur<U+00E9> and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 192</ref> Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that "true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion",<ref>Lanford, pp. 245<U+2013>246</ref> with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude.<ref>Lanford, pp. 248<U+2013>249.</ref>

===Operas===
Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others. The unrealised three were ''Olympia'', ''La cloche engloutie'' and ''Jeanne d'Arc''. ''Olympia'' was to be based on [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]]'s ''The Sandman''; he made sketches for it in 1898<U+2013>99, but did not progress far. ''La cloche engloutie'' after [[Gerhart Hauptmann|Hauptmann]]'s ''[[The Sunken Bell]]'' occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a ''"Symphonie horlog<U+00E8>re"'' which he incorporated into the opening of ''L'heure espagnole''.<ref>Zank, pp. 105 and 367</ref> The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil's 1925 novel about [[Joan of Arc]]. It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Op<U+00E9>ra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it.<ref>Nichols (1987), pp. 171<U+2013>172</ref>

[[File:L'heure-espagnole-1911.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=pencil sketches of characters in comic opera, head and shoulders only|Sketches of the cast for the 1911 premiere of ''L'heure espagnole'']]
Ravel's first completed opera was ''L'heure espagnole'' (premiered in 1911), described as a "com<U+00E9>die musicale".<ref name=grove-heure/> It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career. Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered "perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects".<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 129</ref> [[Edward Burlingame Hill]] found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, "giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action", and "commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage."<ref>Hill, p. 144</ref> Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity.<ref name=grove-heure>Nichols, Roger. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O002204 "Heure espagnole, L'"], ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 14 March 2015 {{subscription}}</ref> The critic David Murray writes that the score "glows with the famous Ravel ''tendresse''".<ref>Murray, p. 316</ref>

The second opera, also in one act, is ''L'enfant et les sortil<U+00E8>ges'' (1926), a "fantaisie lyrique" to a libretto by Colette. She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than ''L'heure espagnole'', and the jazz elements and [[bitonality]] of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds "profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work".<ref>Nichols, Roger. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O003509 "Enfant et les sortil<U+00E8>ges, L'"], ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 14 March 2015 {{subscription}}</ref> The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, "extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout".<ref>Murray, p. 317</ref>

Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones,<ref>White, p. 306</ref> Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad. For 2013<U+2013>15 [[Operabase]] records eight productions around the world of ''L'heure espagnole'' and twenty-four of ''L'enfant et les sortil<U+00E8>ges''.<ref>[http://operabase.com/oplist.cgi?id=none&lang=en&is=&by=Ravel&loc=&stype=abs&sd=2&sm=1&sy=2013&etype=abs&ed=&em=&ey= "Ravel"], Operabase, retrieved 17 March 2015</ref>

===Other vocal works===
A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal. His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome. His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as "a static, recitative-like vocal style", prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility.<ref name=grove/> By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in ''Histoires naturelles''. The same technique is highlighted in ''Trois po<U+00E8>mes de St<U+00E9>phane Mallarm<U+00E9>'' (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided. In the cycles ''Sh<U+00E9>h<U+00E9>razade'' and ''Chansons mad<U+00E9>casses'' Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.<ref name=grove/><ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 157</ref>

Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as ''Cinq m<U+00E9>lodies populaires grecques'', ''Deux m<U+00E9>lodies h<U+00E9>bra<U+00EF>ques'' and ''Chants populaires''.<ref>Jank<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vitch, pp. 29<U+2013>32</ref> Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, [[L<U+00E9>on-Paul Fargue]], [[Leconte de Lisle]] and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914<U+2013>15 he wrote his own texts.<ref> Jank<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vitch, p. 177</ref>

Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice,<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 280</ref> and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, ''Sh<U+00E9>h<U+00E9>razade'', to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 55</ref>

===Orchestral works===
During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous.<ref>Goddard, p. 291</ref> He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use.<ref>James, p. 21</ref> The critic [[Alexis Roland-Manuel]] wrote, "In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a ''pp'' [[tam-tam]] in the relationships of one orchestral group to another."<ref>''Quoted'' in Goddard, p. 292</ref>

[[File:Bakst Daphnis et Chlo<U+00EB> Set Act II 1912.jpg|thumb|alt=rustic-looking stage scenery depicting an ancient bower|left|Original setting for ''[[Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>]]'' by [[Leon Bakst]] (1912)]]
For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: ''Rapsodie espagnole'', ''La valse'' and the two concertos. All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in ''Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>'', or as a reworking of piano pieces, ''Alborada del gracioso'' and ''Une barque sur l'ocean'', (''Miroirs''), ''Valses nobles et sentimentales,'' '' Ma m<U+00E8>re l'Oye'', ''Tzigane'' (originally for violin and piano) and ''Le tombeau de Couperin.''<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 611<U+2013>612; and Goddard, p. 292</ref> In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms.<ref>Goddard, pp. 293<U+2013>294</ref> Occasionally, as in the ''Alborada del gracioso'', critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original.<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 611</ref>

In some of his scores from the 1920s, including ''Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>'', Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six or even eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility. His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points.<ref>Goddard, pp. 298<U+2013>301</ref> In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures. The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, alongside use of jazz-like themes.<ref>Orenstein (1991), pp. 204<U+2013>205</ref> The critics [[Edward Sackville-West]] and [[Desmond Shawe-Taylor (music critic)|Desmond Shawe-Taylor]] comment that in the slow movement, "one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented", the composer "can truly be said to join hands with Mozart".<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 610</ref> The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, ''Bol<U+00E9>ro'' (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating "a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm".<ref>Nichols (2011), p. 302</ref>

Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite ''Pictures at an Exhibition''. Orchestral versions of the last by [[Mikhail Tushmalov]], [[Henry Wood|Sir Henry Wood]] and [[Leo Funtek]] predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known.<ref>Oldani, Robert W.

===Piano music===
{{see also|List of solo piano compositions by Maurice Ravel}}
Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch "from the striking simplicity of ''Ma m<U+00E8>re l'Oye'' to the transcendental virtuosity of ''Gaspard de la nuit''."<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 193</ref> Ravel's earliest major work for piano, ''Jeux d'eau'' (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later.<ref>Orenstein (1981), p. 32; and Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 613</ref> When writing for solo piano Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity.<ref name=s613/> The authors of ''The Record Guide'' consider that works such as ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' and ''Miroirs'' have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration "in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself."<ref name=s613>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 613</ref>

Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges.<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 613<U+2013>614</ref>{{#tag:ref|in 2009 the pianist [[Steven Osborne (pianist)|Steven Osborne]] wrote of ''Gaspard'', "This bloody opening! I feel I've tried every possible fingering and nothing works.

But now I need a third hand for the melody."<ref>Osborne, Steven.

It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in ''Alborada del gracioso''{{space}}... and the two outer movements of ''Gaspard de la nuit''. Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale."<ref name=clark>Clark, Andrew.

Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; ''Menuet sur le nom de Haydn'' (1909), ''<U+00C0> la mani<U+00E8>re de Borodine'' (1912), ''<U+00C0> la mani<U+00E8>re de Chabrier'' (1913) and ''Le tombeau de Couperin'' all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner.<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 181</ref> Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: "Listen to ''Le tombeau de Couperin'' and the complete ballet music for ''Ma m<U+00E8>re L'Oye'' in the classic recordings conducted by [[Andr<U+00E9> Cluytens]], and the piano versions never sound quite the same again."<ref name=clark/>

===Chamber music===
Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works.<ref name=grove/> The earliest is the String Quartet (1902<U+2013>03), dedicated to Faur<U+00E9>, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier. Like the Debussy it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour.<ref>Griffiths, Paul. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40899 "String quartet"], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford University Press, retrieved 31 March 2015 {{subscription}}</ref> The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet, and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards. It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the ''Pavane pour une infante d<U+00E9>funte''.<ref>Anderson (1989), p. 4</ref> Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French army. It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, "blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own," in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson.<ref>Anderson (1994), p. 5</ref>

Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920<U+2013>22), the "Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Faur<U+00E9>" for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of ''Tzigane'' for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923<U+2013>27).<ref name=grove/> The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher,<ref>Phillips, p. 163</ref> and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist [[Jelly d'Ar<U+00E1>nyi]].<ref>Orenstein (1991), p. 88</ref> The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody.<ref name=o32>Orenstein (2003), p. 32</ref> His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work. Ravel said that the violin and piano are "essentially incompatible" instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility.<ref name=o32/> Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas "rather laboured and unsatisfactory",<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 612</ref> and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works.<ref>De Voto, p. 113</ref>

Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on [[piano roll]] between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by [[Robert Casadesus]], a better pianist.<ref name=o532>Orenstein (2003) pp. 532<U+2013>533</ref> Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc.<ref name=o532/> In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of ''Jeux d'eau'' played by [[Mark Hambourg]], and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the ''Pavane pour une infante d<U+00E9>funte'' and ''Ondine'', and movements from the String Quartet, ''Le tombeau de Couperin'' and ''Ma m<U+00E8>re l'Oye''.<ref name=charm>[http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/discography/search/disco_search.html "Ravel"], Discography search, AHRC Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, retrieved 15 March 2015</ref> Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public,{{#tag:ref|Other composers who made recordings of their music during the early years of the gramophone included [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and [[Richard Strauss]].<ref>Kennedy, Michael (ed). [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e4435 "Gramophone (Phonograph) Recordings"], The Oxford Dictionary of Music, Oxford University Press, retrieved 6 April 2015 {{subscription}}</ref>|group= n}} and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor.<ref>''The Gramophone'', Volume I, pp. 60, 183, 159 and 219; and Orenstein (2003), pp. 534<U+2013>535</ref> A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as "Conducted by the composer",<ref>[[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] advertisement,''The Gramophone'', Volume 10, p. xv</ref> although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton.<ref>Orenstein (2003), p. 536</ref> Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a ''Bol<U+00E9>ro'' in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist.<ref>Orenstein (2003), pp. 534<U+2013>537</ref>

==Honours and legacy==
Ravel declined not only the L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the [[Institut de France]].<ref>Nichols (2011), pp. 206<U+2013>207</ref> He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] in 1921,<ref>[http://royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/index.php/awards/honorary/honorary_members/members2 "Honorary Members since 1826"], Royal Philharmonic Society, retrieved 7 April 2015</ref> the Belgian [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Ordre de L<U+00E9>opold]] in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1928.<ref>Orenstein (1991), pp. 92 and 99</ref>

After Ravel's death his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it. {{as of|2015|alt=At 2015}} the maison-mus<U+00E9>e de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours.<ref>[http://www.ville-montfort-l-amaury.fr/La-maison-musee-de-Maurice-Ravel "Maison-mus<U+00E9>e de Maurice Ravel"], Montfort l<U+2019>Amaury, retrieved 31 March 2015</ref>

In his later years Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind.<ref name=henley/> After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine ''[[Le Point]]'' reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were.<ref>Inchausp<U+00E9>, Irene. (In French) [http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-economie/2007-01-16/a-qui-profite-le-bolero-de-ravel/916/0/3750 "A qui profite le ''Bol<U+00E9>ro'' de Ravel?"], ''Le Point'', 14 July 2000</ref> The British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair.<ref name=henley>Henley, Jon.
