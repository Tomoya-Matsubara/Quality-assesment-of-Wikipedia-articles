'''Scots''' refers to the [[Anglic languages|Anglic]] [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] spoken in parts of [[Scotland]]. In Scotland it is sometimes called ''Lowland Scots'' to distinguish it from [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] spoken by some in the [[Highlands and Islands area|Highlands and Islands]] (especially the [[Hebrides]]). Scots is also spoken in parts of [[Northern Ireland]] and border areas of the [[Republic of Ireland]], where it is known in official circles as ''[[Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots]]'' or ''Ullans''.

Since there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing [[language]]s from [[dialect]]s, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots. Although a number of paradigms do exist those often render sometimes contradictory results (See [[Dialect]]). Consequently Scots has, on one hand, traditionally been regarded as one of the ancient dialects of [[English language|English]] but also has its own ancient and distinct dialects.  Scots has often been treated as part of English as spoken in Scotland but differing significantly from the [[Scottish English|Standard Scottish English]] taught in schools. On the other hand, it has been regarded as a distinct [[Germanic language]] the way [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is distinct from [[Danish language|Danish]]. Its subordinance to Anglo-English has also been compared to that of [[Frisian Language|Frisian]] being subordinate [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the Netherlands. Thus ''Scots'' can be interpreted as a collective term for the dialects of English spoken or originating in Scotland, or it can be interpreted as the [[autochthonous language]] of Lowland Scotland. (See [[Scots language#Status|Status]] below)

[[Native speakers]] in Scotland and Ireland usually refer to their [[Idiom#Parlance|idiom]] as (braid) Scots (Eng: ''Broad Scots'') or use a dialect name such as ''the Doric'' or ''the Buchan Claik''. The old fashioned  ''[[Scotch]]'' occurs occasionally, especially in Ireland. Some literary forms are often referred to as [[Lallans]] (''Lowlands''). 

==History==
:''Main article: [[History of the Scots language]]''

The word Scot was borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] to refer to [[Scotland]] and dates from at least the first half of the 10th century.
Up to the [[15th century]] ''Scottis'' (modern form: ''Scots'') referred to [[Middle Irish|Gaelic]] (a [[Celtic language]] and tongue of the [[ancient Scots]], introduced from [[Ireland]] perhaps from the [[4th century]] onwards). Since the late 15th century <ref>[[A.J. Aitken]] in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992.</ref>, Anglic speakers in Scotland also started occassionally referring to their [[idiom]] as ''Scottis'' and increasingly called Gaelic ''Erse'' (from Erisch, or "Irish"), now often considered pejorative. 

[[Northumbrian (Anglo-Saxon)|Northumbrian]] [[Old English]] had been established in southeastern Scotland as far as the [[River Forth]] by the 7th century. It remained largely confined to this area until the 13th century, continuing in common use while Gaelic was the court language. English then spread further into Scotland via the [[burgh]]s, proto-urban institutions which were first established by King [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. The growth in prestige of English in the 14th century, and the complementary decline of French in Scotland, made English the [[Prestige dialect|prestige language]] of most of eastern Scotland.

Modern Scots thus grew out of the early northern form of [[Middle English]] spoken by the people of southeastern Scotland and northern England. Scots, or more accurately, [[Middle English]], made its first literary appearance in Scotland in the mid-14th century, when its form differed little from other northern Anglic dialects, and so Scots shared many Northumbrian borrowings from [[Old Norse]] and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] French. Later influences include [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Middle Saxon]] through trade with and immigration from the low countries, as well as [[Romance languages|Romance]] via ecclesiastical and legal [[Latin]] and French owing to the [[Auld Alliance]]. Scots has loan words resulting from contact with Gaelic. Early medieval legal documents show a language peppered with Gaelic legal and administrative loans. Today Gaelic loans are mainly for geographical and cultural features, such as ''ceilidh'', ''loch'' and ''clan''. Many Scots words have also [[List of English words of Scots origin|become part of English]]: ''flit'', 'to move home', ''greed'', ''eerie'', ''cuddle'', ''clan'', ''stob'', 'a post'.

Before the [[Treaty of Union 1707]], when Scotland and England joined to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], there is ample evidence that Scots was widely held to be a language other than English<ref>''NOSTRA VULGARI LINGUA:
SCOTS AS A EUROPEAN LANGUAGE 1500 - 1700'' [http://www.scots-online.org/airticles/eurlang.htm]</ref>. 
Today, in Scotland, most people's speech is somewhere on a continuum ranging from traditional broad Scots to [[Scottish English|Scottish Standard English]]. Many speakers are either [[Diglossia|diglossic]] and/or able to [[Code-switching|code-switch]] along the continuum depending on the situation in which they find themselves. Where on this continuum English-influenced Scots becomes Scots-influenced English is difficult to determine. (see [[Scots language#Language change|language change]] below). Consequently it is often disputed whether or not the varieties of Scots are dialects of Scottish English or constitute a separate language in their own right. 

The British government now accepts Scots as a [[regional language]] and has recognised it as such under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Evidence for its existence as a separate language lies in the extensive body of Scots literature, its independent <U+2014> if somewhat fluid <U+2014> [[Orthography|orthographic conventions]] and in its former use as the language of the original [[Parliament of Scotland]]. Since Scotland retained distinct political, legal and religious systems after the Union, many Scots terms passed into Scottish English. For instance, [[libel and slander]], separate in [[English law]], are bundled together as ''defamation'' in [[Scots law]].

After the Union and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself. Many leading Scots of the period, such as [[David Hume]], considered themselves Northern British rather than Scottish. They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed Union. Enthusiasm for this new Britishness waned over time, and the use of Scots as a [[literary language]] was revived by several prominent Scotsmen such as [[Robert Burns]]. There is no current institutionalised standard literary form. During the second half of the [[20th century]], enthusiasts developed regularised cross-dialect forms following historical orthographic conventions, but these have had a limited impact. In the [[written Scots language]], local loyalties often prevail, and the written form usually contains some Standard English adapted to represent the local pronunciation. However, many Scots words (which do not appear in Standard English) are still used in everyday speech.

No education takes place through the [[Medium of instruction|medium]] of Scots, though English lessons may cover it superficially, which usually entails reading some Scots literature and observing local dialect. Much of the material used is often Standard English disguised as Scots, which has upset both proponents of Standard English and proponents of Scots<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/archive.cfm?id=150582004 ''Exposed to ridicule'' Scotsman 7 Feb 2004]</ref> alike. One example of the educational establishment's approach to Scots is "''Write a poem in Scots. (It is important not to be worried about spelling in this <U+2013> write as you hear the sounds in your head.)''"<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/5to14/specialfocus/scots/ideas/index.asp ''Scots - Teaching approaches'' Learning and Teaching Scotland Online Service]</ref>, whereas guidelines for English require teaching pupils to be "''writing fluently and legibly with accurate spelling and punctuation.''" <ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/5to14/htmlunrevisedguidelines/Pages/englang/main/elng1003.htm ''National Guidelines 5-14: ENGLISH LANGUAGE'' Learning and Teaching Scotland Online Service]</ref>. On the one hand, this can be seen as revealing the institutionalised disregard for the idea of treating Scots as a language on a par with English. On the other hand, it can be seen as a teaching method to get around the fact that the pupils, the teachers, and the teachers' parents alike have been taught in school that Scots is 'bad spelling', and thus that pupils will self-censor any Scots that they do know. Scots can also be studied at university level.  The educational system often fails to further the objective to produce people able to read, write, and speak Scots as an autonomous alternative to English, thus contributing to its perceived status by non-Scots speakers as a series of local dialects of English. 

The use of Scots in the media is scant and is usually reserved for niches where local dialect is deemed acceptable, e.g. comedy, [[Burns Night]], or representations of traditions and times gone by. Serious use for news, encyclopaedias, documentaries, etc. rarely occurs in Scots, although the [[Scottish Parliament]] website offers some information on it.
Attitudes towards Scots in the media vary widely, as may be seen by contrasting this sober [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/culture/ulsterscots1.shtml official BBC Ulster article] with this satirical [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A139033 H2G2 entry].

It is often held that, had Scotland remained independent, Scots would have remained and been regarded as a separate language from English.  This has happened in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], where two independent countries developed [[Standard language|standardised languages]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] originating from a common Galician-Portuguese language, which itself originated from a common [[Iberian Romance language]] shared with Castilian [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. On the other hand a situation similar to that of  [[Swiss German]] and [[German language|standard German]] might have occurred. Equally, the present situation might have occurred, where the social elites and the upwardly mobile adopted [[Standard English]], causing institutional language shift. A model of [[language revival]] to which many enthusiasts aspire is that of the [[Catalan language]] in areas spanning parts of  Spain, France, Andorra and Italy, particularly as regards the situation of Catalan in [[Catalonia]].

==Language change==
After the Union of Scotland and England, the issue of language became topical, and foremost was the question of whether Scottish people should speak English or Scots. Gaelic was never considered an option; at the time, it was mostly relegated to the Highlands and Islands. Scots became considered to have a [[Substratum|substratal]] relationship to English, as opposed to an [[Adstratum|adstratal]] relationship.

On one hand, well-off Scots took to learning English through such activities as those of the Irishman [[Thomas Sheridan]] (father of [[Richard Sheridan]]), who in [[1761]] gave a series of lectures on English [[elocution]]. Charging a guinea at a time (about <U+00A3>65 in today's money), they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of [[Edinburgh]]. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the ''Society for the Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland''. This was not universally welcomed, as was illustrated by the summary by F. Pottle, [[James Boswell]]'s 20th century biographer, concerning James' view of his father [[Alexander Boswell (judge)|Alexander Boswell]]'s speech habits: ''He scorned modern literature, spoke broad Scots from the bench, and even in writing took no pains to avoid the Scotticisms which most of his colleagues were coming to regard as vulgar''.

On the other hand, the education system also became increasingly geared to teaching English, though this was initially impaired by the teachers' and students' lack of knowledge of English pronunciation through lack of contact with English speakers. Aspects of English [[grammar]] and [[lexis]] could be accessed through printed texts. By the [[1840s]] the Scottish Education Department's [[language policy]] was that Scots had no value ''"...it is not the language of 'educated' people anywhere, and could not be described as a suitable medium of education or culture"''. Students, of course, reverted to Scots outside the classroom, but the reversion was not complete. What occurred, and has been occurring ever since, is a process of [[language attrition]], whereby successive generations have adopted more and more features from English. This process has accelerated rapidly since wide-spread access to [[mass media]] in English, and increased population mobility, became available after the [[Second World War]]. It has recently taken on the nature of wholesale [[language shift]]. These processes are often erroneously referred to as language [[Language change|change]], [[Language convergence|convergence]] or [[Language merger|merger]].

A rather more positive take on this is that, rather than reject English culture, the Scots mastered and conquered it, becoming [[bilingual]] and writing some of the greatest works of the time, such as [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', in what was still a foreign language. However, most younger Scots today see a Scottish [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]], that is, Scottish English, as a sufficient marker of their Scottishness, and are generally not interested in retaining bilingualism in a language they consider old-fashioned, parochial, or simply ''uncool''. Residual features of Scots (often regarded as [[slang]]) in the speech of the young urban working class are often derogatorily referred to as ''[[Ned (Scottish)|Ned speak]]''.

==Literature==
:''Main article: [[Scottish literature]]''

Examples of the first English literature include [[the Lord's Prayer|Christ's Prayer]] in [[Northumbrian (Anglo-Saxon)|Northumbrian]] Anglo-Saxon from c. 650, which begins "Faeder ure, Thu the eart on heofonum,". Some Scottish and Norhumbrian folk still say "oor faither" and "thoo art". ''The Genesis Poem'' attributed to [[C<U+00E6>dmon]] of [[Whitby]] in [[Northumbria]] opens with the words "Us is riht mikel" which is translated as "We are mighty great", but in Scots could appear as "Us is richt muckle". The words were written around 675 by a monk trained by the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic church]] of [[Iona]] taking dictation from the illiterate herdsman Caedmon singing in Northumbrian Anglo-Saxon in a monastery then known by the Gaelic name of ''Streaneshalch''.<ref>[[Alasdair Gray|Gray, Alasdair]], ''[[The Book of Prefaces]]'', Bloomsbury Publishing, London 2000 (2002 edition) ISBN 0-7475-5912-0</ref> C<U+00E6>dmon's name is [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]], and some scholars think that he may have been bilingual. 
 
Among the earliest Scots literature is [[John Barbour]]'s ''Brus'' (fourteenth century), Whyntoun's ''Kronykil'' and [[Blind Harry]]'s ''Wallace'' (fifteenth century).  From the fifteenth century, much literature based around the Royal Court in Edinburgh and the [[University of St Andrews]] was produced by writers such as [[Robert Henryson]], [[William Dunbar]], Douglas and [[David Lyndsay]].  ''[[The Complaynt of Scotland]]'' was an early printed work in Scots.

After the seventeenth century, anglicisation increased, though Scots was still spoken by the vast majority of the population. At the time, many of the oral ballads from the [[Border ballads|borders]] and the North East were written down. Writers of the period were [[Robert Sempill]], [[Robert Sempill the younger]], [[Francis Sempill]], Lady Wardlaw and Lady [[Grizel Baillie]].

In the eighteenth century, writers such as Alan Ramsay, [[Robert Burns]], [[Robert Fergusson]] and [[Walter Scott]] continued to use Scots. Scott introduced vernacular dialogue to his novels. 

Following their example, such well-known authors as [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], William Alexander, [[George MacDonald]] and [[J. M. Barrie]] also wrote in Scots or used it in dialogue.

In the [[Victorian era]] popular Scottish newspapers regularly included articles and commentary in the vernacular, often of unprecedented proportions.<ref>William Donaldson, ''The Language of the People: Scots Prose from the Victorian Revival'', Aberdeen University Press 1989.</ref> 

In the early twentieth century, a [[Scottish Renaissance|renaissance]] in the use of Scots occurred, its most vocal figure being [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Other contemporaries were Douglas Young, Sidney Goodsir Smith, [[Robert Garioch]] and Robert McLellan. However, the revival was largely limited to verse and other literature.

In 1983 [[William Laughton Lorimer]]'s translation of the New Testament from the original Greek was published.

Highly anglicised Scots is often used in contemporary fiction, for example, the Edinburgh dialect of Scots in ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' by [[Irvine Welsh]] (later made into a motion picture of the same name, though with language allegedly anglicised even more to make it suitable for an international audience).

''But'n'Ben A-Go-Go'' by [[Matthew Fitt]] is a [[cyberpunk]] novel written entirely in what [http://www.scots-online.org/grammar Wir Ain Leid] (Our Own Language) calls "General Scots". Like all cyberpunk work, it contains imaginative [[neologism]]s.

==Dialects==
There are at least five Scots dialects: 
*[[Northern Scots]], spoken north of Dundee, often split into North Northern, Mid Northern&mdash;also known as North East Scots and referred to as "the [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]]"&mdash;and South Northern.
*[[Central Scots]], spoken from Fife and Perthshire to the Lothians and Wigtownshire, often split into North East and South East Central, West Central and South West Central Scots.
*[[South Scots]] or simply "Border Tongue" or "Borders' Dialect" spoken in the [[Scottish Borders|Border]] areas. 
*[[Insular Scots]], spoken in the [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]].
*[[Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots]], spoken by the descendants of Scottish settlers (and also many of Irish and English descent) in littoral [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]] in the Irish Republic, and sometimes described by the [[neologism]] "Ullans", a conflation of [[Ulster]] and [[Lallans]]. However, in a recent article, Caroline Macafee, editor of ''The Concise Ulster Dictionary'', stated that Ulster Scots was "clearly a dialect of Central Scots".

As well as the main dialects, [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]] and [[Glasgow]] (see [[Glasgow patter]]) have local variations on an anglicised form of Central Scots. In [[Aberdeen]], Mid Northern Scots is spoken.

==Pronunciation==
Many writers now strictly avoid apostrophes where they [[apologetic apostrophe|supposedly represent]] "missing" English letters. Such letters were never actually missing in Scots. For example, in the [[14th century]], [[Barbour]] spelt the Scots [[cognate]] of 'taken' as ''tane''. Since there has been no ''k'' in the word for over 700 years, representing its omission with an apostrophe seems pointless. The current spelling is usually ''taen''. The following is more a guide for readers. How the spellings are applied in practice is beyond the scope of such a short description. Phonetics are in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].

===Consonants===
Most consonants are usually pronounced much as in English but:
*'''c''': {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}, much as in English.
*'''ch''': {{IPA|/x/}}, also '''gh'''. Medial 'cht' may be {{IPA|/<U+00F0>/}} in Northern dialects. ''loch'' (Lake), ''nicht'' (night), ''dochter'' (daughter), ''dreich'' (dreary), etc.
*'''ch''': word initial or where it follows 'r' {{IPA|/t<U+0283>/}}. ''airch'' (arch), ''mairch'' (march), etc.
*'''gn''': {{IPA|/n/}}. In Northern dialects {{IPA|/gn/}} may occur.
*'''kn''': {{IPA|/n/}}. In Northern dialects {{IPA|/kn/}} or {{IPA|/tn/}} may occur. ''knap'' (talk), ''knee'', ''knowe'' (knoll), etc.
*'''ng''': is always {{IPA|/<U+014B>/}}.
*'''nch''': usually {{IPA|/n<U+0283>/}}. ''brainch'' (branch), ''dunch'' (push), etc.
*'''r''': {{IPA|/r/}} or {{IPA|/<U+0279>/}} is pronounced in all positions, i.e. [[rhotic]]ally.
*'''s''' or '''se''': {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}.
*'''t''': may be a glottal stop between vowels or word final. In Ulster dentalised pronunciations may also occur, also for 'd'.
*'''th''': {{IPA|/<U+00F0>/}} or {{IPA|/<U+03B8>/}} much as is English. Initial 'th' in ''thing'', ''think'' and ''thank'', etc. may be {{IPA|/h/}}.
*'''wh''': usually {{IPA|/<U+028D>/}}, older {{IPA|/x<U+028D>/}}. Northern dialects also have {{IPA|/f/}}.
*'''wr''': {{IPA|/wr/}} more often {{IPA|/r/}} but may be {{IPA|/vr/}} in Northern dialects. ''wrack'' (wreck), ''wrang'' (wrong), ''write'', ''wrocht'' (worked), etc.
*'''z''': {{IPA|/j<U+026A>/}} or {{IPA|/<U+014B>/}}, may occur in some words as a substitute for the older <{{latinx|<U+021D>}}> ([[yogh]]). For example: ''brulzie'' (broil), ''gaberlunzie'' (a beggar) and the names ''[[Menzies]]'', ''[[Finzean]]'', ''[[Culzean]]'', ''[[MacKenzie]]'' etc.  (As a result of the lack of education in Scots, ''MacKenzie'' is now generally pronounced with a /z/ following the perceived realisation of the written form, as more controversially is sometimes ''Menzies''.)

===Silent letters===
*The word final 'd' in '''nd''' and '''ld''': but often pronounced in derived forms. Sometimes simply 'n' and 'l' or 'n&#39;' and 'l&#39;'. ''auld'' (old), ''haund'' (hand), etc.
*'t' in medial '''cht''': ('ch' = {{IPA|/x/}}) and '''st''' and before final '''en'''. ''fochten'' (fought), ''thristle'' (thistle) also 't' in ''aften'' (often), etc.
*'t' in  word final '''ct''' and '''pt''' but  often pronounced in derived forms. ''respect'', ''accept'', etc.

===Vowels===
In Scots, [[vowel length]] is usually conditioned by the [[Scots vowel length rule]]. Words which differ only slightly in pronunciation from [[Scottish English]] are generally spelled as in English. Other words may be spelt the same but differ in pronunciation, for example: ''aunt'', ''swap'', ''want'' and ''wash'' with {{IPA|/a/}}, ''bull'', ''full'' v. and ''pull'' with {{IPA|/<U+028C>/}},  ''bind'', ''find'' and ''wind'' v., etc. with {{IPA|/<U+026A>/}}. 

*The unstressed vowel {{IPA|/<U+0259>/}} may be represented by any vowel letter. 
*'''a''': usually {{IPA|/a/}} but in south west and Ulster dialects often {{IPA|/<U+0251>/}}. Note final ''a'' in ''awa'' (away), ''twa'' (two) and ''wha'' (who) may also be {{IPA|/<U+0251>/}} or {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} depending on dialect.
*'''au''', '''aw''' and sometimes '''a''', '''a&#39;''' or '''aa''': {{IPA|/<U+0251><U+02D0>/}} or {{IPA|/<U+0254><U+02D0>/}} in Southern, Central and Ulster dialects but {{IPA|/a<U+02D0>/}} in Northern dialects. The cluster 'auld' may also be {{IPA|/<U+028C>ul/}} in Ulster. ''aw'' (all), ''cauld'' (cold), ''braw'' (handsome), ''faw'' (fall), ''snaw'' (snow), etc.
*'''ae''', '''ai''', '''a'''(consonant)'''e''': {{IPA|/e/}}. Often {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}} before {{IPA|/r/}}. In Northern dialects the vowel in the cluster -'ane' is often {{IPA|/i/}}. ''brae'' (slope), ''saip'' (soap), ''hale'' (whole), ''ane'' (one), ''ance'' (once), ''bane'' (bone), etc.
*'''ea''', '''ei''', '''ie''': {{IPA|/i<U+02D0>/}} or {{IPA|/e<U+02D0>/}} depending on dialect. {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}} may occur before {{IPA|/r/}}. Root final this may be {{IPA|/<U+0259>i/}} in Southern dialects. In the far north {{IPA|/<U+0259>i/}} may occur. ''deid'' (dead), ''heid'' (head), ''meat'' (food), ''clear'', ''speir'' (enquire), ''sea'', etc.
*'''ee''', '''e'''(Consonant)'''e''': {{IPA|/i<U+02D0>/}}. Root final this may be {{IPA|/<U+0259>i/}} in Southern dialects. ''ee'' (eye), ''een'' (eyes), ''steek'' (shut), ''here'', etc.
*'''e''': {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}}. ''bed'', ''het'' (heated), ''yett'' (gate), etc.
*'''eu''': {{IPA|/(j)u/}} or {{IPA|/(j)<U+028C>/}} depending on dialect. Sometimes erroneously 'oo', 'u(consonant)e', 'u' or 'ui'. ''beuk'' (book), ''ceuk'' (cook), ''eneuch'' (enough), ''leuk'' (look), ''teuk'' (took), etc.
*'''ew''': {{IPA|/ju/}}. In Northern dialects a root final 'ew' may be {{IPA|/j<U+028C>u/}}. ''few'', ''new'', etc.
*'''i''': {{IPA|/<U+026A>/}}, but often varies between {{IPA|/<U+026A>/}} and {{IPA|/<U+028C>/}} especially after 'w' and 'wh'. {{IPA|/<U+00E6>/}} also occurs in Ulster before voiceless consonants. ''big'', ''fit'' (foot), ''wid'' (wood), etc.
*'''i'''(consonant)'''e''',  '''y'''(consonant)'''e''', '''ey''': {{IPA|/<U+0259>i/}} or {{IPA|/a<U+026A>/}}. 'ay' is usually {{IPA|/e/}} but {{IPA|/<U+0259>i/}} in ''ay'' (yes) and ''aye'' (always). In Dundee it is noticeably {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}}.
*'''o''': {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}} but often {{IPA|/o/}}.
*'''oa''': {{IPA|/o/}}.
*'''ow''', '''owe''' (root final), seldom '''ou''': {{IPA|/<U+028C>u/}}. Before 'k' vocalisation to {{IPA|/o/}} may occur especially in western and Ulster dialects. ''bowk'' (retch), ''bowe'' (bow), ''howe'' (hollow), ''knowe'' (knoll), ''cowp'' (overturn), ''yowe'' (ewe), etc.
*'''ou''', '''oo''', '''u'''(consonant)'''e''': {{IPA|/u/}}. Root final {{IPA|/<U+028C>u/}} may occur in Southern dialects. ''cou'' (cow), ''broun'' (brown), ''hoose'' (house), ''moose'' (mouse) etc.
*'''u''': {{IPA|/<U+028C>/}}. ''but'', ''cut'', etc.
*'''ui''', also '''u'''(consonant)'''e''', '''oo''': {{IPA|/<U+00F8>/}} in conservative dialects. In parts of Fife, Dundee and north Antrim {{IPA|/e/}}. In Northern dialects usually {{IPA|/i/}} but {{IPA|/wi/}} after {{IPA|/g/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} and also {{IPA|/u/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} in some areas eg. ''fuird'' (ford). Mid Down and Donegal dialects have {{IPA|/i/}}. In central and north Down dialects {{IPA|/<U+026A>/}} when short and {{IPA|/e/}} when long. ''buird'' (board), ''buit'' (boot), ''cuit'' (ankle), ''fluir'' (floor), ''guid'' (good), ''schuil'' (school), etc. In central dialects ''uise'' v. and ''uiss'' n. (use) are {{IPA|[je<U+02D0>z]}} and {{IPA|[j<U+026A>s]}}.

===Suffixes===
*Negative '''na''': {{IPA|/<U+0251>/, /<U+026A>/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} depending on dialect. Also 'nae' or 'y' eg. ''canna'' (can't), ''dinna'' (don't) and ''maunna'' (mustn't).
*'''fu''' (ful): {{IPA|/u/, /<U+026A>/, /<U+0251>/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} depending on dialect. Also 'fu&#39;', 'fie', 'fy', 'fae' and 'fa'.
*The word ending '''ae''': {{IPA|/<U+0251>/, /<U+026A>/}} or {{IPA|/e/}} depending on dialect. Also 'a', 'ow' or 'y', for example: ''arrae'' (arrow), ''barrae'' (barrow) and ''windae'' (window), etc.

==Some grammar features==
Not all of the following features are exclusive to Scots and may also occur in other "[[Anglic languages|Anglic]] varieties".

===The definite article===
''The'' is used before the names of seasons, days of the week, many nouns, diseases, trades, occupations, sciences and academic subjects. It is also often used in place of the indefinite article and instead of a possessive pronoun: ''the hairst'' (autumn), ''the Wadensday'' (Wednesday), ''awa til the kirk'' (off to church),  ''the nou'' (at the moment), ''the day'' (today), ''the haingles'' (influenza), ''the Laitin'' (Latin), ''The deuk ett the bit breid'' (The duck ate a piece of bread), ''the wife'' (my wife) etc.

===Nouns===
Nouns usually form their plural in -(''e'')''s'' but some irregular plurals occur: ''ee''/''een'' (eye/eyes),  ''cauf''/''caur'' (calf/calves), ''horse''/''horse'' (horse/horses), ''cou''/''kye'' (cow/cows), ''shae''/''shuin'' (shoe/shoes).
Nouns of measure and quantity unchanged in the plural: ''fower fit''  (four feet), ''twa mile'' (two miles), ''five pund'' (five pounds), ''three hunderwecht''  (three hundredweight).
Regular plurals include ''laifs'' (loaves), ''leafs'' (leaves), ''shelfs'' (shelves) and ''wifes'' (wives), etc.

===Diminutives===
Diminutives in  -''ie'', ''burnie'' small ''burn'' (brook), ''feardie''/''feartie'' (frightened person, coward), ''gamie'' (gamekeeper), ''kiltie'' (kilted soldier), ''postie'' (postman), ''wifie'' (woman), ''rhodie'' (rhododendron), and also in  -''ock'', ''bittock'' (little bit), ''playock'' (toy, plaything), ''sourock'' (sorrel) and Northern <U+2013>''ag'', ''bairnag'' (little) ''bairn'' (child), ''Cheordag'' (Geordie),  -''ockie'', ''hooseockie'' (small house), ''wifeockie'' (little woman), both influenced by the Scottish Gaelic diminutive -''ag'' (-''<U+00F3>g'' in Irish Gaelic).

===Modal verbs===
The modal verbs ''mey'' (may), ''ocht tae'' (ought to), and ''sall'' ([[Shall and will|shall]]), are no longer used much in Scots but occurred historically and are still found in anglicised literary Scots. ''Can'', ''shoud'' (should), and ''will'' are the preferred Scots forms. 
Scots employs double modal constructions ''He'll no can come the day'' (He won't be able to come today), ''A micht coud come the morn'' (I may be able to come tomorrow), ''A uised tae coud dae it, but no nou'' (I could do it once, but not now).

===Present tense of verbs===
The present tense of verbs ends in -''s'' in all persons and numbers except when a single personal pronoun is next to the verb, ''Thay say he's ower wee'', ''Thaim that says he's ower wee'', ''Thir lassies says he's ower wee'' (They say he's too small), etc. ''Thay're comin an aw'' but ''Five o thaim's comin'', ''The lassies?   Thay've went'' but ''Ma brakes haes went''. ''Thaim that comes first is serred first'' (Those who come first are served first). ''The trees growes green in the simmer'' (The trees grow green in summer). 

''Wis'' 'was' may replace ''war'' 'were', but not conversely: ''You war''/''wis thare''.

===Past tense of verbs===
The regular past form of the verb is -(''i'')''t'' or -(''e'')''d'', according to the preceding consonant or vowel ''hurtit'', ''skelpit'' (smacked), ''Mendit'', ''kent''/''kenned'' (knew/known), ''cleant''/''cleaned'', ''scrieved'' (scribbled), ''telt''/''tauld'' (told), ''dee'd'' (died). Some verbs have distinctive forms: ''greet''/''grat''/''grutten'' (weep/wept),  ''fesh''/''fuish''/''fuishen'' (fetch/fetched), ''lauch''/''leuch''/''lauchen~leuchen'' (laugh/laughed), ''thrash''/''thruish''/''thrashen~thruishen'' (thresh/threshed), ''wash''/''wuish''/''washen~wuishen'' (wash/washed), ''gae''/''gaed''/''gane'' (go/went/gone), ''gie''/''gied''/''gien'' (give/gave/given), ''pit''/''pat''/''pitten'' (put/put/put/), ''git''/''gat''/''gotten'' (get/got/got(ten)), ''ride''/''rade''/''ridden'' (ride/rode/ridden), ''drive''/''drave''/''driven~dreen'' (drive/drove/driven), ''write''/''wrat(e)''/''written'' (write/wrote/written), ''bind''/''band''/''bund'' (bind/bound/bound), ''find''/''fand''/''fund'' (find/found/found), ''fecht''/''focht''/''fochten'' (fight/fought), ''bake''/''bakit~beuk''/''baken'' (bake/baked), ''tak(e)''/''teuk''/''taen'' (take/took/taken), ''chuse''/''chusit''/''chusit'' (choose/chose/chosen).

===Word order===
Scots prefers the word order ''He turnt oot the licht'' to 'He turned the light out' and ''Gie me it'' to 'Give it to me'.

Certain verbs are often used progressively ''He wis thinkin he wad tell her'', ''He wis wantin tae tell her''.

Verbs of motion may be dropped before an adverb or adverbial phrase of motion ''A'm awa tae ma bed'', ''That's me awa hame'', ''A'll intae the hoose an see him''.

===Ordinal numbers===
Ordinal numbers ending in -''t'' ''seicont'', ''fowert'', ''fift'', ''saxt''&mdash; (second, fourth, fifth, sixth) etc. ''first'', ''Thrid''/''third''&mdash; (first, third).

===Adverbs===
Adverbs are usually of the same form as the verb root or adjective especially after verbs. ''Haein a real guid day'' (Having a really good day). ''She's awfu fauchelt'' (She's awfully tired).

Adverbs are also formed with -''s'', -''lies'',  ''lins'', ''gate''(''s'')and ''wey''(''s'') -''wey'', ''whiles'' (at times), ''mebbes'' (perhaps), ''brawlies'' (splendidly), ''geylies'' (pretty well), ''aiblins'' (perhaps), ''airselins'' (backwards), ''hauflins'' (partly), ''hidlins'' (secretly), ''maistlins'' (almost), ''awgates'' (always, everywhere), ''ilkagate'' (everywhere), ''onygate'' (anyhow), ''ilkawey'' (everywhere), ''onywey''(''s'') (anyhow, anywhere), ''endweys'' (straight ahead), ''whit wey'' (how, why).

===Subordinate clauses===
Verbless subordinate clauses introduced by an and expressing surprise or indignation ''She haed tae walk the hale lenth o the road an her sieven month pregnant'', ''He telt me tae rin an me wi ma sair leg'' (and me with my sore leg).

===Negation===
Negation occurs by using the adverb ''no'',  in the North East ''nae'', as in ''A'm no comin'' (I'm not coming), or by using the suffix -''na'' (pronunciation depending on dialect), as in ''A dinna ken'' (I don't know), ''Thay canna come'' (They can't come), ''We coudna hae telt him'' (We couldn't have told him), and ''A hivna seen her'' (I haven't seen her). 
The usage with ''no'' is preferred to that with -''na'' with contractable auxiliary verbs like -''ll'' for ''will'', or in yes no questions with any auxiliary ''He'll no come'' and ''Did he no come?''

===Relative pronoun===
The relative pronoun is ''that'' (''&#39;at'' is an alternative form borrowed from Norse but can also be arrived at by contraction) for all persons and numbers, but may be left out ''Thare's no mony fowk'' (''that'') ''leeves in that glen'' (There aren't many people who live in that glen). The anglicised forms ''wha'', ''wham'', ''whase'' 'who, whom, whose', and the older ''whilk'' 'which' are literary affectations; ''whilk'' is only used after a statement ''He said he'd tint it, whilk wis no whit we wantit tae hear''. The  possessive is formed by adding '''s'' or by using an appropriate pronoun ''The wifie that's hoose gat burnt'', ''the wumman that her dochter gat mairit''; ''the men that thair boat wis tint''. 

A third adjective/adverb ''yon''/''yonder'', ''thon''/''thonder'' indicating something at some distance ''D'ye see yon''/''thon hoose ower yonder''/''thonder?'' Also ''thae'' (those) and ''thir'' (these), the plurals of ''this'' and ''that''.

In Northern Scots ''this'' and ''that'' are also used where "these" and "those" would be in Standard English.
