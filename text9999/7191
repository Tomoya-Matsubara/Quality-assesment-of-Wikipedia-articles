'''State Route 343''' (also known as '''NY 343''') is a state highway located entirely within central [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]]. It runs east<U+2013>west from the intersection of [[New York State Route 82|NY 82]] in the village of [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] to the [[Connecticut]] state line in the town of [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia]], where it continues eastward as '''Connecticut Route 343'''. Along the way, it has a 7.3-mile (11.7&nbsp;km) [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] from the hamlet of [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains]] to the hamlet of Amenia where NY&nbsp;22's concurrency changes to that of [[U.S. Route 44]].

Route 343 used the alignment of the Dover branch of the 19th-century [[Dutchess Turnpike]] for its entire length. The turnpike was a major transportation route at the time, connecting several local communities to [[Litchfield County, Connecticut]] and the city of [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]]. Modern Route 343 was first designated in 1930, connecting the hamlet of Amenia to the state line, but was relocated a few years later to run from the village of Milbrook to the hamlet of Dover Plains instead. The route was later extended to include its original alignment by 1947 using an overlap with NY&nbsp;22.

Several major landmarks along the way include the [[Wassaic State Multiple Use Area]] in the hamlet of Wassaic, Beekman County Park in the hamlet of Amenia, and the Troutbeck Conference Center in the hamlet of Leedsvile.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=z50|title=Amenia, New York quadrangle|publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2008-06-06|year=1989}}</ref> When Route 343 crosses the state line, becoming Connecticut Route 343, it becomes rural and residential, stretching for {{convert|1.50|mi|km}} into the town of [[Sharon, Connecticut]], where it terminates at [[Connecticut Route 4]] and [[Connecticut Route 41|41]].

== Route description ==
[[Image:NY 343 after terminus.jpg|right|thumb|NY 343 just after its concurrency with NY 22]]
Route 343 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 82|NY 82]] (cosigned as [[U.S. Route 44 (New York)|U.S. Route 44]] until 2008) in the hamlet of South Millbrook. The road heads eastward, intersecting an old routing of Route 82 and passing to the south of Millbrook Golf and Tennis Club. Route 343 continues past fields, residential homes, and farms. The highway passes south of Mill Brook, then enters the hamlet of Littlerest. Soon afterward, at the intersection with County Route 99, it turns to the southeast for a distance. At County Route 23, Route 343 again changes its direction, this time to the northeast. Before long, the highway crosses another stream named Stone Church Brook in the hamlet of [[Mutton Hollow, New York|Mutton Hollow]].<ref name="google"/> 

Route 343 then changes directions a third time, traveling to the southeast once again. In the hamlet of [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains]], Route 343 turns to the northeast and becomes concurrent  with northbound [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]]. The joined routes pass to the west of a series of moderately-sized mountains.<ref name="google">{{cite map|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=IBMA,IBMA:2006-25,IBMA:en&q=from:+US-44+%4041.775920,+-73.701850+to:+RT-343+%4041.762025,+-73.617251+to:RT-22/RT-343+%4041.816908,+-73.563029+to:RT-343+%4041.868133,+-73.501423&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl|title=Overview map of NY 343|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref> Routes 343 and 22 head north out of Dover Plains through regions of rural farms, fields and homes. The roads parallel the Tenmile River and soon intersects with County Route 81 (a former routing of NY&nbsp;22) south of the hamlet of Wassaic.  The roads parallel as they head north, coming through and leaving Wassaic, crossing the Wassaic Creek and entering a small valley. Routes 343 and 22 soon pass by the Wassaic Train Station and continue northward towards the hamlet of [[Amenia (CDP), New York|Amenia]].<ref name="google"/> 

[[Image:NY 343.jpg|left|thumb|NY 343 and straight arrow signs near Millbrook]]
County Route 81 merges as the main roads pass by [[Beekman Park (Amenia, New York)|Beekman Park]] and Silo Ridge Country Club in the hamlet of Amenia. The roads pass a pond and split at the intersection with [[U.S. Route 44]]. Routes 44 and 22 continue to the north, with Route 343 continuing eastward towards the state line. The road passes south of the Amenia Cemetery, changing directions several times. Route 343 then intersects with County Route 2 and turns to the northeast, passing over the Webatuck Creek. A few miles later, Route 343 crosses the state line and enters Connecticut.<ref name="google"/>

When Route 343 crosses the state line into the town of [[Sharon, Connecticut|Sharon]], it enters a moderately rural area where a large factory is located. Route 343, known as Amenia Road, heads northeast towards the town center, passing through patches of forests and intersecting with Sharon Valley Road, a connector to [[Connecticut Route 361]]. After passing north of Sharon Country Club, the highway turns east as it enters the town center, where various homes and businesses are located. Route 343 ends at an intersection with [[Route 4 (Connecticut)|Route 4]] and [[Route 41 (Connecticut)|Route 41]] south of the town green.<ref name="ct343">{{cite map|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from%3A%20Amenia%20Rd%2FCT-343%20%4041.868270%2C%20-73.501270%20to%3A%20Amenia%20Rd%2FCT-343%20%4041.876321%2C%20-73.477067&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl|title=Overview map of CT 343|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>

Route 343 is classified as a rural major [[collector road]] between Millbrook and Dover Plains and carries average annual daily traffic ([[AADT]]) of about 3,100 vehicles per day (as of 2006). The portion overlapped with Route 22 is a rural principal [[arterial road]] with average traffic of 5,600 per day. East of Route 22, Route 343 is a rural minor arterial road carrying about 4,100 vehicles per day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Traffic Data Viewer|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-06-24|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/divisions/engineering/applications/traffic-data-viewer}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Old roads ===
What is now Route 343 became a major transportation route that passed through the settlements of Wassaic and Amenia. The highway had helped [[General]] [[George Washington]]'s troops during the [[Revolutionary War]] and was also the main supply route to the hamlets of Payne's Corners (now Amenia), Washiac (now Wassaic) and Dover Plains. Stone statues that marked the way to different places including [[New York City]], [[Fishkill (village), New York|Fishkill]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] were put up along the road during the Revolution, helping suppliers of [[salt]] from Boston.<ref name="history1"/> This highway grew significantly over the years, with settlements growing along the highway during the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dutchess County Tourism Deparment|url=http://www.dutchesstourism.com/PDF/2005-Brochures/tour4.pdf|title=Dutchess County Tours|publisher=[[Dutchess County, New York]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> There were also a few factories along the route, including a [[Borden Food Corporation]] factory that produced [[condensed milk]] in the 1860s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mohawk.net/~dryolton/Amenia.html|title= Amenia, NY 12501|publisher=Mohawk.net|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> 

Route 343 from the NY&nbsp;22/US 44 intersection in Amenia to the [[Connecticut]] state line was part of the main line of the [[Dutchess Turnpike]], which ran from [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] to the state line at Amenia, mostly along modern US 44. Prior to the building of the turnpike, the section of Route 343 east of Amenia to the state line was a swamp and did not connect Amenia to the state line.<ref name="history1">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9QUCAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Early+history+of+Amenia&lr=&ei=pYdKSOCGKaPujAGZxdzmDQ#PPA103,M1|title=Early History of Amenia|author=Newton Reed|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> The turnpike corporation was established by law in April 1802 and had finished grading the highway in 1805.<ref name="1802 to 1805">{{cite book|author=Dutchess County Unit Federal Writers' Project|title=American Guide Series: Dutchess County|year=1937|publisher=William Penn Association of Philadelphia|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> In May 1803, the continuation of the Dutchess Turnpike into Connecticut, the [[Goshen and Sharon Turnpike]], was also chartered. When the road was completed a few years later, it established a continuous improved road between Poughkeepsie and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Frederic James Wood|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1pzNa0Ucb1UC|title=The Turnpikes of New England and Evolution of the Same Through England, Virginia, and Maryland|year=1919}}</ref> In 1806, a branch route, splitting off from the mainline at South Millbrook, was established to connect the hamlet of Dover Plains to Poughkeepsie. The southern branch used modern Route 343 from its western end at US 44 in South Millbrook to NY&nbsp;22 in Dover Plains.<ref name="turnpikes">[http://books.google.com/books?id=KJEDAAAAQAAJ The Revised Statutes of the State of New-York], Volume III, 1829, pp. 587<U+2013>624</ref><ref>Henry S. Tanner, 1823 and 1825 maps of New York, accessed via the [[David Rumsey Map Collection]]</ref> The state took over maintenance of the turnpikes at the beginning of the 20th century.

=== Designation ===
In 1924, the main line of the Dutchess Turnpike was designated as [[New York State Route 21 (1920s)|New York State Route 21]], connecting the city of [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] to the Connecticut state line as the original turnpike did. The road continued into Connecticut as [[New England Route 4]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[1924-12-21]]|page=XX9}}</ref> In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 state highway renumbering]], old Route 21 was broken up into several state routes. The portion between NY&nbsp;22 in the hamlet of [[Amenia (CDP), New York|Amenia]] and the Connecticut state line in the town of [[Sharon, Connecticut|Sharon]] was renumbered as NY&nbsp;343.<ref>{{cite news|author=Leon A.

[[Image:NY-200.svg|right|thumb|75px|NY 200 (1930&ndash;c.1947)]]
As part of the 1930 renumbering, the Dover branch of the Dutchess Turnpike between modern [[NY 82]] in the village of [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] and [[NY 22]] in the hamlet of [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains]] was designated as part of New York State Route 200, which began in the city of Poughkeepsie and went via Millbrook to Dover Plains. By 1935, however, New York swapped the designations of Routes 200 and 343. The former Route 343 between the hamlet of Amenia and the Connecticut state line was changed to Route 200, while part of former Route 200 between the village of Millbrook and the hamlet of Dover Plains became Route 343. The changes were made as a part of a reconfiguration of state routes in the area due to the designation of [[U.S. Route 44]] at the same time.<ref name=1935map>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide - New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> 

The Route 200 designation was removed from the Amenia<U+2013>Sharon road by 1947 and Route 343 was redesignated on it. The two segments of Route 343 were connected via an overlap with NY&nbsp;22, which remains to this day.<ref>{{cite map |title=Official Highway Map of New York State |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |edition=1947-48 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref>
