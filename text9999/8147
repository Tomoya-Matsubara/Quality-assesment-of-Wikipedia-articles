{{Politics of Rwanda}}

A '''presidential election''' was held in [[Rwanda]] on {{Nowrap|9 August}} 2010, the second since the [[Rwandan civil war]]. The incumbent President [[Paul Kagame]], of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], will stand for a second term.<ref>{{cite web|author=(AFP) &ndash; Sep 16, 2009 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jb00JkBmbiTPWnYVO2916k8cmm6Q |title=AFP: Rwandan presidential election set for August 2010 |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>

==Background==
A [[Constitution of Rwanda|new constitution]] was approved by referendum in Rwanda in 2003, and was followed shortly afterwards by the [[Rwandan presidential election, 2003|first presidential election]] in the country since the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide]].<ref>* Briggs, Philip and Booth, Janice (2006) ''Rwanda <U+2013> The Bradt Travel Guide''. pp 20<U+2013>21. 3rd ed. London: Bradt Travel Guides. ISBN 1841621803</ref> The constitution mandates seven-year presidential terms of office, leading to this election in 2010.<ref>[http://www.cjcr.gov.rw/eng/constitution_eng.doc Constitution of Rwanda] ''Legal and Constitutional Commission of Rwanda''. Retrieved 2008-10-20.</ref>

The incumbent is Paul Kagame, leader of the Rwandan Patriotic Front and a minority [[Tutsi]] who led his forces against the [[Hutu]]s after the civil war in 1994.<ref name="aljaz">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/20108714727701369.html |title=Rwanda presidential campaign ends <U+2013> Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref> In 2000 he became the [[President of Rwanda]]<ref>Briggs, Philip and Booth, Janice (2006) ''Rwanda <U+2013> The Bradt Travel Guide''. p18. 3rd ed.

During Kagame's tenure, Rwanda experienced high growth rates and a rise in infrastructure and international investment and tourism.<ref name="BBC" /> He has been criticised by some opposition figures and human rights groups for suppressing dissent in the period leading up to the election.<ref name="BBC" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/08/02/rwanda-attacks-freedom-expression-freedom-association-and-freedom-assembly-run-presi |title=Rwanda: Silencing Dissent Ahead of Elections |date=2010-08-02 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref>

==Candidates==
The election campaign began publicly in January 2010 when [[Victoire Ingabire]], a [[Hutu]] who had been living abroad for some years, returned to Rwanda and announced her candidacy for the presidency.<ref name="LasVegasSun">{{cite news |author=Straziuso, Jason |title=Rwandan opposition candidate denied run for office |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jul/02/rwandan-opposition-candidate-denied-run-for-office/ |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref> Ingabire caused some controversy in the country following her arrival, with comments relating to the genocide.<ref name="NewTimesIngabire">{{cite news |title=Ingabire Visits Genocide Convicts, Promises Help |newspaper=[[The New Times]] |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201001210115.html |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref> The government accused her of breaking the country's strict laws regarding [[Genocide denial]], and she was arrested in April 2010.<ref name="NewTimesIngabire" /> She was released on bail, but was prohibited from running in the election.<ref name="LasVegasSun" />

In May, President Kagame was officially endorsed as the RPF's candidate for the election, at the party's national congress.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New Times]] |author=Musoni, Edwin |title=Kagame Elected RPF Candidate |date=2010-05-16 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201005170194.html |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> Kagame then became the first candidate to be accepted when he presented his electoral papers in July.<ref name="LasVegasSun" /> The next candidate to register was Vice-President of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Rwanda|Chamber of Deputies]] and former Minister of Health [[Jean Damascene Ntawukuriryayo]], who won the nomination for the [[Social Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Social Democratic Party]] on {{Nowrap|22 May}}.<ref>{{cite news |work=Rwandinfo |title=Rwanda: Jean Damascene Ntawukuriryayo elected as presidential candidate by PSD congress |url=http://rwandinfo.com/eng/rwanda-jean-damascene-ntawukuriryayo-elected-as-presidential-candidate-by-psd-congress/ |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> In June, the [[Liberal Party (Rwanda)|Liberal Party]] named its candidate, with Vice-President of the [[Senate of Rwanda|Senate]] and former Minister of Commerce [[Prosper Higiro]] defeating [[Stephanie Mukantagara]] for the nomination, after the latter pulled out of the race at the last minute.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New Times]] |date=2010-06-07 |title=Higiro Elected Pl Presidential Candidate |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201006070003.html |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> The final candidate to successfully register was Senator [[Alvera Mukabaramba]] of the [[Party for Progress and Concord]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New Times]] |author=Kanyesigye, Frank |title=Mukabaramba campaigns in Kimisagara |url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14344&article=32260 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref>

Two of three other contenders failed to get official documents through and this did not get accepted into the race; while the other party was said to have effectively disintegrated, leaving no real opposition to Kagame. The three candidates running against Kagame supported him in the [[Rwandan presidential election, 2003]] and are described by other parties as the RPF's "political satellites" <U+2013> token opposition used to maintain a facade of pluralism.<ref name="aljaz">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/20108714727701369.html |title=Rwanda presidential campaign ends <U+2013> Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>

==Controversy==   
The runup to the election was plagued with the "killings of opposition figures," including the unsolved beheading of the vice-president of the [[Democratic Green Party of Rwanda|Democratic Green Party]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Kagwa Rwisereka]], and the murdering of journalist [[Jean-L<U+00E9>onard Rugambage]], sparked concern, and prompted the [[United Nations]] to demand an investigation.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/18/attacks-rwandan-opposition-un-warning "Deadly attacks on Rwandan opposition spark warning by UN"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 18, 2010</ref> The ''BBC'' described the electoral campaign as "marred by violence and intimidation against opposition politicians."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10694722 "Rwandan presidential campaign begins ahead of polls"], BBC, July 20, 2010</ref> [[Burkina Faso|Burkinab<U+00E9>]] newspaper ''Le Pays'' <U+2013> in an article relayed by the ''[[Courrier International]]'' <U+2013> condemned the killing of "those who might disturb Paul Kagame's reelection," and called on the international community to take a hard stance against the Kagame government.<ref>[http://www.lepays.bf/spip.php?article2074 "Kagame en Espagne"], ''Le Pays'', July 18, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.courrierinternational.com/article/2010/07/19/paul-kagame-un-dictateur-en-voie-de-reelection "Paul Kagam<U+00E9>, un dictateur en voie de r<U+00E9><U+00E9>lection"], ''Courrier International'', July 19, 2010</ref> [[Amnesty International]] also condemned the attacks and called on the government to ensure an atmosphere for Rwandans to "freely express their views," where the killing had created a climate of repression to inhibit freedom of expression. "In recent months, killings, arrests and the closure of newspapers and broadcasters has reinforced a climate of fear. The Rwandan government must ensure that investigations into the killings are thorough and reinstate closed media outlets."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/466/50840.html |title=AI condemns Rwanda pre-election attacks |publisher=Bizcommunity.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>

In June, Rwanda was also embroiled in controversy after freeing an American lawyer, who worked with the Tanzania-based [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], and was arrested and charged with "genocide denial and threatening state security."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/06/201061817820874539.html |title=Rwanda frees US lawyer <U+2013> Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>    
   
[[Rwandan - South African relations|South Africa]] also recalled its ambassador to Rwanda to discuss the situation in the country the week before the elections. The came about two months after a dissident Rwandan general survived an assassination attempt in [[Johannesburg]]. General [[Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa]], who was a critic of Kagame, alleged the it was an assassination attempt; a charge Rwanda denied. Days later, a journalist who claimed to have uncovered the regime's responsibility in the attempted murder, was shot dead.<ref name="aljaz"/> 

After South Africa arrested five men over the shooting and revealed their nationalities, Rwanda summoned the South African ambassador to express concern about the investigation. However, South Africa denied the recall was in "making any connections between the government of Rwanda and the shooting of the general." 

Opposition parties also said more than 30 newspapers had been banned. Amnesty International also said opposition party figures had been intimidated, journalists had been targeted and killed, and several senior officers critical of the ruling party attacked and arrested. Foreign Minister, [[Louise Mushikiwabo]], refuted the claims saying "The international media and human rights groups are misrepresenting what is happening in the country. My government does not stand to gain from any actions of insecurity. Paul Kagame happens to be a very popular candidate. I think to point a finger at this government is wrong. Anyone who is reading the situation from Rwanda would know that there is an atmosphere of excitement among the public."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/201086123114774190.html |title=S Africa recalls Rwanda diplomat <U+2013> Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>

Anil K Gayan, a former foreign minister of Mauritius and the head of the AU monitoring delegation, said "We have not received any evidence of intimidation." He also talked about the turnout for the elections saying that though political rallies may have been well attended "Crowds do not necessarily translate into votes." Kagame also refuted opposition claims and said the vote was "very democratic. The people of Rwanda were free to stand for election, those who wanted to, and to qualify, so I see no problem. Some sections of the media seem to be reading from a different page."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/20108943239684905.html |title=Voting ends in Rwandan election <U+2013> Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>

=== Violence ===
Although the election campaign was mostly conducted peacefully,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New Times]] |author=Munyaneza, James |title=A race to remember  |url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14340&article=32028 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref> there have been a number of incidents which attracted international attention. In February and March 2010 there were a series of attacks in [[Kigali]], killing one person and injuring several, which were linked to the upcoming election. This and other bombings in the country were attributed to the Hutu-dominated [[Interhamwe]] and the exiled former Rwandan ambassador to India, [[Kayumba Nyamwasa|General  Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa]].<ref name="BBCGrenade">{{cite news |work=BBC News |title=Rwanda <U+2013> Kigali hit by twin grenade attacks |date=2010-03-05 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8551516.stm |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref>

A [[grenade]] attack occurred in Kigali hours after the election commission announced Kagame's victory, injuring about 20 people. Media reports indicated the attack may have been connected to earlier attacks in the same area.<ref name="aljaz2">http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/201081118659123980.html</ref>

==Results==
Kagame was declared the winner of the election, according to results released by the National Electoral Commission on {{Nowrap|11 August}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rwanda President Kagame wins election with 93% of vote|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10935892|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate={{Nowrap|11 August}} 2010|date={{Nowrap|11 August}} 2010}}</ref>

However, opposition and human rights groups said the election were tainted by repression, murder and lack of credible competition. Kagame  responded saying "I see no problems, but there are some people who choose to see problems where there are not."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/201081055824857943.html |title=Rwanda's Kagame set for big win <U+2013> Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref> Observers also criticised the poll because the campaign was devoid of "critical opposition voices" with the three other candidates standing in the poll linked to Kagame's party.<ref name="aljaz2"/>
