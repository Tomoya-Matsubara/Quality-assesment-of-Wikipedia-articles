He was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] 24th overall in the [[1996 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Mississippi State Bulldogs|Mississippi State]].

==College career==
At [[Mississippi State University]], Moulds caught 117 passes for 2,022 yards (averaging 17.1 per catch). Moulds was the 1994 [[NCAA]] [[Division I-A]] [[kickoff returner|kickoff return]] champion with a 32.8 yrds/return average.<ref name=NCAA>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|title=Official 2007 NCAA Division I Football Record Book|publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association|accessdate=2008-01-03|year=2007|month=August}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===Buffalo Bills===
In 1998, Moulds led all [[American Football Conference|AFC]] receivers with 1,368 receiving yards.  

In the [[NFL playoffs, 1998-99|playoffs]] Moulds had a record breaking 240 yard performance against the [[Miami Dolphins]], though he lost a fumble on the Bills' first play, a 65-yard pass from Flutie.  Buffalo lost 24-17.

Since then, Moulds established himself as one of the premier receivers in football, amassing 675 career receptions (as of the end of 2005) and has been selected to three [[Pro Bowl]]s.

Making this the Bills number one wide receiver for a number of years, and also taught the fast young talent [[Lee Evans]] when he first came into the NFL.

===Houston Texans===
On [[April 4]], [[2006]], Moulds was traded to the [[Houston Texans]], in exchange for their fifth round draft pick in the [[2006 NFL Draft]].

On February 28, 2007, Moulds was released from the Texans after a disappointing [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]]. After his release, Moulds criticized then-Texans QB [[David Carr]] by saying "The quarterback has to show that he can carry (the team)."

===Tennessee Titans===
The [[Tennessee Titans]] signed Moulds on July 25, 2007 <ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-07-25-3196047994_x.htm Titans agree to terms with Eric Moulds - USATODAY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and at the beginning of the season he had earned a starting position.  That season, he played in all 16 games, having the 4th most receptions on his team, 2nd most by wide receivers, with 32 catches for 342 yards.

Moulds was released after the 2007 - 2008 season.
He had a workout with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in May 2008 without being picked up by them. 
It would appear his NFL career has come to an end after 12 years.
