Written by series creator [[Josh Schwartz]] and directed by executive producer [[Doug Liman]], the episode depicts the introduction of troubled teenager [[Ryan Atwood]] ([[Benjamin McKenzie]]) into the wealthy lifestyle of the Cohen family in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[California]].

The casting directors, Patrick J. Rush and Alyson Silverberg, began selecting the principal cast eight to ten weeks before filming started. The role of Ryan was particularly hard to cast. [[Seth Cohen]] ([[Adam Brody]]) was based on Schwartz's experiences at the [[University of Southern California]] as a "neurotic Jewish kid from the East Coast in a land of water polo players".<ref name="Seth quote"/> Other central characters in the episode are Seth's parents<U+2014>[[Sandy Cohen|Sandy]] ([[Peter Gallagher]]) and [[Kirsten Cohen|Kirsten]] ([[Kelly Rowan]])<U+2014>and teenage next-door neighbor [[Marissa Cooper]] ([[Mischa Barton]]).

The series premiere led the first half-hour of its time slot in [[audience measurement|viewership]]. It was generally well received by critics, and earned Schwartz a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nomination for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay - Episodic Drama|Best Screenplay in an Episodic Drama]]. Rush and Silverberg received an [[Artios Award]] nomination for excellence of casting in the Dramatic Pilot category. Originally broadcast and released in a [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|1.33:1 aspect ratio]], it was remastered in a [[Aspect ratio (image)#16:9 standard|widescreen]] ratio for the series DVD, released in November 2007. The episode was released on [[MiniDVD]] on April 26, 2005, and is available to purchase from [[video on demand]] services.

== Plot ==
A [[cold open]] shows [[Trey Atwood]] ([[Bradley Stryker]]) and his brother Ryan stealing a car. The police chase and arrest the boys, resulting in a prison term for Trey and a short stay in [[juvenile hall]] for the underage Ryan. A conversation between Ryan and his [[public defender]], Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), establishes Ryan as a smart boy with a rough upbringing; he has three truancies and two suspensions, but his [[SAT I]] scores are in the ninety-eighth percentile. When Ryan's mother, [[Dawn Atwood|Dawn]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]), collects Ryan, Sandy gives his business card to the boy. At home in [[Chino, California|Chino]], Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J. (Ron Del Barrio), expels him from the house. Standing at a payphone with nowhere to go, Ryan calls Sandy for help. As Sandy drives Ryan to his house in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], the [[opening credits]] and the [[California (Phantom Planet song)|theme tune]] play<U+2014>unlike the other episodes, there is no [[title sequence]].<ref name="Here">{{cite episode|title=Premiere|series=''The O.C.''|serieslink=The O.C.|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|airdate=August 5, 2003|season=[[The O.C. (season 1)|1]]|number=[[List of The O.C. episodes#ep1|1]]}}</ref>

While Sandy tries to convince his wife, Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) to allow Ryan to stay in the pool house for a night, Ryan meets the girl next door, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton). When her boyfriend [[Luke Ward|Luke]] ([[Chris Carmack]]) picks her up, Marissa invites Ryan to attend a fashion show fundraiser the following night. On a sailing trip the next day, the Cohens' son, Seth (Adam Brody) reveals to Ryan that he has a crush on [[Summer Roberts|Summer]] ([[Rachel Bilson]]) and would like to sail to [[Tahiti]] with her, but that she never pays him any attention. Later, Marissa leaves for the fashion show with her mother [[Julie Cooper|Julie]] ([[Melinda Clarke]]), her father [[Jimmy Cooper (The O.C.)|Jimmy]] ([[Tate Donovan]]), and her younger sister [[Kaitlin Cooper|Kaitlin]] ([[Shailene Woodley]]). The Cohens and Ryan also attend the show.

Summer invites Ryan to a party after the show, and Ryan convinces Seth to join him. For the first time, Seth is introduced to the sex-, drug-, and alcohol-fueled side of Newport. He experiences the wildness of a party for the first time, while Ryan flirts with Marissa. Luke takes a girl to the beach. Later at the party, Ryan rebuffs an intoxicated Summer, but Seth misinterprets the encounter and reveals Ryan's real background. Seth walks down the beach, and is bullied by a group of water polo players that includes Luke. Ryan defends Seth by punching Luke, but Luke's friends intervene and beat up Ryan and Seth. After returning to the Cohens, Ryan sees that Marissa's friends left her passed out on her drive; he carries her to the Cohens' pool house to sleep. When Kirsten finds Seth and Ryan asleep in the pool house the next morning, she is unhappy with Ryan's new influence and insists to Sandy that Ryan leaves. Sandy drives Ryan back to Chino, but when they find his home empty, they return to Newport.
