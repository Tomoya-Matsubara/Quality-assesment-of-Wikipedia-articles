'''Max Pacioretty''' (born November 20, 1988) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[ice hockey]] player currently playing for the [[Montreal Canadiens]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). He was called up from the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) for the second time on December 12, 2010.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://montreal.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101212/mtl_habshub_habit_101212/20101212/?hub=MontrealSports | title = Daily Hab-it: Pacioretty gets his wish | publisher = ''[[CTV Montreal]]'' | date = 2010-12-12 | accessdate = 2010-12-15}}</ref> He was drafted 22nd overall in the [[2007 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Montreal Canadiens]].

== Playing career ==
Pacioretty played high school hockey at [[New Canaan High School]] during his freshman year, and then moved on to [[The Taft School]] in Watertown, Connecticut. He signed a three-year contract with the Canadiens on July 17, 2008, thus forgoing his remaining eligibility at the [[University of Michigan]].

Pacioretty made his NHL debut with the Montreal Canadiens on January 2, 2009, scoring his first NHL goal on his first NHL shot in a 4-1 loss against the [[New Jersey Devils]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/gamecenter/recap/NHL_20090102_MON@NJ | title = Devils whip Canadiens behind sharp play from Clemmensen | publisher = ''[[CBS Sports]]'' | date = 2010-12-12 | accessdate = 2010-12-15}}</ref> He is the first player in franchise history to wear the jersey #67.

===Chara incident===
On March 8, 2011, Pacioretty suffered an injury following a hit by [[Boston Bruins]] defenseman [[Zdeno Chara]]. The force and location of the hit resulted in Pacioretty colliding with the [[stanchion]] at the end of the bench. He was taken off the ice on a stretcher after laying motionless on the ice for several minutes.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=555430 | title = Max Pacioretty taken off ice on stretcher / Video | publisher =''[[National Hockey League]]'' | date = 2011-03-08}}</ref> The extent of the injury was revealed the next day to be a fracture to the [[Cervical vertebra 4|4th cervical vertebra (C4)]] and a severe [[concussion]].  One Bruin, Mark Recchi, questioned the severity of the concussion during an interview stating that Pacioretty was at a movie theater four days after the incident.<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://habsinsideout.com/main/46877 | title = Fractured Vertebra for Pacioretty | publisher = ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' | date = 2011-03-09 | accessdate = 2011-03-09}}</ref> For delivering the hit Chara received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct, and after reviewing videotape of the play the NHL decided no further punishment was warranted.<ref>{{citeweb| url = http://www.nesn.com/2011/03/zdeno-chara-wont-be-suspended-or-fined-by-nhl-for-hit-on-max-pacioretty.html | title = Zdeno Chara won't be suspended or fined by NHL for hit on Pacioretty | publisher = ''[[NESN]]'' | date = 2011-03-09 | accessdate = 2011-03-09}}</ref> However, a criminal investigation was announced by the Montreal police. Additionally, [[Air Canada]] threatened to remove its sponsorship if the league does not take any action to prevent further violence on ice.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Pacioretty on-ice hit to be investigated by police | publisher = ''[[CBC News]]'' | date = 10 Mar. 2011 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2011/03/10/pacioretty-hit-police-investigation.html | accessdate = 10 Mar. 2011}}</ref>
