'''Stephen Gary "Woz" Wozniak''' (born [[August 11]] [[1950]] in [[San Jose, California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer engineer]] turned [[philanthropist]]. His inventions and machines are credited with contributing greatly to the [[personal computer]] revolution of the 1970s. Wozniak co-founded [[Apple Computer]] with [[Steve Jobs]] in 1976 and created the [[Apple I]] and [[Apple II family|Apple II]] computers in the mid-1970s. The Apple II became one of the best selling computers of the [[1970s]] and early [[1980s]], and became a very popular personal computer. 

Wozniak has several [[nickname]]s, including "The Woz" and "Wizard of Woz." "WoZ" (short for "Wheels of Zeus") is also the name of a company Wozniak founded. Woz also developed the initial prototype of the classic [[Atari]] game ''[[Breakout]]'' in four days.<ref name="iwoz">Wozniak, S. G. (2006), ''iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It''. [[W. W. Norton & Company]]. ISBN 0-393-06143-4.</ref> He is known for his introverted character, and he finds his level of celebrity somewhat annoying. He is also known as the "Other Steve" of Apple Computer, the more prominent Steve being co-founder and current CEO [[Steve Jobs]].

==The dawn of Apple==
By 1975, Woz dropped out of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (he would later return to finish his BS degree in [[EECS]], which he received in 1986) and came up with the computer that eventually made him famous. However, he was largely working to impress other members of the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]-based [[Homebrew Computer Club]], a local group of electronics hobbyists. His project had no wider ambition.<ref name="iwoz" />

Steve Jobs, a high school friend, had the idea to sell the computer as a fully assembled PC board. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not a success they could at least say to their grandkids they had their own company. Together they sold some of their prized possessions (e.g. Woz's HP scientific calculator and Jobs' Volkswagen van), raised [[United States dollar|USD$]]1,300, and assembled the first prototypes in Jobs' bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in Jobs' garage. Their first computer was quite an engineering marvel within the context of 1975 computing. In simplicity of use it was years ahead of the [[Altair 8800]], which was introduced earlier in 1975. The Altair had no display and no true storage. It received commands via a series of switches (a single program would require thousands of toggles without an error), and its output was presented in the form of flashing lights. The Altair was great for hobbyists, for whom its assembly-required nature was actually a feature, but it was not suitable for the wider public. Woz's computer, on the other hand, which he named [[Apple I]], was a fully assembled and functional unit that contained a $20 [[microprocessor]] ([[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]]) on a single-circuit board with [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. All that was needed was some RAM, a keyboard, and a monitor to make a fully functional microcomputer. 

On [[April 1]], [[1976]], Jobs and Wozniak formed Apple Computer. Wozniak quit his job at [[Hewlett-Packard]] and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple. The Apple I was priced at $666.66. Jobs and Wozniak sold their first 100 computers to a local dealer.<ref name="iwoz" />

Wozniak could now focus full-time on fixing the shortcomings of the Apple I and adding new functionality. His new design was to retain the most important characteristics: simplicity and usability. Woz introduced high-resolution graphics in the [[Apple II family|Apple II]].<ref name="iwoz" /> His computer could now display pictures instead of just letters: "I threw in high-res. It was only two chips. I didn't know if people would use it." By 1978, he also designed an inexpensive [[floppy drive|floppy-disk drive]] controller. He and [[Randy Wigginton]] wrote a simple disk operating system, adapting a file system and simple command line interface licensed from [[Shepardson Microsystems]] [http://www.laughton.com/Apple/Apple.html] to his disk interface.<!-- No trace of this in "iWoz" -->

In addition to designing the hardware, Wozniak wrote most of the software that ran on the Apple. He wrote an advanced programming language interpreter named [[Calvin (programming language)|Calvin]], a set of virtual [[16-bit]] processor instructions known as [[SWEET16]], a ''[[Breakout]]'' game (which was also a reason to add sound to the computer), the code needed to control the disk drive, and more. 

In 1980, Apple went public and made Jobs and Wozniak millionaires.

==Beyond the Apple II==
For years the Apple II was the main source of profit at Apple, and it assured the company's survival when its management undertook much less profitable ventures like the ill-fated [[Apple III]] and the short-lived [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]. It was because of the reliable profits from the Apple II that Apple was able to develop the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], bring it to market, and evolve it into Apple's primary technology, eventually replacing the machine that paid for it. In this sense, Wozniak can be considered the financial godfather of the Mac.

In February 1981, Steve Wozniak crashed his [[Beech Bonanza]] taking off from [[Santa Cruz Sky Park]]. As a result, he had temporary short-term memory loss. He had no recollection of the accident and, for a while, did not even know he had been involved in a crash. He began to piece together clues from things people said to him. He asked his girlfriend, Candy Clark (an early Apple employee who worked in the accounting department) whether he had been involved in an accident of some kind. When she told him of the event, his short-term memory was restored.<ref name="iwoz" /> Wozniak also credits Apple II [[computer game]]s for aiding him in restoring those "lost" memories.

Woz did not return to Apple after recovering from the plane crash. Instead, he married Clark (he called her "[[Superwoman]]", possibly because of her accomplishments as an Olympic kayaker in 1976<ref>[http://www.macobserver.com/columns/thisweek/2004/20040613.shtml "This Week in Apple History"] from ''The Mac Observer''</ref>) and returned to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under the name "Rocky (Raccoon) Clark" (Rocky was his dog's name and Clark his wife's maiden name), finally earning his undergraduate degree in 1986. In 1983 he decided to return to Apple product development, but he wanted no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.<ref name="iwoz" />

Woz and Clark divorced in 1987. At his high school reunion, he reconnected with Suzanne Mulkern, former head cheerleader and homecoming queen, and the two were married in 1990.

In 1982 and 1983, Wozniak also sponsored the two [[US Festival]]s, which were a celebration of evolving technologies and a marriage of music, computers, television and people.

==Post-Apple career==
Woz ended his full time employment with Apple for good on [[February 6]], [[1985]], nine years after setting up the company.  However he still remains an employee (including receiving a paycheck)<ref name="wozemployee">http://www.woz.org/letters/general/53.html</ref><ref name="iwoz" />, a stockholder <ref name="wozstock">http://www.fool.com/research/2000/features000302.htm</ref>, and a friend to Steve Jobs. Wozniak then founded a new venture called [[CL 9]], which developed home [[remote control]] switches, bringing the first universal remote control to market in [[1987]].<ref name="iwoz" />

About this time, Wozniak became a non-religious member of [[Freemasonry|the Freemasons]] in order to spend more time with his second wife, Candi, who was a member of the equivalent women's group, the [[Order of the Eastern Star]].<ref name="iwoz" />

Woz went into teaching (he taught fifth grade students) and charitable activities in the field of education. Since leaving Apple Computer, Woz has provided all the money, as well as a good amount of on-site technical support, for the technology program for the [[Los Gatos]] School district (the district in which he lives and where his children attend school). [[Unuson]] (Unite Us In Song), an organization Woz formed to organize the two [[US Festival]]s, is now primarily tasked with supporting his educational and philanthropic projects.

Wozniak received the [[National Medal of Technology]] in 1985 from [[Ronald Reagan]], then [[President of the United States]].<ref name="iwoz" />

In 1997 he was named a Fellow of the [[Computer History Museum]]. Wozniak was a key contributor and benefactor to San Jose's [[Children's Discovery Museum]] (the street in front of the museum has been renamed [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=woz+way,+san+jose,+ca&t=h&ll=37.326361,-121.891733&spn=0.003686,0.008497&t=h ''Woz Way''] in his honor). 

In September 2000, Steve Wozniak was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].

In 2001, Woz co-founded [[Wheels Of Zeus]] (note the [[acronym]], "WoZ"), to create wireless GPS technology to "help everyday people find everyday things". In the same year, he joined the Board of Directors of [[Ripcord (company)|Ripcord Networks, Inc.]] joining [[Ellen Hancock]], [[Gil Amelio]], [[Mike Connor]], and WoZ co-founder [[Alex Fielding]], all Apple Alumni in a new telecommunications venture. Later the same year he joined the Board of Directors of [[Danger (company)|Danger, Inc.]], the maker of the [[Danger Hiptop|HipTop]] (aka SideKick from T-Mobile). In May of 2004, upon nomination by Dr. Tom Miller, Woz received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from [[North Carolina State University]] for his contribution to the field of personal computing.

In 2005, Woz was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from [[Kettering University]], in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]]. He also received an honorary Doctor of Science from [[Nova Southeastern University]], Fort Lauderdale, Florida  

In 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed, and Wozniak co-founded [[Acquicor Technology]], a shell company for acquiring technology companies and developing them, with Apple alumni [[Ellen Hancock]] and [[Gil Amelio]].

In September 2006, [[W. W. Norton]] released his autobiography, ''iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It '' (ISBN 0-393-06143-4).

==Popular culture==
*An [[aphorism]] attributed to Wozniak, "Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window," is quoted in the game ''[[Civilization IV]]'' when players discover the "[[Computer]]" technology during single player games.
*In the movie ''[[Camp Nowhere]]'', [[Christopher Lloyd]]'s character scams parents into sending their kids to a computer camp under the fake name of Steve Wozniak.

*[[MC Lars]] references Wozniak in his song "Ahab."

==Current activities==
Woz is a member of the [http://www.bayareaseg.com Bay Area Segway Enthusiasts] and a [[Segway Polo]] team member. His play style is described as aggressive.

Woz and the Silicon Valley Aftershocks were challenged to a game by the newly formed New Zealand Pole Blacks; the match ended in a 2-2 tie, with the Woz Challenge Cup staying in Auckland. The Pole Blacks will visit the U.S. in 2007 to defend the cup.

==Trivia==
{{too much trivia}}
* In [[1973]], Wozniak started a Dial-a-Joke line, which he says was the first in the [[San Francisco]] area, running it from his home. As he is Polish-American, he figured no one would object if he told Polish jokes, but legal threats from the [[Polish American Congress]] caused him to switch to Italian jokes for a while. He switched back only after the Polish American Congress sued [[Steve Allen (comedian)|Steve Allen]] for telling Polish jokes and lost.<ref name="iwoz" />
* He met his first wife by responding to a Dial-a-Joke call "live," as he often did for fun, saying, "I bet I can hang up faster than you" and then hanging up. She called back, they chatted, and he asked her out.<ref name="letters04">http://www.woz.org/letters/general/04.html</ref><ref name="iwoz" />
* Wozniak is also known as a prankster. He has been known to pay for services using a $2 note from a "pad" of money&mdash;he buys uncut sheets of bills from the Treasury and has them bound into booklets; they are fully legal tender despite their perforated edges. On one occasion, this got him into a spot of trouble at a casino in Las Vegas. <ref name="letters78">http://www.woz.org/letters/general/78.html</ref>
* He plays the [[guitar]].
* Wozniak took an interest in [[laser pointer]]s, essentially starting a nationwide trend by giving them to his friends and students, and is accordingly very knowledgeable on the subject (he possesses, quite literally, "all the colors of the rainbow"). <ref>http://www.twit.tv/40</ref>
* Wozniak often signs mail with "TV is Wakezone" or "OK a new size TV", which are [[anagram]]s of his name.{{citeneeded}}
* Wozniak drives a [[Toyota]] [[Prius]] and a [[Hummer]]. He says that the two vehicles cancel each other out on an environmental level.
* He was the first consumer to buy a [[Segway PT]]<ref name="iwoz" /><ref>Statement made by Wozniak in an interview on [[Buzz Out Loud]], [[September 15]], [[2006]]</ref>
* On his birth certificate, Steve's name appears as "Stephan Wozniak" due to a typographical error. His parents intended to name him "Stephen", so that is the name he uses now.<ref name="iwoz" />
* Wozniak also claims to carry $20,000 with him at all times.<ref name="diggnation_20061109">Diggnation Podcast, [[November 09]], [[2006]]</ref>
