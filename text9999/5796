The '''moa'''<ref>In [[M<U+0101>ori language|M<U+0101>ori]] words do not use ''s'' to indicate plural, and thus "moa" is both plural and singular. Some English speakers apply this rule to their use of the word within English, although others use the regularly formed English plural "moas".</ref><ref>In some other Polynesian languages ([[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Cook Islands Maori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]]...), "moa" is the generic name for chicken, fowl ([http://www.farevanaa.pf/dictionnaire.php Dictionary of the Tahitian Academy {fr/ty}]; Jasper Buse, Raututi Taringa, "Cook islands Maori Dictionary" (1995); [http://www.samoalive.com/M.htm Samoan lexicon])</ref> were eleven [[species]] (in six genera)<ref name="bird.org.nz">http://www.bird.org.nz/nzrbn.htm</ref> of flightless [[bird]]s endemic to [[New Zealand]]. The two largest species, ''Dinornis robustus'' and ''Dinornis novaezelandiae'', reached about {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height with neck outstretched, and weighed about {{convert|230|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Davies">Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003)</ref> 

Moa are members of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Struthioniformes]] (or [[ratite]]s) although some sources also recognise these as the separate [[Order (biology)|order]] Dinornithiformes.<ref name="bird.org.nz"/> The eleven<ref name="bird.org.nz"/> species of moa are the only wingless birds, lacking even the vestigial wings which all other [[ratite]]s have. They were the dominant [[herbivore]]s in New Zealand forest, shrubland and subalpine [[ecosystems]] for thousands of years, and until the arrival of the [[M<U+0101>ori]] were hunted only by the [[Haast's Eagle]]. It is generally considered that most, if not all, species of Moa died out by Maori hunting and habitat decline before [[Age of Discovery|European discovery]] and settlement.

==Taxonomy==
[[Image:Kiwi, ostrich, Dinornis.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of a [[kiwi]], [[ostrich]], and ''[[Dinornis]]'', each with its egg]] 
The [[kiwi]] were formerly regarded as the closest relatives of the moa, but comparisons of their DNA in a paper published in 2005 suggested moa were more closely related to the Australian [[emu]] and [[cassowary]].<ref name="Turvey">Turvey ''et al.'' 2005</ref> However research published in 2010 found that the moa's closest cousins were not the emu and cassowary but smaller terrestrial South American birds called the [[tinamou]]s which are able to fly.<ref name="Phillips">Phillips ''et al.'' 2010</ref>

Although dozens of species were described in the late 19th century and early 20th century, many were based on partial skeletons and turned out to be [[Synonym (zoology)|synonyms]]. Currently, eleven species are formally recognised, although recent studies using [[ancient DNA]] recovered from bones in museum collections suggest that distinct lineages exist within some of these. One factor that has caused much confusion in moa taxonomy is the intraspecific variation of bone sizes, between glacial and inter-glacial periods (see [[Bergmann<U+2019>s rule]] and [[Allen<U+2019>s rule]]) as well as [[sexual dimorphism]] being evident in several species. ''[[Dinornis]]'' seems to have had the most pronounced [[sexual dimorphism]], with females being up to 150%  as tall and 280% as heavy as males&mdash;so much bigger that they were formerly classified as separate species until 2003.<ref name="Huynen">Huynen, L. J.,''et al.'' (2003)</ref><ref name="Bunce">Bunce, M., ''et al.'' (2003)</ref> 

Although moa were traditionally reconstructed in an upright position to create impressive height, analysis of their vertebral articulation indicates that they probably carried their heads forward,<ref name="WH">Worthy & Holdaway '2002</ref> in the manner of a kiwi. This would have allowed them to graze on low-level vegetation, while being able to lift their heads and browse trees when necessary.

[[Ancient DNA]] analyses have determined that there were a number of cryptic evolutionary lineages in several moa genera. These may eventually be classified as species or subspecies; ''Megalapteryx benhami'' (Archey) which is synonymised with ''M. didinus'' (Owen) because the bones of both share all essential characters. Size differences can be explained by a north-south [[cline]] combined with temporal variation such that specimens were larger during the Otiran glacial period (the last ice age in New Zealand). Similar temporal size variation is known for the North Island ''Pachyornis mappini''.<ref>Worthy 1987</ref> Some of the other 'Large' ranges in variation for moa species can probably be explained by similar geographic and temporal factors.<ref>Worthy ''et al.'' 1988</ref>

Sometimes, the Dinornithidae are considered to be a full [[order (biology)|order]] (Dinornithiformes), in which case the [[subfamily|subfamilies]] listed below would be advanced to full [[family (biology)|family]] status (replacing "-inae" with "-idae").

==Regional faunas==
Analyses of fossil moa bone assemblages <ref name="WH" /><ref>Worthy, T. H. (1998)a</ref><ref>Worthy, T. H. (1998)b</ref><ref>Worthy, T. H. & Holdaway, R. N. (1993)</ref><ref>Worthy, T. H. & Holdaway, R. N. (1994)</ref><ref>Worthy, T. H. & Holdaway, R. N. (1995)</ref><ref>Worthy, T. H. & Holdaway, R. N. (1996)</ref> have provided detailed data on the habitat preferences of individual moa species, and revealed distinctive regional moa faunas:

===South Island===
[[File:Hunting Moa - rotated.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''Dinornis giganteus'' and ''Pachyornis elephantopus'', both from the South Island]] 
The two main faunas identified in the South Island include: 1. The fauna of the high rainfall west coast beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'') forests that included ''Anomalopteryx didiformis'' and ''Dinornis giganteus''; and 2. The fauna of the dry rainshadow forest and shrublands east of the [[Southern Alps]] that included ''Pachyornis elephantopus'', ''Euryapteryx gravis'', ''Emeus crassus'' and ''Dinornis robustus''. The two other moa species that existed in the South Island; ''Pachyornis australis'' and ''Megalapteryx didinus'' might be included in a <U+2018>[[subalpine]] fauna<U+2019>, along with the widespread ''Dinornis robustus''. ''P. australis'' is the rarest of the moa species, and the only one yet to have been found in Maori middens. Its bones have been found in caves in the northwest [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Karamea]] districts (such as [[Honeycomb Hill Cave]]), and some sites around the [[Wanaka]] district. ''M. didinus'' is more widespread. Its name <U+2018>upland moa<U+2019> reflects the fact its bones are commonly found in the subalpine zone. However, it also occurred down to sea level where there was suitable steep and rocky terrain (such as [[Punakaiki]] on the west coast and [[Central Otago]]).

===North Island===
Significantly less is known about North Island paleofaunas, due to a paucity of fossil sites compared to the South Island; however, the basic pattern of moa-habitat relationships were the same.<ref name="WH" /> Although the South Island and the North Island shared some moa species (''Euryapteryx gravis'', ''Anomalopteryx didiformis''), most were exclusive to one island, reflecting divergence over several thousand years since lower sea level had resulted in a land bridge across [[Cook Strait]]. In the North Island, ''Dinornis novaezealandiae'' and ''Anomalopteryx didiformis'' dominated in high rainfall forest habitat; a similar pattern to the South Island. The other moa species present in the North Island (''Euryapteryx gravis'', ''E. curtus'', and ''Pachyornis geranoides'') tended to inhabit drier forest and shrubland habitats. ''P. geranoides'' occurred throughout the North Island, while the distributions of ''E. gravis'' and ''E. curtus'' were almost mutually exclusive, the former having only been found in coastal sites around the southern half of the North Island.<ref name="WH" />

==Biology==
[[File:Dinornithidae SIZE 01.png|thumb|200px|left|Size comparison between 4 moa species and a human. '''1.''' ''[[Dinornis giganteus|D. giganteus]]''. '''2.''' ''[[Emeus crassus|E.crassus]]''. '''3.''' ''[[Anomalopteryx didiformis|A. didiformis]]'' '''4.''' ''[[North Island Giant Moa|D. novaezelandiae]]'']]
It has been long suspected that the pairs of species of moa described as ''Euryapteryx curtus''/''E. exilis'', ''Emeus huttonii''/''E. crassus'', and ''Pachyornis septentrionalis''/''P. mappini'' constituted males and females, respectively. This has been confirmed by analysis for sex-specific genetic markers of DNA extracted from bone material.<ref name="Huynen" /> For example, prior to 2003 there were three species of ''Dinornis'' recognised: South Island giant moa (''D. giganteus''),  North Island giant moa (''D. novaezealandiae'') and slender moa (''D. struthioides''). However, DNA showed that all ''D. struthioides'' were in fact males, and all ''D. giganteus'' were females. Therefore the three species of ''Dinornis'' were reclassified as two species, one each formerly occurring on [[New Zealand]]'s North Island (''D. novaezealandiae'') and South Island (''D. robustus'');<ref name="Huynen" /><ref name="Bunce" /> ''robustus'' however, comprises three distinct genetic lineages and may eventually be classified as many species as discussed above.

===Diet===
[[Image:Dinornis giganteus.jpg|thumb|''Dinornis giganteus'' skull at the Museum f<U+00FC>r Naturkunde, Berlin]] 
Although feeding moa were never observed by scientists their diet has been deduced from [[fossil]]ised contents of their [[gizzard]]s,<ref>Burrows et al. 1981</ref><ref name="autogenerated3">Wood 2007</ref> [[coprolite]]s,<ref>Horrocks et al. 2004</ref> as well as indirectly through morphological analysis of skull and beak, and [[Isotope analysis|stable isotope analysis]] of their bones.<ref name="WH" /> Moa fed on a range of plant species and plant parts, including fibrous twigs and leaves taken from low trees and shrubs. The beak of ''[[Pachyornis]]'' ''elephantopus'' was analogous to a pair of [[secateur]]s, and was able to clip the fibrous leaves of New Zealand flax (''[[Phormium]]'' ''tenax'') and twigs up to at least 8mm in diameter.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Like many other birds, moa swallowed ''gizzard stones'' ([[gastrolith]]s), which were retained in their muscular gizzards, providing a grinding action that allowed them to eat coarse plant material. These stones were commonly smooth, rounded quartz pebbles, but stones over {{convert|110|mm|in|0}} in length have been found amongst preserved moa gizzard contents.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> ''Dinornis'' gizzards could often contain several kilograms of stones.<ref name="WH" />

===Locomotion===
[[Image:Moa footprints.jpg|thumb|Preserved footprints of a large moa found in 1911]]
Approximately eight moa [[fossil trackway|trackway]]s, with fossilised moa footprint impressions in fluvial silts have been found throughout the North Island, including Waikanae Creek (1872), Napier (1887), Manawatu River (1895), Marton (1896), Palmerston North (1911) (see photograph to right), Ragitikei River (1939), and underwater in Lake Taupo (1973). Analysis of the spacing of these tracks indicate walking speeds of between 3 and 5&nbsp;km/h (1.75<U+2013>3&nbsp;mph).<ref name="WH" />

===Breeding===
Examination of growth rings present in moa cortical bone has revealed that these birds were [[k-selection|K-strategists]], as are many other large endemic New Zealand birds.<ref name="Turvey" /> They are characterised by having low [[fecundity]] and a long [[maturation]] period, taking approximately ten years to reach adult size. The large ''Dinornis'' species took the same length of time to reach adult size as small moa species, and as a result had accelerated rate of skeletal growth during their juvenile years.<ref name="Turvey" />

====Eggs====
Fragments of moa eggshell are often encountered in [[archaeological]] sites and [[sand dunes]] around the [[New Zealand]] coast. Thirty six whole moa eggs exist in museum collections and vary greatly in size (from {{convert|120|-|240|mm|in}} in length and {{convert|91|-|178|mm|in}} wide).<ref>Gill 2007</ref> The outer surface of moa eggshell is characterised by small slit-shaped pores. The eggs of most moa species were white, although those of the upland moa (''Megalapteryx didinus'') were blue-green. A 2010 study by Huynen et al. has found that the eggs of certain species were fragile, only around a millimeter in thickness: "Unexpectedly, several thin-shelled eggs were also shown to belong to the heaviest moa of the genera ''Dinornis'', ''Euryapteryx'' and ''Emeus'', making these, to our knowledge, the most fragile of all avian eggs measured to date. Moreover, sex-specific DNA recovered from the outer surfaces of eggshells belonging to species of ''Dinornis'' and ''Euryapteryx'' suggest that these very thin eggs were likely to have been incubated by the lighter males. The thin nature of the eggshells of these larger species of moa, even if incubated by the male, suggests that egg breakage in these species would have been common if the typical contact method of avian egg incubation was used."<ref>Huynen, Leon, Brian J. Gill, Craig D. Millar, and David M. Lambert. "Ancient DNA Reveals Extreme Egg Morphology and Nesting Behavior in New Zealand's Extinct Moa <U+2014> PNAS." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 30 Aug. 2010. Web. 09 Sept. 2010. <http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/08/24/0914096107>.</ref> Despite the bird's extinction, the high yield of DNA available from recovered fossilized eggs has allowed the moa to have its genome sequenced.<ref>Yong, Ed. "DNA from the Largest Bird Ever Sequenced from Fossil Eggshells | Not Exactly Rocket Science | Discover Magazine." Discover Blogs | Discover Magazine. 9 Mar. 2010.

====Nests====
There is no evidence to suggest that moa were colonial nesters. While evidence of moa nesting is often inferred from accumulations of eggshell fragments found in [[caves]] and rock shelters, little evidence exists of the [[bird nest|nest]]s themselves. Excavations of rock shelters in the eastern North Island during the 1940s uncovered moa nests, which were described as "''small depressions obviously scratched out in the soft dry [[pumice]]''".<ref>Hartree 1999</ref> Moa nesting material has also been recovered from rock shelters in the [[Central Otago]] region of the South Island, where the dry climate has resulted in the preservation of plant material used to construct the nesting platform (including twigs that have been clipped by moa bills).<ref name="Wood">Wood, J. R. (2008)</ref> [[Seeds]] and [[pollen]] within moa coprolites found amongst the nesting material provide evidence that the nesting season was late spring to summer.<ref name="Wood" />

===Vocalisation===
Although there is no surviving record of what sounds moa made, some idea of their calls can be gained from fossil evidence. The [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of moa were supported by many small rings of bone known as tracheal rings. Excavation of these rings from articulated skeletons has shown that at least two moa genera (''Euryapteryx'' and ''Emeus'') exhibited tracheal elongation, that is, their trachea were up to 1 metre (3&nbsp;ft) long and formed a large loop within the body cavity.<ref name="WH" /> These are the only ratites known to exhibit this feature, which is also present in several other bird groups including [[swan]]s, [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[guinea fowl]]. The feature is associated with deep, resonant vocalisations that can travel long distances.

===Feathers and soft tissues===
[[Image:Moa foot.jpg|thumb|Preserved ''[[Megalapteryx]]'' foot, Natural History Museum]] 
[[Image:Moaupland.jpg|thumb|right|''Megalapteryx didinus'' head]]
Several remarkable examples of moa remains have been found that exhibit soft tissues ([[muscle]], [[skin]], [[feathers]]), preserved through [[desiccation]] when the bird died in a naturally dry site (for example, a cave with a constant dry breeze blowing through it). Most of these specimens have been found in the semi-arid [[Central Otago]] region, the driest part of New Zealand. These include:
* Dried muscle on bones of a female ''Dinornis robustus'' found at Tiger Hill in the [[Manuherikia River]] Valley by gold miners in 1864<ref name="Owen">Owen, R. (1879)</ref> (currently held by [[Yorkshire Museum]])
* Several bones of ''Emeus crassus'' with muscle attached, and a row of neck vertebrae with muscle, skin and feathers collected from Earnscleugh Cave near the town of Alexandra in 1870<ref>Hutton, F. W. & Coughtrey, M. (1875)</ref> (currently held by [[Otago Museum]])
*An articulated foot of a male ''Dinornis robustus'' with skin and foot pads preserved found in a crevice on the Knobby Range in 1874<ref name="Buller">Buller, W. L. (1888)</ref> (currently held by [[Otago Museum]])
* The type specimen of ''Megalapteryx didinus'' found near [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] in 1878<ref name="Owen" /> (currently held by [[Natural History Museum]], London; see photograph of foot on this page)
* The lower leg of ''Pachyornis elephantopus'' with skin and muscle from the Hector Range in 1884;<ref name="Buller" /><ref name="Anderson" /> (currently held by the Zoology Department, [[Cambridge University]])
* The complete feathered leg of a ''Megalapteryx didinus'' from Old Man Range in 1894<ref>Hamilton, A. (1894)</ref> (currently held by [[Otago Museum]])
* The head of a ''Megalapteryx didinus'' found near Cromwell sometime prior to 1949<ref>Vickers-Rich, P., ''et al.'' (1995)</ref> (currently held by the [[Museum of New Zealand]]).
Two specimens are known from outside the Central Otago region:
* A complete foot of ''Megalapteryx didinus'' found in a cave on [[Mount Owen]] near Nelson in 1980s<ref>Worthy, T. H. (1989)</ref> (currently held by the [[Museum of New Zealand]])
* A skeleton of ''Anomalopteryx didiformis'' with muscle, skin and feather bases collected from a cave near [[Te Anau]] in 1980.<ref>Forrest, R. M. (1987)</ref>
In addition to these specimens, loose moa feathers have been collected from caves and rockshelters in the southern South Island, and so some idea of the moa plumage can be gained. The preserved leg of ''Megalapteryx didinus'' from the Old Man Range reveals that this species was feathered right down to the foot. This is likely to have been an adaptation to living in high altitude snowy environments, and is also seen in the [[Darwin<U+2019>s Rhea]] which lives in a similar seasonally snowy habitat.<ref name="WH" /> Moa feathers are up to {{convert|23|cm|in|0}} long and a range of colours have been reported, including reddish brown, white, yellowish and purplish.<ref name="WH" /> Dark feathers with white or creamy tips have also been found, and indicate that some moa species may have had plumage with a speckled appearance.

==Extinction ==
[[Image:Moa mock hunt.jpg|upright|thumb|Early 20th century reconstruction of a moa hunt]] 
The moa's only predator was the massive [[Haast's Eagle]]&mdash;until the arrival of human settlers. 

The [[M<U+0101>ori]] arrived sometime before A.D. 1300, and all moa genera were soon driven to extinction by hunting and, to a lesser extent, forest clearance. By about A.D. 1400 almost all moa are generally thought to have become extinct, along with the [[Haast's Eagle]] which had relied on them for food. Recent research using [[carbon-14 dating]] of [[midden]]s strongly suggests that this took less than a hundred years,<ref>Holdaway & Jacomb 2000</ref> rather than the period of exploitation lasting several hundred years which had been earlier believed.

Some authors have speculated that a few ''Megalapteryx didinus'' may have persisted in remote corners of New Zealand until the 18th and even 19th centuries, but the view is not widely accepted.<ref name = "Anderson">Anderson 1989</ref> Some M<U+0101>ori hunters claimed to be in pursuit of the moa as late as the 1770s. Whalers and sealers recalled seeing monstrous birds along the coast of the South Island, and in the 1820s a man named George Pauley made an unverified claim of seeing a moa in the [[Otago Region]] of New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite book|url= | title=Swift as a Shadow |author=Rosamond Purcell and the staff of Naturlis | publisher=Mariner Books | page=32 | year=1999 | isbn=0395892287}}</ref><ref name="Fuller"/> An expedition in the 1850s under Lieutenant A. Impey reported two Emu-like birds on a hillside, on the South Island, and an 1861 story from the [[Nelson Examiner]] told of three-toed footprints measuring {{convert|36|cm|in}} between [[Takaka]] and [[Riwaka]], found by a surveying party, and finally in 1878 the [[Otago Witness]] published an account from a farmer and his shepherd.<ref name="Fuller"/>

== Discovery by science==
[[Image:Dinornis1387.jpg|thumb|left|Sir [[Richard Owen]] with ''Dinornis robustus'' skeleton]]
[[Joel Samuel Polack|Joel Polack]], a trader who lived on the East Coast of the North Island from 1834 to 1837, records in 1838 that he had been shown 'several large fossil ossifications' found near Mt Hikurangi. He was certain that these were the bones of a species of emu or ostrich, noting that 'the Natives add that in times long past they received the traditions that very large birds had existed, but the scarcity of animal food, as well as the easy method of entrapping them, has caused their extermination'. Polack further noted that he had received reports from M<U+0101>ori that a 'species of Struthio' still existed in remote parts of the South Island.<ref>Polack, J. S. (1838)</ref><ref>Hill, H. (1913)</ref> Dieffenbach<ref>Dieffenbach, E. (1843)</ref> also refers to a fossil from the area near Mt Hikurangi, and surmises that it belongs to 'a bird, now extinct, called Moa (or Movie) by the natives'. In 1839, [[John W. Harris]], a [[Poverty Bay]] flax trader who was a natural history enthusiast, was given a piece of unusual bone by a M<U+0101>ori who had found it in a river bank. He showed the {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} fragment of bone to his uncle, John Rule, a Sydney surgeon, who sent it to [[Richard Owen]] who at that time was working at the Hunterian Museum at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in [[London]].<ref name="Fuller"/> Owen became a noted [[biologist]], [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] at the [[British Museum]]. 

Owen puzzled over the fragment for almost four years. He established it was part of the [[femur]] of a big animal, but it was uncharacteristically light and honeycombed. Owen announced to a skeptical scientific community and the world that it was from a giant extinct bird like an [[ostrich]], and named it ''Dinornis''. His deduction was ridiculed in some quarters but was proved correct with the subsequent discoveries of considerable quantities of moa bones throughout the country, sufficient to reconstruct skeletons of the birds.<ref name="Fuller">Fuller, Errol (1987)</ref>

In July 2004, the [[Natural History Museum]] in London placed on display the moa bone fragment Owen had first examined, to celebrate 200 years since his birth, and in memory of Owen as founder of the museum.

===Moa bone deposits===
Since the discovery of the first moa bones in the late 1830s, thousands more have been found. They occur in a range of late [[Quaternary]] and [[Holocene]] [[sedimentary]] deposits, but are most common in three main types of site:

====Caves====
[[Image:Moa Cave.JPG|thumb|Moa bones scattered across the floor of 'Moa Cave', Honeycomb Hill Cave System. This cave is a closed scientific reserve.]] 
Bones are commonly found in [[Caves]] or <U+2018>tomo<U+2019> (Maori word for doline or [[sinkhole]]; often used to refer to pitfalls or vertical cave shafts). The two main ways that the moa bones were deposited in such sites were: 1. Birds that entered the cave to nest or escape bad weather, and subsequently died in the cave; and 2. Birds that fell into a vertical shaft and were unable to escape. Moa bones (and the bones of other extinct birds) have been found in caves throughout New Zealand, especially in the [[limestone]]/[[marble]] areas of northwest Nelson, [[Karamea]], [[Waitomo]] and [[Te Anau]].

====Dunes====
Moa bones and eggshell fragments sometimes occur in active coastal sand dunes, where they may erode from [[paleosol]]s and concentrate in <U+2018>[[Blowout (geology)|blowouts]]<U+2019> between dune ridges. Many such moa bones predate human settlement, although some can originate from Maori midden sites which frequently occur in dunes near harbours and river mouths (for example the large moa hunter sites at [[Shag River]], [[Otago]] and [[Wairau Bar]], [[Marlborough]]).

====Swamps/mirings====
Densely intermingled moa bones have been encountered in swamps throughout New Zealand. The most well-known example is at [[Pyramid Valley]] in north Canterbury,<ref>Holdaway, R. N. & Worthy, T. H. (1997)</ref> where bones from at least 183 individual moa have been excavated. Many explanations were proposed to account for how these deposits had formed, ranging from poisonous spring waters to floods and wildfires. However the currently accepted explanation is that the bones accumulated at a slow rate over thousands of years, from birds that had entered the swamps to feed and became trapped in the soft sediment.<ref>Wood, J.

==Claims of moa survival==
[[Image:OtagoMuseumMoa.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of two moa species, [[Otago Museum]], [[Dunedin]]. Otago Museum holds the world's largest collection of moa remains.]]
The moa is thought to be [[extinct]], but there has been occasional speculation<U+2014>since at least the late 19th century,<ref>Gould, C. (1886)</ref><ref>Heuvelmans, B (1959)</ref> and as recently as 1993<ref name="AnimalX_Moa">''Animal X classic'', 10 August 2003. This episode are uploaded on their own [[Youtube]] Channel (''http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHKbD07cbZA'').</ref><ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/moa/4/2 "A moa sighting?], Te Ara</ref><ref name = "Coleman">[http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/moa-paddy/ Coleman, Loren. 2007. "Mystery Moa Photo".]</ref><ref>[http://skeptics.org.nz/SK:VIEWARTICLE::838 "Skeptics Meet Moa Spotters"], skeptics.org.nz</ref> and 2008<ref>Laing, Doug. [http://www.hbtoday.co.nz/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3760032 Birdman says moa surviving in the Bay], ''Hawke's Bay Today'', 5 January 2008. Retrieved 23 April 2010.</ref><U+2014>that some moa may still exist, particularly in the rugged wilderness of [[Westland, New Zealand|South Westland]] and [[Fiordland]]. [[Cryptozoology|Cryptozoologists]] and others reputedly continue to search for them,<ref>[http://www.newanimal.org/moas.htm Hall, Jamie. 2006. "The Cryptid Zoo: Moas and Other Giant Flightless Birds"].</ref> but their claims and supporting evidence (such as of purported footprints<ref name="autogenerated2">Laing, 2008</ref> or blurry photos<ref name = "Coleman">[http://www.cryptomundo.com/cryptozoo-news/moa-paddy/ Coleman, Loren. 2007. "Mystery Moa Photo".]</ref>) have earned little attention from mainstream experts, and are widely considered [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].<ref name = "Anderson"/>

The rediscovery of the [[takah<U+0113>]] in 1948 after none had been seen since 1898 showed that rare birds may exist undiscovered for a long time. However, the takah<U+0113> is a much smaller bird than the moa, and was rediscovered after its tracks were identified&mdash;yet no reliable evidence of moa tracks has ever been found, and experts still contend that moa survival is extremely unlikely, since this would involve the ground-dwelling birds living unnoticed in a region visited often by [[hunter]]s and [[hiker]]s.<ref name="autogenerated2" />
