It began as an operation to improve U.S.-Iranian relations, wherein [[Israel]] would ship weapons to a relatively moderate, politically influential group of [[Iran]]ians; the U.S. would then resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised to do everything in their power to achieve the release of six U.S. hostages, who were being held by the Lebanese [[Shia]] [[Islamist]] group [[Hezbollah]], who were unknowingly connected to the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution]]. The plan eventually deteriorated into an arms-for-hostages scheme, in which members of the [[executive branch]] sold weapons to Iran in exchange for the release of the American hostages.<ref name="tce"/><ref name="reagan no-bbc"/> Large modifications to the plan were conjured by Lieutenant Colonel [[Oliver North]] of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-[[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] and [[anti-communist]] rebels, or Contras, in Nicaragua.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hart, Robert|title=NYT's apologies miss the point|publisher=The Consortium for Independent Journalism, Inc|date=June 2, 2004|url=http://www.consortiumnews.com/2004/060204.html|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> While President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause,<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 542</ref> no evidence has been found showing that he authorized this plan.<ref name="tce"/><ref name="reagan no-bbc">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/213195.stm|title=Reagan's mixed White House legacy|date=June 6, 2004|accessdate=2008-04-22|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="report sum">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/PS157/assignment%20files%20public/congressional%20report%20key%20sections.htm|title=The Iran-Contra Report|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=The American Presidency Project}}</ref>

==The affair==
The affair was composed of arms sales to Iran, and funding of Contra militants in Nicaragua. Direct funding of the Nicaraguan rebels had been made illegal through the [[Boland Amendment]]<ref name="report sum">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/PS157/assignment%20files%20public/congressional%20report%20key%20sections.htm|title=The Iran-Contra Report|accessdate=2008-05-17|publisher=The American Presidency Project}}</ref> the name given to three U.S. legislative amendments between 1982 and 1984, all aimed at limiting US government assistance to the rebel Contras in Nicaragua.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Middle East was faced with frequent hostage-taking incidents by hostile organizations. In 1979, Iranian students [[Iran hostage crisis|took hostage]] 52 employees of the United States embassy in Iran. On January 20, 1981, the day [[Ronald Reagan]] became President, the hostages were freed following the [[Algiers Accords]]. Hostage taking continued following the imprisonment of members of [[Al-Dawa]], an exiled Iraqi political party turned militant organization, for their part in a series of truck bombs in [[Kuwait]] in 1983. [[Hezbollah]], an ally of Al-Dawa, [[Lebanon hostage crisis|took 30 Western hostages]] between 1982 and 1992, many of whom were American.<ref>{{cite news| last = Seden| first = Gil  | title = Who is Hezbollah? | date = July 14, 2006 | url =http://www.ajn.com.au/news/news.asp?pgID=1113|accessdate=2008-06-11|work=The Australian Jewish News}}</ref>

===Arms transactions===

In 1985, President Reagan entered [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] for [[colon cancer]] surgery. While the President was recovering in the hospital, McFarlane met with him and told him that Representatives from Israel had contacted the [[National Security Agency]] to pass on confidential information from a sect of moderate, politically influential Iranians opposed to the Ayatollah.<ref name="rr-504">Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 504</ref> These Iranians sought to establish a quiet relationship with the United States, before establishing formal relationships upon the death of the Ayatollah.<ref name="rr-504"/> McFarlane told Reagan that the Iranians, to demonstrate their seriousness, offered to persuade the Hezbollah terrorists to release the seven U.S. hostages.<ref name="rr-505">Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 505</ref> Reagan allowed McFarlane to meet with the Israeli intermediaries because he believed that establishing relations with a strategically located country, and preventing the [[Soviet Union]] from doing the same, was a beneficial move.<ref name="rr-504"/><ref>[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_24.htm Walsh Iran / Contra Report - Chapter 24 The Investigation of State Department Officials: Shultz, Hill and Platt<!-- Bot generated title -->] Retrieved on [[2008-06-07]]</ref>

====First arms sale====
In July 1985, Israel sent American-made [[BGM-71 TOW]] antitank missiles to Iran through an arms dealer named [[Manucher Ghorbanifar]], a friend of [[Prime Minister of Iran|Iran's Prime Minister]]. Hours after receiving the weapons, the [[Islamic fundamentalist]] group [[Islamic Jihad Organization|Islamic Jihad]], that later evolved into [[Hezbollah]], released one hostage they had been holding in Lebanon, the Reverend [[Benjamin Weir]].<ref name="JVL"/>

====Arrow Air 1285 crash====
{{main|Arrow Air Flight 1285}}
After a botched delivery of [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] missiles, and a failed London meeting between McFarlane and Manucher Ghorbanifar, [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]], a plane containing nearly 250 American servicemen, crashed in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] on December 12, 1985. On the day of the crash, responsibility was claimed by the [[Islamic Jihad Organization]], a wing of Hezbollah that had taken credit for the kidnapping of the very Americans in Lebanon whom the Reagan administration sought to have released.<ref>{{cite news|author=Watson, Laurie|title=Errors By Crew Reportedly Cited In Gander Crash|publisher=''The Philadelphia Inquirer''|work=United Press International|date=November 6, 1988|page=A33|accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref> The crash came on the fourth anniversary of another attack for which Islamic Jihad took credit: the near-simultaneous bombings of [[1983 Kuwait bombings|six targets in Kuwait]], the French and American Embassies among them. Members of Hezbollah had participated in, and were jailed for, those attacks, but most of the conspirators were members of al-Dawa.  The accident was investigated by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB), and was determined to have been caused by the aircraft's unexpectedly high drag and reduced lift condition, which was most likely due to ice contamination<ref name=cbc>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/12/12/Air-Arrow-051212.html|title=Ceremonies mark anniversary of deadly Newfoundland air crash|publisher=CBC|date=December 12, 2005|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>, although a minority report stated as part of its conclusions that "Fire broke out on board while the aircraft was in flight, possibly due to a detonation in a cargo compartment"

====Modifications in plans====

Two days later, Reagan met with his advisors at the White House, where a new plan was introduced. This one called for a slight change in the arms transactions: instead of the weapons going to the moderate Iranian group, they would go to moderate Iranian army leaders.<ref name="rr-510">Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 510</ref> As the weapons were delivered from Israel by air, the hostages held by Hezbollah would be released.<ref name="rr-510"/> Israel would still pay the United States for reimbursing the weapons. Though staunchly opposed by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[George Shultz]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Caspar Weinberger]], the plan was authorized by Reagan, who stated that, "We were ''not'' trading arms for hostages, nor were we negotiating with terrorists."<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 512</ref> Now retired National Security Advisor McFarlane flew to London to meet with Israelis and Ghorbanifar in an attempt to persuade the Iranian to use his influence to release the hostages before any arms transactions occurred; this plan was rejected by Ghorbanifar.<ref name="rr-510"/>

On the day of McFarlane's resignation, [[Oliver North]], a military aide to the [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC), proposed a new plan for selling arms to Iran, which included two major adjustments: instead of selling arms through Israel, the sale was to be direct, and a portion of the proceeds would go to [[Contras]], or Nicaraguan [[guerilla warfare|guerilla fighters]] opposed to communism, at a markup. North proposed a $15 million markup, while contracted arms broker Ghorbanifar added a 41% markup of his own.<ref name="walsh"/> Other members of the NSC were in favor of North's plan; with large support, Poindexter authorized it without notifying President Reagan, and it went into effect.<ref name="Avery">{{cite web|last=Avery|first=Steve|title=Irangate: Iran-Contra affair, 1985-1992|publisher=U-S-History.com|year=2005|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1889.html|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> At first, the Iranians refused to buy the arms at the inflated price because of the excessive markup imposed by North and Ghorbanifar. They eventually relented, and in February 1986, 1,000 TOW missiles were shipped to the country.<ref name="Avery"/> From May to November 1986, there were additional shipments of miscellaneous weapons and parts.<ref name="Avery"/>

Both the sale of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, attempted to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the [[Boland Amendment]].<ref name="report sum"/> Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting the funds for the Contras, or any affair, the President (or in this case the administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments.<ref name = fisher>{{cite journal|author=Fisher, Louis| title=How Tightly Can Congress Draw the Purse Strings?|journal=American Journal of International Law|volume=83|issue=4|pages=758<U+2013>766|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9300(198910)83%3A4%3C758%3AHTCCDT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N|accessdate=2006-10-10|month=October|year=1989|doi=10.2307/2203364}}</ref> Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, [[Fawn Hall]], transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number.

On January 7, 1986, John Poindexter proposed to the president a modification of the approved plan: instead of negotiating with the moderate Iranian political group, the U.S. would negotiate with moderate members of the Iranian government.<ref name="rr-512">Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 516</ref> Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government, so with the hope of the release of the hostages, Reagan approved this plan as well.<ref name="rr-512"/> Throughout February 1986, weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States (as part of Oliver North's plan, without the knowledge of President Reagan) and none of the hostages were released. Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage, this one to [[Tehran, Iran|Tehran]]. He met directly with the moderate Iranian political group that sought to establish U.S.-Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages.<ref name="rr-520,21">Reagan, Ronald (1990), pp. 520-521</ref> This meeting also failed. The members requested demands such as Israel's withdrawal from the [[Golan Heights]], which the United States rejected.<ref name="rr-520,21"/>

====Subsequent dealings====
In late July 1986, Hezbollah released another hostage, Father Lawrence Martin Jenco, former head of Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon. Following this, [[William Casey]], head of the CIA, requested that the U.S. authorize sending a shipment of small missile parts to Iranian military forces as a way of expressing gratitude.<ref name="rr-523"/> Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face, or be executed, and hostages killed. Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur.<ref name="rr-523">Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 523</ref>

In September and October 1986 three more Americans <U+2014> Frank Reed, Joseph Ciccipio, Edward Tracy <U+2014> were abducted in Lebanon by a separate terrorist group. The reasons for their abduction are unknown, although it is speculated that they were kidnapped to replace the freed Americans.<ref>Ranstorp, Magnus, Hizb'allah in Lebanon: The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis, New York, St. Martins Press, 1997 pp. 98-99</ref> One more original hostage, David Jacobsen, was later released.

<blockquote>"My purpose was... to send a signal that the United States was prepared to replace the animosity between [the U.S. and Iran] with a new relationship...

The most significant step which Iran could take, we indicated, would be to use its influence in Lebanon to secure the release of all hostages held there."<ref name=reaganspeech /></blockquote>

The scandal was compounded when [[Oliver North]] destroyed or hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, [[Fawn Hall]], testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC) documents from the White House.

During the trial North testified that on November 21, 22, or 24, he witnessed Poindexter destroy what may have been the only signed copy of a presidential covert-action finding that sought to authorize CIA participation in the November 1985 [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk missile]] shipment to Iran.<ref name="walsh"/> [[United States Attorney General|US Attorney General]] [[Edwin Meese]] admitted on November 25 that profits from weapons sales to Iran were made available to assist the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

In his expose ''Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987'', journalist [[Bob Woodward]] chronicles the role of the CIA in facilitating the transfer of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras spearheaded by Oliver North.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Woodward |title=VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987 |year=1987 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York }}  </ref>  Then Director of the CIA, [[William J.

On May 6, 1987 William Casey died the day after Congress began its public hearings on the Iran-contra affair.

==Tower Commission==
On November 25, 1986, President Reagan announced the creation of a Special Review Board to look into the matter; the following day, he appointed former Senator [[John Tower]], former Secretary of State [[Edmund Muskie]], and former National Security Adviser [[Brent Scowcroft]] to serve as members. This [[Presidential Commission (United States)|Presidential Commission]] took effect on December 1 and became known as the "Tower Commission". The main objectives of the commission were to inquire into "the circumstances surrounding the Iran-Contra matter, other case studies that might reveal strengths and weaknesses in the operation of the National Security Council system under stress, and the manner in which that system has served eight different Presidents since its inception in 1947."<ref name="tce">{{cite web|title=Tower commission report excerpts|work=The Tower Commission Report|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/PS157/assignment%20files%20public/TOWER%20EXCERPTS.htm|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> The commission was the first presidential commission to review and evaluate the National Security Council.

President Reagan appeared before the Tower Commission on December 2, 1986, to answer questions regarding his involvement in the affair. When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals, he first stated that he had; later, he appeared to contradict himself by stating that he had no recollection of doing so.<ref name="tcr-time">{{cite news|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963668,00.html|title=Tower of Judgement|author=Church, George J|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> In his 1990 autobiography, ''[[An American Life]]'', Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel.<ref>Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 501</ref>

The report published by the Tower Commission was delivered to the President on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme,<ref name="tce"/> including Reagan, and two of the arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi.<ref name="tcr-time"/> The 200 page report was the most comprehensive of any released,<ref name="tcr-time"/> criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially not the diversion of funds to the Contras,<ref name="tce"/> although it argued that the President ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff.<ref name="tce"/> The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions.<ref name="tce"/> A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more power in the hands of that chair.<ref name="tce"/>

The Democratic-controlled [[United States Congress]] issued its own report on November 18, 1987, stating that "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have."<ref name="reagan no-bbc"/> The congressional report wrote that the president bore "ultimate responsibility" for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited "secrecy, deception and disdain for the law."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,5211614-103677,00.html|title=Nixon's Empire Strikes Back|author=Blumenthal, Sidney|work=The Guardian|date=June 9, 2005|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> It also read in part: "The central remaining question is the role of the President in the Iran-contra affair. On this critical point, the shredding of documents by Poindexter, North and others, and the death of Casey, leave the record incomplete."<ref name="report sum"/>

==Aftermath==
Reagan expressed regret regarding the situation during a nationally televised address from the White House Oval Office on March 4, 1987; Reagan had not spoken to the American people directly for three months amidst the scandal.<ref name="pbs-speech">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/filmmore/reference/primary/irancontra.html|title=Speech about Iran Contra|date=March 4, 1987|accessdate=2008-04-23|publisher=PBS}}</ref> President Reagan told the American people the reason why he did not update them on the scandal:

<blockquote>"The reason I haven't spoken to you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as frustrating as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that."<ref name="pbs-speech"/></blockquote>

He then took full responsibility for the acts committed:
<blockquote>"First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior."<ref name="pbs-speech"/></blockquote>

Finally, the president stated that his previous assertions that the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages were incorrect:
<blockquote>"A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind."<ref name="pbs-speech"/></blockquote>

Domestically, the scandal precipitated a drop in President Reagan's popularity as his approval ratings saw "the largest single drop for any U.S. president in history", from 67% to 46% in November 1986, according to a ''New York Times''/CBS News poll.<ref>[[Jean Mayer|Mayer, Jane]] and [[Doyle McManus]], ''Landslide: The Unmaking of The President, 1984-1988''. Houghton Mifflin, (1988) p.292 and 437</ref>  The "Teflon President", as Reagan was nicknamed by critics,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=235102|accessdate=2008-06-10|publisher=''The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel''|work=The Washington Post|date=June 7, 2004|title=Teflon president not a compliment}}</ref> survived the scandal, however, and by January 1989 a Gallup poll was "recording a 64% approval rating," the highest ever recorded for a departing President at that time.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/DailyNews/poll_reagan010806.html|title=Improving With Age: Reagan Approval Grows Better in Retrospect|author=Sussman, Dalia|date=2001-08-06 |publisher=ABC|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>

Internationally the damage was more severe. [[Magnus Ranstorp]] wrote, "U.S. willingness to engage in concessions with Iran and the Hezbollah not only signalled to its adversaries that hostage-taking was an extremely useful instrument in extracting political and financial concessions for the West but also undermined any credibility of U.S. criticism of other states' deviation from the principles of no-negotiation and no concession to terrorists and their demands.<ref>Ranstorp, Magnus, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon: The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis'', New York, St. Martins Press, 1997 p.203</ref>

In Iran [[Mehdi Hashemi]], the leaker of the scandal, was executed in 1987, allegedly for activities unrelated to the scandal. Though Hashemi made a full video confession to numerous serious charges, some observers find the coincidence of his leak and the subsequent prosecution highly suspicious.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', University of California, (1999), pp 162-166</ref>

===Convictions, pardons, and reinstatements===
Oliver North and John Poindexter were [[indicted]] on multiple charges on March 16, 1988.<ref name = indictment>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0716F63B5B0C748DDDAA0894D0484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fP%2fPoindexter%2c%20John%20M%2e|title=North, Poindexter and 2 Others Indicted on Iran-Contra Fraud and Theft Charges|author=Shenon, Philip|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> North, indicted on 16 counts, was found guilty by a jury of three minor counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal on the grounds that North's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], lying to Congress, [[obstruction of justice]], and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. [[Arthur L. Liman]] served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran-Contra Affair.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEED71E38F93BA25754C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Arthur L. Liman, a Masterly Lawyer, Dies at 64|author=Haberman, Clyde|date=July 18, 1997|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref>

The [[Independent Counsel]], [[Lawrence E. Walsh]], chose not to re-try North or Poindexter. [[Caspar Weinberger]] was indicted for lying to the Independent Counsel but was later pardoned by President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite news|date=December 25, 1992|accessdate=2008-06-06|title=Bush Pardons 6 in Iran Affair, Aborting a Weinberger Trial; Prosecutor Assails 'Cover-Up'|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/iran-pardon.html|author=Johnston, David}}</ref>

In 1992 George H. W. Bush pardoned six convicted administration officials, namely [[Elliott Abrams]], Duane R. Clarridge, Alan Fiers, Clair George, Robert McFarlane, and Caspar Weinberger.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=George H.W.|title=Proclamation 6518 - Grant of Executive Clemency|publisher=The American Presidency Project|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=20265|date=December 24, 1992|accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref>

[[George W. Bush]] selected some individuals that served under Reagan for high-level posts in his presidential administration.<ref name = guardianapp>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/bush/story/0,7369,469208,00.html|title=Bush nominees under fire for link with contras|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|author=Campbell, Duncan|accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref><ref name = guardianapp2>{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,856095,00.html|title=Return of the Iran-Contra brigade|publisher=''[[The Observer]]''|accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref> They include:

*Admiral [[John Poindexter]]:<ref name = pdappointment>{{cite news|title=No more Mr Scrupulous Guy|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4358017,00.html|author=Sutherland, John|publisher= [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> under Bush, Director of the [[Information Awareness Office]]; in Iran-Contra, found guilty of multiple felony counts for conspiracy, obstruction of justice, lying to Congress, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence, convictions reversed.

In Poindexter's hometown of [[Odon, Indiana]], a street was renamed to John Poindexter Street. Bill Breeden, a former minister, stole the street's sign in protest of the Iran-Contra Affair. He claimed that he was holding it for a ransom of $30 million, in reference to the amount of money given to Iran to transfer to the Contras. He was later arrested and confined to prison, making him, as satirized by [[Howard Zinn]], "the only person to be imprisoned as a result of the Iran-Contra affair."<ref>Zinn, Howard (2003), pp. 587-588</ref>
