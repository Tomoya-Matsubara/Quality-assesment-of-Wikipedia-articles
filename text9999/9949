'''Londonthorpe''' is a satellite village of [[Grantham]], in the [[South Kesteven]] district of  [[Lincolnshire]], England. The village is in the [[civil parish]] of Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without. It lies {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} to the north-east from Grantham, {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} to the west from the [[B6403 road|B6403]] ([[Ermine Street]] Roman road), and borders on [[Belton House#Gardens and the park|Belton Park]] in the west.

The Londonthorpe name may derive from the Old Scandinavian ''lundr+thorp''; in the ''[[Domesday]]'' account the village was written as "Lundertorp".<ref>Marrat, W.
