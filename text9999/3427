'''''Live Free or Die Hard''''' (released as '''''Die Hard 4.0''''' or '''''Die Hard 4''''' outside North America and also known as '''''Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard''''') is the fourth installment in the ''[[Die Hard]]'' [[film series]]. The film was directed by [[Len Wiseman]] and stars [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]], the [[protagonist]] of the first three films. Other cast members included [[Justin Long]], [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], and [[Maggie Q]]. The storyline takes place 19 years after the first film, and sees McClane face a gang of [[Cyber-terrorism|cyber terrorists]]. The film was based on the [[1997]] article "A Farewell to Arms" written for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine by John Carlin.<ref name="IMDBCast">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/fullcredits#writers|title=Full cast and crew for Live Free or Die Hard (2007)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref> The film's North American release date was [[June 27]], [[2007]].<ref name="IMDBRelease">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/releaseinfo|title=Release dates for Live Free or Die Hard (2007)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref>

After the project was initially stalled due to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], production eventually began, and the film's title was switched several times. A variety of visual effects were used for action sequences, even though Wiseman and Willis stated that they wanted to limit the amount of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in the film. In separate incidents during filming, both Willis and [[Larry Rippenkroeger|his stunt double]] were injured. Unlike the prior three films in the series, the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|North American rating]] was PG-13 rather than R. 

''Live Free or Die Hard'' received generally positive reviews, earning a 80% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and 69/100 from [[Metacritic]] and had total international box office gross receipts of $381.4 million. For the DVD release, [[20th Century Fox]] pioneered a new kind of [[Digital rights management|DRM]] that tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to [[ripping|rip]] discs by offering them a downlodable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The [[film score|score]] for the film was released on [[July 2]], [[2007]] and a video game has been proposed for the [[Xbox 360]].

==Plot==
At the start of the film, a terrorist breaches an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] facility's computer system, and computer hackers are assassinated by the terrorist mastermind Thomas Gabriel ([[Timothy Olyphant]]), instead of being paid for their collaboration. The FBI, unaware of the killings, dispatches [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Police Detective [[John McClane]] ([[Bruce Willis]]) to visit a known hacker, Matthew Farrell ([[Justin Long]]), who is also assisting Gabriel, as part of their investigation regarding the breach. Gabriel's henchmen attempt to assassinate McClane and Farrell, but their targets escape. McClane transports Farrell to the FBI's Washington DC headquarters and its head, Assistant Director Bowman ([[Cliff Curtis]]), in the midst of a shutdown of the traffic system in DC. The stock market is manipulated shortly afterward, causing it to crash.

McClane is ordered to take Farrell into protective custody and Gabriel sends more henchmen to kill the pair. McClane and Farrell evade their assassins again and, as the country's infrastructure is threatened with a major break down, Farrell tells McClane the terrorists are initiating a [[fire sale]] and that major utilities would be next. The detective and the hacker travel to a power hub in West Virginia to defend it, finding that the terrorists are already there. McClane battles terrorists while Farrell undoes the damage done to the computer system. They are contacted by Gabriel, who finds out that McClane has killed his lover Mai Lihn ([[Maggie Q]]) and angrily re-routes gas lines to destroy the hub in a gas explosion. McClane and Farrell escape once more, and on Farrell's advice, the pair visit his hacker friend the Warlock ([[Kevin Smith]]) for help. At the Warlock's home, they find out about Gabriel's background and attempt to hack into the terrorist's systems.  Gabriel contacts the detective at the Warlock's home via webcam and shows that he has McClane's daughter Lucy ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]) as a hostage. While McClane distracts Gabriel in conversation, Warlock determines Gabriel's location, at a hijacked NSA building.

McClane and Farrell travel to the NSA building. The detective combats the terrorists while Farrell discovers and tries to undo Gabriel's plan to steal backup financial information from servers in the building. Farrell is able to lock the terrorists out of their server hack, rendering the task incomplete, and then he is taken hostage by the terrorists. With McClane after them, Gabriel and his henchmen flee the building with their hostages. McClane manages to hijack one of the escaping trucks and pursues Gabriel and the hostages. Gabriel renders a hack to deceive the pilot of a [[F-35 Lightning II]] jet to attack McClane's truck. The jet engages McClane, destroying much of the freeway in the process, but the detective is able to escape. He tracks Gabriel to a warehouse, where the terrorist is forcing Farrell to undo the encryption at gunpoint. McClane and Farrell are able to kill Gabriel and his men before they force Farrell to decrypt the lock, resolving the crisis. The FBI arrives shortly after to tend to the wounds of Farrell, McClane and his daughter. The final shot is McClane and his daughter leaving in an ambulance.

===Visual effects===
For the visual effects used throughout the film, actor Bruce Willis and director Len Wiseman stated that they wanted to use a limited amount of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].<ref name="ComSoon3">{{cite news|last=Douglas|first=Edward|title= Bruce Willis Gets a Second Life!|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=20922|publisher=[http://www.comingsoon.net ComingSoon.net]|date=[[June 14]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref> One VFX producer said that "Len was insisting on the fact that, because we<U+2019>ve got ''[[Transformers (2007 film)|Transformers]]'' and other big CG movies coming out, this one has to feel more real.

Digital Dimension worked on 200 visual effects shots in the film,<ref name="CGSociety">{{cite news|title=Digital Dimension creates explosive effects for <U+2018>Live Free Or Die Hard<U+2019>|url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4138|publisher=[http://www.cgsociety.org/ CGSociety.org]|date=[[July 1]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref> including the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands on top of the other cars. To achieve this effect, a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added.<ref name="StudDail"/> In the same sequence, John McClane drives a car into a hovering helicopter, which crashes to the ground. This was accomplished by first filming one take where an assassin with a rifle jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades.<ref name="StudDail"/> The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.<ref name="CGSociety"/>

The Orphanage developed a multi-level freeway interchange for use in one of the final scenes of the film by creating a digital environment and a 1,000-foot long spiral ramp that was built in front of a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]].<ref name="VFXWorld1">{{cite news|last=Bielik|first=Alain|title=''Live Free or Die Hard'': A VFX Race Against Time|url=http://vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=1e242f07&atype=articles&id=3335|publisher=[http://vfxworld.com/ VFXWorld.com]|date=[[July 2]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref> When a [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35 jet]] is chasing McClane on the freeway, a miniature  model and a full-size prop were both built to assist in digitally adding the jet into the scene.<ref name="VFXWorld1"/><ref name="AmericCinema">{{Citation|last=Gray|first=Simon|title=One-Man Riot Squad|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=Volume 88|issue=Issue 7|pages=p. 32.|date=July 2007|year=2007}}</ref> The nine-foot model was constructed from November 2006 through February 2007.<ref name="VFXWorld1"/> When the jet is shown hovering near the freeway, editors used the software 3D graphics program [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to blur the background and create a heat ripple effect.<ref name="VFXWorld1"/>

==Rating==
The past three installments in the ''Die Hard'' series have all been rated R by the [[MPAA]]. ''Live Free or Die Hard'', however,  sparked controversy because it was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying "It was about three months into it [production], and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13...But in the end, it was just trying to make the best ''Die Hard'' movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be."<ref name="DVDComm"/> Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, <U+201C>I really wanted this one to live up to the promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one.<U+201D> to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they<U+2019>re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film.<U+201D><ref name="Smashmouth">{{cite news | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/05/02/live-free-or-die-hard-to-be-cut-for-pg-13-rating/ | title = Live Free or Die Hard to be cut for a PG-13 Rating?! | date=[[May 2]] [[2007]] |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |publisher=[http://www.slashfilm.com SlashFilm.com] |accessdate =2007-11-13}}</ref>
Willis later confirmed that it was PG-13, but thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect it in watching it, due to the level and intensity of the action, and the usage of some amount of profanity, albeit less than the previous films.<ref name="Confirmed">{{cite web | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/05/07/confirmed-live-free-or-die-hard-is-rated-pg-13/ |first=Peter|last=Sciretta|publisher=[http://www.slashfilm.com/ SlashFilm.com] | date=[[May 7]] [[2007]]| title = Confirmed: Live Free or Die Hard is Rated PG-13 | accessdate =2007-11-13}}</ref>  He even claimed that this film was the best of the four by saying "It<U+2019>s unbelievable.
