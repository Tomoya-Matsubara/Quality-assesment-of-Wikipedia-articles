'''M-88''' is a [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. It runs between [[U.S. Route 31 (Michigan)|US Highway 31]] (US&nbsp;31) and [[U.S. Route 131|US&nbsp;131]]/[[M-66 (Michigan highway)|M-66]] in the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]]. Running from [[Mancelona, Michigan|Mancelona]] to [[Eastport, Michigan|Eastport]], M-88 also goes through the communities of [[Bellaire, Michigan|Bellaire]] and [[Central Lake, Michigan|Central Lake]]. The highway is completely within [[Antrim County, Michigan|Antrim County]] and is known by the street name of "Scenic Highway" outside of the various communities along its routing.

M-88 is an original trunkline dating back to the 1919 signing of the state system. An extension in the 1920s and paving in the late 1930s created the highway as it exists today. The highway was not listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], nor is it included in the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]].

==Route description==

M-88 starts in the community of Eastport at an intersection four blocks east of the [[Grand Traverse Bay]] of [[Lake Michigan]] next to Barnes County Park. From its start, it runs east along the northern end of [[Torch Lake]]. M-88 zig-zags south and east along Scenic Highway to the community of Central Lake. In Central Lake it runs south along Main Street, following the western shore of [[Intermediate Lake]].<ref name="google">{{cite map |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=US-31+%26+M-88,+MI&geocode=&dirflg=&daddr=US-131+%26+M-88,+Mancelona,+MI&f=d&sll=45.107107,-85.35271&sspn=0.009632,0.014505&ie=UTF8&z=11 |title=US-31 & M-88 to US-131 & M-88, Mancelona, MI 49659 |publisher=[[Google Maps]] |cartography=NAVTEQ |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref><ref name="MDOT07">{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Department of Transportation Map |year=2007 |scale=1in.:15mi./1cm.:9km. |section= F9<U+2013>G10 }}</ref> South of Intermediate Lake, M-88 crosses the [[Intermediate River]] on a [[National Register of Historic Places|historic designation]]-eligible [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era bridge along Bridge Street in Bellaire.<ref name="MDOTHB">{{cite web |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title=M-88/Intermediate River |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11154_11188-25608--,00.html |date=May 9, 2002 |accessyear=2008 |accessmonthday=March 13 }}</ref> This section of M-88 is just west of the [[Antrim County Airport]] before the highway turns east on Cayuga Street in downtown and south on Division Street.<ref name="google"/> The Bellaire section of the trunkline is the location of the highest traffic levels along the highway.

South of Bellaire, M-88 passes the Chief Golf Course and the Legend, Summit and Bellaire golf clubs. M-88 crosses the Shanty Creek, which is the namesake of a resort in the area. South of the Bellaire Golf Club, M-88 turns eastward again, passing south of Schuss Mountain, another resort. This section of trunkline is used by 3,300&nbsp;vehicles in the 2007 AADT survey.<ref name="aadtMI"/> Past Schuss Mountain, M-88 turns east at Alden highway and enters the community of Mancelona, passing the Fairview Cemetery. The highway runs along on State Street into downtown. M-88 ends at an intersection with US&nbsp;131/M-66 running along Williams Street, and State Street continues eastward as [[C-38 (Michigan county highway)|C-38]].<ref name="google"/><ref name="MDOT07"/>
