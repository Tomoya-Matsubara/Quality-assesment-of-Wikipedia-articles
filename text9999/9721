The '''Nuclear Information and Resource Service''' ('''NIRS''') is an [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] group founded in 1978 to be the information and networking center for citizens and organizations concerned about [[nuclear power]], [[radioactive waste]], [[radiation]] and [[sustainable energy]] issues.  The organization advocates the implementation of safe, sustainable solutions such as [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[solar power]], [[wind power]] and [[plug-in hybrid]]s.

As of 2007, NIRS claims to initiate "''large-scale organizing and public education campaigns on specific issues,''"<ref name=ni>[http://www.nirs.org/about/nirs.htm About NIRS]</ref> such as to "''bring technical expertise and strategic sense to grassroots environmental groups.''"

In 2000, NIRS' affiliation with [[World Information Service on Energy]] (WISE) turned it into an international organization (NIRS/WISE).<ref name=ni />

The magazine ''[[Nuclear Engineering International]]'' has said that it runs easily the best website on uranium mining throughout the world.<ref>''Nuclear Engineering International''.

==Issue stances==
Some of the policies endorsed by NIRS include strict controls on nuclear waste disposal, bans on nuclear weapons and new power plants. NIRS is opposed to ineffective nuclear waste reprocessing, unsafe transportation of nuclear waste, and the implementation of large-scale nuclear dumps like [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]]. NIRS also does not view nuclear energy as a remedy for [[climate change]].

==International Offices==
NIRS and WISE have merged their operations and WISE has relay offices in Amsterdam, Argentina, Austria, the Czech Republic, India, Japan, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, and the Ukraine<ref>[http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/]</ref>.  The bi-weekly WISE News Communique merged with the NIRS Nuclear Monitor and covers the resistance movements working against nuclear power world wide as well as chronicling the failings of the industry.  Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian versions of this newsletter are also printed.

==Press==
On 15 May 2007, NIRS issued a report claiming that radioactive scrap, concrete, equipment, asphalt, plastic, wood, chemicals, and soil from U.S. nuclear weapons facilities are being released to regular landfills and could get into commercial recycling streams."<ref name=ens>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2007/2007-05-14-08.asp U.S. Allows Radioactive Materials in Ordinary Landfills]</ref>

On 3 August 2004, NIRS issued a report stating that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission may allow the illegal practice of manually shutting down nuclear power plants in the event of fire.<ref name=ens2>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2004/2004-08-03-02.asp Manual Shutdown of U.S. Reactors on Fire May Be Allowed]</ref>

On 17 July 2007, regarding the leakage of water from the spent fuel pool of the [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]] after the [[2007 Niigata earthquake]], [[Michael Mariotte]], spoke on behalf of the NIRS and commented "The leak itself doesn't sound significant as of yet, but the fact that it went unreported is a concern, when a company begins by denying a problem, it makes you wonder if there's another shoe to drop."<ref name=CBS>[http://www.ktvu.com/earthquakes/13689063/detail.html Japan Quake Kills At Least 9; Nuclear Plant Damaged]</ref>

In October 2010, Michael Mariotte, executive director of NIRS, predicted that the U.S. nuclear industry will not experience a [[nuclear renaissance]], for the simple reason that <U+201C>nuclear reactors make no economic sense<U+201D>. The economic slump has driven down electricity demand and the price of competing energy sources, and Congress has failed of to pass climate change legislation, making nuclear economics very difficult.<ref>Matthew L.
