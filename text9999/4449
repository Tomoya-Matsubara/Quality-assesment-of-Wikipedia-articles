'''''El barberillo de Lavapi<U+00E9>s''''' is a [[zarzuela]] in three acts (Op.56) by [[Francisco Asenjo Barbieri]]. The [[libretto]], in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is by [[Luis Mariano de Larra]]. The first performance took place at the [[Teatro de la Zarzuela]] in [[Madrid]] on 18 December 1874, and it became one of the most well-known zarzuelas.<ref name="Grove">Salter, Lionel. El barberillo de Lavapi<U+00E9>s. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.</ref> Translated as ''The Little Barber of Lavapi<U+00E9>s'', the title refers to the occupation of one of the main characters and the humble and neglected area of the Spanish capital called [[Lavapi<U+00E9>s]] where it is set.

==Background==

Barbieri had already found success in the zarzuela genre with the pieces ''Jugar con fuego'' ''(Play with fire)'' in 1851 and ''Pan y toros'' ''(Bread and bulls)'' in 1864<ref name="Traubner">[[Richard Traubner|Traubner, Richard]]. ''Operetta <U+2014> a theatrical history.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1983, p430-431.</ref> and would eventually compose around 70 zarzuelas. Numbers in ''El barberillo de Lavapi<U+00E9>s'' such as the song for Paloma "Como nac<U+00ED> en la calle de la Paloma", Lamparilla's patter songs as well as the [[Jota (music)|jota]] and [[Seguidilla|seguidilla]] became familiar in Spanish musical culture.<ref name="Grove"/> De Larra's libretto is considered to be successful and well-constructed, echoing [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Scribe|Scribe]] in some respects.<ref name="Kaminski">'Francisco Asenjo Barbieri: El Barberillo de Lavapies'. In: Kaminski, Piotr. ''Mille et Un Op<U+00E9>ras''. Fayard, 2003, p54-55.</ref>

The work was particularly admired by [[Manuel de Falla]], who described ''Pan y toros'' and ''El barberillo de Lavapi<U+00E9>s'' as Barbieri's most outstanding theatrical works "which reflect the rhythmic-melodic character of Spanish song and dance at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth", and which "undoubtedly exerted an influence on Spanish composers, shaping certain unmistakable features we find in our music from about the middle of the last century until [[Isaac Alb<U+00E9>niz|Alb<U+00E9>niz]] and [[Enrique Granados|Granados]]".<ref>De Falla, Manuel. ''Manuel de Falla - On Music and Musicians'', with introduction and notes by Federico Sope<U+00F1>a, translated by David Urman and J M Thomson. Marion Boyars, London, Boston, 1950, 1979, p63.</ref> In his book on operetta Traubner claims that the score is the greatest 19th century zarzuela, possessing a "joyous" score with no dull moments, and while with a Spanish accent, echoes of [[op<U+00E9>ra comique]] or [[opera buffa]].<ref name="Traubner"/>

==Synopsis==
The action takes place in Madrid, 1766 and based partly on history.<ref name="Grove"/>

===Act 1===

In El Pardo park, Lavapi<U+00E9>s there are festive crowds of peddlars, young lovers and students bustle around. The dentist-barber Lamparilla enters and sings of his career before aiming his comments at the government. Paloma comes on next, singing; although Lamparilla loves her, she just flirts back at him. Next the Marquesita enters incognito for a secret meeting with Don Juan de Peralta, a fellow conspirator in a plot of the Infanta to get rid of the unpopular prime minister [[Jer<U+00F3>nimo Grimaldi, 1st Duke of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] and replace him with [[Jos<U+00E9> Mo<U+00F1>ino, 1st Count of Floridablanca|Floridablanca]]. Before they can retire for discussions, Don Luis, the nephew of Grimaldi and her fianc<U+00E9> arrives. He notices the Marquesita with Juan, he fetches guards to challenge him, and a duel seems likely. 

La Marquesita asks her seamstress La Paloma what to do to help save Juan, setting out the position. Lamparilla joins them and they agree to dress in festive garb as a distant cousin to effect her escape. When the police arrive they encounter a folktale students, allowing Lamparilla to enter the house and help Juan. 

When Luis returns Lamparilla leads a veiled woman away into a neighouring house. When the police come to the inn, Lamparilla at first diverts attention, but when Luis tells Don Pedro, the guards' commander of the consipracy, a sedan chair is carried on to take the prisoner but when it leaves it is Lamparilla who peeks out between the curtains.

===Act 2===

In the Plaza de Lavapi<U+00E9>s, the local gossip about the disappearance of Lamparilla while guards keep watch. The barber suddenly appears, claiming that he was only held for smashing up street lamps.
Paloma meets La Marquesita and thanks her for the money which was used to bribe the jailer, and the Marquestia tries to get Lamparilla to be part of the plot against Grimaldi. She asks Lamparilla to get some to destroy the street lamps and divert the guards' attention.
Don Luis arrives to talk of love to the Marquesita, while suspecting her of being unfaithful, but she refuses to see him for four days, then joins the conspirators next door. Luis comes back in disguise, with the other plotters.
Paloma and Lamparilla are alone when they notice masked men going into La Marquesita's house. Don Luis and Don Pedro arrive to prepare to snatch them. 
When the troublemakers enter to smash the lamps, Lamparilla begins to sing a seguidille to distract the guards. 
As the guards prepare to grab the plotters, Paloma warns La Marquesita who is just able to escape through adjoining shops with the co-conspirators. 
The acts closes in confusion as the guards cannot decide whether to chase the plotters or arrest the troublemakers.

===Act 3===

In Paloma's attic workshop the seamstresses sing while they work. Since the conspiracy was uncovered Paloma has not been able to see La Marquesita. She secretly hatches her plan to allow Marquesita and Don Luis to flee in disguise from Madrid. Lamparilla has made the final preparations, and brings in Don Luis in his finery; they all anticipate the journey out to the country.

Just in time the four hide in Paloma's chamber as Don Pedro and his guards burst in. But Paloma and the noble couple are soon caught. However, enter and catch them all. Lamparilla had fled across the rooftops and he rushes in to announce that Grimaldi has been removed and Floridablanca replaced him as prime minister. 
As a nephew of Grimaldi, Don Luis is forced to go into exile but La Marquesita decides to join him, while Lamparilla and Paloma pledge their mutual love, and all ends in joy and happiness.
