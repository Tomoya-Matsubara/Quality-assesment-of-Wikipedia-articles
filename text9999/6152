'''Steve "Pablo" Davis''' born Paul Meier Klienbordt, 1916 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States|US]].  Davis is an American artist, life-long [[communist]] activist and [[Detroit]] [[community organizer]].

==Early life==
Davis was raised by his Jewish immigrant parents in Philadelphia. He worked as a coal miner at age 14 until he became involved in a violent strike. After this strike he left Pennsylvania to ride the rails as a young [[hobo]].  Responding to an ad in the newspaper, his travels eventually took him to Detroit, [[Michigan]] where, at age 16, he meet the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[muralist]] Diego Rivera and Rivera's wife [[Frida Kahlo]].<ref>[http://www.modeldmedia.com/features/davis73.aspx  Biography in Model D-troiter]</ref> By this time Davis had become a militant communist. He served in the American volunteer [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>

Davis has stated that he changed his name from Paul Klienbordt in the 1950s after doing prison time for activities related to migrant labor organizing in [[Colorado]], although this cannot be independently verified.<ref>[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7125.

Pablo Davis, born Paul Kleinbord to Joseph and Rose Kleinbord in Philadelphia, PA lived with his family in Philadelphia until at least the age of 18.  He is not listed in the archives for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

Born Paul Kleinbord, he attended high school in Philadelphia. After graduation he went on to attend art school for a period of time. This was also in Philadelphia. He married and his wife gave birth to a son. During the 1930's and early 1940's he was living in Philadelphia and didn't leave for any significant period of time. About 1945 he was sent to a sanatorium in Denver, CO because he had contracted tuberculosis. He remained in Denver until the early 1950's which is when he arrived in Detroit with his second wife.
He lived in Ann Arbor for a period of time, then moved to Detroit where he has lived since.-

==Artistic career==
[[Image:Rivera detroit industry south.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''Detroit Industry, South Wall'', 1932-33. [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] Davis is the last surviving artist who worked on this project.]]

Davis's work ranges from representational [[post-impressionism]] to highly abstract [[expressionism]]. Much of Davis's art is influenced by the [[cubism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]], who he has claimed to have studied under and worked with in Europe.  His other major influence is Diego Rivera and the other Mexican muralists. Davis assisted Diego Rivera on the ''Detroit Industry'' mural panels in Rivera Court in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Davis says that he painted a "[[Dick Tracey]]" like face on one of the figures when Rivera asked for a tough looking figure.<ref>[http://detnews.com/2004/project/0405/04/c06-138021.htm Detroit News Article on Davis's role in ''Detroit Industry'']</ref> He also assisted Rivera on a mural painted inside the Ford Motor Company's [[River Rouge Plant|Rouge Plant]], in [[Dearborn]], Michigan.<ref>[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7125 Metro Times article, Supra.]</ref> One of Davis's paintings is displayed in the [[Louvre]]. Davis's painting of Michigan Governor [[John Swainson]] is hung in rotunda of the Michigan Capitol Building. He has painted commissioned portraits of celebrities including [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. 
Davis is also known for his community mural projects in which he works with young people to produce large scale co-operatively produced paintings.  At least two of these murals can be found in Southwest Detroit.<ref>[http://www.southwestdetroit.com/Home%20Items/Cool%20Cities/Cool%20Cities%20ethnic&culture.PDF Examples of Davis's community murals]</ref>

Davis has been a long time member of Detroit's [[Scarab Club]] a gallery and social venue for leading Detroit artists. His autograph is founds on the club's ceiling beam along with the autographs of Diego Rivera, [[Norman Rockwell]] and [[John Sloan]]. Signing the ceiling beams is a Scarab Club tradition honoring distinguished guests and members.<ref>[http://www.scarabclub.org/history.html History of Scarab Club]</ref>

==Community activism==
Davis resides in Southwest Detroit, the heart of the city's [[barrio]] and the home to many enclave neighborhood of great cultural and ethnic diversity.  Since the 1980s Davis has been active in an ecumenical project seeking to unite this community around the development of senior housing and services for children, first through the community based group Ecumenical Project SAVE and later Bridging Communities Inc. This activism has resulted in an 80 unit senior affordable housing project known as the "Pablo Davis Senior Center."   This project also incorporates intergenerational programs to enhance services for both seniors and children. Davis, who has donated much of his portfolio and collection to this project, resides and maintains a studio in this complex. Although still an avowed communist and revolutionary, Davis asserts he is comfortable working with this mostly religious and [[Christian]] group.<ref>[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=4086  Metro Times article on Davis's role in Bridging Communities project]</ref><ref>[http://www.uaw.org/solidarity/00/0500/feature02.html.
