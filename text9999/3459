'''Vincent Lamar "Vince" Carter''' (born January 26, 1977) is an American professional [[basketball]] player with the [[Dallas Mavericks]]. He is a [[shooting guard]] who can also play [[small forward]].

A high school [[McDonald's All-American]], Carter played three years at the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. While there, he twice reached the Final Four of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] before being selected as the fifth overall pick in the [[1998 NBA Draft]] by the [[Golden State Warriors]], who traded him to the [[Toronto Raptors]]. He won the 1999 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] and won the [[Slam Dunk Contest]] at the 2000 [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] the following season. That summer, he represented the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]] in the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]], winning a gold medal.

He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his leaping ability and slam dunks,<ref>{{cite web|author=&#160;United States |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/vince-carter |title=Vince Carter: Biography from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> earning him  nicknames such as "Vinsanity," "Air Canada," and "Half-Man, Half-Amazing." 

He led the Raptors to their first three playoff appearances. In 2004, he was traded to the [[New Jersey Nets]], and he helped lead them to three playoff berths. In July 2009, Carter was traded to the [[Orlando Magic]], helping them to advance to the Eastern Conference finals before being traded to the Phoenix Suns in December, 2010.

An eight-time NBA All-Star, Carter joined NBA players [[Julius Erving]] and [[Michael Jordan]] as the only players to lead the [[NBA All-Star Game]] fan voting three or more times.<ref>{{cite news

Off the court, Carter established his Embassy of Hope Foundation, assisting children and their families in Florida, New Jersey and Toronto. He was recognized in 2000 as Child Advocate of the Year by the Children's Home Society, and received the Florida Governor's Points of Light award in 2007 for his philanthropy in his home state.

==High school and college==
Born in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], Carter was a 1995 [[McDonald's All-American]] at [[Mainland High School]] in Daytona Beach, leading Mainland to its first Class 6A state title in 56 years<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcdonaldsallamerican.com/2007_boys_alumni.pdf |title=McDonald's All American Alumni |publisher=[[McDonald's]] |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-04-18 }}</ref> before spending three seasons playing [[college basketball]] at [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] under [[Dean Smith]] and later, [[Bill Guthridge]]. During the 1997<U+2013>1998 season, he was a member of new coach Guthridge's "six starters" system that featured [[Antawn Jamison]], [[Shammond Williams]], [[Ed Cota]], [[Ademola Okulaja]], and [[Makhtar N'Diaye (basketball player)|Makhtar N'Diaye]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mpQZSJAq2fcC&pg=PA292&lpg=PA292|title=Blue Blood: Duke-Carolina: Inside the Most Storied Rivalry in College Hoops|first=Art|last=Chansky|coauthors=[[Dick Vitale]]|year=2006 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn= 0-312-32788-9 |page= |pages=292<U+2013>294|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> During his sophomore and junior seasons, Carter helped North Carolina to consecutive [[ACC Men's Basketball Tournament]] titles and [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]] appearances. He finished the 1997<U+2013>98 season with a 15.6 points per game average and was named second-team All-American. In May 1998, Carter declared for the [[1998 NBA Draft]], following his classmate Jamison, who had declared earlier that spring.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/01/sports/sp-45225|title=Carter Follows Jamison in Declaring for the NBA|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 1, 1998|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

On January 31, 2012, Carter was honored as one of the 35 greatest [[McDonald's All-American]]s,<ref>{{cite web|last=Caplan |first=Jeff |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/mavericks/post/_/id/4684390/vince-carter-jason-kidd-honored-as-all-timers |title=Vince Carter, Jason Kidd honored as all-timers <U+2013> Dallas Mavericks Blog <U+2013> ESPN Dallas |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2010-01-02 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/wilkins-honored-one-35-greatest-mcdonalds-all-americans |title=Wilkins Honored as One of 35 Greatest McDonald's All Americans |publisher=NBA|date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref> and on February 23, 2012, President Obama, an avid NCAA and NBA basketball fan, gave praise to Carter at a fundraiser event, referring to Carter's game as a "huge treat for me ever since he<U+2019>s been playing for the Tar Heels."<ref>{{cite web|last=Caplan |first=Jeff |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/mavericks/post/_/id/4685553/vince-carter-hosts-president-obama-fundraiser |title=Vince Carter to host Obama fundraiser <U+2013> Dallas Mavericks Blog <U+2013> ESPN Dallas |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2010-01-02 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/obama-dnc-chair-raise-21m-nba-stars-mansion/392781 |title=Obama, DNC chair raise $2.1M at NBA star's mansion &#124; WashingtonExaminer.com |publisher=Campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

==NBA career==
===Toronto Raptors (1998<U+2013>2004)===
[[File:Lipofsky Vince Carter.jpg|thumb|Carter as a Raptor.]]
The Raptors struggled in their early years as did their expansion cousins, the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]].  After the acquisition of Carter through a [[1998 NBA Draft|draft day trade in 1998]] however, the team set league attendance records in 2000, 2001, and 2002 and the value of the Raptors franchise doubled during Carter's tenure as Raptor.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/32/biz_06nba_Toronto-Raptors_321933.html | work=Forbes | title=#17 Toronto Raptors | date=2007-01-25}}</ref> Carter was instrumental in leading the Raptors to the playoffs in 2000 for the first time in franchise history. He also led them to a franchise high of 47 wins and their first ever playoff series win in 2001, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. 

Carter was initially drafted by the NBA's [[Golden State Warriors]] with the fifth overall pick, and then traded to the [[Toronto Raptors]] for the fourth overall pick, [[Antawn Jamison]], his college teammate and good friend.<ref name="about">{{cite web |url=http://probasketball.about.com/od/nbaplayerprofiles/a/vincecarter.htm |title=Vince Carter Player Profile |last=Velasco |first=Dennis |publisher=About Basketball |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> Carter's rookie season was the shortened 50-game 1999 season, after the NBA locked out its players in [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA season|1998<U+2013>99]]. Carter started almost every game for coach [[Butch Carter]], averaged 18.3 [[points per game]] (ppg), and eventually won the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref name="roty">{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/awards_rookieofyear.html |title=Rookie of the Year |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> The [[1999<U+2013>2000 NBA season|next year]], Carter was selected to an All-Star Team for the first time, averaged 25.7 ppg, made the Third Team All-NBA, and showcased his athleticism and dunking abilities in the 2000 [[NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest|NBA Slam Dunk Contest]]. He won the contest by performing an array of dunks including a 360<U+00B0> windmill, a between the legs bounce dunk, and an "elbow in the rim" dunk (also known as a "cookie jar" dunk or the "honey dip").<ref name="about" /> [[ESPN]] referred to the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest as, "one of the most memorable contests in the entire run." [[Kobe Bryant]], who was invited along with Carter, Michael Jordan, [[Dominique Wilkins]], and Julius Erving as judges for the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, said that among the judges in their prime, Carter would win in a dunk contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/topics/_/page/sprite-slam-dunk-contest |title=Slam Dunk Contest <U+2013> NBA Topics <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

In Carter's first two seasons, he and his distant cousin [[Tracy McGrady]] formed a formidable one-two punch as Raptor teammates. The two led the Raptors to their first playoff berth in the [[2000 NBA Playoffs]], but they were swept in the first round by the [[New York Knicks]], in three games. Upon McGrady's departure to the [[Orlando Magic]] as a free agent in a sign and trade deal, Carter became the Raptors' franchise player. Kobe Bryant, whose team won several championships in the decade to follow, believed they could've competed for several championships if they had stayed together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/media/slam-tv/2011/11/video-tracy-mcgrady-vince-carter-charles-oakley-raptors-look-back/ |title=Video: T-Mac, Vince and Oakley Look Back |publisher=Slam Online |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> 

In [[2000<U+2013>01 NBA season|2000<U+2013>01]], his third season, Carter averaged a career-high 27.6 ppg, made the Second Team All-NBA, and was voted in as a starter in the [[2001 NBA All-Star Game]], while the Raptors finished the regular season with a franchise-record 47 wins. In the playoffs, the Raptors beat the [[New York Knicks]] 3<U+2013>2 in the first round, and advanced to the [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001 Eastern Conference Semifinals]] to face off against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. Carter and [[Allen Iverson]] played in a seven-game series that see-sawed back and forth. Carter scored 50 points on Philly in game three and set a NBA playoff record for most three-point field goals made in one game. On the morning of Game Seven, Carter attended his graduation at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. He had completed the requirements for his degree in African-American Studies the previous summer and said he felt receiving his diploma was personally significant.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/05/20/carter010520.html |title=Carter gets his diploma |date=2001-05-20 |publisher=cbc.ca |accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> Television ratings for game seven soared as one of the highest watched in NBC's history for a non-finals game.

In July 2011, Iverson reflected back on the series. <U+201C>It was incredible. (Carter) had great games at home and I had some great games at home, but both of us were just trying to put our teams on our back and win basketball games. It is great just having those memories and being a part of something like that.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csnphilly.com/07/18/11/bLynamb-Iverson-still-an-icon-in-twiligh/landing_insider_lynam.html?blockID=542017&feedID=704 |title=Lynam: Iverson still an icon in twilight of career |publisher=Csnphilly.com |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

In the summer of 2001, Carter signed a $94 million, six-year extension with the Raptors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/features/2001/si_preview/raptors/ |title=SI's 2001<U+2013>02 NBA Preview: Toronto Raptors |date=2001-10-29 |publisher=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> In addition, Carter announced that he would be hosting a charity basketball game featuring fellow NBA stars that would be played at the [[Air Canada Centre]] in Toronto on August 3, 2001. The success of the first game being sold out encouraged Carter to make the charity game an annual summer event.

The [[2001<U+2013>02 NBA season|next season]] was an injury-riddled one for Carter. He started in 60 games and he averaged 24.7 ppg. He was voted into the [[2002 NBA All-Star Game]], but he could not participate due to injury. The Raptors did not fare well without their All-Star player. The team lost 17 of 18 games to drop to 30<U+2013>38, then won 12 of their last 14 to finish at 42<U+2013>40. Carter was injured during the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]], and his team was defeated in the first round by the [[Detroit Pistons]], in five games. During the [[2003 NBA All-Star Game]], Carter gave up his starting All-Star spot to the [[Washington Wizards]]' [[Michael Jordan]] to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All-Star.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Basketball/NBA/Toronto/2004/12/18/788808-sun.html |title=Vince's wild ride |last=Zeisberger |first=Mike |date=2004-12-18 |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> During his Raptors tenure, news came out that Carter had developed [[Patellar tendinitis|Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease]] also known as "[[jumper's knee]]," which drew criticism and questions from local media outlets and fans about Carter's long term durability as a NBA scorer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/carter/#9 | work=CBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/11/08/carter021108.html |title=Vince Carter out four weeks |date=2007-11-22 |publisher=cbc.ca |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref>

Fifty games into the [[2003<U+2013>04 NBA season|2003<U+2013>04]] season, Toronto was 25<U+2013>25 and in a position to make the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], but injuries to [[Jalen Rose]], [[Alvin Williams]], and Carter sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings, and the Raptors fell three games short of making the playoffs. Carter's individual season performance was 22.5 [[points per game|ppg]], but teammate Alvin Williams' knee injury turned out to be career ending.

===Trade to the Nets===
In the 2004 off-season, G.M. [[Glen Grunwald]] and the entire coaching staff were fired after falling three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the previous season. Carter became frustrated with the Raptors' upper management. In particular, Carter was unhappy with [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]] (MLSE) and Raptors president [[Richard Peddie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raptorsdigest.com/dont-blame-vince-blame-mlse/ |title=Blog Archive <U+00BB> Don<U+2019>t Blame Vince, Blame MLSE |publisher=Raptors Digest |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref name="realgm2001">{{cite web |url=http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/170029/Vince_Carter_wants_Raptors_President_Peddie_Fired |title=Carter wants Peddie fired |date=2001-10-29 |publisher=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref><ref name="torontosun1">{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/basketball/2010/07/26/14836426.html/ |title=Bryan bashes Bosh |date=2010-07-26 |publisher=Toronto Sun |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=02:31 AM |url=http://www.tribemagazine.com/board/sports/71980-article-sportsnet-real-deal-vince.html |title=article on sportsnet <U+2013> Real Deal with Vince <U+2013> TRIBE <U+2013> tribe.ca |publisher=Tribemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> In a private meeting, Peddie reassured Carter that MLSE was serious in building a contender in Toronto and that he would pursue established players like point guard [[Steve Nash]] and centre [[Jamaal Magloire]]. Carter was also given the impression that Peddie would consider [[Julius Erving]] as a serious candidate for G.M., thinking he could attract star players to Toronto. Though Julius Erving flew into Toronto for an interview, interim G.M. [[Jack McCloskey]] publicly disclosed a week prior that Erving was not really in the mix.<ref name="realgm2001"/><ref name="torontosun1"/> Peddie instead hired [[Rob Babcock]] whose first priority in rebuilding the Raptors said was to "establish our philosophy," stating "we are not really worried about how many wins we get right away, or whether we make the playoffs within the first year or two."<ref>{{cite web|author=4:05 p.m. ET |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5157990/from/RL/ |title=Raptors hire ex-Wolf Babcock as GM <U+2013> NBA- NBC Sports |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=2004-06-07 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> After hiring Sam Mitchell as new head coach,<ref>http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=20040630&id=BCkqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OUgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6776,3439780</ref> Babcock's first move was to select [[Rafael Ara<U+00FA>jo (basketball)|Rafael Araujo]] with the eighth overall pick in the [[2004 NBA Draft]] to fill in the centre position. He later signed guard [[Rafer Alston]] to a five-year deal.

Consequently, much speculation arose whether Carter wanted to be traded. The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' reported that Carter felt misled and felt the Raptors would never be an elite team under the current MLSE structure with Peddie as Raptors president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Basketball/NBA/Toronto/2004/06/24/512581.html |title=SLAM!

In his first game back in Toronto, on April 15, 2005, Carter was heavily booed and jeered by Raptors fans; some fans were found burning Vince Carter jerseys, while many donned No. 15 baby bibs, 'FUVC' t-shirts, and other merchandise that labelled Carter as "Wince" or as "immature," alluding to Carter's knee and ankle injuries and his dissent.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/pointofview/2011/02/chris-bosh-returns-how-do-you-see-the-former-toronto-raptors-legacy.html | work=CBC News}}</ref> Much like former Raptors teammate Tracy McGrady, Carter has been booed each time he has returned to Toronto.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/basketball/2008/12/16/7763661-sun.html|title=Carter thrives on being villain|first=Frank|last=Zicarelli|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=December 16, 2008}}</ref> In early January 2005, when asked by [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]] if he always pushed himself as hard as he should, Carter replied, "In years past, no.

In November 2011, nearly seven years since the trade to the Nets, Carter, along with his cousin Tracy McGrady and [[Charles Oakley]] addressed the Toronto audience in an interview on ''[[Off the Record with Michael Landsberg]]''. When asked about being booed in Toronto, Carter said, "They watched myself and Tracy grow up. And when we left they still got to see (us) flourish and become (who we are). For me, I looked at it as, a young child growing up into a grown man and moving on. And I get it. Leaving, hurt a lot of people. It hurt me because I tell you what... I accomplished a lot, I learned a lot, I became the person and player of who I am today because of that experience, through the coaches, players, and everything else. I get it... but regardless I still love the city. I have friends there and my heart is still there because that's where it all started." Later in the interview, when asked about any words to the Toronto fans, Carter said, "I appreciate the fans and whether you cheer for me, boo me, or hate me, I still love you. Toronto's one of the best kept secrets.. puts one of the best products on the floor and one of the top places to play in."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0L-JkFV4gY&list=UUW5kkJrsh3IDMTrEnzV1lnQ&feature=plcp |title=Vince Carter Interview on OTR <U+2022> November 2011 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tsn.ca/nba/story/?id=379584 |title=McGrady, Carter and Oakley look back on time with Raptors |publisher=.tsn.ca |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tsn.ca/nba/story/?id=379584# |title=McGrady, Carter and Oakley look back on time with Raptors |publisher=.tsn.ca |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref>[http://watch.tsn.ca/off-the-record/clip563812#clip563812 ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

On November 6, 2012, in an interview with TSN Radio 1050, Carter reiterated his love for the city and his appreciation for the Toronto Raptors organization.<ref>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/2012/11/06/vince_carter_sam_mitchell_dallas_mavericks_toronto_raptors/</ref><ref>.http://www.tsn.ca/toronto/story/?id=408989</ref><ref>http://www.tsn.ca/nba/story/?id=409016</ref> The next day, [[Sam Mitchell]] and [[Rob Babcock]] revealed on Sportsnet 590 The Fan that the night before Carter was traded to New Jersey, Carter phoned Mitchell to express his desire to stay in Toronto and commit to their vision for the team. However, Babcock said it was too late and the trade had already been verbally agreed upon. Looking back on it Mitchell feels he should have personally contacted the owner, Larry Tannenbaum, but was reluctant because he did not want to break the chain of command.<ref>http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/2012/11/07/sam_mitchell_vince_carter_toronto_raptors/</ref><ref>{{http://www.raptorshq.com/2012/11/8/3617942/vince-carter-and-the-toronto-raptors-together-forever</ref>

===New Jersey Nets (2004<U+2013>2009)===
As a Net, Carter produced some of his highest numbers. He scored more than 23.5 ppg and attained career high averages in rebounds per game (5.8) and assists per game (4.7) while missing just 11 games in his four full seasons as a Net. Carter helped lead the New Jersey Nets to three playoff runs and is currently in the top 10 of nineteen different all-time Nets statistical categories, including points, points per game (1st all-time of NBA Nets), defensive rebounds, assists, turnover rate, 3-point field goals, offensive rating, player efficiency rating, and win shares.

[[File:Vinsanity.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carter during his tenure with the Nets.]]

The [[2004<U+2013>05 NBA season|2004<U+2013>05 season]] looked gloomy at first for the Nets. Their star Kidd was recovering from his own microfracture surgery and the team got off to a 2<U+2013>11 start, and even with Jason Kidd returning from injury, the outlook was bleak with Jefferson requiring season ending surgery. However, after the trade, Carter rallied the Nets from  more than 10 games out of the playoffs to gain the final seed in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]].

In the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season]], the Carter-Kidd duo co-lead the Nets to 49 wins, an Atlantic Division title, and the number three seed in the playoffs, while averaging 24.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game. He led the Nets to the second round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual NBA champions Miami Heat in five games. Carter averaged 29.6 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 11 playoff games. Carter was also named to the All-Star Team in 2006.

In the [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season]] Carter was named, along with teammate [[Jason Kidd]], as a reserve to the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game]], after losing out on a starting spot to [[Gilbert Arenas]] by 3,010 votes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2007/news/story?id=2743007 |title=Arenas edges Carter for starting nod; LeBron is top pick |date=2007-02-17 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> Both Carter and Kidd made their eighth All-Star game appearance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/nets/news/All_Access_Online_Kidd_Carter_All_Star.html |title=Jason Kidd and Vince Carter named to 2007 Eastern Conference All-Star Team |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref>

In a 120<U+2013>114 overtime win over the [[Washington Wizards]], April 7, 2007, Carter and [[Jason Kidd]] became the first teammates in over 18 years to record [[triple-double]]s in the same game since the [[Chicago Bulls]]' [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]] achieved this feat against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in 1989. Carter finished with 46 points, a career-high 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. Kidd finished with 10 points, tied a career-high with 16 rebounds, and tied a season-high with 18 assists. Carter's triple double is the second highest total for a triple double, second only to [[Alvan Adams]] of the [[Phoenix Suns]] who tallied 47 points and 18 rebounds and 12 assists over 30 years ago.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270407017 |title=Kidd, Carter match feat not done since Jordan, Pippen in 1989 |date=2007-04-07 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref>

After the Nets eliminated the Raptors, the Nets were eliminated from the playoffs by Lebron James and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] (lost series 4<U+2013>2).  During the season, the [[New York Knicks]] and Nets had discussed a trade in February around Carter, which was ended with the trading deadline. [[Shaquille O'Neal]] when asked which player he would want to play after playing with Kobe and Wade replied, "I'm gonna have to go with Vince Carter. I think he needs a player like me that can get him to the next level. And I can get him to the next level." Barkley responded by accusing O'Neil of [[tampering (sport)|tampering]]. In the off-season,  the two teams again revisited the subject but on July 1, 2007 Carter signed a 4-year, $61.8 million contract with the Nets.<ref>[http://www.aolsportsblog.com/2007/05/26/ny-post-knicks-want-vince-carter/ NY Post: Knicks Want Vince Carter <U+2013> FanHouse <U+2013> AOL Sports Blog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

For the 2007<U+2013>08 season, Jason Kidd was traded mid season and [[Magic Johnson]] claimed that Carter's game was on the decline due to his bad knees.<ref>[http://videosearch.nba.com/search/?sp_a=sp10038c44&sp_f=ISO-8859-1&sp-t=video&sp_advanced=&sp_s=postdate&sp_k=wmvasf&sp_q=Vince+Carter%27s+Decline Top 5 of Inside #1: Vince Carter's Decline].

In it, [[Reggie Miller]] noted "Carter is probably the greatest dunker in the NBA I have ever seen." ESPN's Chris Broussard did a follow up piece in 2011 and called Vince Carter as the greatest in-game dunker of all time in the NBA. 

Carter ended up finishing strong in 2008 with a season average of at least 21 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists a game, a season accomplishment unique to him, Kobe Bryant, and Lebron James<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/3248/splits;_ylt=Ap9jKMFA9tI6lt4JiXFIc4qkvLYF Vince Carter <U+2013> New Jersey Nets <U+2013> Split Statistics <U+2013> NBA <U+2013> Yahoo!

For the [[2008<U+2013>09 NBA season|2008<U+2013>09 season]], the Nets decided to rebuild and Carter was voted team captain to help mentor the young players.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/steve_aschburner/03/31/carter/index.html</ref> Coach Lawrence Frank commented that Carter had "served the term 'captain' very honorably. Coming with a team that has veterans from other teams, some young guys coming straight from school, a couple of 20-year-olds and one 21-year-old. Showing them how you handle every day and the professionalism you approach your job [with], his disposition, his character. Plus, he's played at a very high level. He's accepted different roles on the team, at different times, to let other guys thrive and play at a high level, and yet has shown that he still is one of the elite players in the league." Two such players Carter helped mentor were Devin Harris and Brook Lopez. Brook Lopez finished 3rd in [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]] and Devin Harris made his 1st All-Star team and narrowly missed winning the [[NBA Most Improved Player]] award. Carter finished his last season as a Net scoring around the 20 points-five boards-five assists per game mark which were only shared among five other players: LeBron James, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Stephen Jackson, and Kobe Bryant.

On June 25, 2009, the day of the NBA Draft, Carter was traded to his hometown-team, the [[Orlando Magic]] with [[Ryan Anderson (basketball)|Ryan Anderson]] for [[Rafer Alston]], [[Tony Battie]] and [[Courtney Lee]]; the Magic were searching for a go-to scorer who could take pressure off [[Dwight Howard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4287197 |title=New Jersey Nets ship Vince Carter to Orlando Magic for Rafer Alston, rookie Courtney Lee <U+2013> ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> The Nets without Carter ended up going 12<U+2013>70.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nba/news/story?id=5178158</ref>
