{{nihongo|'''''Gauche the Cellist'''''|<U+30BB><U+30ED><U+5F3E><U+304D><U+306E><U+30B4><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30E5>|Sero Hiki no G<U+014D>shu|also transliterated ''Gorsch the Cellist'' or ''Goshu the Cellist''}} is a [[short story]] by the Japanese author [[Kenji Miyazawa]]. It is about Gauche, a struggling small town [[cellist]] who is inspired by his interactions with [[anthropomorphized]] animals to gain insight into music.  The story has been translated into English and Italian, and was adapted into a critically acclaimed [[anime]] in 1982 by [[Isao Takahata]].  It had previously been adapted to the screen several times.

==Synopsis==
Gauche is a diligent but mediocre [[cellist]] who plays for a small town orchestra (The Venus Orchestra, Japanese:<U+91D1><U+661F><U+97F3><U+697D><U+56E3>, Kinsei Ongaku Dan) and the local cinema in the early 20th century.  He struggles during [[rehearsal]]s and is often berated by his [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] during preparations for an upcoming performance of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth Symphony]] (the Pastoral Symphony).

Over the course of four nights, Gauche is visited at his [[gristmill|mill]] house home by talking animals as he is practicing.  The first night, a [[tortoiseshell cat]] came to Gauche and, giving him a tomato, asked him to play [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s "[[Tr<U+00E4>umerei]]." Gauche was irritated, as the tomato was from his garden outside, so he berated the cat and instead played "[[Tiger Hunt in India]]."  This startled the cat and made it leap up and down in astonishment.  The cat ran away in fright.

The second night as he was practicing, a [[cuckoo]] came to him asking to practice [[Musical scales|scales]] to Gauche's cello accompaniment.  Gauche repeatedly played "cuckoo, cuckoo," accompanied by the bird.  Eventually, he felt that the cuckoo's song was better than his cello.  Gauche chased the bird away, causing it to fly into his window, hitting its head.

The third night as he was practicing, a [[tanuki|raccoon dog (Japanese: <U+72F8>, tanuki)]] came to him asking to practice the [[timpany]] to Gauche's cello accompaniment.  As Gauche played "[[The Merry Master of a Coach Station]]," the tanuki hit the cello with a [[drum stick]].  The tanuki pointed out to Gauche that he played slowly despite trying to play speedily.  The two left on good terms as the day broke.

The fourth night as he was practicing, a mother mouse came in with her baby, asking him to heal her sick son.  When Gauche told her that he wasn't a doctor, she replied that the sound of his music had already healed a number of animals.  Gauche put the sick little mouse into a [[Sound-hole|hole]] of his cello and played a [[rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]].  When Gauche was finished, the little mouse was able to run around.  The mother mouse cried, thanked Gauche, and left.

The [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth Symphony]] concert was a great success.  In the dressing room, the [[Conducting|conductor]] asked a surprised Gauche to play an encore.  Upon hearing the applauding audience, Gauche thought he was being made a fool of and again played "Tiger Hunt in India."  Afterward, everybody in the dressing room congratulated him.

When he came back to his house, he opened the window where the cuckoo had hit its head and felt sorry for his actions.<ref>Adapted from synopsis at [http://kenji.cnu.ac.kr/kenji/works/dongwha/cello-eng/cello-eng.htm The World of Kenji Miyazawa]</ref>  The ending scenes shows the animals and Gauche at peace, playing to the music of the Pastoral symphony.
