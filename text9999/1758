'''Margaret Grace Bondfield''', [[Companion of Honour|CH]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (17 March 1873&nbsp;<U+2013> 16 June 1953) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician, trades unionist and women's rights activist. She became the first female cabinet minister, and the first woman to be a [[privy counsellor]], when she was appointed [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Minister of Labour]] in the [[Second MacDonald ministry|Labour government of 1929<U+2013>31]]. She had earlier become the first woman to chair the General Council of the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC).

Bondfield was born in humble circumstances and received limited formal education. After serving an apprenticeship to an embroidress she worked as a shop assistant in [[Brighton]] and London. She was shocked by the working conditions of shop staff, particularly within the "living-in" system, and became an active member of the shopworkers' union. She began to move in socialist circles, and in 1898 was appointed assistant secretary of the National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks (NAUSAWC). She was later prominent in several women's socialist movements: she helped to found the [[Women's Labour League]] (WLL) in 1906, and was chair of the Adult Suffrage Society. Her standpoint on women's suffrage<U+2014>she favoured extending the vote to all adults regardless of gender or property, rather than the limited "on the same terms as men" agenda pursued by the militant suffragists<U+2014>divided her from the militant leadership.

After leaving her union post in 1908 Bondfield worked as organising secretary for the WLL and later as women's officer for the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). She was elected to the TUC Council in 1918, and became its chairman in 1923, the year she was first elected to parliament. In the short-lived minority [[First MacDonald ministry|Labour government of 1924]] she served as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Labour. Her term of cabinet office in 1929<U+2013>31 was marked by the economic crises that beset the  second Labour government. Her willingness to contemplate cuts in unemployment benefit alienated her from much of the Labour movement, although she did not follow [[Ramsay MacDonald]] into the National Government that assumed office when the Labour government fell in August 1931.

Bondfield remained active in NUGMW affairs until 1938, and during the Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She died in 1953; despite her years of service to party and union, and her successes in breaking through gender boundaries, she has not been greatly honoured within the Labour movement. According to a later female cabinet minister, [[Barbara Castle]], Bondfield's actions in office had brought her close to betrayal of the movement.

Margaret Bondfield was born on 17 March 1873 in the [[Somerset]] town of [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]]. She was the tenth of eleven children, and third of four daughters born to William Bondfield and his wife Ann, n<U+00E9>e Taylor, the daughter of a [[Congregational Church|Congregational]] minister.<ref>Hamilton, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref><ref name= Mg353>Magill, p. 353</ref> William Bondfield worked as a lacemaker, and had a history of political activism.

===Early career===

====Shop worker====
[[File:Brighton aquarium photochrom.jpg|thumb|Brighton in the 1890s]]
Bondfield was apprenticed to a drapery and embroidery business in Church Road, Hove,<ref name= plaque/> where the young staff were treated as family members. Relations between customers and assistants were cordial, and Bondfield's later recollections of this period were uniformly happy.<ref>Bondfield, p. 24</ref> Her apprenticeship complete, she worked as a living-in assistant in a succession of Brighton drapery stores, where she quickly encountered the realities of shop staff life: unsympathetic employers, very long hours, appalling living conditions and no privacy.<ref>Hamilton, pp. 43<U+2013>4</ref> Bondfield reported on her experiences of living-in: "Overcrowded, insanitary conditions, poor and insufficient food were the main characteristics of this system, with an undertone of danger&nbsp;... In some houses both natural and unnatural vices found a breeding ground".<ref>Quoted in Sanders, pp. 45<U+2013>46, from ''The Meaning of Trade'' (1928). London, E.G Benn. OCLC 56418171</ref> She found some relief from this environment when she was befriended by a wealthy customer, [[Louisa Martindale (feminist)|Louisa Martindale]], and her daughter Hilda. The Martindales, socially-conscious liberals and advocates for women's rights, found Bondfield a willing learner, and lent her books that began her lifelong interest in labour and social questions. Bondfield described Mrs Martindale as "a most vivid influence on my life&nbsp;... she put me in the way of knowledge that has been of help to many score of my shop mates".<ref>Martindale, pp. 34<U+2013>35, quoting Bondfield</ref>
[[File:Beatrice & Sidney Webb, c1895.jpg|thumb|left|Beatrice and Sidney Webb, circa 1895; they were among Bondfield's early socialist acquaintances]]
Bondfield's brother Frank had established himself in London some years earlier as a printer and trades unionist,<ref>Sanders, p. 217</ref> and in 1894, having saved <U+00A3>5, she decided to join him. She found London shopworking conditions no better than in Brighton,<ref name= Ab220>Abrams, p. 220</ref> but through Frank her social and political circles widened. She became an active member of the [[Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers|National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks]] (NUSAWC), sometimes missing church on Sundays to attend union meetings.<ref>Cox and Hobley, p. 93</ref> Her political and literary education was centred on the Ideal Club, where she met [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]]. Under the influence of these socialist luminaries, she joined the [[Fabian Society]] and later the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP).<ref name= Mg353/><ref name= Law28>Law, pp. 28<U+2013>30</ref>

As a shopworker, Bondfield was expected to work between 80 and 100 hours a week for 51 weeks in the year,<ref>Cox and Hobley, p. 42</ref> and might be sent out late at night to check that rival shops had closed before her employer would do so.<ref>Bondfield, p. 62</ref>{{#tag:ref|In 1873 the Liberal MP [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]] had introduced a parliamentary bill to limit shopworkers' hours to ten and a half per day. The House of Commons rejected the bill, on the grounds that unlike factory work, shopwork "could hardly be considered fatiguing, much less unwholesome".<ref>Cox and Hornby, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref> |group= n}} She began to record her experiences, in a series of articles and stories that she wrote under the pseudonym "Grace Dare", for the shopworkers' monthly magazine ''The Shop Assistant''.<ref name= Ab220/><ref>Sanders, pp. 46 and 48<U+2013>53</ref> She wrote surreptitiously, at night: "I would light my half-penny dip [candle], hiding its glare by means of a towel and set to work on my monthly article".<ref>Bondfield, p. 28</ref> In 1896 she was recruited by the Women's Industrial Council (WIC) as an undercover agent, working in various shops while secretly recording every aspect of shop life. Her accounts of squalor and exploitation were published in articles under the "Grace Dare" name, in both ''The Shop Assistant'' and the ''[[Daily Chronicle]]'' newspaper, and provided the basis for a WIC report on shopworkers' conditions published in 1898.<ref name= Cox95>Cox and Hobley, pp. 95<U+2013>97</ref>

====Union official====
[[File:Bondfield on tour.jpg|thumb|Cartoon showing Bondfield addressing a NAUSAWC recruitment meeting, July 1898]]
In 1898 Bondfield accepted the job of assistant secretary of NUSAWC,<ref name= Mg353/><ref name= odnbB>{{cite web|last= Williamson|first= Philip|title= Bondfield, Margaret Grace|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31955?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|accessdate= 21 August 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> which that year became "NAUSAWC" after amalgamating with another shopworkers' union.<ref>{{cite web| title= The 1890s: USDAW in the Making|url= https://www.usdaw.org.uk/aboutus/usdawshistory/14the1890susdawinthem.aspx|publisher= Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers|accessdate= 21 August 2014}}</ref> From this time onward she subordinated her life to her union work and to the wider cause of socialism. She "had no vocation for wifehood or motherhood, but an urge to serve the Union&nbsp;... I had 'the dear love of comrades' ".<ref>Bondfield, p. 36.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The quotation is from No. 24 of the ''[[Calamus (poems)|Calamus]]'' poems, which form part of [[Walt Whitman]]'s ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title= Books by Whitman: Leaves of Grass (1860)|url= http://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1860/index.html|publisher= The Walt Whitman Archive|accessdate= 20 September 2014}}</ref>|group= n}} At the time the union's membership, at under 3,000, represented only a small fraction of shopworkers, and Bondfield gave priority to increasing this proportion.{{#tag:ref|Cox and Hobley, in their history of "life behind the counter", give the union's membership at the time as 2,000;<ref>Cox and Hobley, p. 99</ref> Frank Magill, in his ''Dictionary of World Biography'', states a figure of 2,897.<ref name= Mg353/> |group= n}} For months she travelled the country, distributing literature and arranging meetings when she could, with mixed outcomes in the face of apathy from shop staff, and outright opposition from shopowners. In [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and Bristol she reported no success, although in [[Gloucester]], she thought, "it should not be difficult to organise every shop worker".<ref>Bondfield, "Miss Bondfield on Tour", ''The Shop Assistant'', July 1898, quoted in Cox and Hobley, pp. 100<U+2013>01</ref> In 1899 Bondfield was the first woman delegate to the [[Trades Union Congress|Trades Union Annual Congress]], that year held in [[Plymouth]],<ref>Cox and Hobley, p. 102</ref> where she participated in the vote that led to the formation in 1900 of the [[Labour Representation Committee (1900)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), forerunner of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>Pelling, pp. 204<U+2013>06</ref> NAUSAWC, its membership by then around 7,000, was one of the first unions to affiliate to the committee.<ref>Collette, p. 28</ref>
 
In 1902 Bondfield met [[Mary Macarthur]], some eight years her junior, who chaired the [[Ayr]] branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the daughter of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch of the Shop Assistants' Union transformed her into an ardent trades unionist.<ref>{{cite web|last= John|first= Angela|title= Macarthur [married name Anderson], Mary Reid|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30411|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|accessdate= 21 August 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the [[Women's Trade Union League (United Kingdom)|Women's Trade Union League]].<ref name= A223>Abrams, pp. 223<U+2013>24</ref> The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next two decades, in a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield's more intimate friendships tended to be with women rather than men;<ref>Sanders, p. 48</ref> Bondfield's biographer Mary Agnes Hamilton described Macarthur as the romance of Bondfield's life.<ref>Hamilton, p. 96</ref>

The year 1904 saw the passage of the Shop Hours Act, which made some provision for limiting shop hours.{{#tag:ref|The Act gave local councils the power to fix trading hours, provided they could get the agreement of at least two-thirds of shopowners. Not until the Shops Act of 1911 did it become a statutory requirement that shopworkers had a half-day's holiday each week.<ref>{{cite web|last= Kay|first= J.A. et al.|title= The Regulation of Retail Trading Hours|url= http://www.ifs.org.uk/comms/r13.pdf|publisher= The Institute of Fiscal Studies|date= 1984}}</ref>|group= n}} In 1907 the first steps were taken to end the Victorian "living-in" practice, which at the time still affected two-thirds of Britain's 750,000 shopworkers.<ref>Cox and Hobley, p. 108</ref> Initially, living-out privileges were only given to male employees; Bondfield campaigned for equivalent rights for women shop workers, arguing that if they were to become "useful, healthy&nbsp;... wives and mothers", they needed to live "rational lives".<ref>Cox and Hobley, p. 109</ref> As part of her campaign, Bondfield advised the playwright [[Cicely Hamilton]], whose shop-based drama ''Diana of Dobsons'' appeared that year. Bondfield described the opening scene, set in a dreary, comfortless women's dormitory over a shop, as very like the real thing.<ref>Bondfield, p. 72</ref>

From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was increasingly occupied with the issue of women's suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the [[Adult Suffrage Society]] (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property.<ref name= A223/> In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by [[Sir Charles Dilke]].<ref name= A225>Abrams, pp. 225<U+2013>26</ref> This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was "[[Filibuster|talked out]]" in the House of Commons,<ref>{{cite journal|title= Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities Bill|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1906/mar/02/franchise-and-removal-of-womens#S4V0152P0_19060302_HOC_85|publisher= Hansard|date= 2 March 1906|volume= 152|pages= col. 1448<U+2013>53}}</ref> but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, in the course of a public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification.<ref>Holton, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> She wished good luck to those fighting for a "same terms as men" suffrage bill, but "don't let them come and tell me that they are working for my class".<ref name= B83>Bondfield, p. 83</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Adult Suffrage Society was relaunched in 1909 as the People's Suffrage Federation (PSF), under the leadership of Margaret Llewellyn Davies.<ref>{{cite journal|title= The People's Suffrage Federation|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1790&dat=19091021&id=35U9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=tisMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2314,5220205|journal= The Common Cause|date= 21 October 1909|page= p. 8}}</ref>|group= n}} The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000.<ref>Hamilton, p. 61</ref> Her departure, she said, was "alike a grief and a deliverance".<ref>Bondfield, p. 60</ref>

After leaving NAUSAWC, Bondfield transferred the main focus of her energies to the [[Women's Labour League]] (WLL), which she had helped to found in 1906.<ref name= odnbB/> The League's principal aims were "to work for independent labour representation in connection with the Labour Party, and to obtain direct labour representation of women in Parliament and on all local bodies."<ref>{{cite web|title= Women, the Vote and Labour 1906<U+2013>1918|url= http://www.co-op.ac.uk/politicalwomen/cs4.html|publisher= National Co-operative Archive|accessdate= 23 August 2014}}</ref> The president of the League was [[Margaret MacDonald (social reformer)|Margaret MacDonald]], wife of the future Labour Party leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]];<ref>{{cite web|first= Hannam|last= June|title= MacDonald, Margaret Ethel Gladstone|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45462?docPos=3|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|accessdate= 23 August 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Bondfield had known the MacDonalds since the 1890s, through their joint work for the WIC.<ref name= Mg353/>

With a government suffrage reform bill pending in parliament, the WLL introduced a motion to the 1909 Labour Party conference committing the party to oppose any suffrage extension bill that did not specifically include women. However, while the party was largely sympathetic to the principle of women's suffrage, it was unwilling to risk losing the limited reforms to male suffrage promised by the government's bill. When Bondfield tabled the WLL motion at the Labour conference, she was persuaded by [[Arthur Henderson]] to water it down.<ref name= CC/> Many suffragists reacted angrily; the WSPU accused the WLL, and Bondfield in particular, of treachery. Fran Abrams, in a biographical essay, writes that although Bondfield "was prepared to argue loud and long for adult suffrage,&nbsp;... she was not prepared to damage her relationship with the Labour Party for it".<ref name= A225/>

Since the passing of the Qualification of Women Act in 1907, women had been eligible to vote in and stand as candidates in municipal elections.<ref>Wilson, p. 48</ref> Several WLL members contested the [[London County Council]] elections in 1910; Bondfield stood in [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich|Woolwich]], unsuccessfully (she contested the same seat in 1913, with a similar result).<ref name= Law28/><ref name= A227>Abrams, p. 227</ref> The League was active in all types of elections, supporting and canvassing for candidates of either sex who spoke out for women's rights. Through these activities Bondfield experienced the lives of the poorest of families, writing: "Oh! the lonely lives of these women, hidden away at the back of a network of small, mean streets!"<ref>Collette, pp. 99<U+2013>102</ref>

Alongside her WLL duties, Bondfield maintained a range of other involvements. She spent part of 1910 in the United States, lecturing on suffrage issues with Maud Ward of the People's Suffrage Federation (PSF), and studying labour problems.<ref name= A225/><ref name= Mg354>Magill, p. 354</ref> At home, she worked with the [[Women's Co-operative Guild]] (WCG) on maternity and child welfare, and was co-opted to the Parliamentary Standing Committee which piloted the introduction of state maternity benefits and other assistance to mothers.<ref name= Law28/><ref>Scott, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref> Her investigation on behalf of the WIC into the working conditions in the textile industries led her to join most of the Labour leadership in a "War against Poverty" campaign.<ref name= A227/> In 1910 Bondfield accepted the chairmanship of the British section of the Women's International Council of Socialist and Labour Organisations.<ref>Collette, p. 70</ref>

Between 1908 and 1910 the WLL and the WIC co-operated in a nationwide investigation of married women's working conditions. Bondfield carried out the fieldwork in Yorkshire. The relationship between the two bodies was sometimes fractious, and when the report was due to be published, there were disagreements over how it should be handled. As a result of these and other clashes, Bondfield, MacDonald and the other League women resigned from the Council.<ref>Collette, p. 119</ref> In 1911 Bondfield assumed the role of the WLL's Organising Secretary,<ref>Abrams, p. 228</ref> and spent much of the year travelling: she formed a WLL branch in [[Ogmore Vale]], [[Glamorgan]],<ref>Collette, p. 84</ref> reformed the Manchester branch,<ref>Collette, p. 89</ref> and found time to advise laundrywomen engaged in a dispute in South Wales.<ref>Collete, p. 66</ref> The sudden death of Mary MacDonald in September 1911 added considerably to Bondfield's workload; the strain, together with internal animosities within the WLL, led her to resign her position in January 1912. The League made strenuous efforts to retain her, and only in September did its committee reluctantly accept her departure. An attempt to re-engage her in 1913 was unsuccessful, and [[Marion Phillips]] was appointed to succeed her.<ref>Collette, pp. 132<U+2013>34</ref>{{#tag:ref|The WLL continued until 1918, when it evolved into the Women's Section of the Labour Party.<ref>{{cite web|title= Labour History Archive and Study Centre|url= http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb394-wll|publisher= Archives hub|accessdate= 7 September 2014}}</ref> |group= n}}

===Campaigns and war===

In March 1915 she attended a conference in [[Berne]], Switzerland, organised by the Women's International of Socialist and Labour Organizations, which called for a negotiated peace. Later in the war the government, concerned by Bondfield's association with peace organisations, prevented her from travelling to similar gatherings in Sweden and the United States.<ref name= Mg354/>

Bondfield had helped Mary Macarthur to found the [[National Federation of Women Workers]] (NFWW) in 1906.

Following two years of negotiation, in 1920 the NFWW voted to merge with the National Union of General Workers and become that union's Women's Section.

====First Labour Government====
[[File:Ramsay MacDonald - Punch cartoon - Project Gutenberg eText 17629.png|thumb|The Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald, depicted in a hostile ''Punch'' cartoon. The luggage label, marked "Petrograd", links him to Russia and communism.]]
The Liberal Party's decision not to enter a coalition with the Conservatives, and Baldwin's unwillingness to govern without a majority, led to Ramsay MacDonald's first minority Labour government, which took office in January 1924.<ref>Blythe, p. 278</ref> According to Lansbury's biographer, Bondfield turned down the offer of a cabinet post;<ref>Shepherd, p. 208</ref> instead, she became parliamentary secretary to the [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]], [[Tom Shaw (politician)|Tom Shaw]]. This appointment meant that she had to give up the TUC Council chair; her decision to do so, immediately after becoming the first woman to achieve this honour, generated some criticism from other trade unionists.<ref>Hunt, pp. 114<U+2013>15</ref>

Bondfield later described her first months in government as "a strange adventure".<ref>Bondfield, p. 255</ref> The difficulties of the economic situation would have created problems for the most experienced of governments, and the fledgling Labour administration was quickly in difficulties.<ref name= A229/> Bondfield spent much of her time abroad; in the autumn she travelled to Canada as the head of a delegation examining the problems of British immigrants, especially as related to the welfare of young children.<ref>Boucher, pp. 85<U+2013>87</ref> When she returned to Britain in early October she found the government in its final throes. On 8 October MacDonald resigned after losing a confidence vote in the House of Commons.<ref>Marquand, p. 377</ref> Labour's chances of victory in the ensuing general election were fatally compromised by the controversy surrounding the so-called [[Zinoviev letter]], a missive purportedly sent by [[Grigory Zinoviev]], president of the [[Communist International]], which called on Britain's socialists to prepare for violent revolution. The letter, published four days before polling day, generated a "Red Scare" that led to a significant swing of voters to the right, and ensured a massive Conservative victory.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Andrew|first= Christopher|title= The British Secret Service and Anglo-Soviet Relations in the 1920s Part I: From the Trade Negotiations to the Zinoviev Letter|url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=3290240|journal= The Historical Journal|volume= 20|issue= 3|date= September 1977|pages= 673<U+2013>706}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref name= Marq381>Marquand, pp. 381<U+2013>86</ref>{{#tag:ref| The Conservative victory resulted from the collapse of the Liberal vote; Labour obtained a million more votes than in 1923, and its share of the poll likewise increased.<ref name= Marq381/> |group= n}} Bondfield lost her seat in Northampton by 971 votes.<ref>{{cite news|title= Death of Sir A.

Bondfield's association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.<ref name= A231/>

On 29 March 1928, when a bill providing for full adult suffrage came before parliament, she termed it "a tremendous social advance", and added: "At last [women] are established on that equitable footing because we are human beings and part of society as a whole&nbsp;... once and for all, we shall destroy the artificial barrier in the way of any women who want to get education in politics and who want to come forward and take their full share in the political life of their day".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Bill |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1928/mar/29/representation-of-the-people-equal#S5CV0215P0_19280329_HOC_293 |journal= Hansard|date= 29 March 1928|volume= 215|pages= col.1415 }}</ref> When the bill became law, 4 million voters, most of them women, were added to the register. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]], held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers.<ref name= A231/><ref name= Craig/> The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.<ref>Marquand, p. 488</ref>

====Minister of Labour====
[[File:Photo 7 Council 1938, WRI George Lansbury head crop.jpg|thumb|left|Of the 1929<U+2013>31 Labour cabinet ministers who opposed the formation of a National Government in August 1931, only George Lansbury retained his seat in the ensuing general election.]]

When Bondfield accepted the post of Minister of Labour in the new government, she became Britain's first woman cabinet minister, and Britain's first woman [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy counsellor]].<ref name= odnbB/><ref>Marquand, p. 492</ref> She considered the appointment "part of the great revolution in the position of women".<ref>Bondfield, p. 276</ref> Her period in office was dominated by the issue of rising unemployment and the consequent increasing costs of benefit, which created a division between the government, anxious to demonstrate its financial responsibility, and the wider Labour movement whose priority was to protect the unemployed. According to the historian [[Robert Skidelsky]]: "Ministers worried about the finances of the [unemployment] fund; backbenchers worried about the finances of the unemployed".<ref>Skidelsky, pp. 100<U+2013>01</ref> Under increasing pressure from the TUC, Bondfield introduced a bill which reversed the "Blanesburgh" restrictions on unemployment benefit introduced by the previous government, but with visible reluctance. Her handling of this issue is described by Marquand as "maladroit",<ref>Marquand, p. 525</ref> and by Skidelsky as showing "monumental tactlessness".<ref>Skidelsky, p. 160</ref>

As the cost of unemployment benefits mounted, Bondfield's attempts to control the fund's deficit provoked further hostility from the TUC and political attacks from the opposition parties.<ref name= odnbB/> In February 1931 she proposed a scheme to cut benefit and restrict entitlement, but this was rejected by the cabinet as too harsh. Instead, seeking a cross-party solution, the government accepted a Liberal proposal for an independent committee, eventually set up under [[George May, 1st Baron May|Sir George May]], to report on how public expenditure might be reduced.<ref>Marquand, pp. 588<U+2013>90</ref> With the collapse in May 1931 of Austria's leading private bank, [[Creditanstalt|Kreditanstalt]], and the subsequent failure of several other European banks, the sense of crisis deepened.<ref>Hefferman, p. 360</ref> On 30 July the May committee recommended cuts in expenditure of <U+00A3>97 million, the majority (<U+00A3>67 million) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs.<ref>Marquand, p. 609</ref> In the ensuing weeks, ministers struggled vainly to meet these demands. Bondfield was prepared to cut general unemployment benefit, provided the most needy recipients<U+2014>those on so-called "transitional benefit"<U+2014>were protected.<ref>Marquand, p. 619</ref> No formula could be found; by 23 August the cabinet was hopelessly split, and resigned the next day. To the outrage of the TUC and most of the Labour Party, MacDonald formed an emergency National Government with the Conservative and Liberal parties, while the bulk of the Labour Party went into opposition.<ref>Blythe, pp. 282<U+2013>83</ref>

Bondfield did not join the small number of Labour MPs who chose to follow MacDonald, although she expressed her "deep sympathy and admiration" for his actions.<ref name= odnbB/><ref>Marquand, p. 648</ref> In the general election which followed on 27 October 1931, the Labour Party lost more than three-quarters of its Commons seats and was reduced to 52 members. Bondfield was defeated in Wallsend by 7,606 votes; Abrams observes that given the attacks on her from both right and left, "it would have been a miracle had she been re-elected".<ref name= A234>Abrams, p. 234</ref> Of the former Labour cabinet members who opposed the National Government, only Lansbury kept his seat.<ref name= Craig/><ref>Marquand, p. 670</ref>

===Late career===
After her defeat, Bondfield returned to her NUGMW post. The TUC, suspicious of her perceived closeness to MacDonald, was cool towards her and she was not re-elected to the General Council.<ref name= odnbB/> She remained Labour's candidate at Wallsend; in the general election of 1935 she was again defeated.<ref name= Craig/> She never returned to parliament; she was adopted as the prospective Labour candidate for Reading, but when it became obvious that the election due for 1940 would be delayed indefinitely by war, she resigned her candidacy.<ref name= A234/>

In 1938, after retiring from her NUGMW post,<ref name= odnbB/> Bondfield founded the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She studied labour conditions in the United States and Mexico during 1938, and toured the US and Canada after the outbreak of war in 1939, as a lecturer for the British Information Services.<ref name= Law28/><ref name= Mg356/> Her attitude towards the war was different from her semi-pacifist stance of 1914; she actively supported the government and, in 1941, published a booklet, ''Why Labour Fights''.<ref name= A234/><ref>{{cite web|title= Why Labour Fights|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/why-labour-fights/oclc/46668473|publisher= WorldCat|date= 1941|accessdate= 1 September 2014}}</ref> Her main wartime activity was leading an investigation by the Hygiene Committee of the Women's Group on Public Welfare, into the problems that arose from the large-scale evacuation into the countryside of city children. The group's findings were published in 1943, as ''Our Towns: a Close-up''; the report gave many people their first understanding of the extent of inner-city poverty.<ref name= A234/> Suggested solutions included nursery education, a minimum wage, child allowances and a national health service. The report was reprinted several times, and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|last= Holman|first= Bob|title= Social deprivation?

In his biographical sketch for the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Philip Williamson depicts Bondfield as "physically short and stout&nbsp;... with sparkling eyes, a firm, brisk manner, and effective, sometimes inspired, public speaking".<ref name= odnbB/> She had the self-confidence to exist and thrive in a male-dominated world,<ref name= vallance/> deriving inspiration from a childhood which, though materially impoverished, her obituarist has described as "of great spiritual and mental wealth".<ref name= obit>{{cite news|title= Miss Margaret Bondfield|url= http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver/docview/479495217/B83AC856EC394D97PQ/1?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|date= 18 June 1953|page= 3}} {{subscription}}</ref> She inherited a strong [[nonconformist]] faith, which became a key element throughout her later career,<ref name="Worley, p. 180">Worley, p. 180</ref> and retained her links with the Congregational Church throughout her life.<ref>Biagini, p. 222</ref> After her death ''The Times'' praised her "unusually wide human sympathies&nbsp;... her generous nature and real sense of humour".<ref>Quoted in Abrams, p. 235</ref> Skidelsky, however, describes her unsympathetically as "a humourless and somewhat priggish person, with long black skirts and a voice that emitted a harsh cascade of sound".<ref>Skidelsky, p. 89</ref>

Bondfield's career was punctuated by "firsts", in union, parliament and government spheres.<ref name= linda>{{cite news|last= Christmas|first= Linda|title= Country Matters|url= http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver/docview/185666952/80F053A7A564006PQ/4?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 19 March 1973|page= 9}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref name= BBC/> Her own view of these achievements was modest: "Some woman was bound to be first. That I should be was the accident of dates and events".<ref name= vallance/> Her appointment as Minister of Labour propelled her into what was, in 1929, the hardest job in the cabinet,<ref name= obit/> and in common with other ministers, her lack of experience in government left her heavily dependent on her official advisers.<ref>Skidelsky, p. 430</ref> By temperament a realist, she based her actions in government on economic facts rather on party or sectional interests;<ref name= Mg356/> thus she became "caught between the opposition claims that she was soft on the unemployed, and her own backbenchers' jibe that she had abandoned the workers".<ref name= vallance/> Her stance, and her seemingly equivocal attitude towards MacDonald's apostasy, reduced her standing in her own party for decades, so that when [[Barbara Castle]] was appointed as Minister of Labour by [[Harold Wilson]] in 1968, she insisted that the ministry's name be changed to "Department of Employment", for fear of association with Bondfield's term in office.<ref>{{cite news|last= Colemen|first= Terry|title= The tigress still burns bright|url= http://search.proquest.com/hnpguardianobserver/docview/187378254/80F053A7A564006PQ/16?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 5 June 1993|page= 29}} {{subscription}}</ref> Castle refused to contribute a preface to Fabian Society booklet celebrating Bondfield's life, because she considered her predecessor's actions close to political betrayal.<ref>Abrams, p. 217</ref> In 2001, a speech by [[Tony Blair]] celebrating the Labour Party's 100 years in parliament paid tributes to many heroes of the movement's early years; Bondfield's name was not mentioned.<ref>Abrams, p. 218</ref>

Bondfield was awarded an honorary [[Honorary degree|Doctor of Laws]] degree by the [[University of Bristol]], and in 1930 received the [[Freedom of the City|freedom of the borough]] from her home town of Chard,<ref name= Mg353/> where in 2011 a plaque in her honour was fixed to the Guildhall wall.<ref name= BBC>{{cite web|title= Chard blue plaque celebrates MP Margaret Bondfield|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/somerset/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9343000/9343583.stm|publisher= BBC Somerset|date= 6 January 2011|accessdate= 5 September 2014}}</ref> In 1948 she was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] (CH).<ref>{{cite journal|title= Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood|url= https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/38161/supplement/31/data.pdf|journal= The London Gazette (Supplement)|date= 1 January 1948|page= p. 31}}</ref> Many years after her death, streets and apartment buildings were named after her in the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] and [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham|Barking]];<ref>{{cite web|title= Margaret Bondfield Avenue, Barking|url= https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF-8&fb=1&gl=uk&sll=51.5380139,0.1058227&sspn=0.0205005,0.0439461&q=Margaret+Bondfield+Ave,+Barking+IG11,+UK&ei=9rQJVIjQNZOO7QbE4YCAAw&ved=0CBUQ8gEoATAA|publisher= Google Maps|accessdate= 5 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF-8&fb=1&gl=uk&sll=51.5380139,0.1058227&sspn=0.0205005,0.0439461&q=Margaret+Bondfield+Ave,+Barking+IG11,+UK&ei=9rQJVIjQNZOO7QbE4YCAAw&ved=0CBUQ8gEoATAA|title= Margaret Bondfield House, Driffield Road, Bow|publisher= Google Maps|accessdate= 5 September 2014}}</ref> she was further commemorated in her old constituency of Northampton when a hall of residence in the [[University of Northampton]] was named the Margaret Bondfield Hall.<ref>{{cite web|title= New Margaret Bondfield Halls, Park Campus Northampton|url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/universityofnorthamptonarchives/6252884795/|publisher= University of Northampton|date= May 1992|accessdate= 5 September 2014}}</ref> In 2014 a campaign began for a plaque on the shop in Church Street, Hove, where in 1886<U+2013>67 Bondfield had served her apprenticeship.<ref name= plaque>{{cite web|title= Hove blue plaque call for 1920s MP Margaret Bondfield|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-27654880|publisher= BBC News Sussex|date= 1 June 2014|accessdate= 5 September 2014}}</ref>

To mark Bondfield's centenary in 1973, Linda Christmas in ''The Guardian'' reviewed the progress of women in parliament since the 1930s. To that point, Christmas reported, only 93 women had sat in parliament; their contributions had overall "not been stunning".<ref name= linda/> Their best numerical showing had been in the 1966 general election, when 29 women (out of 630 MPs) had been elected. The 1979 election saw this number fall to 19, but also saw [[Margaret Thatcher]] become Britain's first woman prime minister.<ref name= women>{{cite web|url= http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN01250.pdf|title= Women in Parliament and Government|date= 17 July 2014|publisher= House of Commons Library|accessdate= 5 September 2014}}</ref>{{#tag:ref| After 1979 the numbers of elected women rose at successive general elections, reaching 120 in 1997 and 143 in 2010.<ref name= women/> |group= n}} Cox and Hobley draw attention to Thatcher's early life as a shopkeeper's daughter, and contrast her account of those days with Bondfield's experiences half a century earlier. Thatcher believed that the concept of service to the customer was absolute; thus, Cox and Hobley assert, she would have had little sympathy for Bondfield's campaigns to better shopworkers' conditions.<ref>Cox and Hobley, pp. 230<U+2013>32</ref> Despite the changes that have taken place in the retail industry since Bondfield's day, Cox and Hobley believe that, were she alive, "she'd still be champing at the bit, trying to coax shop assistants to join a union, and fiercely championing shopworkers' rights to better pay and conditions".<ref>Cox and Hobley, p. 235</ref>
