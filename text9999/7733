'''''Omkara''''' ([[Hindi]]: <U+0913><U+092E><U+0915><U+093E><U+0930><U+093E>, [[Urdu]]: <U+0627><U+0645><U+06A9><U+0627><U+0631><U+0627>) is a [[2006]] [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]<U+2019>s ''[[Othello]]'' directed by [[Vishal Bharadwaj]]. It starred [[Ajay Devgan]], [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Kareena Kapoor]] in lead roles, supported by [[Vivek Oberoi]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]] and [[Konkona Sen Sharma]] with a <U+2018><U+2019>special appearance<U+2019><U+2019> from [[Bipasha Basu]]. The director [[Vishal Bharadwaj]] himself composed the entire music for the film, including the [[film score|background score]], with song lyrics by [[Gulzar]]. 

The film was showcased in the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]] along with a book on the making of Omkara.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/films/bollywood/2006/05/omkara_preview.shtml|work=BBC website|title=Omkara film preview|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> It was also selected to be screened at the [[Cairo International Film Festival]] & [[Pakistan]]'s prestigious [[Kara Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/happenings/20061226-0.html|work=Apun Ka Choice|title='Omkara' shines in Cairo and Karachi|accessdate=2006-12-26}}</ref> 

It became part of a series of film interpretations of popular literary works by Bharadwaj, made after [[Maqbool]] based on [[Macbeth]] and [[Chatri Chor]] based on [[Ruskin Bond]]'s [[The Blue Umbrella]], though it should be noted that Omkara was released before Chatri Chor. 

==Plot==

Omkara Shukla or Omi ([[Ajay Devgan]]) is a ''baahubali'', a sort of political [[enforcer]]. He is the leader of a gang which carries out political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]). Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyay ([[Vivek Oberoi]]) are his closest [[lieutenant]]s.
[[Image:Kareena in Omkara.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kareena Kapoor]] as Dolly Mishra]]

The movie starts with Langda Tyagi [[Wiktionary|hijacking]] a [[baraat]] and sending Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the [[bridegroom]] to try and stop Omkara from abducting the [[bride]] Dolly Mishra ([[Kareena Kapoor]]). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place. 

Dolly<U+2019>s father [[Advocate]] Ragunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as <U+201C>vakeel saab<U+201D> (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omi<U+2019>s head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Vakeel saab grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring a final solution to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi rather than being abducted forcefully. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed.

After some crafty political arm-twisting, involving a [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] [[sex scandal]], Omkara eliminates a powerful [[electoral]] rival.  Bhaisaab is elected for [[Lok Sabha|Parliament]] and Omkara is promoted from <U+201C>bahubali<U+201D> to the candidate for the upcoming [[Vidhan Sabha|state]] elections. Omkara appoints Kesu over Langda as his successor once he enters politics himself. Langda, disappointed with Omkara's poor judgment and jealous of Kesu, his younger, less-experienced, superior; hatches a plot to revenge both his offenders. He first causes a violent brawl between Kesu and Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), Dolly<U+2019>s original suitor by taking advantage of Kesu's low threshold for alcohol. Such irresponsible behaviour of Kesu infuriates Omi, who now starts becoming unsure about his own decision. 
[[Image:OmkaraStill.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Still from the film featuring (l-r) [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Ajay Devgan]]]]

On one hand, playing the role of a concerned friend Langda convinces Kesu to appeal to Dolly, Omi's lover and bride-to-be to mollify Omi. On the other he starts to disrepute Dolly by implicating Kesu's visits to ask Dolly for her help as meetings in an illicit love affair between the two. A kamarbandh, a piece of traditional jewellery worn around the waist, carelessly dropped by Dolly and stolen by Langda<U+2019>s wife Indu ([[Konkona Sen Sharma]]), which eventually reaches Billo Chamanbahar ([[Bipasha Basu]]) as a gift from Kesu, plays an important part in the plot, as evidence of Dolly<U+2019>s [[infidelity]]. 

By the time of the climax, the night of their wedding, Omi is convinced that Dolly and Kesu have been having an affair behind his back. In utter rage, he [[smothers]] his new wife to death. Langda [[shooting|shoots]] Kesu with a silent approval from Omi. Hearing gunshots and in shock Indu enters the room where Omi is sitting next to Dolly<U+2019>s [[corpse]] in remorse. Indu notices the kamarbandh and mentions stealing it, they both understand the fatal misunderstanding and Langda as its root cause. 

In retribution, Indu slashes Langda's throat and Omi commits suicide. The movie closes with Omi lying dead of the floor and Dolly<U+2019>s dead body [[Swing (seat)|swinging]] above his.

==Shooting Location==
''Omkara'' was shot over a period of 4 months across various locales, including [[Lonavala]], [[Lucknow University]], [[Allahabad]], [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Mahabaleshwar]], [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]] and [[Mumbai]]. Bulk of the shooting for the film took place in [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]] [[Maharashtra]]. Even though most of the shooting took place in Maharashtra, sets were erected with precise details to create an authentic [[Uttar Pradesh]] village.

==Production Notes==
Other members of the production team included stunts co-ordinator Jai Singh, costume designer Dolly Ahluwalia, choreographers Bhushan Lakhandri and Ganesh Acharya along with chief assistant director Ajit Ahuja. 
The title of the film was decide by a popular vote. Moviegoers had a choice between ''Omkara'', ''Issak'' and ''O Saathi Re'', all of which had already appeared on the soundtrack as song titles.

== Response ==
''Omkara'' had a poor opening at the box office in India. The dark theme and strong language kept away family audiences. It was however a grand success abroad. The film quickly entered the UK's Top Ten and also did very well in [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]]. Though the film was not a huge commercial success in India, it was critically acclaimed universally. Rediff.com writes: "Vishal Bhardwaj's film is a superlative-exhausting work of passion and tribute, skill and style...Spellbinding stuff". The film was praised for its taut script, brilliantly executed drama sequences and its lead performances. Kareena Kapoor's performance was considered to be the finest of her films. However, Saif Ali Khan drew the most praise for his villainous role as Langda Tyagi.

== Language ==
All the dialogues in the film are delivered in a strong [[Uttar pradesh|UP]] [[dialect]] of [[Hindi]], including the use of swear words, generally absent from mainstream Hindi cinema. The movie received an [[Central Board of Film Certification#Rating system|A Certificate]] from the [[Central Board of Film Certification|censor board of India]]. Critics and audiences were divided in their opinions about the foul language. Many believed that it was not required and would lead to distancing the movie from the family audience,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1833494.cms|work=The Times of India|title=Families stay away from Omkara|accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref> while on the other hand some applauded it for authentically showing the rustic setting of the story. The language and A certificate narrowed the audience but in turn brought accolades for the creators of the movie for valuing creativity over commercial success
<blockquote>''A thin line (or thread) separates the fool from the fucker. On one end of the line lies the fool and on the other, the fucker. Upon snapping the line it's a million dollar question as to who's the fool and who's the fucker, my friend. Let's see the face of the pretty bridegroom now. Well, I'll be damned. Surely you are the fool, right? 'Coz a man becomes a fucker only after his wedding.''</blockquote>

===Trivia===

* Adaption of Othello

The exact same [[dialogue (fiction)|dialogues]] were repeated in the movie at different points in the screenplay by the same or different characters, acting like [[catchphrases]]. Some examples have been listed below
