'''Bali''' is an [[Indonesia]]n [[island]] located in the westernmost end of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], lying between [[Java (island)|Java]] to the west and [[Lombok]] to the east. It is one of the country's 33 [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] with the provincial capital at [[Denpasar]] towards the south of the island (strictly speaking, the province covers a few small neighbouring islands as well as the isle of Bali).

With a population recorded as 3,891,000 in the 2010 census,<ref>http://www.citypopulation.de/Indonesia-MU.html</ref> the island is home to most of Indonesia's small [[Hindu]] minority. In the 2000 census about 92.29% of Bali's population adhered to [[Hinduism_in_Indonesia#Hinduism_in_Bali|Balinese Hinduism]] while most of the remainder follow Islam. It is also the largest tourist destination in the country and is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, [[metalworking]], and [[Balinese music|music]]. Bali, a tourist haven for decades, has seen a further surge in tourist numbers in recent years.

== History ==
{{main|History of Bali}}

Bali was inhabited by about 2000 BC by [[Austronesian peoples]] who migrated originally from [[Taiwan]] through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].<ref>Taylor (2003), pp. 5, 7; Hinzler (1995)</ref> Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are thus closely related to the peoples of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Oceania.<ref>Hinzler (1995)</ref> Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.<ref>Taylor (2003), p. 12; Lonely Planet (1999), p. 15.</ref>

In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Waisnawa, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/28/the-birthplace-balinese-hinduism.html</ref>

Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly [[Hindu]] culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name ''Bali dwipa'' ("Bali island") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning "Walidwipa". It was during this time that the complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' was developed to grow rice. Some religious and cultural traditions still in existence today can be traced back to this period. The Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293<U+2013>1520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese [[colony]] in 1343. When the empire declined, there was an exodus of intellectuals, artists, priests, and musicians from Java to Bali in the 15th century.

[[File:Tanah Lot.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Tanah Lot]], one of the major [[temples]] in Bali]]

The first [[European ethnic groups|European]] contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1585 when a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship foundered off the [[Bukit Peninsula]] and left a few Portuguese in the service of [[Dewa Agung]].<ref>Willard A. Hanna (2004). Bali Chronicles. Periplus, Singapore. ISBN 0-7946-0272-X p.32</ref> In 1597 the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Cornelis de Houtman]] arrived at Bali and, with the establishment of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1602, the stage was set for colonial control two and a half centuries later when Dutch control expanded across the Indonesian archipelago throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various distrustful Balinese realms against each other.<ref name="ctpqur">Vickers (1995)</ref> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.

The Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who fought against the superior Dutch force in a suicidal ''[[puputan]]'' defensive assault rather than face the humiliation of surrender.<ref name="ctpqur" /> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 1,000 Balinese marched to their death against the invaders.<ref>Haer, p.38</ref> In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)]], a similar massacre occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterwards the Dutch governors were able to exercise administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].

In the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], and artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] created a western image of Bali as "an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature", and western tourism first developed on the island.<ref>Friend, Theodore "Indonesian destinies" Harvard University Press, 2003 ISBN 0-674-01137-6, 9780674011373 Length 628 pages P111</ref>

[[File:Balinese dancers.jpg|thumb|upright|Balinese dancers show for tourists, [[Ubud]].]]

[[Imperial Japan]] occupied Bali during [[World War II]]. Bali Island was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer. The island was quickly captured.<ref>{{cite web|first = Klemen | last = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bali.html |title= The capture of Bali Island, February 1942 |date=1999-2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref>

During the Japanese occupation a Balinese military officer, [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai|Gusti Ngurah Rai]], formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The lack of institutional changes from the time of Dutch rule however, and the harshness of war requisitions made Japanese rule little better than the Dutch one.<ref>Haer, p.39-40</ref> Following Japan's Pacific surrender in August 1945, the Dutch promptly returned to Indonesia, including Bali, immediately to reinstate their pre-war colonial administration. This was resisted by the Balinese rebels now using Japanese weapons. On 20 November 1946, the [[Battle of Marga]] was fought in Tabanan in central Bali. Colonel I Gusti Ngurah Rai, by then 29 years old, finally rallied his forces in east Bali at Marga Rana, where they made a [[suicide attack]] on the heavily armed Dutch. The Balinese battalion was entirely wiped out, breaking the last thread of Balinese military resistance. In 1946 the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]]. Bali was included in the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949.

The 1963 eruption of [[Mount Agung]] killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be [[Transmigration program|''transmigrated'']] to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[caste system]], and those rejecting these traditional values. Politically, this was represented by opposing supporters of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) and the [[Indonesian Nationalist Party]] (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs.<ref name="ctpqur" /> [[30 September Movement|An attempted coup]] in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto. The army became the dominant power as it instigated [[Indonesian killings of 1965<U+2013>66|a violent anti-communist purge]], in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 111; Ricklefs (1991), p. 289; Vickers (1995)</ref> With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.<ref>Ricklefs, p. 289.</ref>

As a result of the 1965/66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno [[Transition to the New Order|out of the presidency]], and his [[New Order (Indonesia)|"New Order"]] government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as "paradise" was revived in a modern form, and the resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.<ref name="ctpqur" /> [[2002 Bali bombings|A bombing in 2002]] by militant [[Islamist]]s in the tourist area of [[Kuta]] killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and [[2005 Bali bombings|another in 2005]], severely affected tourism, bringing much economic hardship to the island, although tourist numbers have now returned to levels before the bombings.

== Geography ==
{{See also|List of bodies of water in Bali|List of mountains in Bali}}
[[File:Bali Labeled.png|thumb|Topography of the island]]

The island of Bali lies 3.2&nbsp;km (2&nbsp;mi) east of [[Java (island)|Java]], and is approximately [[8th parallel south|8 degrees south]] of the [[equator]]. Bali and Java are separated by the [[Bali Strait]]. East to west, the island is approximately 153&nbsp;km (95&nbsp;mi) wide and spans approximately 112&nbsp;km (69&nbsp;mi) north to south; its land area is 5,632&nbsp;km<U+00B2>.

Bali's central mountains include several peaks over 3,000 metres in elevation. The highest is [[Mount Agung]] (3,142 m), known as the "mother mountain" which is an active [[volcano]]. Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately 75&nbsp;km.

The island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]]. [[Beach]]es in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have [[black sand]]. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small ''[[sampan]]'' boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of [[Tanah Lot]], they are not yet used for significant tourism.
[[Image:Bali panorama.jpg|right|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system]]
The largest city is the provincial capital, [[Denpasar]], near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500(2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, [[Singaraja]], which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people. Other important cities include the beach resort, [[Kuta]], which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area; and [[Ubud]], which is north of Denpasar, and is known as the island's cultural centre.

Three small islands lie to the immediate south east and all are administratively part of the [[Klungkung]] regency of Bali: [[Nusa Penida]], [[Nusa Lembongan]] and [[Nusa Ceningan]]. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.

To the east, the [[Lombok Strait]] separates Bali from [[Lombok]] and marks the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] division between the fauna of the [[Indomalaya]]n [[ecozone]] and the distinctly different fauna of [[Australasia]]. The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s. When sea levels dropped during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], Bali was connected to Java and [[Sumatra]] and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands|Lesser Sunda archipelago]] isolated.

== Ecology ==
[[File:Bali Mynah - Houston Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Bali Starling]] is found only on Bali and is critically endangered.]]
Bali lies just to the west of the [[Wallace Line]], and thus has a fauna which is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok.  An exception is the [[Yellow-crested Cockatoo]], a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered [[Bali Starling]], which is [[endemism|endemic]]. Others Include [[Barn Swallow]], [[Black-naped Oriole]], [[Black Racket-tailed Treepie]], [[Crested Serpent-eagle]], [[Crested Treeswift]], [[Dollarbird]], [[Java Sparrow]], [[Lesser Adjutant]], [[Long-tailed Shrike]], [[Milky Stork]], [[Pacific Swallow]], [[Red-rumped Swallow]], [[Sacred Kingfisher]], [[Sea eagle (bird)|Sea Eagle]], [[Woodswallow]], [[Savanna Nightjar]], [[Stork-billed Kingfisher]], [[Yellow-vented Bulbul]], [[White Heron]], [[Great Egret]].

Until the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild [[Banteng]], [[Leopard]] and an endemic [[subspecies]] of Tiger, the [[Bali Tiger]]. The Banteng still occurs in its domestic form, while leopards are found only in neighboring Java, and the Bali Tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a Tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.<ref>IUCN, [http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/41682/0 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] accessed 24 June 2010</ref> The relatively small size of the island, conflict with humans, poaching and habitat reduction drove the Tiger to extinction. This was the smallest and rarest of all Tiger subspecies and was never caught on film or displayed in zoos, while few skins or bones remain in museums around the world. Today, the largest mammals are the [[Javan Rusa]] deer and the [[Wild Boar]].  A second, smaller species of deer, the [[Indian Muntjac]], also occurs.

[[File:Monkey Forest, Ubud 200507-1.jpg|thumb|Monkey Forest, [[Ubud]]]]

[[Squirrel]]s are quite commonly encountered, less often the [[Asian Palm Civet]], which is also kept in coffee farms to produce [[Kopi Luwak]]. [[Bat]]s are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction.  They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of [[Old World monkey|monkey]] occur.  The [[Crab-eating Macaque]], known locally as <U+201C>kera<U+201D>, is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three <U+201C>monkey forest<U+201D> temples, such as the popular one in the [[Ubud]] area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands, such as Bali which is far rarer and more elusive is the [[Javan Langur or the Black-leaf Monkey]],  locally known as "lutung". They occur in few places apart from the [[Bali Barat National Park]]. What is interesting about this species is that the young are born an orange colour, though by their first year they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration. In Java however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and so you can see a miixture of black and orange monkeys together as a family. In Other, rarer mammals include the [[Leopard Cat]], [[Sunda Pangolin]] and [[Black Giant Squirrel]].

Snakes include the [[King Cobra]] and [[Reticulated Python]]. The [[Water Monitor]] can grow to an impressive size and move surprisingly quickly.

The rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as [[Tulamben]], [[Amed (Bali)|Amed]], Menjangan or neighboring [[Nusa Penida]], host a wide range of marine life, for instance [[Hawksbill Turtle]], [[Mola mola|Giant Sunfish]], [[Manta ray|Giant Manta Ray]], [[Giant moray|Giant Moray Eel]], [[Bumphead Parrotfish]], [[Hammerhead Shark]], [[Grey reef shark|Reef Shark]], [[barracuda]], and [[sea snake]]s. [[Dolphin]]s are commonly encountered on the north coast near [[Singaraja]] and [[Lovina]].

Many plants have been introduced by humans within the last centuries, particularly since the 20th century, making it sometimes hard to distinguish what plants are really native. Among the larger trees the most common are: [[Banyan]] trees, [[Jackfruit]], [[coconut]]s, [[bamboo]] species, [[acacia]] trees and also endless rows of [[coconut]]s and [[banana]] species. Numerous flowers can be seen: [[hibiscus]], [[frangipani]], [[bougainvillea]], [[poinsettia]], [[oleander]], [[jasmine]], [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]], [[Nelumbo|lotus]], [[rose]]s, [[begonia]]s, orchids and [[hydrangea]]s exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around [[Kintamani, Bali|Kintamani]], certain species of [[fern]] trees, [[mushroom]]s and even [[pine]] trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: [[salak]], [[mangosteen]], [[Maize|corn]], Kintamani [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[coffee]] and [[water spinach]].

A team of scientists has conducted survey from April 29, 2011 to May 11, 2011 at 33 sea site of Bali. They have discovered 952 species of reef fish which 8 of them were new discoveries at [[Pemuteran]], [[Gilimanuk]], [[Nusa Dua]], [[Tulamben]] and [[Candidasa]] and 393 coral species, including two new ones at [[Padangbai]] and between Padangbai and [[Amed]].<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/13/new-fish-coral-species-found.html</ref>
The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36 percent (better than in [[Raja Ampat]] and [[Halmahera]] by 29 percent or in [[Fakfak]] and [[Kaimana]] by 25 percent) with the highest coverage was found in [[Gili Selang]] and [[Gili Mimpang]] in [[Candidasa]], [[Karangasem]] regency.<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/16/coral-reefs<U+2019>-health-<U+2018>improves<U+2019>.html</ref>

==Environment==
Some of the worst erosion has occurred in [[Lebih Beach]], where up to 7 meters of land is lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to [[Masceti Beach]].<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/05/once-was-a-beach.html</ref>

From ranked third in previous review, in 2010 Bali got score 99.65 of Indonesia's environmental quality index and the highest of all the 33 provinces. The score measured 3 water quality parameters: the level of [[total suspended solids]] (TSS), [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD).<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/15/bali-named-ri<U+2019>s-cleanest-province.html</ref>

Due to over-exploitation by the tourist industry which converse massive land, 200 out of 400 rivers on the island have dried up and based on research, the southern part of bali would face a water shortage up to 2,500 liters of clean water per second by 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/02/bali-must-stop-over-exploiting-environment-tourism-activists.html |title=Bali must stop over- exploiting environment for tourism: Activists |date=September 2, 2011}}</ref>
To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 liters capacity of water per second will be channeled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/17/govt-build-water-catchment-petanu-river.html |title=Govt to build water catchment at Petanu River |date=September 17, 2011}}</ref>

== Administrative divisions ==
The province is divided into 8 [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') and 1 [[Cities of Indonesia|city]] (''kota''). These are:

== Economy ==
Three decades ago, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment. Tourism is now the largest single industry; and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia<U+2019>s wealthiest regions. About 80% of Bali's economy depends on tourism.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,393799,00.html Desperately Seeking Survival]. Time. 25 November 2002.</ref> By end of June 2011, [[non-performing loan]] of all banks in Bali were 2.23 percent average, relatively quite low compare to about 5 percent average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan.<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/25/only-223-percent-loans-bali-are-bad.html</ref> The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the terrorist bombings [[2002 Bali bombing|2002]] and [[2005 Bali bombing|2005]]. The tourism industry is slowly recovering once again.

=== Agriculture ===

Bali is also famous for its [[artisan]]s who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including [[batik]] and [[ikat]] cloth and clothing, [[Woodworking|wooden carvings]], stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.

The Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near [[Mount Batur]]. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavors include lemon and other citrus notes.<ref name="SCAI">{{cite web| url=http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/|title=Diverse coffees of Indonesia|work=Specialty Coffee Association of Indonesia|accessdate=8 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802030333/http://www.sca-indo.org/diverse-coffees-indonesia/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2 August 2008}}</ref> Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the [[Hindu]] philosophy of "Tri Hita Karana<U+201D>.

=== Tourism ===

The tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while significant in the other parts of the island as well. The main tourist locations are the town of [[Kuta]] (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and [[Seminyak]] (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] (once the only tourist hub), in the center of the island [[Ubud]], to the south of the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]], [[Jimbaran]], and the newer development of [[Nusa Dua]] and [[Pecatu]].

The American government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. As of 2009, the Australian government still rates it at a 4 danger level (the same as several countries in [[central Africa]]) on a scale of 5.

An offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5 star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Million dollar villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic (many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active) investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.

In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors value for their currencies. Visitor arrivals for 2009 were forecast to drop 8% (which would be higher than 2007 levels), due to the worldwide economic crisis which has also affected the global tourist industry, but not due to any travel warnings.

Bali's tourism economy survived the terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has in fact slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. At 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists. It is surpassed the target of 2.0-2.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65 percent (last year 60.8 percent), so still capable for accommodates tourists for next some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels,<ref>http://www.thebalitimes.com/2011/02/17/up-to-2-8m-foreign-tourists-this-year/</ref> although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.

Bali received the Best Island award from [[Travel and Leisure]] in 2010. The award was presented in the show "World's Best Awards 2010" in New York, on 21 July. Hotel Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran also received an award in the category of "World Best Hotel Spas in Asia 2010". The award was based on a survey of travel magazine [[Travel + Leisure]] readers between 15 December 2009 through 31 March 2010, and was judged on several criteria. Thermes Marins Bali, Ayana Resort and Spa, (formerly The Ritz-Carlton) got score 95.6 scored out of a maximum 100 of satisfaction index with spa facilities and services as #1 Spa in the world by Conde Naste's Traveller Magazine for 2010 by their readers poll.<ref>http://amarigepanache.com/2010/10/16/travel-all-we-want-for-christmas-a-spa-voucher/</ref> The island of Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, rank in second after [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://beatmag.com/daily/latest-news/bali-named-as-one-of-the-five-best-islands-in-the-world.html |title=Bali Named as One of the Five Best Islands in the World |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}</ref>

On August 2010, the film version of [[Eat, Pray, Love]] (EPL), which starred [[Julia Roberts]], was released in theaters. The movie was based on [[Elizabeth Gilbert]]'s best-selling memoir of the same name. It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach at Bali. The 2006 book, which spent 57 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the New York Times paperback nonfiction best-seller list, has already fueled a boom in EPL tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist center that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance through traditional spirituality and healing that leads to love.<ref>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/LH18Ae01.html</ref> Newly launched packages by luxury resorts and spas like Ubud Hanging Gardens and the cliff-top Ayana promise to recreate Gilbert's four transformative months on Bali in a few passing days with yoga classes, drawn-out beach dinners, massage therapy.

== Transportation ==
[[File:Bali moped col.jpg|thumb|A major form of transport in Bali is the [[Moped]]]]
The [[Ngurah Rai Airport|Ngurah Rai International Airport]] is located near Jimbaran, on the [[isthmus]] at the southernmost part of the island. [[Lt.Col. Wisnu Airfield]] is found in north-west Bali.

A coastal road surrounds the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching to 1,750m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar and enables cars to travel quickly in the heavily populated south. Bali has no railway lines yet.

On May 2011, an integrated Areal Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at 4 crossing points, i.e.: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all traffic lights, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other ASEAN countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.<ref>http://www.mediaindonesia.com/read/2011/05/12/225490/290/101/Pemprov-Bali-Gunakan-Teknologi-Baru-Atasi-Kemacetan</ref><ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/25/new-traffic-control-system-buses-hoped-ease-congestion.html</ref>

== Demographics ==
The population of Bali was 3,891,428 (at the 2010 Census). There are an estimated 30,000 expatriates living in Bali.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/30/barack-obama-absentee-voting-bali Ballots in paradise]. Guardian.co.uk. 30 October 2008.</ref>

=== Religion ===
[[File:Mother Temple of Besakih.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mother Temple of Besakih]], one of Bali's most significant [[Hindu]] temples.]]
[[File:Ubud Cremation Procession 1.jpg|thumb|right|A religious procession]]

Unlike most of [[Islam|Muslim]]-majority Indonesia, about 93.18% of Bali's population adheres to [[Balinese Hinduism]] Hindu Dharma, formed as a combination of existing [[Balinese mythology|local beliefs]] and [[Hindu]] influences from mainland [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. Minority religions include [[Islam]] (4.79%), [[Christianity]] (1.38%), and [[Buddhism]] (0.64%). These figures do not include immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.

When Islam surpassed Hinduism in [[Java]] (16th century), Bali became a refuge for many Hindus. Balinese Hinduism is an amalgam in which gods and demigods are worshipped together with Buddhist heroes, the spirits of ancestors, indigenous agricultural deities and sacred places. Religion as it is practiced in Bali is a composite belief system that embraces not only theology, philosophy, and mythology, but ancestor worship, animism and magic. It pervades nearly every aspect of traditional life. [[Caste]] is observed, though less strictly than in India. With an estimated 20,000 [[Pura (Balinese temple)|puras (temples)]] and shrines, Bali is known as the "Island of a Thousand Puras", or "Island of the Gods".<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/bali/everyday-spirits/2008/05/01/1209235036507.html Everyday spirits]. Theage.com.au. 3 May 2008.</ref>

Balinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and in Buddhism, and adopted the animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualizing states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behavior.<ref>Slattum, J. (2003) ''Balinese Masks: Spirits of an Ancient Drama. Indonesia, Asia Pacific, Japan, North America, Latin America and Europe'' Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd</ref>

Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonize it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''odalan''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>[http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html Blogspot.com]</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>[http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html Blogspot.com]</ref>

=== Language ===
[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Sanskrit]] is also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, for Hinduism literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.

[[English language|English]] is a common third language (and the primary foreign language) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]]. Other foreign languages, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.

== Culture ==

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De beroemde Balinese danser I Mario TMnr 10004713.jpg|thumb|The famous dancer I Mario, picture taken 1940.]]
Bali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous Balinese dances include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.<ref>{{cite book|title=Masked Performance: The Play of Self and Other in Ritual and Theatre|last=Emigh|first=John|authorlink=John Emigh|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=081221336X}} The author is a Western theatre professor who has become a performer in Balinese [[topeng]] theater himself.</ref>

The Hindu New Year, ''[[Nyepi]]'', is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged to remain in their hotels. But the day before that large, colourful sculptures of ''ogoh-ogoh'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portert van twee jonge Balinese danseressen TMnr 10004678b.jpg|thumb|Balinese dancers wearing elaborate headgear, photographed in 1929. Digitally restored.]]

Celebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d<U+00E9>sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref>Herbst 1997, p. 1-2.</ref> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref>Foley and Sedana 2005, p. 208.</ref> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram<U+00E9>'', is distinctively Balinese. Oftentimes two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other in order to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram<U+00E9>''.<ref>Gold 2005, p. 8.</ref>

[[File:Balinese Stone Carvings.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings in Ubud.]]

''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island<U+2019>s largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref>Herbst 1997, p. 1-2.; Gold 2005, p. 19.</ref>

Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardized in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists in order to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>Gold 2005, p. 18-26.</ref>

Tourism, Bali<U+2019>s chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' dance have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref>Sanger 1988, p. 90-93.</ref>

Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including "[[kasepekang]]", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratization and decentralization of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name="NYT" />
