==History==
===Open Beta===
After releasing two mini-games as teasers to the full-feature Ultimate Baseball Online, [[open beta]] testing sign-ups were announced on [[March 2nd]], [[2004]]. The game allowed a revolution in gaming technology in which baseball enthusiasts and gamers were able to actually compete in real-time in a 3D [[virtual]] stadium. The version included league play, pick-up games and practice mode. The release of the full game was expected to be around Fall 2004; however, those plans fell through.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/07_28_04_02_12PM.htm|title=World<U+2019>s First Online Virtual Reality Baseball Experience to be Launched Fall 2004 by Netamin Corporation|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2004]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

===ESPN Spring Training===
On April 27th, 2005, [[Netamin Communication Corporation]] and [[ESPN]] announced a partnership to produce [[ESPN]] [[Spring Training]] and Ultimate Baseball Online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/Press4_27.asp|title=ESPN and Netamin Join Forces|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>
[[ESPN]] Spring Training was officially released on May 11th, 2005. [[ESPN]] Spring Training was meant to be played offline as practice in preparation for the main game, Ultimate Baseball Online. Participants of [[ESPN]] Spring Training were able to see and compare their hitting averages and status on the [[ESPN]] Leaderboard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press5_11.asp|title=ESPN SPRING TRAINING 101|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

===ESPN UBO===
The full-feature version of [[ESPN]] Ultimate Baseball Online (ESPN UBO) was released on [[ESPN360]] on [[May 12th]], [[2005]]. Fans with broadband capability were able to download the world's first massive multi-player online sports game from [[ESPN.com]]. Among the enhancements included in the new version are enhanced graphics, new [[pitching]] and [[fielding]] practice, enhanced crowd reactions, and better artificial fielding intelligence. The beta version of ESPN UBO features a new [[graphics engine]] that runs at 60 frames per second and more than 100,000 polygons per frame - double the quantity of the previous version. Other visual enhancements include dynamic RGB lighting, soft-edged shadows, and natural reflections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/05_12_05_12_54PM.htm|title=ULTIMATE BASEBALL ONLINE BETA RELEASED ON ESPN360 AND ESPN.COM|work=ESPN360|publisher=[[ESPN360]]|author=ESPN360|date=[[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

===UBO 2006===
Returning to independent development, the release version of UBO 2006 brought completely automated tournament game play. It featured tournament record keeping and tournament-specific Leader Board statistics, extending player information beyond the previous edition's pick up game statistics and Leader Board statistics. Tournament statistics were posted to the UBO Website in real time so players can track their own and their teammates' statistics and scout out the performance of opposing players during the course of the tournament. Significant player achievements are also posted to personal character Web pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press2_15.asp|title=<U+201C>Ultimate Baseball Online 2006<U+201D> Announced for the PC|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

On [[September 25th]], [[2006]], [[Netamin Communication Corporation]] announced the adoption of a [[pay-to-play]] monthly subscription model for its game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press_kitintro06.asp|title=Ultimate Baseball Online Subscription Begins|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> The plan was scrapped shortly before the new subscription model came into effect. It was announced that Netamin will instead adopt an [[free-to-play]] [[in-game advertising]] model instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press_free.asp|title=Ultimate Baseball Online 2006 to Remain Free for All Players|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

===UBO 2007===
Featuring new mini-games and a power ranking system, Ultimate Baseball Online 2007 was rolled out on [[March 1st]], [[2007]]. In addition to mini-games, [[Free Agent]] Tournaments were also added, allowing for tournament play outside of the team structure, and extending the opportunity for gamers to meet other players. 

UBO 2007 included the awarding of Power Ranking Points for teams, based on their performance in a wide variety of UBO leagues and tournaments. Points were accumulated throughout the year, with the top 64 UBO teams earning a berth in competition dubbed "The Best of UBO 2007". The global event features $10,000 [[USD]] in cash prizes and will run from November 26, 2007, to December 21, 2007.

UBO 2007 also featured a number of graphical upgrades and changes, including new effects and real-world advertisers in the stadiums, courtesy of a partnership with [[in-game advertising]] company [[Double Fusion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press_marlaunch_07.asp|title=Spring Is In the Air.

==Gameplay Elements==
[[Image:MyUBO.jpg|225px|MyUBO|thumbnail|right]]
===MyUBO===
'''MyUBO''', introduced in November 2006, gives personalized information to each player upon game entry in order to keep them informed and educated about the possibilities of event participation and community networking. The informational hub is dedicated to keeping each UBO gamer up to date on all things UBO that pertain to his or her characters. MyUBO includes:
*'''MyEvents''' - which highlights events including team activities and tournament schedules that are either available to or assigned to each character
*'''MyCharacters''' - which displays the game statistics for each player's characters, and the Experience Points each character needs to "level up"
*'''MyNews''' - which displays UBO-wide news updates as well as personalized messages dedicated solely to the individual character. 
The MyUBO portal also serves as the launch point of the Ultimate Baseball Online client.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press_myubo.asp|title=Ultimate Baseball Online Adds "MyUBO" for PC game players|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>
===Virtual Trophy Case===
Players can earn a variety of virtual trophies based on the accomplishments of their online game baseball characters. The trophy case gives additional visibility to prestige awards, such as UBO ''Player of Month'', which is selected by the entire UBO community. UBO baseball characters will automatically earn trophies for batting accomplishments, such as hitting 10 [[home runs]], and [[pitching]] feats, such as throwing 100 [[strikeouts]]. A third category is for awarded trophies, such as recognition for league play or [[MVP]] selection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press_trophies.asp|title=Ultimate Baseball Online Adds Virtual Trophy Case|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>
===UBO Patcher===
The Ultimate Baseball Online Patcher updates each individuals game to the latest version. The patcher is also used to configure graphics and test connection issues. Ultimate Baseball Online allows 800x600, 1024x768, and 1280x1024 screen resolutions; normal or high textures; or window mode.
===Servers===
Ultimate Baseball Online is divided into two main [[servers]], with other servers serving other purposes. The Rookie Clubhouse is designed for new players levels 1-9 while the Pickup Clubhouse is designed for players level 9-99. Other servers include the Practice Clubhouse, specifically used for practices, and Tournament Clubhouses, for special events.

All UBO Servers are located in [[Diamond Bar, CA]].
===Character Creation===
Players can create and customize their [[avatar]] as a unique baseball character, selecting their baseball position for playing and viewing all game play from the unique perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatebaseballonline.com/Community/CharacterDevelopment.asp|title=Character Development|work=Ultimate Baseball Online|publisher=Ultimate Baseball Online|author=Ultimate Baseball Online|date=[[2007]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>
Some of the many avatar customization options that Ultimate Baseball Online offers are:
*Primary position
*Gender
*Faces
*Throwing Arm Angle
*Throwing Arm Side
*Batting Side
*Batting Style
===Pitching===
Ultimate Baseball Online offers a dynamic pitching system, featuring 12 pitches and varying speeds. Pitching is affected by the Arm Strength and Throwing Accuracy statistics. The twelve pitches available in-game are:
*[[Fastball]]
*[[Changeup|Change Up]]
*[[Cut fastball|Cut Fastball]]
*[[Two-seam fastball|Two-Seam Fastball]]
*[[Rising fastball|Rising Fastball]]
*[[Slider]]
*[[Curveball|Curve Ball]]
*[[Screwball|Screw Ball]]
*[[Sinker]]
*[[Forkball|Fork Ball]]
*[[Splitter]]
*[[Knuckleball|Knuckle Ball]]
===Batting===
Hitters control everything in the hitting mode from swing power to hit location. Just like in real life, timing and accuracy is everything. Players can determine what type of swing they want (from bunt to all types of contact levels). Based on the speed of the pitch and reaction time to start the swing, a player can hit a [[Home Run]] out of the park or miss on a breaking ball low and away.
===Fielding===
Running, catching, throwing; all in the same play. Fielders must complete plays, make the outs, and prevent runs from scoring, much like in real life baseball. Players are not limited to their positions, as players can choose positions prior to the start of each game as well as during each game. From outfield to infield to foul ground, players can make plays just like real baseball players do, as well as dive and jump for the ball. In the event a full game is not reached, the AI takes the field and plays the position.
===Stadiums===
The original Ultimate Baseball Online Stadium includes a jumbotron, billboards, stands, and normal features of a baseball stadium. One unique feature of the UBO Stadium is the outfield waterfalls. The stadium bares a striking resemblance to [[Kauffman Stadium]], the home of the [[Kansas City Royals]].

==Tournaments==
Tournaments are designed to provide quick and intense competition between teams and individuals. Most tournaments are free and hosted weekly by Ultimate Baseball Online's development team. Any team, pending if requirements are met, can join tournaments and compete against each other at the specified time of the tournament. Entire tournaments may last several days, pending on how many teams are entered.

UBO pay-to-play tournaments costs an small entry fee, but the winners take home valuable prizes. There have been three prize tournaments featuring the [[Apple]] [[iPod mini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/07_19_05_11_37AM.htm|title=Online Gamers Win Apple iPod Mini's During Free "Ultimate Baseball Online" Beta Tournament|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Sunglasses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press8_5.asp|title=Tournament Prizes Announced for Double-Up Tournament"|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>, and [[Sony PSP]]'s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netamin.com/press_psp06.asp|title=Netamin Announces First "Ultimate Baseball Online 2006" Pay-To-Play Tournament|work=Netamin PR|publisher=[[Netamin Communication Corporation]]|author=Netamin|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>.
