The '''Rio de Janeiro cableway''' ({{lang-pt|Bondinho do P<U+00E3>o de A<U+00E7><U+00FA>car}}) is a [[cableway]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. Moving between [[Praia Vermelha]] and the [[Sugarloaf Mountain]], it stops at [[Morro da Urca]] (at {{convert|722|ft}}) on its way up and down, and reaches the summit of the {{convert|1299|ft}} mountain. 

The cableway was envisioned by the engineer [[Augusto Ferreira Ramos]] in 1908 who sought support from well-known figures of Rio's high society to promote its construction. Opened in 1912, it was only the third cableway to be built in the world. In 1972 the cars were updated, growing from a capacity of 22 to 75, and in 1979 it featured in an action scene for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.  Today it is used by approximately 2,500 visitors every day. The cable cars run every 30 minutes, between 8 am and 10 pm.

The development of technical and engineering achievement of the National Exhibition in Commemoration of the First Centenary of the Opening of the Ports of Brazil to the International Trade in 1908 motivated engineer Augusto Ramos to idealize a cable car system in Rio de Janeiro. Ramos had to resort to well-known figures of Rio's high society, such as [[Eduardo Guinles]] and [[Raymundo Ottoni de Castro Maya]], who were powerful figures with a range of developmental interests in the city at the time,<ref>{{cite book|title=Bondinho do P<U+00E3>o de A<U+00E7><U+00FA>car: 95 anos da Companhia Caminho A<U+00E9>reo P<U+00E3>o de A<U+00E7><U+00FA>car|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DRATAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Andrea Jakobsson Est<U+00FA>dio|language=Portuguese|page=44}}</ref> to promote the idea of an electric cable system. When the cable car was built, there were only two others in the world: the chairlift at [[Monte Ulia]], in Spain, with a length of {{convert|280|m}}, built in 1907,<ref>{{cite book|title=Revista do Instituto Hist<U+00F3>rico e Geogr<U+00E1>fico Brasileiro|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iI8YAAAAYAAJ|year=1988|language=Portuguese|page=537}}</ref> and the lift at [[Wetterhorn]], in Switzerland, with a length of {{convert|560|m}}, built in 1908.<ref>{{cite book|title=Engineering Abstracts from the Current Periodical Literature of Engineering and Applied Science, Published Outside the United Kingdom|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a_4RAQAAMAAJ|year=1928|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain)|page=142}}</ref> 

The Rio de Janeiro cableway was opened on 27 October 1912.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bondinho do P<U+00E3>o de A<U+00E7><U+00FA>car: 95 anos da Companhia Caminho A<U+00E9>reo P<U+00E3>o de A<U+00E7><U+00FA>car|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DRATAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Andrea Jakobsson Est<U+00FA>dio|language=Portuguese|page=47}}</ref><ref name="Farias2006">{{cite book|last=Farias|first=Edson|title=O desfile e a cidade: o carnaval-espet<U+00E1>culo carioca|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Revaqzh-CqUC&pg=PA210|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Editora E-papers|language=Portuguese|isbn=978-85-7650-057-5|page=210}}</ref> Its Portuguese-language name comes from the similarities between the cablecars, and the [[trams of Rio de Janeiro|former trams]] in town.

The first cable cars were coated wood and were used for 60 years. Originally, the cable car stopped at Urca. In 1951, an accident occurred in which one of the two cables snapped, leaving 22 people dangling on one cable. One mechanic aboard, Augusto Goncales, climbed out and slithered down to Urca station and helped to build an emergency car to go back up and rescue the other passengers, 12 women and girls, 6 men and 3 children, in an event which took about 10 hours.<ref name="Inc1951">{{cite book|title=LIFE|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x0sEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA51|date=12 March 1951|publisher=Time Inc|page=51|id={{ISSN|00243019}}}}</ref> [[President Vargas]] praised Goncales as the "Hero of the Day".<ref name="Inc1951"/>
In October 1972, a second cable was added, as well as new cabins, which expanded its capacity from 22 to 75;<ref>{{cite book|title=Manchete|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y5IwAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Block Editores|language=Portuguese|page=28}}</ref> eventually, it was reduced to 65 to increase comfort.<ref name="Folha">{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/cotidiano/74473-bondinho-100.shtml|title=Bondinho, 100|publisher=Folha.uol.com.br|accessdate=15 August 2014|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Prominent users of the service have included [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], [[Lech Walesa]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Pope John Paul II]], and [[Brooke Shields]].{{citation required}} 

The cable car was the setting for the 1979 James Bond film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' in which British secret agent James Bond (played by actor [[Roger Moore]]) battles with his nemesis [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] ([[Richard Kiel]]) in the middle of the tramway, which eventually results in a tramcar with Jaws in it crashing into the ground station and smashing through the wall, although he miraculously survives. During the filming, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of [[liquorice]], although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.<ref>''Moonraker Special Edition'', Region 2 booklet. 2000.</ref> Also in 1979, [[Las Vegas]]-based [[Steven McPeak]] [[Tightrope walking|walked the tightrope]] on the steel cable, the highest stretch of the cable car route, a feat which entered him into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref name="McWhirter1985">{{cite book|last=McWhirter|first=Norris|title=Guinness Book of World Records 1985|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1MNPAAAAYAAJ|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-8069-0264-7|page=326}}</ref><ref name="McFarlanMcWhirter1988">{{cite book|last1=McFarlan|first1=Donald|last2=McWhirter|first2=Norris|title=Guinness book of world records|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lPb45rGVTDEC|year=1988|publisher=Bantam|isbn=978-0-553-27926-9|page=485}}</ref> On 18 January 1983, the route was expanded to Sugarloaf Mountain.
