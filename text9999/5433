In electronics, '''TO-5''' is a designation for a standardized metal [[semiconductor package]] used for transistors and some integrated circuits. The ''TO'' element stands for "transistor outline" and refers to a series of technical drawings produced by [[JEDEC]].

==Construction==

The typical TO-5 package has a base diameter of 8.9mm, a cap diameter of 8.1mm, and a cap height of 6.3mm. Different manufacturers have different tolerances, and the actual form factor may vary slightly, depending on function.

The tab on the metal can usually marks the last pin-number, for example 8 on a typical [[operational amplifier]] and the pin numbers count upwards counter clock-wise.
