The [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) defeated the Tibetan army in a war at [[Chamdo]] on [[October 7]] 1950. This attack marked the beginning of [[Beijing]]<U+2019>s campaign to incorporate [[Tibet]] into [[People's Republic of China]].

== Timeline ==

According to [[Samdhong Rinpoche]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]], on [[January 1]] 1950 the PRC promised to "liberate" Tibet. The People's Liberation Army first entered eastern Tibet ([[Chamdo]]) on [[October 7]] 1950.<ref name = "Laird"/> The highly mobile units of the PLA quickly surrounded the outnumbered Tibetan forces, and by [[October 19]] 1950, 5,000 Tibetan troops had surrendered.<ref name = "Laird"/> After confiscating their weapons, the PLA soldiers gave their prisoners lectures on socialism, and a small amount of money, and allowed them to return to their homes.<ref name = "Laird"/>

The PLA then continued on to central Tibet, but halted its advance 200km to the east of [[Lhasa]], at what China claimed was the ''de jure'' boundary of Tibet<ref>Li T.T., "Historical Status of Tibet"(New York, Columbia University Press, 1956) saying: "''Chamdo is in Kham and outside of Tibet proper. The Chinese Communist army, though it had captured Chamdo, which was considered a part of Sikang, could not be said to have entered Tibet proper''"</ref><ref name="Rin">[[Samdhong Rinpoche|Rinpoche, Samdhong]].

ISBN 1933316209. pg 116-117</ref>, where they stopped and demanded Tibet's "peaceful liberation."<ref name = "Laird"/>

The PLA, while possessing overwhelming military advantage, was also set on winning the hearts and minds of the Tibetan populace.<ref name = "Laird"/> At first, they treated the local populace very well, building roads, and paying locals for their labor.<ref name = "Laird"/> According to [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the current Dalai Lama, the PLA did not attack civilians: "The Chinese were very disciplined. They were like the British soldiers (in 1904). Even better than the British, because they distributed some money (to villagers and local leaders). So they carefully planned."<ref name = "Laird"/>

The PLA sent released prisoners (among them [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme]], a captured governor) to Lhasa to negotiate with the Dalai Lama on the PLA's behalf.<ref name = "Laird"/> The PLA promised that if Tibet was "peacefully liberated", the Tibetan elites would keep their privileges and power. At the same time, Jigme and other released captives testified to their good treatment by the PLA.<ref name = "Laird"/> As the PLA had stopped and was asking for peaceful negotiations instead of entering Lhasa unimpeded, the United Nations unanimously dropped the issue from the agenda.<ref name = "Laird"/> The combination of military pressure, reports of good treatment from locals and released prisoners, and the lack of international support convinced the Tibetan representatives to enter negotiations with the PLA.<ref name = "Laird"/>

Several months later, in May [[1951]], the Tibetan representatives signed a [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|seventeen-point agreement]] in Beijing with the PRC's [[Central People's Government]] affirming China's sovereignty over Tibet. The agreement was ratified in [[Lhasa]] a few months later.<ref>Gyatso, Tenzin, Dalai Lama XIV, interview, [[25 July]] 1981.</ref><ref name=goldstein/> Point 15 of the agreement stated that the Chinese government would set up a military and administrative committee and a military area headquarters in Tibet. PLA troops entered Lhasa peacefully in the fall of 1951.<ref name=goldstein/> An article releasd by the Tibetan Government in Exile in 1996 states that the treaty was imposed on Tibet by force and it "was never validly concluded and was rejected by Tibetans"<ref>[http://www.tibet.com/WhitePaper/white2.html Invasion and illegal annexation of Tibet: 1949-1951]</ref>, a position that was supported by a UK parliamentary review.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmfaff/860/86008.htm House of Commons Publications and Records, August 13, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.tibet.com/Status/statuslaw.html The Status of Tibet]</ref>

==Statistics of Casualties==
===Tibetans===
[[Samdhong Rinpoche]], the [[14th Dalai Lama]], and other [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetans in exile]] have accused the PRC government of a campaign of terror which led to the destruction of monasteries and disappearance of up to 1.2 million Tibetans. By 1962 only 70 of the original 2,500 monasteries in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] were left and 93% of the monks were forced out. The "1.2 million" figure for deaths since 1950 dates to a figure from the Tibetan Government-in-exile which they break down to 433,000 through military action, 343,000 through famine, 173,000 through imprisonment, 157,000 through execution, 93,000 through torture and 9,000 through suicide.<ref name"IL">Robert McCorquodale, Nicholas Orosz (eds.) ''The Posiion of Tibet in International Law'', Serindia Publishers.''</ref> 

The high casualty reported by the Tibetans has been questioned by western scholars. Tom Grunfeld finds that the figure is "without documentary evidence."<ref> Grunfield, Tom. ''The Making of Modern Tibet''. p247.</ref> According to Patrick French, a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations, the estimate is not reliable. The Tibetans were not able to process the data well enough to produce a credible total. French says this total was based on refugee interviews, but prevented outsider access to the data. French, who did gain access, found no names, but "the insertion of seemingly random figures into each section, and constant, unchecked duplication."<ref>Barry Sautman, June Teufel Dreyer, Contemporary Tibet: Politics, Development, And Society In A Disputed Region pp. 239</ref> Prior to 1950, population figures for Tibet, estimated by the Lhasa government and foreign visitors, generally ranged from 1 to 1.5 million. The official Tibetan census in 1953 only recorded a population of 1,273,969.<ref>See Leo A. Orleans,"A Note on Tibet's Population."</ref> 

A document allegedly sourced to the PLA claims 87,000 deaths in the 1959-60 period.<ref> Grunfield, Tom. ''The Making of Modern Tibet''. p247.</ref>

==Perspective==
===PRC perspective===
Traditionally, a portion of the population in Tibet were serfs ("''mi ser''"),<ref>Goldstein, Melvyn, ''An Anthropological Study of the Tibetan Political System'', 1968, p. 40</ref><ref>Rahul, Ram, ''The Structure of the Government of Tibet, 1644<U+2013>1911'', 1962, pp. 263<U+2013>98</ref> bound to land often owned by wealthy Tibetan [[monasteries]] and Tibetan aristocrats. This however was untrue of eastern and northeastern two-thirds of Tibet where the nomads owned their own land.<ref>Grunfeld, ''Modern Tibet'', 9.</ref> The Chinese government claims that most Tibetans were still serfs in 1951, and have proclaimed that the Tibetan government inhibited the development of Tibet during its self-rule from 1913 to 1959, and opposed any modernization efforts proposed by the Chinese government.<ref name = "Wang 194-7">Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp. 194<U+2013>7</ref>  Announcements were made via [[Radio Peking]] on October 25 to state the troops were there to "free Tibetans from imperialist oppression".<ref name="Gill">Gill, Farrer-Halls.

In July 2001 a monument was established to commermorate the event.<ref name="NC1" />  [[Beijing]] says that Tibet was under an uninterrupted series of [[Chinese government]]s that has ruled Tibet and China since [[Genghis Khan]]. In 2005 president [[Hu Jintao]] asserted Tibet has been an "inalienable part of Chinese territory" from the time of the [[Mongol]] conquest onward.  This has been taught to Chinese students since 1912.<ref name = "Laird"/>

===Other perspectives===
The UN General Assembly passed resolutions condemning China for "violations of fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people" in 1959,<ref>[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/141/76/IMG/NR014176.pdf?OpenElement UN Resolution 1353 (XIV), 21 October 1959]</ref> 1961<ref>[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/167/76/IMG/NR016776.pdf?OpenElement UN Resolution 1723 (XVI), 20 December 1961]</ref> and 1965.<ref>[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/218/42/IMG/NR021842.pdf?OpenElement UN Resolution 2079 (XX), 18 December 1965]</ref> German Federal Parliament held hearings on Tibet on [[June 19]] 1995, and passed a resolution on [[June 20]] 1996 stating they were "deeply concerned that this independent identity has been threatened by destruction since the Chinese action by brutal force of arms in 1950" and that China had deprived the Tibetans of self-determination.<ref>"Improving the Human Rights Situation in Tibet."

== Aftermath ==
The seventeen-point agreement was initially put into effect in Tibet proper. However, Eastern [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] (the provinces of [[Xikang]] and [[Qinghai]] in the Chinese administrative hierarchy) were outside the administration of the Tibetan government in Lhasa, and were thus treated like any other Chinese province with land redistribution implemented in full -- a peculiar idea given that the Khampas and nomads of Amdo traditionally owned their own land.<ref>Grunfeld, ''Modern Tibet'', 9.</ref> Unsurprisingly, resistance broke out in [[Amdo]] and eastern [[Kham]] in June 1956. 

According to John Knaus, the author of the ''Orphans of the Cold War'', by 1957, [[Kham]] was in chaos. PLA reprisals against Khampa resistance fighters became increasingly brutal and included beatings, starving prisoners, and the repeated rape of prisoners' wives in front of them until they confessed. Monks and nuns were forced to have sex with each other and forcibly renounce their celebacy vows. After torture, these men and women were often killed.<ref>John Kenneth Knaus, ''Orphans of the Cold War'', 134.</ref> Even monastic networks came to be used by guerilla forces to relay messages and hide rebels.<ref>Knaus, ''Orphans of the Cold War'', 86.</ref> According to John Roberts II, a freelance writer, by the late 1950s, the number of Tibetan freedom fighters numbered in the tens of thousands.  The resistance, supported by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) under [[Eisenhower]], eventually spread to Lhasa, which had become crowded with refugees.<ref>[http://www.takhli.org/rjw/tibet.htm Roberts, John. "Inside Story of CIA's Black Hands in Tibet." ''The American Spectator'', December 1997]</ref> 

According to John Roberts II, the "peaceful liberation" of Tibet culminated in the [[Lhasa uprising]] on March 10, 1959, when Chinese shelled a crowd of 30,000 Tibetan civilians with artillery.<ref>[http://www.takhli.org/rjw/tibet.htm Roberts, John. "Inside Story of CIA's Black Hands in Tibet." ''The American Spectator'', December 1997]</ref> The casualty was estimated in captured Chinese documents to be as many as 85,000.<ref>[http://www.takhli.org/rjw/tibet.htm Roberts, John. "Inside Story of CIA's Black Hands in Tibet." ''The American Spectator'', December 1997]</ref> During the [[Kennedy administration]] special operations Air Force planes that were ready to drop supplies and ammunition were forced to stand by, resulting in the massacre of between six and eight thousand Tibetan resistance fighters.<ref>[http://www.takhli.org/rjw/tibet.htm Roberts, John. "Inside Story of CIA's Black Hands in Tibet." ''The American Spectator'', December 1997]</ref> According to the Tibetan Government in Exile during the struggle tens of thousands of Tibetans were killed by the Chinese.<ref name="giehist">Official Website of the Tibetan Government in Exile.

"Inside Story of CIA's Black Hands in Tibet." ''The American Spectator'', December 1997]</ref>

According to [[Felix Greene]], the 1959 uprising failed to gain support from the Tibetans. <U+201C>Even western sources never estimated that more than 20,000 were involved<U+2026>this does not sound like mass support.<U+201D> <ref> China: the Country Americans Are Not Allowed to Know, page 281 </ref>  (That figure would have been nearly 2% of Tibet's population.)  UNHCR said tens of thousands of Tibetans fled. <ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.htm?tbl=RSDCOI&page=research&id=3f51f90821 The UN Human Refugee Agency]</ref>  The CIA officer, Bruce Walker, who oversaw the operations of CIA trained Tibetan agents, was troubled by the hostility from the Tibetans: <U+201C>the radio teams were experiencing major resistance from the population inside Tibet.<U+201D><ref>The CIA's Secret War in Tibet, page 220</ref> The CIA trained Tibetans, mostly Buddhists,<ref> The Khampas (Tibetans being trained) were Buddhists, CIA instructors wondered whether they would hesitate to kill a fellow human being.  The CIA was fast coming to realize that the Khampas had few reservations about taking the life of a Chinese invader.  Kenneth Conboy and James Morrison, ''The CIA's Secret War in Tibet'', page 53</ref>  from 1957 to 1972, in the United States, and parachuted them back into Tibet to organize rebellions against the PLA. But with little support from fellow Tibetans they often fell to the hands of the PLA quickly. In one incident, one agent was immediately reported by his own brother and all three agents in the team were arrested. They were not mistreated. After less than a month of propaganda sessions they were escorted to the Indian border and released. <ref> ''The CIA's Secret War in Tibet'', page 213</ref>
