{{capital punishment}}
'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is legal in '''[[Singapore]]'''. The city-state had the second highest per-capita execution rate in the world between 1994 and 1999, estimated by the [[United Nations]] to be 1.383 executions annually per hundred thousand of population during that period.<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/10_commission/10e.pdf para 68 UNODC.org (page 18)]</ref> The highest was [[Turkmenistan]] (now an abolitionist country) with 1.492. Each execution in Singapore is carried out by [[hanging]] in [[Changi Prison]] at dawn on Friday. Foreigners are not exempt from capital punishment.

Singapore has had capital punishment since it was a [[British Empire#Britain's "Imperial Century" (1815-1914)|British colony]] and became independent before the [[United Kingdom]] abolished capital punishment. The Singaporean procedure of hanging condemned individuals is heavily influenced by the methods formerly used in [[Great Britain]].

In 2012, however, the State amended its law to exempt some cases from the mandatory sentence while boosting enforcement.  Although the penalty will stay, discretionary measures are  now given to the judge. Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. <ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-14/singapore-amends-death-penalty-law-to-exempt-some-offences-1-.html]</ref> 

==Statistics==
The following table of executions was compiled by [[Amnesty International]] from several sources, including statistics supplied by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in January 2001 and government figures reported to ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' in September 2003.<ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions">{{cite web

 | quote = Amnesty International recognizes the need to combat drug trafficking, and the harm that illicit drugs can cause. However there is no convincing evidence that the death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other punishments; Amnesty International is gravely concerned that such presumptions erode the right to a fair trial, increasing the risk that an innocent person may be executed, particularly as the law provides for a mandatory death sentence; Amnesty International opposes the death penalty worldwide in all cases without exception; Relatives have informed Amnesty International that prisoners under sentence of death are kept in strict isolation in individual cells measuring approximately three square meters. The cells are thought to have walls on three sides, with bars on the remaining side.  Cells are sparse, furnished only with a toilet and a mat for sleeping, but no bedding.  Inmates are allowed the use of a bucket for washing; They may receive one 20-minute visit per week in a special area where they are separated from visitors by a thick pane of glass and have to communicate via a telephone. About four days before the execution date, as a special concession, prisoners are permitted to watch television or listen to the radio and are given meals of their choice, within the prison<U+2019>s budget.  They are also allowed extra visits from relatives but no physical contact is permitted at any time before the execution; In July 2001 then parliamentarian and prominent human rights campaigner, J.B. Jeyaretnam, called for a parliamentary debate about the case of a drug user who was facing execution, urging the Cabinet to consider various aspects of the case during examination of his clemency appeal. J.B. Jeyaretnam was given just a few minutes to speak before his arguments were rebutted by the Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs.

Detailed statistics are not released by the government of Singapore from 2000 to 2006. Singapore's [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]] told the [[BBC]] in September 2003 that he believed there were "in the region of about 70 to 80" hangings in 2003. Two days later he retracted his statement, saying the number was in fact ten.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/24/1064083055829.html|title=More people executed in Singapore|date=25 September 2003|accessdate=2007-12-30|AFP | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}</ref>

The chief executioner, Darshan Singh, said that he has executed more than 850 people during his service from 1959 using the phrase: "I am going to send you to a better place than this. God bless you." This included 18 people on one day, using three ropes at a time. Singh also said that he has hanged 7 people within 90 minutes.<ref>{{cite news

 | quote = Mr Singh joined the British colonial prison service in the mid-1950s after arriving from Malaysia. When the long-established British hangman Mr Seymour retired, Singh, then 27, volunteered for the job. He was attracted by the bonus payment for executions.

Mr Singh is credited with being the only executioner in the world to single-handedly hang 18 men in one day -- three at a time.

They had been convicted of murdering four prison officers during a riot on the penal island of Pulau Senang in 1963.

He also hanged seven condemned men within 90 minutes a few years later. They had been convicted in what became known as the "gold bars murders", in which a merchant and two employees were killed during a robbery.

One of the most controversial executions in his career was the 1991 hanging of a young Filipina maid, Flor Contemplacion, who was convicted of the murder of a co-worker, Delia Maga, and her four-year-old son, on what many believed was shaky evidence.

He carries out the executions wearing simple casual clothes, often just a T-shirt, shorts, sports shoes and knee-length socks.

To mark his 500th hanging four years ago, four of his former colleagues turned up at his home to celebrate the event with a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon.

Mr Singh boasts that he has never botched an execution.

"Mr Seymour taught him just how long the drop should be according to weight and height and exactly where the knot should be placed at the back of the neck," his colleague said.

"Death has always come instantaneously and painlessly. In that split second, at precisely 6am, it's all over."

===Foreign nationals===
The people on death row include foreign nationals, many of whom were convicted of drug-related offences. These inmates come from a diverse group of countries including Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Portugal. Figures released by the Singapore government show that between 1993 to 2003, 36% of those executed were foreigners, including some residents in Singapore (one quarter of Singapore residents are foreigners).<ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report">{{cite web

 | publisher = Ministry of Home Affairs
 | quote = Contrary to AI's claims, Singaporeans, not foreigners, were the majority of those executed in Singapore. From 1993 to 2003, 64% of those executed were Singaporeans. In the last five years, 73% executed were Singaporeans. Given that one in four residents in Singapore is a foreigner, it is not only false but mischievous to allege that a significant proportion of prisoners executed were foreigners; Although family members are not with the inmate at the moment of execution, they are informed four days before the executions (for foreigners, the families and embassy will be informed earlier, usually seven to fourteen days) and allowed daily visits lasting up to four hours for each visit during these four days. The execution is carried out in the presence of a Prison medical doctor. Upon request, a priest or a religious minister is allowed to be present, to pray for the person to be executed; Our prison conditions are spartan but adequate. Visiting Justices, who are prominent members of the community, conduct regular unannounced visits to the prison institutions to make sure that prisoners, including those on death row, are not ill-treated. It is not true that prisoners are not allowed to exercise. All prisoners, including condemned prisoners, are entitled to their daily exercises. In fact, there are two exercise yards dedicated for this use. They are normally allowed to exercise twice a day, half an hour each time, one or two at a time.

==Legislation==
Under Section 316 of the [[Criminal law of Singapore#Criminal procedure|Criminal Procedure Code]]:<ref>{{Singapore legislation | cap = 68 | ed = 1985}}</ref>
:"When any person is sentenced to death, the sentence shall direct that he shall be hanged by the neck till he is dead but shall not state the place where nor the time when the sentence is to be carried out."
Hangings always take place at dawn on Friday and are by the [[Hanging#Long drop|long drop]] method developed in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[William Marwood]]. The executioner refers to the [[Official Table of Drops]]. The government have said that they:
:"<U+2026>had previously studied the different methods of execution and found no reason to change from the current method used, that is, by hanging."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2005/11/21/1513132.htm|title=Singapore stands by hanging|date=21 November 2005|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>

Neither persons under the age of 18 at the time of their offence nor pregnant women can be sentenced to death.

Capital cases are heard by a single judge in the [[High Court of Singapore]]. After conviction and sentencing, the sentenced has one appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore]]. If the appeal fails, the final recourse rests with the [[President of Singapore]], who has the power to grant clemency on the advice of the Cabinet. The exact number of successful appeals is unknown. [[Poh Kay Keong]] had his conviction overturned after the Court found his statement to a Central Narcotics Bureau officer was made under duress.<ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/>
Successful clemency applications are thought to be even rarer. Since 1965, the President's clemency has been granted six times.<ref>{{cite news| title = 19 murders in first 11 months of 2006, one more than same period in 2005 | publisher = Channel NewsAsia |date=29 December 2006 | author = Rita Zahara | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/249756/1/.html}}</ref> The last clemency was in May 1998 when [[Mathavakannan Kalimuthu]] received pardon from President [[Ong Teng Cheong]] with the sentence commuted to life imprisonment.

The condemned are given notice at least four days before execution. In the case of foreigners who have been sentenced to death, their families and diplomatic missions/embassies are given one to two weeks' notice.<ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/>

Amnesty International reports that death row inmates are housed in cells of roughly 3 sqm (32 sq ft).<ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/> Walls make up three sides, while the fourth is vertical bars. They are equipped with a toilet, sleeping mat and a bucket for washing. Exercise is permitted twice a day for half an hour at a time.<ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/> Four days before the execution, the condemned is allowed to watch television or listen to the radio.<ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/>
Special meals of their choice are also cooked, if within the prison budget. Visitation rights are increased from one 20 minute visit per week to a maximum of four hours each day,<ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/> though no physical contact is allowed with any visitors.<ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/>

==Capital offences==
In addition to the Penal Code, there are four [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] in Singapore that prescribe death as punishment for offences. According to the local [[civil rights]] group, the [[Think Centre]], 70% of hangings are for drug-related offences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=1425|title=Singapore Death Penalty Shrouded In Silence|publisher=Reuters|date=12 April 2002|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>

===Penal Code===
Under the Penal Code,<ref>{{Singapore legislation | cap = 224 | ed = 1985}}</ref> the commission of the following offences may result in the death penalty:
*Waging or attempting to wage war or abetting the waging of war against the Government
*Offences against the President<U+2019>s person (in other words, treason)
*Mutiny
*Piracy that endangers life
*Terrorism 
*Perjury that results in the execution of an innocent person
*Murder
*Abetting the suicide of a person under the age of 18 or an "insane" person
*Attempted murder by a prisoner serving a life sentence
*Kidnapping or abducting in order to murder
*Robbery committed by five or more people that results in the death of a person
*Drug trafficking
*Unlawful discharge of firearms, even if no one is injured

===Misuse of Drugs Act===
[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|The Singapore embarkation card contains a warning to visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]]. Warning signs can also be found at the [[Johor-Singapore Causeway]] and other border entries.]]

Under Schedule 2 of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]],<ref>{{Singapore legislation | cap = 185 | ed = 2001}}</ref><ref>[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2008-REVED-185&segid=1207125305-001819 SECOND SCHEDULE - OFFENCES PUNISHABLE ON CONVICTION]</ref> any person importing, exporting, or found in possession of more than the following quantities of drugs receives a mandatory death sentence:

* 1200&nbsp;grammes of [[opium]] and containing more than 30&nbsp;grammes of morphine (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (2)(b));
* 30&nbsp;grammes of [[morphine]] (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (3)(b));
* 15&nbsp;grammes of [[diamorphine]] (heroin) (diamo (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (4)(b));
* 30&nbsp;grammes of [[cocaine]] (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (5)(b));
* 500&nbsp;grammes of [[cannabis]] (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (6)(b));
* 1000&nbsp;grammes of cannabis mixture (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (7)(b));
* 200&nbsp;grammes of cannabis resin (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (8)(b));
* 250&nbsp;grammes of [[methamphetamine]] (<U+00A7>5 and <U+00A7>7, (9)(b)).

Death sentences are also mandatory for any person caught manufacturing :

*Morphine, or any salt of morphine, ester of morphine or salt of ester of morphine (<U+00A7>6, (2));
*Diamorphine (heroin) or any salt of diamorphine (<U+00A7>6, (3));
*Cocaine or any salt of cocaine (<U+00A7>6, (4));
*Methamphetamine (<U+00A7>6, (5)).

Under the Act:
:"any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control <U+2014>

::(a) anything containing a controlled drug;
::(b) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;
::(c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or
::(d) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,

:shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession."

Furthermore, any person who has a controlled drug in his possession shall be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

It would also be interesting to note that Singapore has one of the lowest prevalence of drug abuse worldwide. Over two decades, the number of drug abusers arrested each year has declined by two-thirds, from over 6,000 in the early 1990s to about 2,000 in 2011.<ref> [http://www.fivestarsandamoon.com/?p=864] </ref>

===Internal Security Act===
The preamble of the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] states that it is an Act to "provide for the internal security of Singapore, preventive detention, the prevention of subversion, the suppression of organised violence against persons and property in specified areas of Singapore, and for matters incidental thereto."<ref>{{Singapore legislation | cap = 143 | ed = 1985}}</ref> The President of Singapore has the power to designate certain security areas. Any person caught in the possession or with someone in possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives in a security area can be punished by death.

===Arms Offences Act===
The [[Arms Offences Act (Singapore)|Arms Offences Act]] regulates firearms offences.<ref>{{Singapore legislation | cap = 14 | ed = 1998}}</ref> Any person who uses or attempts to use arms (Section 4) can face execution, as well as any person who uses or attempts to use arms to commit scheduled offences (Section 4A). These scheduled offences are being a member of an unlawful assembly; rioting; certain offences against the person; abduction or kidnapping; extortion; burglary; robbery; preventing or resisting arrest; vandalism; mischief. Any person who is an accomplice (Section 5) to a person convicted of arms use during a scheduled offence can likewise be executed.

Trafficking in arms (Section 6) is a capital offence in Singapore. Under the Arms Offences Act, trafficking is defined as being in unlawful possession of more than two firearms.

===Kidnapping Act===
The terms of the [[Kidnapping Act (Singapore)|Kidnapping Act]] designate abduction, wrongful restraint or wrongful confinement for ransom as capital offences.<ref>{{Singapore legislation | cap = 151 | ed = 1999}}</ref>

==Public debate==
Public debate in the Singaporean news media on the death penalty is almost non-existent, although the topic does occasionally get discussed in the midst of major, well-known criminal cases. Efforts to garner public opinion on the issue are rare, although it has been suggested that the population is influenced by the traditional Chinese view which held that harsh punishment deters crime and helps maintain social peace and harmony.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40319 | title = DEATH PENALTY-SINGAPORE:  Stand at UN Leaves Many Angered |date=3 December 2007 | publisher = IPS | author = Baradan Kuppusamy}}</ref> In October 2007, Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs [[Ho Peng Kee]] said in Parliament that "Certain of us may hold the view that the death penalty should be abolished. But in a survey done two years ago, reported in the Straits Times, 95% of Singaporeans feel that the death penalty should stay. This is something which has helped us to be safe and secure all these years and it is only reserved for a very few select offences."<ref>Peng Kee, Ho, ''Singapore Parliamentary Reports'', 11th Parliament, Session 1, Volume 83, 23 October 2007.</ref>

[[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam]], a former [[Member of Parliament]] in Singapore, was reportedly only given a few minutes to speak in Parliament on the issue before his comments were rebutted by [[Ho Peng Kee]], Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs.<ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/><ref>{{cite web

Few other opposition members in parliament would bring up the issue, which may be reflective of a population generally indifferent to the matter.

[[File:Shanmugam.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Shanmugam Murugesu]]]]

Before the hanging of [[Shanmugam Murugesu]], a three-hour vigil was held on 6 May 2005. The organisers of the event at the [[Furama Hotel]] said it was the first such public gathering organised solely by members of the public against the death penalty in Singapore. Murugesu had been arrested after being caught in possession of six packets containing just over 1&nbsp;kg of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] after returning from [[Malaysia]].

After the hanging of [[Van Tuong Nguyen]], a Vietnamese-Australian from [[Melbourne]], on 2 December 2005, Sister [[Susan Chia]], province leader of the [[Good Shepherd Sisters]] in Singapore, declared that "The death penalty is cruel, inhumane and it violates the right to life." Chia and several other nuns comforted Nguyen's mother two weeks before his execution for heroin trafficking.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/end-death-penalty-singapore-nun/2005/12/03/1133422148176.html |title=End death penalty: Singapore nun | publisher = The Age | date = 4 December 2005 | location=Melbourne}}</ref>

Singapore's death penalty laws have drawn comments in the media. For example, science fiction author [[William Ford Gibson|William Gibson]], while a journalist, wrote a travel piece on Singapore that he sarcastically titled "[[Disneyland with the Death Penalty]]."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/gibson.html |title=[[Disneyland with the Death Penalty]] | work= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=September 1993}}</ref>

{{quote|My so-called apology was to merely point out that my book was sub-titled Singapore Justice in the Dock - NOT Singapore Judiciary in the Dock.  I did not 'apologise' at all and welcomed the prison sentence which drew even more attention to the real issues.  The many cases I exposed where various judges sentenced some accused to death despite dubious, suspect evidence concocted by the police and their informers while others with powerful countries behind them had their charges inexplicably reduced to a non-hanging offence.  But Judge Loh completely ignored the evidence I produced in Once a Jolly Hangman even though he claimed to have read it from cover to cover.  This proved again that the judiciary is not independent from the executive - a fact which the International Bar Association ably pointed out in its 2008 report on Singapore - and that the judicary has to do the governments bidding when it suits them.}}

===Law Society review===
In December 2005, the [[Law Society of Singapore]] revealed that it has set up a committee, named ''Review Committee on Capital Punishment'', to examine capital punishment in the country. The President of the Society, [[Senior Counsel]] [[Philip Jeyaretnam]], said that the main focus of the review was on issues regarding administering the death penalty such as whether it should be mandatory. A report of the review would be submitted to the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]].<ref>{{cite news| title = Singapore's Law Society to give death penalty a fair airing | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/187994/1/.html | date = 2006-01-13 | author = Ansley Ng | publisher = [[Today (Singapore newspaper)]]}}</ref> On 6 November 2006, they were invited to give its views on proposed amendments to the Penal Code to the Ministry of Home Affairs. In their report, issued on 30 March 2007, they argued against the mandatory death penalty:
<blockquote>
The death penalty should be discretionary for the offences where the death sentence is mandatory - murder, drug trafficking, firearms offences and sedition - a position similar to that for the offence of kidnapping. There are strong arguments for changing the mandatory nature of capital punishment in Singapore. Judges should be given the discretion to impose the death penalty only where deemed appropriate.<ref>Extract of the Council<U+2019>s Report on the proposed Penal Code Amendments submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs, March 30, 2007, [http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/feedback_pc/pdf/execSummary.aspx lawsociety.org]</ref>
</blockquote>

=== Singapore government's response ===
The Singapore government states that the death penalty is only used in the most serious of crimes, sending, they say, a strong message to potential offenders. They point out that in 1994 and 1999 the [[United Nations General Assembly]] failed to adopt [[United Nations resolution|resolutions]] calling for a moratorium on the death penalty worldwide, as a majority of countries opposed such a move.

The Permanent Representative of the Republic of Singapore to the [[United Nations]] wrote a letter to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]], summary or arbitrary executions in 2001 which stated:
:"<U+2026>the death penalty is primarily a criminal justice issue, and therefore is a question for the sovereign jurisdiction of each country [<U+2026>] the right to life is not the only right, and [<U+2026>] it is the duty of societies and governments to decide how to balance competing rights against each other."<ref name="Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions"/>

In January 2004, the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] issued a response to [[Amnesty International]]'s report, "Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions". It defended the nation's policy to retain the death penalty, predicating its arguments on, amongst others, the following grounds:<ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/>
*There is no international consensus on whether the death penalty should be abolished.
*Each country has the sovereign right to decide on its own judicial system, taking into account its own circumstances.
*The death penalty has been effective in keeping Singapore one of the safest places in the world to work and live in.
*The application of the death penalty is only reserved for "very serious crimes".

The Ministry of Home Affairs also refuted Amnesty International's claims of the majority of the executed being foreigners, and that it was "mostly the poor, least educated, and vulnerable people who are executed." The Ministry stated: "Singaporeans, and not foreigners, were the majority of those executed... Of those executed from 1993 to 2003, 95% were above 21 years of age, and 80% had received formal education. About 80% of those who had been sentenced to capital punishment had employment before their convictions".<ref name="The Singapore Government's Response To Amnesty International's Report"/>

Following the hanging of [[Van Tuong Nguyen]] in 2005, Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] reiterated the government's position, stating that "The evil inflicted on thousands of people with drug trafficking demands that we must tackle the source by punishing the traffickers rather than trying to pick up the pieces afterwards... It's a law which is approved of by Singapore's inhabitants and which allows us to reduce the drug problem."<ref>{{cite web

Prior to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s voting on a moratorium on the death penalty in November 2007, Singapore's ambassador [[Vanu Gopala Menon]] said: "My delegation would like to remind this committee that capital punishment is not prohibited under international law. Yet it is clear that the sponsors of this draft resolution have decided that there can only be one view on capital punishment, and that only one set of choices should be respected... [the death penalty] is an important component of the administration of law and our justice system, and is imposed only for the most serious crimes and serves as a deterrent. We have proper legal safeguards in place to prevent any miscarriage of justice."<ref>{{cite web

==Impact on official debate and discussion in the United States==
In 2012, U.S. elected officials and office-seekers have stated that Singapore's success in combating drug abuse should be examined as a model for the United States. New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] said that America could learn a thing or two from nations like Singapore when it came to drug trafficking, noting that <U+201C>Executing a handful of people saves thousands and thousands of lives."<ref>[http://www.dnainfo.com/20120326/manhattan/us-could-learn-from-singapores-harsh-drug-laws-bloomberg-says  Michael Bloomberg, ''DNA - Manhattan News''  March 26, 2012]</ref> In addition, U.S. presidential candidate [[Newt Gingrich]] repeated his longstanding advocacy for Singaporean methods in America's [[War on Drugs]] during campaign interviews and speeches.<ref>[http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/11/29/377716/gingrich-praises-singapores-very-draconian-laws-that-mandate-executions-for-drug-possession/?mobile=nc Newt  Gingrich on Singapore's Drug laws (2012 interview)]</ref><ref>[[Political positions of Newt Gingrich#Drug policy|Newt Gingrich on U.S. drug policy and drug laws]]</ref>
