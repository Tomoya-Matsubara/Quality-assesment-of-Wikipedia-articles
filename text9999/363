'''Sir William Schwenck Gilbert''' ([[November 18]], [[1836]] &ndash; [[May 29]], [[1911]]) was an [[United Kingdom|English]] [[dramatist]], [[libretto|librettist]] and illustrator best known for his fourteen [[comic opera]]s produced in [[Gilbert and Sullivan|collaboration]] with the [[composer]] [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]]. 

Gilbert's most popular collaborations with Sullivan, including ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and ''[[The Mikado]]'' (one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre)<ref> [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm Kenrick, John, ''G&S Story: Part III''], copy downloaded 13 October, 2006; and [http://www.libertystory.net/LSARTSGILBERT.htm Powell, Jim, ''William S. Gilbert's Wicked Wit for Liberty''] downloaded 13 October, 2006.</ref>  and most of their other [[Savoy opera]]s continue to be performed regularly today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond by opera companies, repertory companies, schools and community theatre groups.  Lines from these works have permanently entered the English language, including "[[short, sharp shock]]",  "What never?  Well, hardly ever!", and "let the punishment fit the crime".<ref>Green, Edward, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3634126.stm "Ballads, songs, and speeches"], BBC, September 20, 2004. (Downloaded 16 October, 2006)</ref>

Gilbert also wrote the [[Bab Ballads]], an extensive collection of light verse accompanied by his own comical drawings.  His creative output included over 75 plays and libretti, numerous stories, poems, lyrics and various other comic and serious pieces.  His plays and [[realism (arts)|realistic]] style of stage direction inspired other dramatists, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Feingold, Michael, [http://www.villagevoice.com/theater/0418,feingold1,53206,11.html "Engaging the Past"], in ''The Village Voice'' May 4th, 2004.</ref>

Gilbert was born at 17 Southampton Street, Strand, London.  His father, also named [[William Gilbert (author)|William]], was a naval surgeon who later became a novelist and short story writer.  Some of his books were illustrated by his son.  Gilbert's mother was the former Ann Morris.  Gilbert's parents were distant and stern, and he did not have a particularly close relationship with either of them. Following the breakup of their marriage in 1876, his relationships with them, especially with his mother, became even more strained. Gilbert had three younger sisters: Jane, Maud, and Florence.<ref name=CrowtherLife>Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html ''The Life of W. S. Gilbert'']</ref>

As a child, Gilbert traveled in Europe with his parents (they finally settled in London in 1849), and was educated at [[Boulogne]], France (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it),<ref>Noted in Morrison, Robert, ''[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_gilbert/fallen_fairies/article.html The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera]''</ref> and then at the Great Ealing School and [[King's College London]], graduating in 1856.  He applied for a military commission in the [[Gordon Highlanders]], but, with the unexpected end of the [[Crimean War]], fewer recruits were needed, and only a line commission was available to Gilbert.  He served in the Civil Service instead for four years and hated it.  In 1859, he joined the newly formed [[Volunteer Army (British)|Volunteer Army]], continuing with them until 1878 (in between writing and other work), and reaching the rank of Captain.<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 5-6 and 157, and How, Harry, [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/strand_article.html Interview of Gilbert]</ref>  Finally, in 1863, he received a bequest of <U+00A3>300 that he used to quit the civil service and take up a brief career as a [[barrister]], but he was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.<ref>Gilbert, W.S. ed. Peter Haining - Introduction</ref>
[[Image:Gentle Alice Brown.jpg|thumb|225px|One of Gilbert's illustrations for his [[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]] "Gentle Alice Brown".]]

To supplement his income from 1861 on, Gilbert wrote a variety of stories, comic rants, theatre reviews (many in the form of a parody of the play being reviewed),<ref>Stedman, Jane W. ''W. S. Gilbert's Theatrical Criticism''. London: The Society for Theatre Research, 2000. ISBN 085430-068-6</ref> and, under the pseudonym "Bab" (his childhood nickname), illustrated poems for several comic magazines, primarily ''Fun'', started in 1861 by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]].  The poems, illustrated humourously by Gilbert, proved immensely popular and were reprinted in book form as the ''[[Bab Ballads]]''.<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 26-29.  See also the introduction to Gilbert, W.S. (1908), ''The Bab Ballads,'' etc, which details the history of the collections it was drawn from.</ref>  He would later return to many of these as source material for his various plays and comic operas.  Gilbert and his colleagues from ''Fun'', including [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]], [[Tom Hood]], [[Clement Scott]] and [[F. C. Burnand]] (who defected to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1862) frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's caf<U+00E9>, where they had a table in competition with the ''Punch'' "Round table".<ref>Stedman, 1996, pp 16-18.  See also Tom Robertson's play ''Society'', which fictionalised the evenings in Evans's caf<U+00E9> in one scene, and  [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/information_areas/journals/19th%20century/300001.pdf Schoch, Richard, ''Performing Bohemia'' (2004)] (copy downloaded 13 October, 2006), a deeper analysis.</ref>

Gilbert married Lucy Agnes Turner in 1867 (she was 11 years younger than he).  He wrote many affectionate letters to her over the years.  In addition, Gilbert and Lucy were socially active both in London and later at Grim's Dyke, often holding dinner parties and being invited to others' homes for dinner, in contrast to the picture painted by fictionalizations like the film ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]''.<ref>Ainger, p. 148 and Stedman (1996), pp. 318-20. See also Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/chapter16.htm Chapter 16]</ref>

===First plays===
Gilbert wrote and directed a number of plays at school, but his first professionally produced play was ''Uncle Baby'', which ran for seven weeks in the fall of 1863.<ref>David Eden (in ''Gilbert and Sullivan: The Creative Conflict'' 1986) suggests that this play was by, or in collaboration with, Gilbert's father, although Crowther says that Eden gives no foundation for this suggestion. See [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html Crowther, Andrew, ''The Life of W. S. Gilbert''].</ref> His next produced work, ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (an 1866 [[burlesque]] of [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]''), was Gilbert's first commercial success, rushed to the stage in 10 days at the request of his friend Tom Robertson.  ''Dulcamara'''s popularity ensured a long series of further burlesques, [[pantomime]]s and farces, full of awful puns (traditional in burlesques of the period),<ref name="LaViv">Gilbert, W. S. ''La Viviandre, or, True to the Corps!'' (a burlesque of Donizetti's ''[[The Daughter of the Regiment]]'')</ref> though they do, at times, show signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of his work.<ref name=CambridgeHistory>[http://www.bartelby.net/223/0815.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'', Volume XIII, Chapter VIII, Section 15] (1907<U+2013>21), The full quote refers to Pygmalion and Galatea and reads: "The satire is shrewd, but not profound; the young author is apt to sneer, and he has by no means learned to make the best use of his curiously logical fancy. That he occasionally degrades high and beautiful themes is not surprising.  To do so had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it; but Gilbert<U+2019>s is not the then usual hearty cockney vulgarity."</ref> For instance:

:That men were monkeys once&mdash;to that I bow;
:''(looking at Lord Margate)'' I know one who's less man than monkey, now,
:That monkeys once were men, peers, statesmen, flunkies&mdash;
:That's rather hard on unoffending monkeys!<ref name="LaViv" />

<!-- The quote from The Pretty Druidess where Gilbert announces his leaving behind of these derivative works would be useful here. -->In Victorian theatre, "[to degrade] high and beautiful themes... had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it...."<ref name=CambridgeHistory /> However, Gilbert's burlesques were considered unusually tasteful compared to the others on the London stage, and he would depart even further from the burlesque style from about 1869 with plays containing original plots and fewer puns.<ref name=CrowtherLife />

Theatre, at the time Gilbert began writing, had fallen into disrepute.  Badly translated and adapted French [[operetta]]s and poorly written, prurient [[burlesque]]s dominated the London stage.  As [[Jessie Bond]] vividly described it, "stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder."<ref>Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm Introduction.]. Bond created the mezzo-soprano roles in most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and is here leading in to a description of Gilbert's role reforming the Victorian theatre.</ref>

From 1869 to 1875, Gilbert joined with one of the leading figures in theatrical reform, [[Thomas German Reed]] (and his wife), whose [[German Reed Entertainment|Gallery of Illustration]] sought to regain some of theatre's lost respectability by offering family entertainments in London.<ref Name=JessieBond>Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm Introduction.] </ref> Three months before the opening of Gilbert's last burlesque (''The Pretty Druidess''), the first of his pieces for the Gallery of Illustration, ''[[No Cards]]'', was produced.  Gilbert created six musical entertainments for the German Reeds, some with music composed by Thomas German Reed himself.<ref name=PlayList>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/other_gilbert.html List of Gilbert's Plays at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive]</ref>

The environment of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management.<ref name=CrowtherLife /> These works were a success,<ref>Steadman (1996), pp. 69-80.</ref> with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, ''[[Ages Ago]]'', opening in 1869.  ''Ages Ago'' was also the beginning of a collaboration with the composer [[Frederic Clay]] that would last seven years and produce four works.<ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo>Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html Analysis of Ages Ago]</ref>  It was at a rehearsal for ''Ages Ago'' that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, [[Arthur Sullivan]].<ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo />  

Many of the plot elements of the German Reed Entertainments (as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads) would be reused by Gilbert later in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.  These elements include paintings coming to life (''Ages Ago'', used again in ''[[Ruddigore]]''), the forceful mature lady who is "an acquired taste" (''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'', reused in ''[[The Mikado]]''), and a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man's son to a "pirate" instead of to a "pilot" by mistake (''[[Our Island Home]]'', 1870, reused in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'').<ref>Smith, J. Donald, ''[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/reed_operas.htm W. S. Gilbert's Operas for the German Reeds]''</ref>  During this time, Gilbert perfected the "topsy-turvy" style that he had been developing in his Bab Ballads, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd.<ref>[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ajcrowth/wsglife.htm Andrew Crowther's description of Gilbert's style of humor].  See also [http://www.lyricoperasandiego.com/Education/PeopleGilbert.htm the description of Gilbert's style of humour here] and Gilbert's play, ''[[Topysturveydom]]''.</ref> 

At the same time, Gilbert created several "fairy comedies" at the [[Haymarket Theatre]].  This series of plays was founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.<ref>[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/others/pygmalion.html "Miss Anderson as Galatea", ''The New-York Times'', 1883 January 23 32(9791): 5, col. 3 Amusements] Downloaded 15 October, 2006.</ref>  The first was ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), based on a story by [[Madame de Genlis]].  In 1871, with ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', one of seven plays that he produced that year, Gilbert scored his greatest hit to date.  Together, these plays and their successors such as ''The Wicked World'' (1873), ''Sweethearts'' (1874) and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage:  they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque, won him artistic credentials, and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range, as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour.  The success of these plays, especially ''Pygmalion and Galatea'', gave Gilbert a prestige that would be crucial to his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan.<ref name=Wren>[http://www.oup.com/pdf/0195145143_01.pdf Wren, Gayden, 2006, ''A Most Ingenious Paradox'' (The first chapter, [http://www.oup.com/pdf/0195145143_01.pdf "Gilbert before Sullivan,"]is available on the publisher's website.)]</ref>

Though dated, these works demonstrate Gilbert's desire to give respectable and well-educated theatre audiences comedies that were more refined and tasteful than the usual farces and burlesques playing in London.<ref name="CrowtherLife"/> On the other hand, during the same period, Gilbert pushed the boundaries of how far satire could go in the theatre.  He collaborated with [[Gilbert Arthur <U+00E0> Beckett]] on ''The Happy Land'' (1873), a political satire (in part, a parody of his own ''The Wicked World''), which was briefly banned because of its unflattering caricatures of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and his ministers.<ref name="CrowtherLife"/> Similarly, ''The Realm of Joy'' (1873) was set in the lobby of a theatre performing a scandalous play (in the ''Happy Land'' mold), with many jokes at the expense of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (the "Lord High Disinfectant", as he's referred to in the play), and two men having an affair with the other man's wife.<ref>Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/joy_synopsis.html Synopsis of ''The Realm of Joy'']</ref> In ''[[Charity (play)|Charity]]'' (1874), however, Gilbert uses the freedom of the stage in a different way: to provide a tightly-written critique of the contrasting ways in which Victorian society treated men and women who had sex outside of marriage, which anticipated the "problem plays" of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] and [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]].<ref name=CrowtherCharity>Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/charity.html Synopsis of ''Charity'']</ref>

===Gilbert as a director===

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is absolutely essential to the success of this piece that it should be played with the most perfect earnestness and gravity throughout. There should be no exaggeration in costume, make<U+00AD>up or demeanour; and the characters, one and all, should appear to believe, throughout, in the perfect sincerity of their words and actions. Directly the actors show that they are conscious of the absurdity of their utterances the piece begins to drag."

Gilbert was the stage director for his plays and operas and had strong opinions on how they should best be performed.  Gilbert was strongly influenced by the innovations in "stagecraft", or what we now call stage direction, by the playwrights [[James Planche]] and especially [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]].<ref name=JessieBond /> Gilbert attended rehearsals directed by Robertson to learn this art firsthand from the older director, and he began to apply it in some of his earliest plays.<ref name=CrowtherLife />  He sought realism in acting, if not in content of his plays, shunned interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity, but were coherent internal wholes.<ref>Cox-Ife, William. ''W. S. Gilbert: Stage Director''. Dobson, 1978 ISBN 0-234-77206-9.  See also Gilbert, W. S., [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/stage_play.html A Stage Play], Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/introduction.htm Introduction], etc.</ref> In Gilbert's burlesque, ''Rosencratz and Guildenstern'' (1874), the character Hamlet, in his speech to the players, sums up Gilbert's theory of comic acting: "I hold that there is no such antick fellow as your bombastical hero who doth so earnestly spout forth his folly as to make his hearers believe that he is unconscious of all incongruity".  With his work along these lines, Gilbert set the ground for later playwrights such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] to be able to flourish on the English stage.<ref name=CrowtherLife />

Gilbert insisted that his actors knew their words perfectly and obeyed his stage directions, which was something quite new to many actors of the day.<ref>Cox-Ife, William. ''W. S. Gilbert: Stage Director''. Dobson, 1978 ISBN 0-234-77206-9.</ref> Even during long runs and revivals, Gilbert closely supervised the performances of his plays, making sure that the actors did not make unauthorised additions, deletions or paraphrases.<ref>See, e.g. Steadman (1996), p. 269 (quoting a 30 April 1890 letter from Gilbert to D'Oyly Carte); Gilbert, W.S., [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/stage_play.html A Stage Play]; Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/chapter04_txt.htm Chapter 4]; [http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/musicals_tour/first_musicals/doyly_carte.php PeoplePlay UK, ''D'Oyly Carte''], etc.</ref> Gilbert was famous for demonstrating the action himself, even as he grew older.<ref>In Gilbert, W.S., [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/stage_play.html A Stage Play], Gilbert describes the effect of these demonstrations: "...when he endeavours to show what he wants his actors to do, he makes himself rather ridiculous, and there is a good deal of tittering at the wings; but he contrives, nevertheless, to make himself understood..."

Gilbert'']</ref>  Gilbert himself went on stage in a number of productions throughout his lifetime, including several performances as "the Associate" in the ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', as substitute for an ailing actor in his play ''[[Broken Hearts]]'', and in charity matinees of his one-act plays, such as King Claudius in ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern''.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/notes.html Robert Morrison, in editorial notes to [[Henry Lytton]]'s book, ''The Secrets of a Savoyard''].</ref>

==The collaboration with Sullivan==
===First collaborations amidst other works===
[[Image:Sullivan-GS.jpg|right|thumb|Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan]]
In [[1871]], John Hollingshead commissioned Gilbert to work with Sullivan on a holiday piece for Christmas, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old]]'', at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]].  ''Thespis'' outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season and was later revived for a benefit performance.  However, nothing more came of it at that point, and Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways.  Gilbert worked again with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872), and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), <!--Alternative spelling: Topsyturvydom-->as well as writing several farces, operetta libretti, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, adaptations from novels, translations from the French, and the dramas described above.  Also in 1874, he published his last contibution for ''Fun'' magazine (''"Rosencratz and Guildenstern"''), after a gap of three years, then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner's other publishing interests.<ref>Jones, John Bush, "W.S. Gilbert's Contributions to Fun, 1865-1874", published in the ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library'', vol 73 (April 1969), pp253-266</ref>

It would be nearly four years after ''Thespis'' was produced before the two men worked together again.  In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comedic piece entitled "Trial by Jury: An Operetta".  In 1873, Gilbert arranged with the theatrical manager and composer, [[Carl Rosa]], to expand the piece into a one-act libretto.  Rosa's wife was to sing the role of the plaintiff.  However, Rosa's wife died in childbirth in 1874.  Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to [[Offenbach]]'s ''[[La P<U+00E9>richole]]''.  He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work.  Sullivan was enthusiastic, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks.  The little piece was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La P<U+00E9>richole'' and being revived at another theatre.<ref>Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/walbrook/chap3.html ''Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment''(Chapter 3)]. See also Barker, John W. [http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.html "Gilbert and Sullivan"], which quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: "As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."</ref>   [[Image:Ws_gilbert_cartoon.png|thumb|Caricature from ''Punch'', 1881]] 

Gilbert continued his quest to gain respect in and respectability for his profession.  One thing that may have been holding dramatists back from respectability was that plays were not published in a form suitable for a "gentleman's library", as, at the time, they were generally cheaply and unattractively published for the use of actors rather than the home reader.  To help rectify this, at least for himself, Gilbert arranged in late 1875 for publishers Chatto and Windus to print a volume of his plays in a format designed to appeal to the general reader, with an attractive binding and clear type, containing Gilbert's most respectable plays, including his most serious works, but mischievously capped off with ''Trial by Jury''.<ref name=CrowtherLife/> 

After the success of ''Trial by Jury'', there were discussions towards reviving ''Thespis'', but Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to ''Thespis'' was never published, and most of the music is now lost.  It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' (1875), ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875) and ''Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith'' (1877).<ref name=PlayList />

Also during this period, Gilbert wrote his most successful comic play, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), which inspired [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.  ''Engaged'' is a parody of romantic drama written in the "topsy-turvy" satiric style of many of Gilbert's Bab Ballads and the [[Savoy Operas]], with one character pledging his love, in the most poetic and romantic language possible, to every single woman in the play; the "innocent" Scottish rustics being revealed to be making a living through throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services, and, in general, romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain. ''Engaged'' continues to be performed today by both professional and amateur companies.<ref>Gilbert, W. S., [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/engaged.txt ''Engaged''], see also Feingold, Michael, [http://www.villagevoice.com/theater/0418,feingold1,53206,11.html "Engaging the Past"] (Note the last paragraph, where Feingold writes, "Wilde pillaged this piece for ideas."); Gardner, Lyn, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/review/0,,852202,00.html Review of Engaged in ''The Guardian''], Manus, Willard, [http://lively-arts.com/theatre/0405/gilbert-sullivan.htm Review of a New York production of ''Engaged''], etc.</ref>

===The peak collaborative years===
[[Image:Sorc-Pin-Trial.jpg|thumb|300px|An early poster showing the first three [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas after [[Thespis]].]]
{{main|Gilbert and Sullivan}}
Carte finally assembled a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company to launch a series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in November 1877.  This work was a modest success,<ref name=CrowtherLife /> and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a scorching summer, ''Pinafore'' became a red-hot favourite by autumn.  After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production.  The attempt was repelled by stagehands and others at the theatre loyal to Carte, and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].<ref>Bond, Jessie, [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/bond/chapter04_txt.htm Chapter 4].</ref>

For the next decade, the [[Savoy opera|Savoy Operas]] (as the series came to be known, after the [[Savoy Theatre|theatre]] Carte later built to house them) were Gilbert's principal activity.  The successful comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two, several of them being among the longest-running productions up to that point in the history of the musical stage.<ref>[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html List of longest running London shows through 1920].  This list shows that''Pinafore'', ''Patience'' and ''The Mikado'' each held the position of second longest-running musical theatre production in history for a time (after adjusting Pinafore's initial run down to 571 performances), and ''The Gondoliers'' was not far behind.</ref>  After ''Pinafore'' came ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881), ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889).  Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works, but he actually ''designed'' the costumes himself for ''Patience'', ''Iolanthe'', ''Princess Ida'', and ''Ruddigore''.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/whowaswho/G/GilbertWS.htm Profile of W. S. Gilbert]</ref>

During this time, Gilbert and Sullivan also collaborated on one other major work, the oratorio ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'', premiered at the Leeds music festival in October 1880. Gilbert arranged the original epic poem into a libretto suitable for the music, and it contains some original work.  During this period, Gilbert occasionally wrote plays to be performed elsewhere &ndash; both serious dramas (for example ''The Ne'er-Do-Weel'', 1878) and humorous works (for example ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'', 1881).  However, he no longer needed to turn out multiple plays each year, as he had done before.  Indeed, during the more than nine years that separated ''The Pirates of Penzance'' and ''The Gondoliers'', he wrote just three plays outside of the partnership with Sullivan.<ref name=PlayList />  None of these works proved very successful.<ref>For example, Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/html/failure.html Foggerty's Failure]</ref>

===The Carpet Quarrel and end of the collaboration===
Gilbert sometimes had a strained working relationship with Sullivan, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two&mdash;Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict. In addition, Gilbert imbued his libretti with "topsy-turvy" situations in which the social order was turned upside down.  After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<ref>See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3</ref>  In addition, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege, while Sullivan was eager to socialize among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons.<ref>See, e.g. Jacobs, Arthur (1992); Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html The Life of W.S. Gilbert]; and Bond, Jessie, [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/bond/chapter16_txt.htm Chapter 16]</ref>

Throughout their collaboration, Gilbert and Sullivan quarreled several times over the choice of a subject.  After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' through ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him.  While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works.  On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.<ref>Crowther, Andrew, [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html The Carpet Quarrel Explained].</ref>

During the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:

:After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May, 1891, a year after the end of the "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted "an unintentional overcharge of nearly <U+00A3>1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone."<ref name=Carpet>Crowther, Andrew, [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html The Carpet Quarrel Explained]</ref>
[[Image:Utopia Limited Poster.jpg|thumb|400px|The Drawing Room Scene from [[Utopia, Limited]].]]
Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building a theatre in London for the production of new English grand operas, with Sullivan's ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' as the inaugural work. While the protracted quarrel worked itself out in the courts and in public, Gilbert wrote ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' with [[Alfred Cellier]] and the flop ''[[Haste to the Wedding]]'' with [[George Grossmith]].<ref name=PlayList /> 

In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair, [[William Chappell|Tom Chappell]], the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded.<ref>Wolfson, p. 7.</ref> Two more operas resulted: ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893) and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896).  Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'', 1894), but Gilbert's insistance on casting [[Nancy McIntosh]], his proteg<U+00E9>e from ''Utopia'', led to Sullivan's refusal.<ref> Wolfson, pp. 61-65.</ref>  ''Utopia'' was a very modest success, and ''The Grand Duke'' was an outright failure, after which the partnership ended for good.<ref>Wolfson, passim</ref>

==Later years==
Gilbert had moved to [[Grim's Dyke]] [[Harrow]] in 1890,<ref>Stedman (1996), p. 278.</ref> and in 1891 was named a [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[Middlesex]].<ref>Steadman (1996) p. 281</ref>  Having met Nancy McIntosh and cast her in ''Utopia, Limited'' and ''His Excellency'', Gilbert and Lady Gilbert both developed an affection for her, and she became their unofficially adopted daughter, eventually moving to Grim's Dyke to live with them.  Even after Gilbert's death, McIntosh continued to live with Lady Gilbert for another 25 years until Lady Gilbert's death in 1936.<ref>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/M/McIntoshNancy.htm Who Was Who in The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company: Nancy McIntosh] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive.</ref>

Although Gilbert announced a retirement from the theatre after the poor initial run of his last work with Sullivan, ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896), he produced four more plays over the last 15 years of his life, including an unsuccessful opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909), with [[Edward German]].<ref>Wolfson, pp. 102-03.</ref>  Gilbert also continued to personally supervise the various revivals of his works by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.<ref>Wolfson, p. 102</ref>  His last play, ''[[The Hooligan]]'', produced just four months before his death, is a study of a young condemned thug in a prison cell.  The piece was so grim and powerful that, according to Mrs. Alec Tweedie, "women [in the audience] had gone out fainting".  ''The Hooligan'' was one of Gilbert's most successful serious dramas, and experts conclude that, in those last months of Gilbert's life, he was developing a new style, a "mixture of irony, of social theme, and of grubby realism,"<ref>Stedman (1996), quoted by Crowther [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ajcrowth/stedrev.htm here]</ref> to replace the old "Gilbertianism" that he had grown weary of.<ref>Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/hooligan/index.html Notes on the Hooligan]</ref> [[Image: Memorial To WS Gilbert.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to W. S. Gilbert on [[Victoria Embankment]], London]]

Gilbert has been accused of being prickly and hard to get along with, but he could be extraordinarily kind.<ref>Bond, Jessie, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/chapter16_txt.htm Chapter 16] comments: "Gilbert has come in for much criticism lately that I think unjust; he was quick-tempered, often unreasonable, and he could not bear to be thwarted, but how anyone could call him unamiable I cannot understand.  Those who do, I think, can never have known him personally.  In all our association of twenty years I never saw him show temper, he controlled his irritations and impatiences as a gentleman should. He was always kindness itself to me...." </ref> During the final illness of the theatre critic [[Clement Scott]] in 1904, for instance, Gilbert visited nearly every day and assisted Scott's wife.<ref>Scott, Mrs. Clement (c1910). Old Days in Bohemian London. New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company. pp. 71-72.</ref>  Similarly, Gilbert had written some plays at the behest of comic actor Ned Sothern, including ''Foggerty<U+2019>s Fairy''.  However, Sothern died before he could perform the piece.  Gilbert purchased the play back from the grateful legatee.<ref>See, e.g., Ainger, Michael (2002). ''Gilbert and Sullivan <U+2013> A Dual Biography'', pp. 193-94.</ref>  In addition, as the writings about Gilbert by husband and wife [[Seymour Hicks]] and [[Ellaline Terriss]] (frequent guests at his home), vividly illustrate, Gilbert's relationships with women were generally more successful than his relationships with men.<ref name=HicksTerriss />

Gilbert was knighted in 1907 in recognition of his contributions to drama.  Sullivan had been knighted for his contributions to music almost a quarter of a century earlier, in 1883.  Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a [[knighthood]] for his plays alone&mdash;earlier dramatist knights, such as [[Sir William Davenant]] and [[Sir John Vanbrugh]], were knighted for political and other services.<ref>Stedman (1996), p. 328.</ref>

On [[29 May]] [[1911]], Gilbert was giving swimming lessons to two young ladies in the lake of his home [[Grim's Ditch (Harrow)|Grim's Dyke]] when one of them lost her footing and called for help.  Gilbert dived in to save her, but suffered a heart attack in the middle of the lake and drowned.<ref name="CrowtherLife">Crowther, Andrew, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/html/gilbert_l.html ''The Life of W. S. Gilbert'']</ref>

He was buried in a cemetery in [[Stanmore]].
