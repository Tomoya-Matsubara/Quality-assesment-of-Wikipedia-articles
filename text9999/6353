{{Culture of Bengal}}
Kolkata has long been known for its literary, artistic and revolutionary heritage. As the former capital of India, Kolkata was the birthplace of modern Indian literary, artistic and scholastic thought. Kolkatans tend to have a special appreciation for art and literature; its tradition of welcoming new talent has made it a "city of furious creative energy".<ref name=sinha>{{

== Para, Adda, and "club" culture ==

[[Para]]s in Kolkata signify a neighbourhood with a strong sense of community, and are usually sharply defined on the basis of loyalties (like which households contribute economically to which public or "[[barowari]]" [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). [[Para]]s culture typically segregate Kolkata communities on the basis of origin (West Bengal origin  "[[ghotis]]" versus East Bengal origin "[[bangal]]s" - there are [[para]]s which have names like "prothom bangal para" (first bangal para)), occupation and socio-economic status (paras have names like "kumorpara" (potter para)), and sometimes even politics and religion. 

Typically, every [[para]] has its own community club, with a club room ("club ghar"), and often a playing field. People of a [[para]] habitually indulge in [[adda]] or leisurely chat in "rock"s or "rowacks" (porches) and teashops in the evenings after work. North Kolkata [[para]]s typically have more street life at late nights with respect to South Kolkata [[para]]s. Sports ([[cricket]], [[football (soccer)|football]], [[badminton]]) and indoor games ([[carrom]]) tournaments are regularly organized on an inter-para basis. 

The [[para]] culture is fast waning, for good or bad, with the rise of apartment complexes, and the rise of the cosmopolitan nature of Kolkata.

An [[adda]] involves an informal discussion usually involving friends talking over a ''bhaar''(cup) of tea on current issues. An ''adda''  may be viewed as  a form of intellectual exchange among members of the same socio-economic strata. It is most popular among the youths belonging to the so-called "middle-class intelligentsia".

== Graffiti ==
Graffiti was used not for vandalism, or counterculture art, but mainly for political propaganda. Walls were "captured" for fixed numbers of years, and graffiti over-painting was tantamount to political transgression. Generations of political graffiti artists have been at work on Kolkata's walls, producing slander, witty banter and limericks, caricatures and propaganda. However, such acts being clear cases of defacing private property, the [[Calcutta High Court]] ruled to ban political graffiti from private properties without express consent of the property owner. Graffiti lives on in "club" walls, unclaimed property walls, and the occasional flouting of the order.
Graffiti artists have become a part of Kolktata's heritage. Many house owners now welcome them to paint on their walls so that these are not captured by political parties. Social messages like AIDS awareness, environmental issues etc., are now getting more popularity.

== Traffic and commuter culture ==
Calcuttans are aggressive commuters, but with a sense of humour. The local and suburban rails and buses, as well as the underground [[Kolkata Metro]] railway are usually packed during office hours. The practice of "reserving" public seats by daily passengers is widespread. [[Share taxi]]s are a common occurrence for travel to and from railway stations and such. The practice of [[car pool]]s is also growing after the construction of the [[Eastern Metropolitan Bypass]] and the emergence of the CBD in [[Bidhan Nagar]].

Another phenomenon of Kolkata traffic is the Auto-rikshaws. Auto-rikshaws or autos as they are acronymed are small contraptions on the roads. They have three wheels, and are extremely agile. The regulation is three passengers at back, one in front along with the driver. This regulation is disregarded with impunity and often six or more people get in. Autos ply on fixed routes and the fare ranges from Rs.4 to Rs. 15, depending on the distance covered.

== Cinema ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kolkatanandan.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Entrance of [[Nandan]] cinema complex]] -->
While [[Mumbai]] is the capital of commercial cinemas in India, Kolkata is the house of art-films. Stallwarts like [[Satyajit Ray]],  [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Mrinal Sen]] are the pride of Kolkata. The biggest event of Indian cinema was the release of ''[[Pather Panchali]]''  in 1955 made by [[Satyajit Ray]] based on a novel of Bibhutibhusan Banerjee. This film connected Indian film to the rest of the world. The movie was acclaimed throughout the world specially in the Western world as a symbol of undying human spirit. Presently, [[Aparna Sen]], [[Budhdhadeb Dasgupta]], [[Gautam Ghose]], [[Rituparno Ghosh]] are bearing the mantle of the great tradition. [[Kolkata Film Festival]], held annually across several cinema theatres in the city serves to the taste of Kolkata people for cinema from all over the world. [[Nandan]] is a popular cinema complex in the premiers of [[Rabindra Sadan]], maintained by the state government. This theater complex holds regular shows of national and international cinema.[[File:Satyajit Ray.jpg|left|thumb|[[Satyajit Ray]]]]

In 1897, films were shown for the first time in Calcutta. Couple of years later, Hiralal Sen from north Calcutta started making films at the Classic Theatres. In 1901, Hiralal Sen set up Royal Bioscope, produced scenes and dance sequences from popular Bengali plays. The first Bengali movie was "Billwamangal" in 1919 which happened to be a silent movie. The first Bengali talkie, Dena Paona was released in 1931, directed by Premankur Atarthi and produced by New Theatres. The first popular hero in Bengali film was probably Pramathesh Barua, who was a director himself too.
 
The commercial Bengali cinema industry, known as "Tollywood", is based in [[Tollygunge]] locality of the city. Several film studios are located here. Though the popularity of the commercial Bengali cinemas has dwindled in the urban area, they continue to be popular in the rural West Bengal. The golden age of commercial Bengali cinema is said to be 1950-1970 and involved actors such as [[Uttam Kumar]], [[Soumitra Chatterjee]], [[Utpal Dutta]], [[Suchitra Sen]], Chobi Biswas, Sabitri Chottopadhya, Pahari Sanyal, Bikash Roy. [[Suchitra Sen]] received best actress award in [[Moscow Film Festival]] for her role in ''Saat Paake Badha'' co-starring [[Soumitra Chatterjee]].

== Literature ==
[[Image:Tagore3.jpg|thumb|200px|Rabindranath Tagore in [[Kolkata]], First Asian Nobel-Laurete (probably taken in 1915, the year he was knighted by [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]]).]]
Bengali prose became modern courtesy of [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]. The doyens of nineteenth century Bengali literature like [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] were from Kolkata. As the then cultural capital of India, Kolkata based literature affected and shaped the thought and culture of many Indians. [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was an author whose specialty was exploring complex human psychology, especially that of female mind. [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was one of the earliest Bengali novelists and is popularly known as the author of India's first national song, "Bande M<U+0101>tarom" (pronounced in Hindi "Vande M<U+0101>t<U+0101>ram"). [[Tarashankar Bandopadhyay]] was another famous novelist whose works feature a realistic picture of the many-colored fabric of life in rural Bengal. The Kolkata litt<U+00E9>rateurs still borrow a lot from Tagore. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1950s, a new breed of Bengali writers and poets came into being in Kolkata exemplified by [[Jibanananda Das]], [[Sukanta Bhattacharya]], [[Bishnu Dey]], [[Premendra Mitra]], [[Buddhadeb Guha]] etc. They wanted to break free from the traditional [[mysticism]] and [[surrealism]] of Tagore style and present various concepts such as [[modernism]], [[post-modernism]], [[cubism]] through their writings. [[Satyajit Ray]] was also a  writer, especially for children. Other literary figures include [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]], [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], [[Samaresh Majumdar]], [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]], [[Shankha Ghosh]], [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Nirad Chaudhuri]], [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]], [[Mahasweta Devi]], [[Joy Goswami]], [[Mani Shankar Mukherjee]],  etc.

The most important counter-cultural activity in post-Independence West Bengal has been the [[Hungry Generation|Hungryalist Movement]], known also as [[Hungry Generation]] spearheaded by the two outsider brothers [[Samir Roychoudhury]] and [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], who are today cultural cult-figures among Bengali Intellectual diaspora.

Kolkata's proud presentation of the new forms of Prakalpana fiction and Sarbangin poetry, contrived by [[Vattacharja Chandan]] and projected by [[Prakalpana Movement]], appears to be the only ongoing Indian [[avant garde]] [[literary movement]] that has been buzzing globally for over four decades.<ref>''Songs of kobisena'' in ''Version 90'' by Steve LeBlanc, PMS Cafe Press, Alston, MS, USA,</ref>

The [[Calcutta Book Fair]] is an annual fair showcasing books published by the regional, national and international publishers. Started in 1976, the book fair projects every year a particular country as the theme of the year. There is a separate area dedicated for the [[little magazine]]s.

== Dramas and theatres ==

== Cuisine ==
{{Main|Bengali cuisine}}
Key elements of Kolkata's cuisine include rice and ''macher jhol'' (fish curry), with [[Rasgulla]] as dessert. Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes include various ''eelish''([[hilsa]]) preparations (a favourite among Bengalis) like ''eelish shorshe bata'', ''eelish bhap'' and ''eelish-er paturi'' . Street foods like rolls (mutton roll, egg roll, chicken roll, and sometimes in the Park Circus region - beef roll) and [[phuchka]] are very popular. Phuchka (called golgappa in North India, and panipuri in West India) is a deep-fried whole-wheat hollow crispy ball which is filled with spicy potato filling and spicy, herbed tamarind water when serving. Common accompaniments to Phuchka are things dishes like Churmur, Ghugni. A Bengali meal is incomplete without sweets. Popular sweets include [[Rasgulla|Roshogolla]], [[mishti doi]] (sweet curd), [[langcha]], Kheerkadam, [[sandesh (sweet)|sandesh]], [[rajbhog]], [[Rasgulla#Derivatives|Kamalabhog]], etc.

One common feature of Kolkata cuisine today originates from Tibetan regions - momo and thuppa. The Elgin Road offshoots have a lot of outlets specialising in the delicious steamed dumplings (pork, chicken, vegetarian) called momos - typically served with a clear stalk soup and often served with spicy chutneys. Thuppa is a common accompaniment - a clear soup with noodles, vegetables and other herbs. Due to the high popularity, momos are now available all over the city, and are even served as street food at some places.
