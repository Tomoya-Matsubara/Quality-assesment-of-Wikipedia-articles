==Education and career==

Juan S<U+00E1>nchez Pel<U+00E1>ez was born in Altagracia de Orituco but his family soon moved to Caracas, where he attended primary and secondary schools. He attended university in Santiago, [[Chile]] where he befriended the poets of the surrealist group Mandr<U+00E1>gora. He published his first poems in their magazine and it was through this encounter that his lifelong interest in surrealism began. Upon returning to Caracas, he published ''Elena y los elementos'' in 1951. ''Elena y los elementos'' had a profound effect on Venezuelan poetry, outlining a distinctly Venezuelan form of surrealism that influenced the generation of avant-garde poets who emerged in the 1960s. This book was published in a fiftieth anniversary edition by Monte <U+00C1>vila Editores after he was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the Universidad de los Andes in M<U+00E9>rida in 2001.<ref name="Montejo" />

He worked as a teacher in [[Matur<U+00ED>n]], [[Maracaibo]] and the state of [[Sucre, Venezuela|Sucre]]. He was cultural attache to the Embassy of Venezuela in [[Colombia]]. He also lived in [[Paris]]<ref name="Montejo" /> and Madrid.<ref name="Montejo" /> In 1969 he was a Fellow at The University of Iowa<U+2019>s International Writing Program, after which he lived in New York City for two years. S<U+00E1>nchez Pel<U+00E1>ez was a contributor to numerous periodicals: Papel Literario ([[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]), [[Zona Franca (Barcelona)|Zona Franca]], Eco (Colombia) Revista Poesia (Valencia), Se<U+00F1>al (Paris), Tabla Redonda, among others.

The outstanding feature of his poetry is the tension between mysticism and eroticism.<ref name=Montejo>{{cite news|last=Montejo|first=Eugenio|title=Adi<U+00F3>s a Juan S<U+00E1>nchez Pel<U+00E1>ez|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/revista/letrillas/adios-juan-sanchez-pelaez|accessdate=21 June 2012|newspaper=Letras Libres|date=February 2004}}</ref> S<U+00E1>nchez Pel<U+00E1>ez always looked at his erotic objects as distant entities, separate from the mundane through the metaphysical veil. Ludovico Silva, in his "Juan Sanchez Pelaez, The real and illusionary" states:

<blockquote>''Juan S<U+00E1>nchez Pel<U+00E1>ez was the first Venezuelan poet who introduced into our poetry, consciousness of the secrecy of man in the world and his distressing certainty of being thrown into time as a foreigner, without his consent (...) His existential rebellion is a discerning attitude, a lyrical excitement, a ritual of introspection. Silent. He accepts the world but does not understand it and his flexible language, capable of expressing nuances of a visionary and deeply artistic sensibility, constitutes a renewal.''<ref>Escritura, Numero 01, Caracas, Junio 1976, pp.78</ref></blockquote>

Juan Liscano, in his ''Panorama de la Literatura actual'' (Overview of Current Literature), 1973, states: "S<U+00E1>nchez Pel<U+00E1>ez through his open writing and his existential attitude created a new path in our poetry".
