The '''Battle of Midway''' was a [[naval battle]] in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]].
It took place from [[June 4]], [[1942]] to [[June 7]], [[1942]], approximately one month after the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], about five months after the Japanese capture of [[Wake Island]], and six months after the [[Empire of Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that had led to a formal state of war between the [[United States]] and Japan.
During the battle, the [[United States Navy]] defeated a Japanese attack against [[Midway Atoll]], losing one [[aircraft carrier]] and one [[destroyer]], while destroying four Japanese carriers and a [[heavy cruiser]].

The battle was a [[decisive victory]] for the Americans, widely regarded as the most important naval engagement of the Pacific Campaign of World War II.<ref name="Midway Decisive">{{cite web | last =  | first = year = 2007 | url = http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/midway.html | title = A Brief History of Aircraft Carriers: Battle of Midway | format = | work = | publisher = U.S. Navy | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> 
The battle permanently weakened the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), particularly through the loss of over 200 naval aviators.<ref>Dull, ''The Imperial Japanese Navy: A Battle History,'' p. 166; Willmott, ''The Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp. 519<U+2013>523; Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'' p. 395; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416<U+2013>430.</ref>
Both nations sustained losses in the battle, but Japan,  industrially outstripped by America, was unable to reconstitute its naval forces while the American shipbuilding program provided quick replacements. By 1942 the United States was three years{{Fact|date=October 2007}}<!--Vinson Act? 2-Ocean Navy Act?--> into a massive ship building program that sought to expand the Navy to a size superior to Japan's. As a result of Midway, the Japanese were faced with naval inferiority within months as this created a steady flow of aircraft carriers and other ships of the line. Strategically, the [[U.S. Navy]] was able to seize the initiative in the Pacific and go on the offensive.

The Japanese plan of attack was to lure America's remaining carriers into a trap and sink them.<ref>H.P. Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; Lundstrom, ''First South Pacific Campaign''; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 19<U+2013>38.</ref> The Japanese also intended to occupy Midway Atoll to extend Japan's defensive perimeter farther from its home islands. This operation was considered preparatory for further attacks against [[Fiji]] and [[Samoa]], as well as an invasion of [[Hawaii (state)|Hawaii]].<ref>For a detailed discussion of anticipated follow-on Hawaiian operations, see Parshall & Tully, pp. 43<U+2013>45, & Stephan, ''Hawaii under the Rising Sun''.</ref> 

The Midway operation, like the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], was not part of a campaign for the conquest of the United States, but was aimed at its elimination as a strategic Pacific power, thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. It was also hoped another defeat would force the U.S. to negotiate an end to the [[Pacific War]] with conditions favorable for Japan.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 33; Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''.</ref>

==Strategic context==
Japan had been highly successful in rapidly securing its initial war goals, including the takeover of the [[Philippines]], capture of [[Malaya]] and [[Singapore]], and securing vital resource areas in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Borneo]], and other islands of  the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). As such, preliminary planning for a second phase of operations commenced as early as January 1942. However, because of strategic differences between the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] and Imperial Navy, as well as infighting between the Navy's [[Imperial General Headquarters|GHQ]] and [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]<U+2019>s [[Combined Fleet]], the formulation of effective strategy was hampered, and the follow-up strategy was not finalized until April 1942.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 13<U+2013>15, 21<U+2013>23; Willmott, ''The Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp. 39<U+2013>49; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 22<U+2013>38.</ref> Admiral Yamamoto succeeded in winning a bureaucratic struggle placing his operational concept <U+2014> further operations in the South Pacific <U+2014> ahead of other contending plans. These included operations either directly or indirectly aimed at [[Australia]] and into the [[Indian Ocean]]. In the end, Yamamoto's barely-veiled threat to resign unless he got his way succeeded in carrying his agenda forward.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 33; Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', p. 23.</ref>

Yamamoto's primary strategic concern was the elimination of America's remaining carrier forces. This concern was acutely heightened by the [[Doolittle Raid]] on [[Tokyo]] ([[April 18]] [[1942]]) by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25s]], launching from [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']]. The raid, while militarily insignificant, was a severe [[psychological operations|psychological]] [[shock and awe|shock]] to the Japanese and proved the existence of a gap in the defenses around the Japanese home islands.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 22<U+2013>26. One wonders what the Japanese thought the presence of Amercian submarines off their coast, beginning with Joe Grenfell's [[USS Gudgeon (SS-211)|''Gudgeon'']] some twenty days after Pearl Harbor, represented; in light of how poor IJN ASW training and doctrine was, perhaps it should be no surprise this was ignored. Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.110; Parillo, ''Japanese Merchant Marine''; Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''.</ref> Sinking America's aircraft carriers and seizing Midway, the only strategic island besides Hawaii in the East Pacific, was seen as the only means of nullifying this threat. Yamamoto reasoned an operation against the main carrier base at [[Pearl Harbor]] would induce the U.S. forces to fight. However, given the strength of American land-based airpower on Hawaii, he judged the powerful American base could not be attacked directly.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 33.</ref> Instead, he selected Midway, at the extreme northwest end of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Island]] chain, some 1,300&nbsp;miles (2,100&nbsp;km) from [[Oahu]]. Midway was not especially important in the larger scheme of Japan's intentions; however, the Japanese felt the Americans would consider Midway a vital outpost of Pearl Harbor and would therefore strongly defend it.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp. 66<U+2013>67; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 33<U+2013>34.</ref> The U.S. ''did'' consider Midway vital; after the battle, establishment of a U.S. [[submarine]] base on Midway extended submarine range 2,400&nbsp;miles (4,400&nbsp;km). An airstrip on Midway served as a forward staging point for bomber attacks on [[Wake Island]].<ref>http://www.fws.gov/midway/past/postwar.html</ref>

===Yamamoto's plan===
[[Image:Midway Atoll.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|A picture of Midway Atoll, taken several months before the battle.]]

Typical of Japanese naval planning during the Second World War, Yamamoto's battle plan was quite complex.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' pp. 375<U+2013>379, Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin'', pp. 110<U+2013>117; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 52.</ref> Additionally, his designs were predicated on optimistic intelligence information suggesting [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'']] and [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']], forming Task Force 16, were the only carriers available to the U.S. Pacific Fleet at the time. [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] had been sunk and [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'']] severely damaged (and believed sunk) at the Battle of the Coral Sea just a month earlier. Likewise, the Japanese were aware [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'']] was undergoing repairs on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] after taking torpedo damage from a submarine. As such, the Japanese believed they faced at most two American fleet carriers at the point of contact.

More important, however, was Yamamoto's belief the Americans had been demoralized by their frequent defeats during the preceding six months. Yamamoto felt deception would be required to lure the U.S. Fleet into a fatally compromising situation.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 53, derived from Japanese War History Series (''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>''), Volume 43 ('Midowei Kaisen'), p. 118.</ref> To this end, he dispersed his forces so that their full extent (particularly his [[battleship]]s) would be unlikely to be discovered by the Americans prior to battle. However, his emphasis on dispersal meant none of his formations were mutually supporting. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, any benefit from this was neutralized by the fact the United States had broken the main Japanese naval code (dubbed [[JN-25]] by the U.S.).

Critically, Yamamoto's supporting battleships and cruisers would trail Vice-Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]'s carrier striking force by several hundred miles. Japan's heavy surface forces were intended to destroy whatever part of the U.S. Fleet might come to Midway's relief, once Nagumo's carriers had weakened them sufficiently for a daylight gun duel to be fought;<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 51, 55.</ref> this was typical of the battle doctrine of most major navies. However, their distance from Nagumo's carriers would have grave implications during the battle, since the battleships were escorted by [[cruiser]]s, which possessed [[scout plane]]s invaluable to Nagumo.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref>

===Aleutian invasion===
Likewise, the [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|Japanese operations aimed at the Aleutian Islands]] (Operation AL) removed yet more ships from the force striking Midway. However, whereas prior histories of the battle have often characterized the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces northwards, recent scholarship on the battle has shown, by the original Japanese battle plan, AL was designed to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 43<U+2013>45, derived from ''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', p. 196.</ref> However, a one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force had the effect of initiating Operation AL a day before its counterpart.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 43<U+2013>45, derived from ''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', pp. 119<U+2013>121.</ref>

==Prelude to battle==
===U.S. forces===
[[Image:G13065 USS Yorktown Pearl Harbor May 1942.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|[[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'']] at [[Pearl Harbor]] days before the battle.]]

In order to do battle with an enemy force anticipated to be composed of 4 or 5 carriers, Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every available U.S. flight deck. He already had [[Vice Admiral]] [[William Halsey]]'s two-carrier [[task force]] at hand <U+2014> but Halsey was stricken with [[psoriasis]] and had to be replaced with [[Rear Admiral]] [[Raymond A. Spruance]] (Halsey's escort commander).<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 80<U+2013>81; Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History,'' p. 37.</ref> Nimitz also hurriedly called back Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]]'s task force from the [[South West Pacific Area]]. He reached Pearl Harbor just in time to provision and sail. ''Saratoga'' was still under repair, and ''Yorktown'' had been severely damaged at the Battle of the Coral Sea, but [[Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard]] worked around the clock to patch up the carrier. Though several months of repairs at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] was estimated for ''Yorktown'', 72&nbsp;hours was enough to restore her to a battle-worthy (if still not structurally ideal) state.<ref>Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History'', pp. 37<U+2013>45; Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', pp. 37<U+2013>39.</ref> Her flight deck was patched, whole sections of internal beams were cut out and replaced, and several new squadrons (drawn from the ''Saratoga'') were put aboard. Nimitz showed disregard for established procedure in getting his third and last available carrier ready for battle <U+2014> repairs continued even as ''Yorktown'' sortied, with work crews from the repair ship [[USS Vestal (AR-4)|USS ''Vestal'']]&mdash;herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier&mdash;still aboard. Just three days after putting into drydock at Pearl Harbor, ''Yorktown'' was again under steam, as the ship's band played "[[California, Here I Come]]"<ref>Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', p. 39.</ref>

===Japanese forces===

Meanwhile, as a result of their participation in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] was in port in [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], awaiting a replacement air group. The heavily damaged [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh<U+014D>kaku|''Sh<U+014D>kaku'']] was under repair from three bomb hits suffered at Coral Sea, and required months in drydock. Despite the likely availability of sufficient aircraft between the two ships to re-equip ''Zuikaku'' with a composite air group, the Japanese made no serious attempt to get her into the forthcoming battle.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 65<U+2013>67.</ref> Consequently, instead of bringing five intact fleet carriers into battle, Admiral Nagumo would only have four: [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']], with [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], forming Division 1; [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry<U+016B>|''Hiry<U+016B>'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>|''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'']], as the 2nd Division. At least part of this was a product of fatigue; Japanese carriers had been constantly on operations since [[December 7]], [[1941]], including pinprick raids on [[Bombing of Darwin (February 1942)|Darwin]] and [[Indian Ocean raid|Colombo]].

Japanese strategic scouting arrangements prior to the battle also fell into disarray. A picket line of Japanese [[submarine]]s was late getting into position (partly because of Yamamoto's haste), which let the American carriers proceed to their assembly point northeast of Midway (known as "Point Luck") without being detected.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin,'' p. 351; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 98<U+2013>99.</ref> A second attempt to use four-engine reconnaissance [[flying boat]]s to scout Pearl Harbor prior to the battle (and thereby detect the absence or presence of the American carriers), known as "Operation K", was also thwarted when Japanese submarines assigned to refuel the search aircraft discovered the intended refueling point <U+2014> a hitherto deserted bay off [[French Frigate Shoals]] <U+2014> was occupied by American warships (because the Japanese had carried out an identical mission in March).<ref>Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', pp. 37<U+2013>39; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 99; Holmes, ''Double-Edged Secrets''.</ref> Thus, Japan was deprived of any knowledge concerning the movements of the American carriers immediately before the battle. Japanese radio intercepts also noticed an increase in both American submarine activity and U.S. message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. However, Japanese plans were not changed in reaction to this; Yamamoto, at sea in [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], did not dare inform Nagumo without exposing his position, and presumed (incorrectly) Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 102<U+2013>104; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref>

===American and British code-breaking===
Admiral Nimitz had one priceless asset: American and British [http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/JapCDSCH1.html] cryptanalysts had broken the [[Japanese naval codes#JN-25|JN-25]] code. Commander [[Joseph J. Rochefort]] and his team at [[Station Hypo|<small>HYPO</small>]] were able to confirm Midway as the target of the impending Japanese strike, to determine the date of the attack as either 4 or 5 June (as opposed to mid-June, maintained by Washington), and to provide Nimitz with a complete IJN [[order of battle]]. Japan's efforts to introduce a new codebook had been delayed, giving <small>HYPO</small> several crucial days; while it  was blacked out shortly before the attack began, the important breaks had already been made.<ref>Holmes, ''Double-Edged Secrets''; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''. There are occasional ignorant references to "deception", notably in the film [[Midway (film)|"Midway"]], referring to the false traffic before [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]; this reflects a complete misunderstanding of the issue.</ref>

As a result, the Americans entered the battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what strength the Japanese would appear. Nimitz was aware, for example, the vast numerical superiority of the Japanese fleet had been divided into no less than four task forces, and the escort for the main Carrier Striking Force was limited to just a few fast ships. For this reason, they knew the [[anti-aircraft guns]] protecting the carriers would be limited. Knowing the strength he faced, Nimitz calculated his three carrier decks, plus Midway, to Yamamoto's four, gave the U.S. rough parity. (It is also true American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones.) The Japanese, by contrast, remained almost totally in the dark about their opponents even after the battle began.<ref>Lord, ''Incredible Victory''; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''; Layton, ''And I Was There: Pearl Harbor and Midway <U+2014> Breaking the Secrets''. </ref>

==Battle==
===Initial air attacks===
<!--[[Image:G17056 Oil tanks burn at Midway after Japanese attack 4 june 1942.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|The Japanese attack on Midway at 06:20 on June 4.]]-->
Vice Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]] launched his initial attack wave of 108 aircraft at 04:30 on [[June 4]]. At the same time, he launched eight search aircraft (one 30 minutes late, and one which turned back), as well as [[combat air patrol]] (CAP) fighters. 

Japanese reconnaissance arrangements were flimsy, with too few aircraft to adequately cover the assigned search areas, laboring under poor weather conditions to the northeast and east of the task force.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 107<U+2013>112; 132<U+2013>133.</ref> Now, Yamamoto's faulty dispositions came home to roost.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier''.</ref>

At 06:20, Japanese carrier [[aircraft]] bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base on Midway. Midway-based Marine fighter pilots, flying obsolescent [[Grumman Aircraft|Grumman]] [[F4F Wildcat]]s and obsolete [[Brewster Buffalo|Brewster F2A]]s, made a defense of Midway and suffered heavy losses. American anti-aircraft fire was accurate and intense, damaging many Japanese aircraft.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 200<U+2013>204.</ref> The Japanese mission recognized the island's strike aircraft had already departed. The Japanese strike leader signaled Nagumo another mission would be necessary to neutralize Midway's defenses before troops could be landed on [[June 7]].<ref> Lord, ''Incredible Victory'', p. 110; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 149.</ref> 

Having taken off prior to the Japanese attack, American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet. These included six [[TBF Avenger]]s in their first combat operation, and four [[B-26 Marauder]]s (armed with torpedoes). The Japanese shrugged off these attacks with almost no losses, while destroying all but three of the American bombers.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 207<U+2013>212; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 149<U+2013>152.</ref>

[[Image:Hiryu f075712.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|''Hiryu'' avoiding B-17 attack.]]
Admiral Nagumo, in accordance with Japanese carrier [[military doctrine|doctrine]] at the time, had kept half of his aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of dive-bombers and torpedo bombers. The latter were armed with torpedoes for an antiship strike, should any American warships be located. The dive bombers were, as yet, unarmed.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 130<U+2013>132.</ref> As a result of the attacks from Midway, as well as the morning flight leader's recommendation regarding the need for a second strike, Nagumo at 07:15 ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with general purpose contact bombs for use on land targets. This had been underway for about 30 minutes, when at 07:40 a scout plane from the [[cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Tone|''Tone'']] signaled the discovery of a sizable American naval force to the east. Nagumo quickly reversed his order and demanded the scout plane ascertain the composition of the American force. Another 40 minutes elapsed before ''Tone'''s scout finally detected and radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force, [[Task Force 16|TF 16]] (the other carrier was not detected).<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 216<U+2013>217; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 159<U+2013>161, 183.</ref>

Nagumo was now in a quandary. Rear Admiral [[Tamon Yamaguchi]], leading Carrier Division 2 (''Hiry<U+016B>'' and ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>''), recommended Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand. Nagumo's seeming opportunity to hit the American ships,<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 165<U+2013>170.</ref> however, was curtailed by the fact his Midway strike force would be returning shortly. They would be low on fuel and carrying wounded crewmen, would need to land promptly or ditch, losing precious aircraft and crews; there was slim chance a strike could be mounted in time. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would require at least 30<U+2013>45 minutes.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 121<U+2013>124.</ref> Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, he would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper antiship armament, as well as without fighter escort; they had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers were shot down by their own fighters <ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' p. 233.</ref>. Japanese carrier doctrine preferred fully constituted strikes, and in the absence of a confirmation (until 08:20) of whether the American force contained carriers, Nagumo's reaction was cautious.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' pp. 217<U+2013>218, 372<U+2013>373; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 170<U+2013>173.</ref> In addition, the impending arrival of another American air strike at 07:53 gave weight to the need to attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo chose to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve strike force, which would have by then been properly armed and ready.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 231<U+2013>237; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 170<U+2013>173; Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway''.</ref> In the final analysis, it made no difference; Fletcher had launched beginning at 07:00, so the aircraft which would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. There was nothing Nagumo could do about it. This was, perhaps, the fatal flaw of Yamamoto's dispositions: it followed strictly traditional battleship [[doctrine]].<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier & the Javelin''; Fuchida & Okumiya, ''Midway''.</ref>

===Attacks on the Japanese fleet===
[[Image:VT-6TBDs.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|[[TBD Devastator|TBD]]s of VT-6 during the battle.]]
[[Image:Vt8-g-gay-may42.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] [[George H. Gay, Jr.|George Gay]] (right), sole survivor of VT-8, in front of his [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]] [[TBD Devastator]], 4 June 1942.]]

Meanwhile, the Americans had already launched their carrier aircraft against the Japanese. Admiral Fletcher, in overall command aboard ''Yorktown'', and armed with [[PBY Catalina|PBY]] sighting reports from the early morning,<ref>Relayed ''via'' Nimitz who, unlike Yamamoto, had remained ashore.</ref> ordered Spruance to launch against the Japanese as soon as was practical.  Spruance gave the order "Launch the attack" at around 06:00 and left Halsey's Chief of Staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]] to work out the details and oversee the launch. It took until a few minutes after 07:00 before the first plane was able to depart from Spruance's carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet.'' Fletcher, upon completing his own scouting flights, followed suit at 08:00 from ''Yorktown''.<ref>Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History,'' pp. 84<U+2013>89; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 215<U+2013>216; 226<U+2013>227; Buehl, ''The Quiet Warrior'' (1987), p. 494ff.</ref>

However, American flight deck operations were not nearly as proficient as the enemy's at this point in the war, and the first-launched planes waited aloft for over a half hour for the rest of the planes to leave the flight deck. They were burning fuel and still had to fly to a target at the edge of their range.  It was at this point Spruance gave his second crucial command, to run toward the target, having judged the need to throw something at the enemy as soon as possible was greater than the need for a coordinated attack among the different types of aircraft (fighters, bombers, torpedo planes). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched in piecemeal fashion, proceeding to the target in several different groups. This diminished the overall impact of the American attacks and greatly increased their casualties; coincidentally, it reduced the Japanese ability to counterstrike and found Nagumo with his decks at their most vulnerable.

American carrier aircraft had difficulty locating the target in the vastness of the Pacific, despite the positions they had been given. Nevertheless, they did finally sight enemy carriers and began attacking at 09:20, led by Torpedo Squadron 8 ([[VT-8]], from ''Hornet''), followed by [[VT-6]] (from ''Enterprise'') at 09:40.<ref>Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History'', pp. 91<U+2013>94.</ref> Every TBD of VT-8 was shot down, with only one survivor. VT-6 met nearly the same fate, with no hits against the enemy to show for their efforts, thanks in part to terrible aircraft torpedoes.<ref>Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory''. (Lippincott, 1975), p.238.</ref> The Japanese CAP, flying the much faster [[Mitsubishi Zero]], made short work of the Americans who not only had no fighter support of their own but were flying the slow, under-armed TBDs. However, despite their losses, the American torpedo planes indirectly achieved three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance, with no ability to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, their attacks had pulled the Japanese combat air patrol out of position <U+2014> not in terms of altitude (as has commonly been described), but by laterally distorting the CAP coverage over the Japanese fleet{{Fact|date=September 2007}}. Third, many of the Zeros were low on ammunition and fuel.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 215<U+2013>216; 226<U+2013>227.</ref> The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by [[VT-3]] at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP into the southeast quadrant of the fleet.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 226<U+2013>227.</ref>

By chance, at the same time VT-3 was sighted by the Japanese, two separate formations (comprising three squadrons total) of American [[SBD Dauntless]] dive-bombers were approaching the Japanese fleet from the northeast and southwest. These formations initially had difficulty in locating the Japanese carriers, and their fuel was running low. However, by the decisions of squadron commanders [[C. Wade McClusky, Jr.]] and [[Max Leslie]] to continue the search, they spotted the wake of Japanese destroyer ''Arashi''. The destroyer was steaming at full speed back to Nagumo's carrier force, after having unsuccessfully [[depth-charge]]d the U.S. submarine [[Ships named Nautilus#Second military submarine USS Nautilus .28SS-168.29 1930|''Nautilus'']] (SS-168), which had earlier carried out an unsuccessful attack on the [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|battleship ''Kirishima'']].<ref name="kirishimamove">{{cite web | last =  | first = year = 2006 | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kirishima.html | title = IJN KIRISHIMA: Tabular Record of Movement | format = | work = Senkan! | publisher = combinedfleet.com | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> The American dive-bombers arrived in a perfect position to attack the Japanese.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway'', pp. 259<U+2013>261, 267<U+2013>269; Cressman ''et al.'', ''A Glorious Page in Our History,'' pp. 96<U+2013>97; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 215<U+2013>216; 226<U+2013>227.</ref> Armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks at the time of the fateful attack, fuel hoses were snaking across the decks as refueling operations were hastily completed, and the constant change of ordnance meant bombs and torpedoes were stacked around the hangars rather than stowed safely in the magazines.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 250.</ref> The Japanese carriers were extraordinarily vulnerable.

Contrary to some accounts of the battle, recent research, based on recent translation of relevant portions of the 100 volume Japanese account of the war, ''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', has demonstrated the Japanese were not in fact prepared to launch a counterstrike against the Americans at the time they were decisively attacked.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 229<U+2013>231. Derived from ''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', Volume 43, pp. 372<U+2013>378, and the tabulated air group records (''k<U+014D>d<U+014D>ch<U+014D>sho'') of the Japanese carriers contained in "Midway Operation: DesRon 10, Mine Sweep Div 16, CV Akagi, CV Kaga, CVL S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>, and CVL Hiry<U+016B>." Extract Translation from DOC No.160985B<U+2014>MC 397.901.</ref> Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese had never had an opportunity to spot their reserve strike force for launch. The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either CAP fighters, or (in the case of ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'') strike fighters being spotted to augment the CAP.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 231, derived from ''Senshi S<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', pp. 372<U+2013>378.</ref>  Regardless, the moment of opportunity was exploited for all it was worth by the American bomber pilots.

Beginning at 10:22, ''Enterprise''<U+2019>s aircraft attacked ''Kaga'', while to the south, ''Yorktown''<U+2019>s aircraft attacked carrier ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'', with ''Akagi'' being struck by several of ''Enterprise'''s bombers four minutes later. Simultaneously, VT-3 was targeting ''Hiry<U+016B>'', although the American torpedo aircraft again scored no hits. The dive-bombers, however, had better fortune. Within six minutes, the SBDs made their attack runs and left all three of their targets heavily ablaze. ''Akagi'' was hit by just one bomb, which was sufficient; it penetrated to the upper hangar deck and exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft there. One extremely near miss also slanted in and exploded underwater, bending the flight deck upward with the resulting geyser and causing crucial rudder damage.<ref>Other sources claim a stern hit, but ''Shattered Sword'', p. 253<U+2013>354; 256<U+2013>259 makes a case for a water burst, because of rudder damage from a high explosive bomb. </ref> ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' took three bomb hits in the hangar decks; ''Kaga'' took at least four, possibly more.  All three carriers were out of action and would eventually be abandoned and scuttled.<ref>Recent scholarship has shown all four were scuttled. Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 330<U+2013>353.</ref>

By proceeding to target directly, without waiting for fighter escort, the torpedo squadrons, one after one, at low level, engaged enemy combat air patrol. This created an opportunity for the pilots of the dive bombers, who had arrived high above the action and were able to dive on target before being attacked.  The torpedo planes were shot down and the torpedo squadron pilots lost their lives, but they enabled a titanic victory.

Subsequent to the air attacks, ''Nautilus'' fired torpedoes at what her crew thought was ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' but which later research suggests was ''Kaga.'' ''Nautilus'' claimed one hit the carrier, causing "flames". However, the surviving crew of ''Kaga'' reported no torpedo hits after the air attack. Of the four torpedoes launched, one failed to run, two ran erratically, and the fourth was a 'dud', impacting amidships and breaking in half.<ref>Lord, ''Incredible Victory'' p. 213; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 302<U+2013>303.</ref> History would show she had already made a more important contribution.

===Japanese counterattacks===
[[Image:USS Yorktown hit-740px.jpg|thumbnail|300px|left|USS ''Yorktown'' is hit by an aerial torpedo]]
''Hiry<U+016B>'', the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counterattacking. The first wave of Japanese dive-bombers badly damaged ''Yorktown'' with two bomb hits, yet her damage control teams patched her up so effectively (in about an hour) the second wave's torpedo bombers mistook her for an intact carrier. Despite Japanese hopes to even the battle by eliminating two carriers with two strikes, ''Yorktown'' absorbed both Japanese attacks, the second believing mistakenly ''Yorktown'' had already been sunk and they were attacking ''Enterprise.'' After two torpedo hits, ''Yorktown'' lost power and was now out of the battle, forcing Admiral Fletcher to move his flag to the heavy cruiser [[USS Astoria (CA-34)|''Astoria'']], but Task Force 16's two carriers had escaped undamaged as a result.

News of the two strikes, with the reports each had sunk an American carrier, greatly improved the morale of the crewmen of the ''Kido Butai''. Its surviving aircraft all recovered aboard ''Hiry<U+016B>'', where they were prepared for a strike against what was believed to be the only remaining American carrier. 

When American scout aircraft subsequently located ''Hiry<U+016B>'' late in the afternoon, ''Enterprise'' launched a final strike of dive bombers (including 10 bombers from ''Yorktown''), leaving ''Hiry<U+016B>'' ablaze, despite being defended by a strong defensive CAP of over a dozen Zero fighters. Rear Admiral Yamaguchi chose to go down with his ship, costing Japan perhaps her best carrier sailor. ''Hornet's'' strike, launching late because of a communications error, concentrated on the remaining surface ships but failed to score any hits.

As darkness fell, both sides took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged to abandon the derelict ''Yorktown'' and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance.  Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, but was still unsure of what Japanese forces remained at hand and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close Nagumo during the day, and persisted as night fell. 

For his part, Yamamoto initially decided to continue the effort and sent his remaining surface forces searching eastward for the American carriers. Simultaneously, a cruiser raiding force was detached to bombard the island. 

American search planes failed to detect the retiring Japanese task forces on June 5. An afternoon strike narrowly missed detecting Yamamoto's main body and failed to score hits on a straggling Japanese destroyer. The strike planes returned to the carriers after nightfall, prompting Spruance to order ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' to turn on searchlights in order to aid their landings. [[Marc Mitscher]], commanding ''Hornet'', would later issue the same order under similar circumstances during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].

At 02.15 on 5<U+2013>6 June, Commander John Murphy's [[USS Tambor (SS-198)|''Tambor'']], lying some 90mi (165km) west of Midway, made one of the Submarine Force's two major contributions to the battle's outcome, sighting several ships. He (along with his exec, Ray Spruance, Jr.) could not identify them (and feared they might be friendly, so he held fire), but reported their presence, omitting their course. This went to Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet (<small>COMSUBPAC</small>), and from him through Nimitz to the senior Spruance. Unaware of the exact location of Yamamoto's "Main Body" (a persistent problem since PBYs had first sighted the Japanese), Spruance presumed this was the invasion force. Thus, he moved to block it, taking station some 100mi (185km) northeast of Midway; this frustrated Yamamoto's efforts, and the night passed without any contact between the opposing forces. <ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' p. 320; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 345.</ref> 


In actuality, this was a group of four cruisers and two destroyers, Yamamoto's bombardment group, which at 02:55 were ordered to retire west with the rest of his force.<ref>Prange, ''Miracle at Midway,'' p.320; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', p. 345.</ref> Murphy was sighted around the same time; turning to avoid, [[Japanese cruiser Mogami (1934)|''Mogami'']] and [[Japanese cruiser Mikuma|''Mikuma'']] collided, inflicting serious damage to ''Mogami'''s bow, the most any of the eighteen<ref>Blair, chart p.240.</ref> submarines deployed for the battle achieved. Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was a hazard, and he dived to approach for an attack. This was unsuccessful, and at around 06.00, he finally reported two ''Mogami''-class cruisers, westbound, placing Spruance at least 100mi (185km) out of position.<ref>Blair, p.246<U+2013>7.</ref> It may have been fortunate Spruance did not pursue, for had he come in contact with Yamamoto's heavies, including ''Yamato'', in the dark, his cruisers would have been overwhelmed, his carriers helpless.<ref>Blair, p.246<U+2013>7; Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin''.</ref>

Over the following two days, first Midway and then Spruance's carriers launched several successive strikes against the stragglers. ''Mikuma'' was eventually sunk, while ''Mogami'' survived severe damage to return home for repairs. U.S. Marine Captain [[Richard E. Fleming]] was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his attack on ''Mikuma.''

''Yorktown'' was sunk during salvage efforts, by three torpedoes from Japanese submarine ''I-168'' on [[June 7]]. There were few casualties since most of the crew had already been evacuated. One torpedo from this salvo also sank the destroyer [[USS Hammann (DD-412)|USS ''Hammann'']], which had been providing auxiliary power to ''Yorktown'', splitting her in two with the loss of 80 lives.

==Aftermath==
After winning a clear victory, and as pursuit became too hazardous near Wake,<ref>Blair, p.247.</ref> American forces retired. Japan's loss of four out of their six fleet carriers, plus a large number of their highly trained aircrews, stopped the expansion of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific. Only [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh<U+014D>kaku|''Sh<U+014D>kaku'']] were left for offensive actions. Japan's other carriers, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>|''Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Junyo|''Junyo'']], and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiyo|''Hiyo'']], were light carriers with small airwings and comparatively poor effectiveness compared to fleet carriers. 

On 10 June, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] conveyed to the liaison conference an incomplete picture of the results of the battle, on the ground that the real extent of damage was a military secret not to be entrusted to all members. Only Emperor [[Hirohito]] was accurately informed of carriers and pilots losses, and he chose not to inform the Army immediately. Army planners then continued for a short time to believe that the fleet was healthy and secure.<ref>[[Herbert Bix]], ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2001, p. 449</ref>   

===Allegations of war crimes===
Three U.S. airmen, [[Ensign]] Wesley Osmus (pilot, ''Yorktown''), Ensign Frank O'Flaherty (pilot, ''Enterprise'') and [[Aviation Machinist's Mate]] B. F. (or B. P.) Gaido (radioman-gunner of O'Flaherty's SBD) were captured by the Japanese during the battle. Osmus was held on the destroyer ''Arashi'', with O'Flaherty and Gaido on the cruiser ''Nagara'' (or destroyer ''Makigumo'', sources vary), and it is alleged they were later killed.<ref>Robert E. Barde, "Midway: Tarnished Victory", ''Military Affairs'', v. 47, no. 4 (December 1983), pp. 188<U+2013>192.</ref> The report filed by Admiral Nagumo states of Ensign Osmus, "He died on 6 June and was buried [[Burial at sea|at sea]]". The report does not mention the death of O'Flaherty or Gaido.<ref name="nagumoreport">{{cite web | last =  | first = year = May 1947 | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJN/rep/Midway/Nagumo/index.html#III-3 | title = Japanese Story of the Battle of Midway | format = | work = ONI Review | publisher = ibiblio.org | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> The practice of burying the remains of the enemy at sea was common among all navies involved.

==Impact==
The battle has often been called "the turning point of the Pacific".<ref>Dull, p. 166; Prange, p. 395.</ref> The Japanese navy continued to fight ferociously, and it was many more months before the U.S. moved from a state of naval parity to one of increasingly clear supremacy.<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier and the Javelin,'' pp. 522<U+2013>523; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416<U+2013>430.</ref> Thus, Midway was not "decisive" in the same sense as [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] or [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. However, victory at Midway first gave the U.S. the strategic initiative, inflicted irreparable damage on the Japanese carrier force, and shortened the war in the Pacific.<ref>U.S. Naval War College Analysis, p. 1; Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416<U+2013>430.</ref>

Just two months later, the U.S. took the offensive and [[Guadalcanal campaign|attacked Guadalcanal]], catching the Japanese off-balance. Securing Allied supply lines to Australia and the Indian Ocean in this time frame, along with the heavy attrition inflicted on the Japanese during the Guadalcanal campaign, had far-reaching effects on the course of the war. Its effect on the length is debatable, given the Pacific Fleet's Submarine Force had essentially brought Japan's economy to a halt by January 1945.<ref>Blair, ''Silent Victory''.</ref>

Midway dealt Japanese naval aviation a heavy blow. The pre-war Japanese training program produced pilots of exceptional quality but at a slow rate.<ref>Peattie, ''Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909<U+2013>1941,'' pp. 181<U+2013>184, 191<U+2013>192.</ref> This small group of elite aviators were combat hardened veterans. At Midway, the Japanese lost as many of these pilots in a single day as their pre-war training program produced in a year.<ref>Peattie, ''Sunburst'', pp. 131<U+2013>134.</ref> Japanese planners failed to foresee a long continuous war, and consequently their production failed to replace the losses of ships, pilots, and sailors begun at Midway; by mid-1943, Japanese naval aviation was decimated.<ref>Peattie, ''Sunburst'', pp. 176<U+2013>186; Eric Bergerud, ''Fire in the Sky'', p. 668.</ref>

Even more important was the irredeemable loss of four of Japan's fleet carriers.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416<U+2013>421.</ref> These ships were not replaced, unit for unit, until early in 1945.<ref> ''Shinano'', commissioned on [[19 November]] [[1944]], was only the fourth fleet carrier commissioned by Japan during the war, after ''Taih<U+014D>'', ''Unry<U+016B>'', and ''Amagi''.</ref> In the same span of time, U.S. industrial capacity allowed the U.S. Navy to commission more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers, and numerous escort carriers.<ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/carriers/ listing of all American carriers commissioned during the war]. [http://www.combinedfleet.com/economic.htm [tabulation of aggregate carrier and carrier aircraft levels between the USN and IJN if the U.S. had lost at Midway].</ref> Thus, Midway permanently damaged the Japanese Navy's striking power and measurably shortened the period during which the Japanese carrier force could fight on advantageous terms. The loss of operational capability during this critical phase of the campaign ultimately proved disastrous; Imperial Japan could have executed much grander, and perhaps more successful, operations against the U.S. counter-offensive being marshaled. Whether this would have happened is debatable, however, as the Japanese awaited "decisive battle", and as American submarines increasingly hampered the flow of oil essential for fleet operations.

==Discovery==
===U.S. vessels===
Because of the extreme depth of the ocean in the area of the battle (more than 17,000 feet/5200 m), researching the battlefield has presented extraordinary difficulties. However, on [[May 19]], [[1998]], [[Robert Ballard]] and a team of scientists and Midway veterans (including Japanese participants) located and photographed ''Yorktown''. The ship was remarkably intact for a vessel that sank in 1942; much of the original equipment and even the original paint scheme were still visible.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9806/04/yorktown.found/index.html|title=Titanic explorer finds Yorktown|date=[[1998-06-04]]|accessdate=2007-07-01|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

===Japanese vessels===
Ballard's subsequent search for the Japanese carriers was ultimately unsuccessful. In September 1999, a joint expedition between Nauticos Corp. and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office searched for the Japanese aircraft carriers.  Using advanced renavigation techniques in conjunction with the ship's log of the submarine USS ''Nautilus'', the expedition located a large piece of wreckage, which was subsequently identified as having come from the upper hangar deck of carrier ''Kaga''.<ref>Parshall & Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 491<U+2013>493.</ref> The main wreck, however, has yet to be located.

==In Film==
[[Image:USS Hammann sinking 1942-06-06 seen from USS Yorktown.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|During an attempt to salvage [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']] both it and [[USS Hammann (DD-412)|the destroyer ''Hammann'']] were struck by torpedoes from [[Japanese submarine I-168|''I-168'']].]]
The Battle of Midway has been featured in several [[motion picture]]s. The first film about the battle was a documentary directed by [[John Ford]], a Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve at the time, and on temporary duty at Midway Island during the battle as a photographic and intelligence officer. While shooting 16mm color motion picture footage from atop the island's power plant, Ford was exposed to enemy fire by attacking aircraft and wounded in the arm by shrapnel. He received a Purple Heart and later, the Legion of Merit for his actions. The film Ford shot during the actual battle is included in his 1942 [[Academy Award]] winning documentary, ''[[The Battle of Midway]]''. 

Subsequently, the dramatic film ''[[Midway (film)|Midway]]'', directed by [[Jack Smight]], and starring [[Charlton Heston]], was [[1976 in film|released in 1976]]. It strongly fictionalized events and relied heavily on [[stock footage]] from various World War II battles, as well as some previously filmed for [[Tora! Tora! Tora!]], for which it was criticized.
==Other Remembrances==
The [[Chicago Midway International Airport]] or simply Midway Airport, historically important to the war efforts in World War II, was renamed in 1949 in honor of the Battle of Midway. Previously, it was named the Chicago Municipal Airport.
