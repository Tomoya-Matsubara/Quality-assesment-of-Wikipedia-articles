'''London''' ({{Audio|En-uk-London.ogg|pronunciation}}; [[Help:Pronunciation|IPA]] {{IPA|/<U+02C8>l<U+028C>nd<U+0259>n/}}) is the [[capital]] and largest urban area of [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. At its core, the ancient [[City of London]], to which the name historically belongs, still retains its limited medieval boundaries; but since at least the 19th century the name "London" has also referred to the whole metropolis which has developed around it.<ref name=mills>Mills, A., ''Dictionary of London Place Names'', (2001)</ref> Today the bulk of this conurbation forms the London [[Regions of England|region of England]]<ref name=region>Government Offices for the English Regions - [http://www.gos.gov.uk/gol/factgol/London/?a=42496 Fact Files: London]</ref> and the [[Greater London]] administrative area,<ref name=elcock>Elcock, H., ''Local Government'', (1994)</ref> with its own elected mayor and assembly.<ref name=politics_uk>Jones, B., Kavanagh, D., Norton, P. & Moran, M., ''Politics UK'', (2004)</ref>

An important settlement for [[History of London|two millennia]], London's history goes back to its founding by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Since its settlement, London has been the centre of many important movements and phenomena throughout history such as the [[English Renaissance]], the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]].

{{main|Geography of London}}
===Scope===
[[Image:Mill.bridge.from.tate.modern.arp.jpg|thumb|The [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]], infamously known as the ''Wobbly Bridge''.]]
London can be defined in a number of different ways. At London's core is the small, ancient [[City of London]] which is commonly known as 'the City' or 'Square Mile'. London's metropolitan area grew considerably during the [[Victorian era]] and again during the [[Interwar period]], but expansion halted in the 1940s because of [[World War II]] and [[Green Belt (UK)|Green Belt]] legislation, and the area has been largely static since.<ref>Hill, D., ''Urban Policy and Politics in Britain'', (2000)</ref> The London [[regions of England|region of England]], also commonly known as [[Greater London]], is the area administered by the [[Greater London Authority]].<ref name=region/> The urban sprawl of the conurbation<U+2014>or [[Greater London Urban Area]]<U+2014>covers a roughly similar area, with a slightly larger population.

Forty percent of Greater London is covered by the [[London postal district]], within which 'LONDON' forms part of the postal address.<ref>HMSO, ''The Inner London Letter Post'', (1980)</ref> The [[020|London telephone area code]] covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are omitted and some places just outside are included.

Informally, the city is split into [[North London|North]], [[South London|South]], [[East London, England|East]], [[West London|West]] and often also [[Central London]].

The [[Metropolitan Police District]], [[History of local government in London|city-wide local government area]] and [[History of transport in London (1933-2003)|London transport area]] have varied over time, but currently broadly coincide with the Greater London boundary.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1999/19990029.htm OPSI] - Greater London Authority Act 1999 Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] may have marked the centre of ''[[Londinium]]'' with the [[London Stone]], still visible on [[Cannon Street]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Trafalgar Square History | url = http://www.london.gov.uk/trafalgarsquare/history/index.jsp | accessdate = 2006-12-02}}</ref> The coordinates of the nominal centre of London (traditionally considered to be the original [[Eleanor Cross]] at [[Charing Cross]], near the junction of [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Whitehall]]) are approximately {{coor dms|51|30|29|N|00|07|29|W|type:city(7,000,000)_region:GB}}.

===Topography===

Greater London covers an area of 609 square miles (1,579 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]), making it the 37th largest [[List of cities by population|urban area in the world]].<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-area-125.html World's Largest Urban Areas]. Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> Its primary geographical feature is the [[River Thames|Thames]], a [[navigable river]] which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills such as [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. These hills presented no significant obstacle to the growth of London from its origins as a port on the north side of the river, and therefore London is roughly circular.

The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marshland]]s; at high tide, its shores reached five times their current width.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=thames+%22iron+age%22+london+wide+geography+shallow+marsh&ots=wVDtRsVF-V&sig=GFqR9QKs45u-ggfYI0dcCA3GUzc#PPA10,M1 ''London: A History, by Francis Sheppard page 10.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> Since the [[Victorian era]] It has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[tributary|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]]. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.<ref>[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&lang=_e "Flooding"] - UK [[Environment Agency]]. Retrieved on [[2006-06-19]].</ref> The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in [[Tide|high water]] level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-[[glacier|glacial]] [[isostatic rebound|rebound]].<ref>[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&lang=_e "Sea Levels" - UK Environment Agency] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] across the Thames at [[Woolwich]] to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2030, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5092218.stm BBC News: On the rise: The Thames in 2100] Retrieved on [[2007-04-19]].</ref>

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names (e.g. [[Bloomsbury, London|Bloomsbury]], [[Knightsbridge]], [[Mayfair]], [[Whitechapel]], [[Fitzrovia]]). These are either informal designations, or reflect the names of superseded parishes and city wards. Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a neighbourhood with its own distinctive character, but often with no modern official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 [[London borough]]s in addition to the ancient City of London.

London is one of the world's three largest financial centres (alongside [[New York City|New York]] and [[Tokyo]]) with a dominant role in several international financial markets, including cross-border bank lending, international bond issuance and trading, foreign-exchange trading, over-the-counter derivatives, fund management and foreign equities trading.<ref name="London Financial District">[http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/cm/business/cases/london.htm London: Centre of International Finance.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> It also has the world's largest insurance market, the leading exchange for dealing in non-precious metals, the largest spot gold and gold lending markets, the largest ship broking market, and more foreign banks and investment houses than any other centre.<ref name="London Financial District">[http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/cm/business/cases/london.htm London: Center of International Finance.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> The City has its own governance and boundaries, giving it a status as the only completely autonomous local authority in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/about_us/_whatis.htm |title=What is the City of London? |work=City of London Corporation |accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref> London's new financial and commercial hub is the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area to the east of the City, dominated by the [[Canary Wharf]] complex.

[[Image:London Eye Twilight April 2006.jpg|The London Eye at twilight|thumb|right|[[London Eye]] at night ]]

London is too large to be overwhelmingly characterised by any particular [[architectural]] style, having accumulated its buildings over a long period of time and drawn on an inexhaustible range of influences. It is, however, mainly [[brick]] built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]].<ref name="London Architecture">[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/London:+architecture London: architecture.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> Many grand houses and public buildings (such as the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]]) are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, except for a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the City. A majority of buildings in London date from the [[Edwardian]] or [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] periods.<ref name="London Architecture">[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/London:+architecture London: architecture.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> The disused (but soon to be rejuvenated) 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]] (at least internally).<ref>[http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html Paddington Station.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref>

The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]], high residential densities in [[inner London]] and lower densities in the [[Outer London|suburbs]]. In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium-rise and [[high-rise]] buildings. London's skyscrapers such as the famous [[30 St Mary Axe|"Gherkin"]], [[Tower 42]] and [[One Canada Square]] are usually found in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape, the [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]], and the Great Court of the [[British Museum]]. What was formerly the [[Millennium Dome]], located by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now used as an entertainment venue known as The O<sub>2</sub> Arena.

In recent years, the development of [[Tall buildings in London|tall buildings]] has been encouraged in the [[London Plan]], which will lead to the erection of new skyscrapers over the next few years as London goes through a high-rise boom, particularly in the City of London and Canary Wharf.<ref>{{cite web| title = London - Full Summary of Projects| publisher= Will Fox, SkyscraperCity.com| url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=46| accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref> The 72-storey, 1017-foot (310 m) "[[Shard London Bridge]]" by [[London Bridge station]], the 945-foot (288 m) [[Bishopsgate Tower]] and around 30 other skyscrapers over 500 feet (150 m) are either proposed or approved and could transform the city's skyline.

A great many monuments pay homage to people and events in the city. [[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally-recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of the centre.

===Environment===
{{main|Parks and open spaces in London|Royal Parks of London}}

Often called "The Green City," London has a number of open spaces.<ref>[http://www.londonlogue.com/travel-tips/green-city-walks-in-london.html] Green City Walks in London. Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> The largest of these in the central area are the [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Parks]] of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and its neighbour [[Kensington Gardens]] at the western edge of [[central London]] and [[Regent's Park]] on the northern edge. This park is located near the tourist attractions of Baker Street, where the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] lived, and [[Madame Tussauds]] Wax Museum. Closer to central London are the smaller Royal Parks of [[Green Park]] and [[St. James's Park]]. Hyde Park in particular is popular for [[London#Sports|sports]] and sometimes hosts open-air concerts.

A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including the remaining Royal Parks of [[Greenwich Park]] to the south-east, [[Bushy Park]] and [[Richmond Park]] to the south-west and [[Victoria Park, East London]] to the east. [[Primrose Hill]] to the north of Regent's Park is a popular spot to view the city skyline. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the {{convert|791|acre|sqkm|1|sing=on}} [[Hampstead Heath]] of [[North London]]. This incorporates [[Kenwood House]], the former [[stately home]] and a popular location in the summer months where classical music concerts are held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.  In the extreme South East of Greater London, the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]] and [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]] are noted for their open spaces and extensive wooded areas.

==History==
{{main|History of London}}

===Etymology===
{{dablink|See also: [[History of London#etymology]]}}

The etymology of London remains unclear. The earliest mention of the city's toponym can be attributed to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. The name is described as originating from [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]] in which he had allegedly taken over the city and named it after himself to ''Kaerlud''. This was then eventually slurred into ''Kaerludein'' and finally ''London''. Although some sources support this theory<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=EawMAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60&dq=%22etymology+of+London%22]</ref>, Geoffrey's work is largely based on Celtic folklore and it is believed that he was trying to balance historical writings in order to give pre-eminence to Roman, Saxon, and Norman versions of history.<ref>[http://chr.org.uk/legends.htm]</ref>

Several other explanations have been proposed by linguists throughout history. Many propose that the name comes from [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] meaning "city on the lake" or "fortress on the lake".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=xj8lAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA453&lpg=PA453&dq=%22etymology+of+london%22&source=web&ots=rEY1nX7M1L&sig=c3WKSFbNa-FCpA3w1YMQ7XH8lzo#PPA453,M1]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=zcYgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA29-IA1&dq=%22etymology+of+London%22#PPA29-IA1,M1]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=2OcGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA474&dq=%22etymology+of+London%22&lr=#PPA474,M1]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=MBkAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA379&dq=%22name+of+London%22]</ref> Other theories propose the name to mean "precinct of the fortress",<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DuX6reRuEaMC&pg=PA505&lpg=PA505&dq=%22etymology+of+london%22&source=web&ots=oKVPnMnRIj&sig=QUjU7QdP0sn6-xfz-24Vk021PwI]</ref> "city on the hill",<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DuX6reRuEaMC&pg=PA505&dq=%22name+of+London%22]</ref> "city of the Moon",<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=tnEEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA42&dq=%22etymology+of+London%22&lr=#PPA42,M1]</ref>, or "city on the grove"<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=lqkHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA4&dq=%22etymology+of+London%22&lr=]</ref> Another possible explanation is that the area of London was previously settled by [[Belgium|Belgians]] who named their outposts after townships in Belgium. Some of these Belgian toponyms have been attributed to the namesake of London including ''Lime'', ''Douvrend'', and ''Londini<U+00E8>res''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rDAMAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA299&dq=%22etymology+of+London%22&lr=]</ref> Another theory suggests that the Anglo-Saxons were descendants of the [[Tribe of Dan]]. When inhabiting in the area, it is possible that they would have named their settlement ''lan-dan'', meaning "place of Dan" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1283%28197921%2954%3A1%3C61%3AEWOSHO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage]</ref>

[[Richard Coates]], a [[linguistics]] professor at the [[University of Sussex]] surmised that the name derives from the pre-Celtic ''Plowonida'', which roughly means "a river too wide to ford". He suggested that when a settlement was founded, the inhabitants added the suffix ''-on'' or ''-onjon'' to toponyms. Supposedly, the Celts didn't pronounce the "P" and through linguistic change, the name developed from ''Plowonidonjon'' to ''Lundonjon'', then contracted to ''Lundein'' or ''Lundyn'', and finally latinised to ''Londinium'' via the Romans.<ref>[http://chr.org.uk/legends.htm]</ref>

===Early London===
{{imagestack|
[[Image:Westminster Abbey - West Door.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Westminster Abbey]] is one of London's oldest and most important buildings]]
|right}}
Although there is some evidence of scattered [[Brython]] settlement in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in AD 43 as ''[[Roman London|Londinium]]'', following the [[Roman conquest of Britain]]. The first London lasted for just seventeen years. Around AD 61, the [[Iceni]] tribe of [[Celt]]s led by Queen [[Boudica]] stormed London, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily-planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded [[Colchester]] as the capital of the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] in AD 100. At its height in the 2nd century AD, Roman London had a population of around 60,000. However, by the 3rd century AD, the city started a slow decline due to trouble in the [[Roman Empire]], and by the 5th century AD, it was largely abandoned.<ref name = "London Population">[http://www.londononline.co.uk/factfile/historical/ Historical Overview of London Population.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref>

By 600 AD, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had created a new settlement called ''[[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]]'' about 1 km upstream from the old Roman city, around what is now [[Covent Garden]].<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> There was probably a harbour at the mouth of the [[River Fleet]] for fishing and trading, and this trading grew until disaster struck in 851 AD, when the city's defences were overcome by a massive [[Viking]] raid and it was razed to the ground.<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> A Viking occupation twenty years later was short-lived, and [[Alfred the Great]], the new King of England, established peace and moved the settlement within the [[defensive wall]]s of the old Roman city (then called ''[[Lundenburgh]]''). The original city became ''Ealdwic'' ("old city"), a name surviving to the present day as [[Aldwych]].

Subsequently, under the control of various English kings, London once again prospered as an international trading centre and political arena. However, Viking raids began again in the late 10th century, and reached a head in 1013 when they besieged the city under Danish King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and forced English King [[Ethelred the Unready]] to flee.<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> In a retaliatory attack, Ethelred's army achieved victory by pulling down [[London Bridge]] with the Danish garrison on top, and English control was re-established.

Canute took control of the English throne in 1017, controlling the city and country until 1042, when his death resulted in a reversion to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] control under his pious step-son [[Edward the Confessor]], who re-founded [[Westminster Abbey]] and the adjacent [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> By this time, London had become the largest and most prosperous city in England, although the official [[seat of government]] was still at [[Winchester]].<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref>

===Norman and medieval London===
{{see also|Fortifications of London}}
[[Image:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed many parts of the city in 1666]]
Following a victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]], the then [[Duke of Normandy]], was crowned King of England in the newly-finished [[Westminster Abbey]] on [[Christmas Day]] 1066. William granted the citizens of London special privileges, while building a castle in the south-east corner of the city to keep them under control. This castle was expanded by later kings and is now known as the [[Tower of London]], serving first as a [[Palace|royal residence]] and later as a [[prison]].

In 1097, [[William II of England|William II]] began the building of [[Westminster Hall]], close by the abbey of the same name. The hall proved the basis of a new [[Palace of Westminster]], the prime royal residence throughout [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]]. Westminster became the seat of the royal court and government (persisting until the present day), while its distinct neighbour, the City of London, was a centre of trade and commerce and flourished under its own unique administration, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]. Eventually, the adjacent cities grew together and formed the basis of modern [[central London]], superseding [[Winchester]] as capital of England in the 12th century.

London grew in wealth and population during the Middle Ages. In 1100 its population was around 18,000, by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.<ref name = "London Population">[http://www.londononline.co.uk/factfile/historical/ Historical Overview of London Population.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> However disaster struck during the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.<ref name = "London Population">[http://www.londononline.co.uk/factfile/historical/ Historical Overview of London Population.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> Apart from the invasion of London during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, London remained relatively untouched by the various civil wars during the Middle Ages, such as the [[First Barons' War|first]] and [[Second Barons' War|second]] Barons' Wars and the [[Wars of the Roses]].

After the successful defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, political stability in England allowed London to grow further. In 1603, [[James VI of Scotland]] came to the throne of England, essentially uniting the two countries. His enactment of harsh [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] laws made him unpopular, and an [[Assassination|assassination attempt]] was made on [[5 November]] [[1605]]<U+2014>the famous [[Gunpowder Plot]].<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref>

[[Black Death|Plague]] caused extensive problems for London in the early 17th century, culminating in the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] in 1665<U+2013>1666. This was the last major outbreak in Europe, possibly thanks to the disastrous fire of 1666. The [[Great Fire of London]] broke out in the original City and quickly swept through London's wooden buildings, destroying large swathes of the city. Rebuilding took over ten years.<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref>

===Rise of modern London===
[[Image:LondonBombedWWII.png|thumb|left|A London street hit during [[the Blitz]] of [[World War II]]]]
Following London's growth in the 18th century, it became the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.<ref>[http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm Largest Cities Through History] Retrieved on [[2007-08-16]].</ref> This growth was aided from 1836 by London's first [[railway]]s, which put countryside towns within easy reach of the city. The rail network expanded very rapidly, and caused these places to grow while London itself expanded into surrounding fields, merging with neighbouring settlements such as [[Kensington]]. Rising [[traffic congestion]] on city centre roads led to the creation of the world's first [[metro]] system<U+2014>the [[London Underground]]<U+2014>in 1863, driving further expansion and urbanisation.<ref name="Metro">{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/1604.aspx |title=London Underground: History|author=Transport for London |accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref> Because of this rapid growth, London became one of the first cities in human history to reach a population of one million, and was the first ever to surpass five million.

London's [[local government]] system struggled to cope with the rapid growth, especially in providing the city with adequate [[Infrastructure in London|infrastructure]]. Between 1855 and 1889, the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] oversaw infrastructure expansion. It was then replaced by the [[County of London]], overseen by the [[London County Council]], London's first elected city-wide administration.

[[The Blitz]] and other bombing by the [[Germany|German]] ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during [[World War II]] killed over 30,000 Londoners<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/homefront/arp/arp4.html |title=Air Raid Precautions |work="Home Front" Website |accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref> and flattened large tracts of housing and other buildings across London. The rebuilding during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was characterised by a wide range of [[architectural style]]s and has resulted in a lack of architectural unity that has become part of London's character. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area outside the County of London's borders. The expanded area was called [[Greater London]] and was administered by the [[Greater London Council]].

In the decades following World War II, large-scale immigration from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and beyond transformed London into one of the most racially and culturally diverse cities in Europe. Integration of the new immigrants was not always smooth, with major [[race riot]]s in [[Notting Hill]] and [[Brixton]], but was certainly smoother than in other English regions and largely lacking in widespread support for far right organisations, unlike its European or American contemporaries.

An economic revival from the 1980s onwards re-established London's position as a pre-eminent international centre. However, as the seat of government and the most important city in the UK, it has been subjected to bouts of [[terrorism]]. [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] bombers sought to pressure the [[British government|government]] into negotiations over [[Northern Ireland]], frequently disrupting city activities with [[bomb threat]]s<U+2014>some of which were carried out<U+2014>until their 1997 cease-fire. More recently, a [[7 July 2005 London bombings|series of coordinated bomb attacks]] were carried out by Islamic extremist [[suicide bombers]] on the public transport network on [[7 July]] [[2005]]<U+2014>just 24 hours after London was [[2012 Summer Olympics bids|awarded]] the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

===Local government===
{{main|Local government in London|History of local government in London}}

The administration of London takes place in two tiers<U+2014>a city-wide, strategic tier and a local tier. City-wide administration is coordinated by the [[Greater London Authority]] (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> The GLA consists of two elected parts; the [[Mayor of London]], who has executive powers, and the [[London Assembly]], who scrutinize the Mayor's decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year. The GLA is a recent organisation, having been set up in 2000 to replace the similar [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) which had been abolished in 1986.<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> The headquarters of the GLA and the Mayor of London is at [[City Hall London|City Hall]]. The Mayor of London is [[Ken Livingstone]]. The 33 local authorities are the councils of the 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London Corporation]].<ref name = "Local Government">[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> They are responsible for local services not overseen by the GLA, such as local planning, schools, [[Social work|social services]], local roads and refuse collection.

===National government===
[[Image:Palace of Westminster, London - Feb 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] at dusk]]
London is the home of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] which is located around the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in [[Westminster]]. Many government departments are located close to Parliament, particularly along [[Whitehall]], including the Prime Minister's residence at [[10 Downing Street]].

The British Parliament is often referred to as the "Mother of Parliaments" (although this ''[[sobriquet]]'' was first applied to England itself by [[John Bright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/96021.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=2007-08-09 |date=1998-06-03 |title=UK Politics: Talking Politics &mdash; The 'Mother of Parliaments'}}</ref>) because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments. Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British "three-tier" model. Most countries in Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial head of state who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house and a smaller, upper house.

London is represented in the national [[British House of Commons|Parliament]] by 74 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) who correspond to local parliamentary [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]].<ref>[http://www.gatewaysmoving.com/about_moving_to_london_england_uk.htm History and general information .] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref> For a list of London constituencies, see [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Greater London]]. Of these 74 MPs, 44 are from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], 21 are [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 8 are [[Liberal Democrats]] and one is from the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|RESPECT]] party.

With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was the most populated city in the world until overtaken by [[New York City|New York]] in 1925. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939. There were an estimated 7,512,400 official residents in [[Greater London]] as of mid-2006.<ref name=Greater_London_population /> However, London's continuous [[urban area]] extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 8,278,251 people in 2001,<ref name=urban_area_pop /> while its wider [[metropolitan area]] has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition of that area.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.demographia.com/dm-lonarea.htm |title=South-east England Population by Area from 1891 |work=demographia.com |accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref> According to [[Eurostat]], London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union,<ref>[[Largest cities and metropolitan areas in the European Union (Eurostat)]]</ref> and the second [[Largest European cities and metropolitan areas|most populous]] in [[Europe]].

London has been a focus for immigration for centuries, whether as a place of safety or for economic reasons. [[Huguenot]]s, eastern European [[Jew]]s and Cypriots are examples of the former; Irish, [[Bangla Desh]]is and West Indians came for new lives. The [[East End]] district around [[Spitalfields]] has been first home for several ethnic groups, which have subsequently moved elsewhere in London as they gained prosperity.

The [[Docklands Light Railway]] is a second metro system using smaller and lighter trains, which opened in 1987, serving [[East London]] and Greenwich on both sides of the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Commuter and intercity railways generally do not cross the city, instead running into [[London railway station|fourteen terminal stations]] scattered around its historic centre; the exception is the [[Thameslink]] route operated by [[First Capital Connect]], with terminus stations at [[Bedford]] [[Brighton]] and [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]]. Since the early 1990s, increasing pressures on the commuter rail and Underground networks have led to increasing demands &mdash; particularly from businesses and the [[City of London Corporation]] &mdash; for [[Crossrail]]: a <U+00A3>10 billion east-west heavy rail connection under central London, which was given the green light in early October 2007.<ref name="Olympic Infrastructure">[http://www.alarm-uk.org/pdf/Janet%20Goodland.pdf London 2012 Olympic Transport Infrastructure.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-17]].</ref>

High-speed [[Eurostar]] trains link [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]] with [[Lille]] and [[Paris]] in [[France]], and [[Brussels]] in [[Belgium]]. Journey times to Paris and Brussels of 2h 15 and 1h 51 respectively make London closer to continental Europe than the rest of Britain by virtue of the newly-completed [[High Speed 1]] rail link to the [[Channel Tunnel]]. From 2009 this line will also allow for high speed domestic travel from Kent into London. The redevelopment of St. Pancras was key to London's Olympic bid, as the station also serves two international airports through Thameslink, and will also provide direct rail links to the Olympic site at [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] using British Rail Class 395 trains, based on Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high-speed trains.
