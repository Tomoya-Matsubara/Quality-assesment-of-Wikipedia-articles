'''Washington's 6th congressional district''' encompasses the [[Olympic Peninsula]], most of the [[Kitsap Peninsula]], and most of the city of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. Since [[United States House election, 1976|1977]], the 6th District has been represented in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] by [[Norm Dicks]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] from [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]].

Established after the [[United States Census, 1930|1930 U.S. Census]], the 6th District is a [[working class]] district, with many of its jobs provided by [[tourism]] and a declining [[timber industry]] on the Pacific and [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|Juan de Fuca]] coasts, and by the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in Bremerton. Dicks, who has served in the U.S. Congress for more than a decade longer than any other member of the Washington delegation, is known as a so-called "defense Democrat" who is hawkish on national defense and takes moderate positions on many issues.

Presidentially, the 6th leans Democratic.  [[Al Gore]] and [[John Kerry]] carried the district in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] with 52% and 53% of the vote, respectively. [[Barack Obama]] swept the district in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] with 57% of the vote.
