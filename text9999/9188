'''Boosey & Hawkes''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Sheet music|music publisher]] that claims to be the largest specialist [[classical music]] publisher in the world. Until 2003, it was also a major manufacturer of [[brass instrument|brass]], [[string instrument|string]] and [[wind instrument|wind]] [[musical instrument]]s.

Formed in 1930 through the merger of two well-established British music businesses, the company owns the [[copyright]]s or agencies to much major 20th century music, including works by [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k|Bart<U+00F3>k]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], [[Zolt<U+00E1>n Kod<U+00E1>ly|Kod<U+00E1>ly]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers.

With subsidiaries in Germany, the UK and the US, the company also sells [[sheet music]]; provides ready-made [[production music]] for television, radio and audio-visual use; commissions and produces music for radio, television and advertising [[jingle]]s; and administers [[copyright]]s owned by media companies.

==History==
===Before the merger of the Boosey and Hawkes companies===
Boosey & Hawkes was founded in 1930 through the merger of two respected music companies, Boosey & Company and Hawkes & Son.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Historical Note|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/corporate/overview/historicalnote.asp|publisher=Boosey & Hawkes|accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>

Boosey.

Thomas Boosey's son, also named Thomas (1794/1795<U+2013>1871), set up a separate musical branch of the company known as T. Boosey & Co. and, in the latter part of the 19th century, Boosey & Company. This branch initially imported foreign music but soon began publishing in England the works of composers such as [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Saverio Mercadante]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]], and subsequently important [[opera]]s by [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]. [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] were among its later signings.<ref name="Times: Instrumental Role">{{cite news|last=Jagger|first=Suzy|title=Instrumental Role in Music-Making|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1098289.ece|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[2003-03-20]]}}</ref> The company also produced books: among its first publications was an English translation of [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]]'s book ''Life of J.S. Bach'' (1820).<ref>{{cite book|last=Forkel|first=Johann Nicolaus|authorlink=Johann Nikolaus Forkel|coauthors=Banker Stephenson (transl.)|title=Life of J.S. Bach; with a Critical View of His Compositions... Translated from the German. [by Stephenson.]|location=London|publisher=T.

Jeffreys'' (1854) which deprived English publishers of many of their foreign copyrights.<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/>

Boosey & Company diversified into manufacturing [[wind instrument]]s in 1851, collaborating in 1856 with [[flautist]] R.S. Pratten (1846<U+2013>1936) to develop new designs for [[flute]]s. The firm bought over the business of [[Distin|Henry Distin]] in 1868, allowing it to begin making [[brass instrument]]s. Among its achievements was the widely-acclaimed design for [[Brass instrument#Compensation system|compensating valves]] developed by David James Blaikley in 1874.<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/> The company also commenced production of [[string instrument]]s.<ref name="Times: Instrumental Role"/>

The company capitalized on the increasing popularity of the [[Ballad (music)|ballad]] by focusing its publishing activities on them. To promote sales, John Boosey (''c.''1832<U+2013>1893), son of Thomas jr., established the [[London Ballad Concerts]] in 1867 at [[St. James's Hall]]  and later at [[Queen's Hall]] when it opened in 1893. [[Clara Butt]] and [[John Sims Reeves]] performed at these concerts, and its successes included [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s "[[The Lost Chord]]" (1877) and [[Stephen Adams (composer)|Stephen Adams]]' "The Holy City". The company began emphasizing [[educational music]] from about the end of the 19th century.<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/>

In 1874 Boosey & Company moved into offices at 295 [[Regent Street]],<ref name="Boosey: Locations"/> where the business was to stay for the next 131 years. In 1892, Boosey & Company opened an office in [[New York]] which still exists today.<ref name="Times: Instrumental Role"/> The business eventually owned half of Regent Street, and at the time of the merger was managed by Leslie Boosey (1887<U+2013>1979).<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes">{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Helen|title=Musical Marriage that Soared <U+2013> and Soured|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/26/bmbnh126.xml|publisher=[[The Telegraph]] (Review)|date=[[2007-04-26]]}}</ref>

Hawkes & Son (later Rivi<U+00E8>re & Hawkes),<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/> a rival to Boosey & Company, was founded in 1865 by William Henry Hawkes selling orchestral [[sheet music]]. The company also made musical instruments and spare parts such as [[clarinet]] [[Reed (instrument)|reeds]], and by 1925 Hawkes had set up an instrument factory in [[Edgware]], [[North London]].<ref name="Times: Instrumental Role"/> The business, which was particularly known for [[Brass band|brass]] and [[military band]] music,<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/> was eventually inherited by Ralph Hawkes (1898<U+2013>1950).

===After the merger===
Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes met in the 1920s when they were on the Board of the [[Performing Right Society]], and saw an opportunity to go into business together. They formed Boosey & Hawkes in 1930 through a merger of their respective businesses.<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes"/> Hawkes & Son moved from its office in Denman Street to join the Boosey staff at 295 Regent Street.<ref name="Boosey: Locations"/>

The 1938 [[Anschluss]] <U+2013> the [[annexation]] of [[Austria]] into [[Gro<U+00DF>deutschland|Greater Germany]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] <U+2013> led to the Nazification of [[Vienna|Viennese]] publishing house [[Universal Edition]]. Boosey & Hawkes seized the opportunity to sign up [[composer]]s [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k]] and [[Zolt<U+00E1>n Kod<U+00E1>ly]], and also rescued Universal's [[Jew]]ish staff, who later played an important role in developing the company. One such employee in particular, [[:de:Ernst Roth (Musikverleger)|Ernst Roth]] (1896<U+2013>1971), facilitated the signing of [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], and was instrumental in the production of Strauss's ''Vier letzte Lieder'' (''[[Four Last Songs]]'') (1948; premi<U+00E8>red 1950) and Stravinsky's ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (premi<U+00E8>red 1951).<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes"/> Another significant figure from Vienna who occupied an editorial role was composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s pupil [[Erwin Stein]], and after the war the composer [[Leopold Spinner]], a pupil of [[Anton Webern]], was also on the editorial staff. Stein was instrumental in founding the modern-music journal ''[[Tempo (journal)|Tempo]]'' in 1939,<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/> which began as Boosey & Hawkes' own newsletter but later became a more independent publication.

By the time [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, Boosey & Hawkes had also signed [[Aaron Copland]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. It was Ralph Hawkes who championed Britten when he was still relatively unknown, often against the rest of the board of directors, until the premi<U+00E8>re on [[7 June]] [[1945]] of ''[[Peter Grimes]]'', which was a critical and popular success. [[Sheet music]] sales soared during the War, enabling Boosey & Hawkes to buy [[Editions Russes]] which held the rights to the most valuable works of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] and Stravinsky. The company also purchased the lease of the [[Royal Opera House]] in London in 1944,<ref>{{cite book|last=Haltrecht|first=Montague|title=The Quiet Showman : Sir David Webster and the Royal Opera House|location=London|publisher=Collins|year=1975|isbn=0-00-211163-2|pages=51}}</ref> rescuing it from becoming a permanent dance hall and providing a venue for world-class [[ballet]] and [[opera]] in the capital.<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes"/>

[[Image:Covent Garden Theatre 1827-28.jpg|thumb|280px|left|An illustration of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, by [[Thomas H. Shepherd]], published in 1827<U+2013>1828. It became known as the [[Royal Opera House]] in 1892.]]

By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was a leading international music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in [[Bonn]], [[Johannesburg]], New York, [[Paris]], [[Toronto]] and [[Sydney]]. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun to appear in the relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of <U+00A3>100,000 during the War without the permission of the exchange control authorities, and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from [[New York]], leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly in 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of [[Harmonica|mouth organs]] and ovens which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, to the point that the company was forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency. Fortunately for the company, Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961.<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes"/>

[[Image:Boosey-Shostakovich-ViolinConcertoNo1-cover.jpg|thumb|The iconic brown cover of Boosey & Hawkes' pocket edition of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s ''[[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Violin Concerto No. 1]]'' (Op. 77; sometimes numbered Op. 99).]]

During these difficult years, Boosey was supported by his trusted managing director, Ernst Roth. However, Roth later regarded the Boosey family as ineffectual and parochial. In the early 1960s, Roth forced Boosey's sons Anthony and Simon out of the company, and prevented his youngest son, Nigel, from even joining, allegedly at the behest of Benjamin Britten. Roth and Boosey also had differences over Britten's influence over the company. Roth regarded Britten as a gifted local musician, rather than a true genius like Roth's friends Strauss and Stravinsky. Boosey realized how valuable Britten was to the company, and agreed to Britten's request to divide the company into instruments and publishing. However, Britten humiliated Boosey by preventing him from chairing the music publishing board Boosey had established at Britten's request. In 1963, Britten also managed to get Boosey & Hawkes to employ [[Donald Mitchell (writer on music)|Donald Mitchell]] to find new, young composers for the company. Angered by the sway Britten had over Boosey, Roth fired Mitchell within a year. Mitchell later set up [[Faber Music]] for book publisher [[Faber and Faber]] with the assistance of Britten and the blessing of [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes"/>

Boosey retired from the company in 1964, and died without an obituary in 1979. Although he had been awarded with the ''[[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]'' by France, his achievements were mostly unrecognized in the UK. However, a large number of composers and their estates continue to benefit from his pioneering work in rights and royalty collection.<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes"/> In addition, every two years the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] and the [[Performing Right Society]] honour individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the furtherance of contemporary music in Britain with the Leslie Boosey Award. The award is given to those who work "backstage", such as administrators, broadcasters, educationalists, programmers, publishers and representatives from the recording industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leslie Boosey Award|url=http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/?page=awards/boosey/|publisher=[[Royal Philharmonic Society]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>

Boosey & Hawkes' musical instruments division was gradually scaled down from the mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By the time of the closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], and the instruments rebranded [[Besson (company)|Besson]].<ref name="Guardian: Test Your Strength">{{cite news|last=Wyse|first=Pascal|title=Test Your Strength|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1998192,00.html|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-01-26]]}}</ref>

It took nearly 20 years for Boosey & Hawkes to regain the leading position in the international music scene that it has today.<ref name="Telegraph: Boosey & Hawkes"/> It claims to be the largest specialist [[classical music]] publisher in the world.<ref name="Boosey website: Welcome">{{cite web|last=Minch|first=John|title=Welcome to our World of Music|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/corporate/|publisher=Boosey & Hawkes|accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>

==The company today==
In 2001, Boosey & Hawkes was put up for sale after accounting irregularities were discovered in its [[Chicago]] instrument-distribution business, leading to <U+00A3>13m worth of sales being written off, a plummeting share price, and the company's near-bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Osborne|first=Alistair|title=Bad Vibes from Chicago Shake Boosey & Hawkes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2000/11/17/cnboos17.xml|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=[[2001-03-21]]}} {{cite news|last=Osborne|first=Alistair|title=Chicago Blues for Boosey|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2000/09/13/cnboos13.xml|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=[[2001-03-21]]}}</ref> It was eventually bought by [[venture capital]]ists HgCapital in 2003 for <U+00A3>40 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boosey & Hawkes Stays Independent|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/corporate/saledetail.asp|publisher=Boosey & Hawkes|date=[[2003-11-21]]|accessdate=2007-05-29}} {{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|title=Buyout Saves Music Publisher Boosey's Independence|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1092558,00.html|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2003-11-25]]}}</ref>

On [[11 February]] [[2003]], Boosey & Hawkes sold its musical instrument division, which included [[clarinet]] maker [[Buffet Crampon]] and [[guitar]] manufacturer [[H<U+00F6>fner]], to [[The Music Group]], a company formed by rescue buyout specialists Rutland Fund Management, for <U+00A3>33.2 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fagan|first=Mary|title=Boosey Nears Sale of Instruments Division|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2002/08/25/cnboos25.xml|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=[[2002-08-24]]}} {{cite news|last=Osborne|first=Alistair|title=Boosey Plucks <U+00A3>33.2m for Instruments|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2003/02/12/cnboos12.xml|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=[[2003-02-11]]}} {{cite news|last=Wray|first=Richard|title=Boosey & Hawkes Sells Instruments Arm for <U+00A3>33.2m|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,893744,00.html|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2003-02-12]]}}</ref> An archive of musical instruments manufactured or collected by the company throughout its history was passed to the [[Horniman Museum]] in [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], [[South London]].<ref name="Guardian: Test Your Strength"/>

Today, partly due to the foresight or business acumen of Ralph Hawkes, the company owns the [[copyright]]s or agencies to much major 20th century music, including works by Bart<U+00F3>k, [[Leonard Bernstein]], Britten (notably all his output between 1938 and 1963),<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/> Copland, Kod<U+00E1>ly, Mahler, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Richard Strauss and Stravinsky.<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/><ref name="Boosey website: Welcome"/> It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers, such as [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Louis Andriessen]], Sir [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Unsuk Chin]], [[Michael Daugherty]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Henryk G<U+00F3>recki]], [[Heinz Karl Gruber]], [[Robin Holloway]], [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[James MacMillan (musician)|James MacMillan]], [[Olga Neuwirth]], [[Kurt Schwertsik]] and [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=An Unrivalled Catalogue|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/corporate/overview/unrivalledcat.asp|publisher=Boosey & Hawkes|accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> The company's New York branch has developed its own catalogue emphasizing the works of American composers, including [[Elliott Carter]], [[David Del Tredici]], [[Walter Piston]], [[Ned Rorem]] and [[Steve Reich]].<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/>

295 Regent Street, which was the home of Boosey & Company since 1874 and of Boosey & Hawkes' publishing business and music shop from 1930, was finally given up by the company in 2005 which then relocated to Aldwych House.<ref name="Boosey: Locations"/> Boosey & Hawkes Music Shop claims to have the UK's largest selection of printed music from all publishers, and operates a worldwide [[mail order]] service.<ref name="Boosey website: Wealth of Music">{{cite web|title=A Wealth of Music|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/corporate/overview/wealthofmusic.asp|publisher=Boosey & Hawkes|accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>

The company also has a major division, BooseyMedia, that commissions and produces music for radio, television and advertising [[jingle]]s, and the administration of [[copyright]]s owned by media companies. Its Cavendish Production Music Library provides ready-made [[production music]] for television, radio and audio-visual use.<ref name="Boosey website: Wealth of Music"/>

The Boosey & Hawkes group has branches in five countries on four continents,<ref name="Grove: Boosey & Hawkes"/> including companies in Germany (Bote & Bock GmbH & Co. KG and Anton J.

==Parodies==
The company was lampooned by ''[[The Goon Show]]'' as "Goosy and Borks" in their episode, "[[Lurgy]] Strikes Britain", as well as by musical [[Parody|parodist]] [[Peter Schickele]] who named one of the friends of fictional [[composer]] [[P.D.Q. Bach]] Jonathan "Boozey" Hawkes. Somewhat more recondite was the punning reference delivered in one of [[Gerard Hoffnung]]'s parody concerts: "If Boosey's will Hawk it, [[Schott Music|Schott]]'s will [[Michael Tippett|Tippett]]".
