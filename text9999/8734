'''William Henry "Bill" Andrews''', [[Ph.D.]] (born 10 December 1951 in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]] and [[Gerontology|gerontologist]] whose career has centered on searching for a cure for human [[aging]].

==Early life and education==

Andrews was born on December 10, 1951, to television producer [[Ralph Andrews]] and Margaret Andrews. As a child, Andrews was told by his father that he should grow up to become a doctor and find a cure for aging.<ref name="Rejuvenation" /> Andrews graduated from [[Cate School]] in 1971, from [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1976, and earned his Ph.D. in Molecular and Population Genetics at the [[University of Georgia]] in 1981.

==Career==

===Early career (1981<U+2013>1999)===

Andrews first worked at the [[biotechnology]] company Armos Corporation, which was later purchased by Codon Corporation, which in turn was purchased by [[Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals|Berlex Biosciences]], now known as Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. In 1993, Andrews convinced Berlex to send him to an anti-aging conference at [[Lake Tahoe, Nevada]], where he met Calvin Harley of [[Geron Corporation]].<ref name="Rejuvenation" /> Harley gave a speech on the subject of [[telomere]]s and [[telomerase]], their discovery in the organism [[Tetrahymena]] by [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] and [[Carol Greider]], and on the possible connection between telomeres and aging. Harley mentioned that no one had yet been successful in cloning telomerase in human beings.

After the speech, Andrews approached Harley and told him that he could clone human telomerase for Geron in three months. Harley took him up on this offer and hired Andrews as Geron's Director of Molecular Biology. Three months and seventeen days later, Andrews' team successfully cloned the RNA component of telomerase ("[[Telomerase RNA component|hTR]]").<ref name="Rejuvenation" /> For this discovery, Andrews and members of his team were awarded second place for "National Inventor of the Year" in 1997 by the [[Intellectual Property Owners Association]]<ref>{{Citation | year = 1997 | title = Awards, Appointments, Announcements | publisher = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/10/687.full}}</ref> (first place having been awarded for the invention of [[protease inhibitors]].<ref>{{Citation | year = 2005 | title = Past Winners| publisher = Intellectual Property Organization | url = http://www.ipo.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=7756}}</ref>) Andrews' team later co-discovered the [[protein]] component of human telomerase ("[[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|hTERT]]") as well.<ref name="Rejuvenation" /><ref name="2011 Patent"/>

Further experiments by Andrews and his team demonstrated that the protein component of telomerase was inducible, and that when the gene for that component was inserted into normal human skin cells, they could divide past the [[Hayflick limit]] and essentially stopped exhibiting replicative senescence, a likely cause of aging. Years later, these cells were deemed immortal. Typically, the only immortal human cells are our [[germline]] and most [[cancer]]s.<ref name="Rejuvenation" />

===Sierra Sciences (1999<U+2013>present)===

In 1999, Andrews founded [[Sierra Sciences]] in [[Reno, Nevada]], to capitalize on his discoveries at Geron, with the specific goal of curing human aging. Underwritten by investors Richard Offerdahl and [[Pierluigi Zappacosta]], Andrews assembled a team to search for a small molecule that would bind to the telomerase [[repressor]], causing the body to constitutively express telomerase in the presence of that molecule.<ref name = "Popsci" />

From 1999 to 2005, Sierra Sciences' focus was to identify the telomerase repressor protein, in the hopes that a drug could be specifically designed to bind to it. During this time frame, Geron Corporation discovered [[TA-65]], a small-molecule telomerase activator derived from [[Astragalus membranaceus]]. Sierra Sciences tested its efficacy,<ref>{{Citation | year = 2011 | title = A Natural Product Telomerase Activator As Part of a Health Maintenance Program | publisher = [[Rejuvenation Research]] | url = http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/rej.2010.1085}}</ref> and shortly thereafter, Andrews became the first paying customer to take the supplement.<ref name="Popsci" />

In 2005, Andrews shelved Sierra Sciences' efforts to identify the telomerase repressor protein, instead switching to the "brute force" strategy of developing assays to screen large numbers of semi-random chemicals to determine whether they induced telomerase.<ref name="Rejuvenation" /> In November 2007, after nearly two years of screening, Sierra Sciences discovered the chemical C0056784,<ref name = "Popsci" /> which induces approximately 6% as much telomerase as is found in the immortal cancer cell line [[HeLa]].<ref name="Achievements">{{Citation | year = 2011 | title = Sierra Sciences: Achievements and Intellectual Property.| publisher = [[Sierra Sciences]] | url = http://www.sierrasci.com/research/index.html}}</ref>

In 2008, using C0057684 as a positive control, Sierra Sciences developed a much more sensitive [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|real-time PCR]] based [[high-throughput screening]] assay, the "hTERT RT-PCR assay," with which they were able to screen 4,000 chemicals per week.<ref name = "Achievements" /> In 2010, Andrews and Sierra Sciences entered into an agreement with John Anderson, founder of [[Isagenix International]], to use this assay to screen natural ingredients for telomerase activity. A year later, based on the assay's results, Isagenix launched Product B, a telomere-supporting nutraceutical.<ref>{{Citation | year = 2011 | title = The Vision | publisher = Stayoung.info | url = http://www.stayoung.info/the-vision}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Andrews is an accomplished [[ultramarathon]] runner, frequently running races as long as 138 miles long.<ref name="Popsci" /> In 2008<ref>{{Citation | year = 2008 | title = Badwater 2008 results | publisher = Ultra Signup | url = http://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=3874}}</ref> and 2009,<ref>{{Citation | year = 2009 | title = 2009 Badwater Ultramarathon Results | publisher = AdventureCORPS | url = http://dbase.adventurecorps.com/results.php?bw_eid=49&bwr=Go}}</ref> Andrews successfully completed the [[Badwater Ultramarathon]], a 135-mile race through [[Death Valley]] in temperatures exceeding 120 <U+00B0>F (49 <U+00B0>C).
