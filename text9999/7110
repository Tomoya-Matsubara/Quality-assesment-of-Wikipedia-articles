'''New York State Route 245''' is a [[state highway]] in the [[Finger Lakes]] District of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]]. The southern terminus of the route is at [[New York State Route 21|NY 21]] in [[Naples (village), New York|Naples]]. The northern terminus is at [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]], [[U.S. Route 20 (New York)|U.S. Route 20]] and [[New York State Route 14A|NY 14A]] west of [[Geneva (city), New York|Geneva]]. From Geneva to Naples, NY 245 traverses the land from the north end of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] to the south end of [[Canandaigua Lake]] in roughly a northeast to southwest direction.

NY 245 begins at an intersection with NY 21 immediately north of Naples in [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]].<ref name=rmcn>{{cite map|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|title=New York|year=2006|cartography=[[Rand McNally]]}}</ref> The route heads to the northeast along the base of a series of mountains delimiting the [[Canandaigua Lake]] valley, entering [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]] before following the valley surrounding the [[West River]] at a fork in the primary valley near the southern end of Canandaigua Lake. NY 245 follows the eastern edge of the valley to [[Middlesex, New York|Middlesex]], where it intersects [[New York State Route 364|NY 364]] in the village center. NY 245 and NY 364 run concurrent for a block before NY 364 splits from NY 245 to ascend the eastern edge of the valley and continue towards [[Potter, New York|Potter]]. North of Middlesex, the valley becomes less prominent as NY 245 progresses northward.<ref name=rmcn /><ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|title=Middlesex, New York Quadrangle|year=1942|series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic)}}</ref> Near the Ontario County line, NY 245 turns northeast to serve the dual-county village of [[Rushville, New York|Rushville]]. Within the village, NY 245 meets [[New York State Route 247|NY 247]]. The two routes embark on an overlap northward into Ontario County.<ref name=rmcn /><ref name=rushville>{{cite map|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|title=Rushville, New York Quadrangle|year=1978|series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic)}}</ref>

Shortly into Ontario County, NY 247 separates from NY 245, taking a due north alignment through the town of [[Gorham, New York|Gorham]]. NY 245 continues eastward through predominantly hilly terrain, passing through the hamlets of Gorham (where it crosses Flint Creek) and Stanley (centered around a former junction between the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] and [[Lehigh Valley Railroad|Lehigh Valley]] railroads adjacent to NY 245) before meeting [[New York State Route 14A|NY 14A]] at a rural junction in the town of [[Seneca, New York|Seneca]]. The routes merge, forming a concurrency northward to the outskirts of [[Geneva (city), New York|Geneva]], where both routes end at the concurrent routes of US 20 and NY 5.<ref name=rmcn /><ref name=rushville /><ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|title=Stanley, New York Quadrangle|year=1952|series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic)}}</ref>

==History==
NY 245 was originally assigned to what is now [[New York State Route 39|NY 39]] between [[Pike (village), New York|Pike]] and [[Leicester (town), New York|Leicester]] as part of the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]].<ref name=gb>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930-31 and 1931-32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> Between 1938 and 1946, the routings of NY 245 and NY 39 east of Pike were swapped,<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Green Book'', 1938-39 edition, (William A. Thbodeau, 1939).</ref><ref name=1946rmcn>{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/randmcnally_ra_1946_005.html|title=Rand McNally Road Atlas|year=1946|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> placing NY 39 on its modern alignment<ref name=1946rmcn /> and routing NY 245 along what is now Griffith Road to [[Portageville, New York|Portageville]], [[New York State Route 436|NY 436]] from Portageville to [[Dansville, Livingston County, New York|Dansville]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terraserver-usa.com/image.aspx?T=2&S=15&Z=17&X=114&Y=736&W=3&qs=%7cpike%7cny%7c|title=Topographic map of Pike, New York and vicinity|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=1962|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> [[New York State Route 63|NY 63]] from Dansville to [[Wayland (village), New York|Wayland]], [[New York State Route 21|NY 21]] from Wayland to [[Naples (village), New York|Naples]], and its current alignment from Naples to Geneva.<ref name=1946rmcn />

In 1972, NY 245 was truncated to its current western terminus in Naples. The former routing of NY 245 between Pike and Dansville was redesignated as NY 436 while the segment from Dansville from Wayland became part of an extended NY 63. The Wayland-Naples portion remained part of NY 21, which NY 245 overlapped between the two villages.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Humble Oil & Refining Company]]|title=New York|year=1971|cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref><ref name=1972map>{{cite map|publisher=[[Exxon]]|title=Eastern United States|edition=1972-73|year=1972|cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> By the following year, NY 245 was extended back to Wayland via NY 21. Instead of continuing west as it did pre-1972, NY 245 followed then-[[U.S. Route 15]] (now [[New York State Route 15|NY 15]]) and NY 21 south to what is now [[Interstate 390]] exit 3 south of the village. NY 245 turned west onto the partially-completed freeway (only Wayland to Dansville had been built at the time), following the expressway to NY 36 near [[Dansville Municipal Airport]], where NY 245, as well as the freeway, ended at what was then an at-grade intersection near the current exit 5.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Standard Oil]]|title=Northeastern United States with Interstate Strip Maps|edition=1973-74|year=1973|cartography=[[Universal Printing Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|title=Dansville, New York Quadrangle|year=1978|series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic)}}</ref> The length of the freeway was formerly designated as [[New York State Route 401|NY 401]] before becoming part of NY 245.<ref name=1972map /> By 1976, NY 245 was truncated on its western end to Naples while the freeway became I-390. The portion in between remained part of NY 15 (from I-390 to Wayland) and NY 21.<ref name="1976map">{{cite map|publisher=[[New York State Thruway Authority]]|title=New York Thruway|year=1976|edition=13th|cartography=[[New York State Thruway Authority]]}}</ref>
