'''''Halloween''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Remake#Reimagining|remake]] of the 1978 [[slasher film|slasher]] [[Halloween (1978 film)|film of the same name]]. The film was written, produced, and directed by [[Rob Zombie]]. The film stars [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Samuel J. Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]], [[Tyler Mane]] as the adult [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], and [[Scout Taylor-Compton]] as [[Laurie Strode]]; [[Daeg Faerch]] portrays a ten year old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's "reimagining" follows the premise of [[John Carpenter]]'s original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.   

Working from Carpenter's advice to "make [the film] his own",<ref name="Make own">{{cite web |url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/338/4589/Zombie,-Rob.html |title=Rob Zombie to Re-Make ''Halloween'' |publisher=TheGauntlet.com|date=2006-06-04 |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> Zombie chose to develop the film as both a prequel and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply refilming the same scenes.

==Plot==
<!--Please do not expand this plot summary. It is not necessary to mention every single detail which happens in the film. ATTENTION, please do NOT add information for some unverified, leaked draft of the movie. This plot reflects what is in theaters!-->
On [[Halloween]] in [[Haddonfield, Illinois]], having already shown signs of [[Psychopathy|psychopathic tendencies]], ten year old [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] ([[Daeg Faerch]]) murders his sister [[Judith Myers|Judith]] ([[Hanna R. Hall]]), her boyfriend [[List of characters in the Halloween series#Judith's boyfriend/Steven "Steve" Haley|Steve]] ([[Adam Weisman]]), his mother<U+2019>s boyfriend Ronnie ([[William Forsythe]]), and a school bully ([[Daryl Sabara]]). After the longest trial in the state<U+2019>s history, Michael is found guilty of [[first degree murder]] and sent to [[Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium|Smith's Grove Sanitarium]] under the care of [[child psychologist]] [[Samuel J. Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]). 
Michael initially cooperates with Dr. Loomis, claiming no memory of the killings; his mother, [[List of characters in the Halloween series#Donald Myers & Edith Myers (Deborah Myers)|Deborah]] ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]), visits him regularly. After a year, Michael becomes fixated on his [[papier-m<U+00E2>ch<U+00E9>]] masks, closing himself off from everyone, even his mother. When Michael kills a nurse ([[Sybil Danning]]) during one of her visits, Deborah can no longer handle the situation and commits [[suicide]]. For the next fifteen years, Michael ([[Tyler Mane]]) continues making his masks and not speaking to anyone. Dr. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts to move on with his life and closes Michael<U+2019>s case. Later, while being prepared for transfer to maximum security, Michael escapes Smith<U+2019>s Grove, killing the sanitarium guards and a truck driver ([[Ken Foree]]) for his clothes, and heads to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his old home, now abandoned, and finds a kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister. 

The story shifts to [[Laurie Strode]] ([[Scout Taylor-Compton]]), and her friends [[Annie Brackett]] ([[Danielle Harris]]) and [[Lynda Van Der Klok]] ([[Kristina Klebe]]) on Halloween. Throughout the day, Laurie witnesses Michael watching her from a distance. That night, she heads to the Doyle residence to watch their son [[Tommy Doyle|Tommy]] ([[Skyler Gisondo]]). Meanwhile, Lynda meets with her boyfriend [[List of characters in the Halloween series#Bob Simms|Bob]] (Nick Mennell) at Michael's childhood home. Michael appears, murders them, and then heads to the Strode home, where he murders [[List of characters in the Halloween series#Morgan & Pamela Strode|Laurie's parents]]. Having been alerted to Michael's escape, Dr. Loomis comes to Haddonfield looking for Michael. After obtaining a handgun, Loomis attempts to warn [[List of characters in the Halloween series#Sheriff Leigh Brackett|Sheriff Brackett]] ([[Brad Dourif]]) that Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Brackett and Dr. Loomis head to the Strode home, with Brackett explaining along the way that Laurie is actually Michael Myers' baby sister. 

Meanwhile, Annie convinces Laurie to babysit [[Lindsey Wallace]] (Jenny Gregg Stewart), a girl Annie is supposed to be watching, long enough so she can have sex with her boyfriend [[List of characters in the Halloween series#Paul Freedman|Paul]] ([[Max Van Ville]]). Annie and Paul return to the Wallace home; during sex, Michael kills Paul and attacks Annie. Bringing Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie on the floor, bloodied but alive, and calls 911. She is attacked by Michael, who chases her back to the Doyle home. Sheriff Brackett and Loomis hear the 911 call and head to the Wallace residence. Michael kidnaps Laurie, and takes her back to his home. Michael approaches Laurie and tries to show her that she is his younger sister. Unable to understand, Laurie grabs Michael's knife and stabs him before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but is repeatedly shot by Dr. Loomis. Laurie and Loomis are just about to leave when Michael grabs Laurie and heads back to the house. Loomis intervenes, but Michael attacks him by squeezing Loomis's skull with his hands. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs; she is chased by Michael, who, after cornering her on a balcony, charges her head-on and knocks both of them over the railing. Laurie finds herself on top of a bleeding Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she repeatedly pulls the trigger until the gun finally goes off just as Michael's hand grips Laurie's wrist.

==Production==
===Development===
On June 4, 2006, [[Dimension Films|Dimension]] announced that [[Rob Zombie]], director of ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'', would be creating the next installment in the ''Halloween'' franchise.<ref name="Zombie">{{cite web | url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9/zombierelease.html | publisher=HalloweenMovies.com | title=New <U+201C>Halloween<U+201D> film |date=2006-06-04 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> The plan was for Zombie to hold many positions in the production; he would write, direct, produce, and serve as music supervisor.<ref name="Zombie"/> Bob Weinstein approached him about making the film, and Zombie, who was a fan of the original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', and friend of [[John Carpenter]], jumped at the chance to make a ''Halloween'' film for Dimension Studios.<ref name="Zombie"/> Before Dimension went public with the news, Zombie felt obligated to inform John Carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film.<ref name="plot-interview">{{cite web | title=Halloween: On Set With Director Rob Zombie! |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/354 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071211100941/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/354 |archivedate=2007-12-11 |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting |date=2007-03-19 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref> Carpenter's request was for Zombie to "make it his own".<ref name="Make own"/> During a June 16, 2006 interview, Zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept. He insisted that there would be considerable original content in the new film, as opposed to mere rehashed material.<ref name="Zombie interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/h9_lobby.html |publisher=HalloweenMovies.com |title=Interview with Rob |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>  The [[BBC]] reported that the new film would disregard the numerous sequels that followed ''Halloween''.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |title=Zombie 'to resurrect Halloween' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5047704.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

His intention is to reinvent Michael Myers, because, in his opinion, the character, along with [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Jason Voorhees]], and [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]], has become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary.<ref name="MTV interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/flickd/z/rob_zombie_061026/ |title=Evil Reborn: Zombie resurrects a horror classic |publisher=[[MTV]] |accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref><ref name="bbc"/> The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael Myers' [[back story]]. A deeper back story would add "new life" to the character, as Zombie put it.<ref name="Zombie interview"/> Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film.<ref name="MTV interview 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1554005/20070306/story.jhtml |title=Zombie Kills 'Halloween' Theme Song, Revokes Myers' Driver's License |publisher=MTV |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be truer to what a [[psychopath]] really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He wants the young Michael to have [[charisma]], which would be  projected onto the adult Michael. Zombie has decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield should be more ambiguous. As Zombie explains, "was he trying to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?"<ref name="plot-interview"/>

Moreover, Michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield.<ref name="MTV interview 2"/> Zombie also wants the Dr. Loomis character to be more intertwined with that of Michael Myers; Zombie said that the character's role in the original was "showing up merely to say something dramatic".<ref name="MTV interview"/> Although Zombie has added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched).<ref name="Zombie interview"/> Production officially began on January 29 2007.<ref name="breakdown">{{cite web | title=Official ''Halloween'' Casting Breakdown, Synopsis |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7683 |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask. Zombie commented, "It looks perfect, exactly like the original. Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7927 | title=The Big Question Answered ''Halloween'' | date=2007-01-04 |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting |accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref> Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original ''Halloween''.<ref name="MTV interview 2"/>

==Release==
Approximately four days before the theatrical release of the film, a [[workprint]] version of the film appeared online and was circulated around various [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters.<ref>{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Cline |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/08/rob_zombies_halloween_remake_l.html|title=Rob Zombie's <U+2018>Halloween<U+2019> Remake Leaks, Rob Zombie Shrugs|publisher=[[New York Entertainment]]|date=2007-08-28|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged the same way director [[Eli Roth]] attributed the financial failure of his film, ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', to the leaking of a workprint version of that film.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Sciretta |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/08/28/rob-zombies-halloween-workprint-leaked-online/|title=Rob Zombie<U+2019>s Halloween Workprint Leaked Online|publisher=Slashfilm|date=[[2007-08-28]]|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> [[Dark Horizons]] webmaster, Garth Franklin, notes that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what things were changed after the test screenings in June 2007.

Peter Hartlaub, of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', felt Zombie was successful in both "[putting] his own spin on ''Halloween'', while at the same time paying tribute to Carpenter's film"; he thought Zombie managed to make Michael Myers almost "sympathetic" as a child, but that the last third of the film felt more like a montage of scenes with ''Halloween'' slipping into "slasher-film logic".<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Hartlaub |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/08/31/DDHPRT64J.DTL&type=movies|title=Zombie's 'Halloween' follows Michael Myers' psychotic roots|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> Nathan Lee of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' disagreed in part with Harlaub, feeling that ''Halloween'' may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for Michael Myers, but that it did succeeded in "[deeping] Carpenter's vision without rooting out its fear".<ref>{{cite news |author=Nathan Lee |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011072501rn_1/www.villagevoice.com/film/0736,lee,77659,20.html|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0736,lee,77659,20.html|title=''Halloween'' review |publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|archivedate=2007-10-11|date=2007-08-28|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> The ''ViewLondon''<U+2019>s Matthew Turner believed the first half of the film, which featured the prequel elements of Michael as a child, were better played than the remake elements of the second half.

''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' critic Jack Matthews believed the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks<U+2014>focusing more on enhancing the "imagery of violence"<U+2014>than real attempts to scare the audience; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jack Matthews|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/01/2007-09-01_rob_zombie_hacks_away_at_halloween_horro.html|title=Rob Zombie hacks away at 'Halloween' horror classic|publisher=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> Dennis Harvey, from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dennis Harvey|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934509.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=''Variety'' review|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=[[2007-08-27]]|accessdate=2008-04-27}}</ref> In contrast, Rossiter Drake of ''The Examiner'' applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a "compelling take on the mythology" that managed to be "unique" and "shocking" at the same time.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rossiter Drake|url=http://www.examiner.com/a-910880~_Halloween___Once_more__with_flaying.html|title='Halloween': Once more, with flaying|publisher=The Examiner |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> In agreement with other critics, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's [[Kim Newman]] felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film "[fell] flat" when it came to delivering suspense or anything "remotely scary"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the "dogged pschiatrist".<ref>{{cite news|author=Kim Newman|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=134964|title=''Empire'' review|publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> Ben Walter, of ''[[Time Out|Time Out London]]'', felt Zombie added "surprising realism" to the development of Michael Myers<U+2019> psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film<U+2019>s "suspense and playfulness" with a convincing display of "black-blooded brutality".<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Walter|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84559/halloween.html|title=Halloween review|publisher=Time Out London|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref>

Frank Scheck, of the ''Hollywood Reporter'', believed that even though Zombie's remake of Carpenter's ''Halloween'' was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character.<ref>{{cite news|author=Frank Scheck|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/home_entertainment/dvd_reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=10337|title=Halloween review|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> By contrast, [[TV Guide]]'s Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more in the footsteps of [[Wes Craven]] and [[Tobe Hooper]]'s "savage, greasy-haired '70s" films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience has grown accustomed to the recent "[[Splatter film#Torture porn|torture porn]]" horror films.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ken Fox |url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/halloween/review/289890 |title=''Halloween'' review|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref> Bill Gibron, of [[PopMatters]], believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield<U+2014>with Michael acting as a true "boogeyman"<U+2014>Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his "desire for death".<ref>{{cite news|author=Bill Gibron|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/47762/short-cuts-in-theaters-halloween-2007/|title=Short Cuts - In Theaters: Halloween (2007) |publisher=PopMatters.com|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref>
