The '''Tragedy of Otranto''' took place on 28 March 1997 when the Albanian ship ''Kateri i Rad<U+00EB>s'' sank in a collision with the [[Italy|Italian]] naval vessel ''Sibilia'' in the [[Strait of Otranto]] and as many as 83 [[Albania]]ns lost their lives. The emigrants had been part of a large migration of Albanians to Italy following the [[Lottery Uprising]] in Albania, a popular uprising that took place after the collapse of several investment [[pyramid scheme]]s. In order to prevent the unauthorized entry of illegals migrants into Italy, the [[Italian Navy]] set up a procedure to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered, implementing a ''de facto'' blockade.

In proceeding to carry out a boarding, the Italian vessel ''Sibilia'' collided with ''Kateri i Rad<U+00EB>s'' and capsized it, resulting in the Albanian deaths. The captains of both ships were held responsible for "shipwreck and multiple manslaughter".<ref name=Ryan294/> The event raised questions over the extent of power that a state may exercise to protect itself from unauthorized entry. Arguments were presented that a state must limit coercive actions that are disproportionate to the risk of unauthorized entry. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] criticized the Italian blockade as illegal since it had been established solely through an intergovernmental agreement with Albania.

==Background==
After the fall of communism in [[Albania]] in 1990, thousands of Albanians travelled by ship or boat to [[Italy]]. One of the early migrations involved the landing of 640 [[Albanians]] in [[Otranto]] on the south-eastern tip of the [[Italian peninsula]], and received help from the local population. Italian civil servants were soon sent to Otranto to observe the situation. This openness to the Albanians resulted in 20,000 more Albanians landing in [[Brindisi]] after a few days, 17,000 landing in [[Bari]] in August 1991, and 15,000 in early March 1997. Much of the Italian media portrayed the situation as "barbarians" invading Italian soil.<ref name=Guild>{{Cite book|last=Guild|first=Elspeth|coauthors=Minderhoud, Paul|title=Immigration and criminal law in the European Union: the legal measures and social consequences of criminal law in member states on trafficking and smuggling in human beings|volume=9|series=Immigration and asylum law and policy in Europe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1uCrJ8ykkOMC&dq=otranto+1997&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=2006|isbn=90-04-15064-1|page=182}}</ref> As a consequence of the [[Gulf War]], Italian opinion-makers voiced concerns regarding the alleged "[[Islamic]] danger"<ref name=Albahari5/> of the migration.

In 1997, a [[1997 rebellion in Albania|crisis erupted in Albania]] after the collapse of several investment [[pyramid scheme]]s which resulted in social deterioration in the country in the beginning of March. An imposition of a curfew and a state of emergency on 2 March provoked a popular rebellion, causing concern in Italy which feared an expansion of the conflict into the [[Balkan]] area and its exposure to the risk of massive migration flows. Albanian migration to Italy reached its maximum intensity in the latter half of March, bringing great pressure to Italian accommodation centers and provoking a strong reaction in Italian public opinion.<ref name=Ryan293>{{Cite book|last=Ryan|first=Bernard|coauthors=Mitsilegas, Valsamis|title=Extraterritorial immigration control: legal challenges|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GjqRfqetCtkC&dq=otranto+1997&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|isbn= 90-04-17233-5|page=293}}</ref> Italy had been operating under a bilateral agreement with Albania to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered<ref name="Gibney"/> starting on 3 April 1997 and Albanian would-be migrants going to Italy would be sent back to Albania, in exchange for Italian financial, police, and humanitarian assistance to the

==Sinking==

The incident happened on 28 March 1997 in the Strait of Otranto when the [[Italian Navy]] vessel ''Sibilia'' collided with the Albanian ship ''Kateri i Rad<U+00EB>s'' which had left from the Albanian port city of [[Vlor<U+00EB>]] with 142 people on board.<ref name="Corriere"/><ref name=Albahari6/> The ''Sibilla'' sought to stop and inspect the ship suspected of containing irregular migrants. The vessel instead ended up colliding with the ship and sinking it.<ref name=Gibney>{{Cite book|last=Gibney|first=Mark|coauthors=Skogly, Sigrun|title=Universal human rights and extraterritorial obligations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kWAR32qmC2AC&dq=otranto+tragedy&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2010|isbn=0-8122-4215-7|page=72}}</ref> According to Italian authorities, there was no intention to cause the collision. The ''Zefiro'' first approached and identified the ''Kateri i Rad<U+00EB>s'' as a motorboat with approximately 30 civilians on board. The motorboat continued toward Italy even though a stop order issued by the ''Zefiro''.<ref name=Ryan294/> This happened around 4:30 PM, near the Albanian island [[Sazan]].<ref name=Albahari6>{{citation|last=Albahari|first=Maurizio|title=Death and the Moral State: Making Borders and Sovereignty at the Southern Edges of Europe|url=http://www.ccis-ucsd.org/PUBLICATIONS/CCIS%20Albahari%20death%20and%20the%20moral%20state%20june%2015%202006.pdf|publisher=Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, University of California, San Diego|year=2006|month=June|page=6|accessdate=26 January 2010}}</ref> ''Sibilia'' then took over the operation and during its maneuvers, the Italian ship caused the ''Kateri i Rad<U+00EB>s'' to turn which resulted in subsequent deaths.<ref name=Ryan294>{{Cite book|last=Ryan|first=Bernard|coauthors=Mitsilegas, Valsamis|title=Extraterritorial immigration control: legal challenges|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GjqRfqetCtkC&dq=otranto+1997&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|isbn= 90-04-17233-5|page=294}}</ref> After the Albanian ship was capsized, the ''Sibilia'' allegedly left and came back approximately 20 minutes later.<ref name=Albahari6/> The bodies of at least 52 who lost their lives<ref name=Ryan294/> were recovered.<ref name="Corriere">{{cite web|last=Vulpio|first=Carlo|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/marzo/18/Strage_Otranto_indagati_due_ammiragli_co_0_98031814222.shtml|title= Strage di Otranto, indagati due ammiragli |date=18 March 1998|publisher=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> The total number of dead is assumed to be 83.<ref name="Gibney"/> The survivors were taken to the [[Apulia]]n port of Brindisi, where they arrived at 2:45 AM. They were then put on a bus, and taken to an immigration center to be identified.<ref name=Albahari7/> On 29 and 30 March 1997, news of the disaster made it to the first page of major Italian newspapers, relating the sense of gravity of the incident, which reported it as either a collision or a ramming.<ref name=Albahari8/>

==Legal proceedings==
The accident raised questions about the extent of power that the state may use to protect from unauthorized entry. Although undisputed that the sinking was unintentional, controversy exists over whether it was a result of dangerous maneuvering, which was disproportionate in relation to the stopping of the ship. Authors argue that there is an obligation for the state to limit coercive actions which are disproportionate to the risk of intrusion.<ref name=Ryan294/>  The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] criticized the Italian blockade as <U+201C>illegal<U+201D><ref name=Albahari8/>  since Italy established it only through a bilateral, intergovernmental agreement with Albania.<ref name=Albahari8/>

The ''Xhavara et. al v. Italy and Albania'' case was held to be inadmissible because of non-exhaustible national remedies.<ref name="Gibney"/> The [[European Court of Human Rights]], which held the case, assumed jurisdiction relying on the bilateral agreement between Albania and Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geiss|first=Robin|coauthor=Petrig, Anna|title=Piracy and armed robbery at sea: the legal framework for counter-piracy operations in Somalia and the Gulf of Aden|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tDIywglWk5UC|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0-19-960952-7|page=114}}</ref> The ship was recovered {{convert|35|mi|km}} from the Italian coast, no more than {{convert|10|mi|km}} to {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the Albanian coast within Albanian territorial waters.<ref name=Albahari7>{{citation|last=Albahari|first=Maurizio|title=Death and the Moral State: Making Borders and Sovereignty at the Southern Edges of Europe|url=http://www.ccis-ucsd.org/PUBLICATIONS/CCIS%20Albahari%20death%20and%20the%20moral%20state%20june%2015%202006.pdf|publisher=Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, University of California, San Diego|year=2006|month=June|page=7|accessdate=26 January 2010}}</ref> The court held Italy responsible for the incident since it was considered to have exercised jurisdiction. Italy was also held responsible for holding an investigation of the deaths, a requirement which was considered to have been fulfilled by the public manslaughter proceedings held against the captain of the Italian vessel.<ref name="Gibney"/> By the end of eight years of proceedings, the Court of Brindisi convicted the Italian and Albanian captains together of "shipwreck and multiple manslaughter"<ref name=Ryan294/> with the first to three years in prison and the second to four. Responsibility for the "accident"<ref name=Ryan294/> was attributed to both and was relegated to the individual level.<ref name=Ryan294/> The larger chain of command, legal framework, discourses, and established practices which resulted in the sinking have not been judicially investigated.<ref name=Albahari8/>

==Remembrance==
The tragedy became part of the Albanian folk song repertoire relating to the migration of Albanians abroad. The leading figures of this practice were local intellectuals called ''rapsods'' related the ''mythistory'' of ''kurbet'' before [[World War II]] with the migration. They make use of metaphors and performance devices taken from oral folk poetry and death laments which react on the migrations to fix them in the memory of the community. This became a tool for responding to the loss of life for the tragedy of Otranto and other tragic events.<ref>{{citation|last=Pistrick|first=Eckehard|title=Singing back the kurbetlli <U+2013> Responses to migration in Albanian folk culture as a culturally innovative practice|url=http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2010_2/Anthropological_Notebooks_XVI_2_Pistrick.pdf|accessdate=25 January 2012|series=Anthropological Notebooks|volume=16|page=29|ISSN=1408-032X|publisher=Slovene Anthropological Society|year=2010}}</ref> 

Parts of ''Kateri i Rad<U+00EB>s'' were transported to a concrete platform in the port of Otranto as a monument to the tragedy. The project cost <U+20AC>150 thousand and was entrusted to the Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos.
