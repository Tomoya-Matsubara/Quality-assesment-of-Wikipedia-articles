"'''Deep Throat'''" is the second episode of the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', which premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on September&nbsp;17, 1993. Written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and directed by [[Daniel Sackheim]], the episode introduced several elements which would become staples of the [[Mythology of The X-Files|series' mythology]].

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) investigate cases linked to the [[paranormal]], called [[X-File]]s. Mulder believes in paranormal phenomena, while the skeptical Scully attempts to discredit them. In this episode, the pair investigate a possible conspiracy in the [[US Air Force]] and Mulder meets a mysterious informant who warns him to stay away from the case. Undeterred, Mulder continues and comes closer to the truth about extraterrestrial life than ever before, only to have his progress taken away from him again.

The episode introduced the [[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]] character, played by [[Jerry Hardin]], who served as Mulder's informant for the first season. The character was inspired by the historical [[Deep Throat]], and served to bridge the gap between the protagonists and the conspirators they would investigate. The episode itself focused on common elements of [[ufology]], with a setting reminiscent of [[Area 51]] and [[Nellis Air Force Base]]. It contained several special effects that Carter later described as "good, given the [series'] restrictions";<ref name="TruthSeasonOne"/> although he singled out the scenes featuring blinking lights as being poorly executed.<ref name="Commentary"/> In its initial American broadcast, "Deep Throat" was viewed by approximately 6.9 million households and attracted positive reviews from critics.

== Plot ==

In southwestern [[Idaho]], near Ellens Air Force Base, [[Military Police Corps (United States Army)|military police]] raid the home of Colonel Robert Budahas, who has stolen a military vehicle and barricaded himself inside. They discover Budahas in his bathroom, trembling and covered in rashes.

Four months later, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) meet at a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] bar to discreetly discuss the Budahas case. Mulder explains that Budahas, a [[test pilot]], has not been seen since the raid and the military will not comment on his condition; the FBI has refused to investigate. Mulder claims that six other pilots are missing at the base, which is subject to rumors about experimental aircraft. While using the bar's restroom, Mulder is approached by a mysterious informant named "[[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]" ([[Jerry Hardin]]), who cautions him to avoid the case. He claims that Mulder is under surveillance, which later proves to be true.

Mulder and Scully travel to Idaho, and meet with Budahas' wife, Anita, who claims her husband exhibited erratic behavior before his disappearance. She takes them to a neighbor whose husband, also a test pilot, is behaving similarly. Scully makes an appointment with base director Colonel Kissell, but he refuses to talk when they stop by his home. The agents subsequently meet local reporter Paul Mossinger, who refers them to the Flying Saucer Restaurant; there they discuss UFOs with the owner, who believes she has witnessed several nearby.

Mulder and Scully visit the base late at night. Scully, who had been sleeping while Mulder keeps watch, is awakened when the car windshield shatters. Shortly afterwards, Mulder shows her a mysterious aircraft performing seemingly impossible maneuvers in the night sky. Mulder and Scully flee when a [[black helicopter]] approaches, seemingly in pursuit of Emil and Zoe, a trespassing teenage couple.

While Mulder treats Emil and Zoe to a meal at a local diner, they tell the pair about the frequent appearances of the lights Mulder saw and of the nearby base from which they believe the UFOs are launched. Meanwhile, Budahas is returned to his home with no memory of what happened. After leaving the diner, Mulder and Scully are confronted by black-suited agents, who destroy the photographs they have taken and order them to leave town.

An indignant Mulder sneaks onto the base with help from Emil and Zoe. He sees a triangular craft fly overhead and then is captured by soldiers who tamper with his memory. Meanwhile, Scully reencounters Mossinger, who she discovers is actually a security operative for the base. At gunpoint, she forces him to guide her to the base and exchanges him for Mulder. Having been denied the truth about the base, Mulder and Scully return to Washington. Days later, Mulder encounters Deep Throat while jogging at a local track. Mulder asks if "they" really are present on Earth; Deep Throat responds that "they have been here for a long, long time".{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=102<U+2013>103}}{{sfn|Lovece|1996|pp=47<U+2013>48}}

This episode marked Hardin's first appearance as Deep Throat. Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] stated that the character was inspired by the historical [[Deep Throat]],{{sfn|Edwards|1996| p=37}} an informant who leaked information about the FBI's investigation of the [[Watergate scandal]] to journalists [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]].{{sfn|Woodward|Bernstein|1974|p=71}} This Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Associate Director]] [[Mark Felt]].<ref name="imtheguy">{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507?printable=true&currentPage=all |title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat {{!}} Politics |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|Cond<U+00E9> Nast]] |first=John D. |last=O'Connor |accessdate=December 30, 2011 |date=May 31, 2005}}</ref> Also cited as an influence was X, the character portrayed by [[Donald Sutherland]] in the 1991 [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''.{{sfn|Edwards|1996| p=37}} Carter created the character to bridge the gap between Mulder and Scully and the shadowy conspirators working against them; describing Deep Throat as a man "who works in some level of government that we have no idea exists".{{sfn|Edwards|1996| p=37}} Carter was drawn to Hardin after seeing him in ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'',{{sfn|Lovece|1996|p=27}} and described the casting as an "easy choice".<ref name="Commentary"/> Hardin flew to Vancouver every few weeks to film his scenes. Carter called Hardin's portrayal "very, very good".<ref name="Commentary"/>

According to Carter, it was evident that ''[[The X-Files]]'' was a "series in making" during this episode.<ref name="Commentary"/> The episode was inspired by common [[ufology]]. Believers in aliens have long thought that [[Nevada]]'s [[Area 51]] and [[Nellis Air Force Base]] have alien technology captured during 1947's [[Roswell UFO incident]]. The name Ellens Air Force Base was derived from the name of Carter's college girlfriend, whose last name was Ellens. The story's military project was inspired by a rumor that the [[United States Air Force]] had started a project named the [[Aurora (aircraft)|Aurora Project]]. Carter said he remembered people talking about this rumor and that its inclusion in the story was a "nod" to it.<ref name="Commentary"/> The surname for the two [[Recurring character|guest character]]s, Budahas, came from a high school friend of Carter. Duchovny and Anderson had never used a gun or held one before, so they were trained on how to hold them properly.<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for "Deep Throat" |location=[[The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1&nbsp;<U+2013> Abduction]] |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

=== Filming ===

[[File:Seth Green Comic-Con 2011.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A smiling bearded man sitting in front of a microphone|[[Seth Green]] ''(pictured in 2011)'' was cast as "stoner kid" Emil, and spent production "goofing off" with star David Duchovny.]]

The scenes in which Mulder infiltrates the air base were shot at a real United States airbase. With a small budget and a television schedule to think of, Carter said the effects seemed "good, given the restrictions" they faced.<ref name="TruthSeasonOne"/> The [[UFO]] was digitally constructed, based around what visual effects supervisor Mat Beck described as a "sort of disco light rig" that was rented from a "party supplier".<ref name="TruthSeasonOne">{{cite video |people=Mat Beck, [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], [[Howard Gordon]], [[Dean Haglund]], [[David Nutter]], Paul Rawbin, [[Daniel Sackheim]], [[Mark Snow]] |title=The Truth About Season One |medium=DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] |location=[[The X-Files (season 1)|The X-Files: The Complete First Season]]}}</ref> Carter commented on Sackheim's direction, noting that the episode was "shot well".<ref name="Commentary"/> Towards the end of filming the night-time scenes, the sun was beginning to rise, forcing crew member John Bartley to rig the angles to keep the scenes as dark as possible.<ref name="Commentary"/> One scene, in which Mulder infiltrates the Air Force base, had already been rewritten to change its daytime setting to night; the rising sun forced the scene to be filmed as originally conceived.{{sfn|Edwards|1996| p=37}}

The house used for the exterior shots of the Budahas family's home was reused in Carter's next series, ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', as the home of protagonist [[Frank Black (character)|Frank Black]]. The house's owner was a [[flight attendant]] who frequently met cast and crew members as they traveled in and out of Vancouver.<ref name="OrderChaos">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], [[Ken Horton]], [[Frank Spotnitz]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Megan Gallagher]], [[David Nutter]], [[Mark Snow]], John Peter Kousakis, Mark Freeborn, [[Robert McLachlan (cinematographer)|Robert McLachlan]], [[Chip Johannessen]] and [[Thomas J.

It later appeared in the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[Piper Maru]]".{{sfn|Gradnitzer|Pittson|1999|pp=32<U+2013>33}} The roadside diner used for interior shots of the "Flying Saucer Diner" was remote enough from the other filming locations that a bus was made available to transport crew members, to save on travel expenses. Only [[key grip]] Al Campbell did so, causing producers to abandon the idea until the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]] episode "[[Herrenvolk (The X-Files)|Herrenvolk]]".{{sfn|Gradnitzer|Pittson|1999|pp=31<U+2013>32}}

Guest star [[Seth Green]] stated that despite being cast as "stoner kid" Emil, and having "cornered the market on the affable stoner in TV and film", he had never used [[cannabis]] before.<ref name="randomrolesgreen"/> Green related that his first day on the set came just after Duchovny had finished filming his final scene; Green was impressed with Duchovny's demeanour and [[Improvisational theatre|improvisational]] acting, and has added that the two "just goofed off the whole time".<ref name="randomrolesgreen">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/seth-green,2034/ |title=Seth Green {{!}} Film {{!}} Random Roles |work=[[The A.V.

{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=The scene in which Scully is sitting at her computer writing in her journal [...] came down as an edict because [Fox] wanted a summing up of the episode, and in the end, I think it made the episode better.

Carter claimed that the scenes with the flashing lights in the sky were the "worst effects we've ever done", given limits on money and time; he also commented that [[special effect]]s were still in their infancy.<ref name="Commentary"/> Beck was the special effects producer and supervisor during season one; he and Carter unsuccessfully tried to make the special effects look three dimensional and "better". According to Carter, the result looked like a "kind of hi-tech ''[[Pong]]'' game".<ref name="Commentary"/>

This episode marks [[Mark Snow]]'s debut as a solo composer for the series. Carter stated he and the production crew were "fearful" of using too much music in the episode, and the first season as a whole. Anderson's voice over narration towards the end of the episode was inserted after complaints from Fox executives, who desired more closure. The executives felt that viewers were not supposed to be "confused" after watching and must have at least a slight idea of what was going on. The voiceovers became a common technique for the remainder of the series.<ref name="Commentary"/>

== Themes ==

Deep Throat's warning to Mulder that some truths should be kept hidden from the public has been cited by scholars as representing the difficulty of forcing large organizations to take responsibility for wrongdoing; Richard Flannery and David Louzecky, in ''The Philosophy of The X-Files'', compared Deep Throat's willingness to hide the truth of alien life to the cover-up of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and the trials following the [[Enron scandal]].<ref>[[#Kowalski|Kowalski]] 2007, pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref> The episode's final revelation, that aliens have been on Earth "for a long, long time", has been cited as following a trend of [[Post-Futurism|post-futurism]] established by science fiction cinema in the 1980s. This trend has replaced traditional science fiction topics such as space exploration with themes inspired by the Watergate scandal and the spread of conspiracy theories.{{sfn|Lavery|Hague|Cartwright|1996|p=149}}

In a first season retrospective in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the episode was rated a B+, with praise for Hardin's "world-weary" performance, though the review noted that the "querulous, ominous tone" of the episode was "a little awkward, but full of promise of things to come".<ref name="EW review">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295174,00.html |title=X Cyclopedia: The Ultimate Episode Guide, Season 1 {{!}} TV |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=November 29, 1996 |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> Adrienne Martini of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' called the episode "fun to watch", describing it as "great TV";<ref name="Austin">{{Cite web |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/1997-04-25/528027/ |title=Scanlines&nbsp;<U+2013> Screens&nbsp;<U+2013> The Austin Chronicle |first=Adrienne |last=Martini |work=[[Austin Chronicle]] |publisher=Austin Chronicle Corporation |date=April 25, 1997 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref> while the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' called the titular character "the most interesting new character on television", also calling the episode "strange but marvellous".<ref name="Mercury">{{cite news |title=The 'X-Files' Informant is Out There, Speaking on All Kinds of Levels |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB71C18C2422C7A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |publisher=[[MediaNews Group]] |date=November 19, 1993 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref> The ''[[Toronto Star]]''{{'s}} Mike Antonucci wrote that the episode demonstrates that Carter "can blend subtle, complicated elements with heart-pounding action", adding that "Nothing is obvious about ''The X-Files'', in fact, except its quality".<ref>{{cite news |title=The X-Files: Something Strange and Wonderful&nbsp;<U+2013> And they<U+2019>re here, right inside your television set |first=Mike |last=Antonucci |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |publisher=[[Star Media Group]] |date=November 30, 1993 |page=D4 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/519075281.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+30%2C+1993&author=&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=D.4&desc=The+X-Files%3A+something+strange+and+wonderful+And+they%27re+here%2C+right+inside+your+television+set |accessdate=June 24, 2012 }}</ref> Michael Janusonis of ''[[The Beaver County Times]]'' was more critical, calling it "an acquired taste" and noting that it "sort of diddled out in the end", lacking "a completely satisfactory resolution".<ref name="Beaver">{{cite news |title='X-Files' episodes offered on tape |first=Michael |last=Janusonis |newspaper=[[The Beaver County Times]] |publisher=[[Calkins Media]] |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JmAtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vdoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3901,3059271&dq=x+files+deep+throat&hl=en |date=April 14, 1996 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Keith Phipps rated the episode an A-, finding it "almost like an extension of the pilot".
