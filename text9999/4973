'''Microsoft Visual Studio Express''' is a set of [[freeware]] [[integrated development environment]]s developed by [[Microsoft]] that are lightweight versions of the [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Microsoft Visual Studio 2008]] (codenamed ''Orcas'') product line. The idea of express editions, according to Microsoft, is to provide a streamlined, easy-to-use and easy-to-learn IDEs for less serious users, such as hobbyists and students. The final versions were released on [[November 19]], [[2007]]. In line with popular demand since the Visual Studio 2005 Express Editions<ref name="ms-vse">{{cite web

}}</ref>, these editions will always remain free-of-charge. Visual Studio 2008 Express Editions require Windows XP or a later Windows version; Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 and Windows 9x are no longer supported. Visual Studio 2005 Express Editions can be installed on Windows 2000 SP4.

==Products==
Visual Studio Express consists of the following separate products:

* [[Visual Basic]] ([[Visual Basic .NET|.NET]]) 2008 [[Microsoft Visual Studio Express#Visual Basic Express|Express Edition]]
* [[Microsoft Visual C Sharp|Visual]] [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2008 Express Edition
* [[Visual C++]] 2008 [[Microsoft Visual Studio Express#Visual C.2B.2B 2008 Express Edition|Express Edition]]
* [[Microsoft Visual Studio Express#Visual Web Developer Express|Visual Web Developer]] 2008 Express Edition
* [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] 2008 [[SQL Server Express|Express Edition]] (to be released in the first half of 2008)

[[J Sharp|Microsoft Visual J# 2005]] was not updated for this release and is currently not planned. The version shipping with Visual Studio 2005 will be supported until 2015 as per the product life-cycle strategy.

===Visual Basic Express===
Despite the fact that it is a stripped-down version of Visual Studio, some improvements were made upon Visual Basic 2008 from Visual Basic 2005. Visual Basic 2008 Express includes the following improvements over Visual Basic 2005 Express:
<!-- ## NOTE: Information still needs updating. ## -->
* Includes the visual [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] designer codenamed "Cider"
* [[Debugging|Debugs]] at runtime
* Better [[IntelliSense]] support
**Fixes common spelling errors
**Corrects most invalid [[syntax]]
**Provides suggestions to [[Class (computer science)|class]] names when specified classes are not found

The Express Edition has the following limitations:<ref>{{web cite|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b4z62wxz(VS.80).aspx|title=Visual Basic Editions |publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>
* No IDE support for databases other than [[SQL Server Express]] and [[Microsoft Access]]
* No support for Web Applications with [[ASP.NET]] (this can instead be done with Visual Web Developer Express, though the non-Express version of Visual Basic allows both web and windows applications from the same IDE)
* No support for developing for mobile devices (no templates or emulator)
* No [[Crystal Reports]]
* Fewer project templates (e.g. Windows services template, Excel Workbook template)
* Limited options for [[debugging]] and [[breakpoint]]s.

===Visual Web Developer Express===
The Visual Web Developer Express is a freeware [[web development]] tool that allows developers to evaluate the web development and editing capabilities of the other Visual Studio 2008 editions at no charge. Its main function is to create [[ASP.NET]] websites.

It has a [[WYSIWYG]] interface, drag-and-drop user interface designer; enhanced [[HTML]] & code editors; a (limited) database explorer; support for other web technologies (e.g., [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[JavaScript]], [[XML]]); and integrated, design-time validation for standards including [[XHTML]] 1.0/1.1 and CSS 2.1. Visual Web Developer 2008 Express includes a new integrated HTML designer based on [[Microsoft Expression Web]].

Being an Express IDE, it lacks certain features, such as the Accessibility Checker, the ability to create standalone Class Library Projects (which can be done by the other language-specific Express Editions), the extensibility support necessary to load third-party add-ins and macros and some other features. <ref> [http://blogs.msdn.com/mikhailarkhipov/archive/2006/06/26/647516.aspx Which features are missing from Visual Web Developer Express: Mikhail Arkhipov's blog] </ref>

===Visual C++ Express ===
Due to the popularity of this freeware compiler, numerous popular programming libraries have been or are being modified to compile under this, including [[Irrlicht Engine|Irrlicht]] and Valve's [[Source engine]].{{fact|date=November 2007}}

The Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition can be used to compile [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] as well as [[Win32]] applications immediately after installation. However, natively compiling [[64-bit]] applications through the IDE is not supported. If the freely available [[Windows SDK]] is installed, 64-bit applications can be built on the command line using the x64 cross-compiler (Cl.exe) supplied with the SDK. <ref> [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9yb4317s.aspx How to: Configure Visual C++ Projects to Target 64-Bit Platforms] </ref>

Visual C++ 2008 Express does not include [[Microsoft Foundation Class Library|MFC]], [[Active Template Library|ATL]], [[OpenMP]] support, or 64-bit compilers, nor does it include a resource editor. The higher-end commercial editions of Visual Studio, specifically the Professional and Team Suite editions, have these features.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs24szh9(VS.90).aspx|title=Visual C++ Editions |publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

===Visual C# Express===
The list of breakpoints where the user could control the breakpoint features has been removed, so that now the user can only toggle breakpoints.

The following [[refactor]]ing modes were also removed:<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.msdner.com/dev-archive/0/35-24-2723.shtm|title=Technologies site about MSDN|publisher=MSDNER|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref>
* Encapsulate field
* Promote local to parameter
* Reorder parameters
* Remove parameters
* Extract interface 

This effectively reduces the refactoring capabilities of Visual C# Express to Renaming and Extracting Methods.

Developers state the reason of this removal as "to simplify the C# Express user experience". However this created a controversy as some end users claim it is an important feature, and instead of simplifying it cripples the user experience.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2004/10/20/245413.aspx|title=Aaron Stebner's WebLog|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=2004-10-20}}</ref>

The ability to attach the debugger to an already-running process has also been removed, hindering scenarios such as writing Windows services and re-attaching a debugger under ASP.NET when errors under the original debugging session cause breakpoints to be ignored.

===SQL Server Express===
{{main|SQL Server Express}}
SQL Server Express is a freeware, light-weight, and redistributable edition of [[Microsoft SQL Server|Microsoft SQL Server]]. It provides an integrated data storage solution for developers writing Windows applications and Web sites that have basic data storage needs. SQL Server Express replaces [[MSDE]] 2000 and significantly expands on its feature set.

The [[SQL]] Server Management Studio Express can also be downloaded to provide a graphical user interface for administering [[SQL Server]] Express.  

The Express Edition has the following limitations:<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/msde2sqlexpress.mspx|title=Upgrading MSDE 2000 to SQL Server Express|author=Microsoft Corporation|date=2006-04-07|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>
* Limited to one physical [[CPU]]
* Lack of enterprise features support
* One GB memory limit for the buffer pool
* Databases have a 4 GB maximum size<ref>{{web cite|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165672.aspx|title=Comparing SQL Server Express with MSDE|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref>
* No Data mirroring and/or clustering
* No profiler tool
* No workload throttle
* No UI to import/export data to table
