'''SS ''Empire Morn''''' was a 7,092 ton [[CAM ship]] which was built in 1941. She saw service on a number of trade routes during the [[Second World War]], making several crossings of the North Atlantic as well as voyages to Russia and Africa. She was badly damaged after hitting a [[naval mine|mine]] in 1943, and spent the rest of the war laid up as a hulk. She was subsequently sold and repaired, returning to service for several companies after the war, under the names '''''San Antonio''''' and '''''Rio Pas''''' before being sold for scrapping in 1973. She is also known for the death of the youngest person in the [[British Armed Forces|British services]] to die in the war, 14-year old galley boy [[Raymond Steed]].
