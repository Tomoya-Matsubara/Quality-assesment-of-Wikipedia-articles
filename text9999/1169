The '''cerebellum''' ([[Latin]]: "little brain") is a region of the [[brain]] that plays an important role in the integration of [[perception|sensory perception]] and [[motoneuron|motor]] output. Many [[neural pathway]]s link the cerebellum with the [[motor cortex]]<U+2014>which sends information to the [[muscle]]s causing them to move<U+2014>and the [[spinocerebellar tract]]<U+2014>which provides feedback on the position of the body in space ([[proprioception]]). The cerebellum integrates these pathways, using the constant feedback on body position to fine-tune motor movements.

Because of this 'updating' function of the cerebellum, [[lesion]]s within it are not so debilitating as to cause [[paralysis]], but rather present as feedback deficits resulting in disorders in fine movement, [[Equilibrioception|equilibrium]], [[Human position|posture]], and [[motor learning]]. Initial observations by [[physiology|physiologists]] during the 18th century indicated that patients with cerebellar damage show problems with motor coordination and movement. Research into cerebellar function during the early to mid 19th century was done via lesion and ablation studies in [[animal]]s. Research physiologists noted that such lesions led to animals with strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness. These observations and studies led to the conclusion that the cerebellum was a motor control structure.<ref name="Fine">{{cite journal | author=Fine EJ, Ionita CC, Lohr L | title=The history of the development of the cerebellar examination | journal=Semin Neurol | year=2002 | pages=375-84 | volume=22 | issue=4 | id=PMID 12539058}}</ref>  However, modern research shows that the cerebellum has a broader role in a number of key cognitive functions, including [[attention]] and the processing of [[language]], [[music]], and other sensory temporal stimuli. 

==General features==
The cerebellum is located in the inferior posterior portion of the head (the [[hindbrain]]), directly dorsal to the [[pons]], and inferior to the [[occipital lobe]] (Figs. 1 and 3). Because of its large number of tiny [[granule cell]]s, the cerebellum contains nearly 50% of all [[neuron]]s in the brain, although it constitutes only 10% of total brain volume. The cerebellum receives nearly 200 million input fibers; in contrast, the [[optic nerve]] is composed of a mere one million fibers.

The cerebellum is divided into two large [[hemisphere]]s, much like the [[telencephalon|cerebrum]], and contains ten smaller lobules. The [[cytoarchitectonics|cytoarchitecture]] ([[cell (biology)|cellular]] organization) of the cerebellum is highly uniform, with connections organized into a rough, [[dimension|three-dimensional]] [[array]] of perpendicular [[biological neural network|circuit]] elements. This organizational uniformity makes the nerve circuitry relatively easy to study. To envision this "perpendicular array", one might imagine a tree-lined street with wires running straight through the branches of one tree to the next.

==Development and evolution==
[[Image: CajalCerebellum.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Figure 2: Drawing of the [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[chicken]] cerebellum by [[Santiago Ram<U+00F3>n y Cajal|S. Ram<U+00F3>n y Cajal]].]]

During the early stages of [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]], the brain starts to form in three distinct segments: the [[prosencephalon]], [[mesencephalon]], and [[rhombencephalon]]. The rhombencephalon is the most caudal (toward the tail) segment of the embryonic brain; it is from this segment that the cerebellum develops. Along the embryonic rhombencephalic segment develop eight swellings, called [[rhombomere]]s. The cerebellum arises from two rhombomeres located in the [[alar plate]] of the [[neural tube]], a structure that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord. The specific rhombomeres from which the cerebellum forms are rhombomere 1 (Rh.1) caudally (near the tail) and the "isthmus" rostrally (near the front).<!--
  --><ref name="Muller">{{cite journal | author=Muller F, O'Rahilly R | title=The human brain at stages 21-23, with particular reference to the cerebral cortical plate and to the development of the cerebellum | journal=Anat Embryol (Berl) | year=1990 | pages=375-400 | volume=182 | issue=4 | id=PMID 2252222}}</ref>

The neural tube is organized so that the alar plate typically gives rise to structures involved in sensory functions; the basal (ventral, or lower) plate gives rise to motor functioning structures. Given its alar plate origins, the cerebellum would be expected to be devoted primarily to sensory functions. Despite its embryological origin, one of the many ironies of the cerebellum is that it functions primarily to modulate ''motor'' function.

Two primary regions are thought to give rise to the neurons that make up the cerebellum. The first region is the ventricular zone in the roof of the [[fourth ventricle]]. This area produces [[Purkinje cell]]s and deep cerebellar [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclear]] neurons. These cells are the primary output neurons of the cerebellar cortex and cerebellum. The second germinal zone (cellular birthplace) is known as the external granular layer. This layer of cells<U+2014>found on the exterior the cerebellum<U+2014>produces the granule neurons. Once born, the granule neurons migrate from this exterior layer to form an inner layer known as the internal granule layer. The external granular layer ceases to exist in the mature cerebellum, leaving only granule cells in the internal granule layer. The cerebellar [[white matter]] may be a third germinal zone in the cerebellum; however, its function as a germinal zone is controversial.

The cerebellum is of [[archipallium|archipalliar]] [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] origin. The [[pallium (anatomy)|pallium]] is a term for gray matter that forms the cortex. The archipallium is the one of the most [[evolution|evolutionarily]] primitive brain regions. The circuits in the cerebellar cortex look similar across all [[class (biology)|class]]es of [[vertebrate]]s, including [[fish]], [[reptiles]], [[birds]], and [[mammals]] (e.g., Fig. 2). This has been taken as evidence that the cerebellum performs functions important to all vertebrate [[species]].

==Anatomy==
The cerebellum contains similar [[gray matter|gray]] and white matter divisions as the [[cerebrum]]. Embedded within the white matter<U+2014>which is known as the ''[[arbor vitae]]'' ([[Tree of Life]]) in the cerebellum due to its branched, [[tree]]like appearance<U+2014>are four deep cerebellar nuclei. Three gross phylogenetic segments are largely grouped by general function. The three cortical layers contain various cellular types that often create various feedback and feedforward loops. [[Oxygen|Oxygenated]] [[blood]] is supplied by three [[artery|arterial]] branches off the [[basilar artery|basilar]] and [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]].

===Divisions===
[[Image:CerebellumRegions.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Cerebellum and surrounding regions; sagittal view of one hemisphere. A: [[Midbrain]]. B: [[Pons]]. C: [[Medulla oblongata|Medulla]]. D: [[Spinal cord]]. E: [[ventricular system|Fourth ventricle]]. F: [[Arbor vitae (anatomy)|''Arbor vitae'']]. G: Tonsil. H: Anterior lobe. I: Posterior lobe.]]
There are three phylogenetic divisions within the cerebellum: the flocculonodular, anterior, and posterior lobes (Fig. 3). These divisions are also called the archicerebellum, paleocerebellum, and neocerebellum, respectively, terms that more clearly reflect the method of dividing the lobes by their evolutionary age. The archicerebellum represents the oldest evolutionary cerebellar structure, and the neocerebellum represents the most recently evolved region. These divisions are divided from the front to the back of the cerebellum; starting with the flocculonodular lobe in the front, and ending with the posterior lobe in the back. The anterior and posterior lobes are separated by the primary fissure. The posterior and flocculonodular lobes are separated by the posterolateral fissure (Fig. 4).

The cerebellum can also be divided by function rather than evolutionary age. This results in three functional divisions that run perpendicular to the previously mentioned phylogenetic divisions. Rather than running from front to back, like the phylogenetic divisions, the functional regions align from the midline outwards toward the sides of the body. The midline division is called the medial zone, also known as the [[cerebellar vermis]] (<U+201C>[[worm]]<U+201D>) because of its long, slender shape; the vermis is further subdivided into smaller regions called lobules. The region just [[lateral]] (away from the center) of the vermis is called the intermediate zone; the most lateral, outer region is the lateral zone (Fig. 4).

Much of what is understood about the functions of the cerebellum stems from careful documentation of the effects of focal lesions in human patients who have suffered from injury or disease or through animal lesion research.

====Cerebellar structure and function from a phylogenetic perspective====
=====Archicerebellum (or Vestibulocerebellum)=====
The archicerebellum is associated with the flocculonodular lobe and is mainly involved in balance ([[vestibular system]]) and [[eye]] movement functions. It receives input from the inferior and medial vestibular nuclei and sends fibers back to the vestibular nuclei, creating a feedback loop that allows for the constant maintenance of balance.

=====Paleocerebellum (or Spinocerebellum)=====
The paleocerebellum controls proprioception related to [[muscle tone]] (constant, partial muscle contraction that is important for the maintenance of [[posture]]). The paleocerebellum receives its inputs from the dorsal and ventral [[spinocerebellar tract]]s, which carry information about the position and forces acting on the legs. The paleocerebellum then sends axonal projections to the deep cerebellar nuclei.

=====Neocerebellum (or Cerebrocerebellum)=====
The neocerebellum receives input from the pontocerebellar tract and projects to the deep cerebellar nuclei. The pontocerebellar tract originates at the [[pontine nuclei]], which receive their input from the cerebral motor cortex. Thus, the neocerebellum is associated with motor control, in particular, the coordination of fine finger movements such as those required by typing. Whereas the other parts of the cerebellum function in the manner of feedback correction of motor activity, the neocerebellum is ideally arranged to work also in a feed-forward manner. It operates in conjunction with the cortical motor centres to plan movement which is just about to occur, presumably drawing on motor memory either within itself or within the cerebral cortex<ref> Kingsley RE. 2000. Consise Text of Neuroscience. second edition. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. ISBN 0-683-30460-7.  </ref>.

====The functional organization of the cerebellum====
[[Image:CerebellumDiv.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure 4: Schematic representation of the major anatomical subdivisions of the cerebellum. Superior view of an "unrolled" cerebellum, placing the vermis in one plane.]]

=====Vermis=====
The vermis receives its inputs mainly from the spinocerebellar tracts from the trunk of the body. These tracts carry to the vermis information on the position and balance of the torso. The vermis sends projections to the fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum, which then sends output to the vestibular nuclei. The vestibular nuclei are structures important for the maintenance of balance.

=====Intermediate zone=====
The intermediate zone (or paravermis) receives input from the corticopontocerebellar fibers that originate from the [[motor cortex]]. These fibers carry a duplicate of the information that was sent from the motor cortex to the spine in order to effect a movement. The intermediate zone also receives sensory feedback from the muscles. These two streams of information are integrated by this region, allowing for the feedback comparison of what the muscles are supposed to be doing with what they are actually doing.

=====Lateral zone=====
The lateral zone receives input from the [[parietal lobe|parietal cortex]] via pontocerebellar mossy fibers regarding the location of the body in the world. The large numbers of feedback circuits allow for the integration of this body position information with indications of muscle position, strength, and speed.

===Deep nuclei===
The four deep cerebellar nuclei are in the center of the cerebellum, embedded in the white matter. These nuclei receive [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]] ([[GABA]]ergic) inputs from Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] ([[glutamate]]rgic) inputs from [[mossy fiber]] pathways. Most output fibers of the cerebellum originate from these nuclei. One exception is that fibers from the flocculonodular lobe synapse directly on [[vestibular nuclei]] without first passing through the deep cerebellar nuclei. The vestibular nuclei in the [[brainstem]] are analogous structures to the deep nuclei, since they receive both mossy fiber and Purkinje cell inputs.

From lateral to medial, the four deep cerebellar nuclei are the dentate, emboliform, globose, and fastigial. An easy [[mnemonic]] device to remember these names and positions relative to their position from the midline is the phrase "'''D'''on't '''E'''at '''G'''reasy '''F'''ood", where each letter indicates the lateral to medial location in the cerebellar white matter. Some animals do not have distinct emboliform and globose nuclei, instead having a single, fused nucleus interpositus (interposed nucleus). In animals with distinct emboliform and globose nuclei, the term ''interposed nucleus'' is often used to refer collectively to these two nuclei. 

In general, each pair of deep nuclei is associated with a corresponding region of cerebellar surface anatomy. The dentate nuclei are deep within the lateral hemispheres, the interposed nuclei are located in the paravermal (intermediate) zone, and the fastigial nuclei are in the vermis. These structural relationships are generally maintained in the neuronal connections between the nuclei and associated cerebellar cortex, with the dentate nucleus receiving most of its connections from the lateral hemispheres, the interposed nuclei receiving inputs mostly from the paravermis, and the fastigial nucleus receiving primarily afferents from the vermis.

===Cortical layers===

[[Image: L7cerebellum.png|thumb|300px|right|Figure 6: [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|Confocal]] [[micrograph]] from [[mouse]] cerebellum expressing green-fluorescent protein in [[Purkinje cells]].]]

There are three layers to the cerebellar cortex; from outer to inner layer, these are the molecular, Purkinje, and granular layers. The function of the cerebellar cortex is essentially to modulate information flowing through the deep nuclei. The microcircuitry of the cerebellum is schematized in Figure 5. [[Mossy fiber|Mossy]] and [[climbing fiber]]s carry sensorimotor information into the deep nuclei, which in turn pass it on to various premotor areas, thus regulating the [[Gain#Electronics|gain]] and timing of motor actions. Mossy and climbing fibers also feed this information into the cerebellar cortex, which performs various computations, resulting in the regulation of Purkinje cell firing. Purkinje neurons feed back into the deep nuclei via a potent inhibitory [[synapse]]. This synapse regulates the extent to which mossy and climbing fibers activate the deep nuclei, and thus control the ultimate effect of the cerebellum on motor function. The synaptic strength of almost every synapse in the cerebellar cortex has been shown to undergo [[synaptic plasticity]]. This allows the circuitry of the cerebellar cortex to continuously adjust and fine-tune the output of the cerebellum, forming the basis of some types of motor learning and coordination. Each layer in the cerebellar cortex contains the various cell types that comprise this circuitry.

====Granular layer====
The innermost layer contains the cell bodies of two types of cells: the numerous and tiny [[granule cell]]s, and the larger [[Golgi cell]]s. Mossy fibers enter the granular layer from their main point of origin, the pontine nuclei. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. The granule cells send their T-shaped axons<U+2014>known as [[parallel fiber]]s<U+2014>up into the superficial molecular layer, where they form hundreds of thousands of synapses with Purkinje cell [[dendrite]]s. The human cerebellum contains on the order of 60 to 80 billion granule cells, making this single cell type by far the most numerous neuron in the brain (roughly 70% of all neurons in the brain and spinal cord, combined).  Golgi cells provide inhibitory feedback to granule cells, forming a synapse with them and projecting an axon into the molecular layer.

====Purkinje layer====
The middle layer contains only one type of cell body<U+2014>that of the large [[Purkinje cell]].  Purkinje cells are the primary integrative neurons of the cerebellar cortex and provide its sole output. Purkinje cell dendrites are large arbors with hundreds of spiny branches reaching up into the molecular layer (Fig. 6). These dendritic arbors are flat<U+2014>nearly all of them lie in planes<U+2014>with neighboring Purkinje arbors in parallel planes. Each parallel fiber from the granule cells runs [[orthogonality|orthogonally]] through these arbors, like a wire passing through many layers. Purkinje neurons are GABAergic<U+2014>meaning they have inhibitory synapses<U+2014>with the neurons of the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. Each Purkinje cell receives excitatory input from 100,000 to 200,000 parallel fibers. Parallel fibers are said to be responsible for the simple (all or nothing, [[amplitude]] invariant) spiking of the Purkinje cell.

Purkinje cells also receive input from the [[inferior olivary nucleus]] via [[climbing fiber]]s. A good mnemonic for this interaction is the phrase "climb the olive tree", given that climbing fibers originate from the inferior olive. Each Purkinje cell receives input from a single climbing fiber in the form of a powerful excitatory signal. These [[action potential]]s are of a rare class in that the excitatory postsynaptic response from climbing fibers are amplitude variant. These responses are known as complex spikes.

====Molecular layer====
This outermost layer of the cerebellar cortex contains two types of inhibitory [[interneuron]]s: the [[stellate cell|stellate]] and [[basket cell]]s. It also contains the dendritic arbors of Purkinje neurons and parallel fiber tracts from the granule cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.

===Peduncles===
Similarly, the cerebellum follows the trend of "threes", with three major input and output peduncles (fiber bundles). These are the superior (brachium conjunctivum), middle (brachium pontis), and inferior (restiform body) cerebellar peduncles. There are three sources of input to the cerebellum, in two categories consisting of mossy and climbing fibers, respectively. Mossy fibers can originate from the pontine nuclei, which are clusters of neurons located in the pons that carry information from the contralateral cerebral cortex. They may also arise within the spinocerebellar tract whose origin is located in the [[Anatomical position|ipsilateral]] [[spinal cord]]. Most of the output from the cerebellum initially synapses onto the deep cerebellar nuclei before exiting via the three peduncles. The most notable exception is the direct inhibition of the vestibular nuclei by Purkinje cells.

====Superior cerebellar peduncle====
While there are some afferent fibers from the anterior spinocerebellar tract that are conveyed to the anterior cerebellar lobe via this peduncle, most of the fibers are efferents. Thus, the superior cerebellar peduncle is the major output pathway of the cerebellum. Most of the efferent fibers originate within the dentate nucleus which in turn project to various [[midbrain]] structures including the [[red nucleus]], the ventral lateral/ventral anterior nucleus of the [[thalamus]], and the [[medulla]]. The dentatorubrothalamocortical (dentate nucleus > red nucleus > thalamus > premotor cortex) and cerebellothalamocortical (cerebellum > thalamus > premotor cortex) pathways are two major pathways that pass through this peduncle and are important in motor planning.

====Middle cerebellar peduncle====
This is composed entirely of afferent fibers originating within the pontine nuclei as part of the massive corticopontocerebellar (cerebral cortex > pons > cerbellum) tract. These fibers descend from the sensory and motor areas of the cerebral [[neopallium|neocortex]] and make the middle cerebellar peduncle the largest of the three cerebellar peduncles.

====Inferior cerebellar peduncle====
{{main|Inferior cerebellar peduncle}}
This carries many types of input and output fibers that are mainly concerned with integrating [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] sensory input with motor [[Vestibular system|vestibular functions]] such as balance and posture maintenance. Proprioceptive information from the body is carried to the cerebellum via the dorsal [[spinocerebellar tract]]. This tract passes through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and synapses within the paleocerebellum. Vestibular information projects onto the archicerebellum. 

The [[climbing fiber]]s of the [[Inferior olivary nucleus|inferior olive]]  run through the inferior cerebellar peduncle.

This peduncle also carries information directly from the Purkinje cells out to the [[vestibular nuclei]] in the dorsal brainstem located at the junction between the [[pons]] and [[medulla]].

===Blood supply===
[[Image:CerebellumArteries.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Figure 7: The three major arteries of the cerebellum: the SCA, AICA, and PICA.]]
Three arteries supply blood to the cerebellum (Fig. 7): the [[superior cerebellar artery]] (SCA), [[anterior inferior cerebellar artery]] (AICA), and [[posterior inferior cerebellar artery]] (PICA).

====Superior cerebellar artery====
The SCA branches off the lateral portion of the basilar artery, just inferior to its bifurcation into the posterior cerebral artery. Here it wraps posteriorly around the pons (to which it also supplies blood) before reaching the cerebellum. The SCA supplies blood to most of the cerebellar cortex, the cerebellar nuclei, and the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles.

====Anterior inferior cerebellar artery====
The AICA branches off the lateral portion of the basilar artery, just superior to the junction of the vertebral arteries. From its origin, it branches along the inferior portion of the pons at the cerebellopontine angle before reaching the cerebellum. This artery supplies blood to the anterior portion of the inferior cerebellum, and to the [[facial nerve|facial]] (CN VII) and [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]s (CN VIII).

Obstruction of the AICA can cause [[paresis]], [[paralysis]], and loss of sensation in the face; it can also cause [[hearing impairment]].

====Posterior inferior cerebellar artery====
The PICA branches off the lateral portion of the vertebral arteries just inferior to their junction with the basilar artery. Before reaching the inferior surface of the cerebellum, the PICA sends branches into the medulla, supplying blood to several [[cranial nerve]] nuclei. In the cerebellum, the PICA supplies blood to the posterior inferior portion of the cerebellum, the inferior cerebellar peduncle, the [[nucleus ambiguus]], the [[vagus nerve|vagus]] motor nucleus, the spinal [[trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] nucleus, the [[solitary nucleus]], and the [[vestibulocochlear nerve|vestibulocochlear]] nuclei.

==Dysfunction==
Patients with cerebellar dysfunction experience problems in walking, balance, and accurate hand and arm movement. Recent brain imaging studies using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) show that the cerebellum is important for [[language processing]] and [[selective attention]]. [[Mental illness|Neuropsychiatric disorders]] such as [[dyslexia]], [[schizophrenia]] and [[autism]] appear to be associated with a deficiency in the cerebellum, which may also play a role in the development of certain [[ataxia]]s, including a form of [[cerebral palsy]]. [[Spinocerebellar ataxia]] patients suffer cerebellar degeneration.   It is believed that [[opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome]] is caused by an autoimmune attack on the cerebellum among other brain regions.

===Lesions of the cerebellum===
Patients with cerebellar [[lesion]]s (injuries) typically exhibit deficits during movement execution. For example, they show "intention tremors"<U+2014>a tremor occurring during movement rather than at rest, as seen in [[Parkinson's disease]]. Patients may also show [[dysmetria]], i.e., an overestimation or underestimation of force, resulting in overshoot or undershoot when reaching for a target. Another common sign of cerebellar damage is an inability to perform rapid alternating movements.

The anterior and medial aspects of the cerebellum represent information ipsilaterally; thus, damage to this region on one side affects the movement on the same side of the body. The posterior and lateral aspects of the cerebellum represent information bilaterally; damage to this region has been shown to impair sensory<U+2013>motor adaptation, while leaving motor control unaffected. In certain instances, a patient experiences a focal lesion. Such localized lesions cause a wide variety of symptoms related to their location in the cerebellum. A striking example is archicerebellar lesions, which cause motor symptoms not unlike those seen during [[intoxication]]: uncoordinated movements, swaying, unstable walking, and a wide gait. To avoid suspicion by the police of public drunkenness, American patients who suffer archicerebellar lesions carry [[identification card]]s written by their physicians, indicating their medical condition.

A lesion to the paleocerebellum causes severe disturbance in muscle tone and bodily posture, resulting in weakness to the side of the body opposite the lesion. A neocerebellar lesion is associated with deficits in skilled voluntary movement, such as playing the piano. A lesion to the intermediate zone causes problems with fine-tuning and corrective movements. Patients with this type of lesion who hold their fingers in front of them have great difficulty in moving those fingers together. Patients with a lesion to the lateral zone have difficulty in controlling fine muscle movements and exhibit symptoms similar to those of patients with an intermediate zone lesion.

Patients with a cerebellar lesion may have [[nystagmus]] with the fast stroke pointing towards the side of the lesion.

[[Alcohol abuse]] is also a common cause of cerebellar lesions. Alcohol abuse can lead to [[thiamine]] deficiency, which in the cerebellum will cause degeneration of the anterior lobe. This degeneration leads to a wide, staggering gait but does not affect arm movement or speech.<!--

===Ischemia and thrombosis===
An obstruction of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (known as 'PICA syndrome') can cause a wide range of characteristic effects. An obstruction of the artery causes [[necrosis|cell death]] as the cells are deprived of [[oxygen]] and nutrients provided by the blood. PICA syndrome manifests as a loss of sensation in the contralateral limbs due to damage of the inferior cerebellar peduncle as well as dizziness and nausea due to loss of blood to the nucleus ambiguus and vestibulocochlear nuclei.

==Theories about cerebellar function==
Three main theories address the function of the cerebellum. One claims that the cerebellum functions as a regulator of the "timing of movements". This has emerged from studies of patients whose timed movements are disrupted.<!--

The second theory claims that the cerebellum operates as a learning machine, encoding information as does a computer. This was first proposed by [[David Marr|Marr]] and Albus in the early 1970s.<!--

The third, "Tensor Network Theory" provides a mathematical model of transformation of sensory (covariant) space-time coordinates into motor (contravariant) coordinates by cerebellar neuronal networks.<!--

Like many controversies in the physical sciences, there is evidence supporting each of the above hypotheses. Studies of motor learning in the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] and [[eyeblink conditioning]] demonstrate that the timing and [[amplitude]] of learned movements are encoded by the cerebellum.<!--

Many [[synaptic plasticity]] mechanisms have been found throughout the cerebellum. The Marr-Albus model mostly attributes motor learning to a single plasticity mechanism: the [[long-term depression]] of parallel fiber synapses. The Tensor Network Theory of sensorimotor transformations by the cerebellum has also been experimentally supported.<!--

numerous diverse functions are now at least partially attributed to the cerebellum. What was once thought to be primarily a motor/sensory integration region is now proving to be involved in many diverse cognitive functions. Paradoxically, despite the importance of this region and the heterogeneous role it plays in motor and sensory functions, people who have lost their entire cerebellum through disease, injury, or surgery can live reasonably normal lives.

==Cerebellar modeling==
As mentioned in the preceding section, there have been many attempts to [[Mathematical model|model]] the cerebellar function.<!--
