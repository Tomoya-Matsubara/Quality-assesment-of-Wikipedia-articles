'''Children of the Stars''' is a 2007 documentary about children with [[autism]] ({{zh|c=<U+5B64><U+72EC><U+75C7>|p=G<U+016B>d<U+00FA>zh<U+00E8>ng|l=Autism}}) in the [[People's Republic of China]]. It was produced by [[Alexander Haase]] and  directed by [[Rob Aspey]]. The title is an English translation of the expression {{nowrap|"<U+661F><U+661F><U+7684><U+5B69><U+5B50>"}} ({{zh|p=X<U+012B>ngx<U+012B>ng -de h<U+00E1>izi|l=star children; children of the stars|links=no}}), a phrase used in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] to describe autistic children.<ref name="AboutUs">Beijing Stars and Rain ().

The documentary focuses on the Beijing Stars and Rain Teaching Institute (<U+5317><U+4EAC><U+661F><U+661F><U+96E8><U+6559><U+80B2><U+7814><U+7A76><U+6240>), founded in 1993 by Tian Huiping. In 1992 Tian traveled  from [[Chongqing]], [[Sichuan]] to [[Beijing]]<U+2014>a distance of 1460&nbsp;km, or 907&nbsp;miles<U+2014>looking for help for her own autistic son but found nothing.<ref name="ToCatch">Jocelyn, Ed & Wu, Runmei.

Funded solely through charitable donations, the Beijing Stars and Rain School was the first [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental educational organization]] in China dedicated to serving children with autism.<ref name="field">Field, Brian (2010).

The documentary follows the progress of five-year-old Feng Jia Wei and his father and mother, Feng Lei and Hao Yue Chun, who traveled across China to enroll their son in the school. The parents faced hardship in their community<U+2014>a complete lack of schools or facilities to deal with autistic children, no network of governmental aid or funds, ostracism from neighbors, and loss of their jobs.<ref name="synopsis">[http://www.childrenofthestars-film.org/film.html  The Film:Long Synopsis].

Accessed 9 September 2010.</ref> Public health services for autistic children in China are almost nonexistent, as Tian Huiping explains:
<blockquote>Parents of autistic children can't expect any help from society. It's not just a question of financial help; they cannot get specialized help either... More [than] 98 percent of autistic children have to stay at home because they are rejected by kindergartens even if they are very high-functional &ndash; autistic children have very poor social skills. Attending school is a dream.<ref name="ToCatch">Jocelyn, Ed & Wu, Runmei. (2009). [http://www.cbw.com/btm/issue69/28-31.html To Catch a Falling Star]. China Business World.

At the time of their arrival, Jia Wei is violent and uncooperative. He cannot speak, and shows little recognition of his parents, whom he frequently bites and hits:<ref name="synopsis" />
<blockquote>Families had been waiting for 2 years to attend and often arrived in a state of despair. They could not communicate with their children or understand the symptoms of autism at all. They were looking for a cure and thought that this school was where miracles happened.<ref name="director">Asprey, Rob. (2009). [http://gosprout.org/film/sff2009/children.html Director's statement]. Website of the [[Sprout Film Festival]]. Accessed 9 September 2010.</ref>

The program requires weeks of tireless work. As producer  Alender Haase describes the early days watching Jia Wei's family struggle: "Sometimes I said to myself: 'Well, that's enough; I can't stand it anymore'. We wanted to drop the camera and leave. The parents seemed to be on the edge of mental collapse. But the strong power of love and patience pulled them back, and so it did to us." <ref name="press">Qi, Lin. (2007).  [http://www.childrenofthestars-film.org/press.html Helping small stars shine]. Accessed 9 September 2010.</ref> In time, Jia Wei's family begins to see a number of break-through experiences, and their first opportunity to live in a nurturing setting offers them hope. However, they are apprehensive about returning to their unfriendly home town, and fear that Jia Wei's obvious progress will not be enough to let him enter a public school.<ref name="synopsis" />

''Children of the Stars'' is described as a "riveting documentary" on ''[[Library Journal]]'''s website: 
<blockquote>[Feng Jia Wei's] parents candidly share their difficulty in a society that doesn't understand autism. Their desperation is evident as they coax and cajole Jia Wei through school activities intended to help him to communicate. Then we witness the moment when Jia Wei calls out "daddy" for the first time. These connections with the parents make this heartwarming movie wonderful to watch."<ref name="LibJ">Library Journal.
