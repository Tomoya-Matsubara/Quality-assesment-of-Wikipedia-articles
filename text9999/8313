The '''Republican Party''' is one of the [[Two-party system|two]] [[Major party|major]] contemporary [[political parties in the United States]], along with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Founded by anti-slavery expansion activists in 1854, it is often called the '''Grand Old Party''' ('''GOP'''). The [[Party platform|party's platform]] generally reflects [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] in the [[Politics of the United States|U.S. political spectrum]] and is considered [[centre-right|center-right]], in contrast to the more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal-leaning]] Democrats.

The Republican Party has the [[Political party strength in U.S. states|second most registered voters]] as of 2004 with 55 million, encompassing roughly one-third of the electorate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/in-the-us-have-there-been-more-democrat-or-republican-presidents.htm |title=In the US, Have There Been More Democrat or Republican Presidents? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> In the [[112th Congress]], elected in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010]], the Republican Party holds a majority of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and a minority of seats in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The party holds the majority of [[Governor (United States)|governorships]], as well as the majority of [[List of U.S. state legislatures|state legislatures]], and control of one chamber in five states.

==History==
{{Main|History of the United States Republican Party}}
[[File:Republicanlogo.svg|thumb|right|The traditional [[elephant]] logo is a well-known symbol of the Republican Party.]]
Founded in northern states in 1854 by [[Slave Power|anti-slavery]] activists, modernizers, [[Whig Party (United States)|ex-Whigs]] and ex-[[Free Soil]]ers, the Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. It first came to power in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to the Presidency and Republicans in control of Congress and the northern states. It oversaw the saving of the union, the destruction of slavery, and the provision of equal rights to all men in the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], 1861-1877.<ref>Gould, ''Grand Old Party''</ref>

[[File:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|220px|left|upright|[[Abraham Lincoln]], the first Republican President (1861<U+2013>1865).]]

The first official party convention was held on July 6, 1854 in [[Jackson, Michigan]]. The Republicans' initial base was in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the upper [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. With the [[Realigning election|realignment]] of parties and voters in the [[Third Party System]], the strong run of [[John C. Fremont]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856 Presidential election]] demonstrated it dominated most northern states. Early Republican ideology was reflected in the 1856 slogan "free labor, free land, free men."<ref>William Gienapp, ''The Origins of the Republican Party'' (1989) p.168</ref> "Free labor" referred to the Republican opposition to slave labor and belief in independent artisans and businessmen. "Free land" referred to Republican opposition to plantation system whereby the rich could buy up all the good farm land and work it with slaves, leaving the [[yeoman]] independent farmers the leftovers. The Party had the goal of containing the expansion of slavery, which would cause the collapse of the [[Slave Power]] and the expansion of freedom.<ref>Foner, ''Free soil, free labor, free men'' (1970)</ref> Lincoln, representing the fast-growing western states, won the Republican nomination in 1860 and subsequently won the presidency. The party took on the mission of saving the Union and destroying slavery during the [[American Civil War]] and over [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1864|election of 1864]], it united with pro-war Democrats to nominate Lincoln on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] ticket.
{{Politics of the United States}}
The party's success created factionalism within the party in the 1870s. Those who felt that Reconstruction had been accomplished and was continued mostly to promote the large-scale corruption tolerated by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ran [[Horace Greeley]] for the presidency. The Stalwarts defended Grant and the [[spoils system]]; the [[Half-Breed (politics)|Half-Breeds]] pushed for reform of the [[civil service]]. The GOP supported business generally, hard money (i.e., the [[gold standard]]), [[Tariffs in American history|high tariffs to promote economic growth, high wages and high profits]], generous pensions for Union veterans, and (after 1893) the annexation of [[Hawaii]]. The Republicans supported the pietistic Protestants who demanded [[Prohibition]]. As the Northern post-bellum economy boomed with heavy and light industry, railroads, mines, fast-growing cities and prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth. Nevertheless, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself.

[[File:President Theodore Roosevelt, 1904.jpg|thumb|220px|left|upright|[[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|26th]] President of the United States (1901<U+2013>1909).]]

After the two terms of Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]], the election of [[William McKinley]] in [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896]] is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is sometimes cited as a [[realigning election]]. McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the [[Panic of 1893]], and that the GOP would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit. The Republicans were cemented as the party of business, though mitigated by the succession of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] who embraced [[trust busting]]. He later ran on a third party ticket of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] and challenged his previous successor [[William Howard Taft]]. The party controlled the presidency throughout the 1920s, running on a platform of opposition to the [[League of Nations]], high tariffs, and promotion of business interests. [[Warren G. Harding]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover]] were resoundingly elected in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]], and [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] respectively. The [[Teapot Dome scandal]] threatened to hurt the party but Harding died and Coolidge blamed everything on him, as the opposition splintered in 1924. The pro-business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity until the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] heralded the [[Great Depression]].

[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower, official photo portrait, May 29, 1959.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Dwight Eisenhower]], 34th President of the United States (1953-1961).]]

The [[New Deal coalition]] of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. [[African American]]s moved into the Democratic Party during Roosevelt's time. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress at lightning speed. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving them with only 25 against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives was split in a similar ratio. Republicans in Congress heavily criticized the "Second New Deal" and likened it to [[class conflict|class warfare]] and [[socialism]]. The volume of legislation, and the inability of the Republicans to block it, soon elevated the level of opposition to Roosevelt. Conservative Democrats, mostly from the South, joined with Republicans led by Senator [[Robert Taft]] to create the [[conservative coalition]], which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964. The Republicans recaptured Congress in 1946 after gaining 13 seats in the Senate and 55 seats in the House.

[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Ronald Reagan]], 40th President of the United States (1981<U+2013>1989).]]

The second half of the 20th century saw election or succession of Republican presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]]. The Republican Party, led by House Republican Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]] campaigning on a ''[[Contract with America]]'', was elected to majorities to both houses of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994. The Senate majority lasted until 2001, when the Senate became split evenly but was regained in the 2002 elections. Both Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained control in the mid-term elections of 2006. In the 21st century, the Republican Party has been defined by [[social conservatism]], a [[preemptive war]] foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global democracy, a more powerful [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], [[supply-side economics]], support for gun ownership, and deregulation.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|Presidential election of 2008]], the party's nominees were Senator [[John McCain]], of Arizona, for President and Alaska Governor [[Sarah Palin]] for Vice President. They were defeated by Senator [[Barack Obama]] of Illinois.  In 2009, Republicans [[Chris Christie]] and [[Bob McDonnell]] were elected to the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia and in 2010, Republican [[Scott Brown]] won the Massachusetts special Senate election. Their victories were harbingers of a GOP landslide in fall 2010, retaking control of the House and gaining a majority of state governor seats.  Overall 2010 was a historic election for the Republican party. The Republicans gained 680 seats, the biggest gain by either party since 1966, which surpassed Democratic gains in the election of 1974. Republicans now hold approximately 3,890 of the total state legislative seats in America, about 53 percent. That is the most seats in the GOP column since 1928. The Republicans will now control at least 54 of the 99 state legislative chambers, the highest number since 1952.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ed Smith |url=http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=21634 |title=Republicans Exceed Expectations in 2010 State Legislative Elections |publisher=Ncsl.org |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>

Retrieved on 2008-09-01.</ref>]]
The party's founding members chose the name "Republican Party" in the mid-1850s as homage to the values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] promoted by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s Republican party.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rutland, Robert Allen | title=The Republicans: From Lincoln to Bush | year=1996 | page=2}}</ref> The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party's leading publicist [[Horace Greeley]], who called for, "some simple name like 'Republican' [that] would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery."<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/origins.htm The Origins of the Republican Party]"</ref>  The name reflects the 1776 [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption.<ref>{{cite book | author=Gould, Lewis | title=Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans | year=2003| pages=14<U+2013>15}}</ref>

The term "Grand Old Party" is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party, and the initialism "G.O.P." (or "GOP") is a commonly used designation.<ref>  The first reference to the Republican Party as the "grand old party" is dated to 1876; the first use of the abbreviation "GOP" is dated 1884. See "Grand Old Party," ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>

The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant. A political cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]], published in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly]]'' on November 7, 1874, is considered the first important use of the symbol.<ref>[http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Year=2003&Month=November&Date=7 Cartoon of the Day: "The Third-Term Panic"]. Retrieved on 2007-02-21.</ref> In the early 20th century, the usual symbol of the Republican Party in Midwestern states such as [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]] was the [[eagle]], as opposed to the Democratic [[rooster]].

After the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], the color red became associated with the GOP, although the party has not officially adopted it. That election night, for the first time, all of the major broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: states won by Republican nominee [[George W. Bush]] were colored red, and states won by Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]] were colored blue. Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal, they have come to be widely recognized by the media to represent the respective political parties ''(see [[Political color]] and [[Red states and blue states]] for more details)''.

==Structure and composition==
{{further|[[Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties]]}}
The [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC) is responsible for promoting Republican campaign activities. It is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform, as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy. Its current chairman is the first African American elected to the post, [[Michael S. Steele]]. The chairman of the RNC is chosen by the President when the Republicans have the White House or otherwise by the Party's state committees. The RNC, under the direction of the party's presidential candidate, supervises the [[Republican National Convention]], raises funds, and coordinates campaign strategy. On the local level, there are similar state committees in every state and most large cities, counties and legislative districts, but they have far less money and influence than the national body.

The Republican House and Senate caucuses have separate [[fundraising]] and strategy committees. The [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] (NRCC) assists in House races, and the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] (NRSC) in Senate races. They each raise over $100 million per election cycle, and play important roles in recruiting strong state candidates, while the [[Republican Governors Association]] (RGA) assists in state gubernatorial races; it is currently chaired by Governor [[Haley Barbour]] of Mississippi.

==Ideology and political positions==
{{Further|[[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)]]}}

The Republican Party includes [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]], [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]], [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]], [[moderate]]s, and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]]. Prior to the formation of the [[conservative coalition]], which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the party historically advocated [[classical liberalism]], [[paleoconservatism]], and [[American progressivism|progressivism]].

===Economic policies===
Republicans emphasize the role of [[free market]]s and individual achievement as the primary factors behind economic prosperity. To this end, they favor [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and the promotion of [[Responsibility assumption|personal responsibility over welfare programs]].

A leading economic theory advocated by modern Republicans is [[supply-side economics]]. Some fiscal policies influenced by this theory were popularly known as [[Reaganomics]], a term popularized during the Presidential administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]]. This theory holds that reduced income tax rates increase [[GDP]] growth and thereby generate the same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the extra growth. This belief is reflected, in part, by the party's long-term advocacy of tax cuts. Many Republicans consider the income tax system to be inherently inefficient and oppose graduated tax rates, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth. They believe private spending is usually more efficient than government spending. Republicans oppose the [[estate tax]].

Most Republicans agree there should be a "safety net" to assist the less fortunate; however, they tend to believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor than government is; as a result, Republicans support giving government grants to faith-based and other private charitable organizations to supplant welfare spending. Members of the GOP also believe that limits on eligibility and benefits must be in place to ensure the safety net is not abused. Republicans introduced and strongly supported the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform of 1996]], which was signed into law by Democratic President Clinton, and which limited eligibility for welfare, successfully leading to many former welfare recipients finding jobs.<ref>{{wayback |title=Welfare Reforms Reduce Poverty |publisher=House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources |date=2006-04-28 |url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/welfare/042806welfarereport.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5oAXfUewC |archivedate=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{wayback |title=Welfare Reforms Reduce Welfare Dependence |publisher=House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources |date=2006-02-26 |url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/welfare/022706welfare.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5oAXfUcct |archivedate=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>

The party opposes a government-run [[single-payer health care]] system, believing such a system constitutes [[socialized medicine]] and is in favor of a personal or employer-based system of insurance, supplemented by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for the elderly and [[Medicaid]], which covers approximately 40% of the poor.<ref>[http://www2.citizen.org/hrg/medicaid/assets/reports/2007UnsettlingScores.pdf Unsettling Scores: A Ranking of State Medicaid Programs, P. 15]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> The GOP has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] programs.

Many Republicans support increased health insurance portability, laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of a streamlined [[electronic medical records]] system, an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. They generally oppose government funding for elective abortions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Bobby_Jindal.htm |title=Bobby Jindal on the Issues |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>

Republicans are generally opposed by [[trade union|labor union]] management and members, and have supported various legislation on the state and federal levels, including [[right to work]] legislation and the [[Taft-Hartley Act]], which gives workers the right not to participate in unions, as opposed to a [[closed shop]], which prohibits workers from choosing not to join unions in workplaces. Some Republicans are opposed to increases in the [[minimum wage]], believing that such increases hurt many businesses by forcing them to cut jobs and services, export jobs overseas, and raise the prices of goods to compensate for the decrease in profit.

===Separation of powers and balance of powers===

[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Bill of Rights]].]]

Many contemporary Republicans voice support of [[strict constructionism]], the judicial philosophy that the Constitution should be interpreted narrowly and as close to the original intent as is practicable rather than a more flexible "living Constitution" model.<ref>[http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/issues/judges.html On the Issues: Supreme Court]<!--It's only McCain's position, so a better ref would be good, but any comparison of the 2008 Republican candidates should show them all agreeing.--></ref> Most Republicans point to [[Roe v. Wade]] as a case of [[judicial activism]], where the court overturned most laws restricting abortion on the basis of a [[privacy law|right to privacy]] inferred from the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Some Republicans have actively sought to block judges whom they see as being [[judicial activism|activist judges]] and have sought the appointment of judges who claim to practice [[judicial restraint]]. Other Republicans, though, argue that it is the right of judges to extend the interpretation of the Constitution and judge actions by the legislative or executive branches as legal or [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] on previously unarticulated grounds. The issue of [[judicial deference]] to the legislature is a matter of some debate&nbsp;<U+2014> like the Democrats, most Republicans criticize court decisions that overturn their own (conservative) legislation as overstepping bounds and support decisions that overturn opposing legislation. Some commentators have advocated that the Republicans take a more aggressive approach and support legislative supremacy more firmly.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew C. McCarthy |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTZmYzY4YzkzYzYxMjY4MzAxZjI4NDdjMmVlYTNmMDQ= |title=Judicial Restraint |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

The Republican Party has supported various bills within the last decade to strip some or all federal courts of the ability to hear certain types of cases, in an attempt to limit judicial review. These [[jurisdiction stripping]] laws have included removing federal review of the recognition of same-sex marriage with the [[Marriage Protection Act of 2007|Marriage Protection Act]],<ref>{{cite web|author=By 12:11 a.m., Thursday, July 22, 2004 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040722-121146-3494r.htm |title=House to debate court stripping |publisher=Washington Times |date=2004-07-22 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the [[Pledge Protection Act]], and the rights of detainees in Guantanamo Bay in the [[Detainee Treatment Act]]. The Supreme Court overruled the last of these limitations in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]''.

Compared with Democrats, many Republicans believe in a more robust version of [[federalism]] with greater limitations placed upon [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] power and a larger role reserved for the [[U.S. state|States]]. Following this view on [[federalism]], Republicans often take a less expansive reading of congressional power under the [[Commerce Clause]], such as in the opinion of [[William Rehnquist]] in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]''. Many Republicans on the more libertarian wing wish for a more dramatic narrowing of [[Commerce Clause]] power by revisiting, among other cases, ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', a case that held that growing wheat on a farm for consumption on the same farm fell under congressional power to [[Commerce Clause|"regulate commerce ... among the several States"]].

President [[George W. Bush]] was a proponent of the [[unitary executive theory]] and cited it within his [[Signing statement (United States)|signing statements]] about legislation passed by Congress.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/ Bush challenges hundreds of laws] [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner.</ref> The administration's interpretation of the unitary executive theory was called seriously into question by ''[[Hamdan v.

Rumsfeld'', p. 72]</ref> Following the ruling, the Bush administration has sought Congressional authorization for programs started only on executive mandate, as was the case with the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]], or abandoned programs it had previously asserted executive authority to enact, in the case of the [[National Security Agency]] [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|domestic wiretapping program]].

===Environmental policies===
Some Republicans are skeptical of anthropogenic [[global warming]] and question scientific studies on the impact of human activity on climate change. Instead, they assert that global warming is part of a natural cyclical phenomenon, or is caused by a number of other alternative factors.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} 
The Republican Party has supported the protection of the environment. Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the modern U.S. [[National Park Service]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Filler, Daniel |title=Theodore Roosevelt: Conservation as the Guardian of Democracy |url=http://pantheon.cis.yale.edu/~thomast/essays/filler/filler.html |accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> President [[Richard Nixon]] was responsible for establishing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nixon, Richard |title=Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 |date=1970-07-09 |url=http://www.epa.gov/history/org/origins/reorg.htm |accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> More recently, [[California]] Republican Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], with the support of 16 other states, [[filing (legal)|sued]] the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] for the right to set vehicle emission standards higher than the [[US emission standard|Federal Standard]],<ref>{{cite news |author=Schwarzenegger, Arnold |title=California will Sue Federal Government|date=2007-12-07 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/20/california.emissions/ |accessdate=2008-01-08|publisher=CNN}}</ref> a right to which California is entitled under the [[Clean Air Act]].

This association however has shifted as the Democratic Party came to also support environmentalism. President [[George W. Bush]] has publicly opposed ratification of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]s on the grounds that they unfairly targeted Western industrialized nations such as the United States while giving developing Global South polluters such as [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[India]] a pass. Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]] also never sent the Kyoto treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification as he also thought it unfair to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bush, George W. |title=Text of a Letter from the President| date=2001-03-13 |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html |archiveurl= |accessdate=2007-11-09}}{{Dead link|date=February 2009}}</ref>

In 2000, the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support for the development of market-based solutions to environmental problems. According to the platform, "economic prosperity and environmental protection must advance together, environmental regulations should be based on science, the government<U+2019>s role should be to provide market-based incentives to develop the technologies to meet environmental standards, we should ensure that environmental policy meets the needs of localities, and environmental policy should focus on achieving results processes."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Encourage Market-Based Solutions to Environmental Problems |journal=OnTheIssues |date=2000-08-12}}</ref>

McCain supports the [[Emissions trading|cap-and-trade]] policy, a policy that is quite popular among Democrats but much less so among other Republicans. Most Republicans support increased [[oil well|oil drilling]] in currently protected areas such as the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], a position that has drawn sharp criticism from some activists.

===Social policies===
The 2004 Republican platform expressed support for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] to define marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman. A majority of the GOP's national and state candidates are [[pro-life]] and oppose elective [[abortion]] on religious or moral grounds, and favor [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|faith-based initiatives]]. There are some exceptions, though, especially in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and Pacific Coast states. They are generally against [[affirmative action]] for women and some minorities often describing it as a [[racial quota|quota system]], believing that it is not [[meritocratic]] and that is counter-productive socially by only further promoting [[discrimination]]. Many Republicans support race-neutral admissions policies in universities but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/15/bush.affirmativeaction/ | work=CNN | title=Bush criticizes university 'quota system' | date=2003-01-15 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Eilperin |first=Juliet |title=Watts Walks a Tightrope on Affirmative Action |publisher=The Washington Post |date=1998-05-12 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/affirm/stories/aa051298.htm |accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> Most of the GOP's membership favors [[capital punishment]] and stricter punishments as a means to prevent crime. Republicans generally support [[Gun politics in the United States|gun ownership rights]] and oppose laws regulating guns, although some Republicans in urban areas sometimes favor limited restrictions on the grounds that they are necessary to protect safety in large cities.

Most Republicans support [[school choice]] through [[charter school]]s and [[school voucher]]s for private schools; many have denounced the performance of the public school system and the teachers' unions. The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools, most prominently in recent years with the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001. Many Republicans, however, opposed the creation of the [[United States Department of Education]] when it was initially created in 1979.

Some in the religious wing of the party support voluntary [[School prayer|organized prayer in public schools]] and the teaching of [[intelligent design]] in science classes. Although the GOP has voted for increases in government funding of scientific research, some members actively oppose the federal funding of [[embryonic stem cell]] research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human [[embryo]]s (which many consider ethically equivalent to [[abortion]]), while arguing for applying research money into [[adult stem cell]] or amniotic stem cell research. The stem cell issue has garnered two once-rare vetoes on research funding bills from President Bush, who said the research "crossed a moral boundary".

Generally speaking, most Republicans have opposed government recognition of same-sex unions such as with [[Same-sex marriage in the U.S.|same-sex marriage]]. This opposition formed a key method of energizing conservative voters, the Republican base, in the 2004 election. A ''New York Times'' and [[CBS News]] collaborative poll released in April 2009 reported that 18% of Republicans favored recognition of same-sex marriage.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/us/politics/28web-nagourney.html|title=Signs G.O.P.

However, majorities of 52% and 58% among Republicans in both 2004 and 2009 opposed the policy and supported open enlistment, according to Gallup polling.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/120764/conservatives-shift-favor-openly-gay-service-members.aspx|title=Conservatives Shift in Favor of Openly Gay Service Members|publisher=[[Gallup|Gallup.com]]|date=June 5, 2009|first=Lymari|last=Morales}}</ref>

Groups pushing for LGBT issues inside the party include [[Log Cabin Republicans]] and [[GOProud]]. Fox News national [[exit polls]] of self-described LGBT voters found that 24% voted Republican in 2004 and in 2006. That value was 19% and 31% in 2008 and 2010, respectively.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/06/gop-gains-traction-gay-voters-focusing-economy-analyst-says/|title=GOP Gains Traction Among Gay Voters By Focusing on Economy, Analyst Says|publisher=FoxNews.com|date=November 6, 2010}}</ref>

===National defense and military spending===
Although the Republican Party has always advocated a strong national defense, historically they disapproved of interventionist foreign policy actions. Republicans opposed [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s intervention in [[World War I]] and his subsequent attempt to create the [[League of Nations]]. They were also staunchly opposed to intervention in [[World War II]] prior to the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. In the 1990s, although [[George H. W. Bush]] supported fighting in the [[Gulf War]], Republicans opposed the intervention of the United States in [[Somalia]] and the [[Balkans]]; and in 2000, [[George W. Bush]] ran on a platform that opposed these types of involvement in foreign conflicts.

Today,{{When|date=February 2010}} some in the Republican Party support [[unilateralism]] on issues of national security, believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and [[international relations]] is heavily influenced by the theories of [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] and [[Political realism|realism]], characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's [[Evil empire|Evil Empire]] stance on the [[Soviet Union]] and George W. Bush's [[Axis of evil]].

Republicans secured gains in the [[United States congressional elections, 2002|2002]] and [[United States congressional elections, 2004|2004 elections]], with the [[War on Terror]] being one of the top issues favoring them. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], some in the party support [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] policies with regard to the War on Terror, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|2001 war in Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

The doctrine of [[preemptive war]], wars to disarm and destroy potential military foes based on speculation of future attacks rather than in defense against actual attack, has been advocated by prominent members of the Bush administration, but the war within Iraq has undercut the influence of this doctrine within the Republican Party. [[Rudy Giuliani]], mayor of New York at the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and a candidate for the Republican [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential nomination in 2008]], has stated his support for that policy, saying America must keep itself "on the offensive" against terrorists. <!--I'm pretty sure we can come up with an equivalent McCain quote. Anyone want to try?-->

The Bush administration took the position that the [[Geneva Conventions]] do not apply to [[unlawful combatant]]s, saying they apply to soldiers serving in the armies of [[nation state]]s and not [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist organizations]] such as [[Al-Qaeda]]. The Supreme Court overruled this position in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', which held that the Geneva Conventions were legally binding and must be followed in regards to all enemy combatants. Prominent Republicans such as Senator [[John McCain]], Governor [[Mike Huckabee]], and Representative [[Ron Paul]] strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which they view as torture.

===Other international policies===
The Republican leadership supports a strong Israel, but supports efforts to secure peace in the
Middle East between Israel and its [[Islamic]] neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadiancoalition.com/adbusters01/ |title=Authorization Required |publisher=canadiancoalition.com}}</ref>

The party, through former U.N. Ambassador [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], has advocated reforms in the [[United Nations]] to halt corruption such as that which afflicted the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]]. Some Republicans oppose the [[Kyoto Protocol]] while others have supported it. The party strongly promotes [[free trade]] agreements, most notably [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], [[Dominican Republic&nbsp;<U+2013> Central America Free Trade Agreement|CAFTA]] and now an effort to go further south to [[Brazil]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]].

Republicans are divided on how to confront [[illegal immigration]] between a platform that allows for migrant workers and easing citizenship guidelines, and enforcement-first nationalist approach. In general, pro-growth advocates within the Republican Party support more immigration, and traditional or populist conservatives oppose it. In 2006, the White House supported and Senate passed [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006|comprehensive immigration reform]] that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but the House, taking an enforcement-first approach, refused to go along.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blanton |first=Dana |title=National Exit Poll: Midterms Come Down to Iraq, Bush |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2006-11-08 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,228104,00.html |accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref>

===Political status of Puerto Rico===
The Republican Party has expressed its support for the [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]] of [[Puerto Rico]] to exercise their right to determine a future permanent non-territorial political status with government by consent, full enfranchisement and to be admitted to the union as a fully sovereign [[U.S. state]]. Puerto Rico has been under U.S. sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917; but the island<U+2019>s ultimate status still has not been determined and its 3.9 million residents still do not have voting representation in their national government. The following is the appropriate section from the 2008 party platform (unchanged from the 2004 and 2000 platforms).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gop.com/media/2004platform.pdf |title=2004 Republican Platform |publisher=Gop.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letpuertoricodecide.com/status.php |title=An Introduction to Puerto Rico's Status Debate |publisher=Let Puerto Rico Decide |date=1998-03-04 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>[http://platform.gop.com/2008Platform.pdf 2008 Republican Platform]</ref>
<blockquote>We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine.  We recognize that Congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for Puerto Rico to achieve a permanent non-territorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement.  As long as Puerto Rico is not a state, however, the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the U.S. government.</blockquote>

'''''Business community'''''. The GOP is usually seen as the traditionally pro-business party and it garners major support from a wide variety of industries from the [[finance|financial]] sector to small businesses. Republicans are about 50 percent more likely to be self-employed, and are more likely to work in the area of management.<ref>Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans&nbsp;<U+2014> Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 104<U+2013>5, 125.</ref>

'''''Race'''''. While historically the party had been supporters of rights for blacks since the 1860s, it lost its  leadership position; the GOP has been winning under 15% of the black vote in recent national elections (1980 to 2008). The party has recently nominated African American candidates for senator or governor in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland, though none were successful. In the 2010 elections, two African American Republicans were elected to the US House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web|author=L.A.

They became one of the core components of the [[New Deal Coalition]].

In recent decades, the party has been moderately successful in gaining support from [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian American]] voters. George W. Bush, who campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes, received 35% of their vote in 2000 and 44% in 2004.<ref name=2004cnnexitpolls>{{cite news |title=Exit Polls |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.4.html |date=2004-11-02|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> The party's strong [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance has made it popular among some minority groups from current and former Communist states, in particular [[Cuban American]]s, [[Korean American]]s, [[Chinese American]]s, and [[Vietnamese American]]s.

For decades, a greater percentage of white voters identified themselves as Democrats, rather than Republicans. However, since the mid-1990s whites have been more likely to self-identify as Republicans than Democrats.<ref>Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans&nbsp;<U+2014> Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 321.</ref>

'''''Family status'''''. In recent elections, Republicans have found their greatest support among whites from married couples with children living at home.<ref>[http://blog.vdare.com/archives/2005/05/08/affordable-family-formation-the-neglected-key-to-gops-future/ Affordable Family Formation<U+2013>The Neglected Key To GOP<U+2019>s Future] by Steve Sailer</ref> Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Kerry in 2004.<ref>[http://www.wvwv.org/docs/WVWV_2004_post-election_memo.pdf Unmarried Women in the 2004 Presidential Election]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} ([[PDF]]).

Indeed, the 25-point margin Kerry posted among unmarried women represented one of the high water marks for the Senator among all demographic groups."</ref>

'''''Income'''''. Low-income voters tend to favor the Democratic Party while high-income voters tend to support the Republican Party.  President George W. Bush won 41% of the poorest 20% of voters in 2004, 55% of the richest twenty percent, and 53% of those in between. In the 2006 House races, the voters with incomes over $50,000 were 49% Republican, while those under were 38%.<ref name=2006cnnexitpolls />

'''''Military'''''. Republicans hold a large majority in the armed services, with 57% of active military personnel and 66% of officers identified as Republican in 2003.<ref name="Lobe, J.

Regarding graduate-level degrees (masters or doctorate), there is a rough parity between Democrats and Republicans. According to the Gallup Organization: "[B]oth Democrats and Republicans have equal numbers of Americans at the upper end of the educational spectrum&nbsp;<U+2014> that is, with post graduate degrees..."<ref>Frank Newport, "Who are the Democrats?," ''The Gallup News Service''(August 11, 2000), as cited in Joseph Fried, ''Democrats and Republicans&nbsp;<U+2014> Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York, Algora Publishing, 2008) 74.</ref> Fried provides a slightly more detailed analysis, noting that Republican men are more likely than Democratic men to have advanced degrees, but Democratic women are now more likely than Republican women to have advanced degrees.<ref>Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans&nbsp;<U+2014> Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 76<U+2013>7.</ref>

'''''Sexual Orientation'''''. Exit polls conducted in 2000, 2004 and 2006 indicate that about one quarter of gay and lesbian Americans voted for the GOP. In recent years, many in the party have opposed [[same-sex marriage]], adoption by same-sex couples, inclusion of sexual orientation in federal hate crimes laws, the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], while supporting the use of the [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy within the military. Some members of the party, particularly in the Northeast and Pacific coast, support [[civil union]]s and adoption rights for same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Republican_Party.htm#Civil_Rights Republican Party on the Issues |title=Civil_Rights Republican Party on the Issues |accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> The opposition to some gay rights found in the Republican Party largely comes from the socially conservative wing of the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2091413/|title=A Common Missed Conception: Why religious people are against gay marriage.}}</ref>

'''''Religion'''''. Religion has always played a major role for both parties but, in the course of a century, the parties' religious compositions have changed. Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], with Catholics, Jews, and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic, and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the late 1960s that undercut the [[New Deal coalition]]. Voters who attend church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]; those who attend occasionally gave him only 47%, while those who never attend gave him 36%. Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of Catholics (even though [[John Kerry|Kerry]] was Catholic). Since 1980, large majorities of [[evangelism|evangelicals]] have voted Republican; 70<U+2013>80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004, and 70% for GOP House candidates in [[United States general elections, 2006|2006]]. Jews continue to vote 70<U+2013>80% Democratic. Democrats have close links with the African American churches, especially the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptists]], while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54-46 in the 2010 midterms.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1791/2010-midterm-elections-exit-poll-religion-vote |title=Religion in the 2010 Elections  |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> The main line traditional Protestants (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians) have dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968). Their church memberships have declined in that time as well, and the conservative evangelical rivals have grown. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], commonly known as [[Mormon]]s, are overwhelmingly Republican and vote in line with the Christian Right. George W. Bush received 89% of the Mormon vote.<ref>Robert Booth Fowler et al., ''Religion and Politics in America: Faith, Culture, and Strategic Choices'' (2004)</ref> Bush also received almost 80% of the [[Muslim]] vote in the 2000 Presidential election. However, his support among Muslims declined sharply and, by the 2004 election, at least half of those voters supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[John Kerry]] or a third party candidate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Beutler | August 18, 2010, 11:10AM |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/08/republican-muslims-to-gop-youre-on-thin-ice.php |title=GOP Muslims Fear Failure Of Bush Outreach Efforts After Anti-Mosque Furor &#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>

'''''Location'''''. Since 1980, geographically the Republican "base" ("[[Red states and blue states|red states]]") is strongest in the [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Midwest]], and [[Mountain States|Mountain West]]. While it is weakest on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] and [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] this has not always been the case; historically the northeast was a bastion of the Republican Party with [[Vermont]] and [[Maine]] being the only two states to vote against [[Franklin Roosevelt]] all four times. The [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] has been roughly balanced since 1854, with [[Illinois]] becoming more Democratic and liberal because of the city of Chicago and [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]] more Republican since 1990. [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]] both trend Republican. Since the 1930s, the Democrats have dominated most central cities, while the Republicans now dominate rural areas and the majority of suburbs.<ref name="CNN.com Election 2004">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html|title= Election 2004|accessdate=2007-06-01 | work=CNN}}</ref>

The South has become solidly Republican in national elections since 1980, and has been trending Republican at the state level since then at a slower pace.<ref>Earl Black and Merle Black. ''Politics and Society in the South'' (2005)</ref> In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%-30% among Southern whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70-30 lead among the 29% of the voters who were black or Hispanic. One-third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they voted for Bush by 80-20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.<ref name=2006cnnexitpolls /><ref name=2004cnnexitpolls />

The Republican Party's strongest focus of political influence lies in the [[Great Plains]] states, particularly [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Dakota]], and [[North Dakota]], and in the [[Mountain states]] of [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] (Utah gave George W. Bush more than 70% of the popular vote in 2004). These states are sparsely populated with few major urban centers, and have majority white populations, making it extremely difficult for Democrats to create a sustainable voter base there. Unlike the South, these areas have been strongly Republican since before the party realignments of the 1960s. The Great Plains states were one of the few areas of the country where Republicans had any significant support during the [[Great Depression]].

'''''Conservatives and Moderates'''''.  Republican "conservatives" are strongest in the South, Mountain West and Midwest, where they draw support from religious conservatives. The "[[moderate]]s" tend to dominate the party in New England, and used to be well represented in all states. From the 1940s to the 1970s under such leaders as [[Thomas E. Dewey]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Nelson Rockefeller]], and [[Richard Nixon]], they usually dominated the presidential wing of the party. Since the 1970s, they have been less powerful, though they are always represented in the cabinets of Republican presidents. In [[Vermont]], [[Jim Jeffords]], a Republican Senator became an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] in 2001 due to growing disagreement with President Bush and the party leadership.  In addition, moderate Republicans have recently held the governorships in several New England States, while [[Lincoln Chafee]], a former moderate Republican senator is currently the independent governor of Rhode Island. Senators [[Olympia Snowe]] and [[Susan Collins]] of [[Maine]] and Senator [[Scott Brown]] of [[Massachusetts]] are notable moderate Republicans from New England. From 1991 to 2007, moderate Republicans served as Governor of Massachusetts.

Since the 1980s, [[talk radio]] audiences and hosts have tended to favor conservative causes. Some well-known radio hosts include [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Sean Hannity]], [[Glenn Beck]], [[Neal Boortz]], [[Laura Ingraham]], [[Michael Reagan]], [[Howie Carr]], and [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]].

==Trends==
As of 2004, the Republican Party had remained fairly cohesive, as both strong [[Economic liberalism|economic libertarians]] and [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] opposed the Democrats, whom they saw as the party of bloated and more secular, liberal government.<ref>Wooldridge, Adrian and John Micklethwait. ''The Right Nation'' (2004).</ref> Yet, some libertarians have argued that the GOP's policies have grown increasingly restrictive of personal liberties, and has contributed to increasing [[corporate welfare]] and [[national debt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2730251|title=Evans, B.

''The Associated Press''.|accessdate=2007-07-11}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Some social conservatives have expressed dissatisfaction with the party's support for economic policies that they see as sometimes in conflict with their moral values.<ref name="scare">[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/12/huckabees_rebellion.html How Huckabee Scares the GOP].
