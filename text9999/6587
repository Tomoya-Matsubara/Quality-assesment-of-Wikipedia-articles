A '''valley''' or '''a low area between two hills''' '''dale''' (in [[Scotland]], a '''glen''') is a [[landform]], which can range from a few [[square kilometre|square kilometre]]s to hundreds or even thousands of square kilometres in area. It is typically a low-lying area of [[Landscape|land]], surrounded by higher areas such as [[mountain]]s or [[hill]]s. It can also be seen as a path between two mountains, or a [[Depression (geology)|depression]] in a single mountain.

==Genesis of valleys==

Valleys are formed by numerous geographical processes. [[U-shaped valley|Glacial valley]]s, which are usually U- rather than V-shaped, were formed tens of thousands of years ago (most likely during the last [[Ice Age]]) by the massive erosive power of [[glaciers]]. Several glacial valleys can be found in the English [[Lake District]] and many can be found in [[Alpine countries]]. [[Rift valley]]s, such as the [[Great Rift Valley]], are formed by the expansion of the [[Earth]]'s crust due to [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] activity beneath the Earth's surface.  Valleys are, however, most commonly formed by [[fluvial]] activity (the action of running water, such as [[river]]s), which [[erosion|erode]]s the landscape.

==Valley floors==

Usually the bottom of a [[main valley]] is broad - independent of the U or V shape. It ranges from about 1 to 5 km and is filled with mountain [[sediment]]s. The shape of the floor can be rather [[horizontal]], similar to a flat [[cylinder]], or [[terrace]]d.
[[Side valley]]s are rather V than U-shaped; near the mouth [[clammy|clammies]] are possible if it is a [[hanging valley]]. The location of the [[village]]s depends on the across-valley profile, on [[climate]] and local traditions, and on the danger of [[avalanche]]s or [[landslide]]s. Predominant are places on terraces or [[alluvial fan]]s if they exist.

The villages of the primary valleys, however, have to consider mainly the danger of possible [[flood]]ing.

==Hollows==

A '''hollow''' is loose name for a valley in the [[earth]]. It is commonly used in [[New England]], [[Missouri]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to describe such geographic features. Also used in [[Southern Appalachia]], but pronounced "holler." Hollows may be formed by [[river]] valleys such as [[Mansfield Hollow]] or they may be relatively dry clefts with a [[notch]]-like characteristic in that they have a height of land and consequent [[water]] divide in their bases. A hollow such as this is [[Boston Hollow]]. A Tourists in Europe can further visit a lot of [[karst]], [[stalactite]] and [[ice hollow]]s (e.g. in [[Slovenia]] and [[Austria]]).

==Extraterrestrial valleys==

[[natural satellite|Moon]] and the other [[terrestrial planet]]s of our Solar System can also have [[valley shape|valley-like]] features. [[List of valleys on the Moon|Lunar valleys]] could be formed due to a linked chain of [[impact crater]]s. Smaller valleys, known as [[rille]]s, can originated from [[lava]] flows or because of contractions in cooling lava [[sheet]]s.
Besides the lunar [[Impact crater|craters]], the details of mountain ranges ([[Lunar Alps]], Carpathes etc.) have been well known for more than 300 years (e.g. [[Johann Hieronymus Schr<U+00F6>ter|J.H. Schr<U+00F6>ter]]'s ''Selenotopographische Fragmente'' of [[1791]]). A lot of linear phenomena like [[Vallis Rheita|Rheita]] or Schr<U+00F6>ter valley and the famous '''[[Vallis Alpes]]''' (see also below) were observed with details less than 1 km (which corresponds to a coin seen from 5-10 km distance)&mdash;but the geological genesis was in discussion up to the [[Apollo 11]] mission of summer 1969. [[Astronomer]]s have long been able to observe some [[highland]]s and the "[[snow|Nix]] Olympica" on Mars, and therefore guessed that there may be extraterrestrial valleys, too.  In the 1970s this interpretation was proven correct by a series of [[space probe]]s.  Valleys have also been found on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and on the volcanic surfaces of [[Venus]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]].

The largest valley in our [[solar system]] is the '''[[Valles Marineris]]''' formation on [[Mars]]. The ''Valles'' (which were first detected in [[1877]] by [[Martian canals|Schiaparelli]]) are a huge [[canyon]] system, 4,500 x 600 km in area and up to 8 km in depth. These enormous dimensions are 4-8 times greater than those of the American "Grand Canyon". The ''Valles'' is currently understood to have been created by [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] forces like the main [[graben]]s on Earth, rather than by running water.  In later stages, however, it has been ''expanded'' considerably by erosion, possibly including the action of surface water.
Several volcanic or [[ice|icy]] [[natural satellite|moons]] of the gas planets [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]] and [[Neptune]] were also photographed by the two [[Voyager program|Voyagers]], as well as other space probes. Some linear ruptures in the ice or apparent low areas between hills have been interpreted by [[astrogeology|astrogeologists]] as tectonic structures or valleys similar to [[graben]] or active geologic lines on Earth.
