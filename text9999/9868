'''Rafael Osuna Herrera ''' (September 15, 1938 &ndash; June 4, 1969) is the most successful tennis player in the history of Mexico. He was born in [[Mexico City]], Mexico, and is best remembered for his singles victory at the U.S. Open Championships in 1963 and for leading Mexico to its only Davis Cup Final round appearance.  He is the only Mexican to date to be inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]], in 1979.

== Career ==
His first successes as an athlete occurred before he was ten years old, when he competed in the open category of the Mexican National Table Tennis Championships.  In the course of the tournament, he upset the Mexico City Table Tennis Champion in singles, a feat remarkable both for Osuna's young age and the fact that it was his first tournament. Osuna also won the Doubles Championship, with Alfredo Ramos Uriarte as his partner. From age 10 to 14 he was ranked in the top 10 in Mexico's Open singles in table tennis.

He was awarded a full scholarship to attend the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) in the U.S.A., by Head Coach [[George Toley]], who quickly identified Osuna as a major talent.  Osuna participated in the 1960 Wimbledon championships, competing only in the doubles category with [[Dennis Ralston]] (soon to be his roommate at school).  The two unknown youngsters soon made history, as the first unseeded pair to win the men's doubles at Wimbledon.

This victory marked the beginning of Osuna's career and fame.  Described as an "agile and cerebral player"<ref>{{Cite journal | journal=Sports Illustrated | title=It Was Anybody's Championship<U+2014>until A Mexican With A Deft Touch Made It His | date=September 16, 1983 | last=Bingham | first=Walter | postscript=<!--None--> | url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1075180/index.htm}}</ref> who "moves on the tennis court with the grace of a panther" (Tony Mottram), his subsequent achievements include:

* He is the only Mexican tennis player ever ranked No. 1 in the world, in 1963, by the International Tennis Federation.<ref>{{cite book  | first=Bud | last=Collins | coauthors=Xander Hollander | year=1996 | title=Bud Collins' Tennis Encyclopedia | pages=485<U+2013>6 | publisher=Visible Ink Press | isbn=1578590000}}</ref>
* He is the only Mexican tennis player ever to win a Grand Slam event singles title, The United States Tennis Association National Championships US Open Singles (1963).  He is one of only three Latin Americans to win the [[US Championships]], along with [[Guillermo Vilas]] and [[Juan Mart<U+00ED>n del Potro]].
* Osuna and Palafox are the only Mexican tennis players ever to win the US Open doubles title, in 1962.
* In 1962, as the leader of the Mexican Davis Cup Team, Osuna led the team to its only Davis Cup Final to date, and the first-ever final reached by a Latin American country.
* His last victory, two weeks before his death in a plane crash, was an almost single-handed defeat of Australia in Davis Cup competition; Osuna won both his singles matches and the doubles.  At that time Australia had won the Davis Cup 17 times, and the defeat was considered a major upset.<ref>{{Cite journal | journal=Sports Illustrated | title=A Roundup Of The Sports Information Of The Week | date=June 16, 1969 | postscript=<!--None--> | url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082520/3/index.htm}}</ref>
* USTA National Hard Courts singles and doubles champion 1962 and doubles champion 1969.
* Osuna was NCAA singles champion in 1962, doubles champion from 1961<U+2013>1963, and team champion in 1962-63.<ref>{{cite book  | first=Bud | last=Collins | coauthors=Xander Hollander | year=1996 | title=Bud Collins' Tennis Encyclopedia | pages=485<U+2013>6 | publisher=Visible Ink Press | isbn=1578590000}}</ref>  The 1963 USC tennis team is regarded by some as the best collegiate tennis team of all time.
* Osuna won Mexico's only Olympic gold medal in tennis, in men's doubles with Vincent Zaraz<U+00FA>a in 1968.
* Osuna earned a Bachelor in Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1963.  In that same year, the International Tennis Federation would declare him the year-end No. 1 player in the world.

== Style ==
Osuna was known for his footspeed, touch, and tactical awareness.  Commentator Bud Collins dubs him "Mexico's greatest player...Ubiquitous on court, confusing to foes, ever seeking the net".<ref>Collins, p. 485-6</ref>  His U.S. Open victory came against big server [[Frank Froehling]], a dangerous unseeded opponent who had upset top-seeded [[Roy Emerson]] in the semifinals.  Collins describes Osuna's victory as a triumph of tactical play:

{{Bquote|...Osuna cleverly neutralized [Froehling's] power with wonderfully conceived and executed tactics, especially lobbed service returns from 10 to 12 feet behind the baseline.  Occasionally Osuna would stand in and take Froehling's serve on the rise, chipping the backhand, but more often he lobbed returns to disrupt Froehling's serve-volley rhythm and break down his suspect overhead. In fact, Osuna climbed the wall of the stadium to retrieve smashes and float back perfect lobs, frustrating Froehling with his nimble speed around the court, touch and tactical variations.<ref>Collins, p. 163.</ref>}}

== Death ==
Osuna was one of 79 people killed in the crash of Mexicana de Aviaci<U+00F3>n Flight 704 on June 4, 1969.  He was 30 years old.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/pda/A17090697?s_id=6 | title=Famous Air Crash Victims}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | journal=Sports Illustrated | title=A Roundup Of The Sports Information Of The Week | date=June 16, 1969 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/famous1960s.htm |title=Famous People Who Died in Aviation Accidents 1960s}}</ref>

== Posthumous honors ==
Osuna has received numerous posthumous honors, including:

* During the 1969 National Championships, the Intercollegiate Tennis College Association NCAA instituted the Rafael Osuna Sportsmanship Award, the first new award added since 1881.  Given to the most outstanding college tennis player, the criteria for the award are competitive excellence, sportsmanship, and contribution to tennis.

* During the 1969 US Open Championships at Forest Hills, two months after his death, the US Open Committee declared the 28 of August to be [[Rafael Osuna Day]], honoring the memory of the former champion.  This was the first time the tournament had honored a tennis player in this manner.

* In 1969 the Chapultepec Club, the cathedral of Mexican tennis and home to the majority of its history, named its stadium "Rafael Osuna".

* In 1972, with the intent to strengthen ties between the USA and Mexico and to honor the memory of the only player ever to win the US Championships and the Mexican Open championships in singles, the "Osuna Cup" event was instituted.
