==History==
{{main|History of Major League Soccer}}

{{see also|Soccer in Canada|Soccer in the United States}}
Major League Soccer is the most recent of a series of professional men's premier national professional [[soccer]] leagues established in the United States and Canada.
The predecessor of MLS was the [[North American Soccer League (1968<U+2013>84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL), which played from 1968 until 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/02/by-the-numbers-north-american-soccer-league-vs-major-league-soccer.html|title=By The Numbers<U+2026> North American Soccer League vs Major League Soccer|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

===Establishment===
In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], [[U.S. Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league.<ref name="leagle.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/200022797FSupp2d130_1215|title=FRASER v. MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> In 1993, U.S. Soccer selected Major League Professional Soccer (the precursor to MLS) as the exclusive Division 1 professional soccer league.<ref name="leagle.com" /> Major League Soccer was officially formed in February 1995 as a limited liability company.<ref name="leagle.com" />

MLS began play in 1996 with ten teams. The first game was held on April 6, 1996, as the [[San Jose Clash]] defeated [[D.C. United]] before 31,000 fans at Spartan Stadium in San Jose in a game broadcast on ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1996/04/9/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/MLS-KICKS-OFF-TO-FESTIVE-CROWD-MIXED-ON-FIELD-REVIEWS.aspx?hl=MLS&sc=0|title=MLS KICKS OFF TO FESTIVE CROWD, MIXED ON-FIELD REVIEWS|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> The league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in MLS<U+2014>including U.S. stars such as [[Alexi Lalas]], [[Tony Meola]] and [[Eric Wynalda]], and foreign players such as Mexico's [[Jorge Campos]] and Colombia's [[Carlos Valderrama]].<ref>"19 Teams with 1 Goal: A Spotlight on Major League Soccer", June 10, 2014.</ref>
D.C. United won the [[MLS Cup]] in three of the league's first four seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcunited.com/club/trophy-case|title=Trophy Case|work=DC United|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> The league added its first two expansion teams in 1998<U+2014>the [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]] and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]; the Chicago Fire won its first title in its inaugural season.<ref name="Last Word On Sports">{{cite web|url=http://lastwordonsports.com/2014/07/25/mls-3-0-series-history-mls-1-0/|title=MLS 3.0 Series: A History of MLS 1.0|work=Last Word On Sports|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/world-cup-2014/usa-soccer-and-world-cup-2014/resurgence-and-expansion-of-the-mls/|title=Resurgence and Expansion of the MLS|work=Soccer Politics / The Politics of Football|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> The league's low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large [[American football]] stadiums.<ref name="Last Word On Sports"/>
One aspect that had alienated fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to "Americanize" the sport. The league implemented the use of [[Penalty shootout (association football)|shootouts]] to resolve tie games. MLS also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 0:00. The league realized that the rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans, and the shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/1999/11/18/wednesday_teleconference/|title=Shootout banned; TV lineup changed|work=SI.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>
The league's quality was cast into doubt when the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. men's national team]], which was made up largely of MLS players, finished in last place at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]].<ref name="Last Word On Sports"/>

Major League Soccer lost an estimated $250&nbsp;million during its first five years, and more than $350&nbsp;million between its founding and 2004.<ref name=profit>{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Stanley |title=Soccer: Time To Kick It Up A Notch |publisher=''Businessweek'' |date=November 22, 2004 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search%20Soccer:%20Time%20To%20Kick%20It%20Up%20A%20Notch |accessdate=May 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name="nytimes">[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html "For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder"], ''New York Times'', November 11, 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm|title=MLS fans in several cities wait nervously for contraction decision|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html|title=MLS considering weight-loss program|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> 
The league's financial problems led to Commissioner [[Doug Logan]] being replaced by Garber, a former NFL executive, in August 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-08-04/sports/9908040033_1_nfl-international-sunil-gulati-doug-logan|title=Mls Boots Commissioner, Turns To Nfl For Successor|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>
MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]], leaving the league with ten teams.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/01/05/throw-did-eliminating-tampa-miami-save-mls|title=The Throw-In: Did eliminating Tampa, Miami save MLS?|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

Despite the financial problems, though, MLS did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for the league's resurgence. Columbus Crew Stadium, now known as [[Mapfre Stadium]], was built in 1999, becoming MLS's first [[soccer-specific stadium]].<ref name="Columbus Crew history">{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/club/columbus|title=Columbus Crew history|work=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> This began a trend among MLS teams to construct their own venues instead of leasing American football stadiums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.academia.edu/3476449/Making_Soccer_Major_League_in_the_USA_and_Beyond_Major_League_Soccers_First_Decade|title=Making Soccer 'Major League' in the USA and Beyond:Major League Soccer's First Decade|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>
In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, [[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]], that the players had filed in 1996. The court ruled that MLS's policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain solvency and competitive parity.<ref>[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]], 97 F.Supp.2d 130 (D. Mass 2000)</ref>

===Resurgence===
The 2002 World Cup, in which the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] unexpectedly made the quarterfinals, coincided with a resurgence in American soccer and MLS.<ref name="nycfc.com">[http://www.nycfc.com/Fans/Learn-about-MLS "Learn about MLS"], New York City FC. Retrieved August 4, 2014.</ref> [[MLS Cup 2002]] drew 61,316 spectators to [[Gillette Stadium]], the largest attendance in an MLS Cup final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mlscup/2002 |title=MLS Cup 2002 |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=March 16, 2012}}</ref> MLS limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003, and adopted [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) rules in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exittheforest.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/formatting-mls-part-4-global-tradition-american-appeal/|title=Formatting MLS, Part 4: Global Tradition, American Appeal|work=Waldlichtung|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

MLS underwent a transition in the years leading up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent European leagues. For example, [[Tim Howard]] was transferred to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for $4 million in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yanks-abroad.com/content.php?mode=players&id=11|title=Tim Howard club career|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportscape.net/2013/10/five-best-americans-premier-league/|title=Top 5 Americans in the Premier League|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> Many more American players did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, [[Jason Kreis]] became the first player to score 100 career MLS goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6435726/rsl-jason-kreis-to-prove|title=Jason Kreis still has something to prove|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

The league's financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]], so that by the end of 2008, a majority of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.<ref name="Last Word On Sports"/>

It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998. [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] began play in 2005, with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rslsoapbox.com/2012/9/27/3415314/real-salt-lake-vs-chivas-usa-expansion-rivalry-a-history-lesson|title=Real Salt Lake vs. Chivas USA - Expansion rivalry a history lesson|date=September 28, 2012|work=RSL Soapbox|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> By 2006 the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] owners, players and a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion [[Houston Dynamo]], after failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that formed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjearthquakes.com/club/history#2006|title=Quakes History|work=San Jose Earthquakes|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

The [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007 season]] witnessed the MLS debut of [[David Beckham]]. Beckham's signing had been seen as a coup for American soccer, and was made possible by the Designated Player Rule.

Having multiple clubs owned by a single owner was a necessity in the league's first ten years.<ref name="latimes2006"/> At one time [[Phil Anschutz]]'s AEG owned six MLS clubs and [[Lamar Hunt]]'s Hunt Sports owned three franchises.

MLS salaries are limited by a [[Salary cap#Major League Soccer|salary cap]], which MLS has had in place since the league's inception in 1996. The purpose of the salary cap is to prevent the team's owners from unsustainable spending on player salaries <U+2014> a practice that had doomed the North American Soccer League during the 1980s <U+2014> and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams.<ref name="leagle.com"/> The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the ''Fraser v. Major League Soccer'' lawsuit. For the 2014 season, the salary cap is $3.1&nbsp;million per team, and the maximum salary for any one player is $387,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundersfc/2014/03/07/looking-at-changes-to-the-mls-roster-and-competition-rules-for-2014/ |title=Looking at changes to the MLS roster and competition rules for 2014 |first=Joshua |last=Meyers |work=Sounders FC Blog |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]'' |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}</ref>

Teams may augment their squads by signing players from other leagues. MLS has two [[transfer window]]s <U+2014> the primary pre season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early June to early August.<ref name="Roster Rules and Regulations">{{cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations|title=Roster Rules and Regulations|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref> All MLS teams have a limited number of [[MLS International Roster Slots|international roster slots]] that they can use to sign non-domestic players.

MLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning Designated Players, Generation Adidas players, home grown players, and allocation money all allow for additional wage spending that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about an increase in on-field competition.<ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Pat |title=MLS comes out of the gates strong in '07 |publisher=monstersandcritics.com |date=May 4, 2007 |url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=soc-mls/misc/mls_features_archive/mls_features_archive_050407.htm |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>

The [[Designated Player Rule|designated player (DP) rule]] allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the maximum cap, each DP player only counts as $387,500 (the maximum non-DP salary) against the cap. Instituted in 2007, England's [[David Beckham]] was the first signing under the DP rule.<ref>Forbes, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2012/08/05/has-the-beckham-rule-worked-for-mls/ "Has The "Beckham Rule" Worked For MLS?"], August 5, 2012.</ref> The DP rule has led to large income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more than a player earning the league minimum.<ref>http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201,%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf</ref> In the 2013 season 21% of the league's wage spending went to just 5 players, this stretched to 29% on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireofsoccer.com/look-income-inequality-22820/|title=A Look At Income Inequality in MLS|work=Empire of Soccer|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stathunting.com/2014/04/11/mls-salaries-visualized/|title=2014 MLS Salaries Visualized|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

The league operates a [[Generation Adidas]] program, which is a joint venture between MLS and U.S. Soccer that encourages young American players to enter MLS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=354854&cc=5901 |title=US U-20 players headline 2006 class |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=January 11, 2006 |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref> The Generation Adidas program has been in place since 1997, and has introduced players such as [[Landon Donovan]], [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Tim Howard]] and [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]] into MLS.

MLS has required all of its teams to operate youth development programs since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story?id=391065&cc=5901|title=MLS launches youth development initiative|publisher=espnfc.com|date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> Teams have the ability to sign up to two of their own [[Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|home grown players]] to the senior team each year on contracts similar to Generation adidas contracts - which do not count against the MLS salary budget and may earn a much higher salary than the league minimum - to incentivise youth development.

====United States====
As of the 2015 season, MLS matches are broadcast nationally by [[ESPN]] networks and [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] in English, and [[Univision]] networks in Spanish under an eight-year contract. Each broadcaster has a window for national regular season matches, with [[UniMas]] airing a game on Friday nights in Spanish and additional matches on [[Univision Deportes Network]], and [[ESPN Major League Soccer|ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports 1]] airing games on Sunday evenings in English.

Coverage of MLS expanded into Canada in 2007 with the addition of Toronto FC. 
Currently, national MLS broadcast rights in Canada are through the [[The Sports Network|TSN]] networks with a six-year deal for the 2011<U+2013>2016 seasons. TSN and TSN2 broadcast a minimum of 30&nbsp;games during each season, all featuring at least one Canadian team. French-language sister networks [[R<U+00E9>seau des sports|RDS]] and RDS2 have similar broadcast rights. The networks also carry additional games not involving Canadian teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/736931/tsn-becomes-official-broadcaster-of-mls-in-canada-with-landmark-six-year-deal|title=TSN Becomes Official Broadcaster of MLS in Canada with Landmark Six-Year Deal|author=TSN|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=August 21, 2014|authorlink=The Sports Network}}</ref> GolTV Canada carries selected all-U.S. MLS matchups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goltv.ca/assets/1/AssetManager/GolTVCanadaMatches-Mar11-Mar17V3.pdf|title=GolTV Canada Matches for March 11<U+2013>17, 2011|author=GolTV (Canada)|accessdate=March 11, 2011}} (lists carriage of a Los Angeles vs. Seattle MLS game)</ref>

Major League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs of long-term profitability as early as 2004 with the single-entity ownership structure, salary cap, and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United Marketing (SUM) all contributing towards MLS's financial security.<ref name="nytimes" /> As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands, and television coverage increases, MLS has seen its revenues increase while controlling costs.<ref name="Forbes, Major League Soccer 2013"/>

Television coverage and revenue have increased since the league's early years.

===Rules and officials===
MLS follows the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|rules and standards]] of the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB). 
The playoff extra time structure follows IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] if necessary.
Away goals apply to the playoff stage of the competition, but do not apply to [[Overtime (sports)#Knock-out contests (including professional competition)|overtime]] in the second leg of any two-legged playoff series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Competition Rules and Regulations|url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/competition-rules-and-regulations|publisher=MLSsoccer.com|accessdate=March 17, 2014|date=March 2014}}</ref>

===Team names===
:''For more information on MLS team names, see the individual team entries.''

Originally, in the style of other U.S. sports leagues, teams were given nicknames at their creation. Examples include the [[Columbus Crew]], the [[San Jose Earthquakes|San Jose Clash]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]. Several of the club names in MLS originated with earlier professional soccer clubs, such as the 1970s-era [[North American Soccer League (1968<U+2013>84)|NASL]] team names [[San Jose Earthquakes (1974<U+2013>1988)|San Jose Earthquakes]], [[Seattle Sounders (1974<U+2013>1983)|Seattle Sounders]], [[Portland Timbers (1975<U+2013>1982)|Portland Timbers]] and [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1974<U+2013>84)|Vancouver Whitecaps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prostamerika.com/2012/09/24/toye-fans-are-delighted-the-old-nasl-names-sounders-timbers-whitecaps-and-quakes-were-saved/71346|title=Toye: Fans are delighted the old NASL names, Sounders, Timbers, Whitecaps and Quakes were saved|publisher=|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

United]] and [[Miami Fusion|Miami Fusion F.C.]] were the only two MLS teams to adopt European naming conventions during the 1990s.<ref name="dc united name">{{cite book|last=Dure|first=Beau|title=Long Range Goals: The Success Story of Major League Soccer|year=2010|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Dulles, Virginia|isbn=978-1-59797-509-4|pages=21<U+2013>23}}</ref> However, European-style names have increased in MLS, with expansion teams such as [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Toronto FC]], in addition to 2015 entrants [[New York City FC]] and [[Orlando City Soccer Club (2015)|Orlando City S.C.]], along with several re-brandings such as the Dallas Burn (now [[FC Dallas]]) and Kansas City Wizards (now [[Sporting Kansas City]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/2010/11/will-the-kansas-city-wizards-become.html?page=all|title=Will the Kansas City Wizards become Sporting Kansas City?|date=November 16, 2010|work=Kansas City Business Journal|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}</ref>
