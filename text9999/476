'''Castle Lake''' is a glacial lake (''[[cirque]] lake'' or [[tarn (lake)|tarn]]) located in northern [[California]] along the eastern edge of the [[Klamath Mountains]], in [[Siskiyou County]], near the city of [[Mt. Shasta, California|Mt. Shasta]].  The outlet of the lake drains into Castle Lake Creek, and then into [[Lake Siskiyou]]; the lake is part of the headwaters of the [[Sacramento River]].  Nearly all of the lake's {{convert|47|acre|ha|abbr=on}} are within the [[Shasta-Trinity National Forest]].<ref name = USFS> [http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/shastatrinity/recreation/st-main/st-fishing/alpine-lakes/castle.shtml USFS site] accessed 2008-01-14.</ref>  Trails lead from Castle Lake into the adjacent Castle Crags Wilderness Area, and on to [[Castle Crags State Park]], including trails to Little Castle Lake and Heart Lake.<ref name = CCWA>[http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/shastatrinity/documents/st-main/maps/rogs/mt-shasta/c-crags.pdf Wilderness Area site] accessed 2008-01-14.</ref>  [[Fishing]], [[camping]], and [[hiking]] are also available at or near the lake.

About one-quarter mile (400 m) north of Castle Lake is a campground.  At the lake itself, fishing and picnicking, as well as viewing the local plantlife, wildlife and scenery, are common activities.  The lake waters can be cool, so [[swimming]] is generally limited to summer months.  [[Kayaking]], [[rowboat]]ing and [[raft]]ing are available on the lake.

==Formation of Castle Lake==
[[Image:Castlelake 2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Castle Lake with the [[headwall]] at the right, and the [[terminal moraine]] at the left.]]
The lake's origins date to the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene Era]] (more than 10,000 years ago) when a [[glacier]] carved a basin in the location of the current lake.  During that era, much of North America was glaciated.<ref name = CLLRS/>   Castle Lake is a typical glacier ''[[cirque]]'' lake (or tarn), reaching depths of up to {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=on}} near the southern, [[granitic]] part of the lakeshore (the ''cirque face'').<ref name = CLLRS>[http://castlelake.ucdavis.edu/geography/castle_lake "Granite is the predominate mineral in Castle Lake and in the <nowiki>[nearby]</nowiki> mountains . . ." (Castle Lake Limnological Research Station site)] accessed 2008-01-14.</ref>   There is a [[terminal moraine]] of [[boulders]] and [[gravel]] forming a natural [[dam]] opposite the cirque face along the northeastern shore of the lake, where there an outlet, and the lake is 10 to 15 feet deep (3 to 5 m).<ref name = CLLRS/>

The cirque where Castle Lake is found is a classic [[Northern Hemisphere]] cirque.  The [[headwall|''cirque headwall'']] (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and the part of the mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds.<ref name=GeoA>{{cite book | author = Bowen, Ann, John Pallister, and A.

[[Image:Glacial tarn formation.png|275px|thumb|left|Formation of cirque and resulting [[tarn]].]]
During initial glacial formation, snow changed into glacial ice as this year-round snow pack increased and deepened.  The process of [[nivation]] followed (where a hollow in a slope was enlarged by [[freeze-thaw]] weathering and glacial erosion).<ref name=GeoA/>  As the hollow enlarged and filled with snow and ice, rock debris (or till) contained within the glacial ice also began to [[Abrasion (geology)|abrade]] the [[bedrock]] surface - as the glacial ice moved down the slope, it had a "sandpaper effect" on the bedrock which it scraped.<ref name = form/>

Eventually the hollow took the shape of a large bowl in the side of the mountain, with the headwall being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]]. The basin became deeper (especially at the base of the headwall) as it continued to be eroded by abrasion.<ref name = form/>
 
When the [[Younger Dryas#The end of the Younger Dryas|current warming period]] began, the glacier retreated and finally melted completely.  It left behind a bowl shape, deepest at the base of the headwall where the glacial ice had been the deepest and most abrasive.<ref name=GeoA/>  The bowl shape extended to its northeast edge, where there was a terminal moraine of smaller rocks and debris which had been deposited by the glacier.  When the bowl-shaped crater filled with water, this terminal moraine acted as a natural dam, helping to contain the water in the newly-formed cirque lake.<ref name = form/>

Humans introduced [[fish]] into the lake in the 1930s for [[sport fishing]], including [[Rainbow Trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss''), [[Brook Trout|Brook Char]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis''), and Golden Shiner (''Notemigonus crysoliecas'').<ref name = Fish>[http://castlelake.ucdavis.edu/castle_lake/fish Fish] accessed 2008-01-16.</ref>  The Rainbow Trout is stocked annually by the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] for sport fishing.

Although the lake (at elevation {{convert|5574|ft|m|abbr=on}}) and surrounding area are well below local [[tree line]] (for example, on nearby Mt.

At and in the area below the lake, mixed forests of [[Ponderosa Pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa''), [[Red Fir]] (''Abies Magnifica''), [[White Fir]] (''Abies Concolor''), [[Lodgepole Pine]] (''Pinus Contorda''), [[Incense Cedar]] (''Libocedrus decurrens'') and [[Alder]] can be found.<ref name = flora/><ref name = treegallery>[http://castlelake.ucdavis.edu/index.php?q=gallery&g2_itemId=39 Photo gallery of trees] accessed 2008-01-22.</ref>  Alders play a particularly important role, as Alders establish [[symbiosis|symbioses]] with the [[nitrogen]]-fixing [[Actinobacteria]] (''Frankiella alni''). This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil-soluble [[nitrate]]s which can be utilised by the Alder, and favorably enhances the soil fertility generally.
