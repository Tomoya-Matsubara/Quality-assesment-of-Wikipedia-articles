'''[[Dextromethorphan]]''' or '''DXM''', an [[active ingredient]] found in most [[cough suppressant]] cold medicines, is commonly used as a recreational drug.<ref name="cesar" /> While having almost no [[psychoactive]] effects at medically-recommended doses, dextromethorphan has [[euphoric]], [[hallucinogenic]], and [[dissociative]] properties when administered in doses well above those which are considered therapeutic medically for cough suppression.<ref name="cesar">[http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/dxm.asp Dextromethorphan (DXM) | CESAR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

An online essay first published in 1995, entitled "The DXM FAQ", was possibly the first source of specific scientific details regarding dextromethorphan's potential for recreational use. This may have led to a number of "underground" [[website]]s in existence today, devoted to the topic of dextromethorphan as a recreational drug. 

Due to its recreational use and theft concerns,{{Fact|date=October 2008}} many retailers in the US have moved dextromethorphan-containing products behind the counter so that one must ask a pharmacist to receive them or be 18 years (19 in [[New Jersey|NJ]] and AL) or older to purchase them. Some retailers also give out printed recommendations about the potential for abuse with the purchase of products containing dextromethorphan.

== Classification ==
At high doses, dextromethorphan is classified as a dissociative anesthetic and hallucinogen, similar to the controlled substances [[ketamine]] and [[phencyclidine]] (PCP).<ref name=dea1>[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/dextro_m/dextro_m.htm DEXTROMETHORPHAN (Street Names: DXM, CCC, Triple C, Skittles, Robo, Poor Man<U+2019>s PCP)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Also like those drugs, dextromethorphan is an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].<ref name="webtryp">http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_law3.pdf</ref><ref name="Dxm_Hallucinogen">[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_effects.shtml Erowid DXM Vault : Effects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Dextromethorphan generally does not produce withdrawal symptoms characteristic of [[physical addiction|physically addictive]] substances, but there have been cases of [[psychological addiction]]. <ref>[http://www.drugabusehelp.com/drugs/dxm/ Drug Abuse Help: DXM Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.info-drug-rehab.com/dxm.html :: Cough Syrup and Dextromethorphan (DXM) Addiction and Abuse - Drug Rehab Information ::<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Legality ==
Antitussive preparations containing dextromethorphan are legal to purchase from most pharmacies worldwide. Since dextromethorphan's use as a recreational drug usually involves only the ingestion of large quantities of an over-the-counter medication, no legal distinction currently exists between medical and recreational use, sale, or purchase, though some states, such as Illinois, now require signatures to purchase dextromethorphan medications and limit the purchase to two packages at a time. 

The sale of dextromethorphan in its pure powder form may incur penalties in the United States, although no explicit law exists prohibiting its sale. There have been cases of individuals incurring time in prison and other penalties for selling pure dextromethorphan in this form, due to the incidental breaking of related drug laws <U+2014> such as resale of a medication without proper warning labels.<ref name="webtryp" />

Dextromethorphan was excluded from the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA) of 1970 and was specifically excluded from the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. Dextromethorphan is still excluded from the CSA (as of 2008), however officials have warned that it could still be added if increased abuse warrants its scheduling.<ref name="cesar" />

Dextromethorphan is generally available over the counter in most countries, with three exceptions being Hong Kong, Sweden and Denmark. <ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_law.shtml Erowid DXM Vault : Legal Status<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Effects ==
Dextromethorphan, when consumed in low "recreational doses" (usually around or slightly more than 200 mg, or around 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg), is described as having a euphoric effect. With middle doses (about 400 mg, or 2.5 to 7.5 mg/kg), intense [[euphoria]] (or [[dysphoria]]), vivid imagination, and [[closed-eye hallucination]]s may occur. With high doses (600 mg, or 7.5 mg/kg and over), profound alterations in consciousness have been noted, and users often report out-of-body experiences or temporary psychosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bornstein, S; Czermak, M; Postel, J., |title=Apropos of a case of voluntary medicinal intoxication with dextromethorphan hydrobromide |journal=Annales Medico-Psychologiques |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=1968 |pages=447<U+2013>451}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dodds A, Revai E |title=Toxic psychosis due to dextromethorphan |journal=Med J Aust |year=1967 |volume=2 |pages=231}}</ref> Frequent and long-term usage at very high doses could possibly lead to [[toxic psychosis]] and other permanent psychological problems.<ref name="cesar" />  Most users find such high doses to be extremely uncomfortable and are unwilling to repeat them. [[Flanging]] (speeding up or slowing down) of sensory input is also a characteristic effect of recreational use. 

There may also be a marked difference between dextromethorphan hydrobromide, contained in most cough suppressant preparations, and dextromethorphan polistirex, contained in the brand name preparation Delsym. Polistirex is polymer that is bonded to the dextromethorphan that requires more time for the stomach to digest it as it requires that an [[ion exchange]] reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, dextromethorphan polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of time release pills. As a cough suppressant, the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours, so this duration may also hold true when used recreationally.

In 1981, a paper by Gosselin estimated the lethal dose to be between 50 and 500 mg/kg.  Doses as high as 15-20 mg/kg are taken by some recreational users. It is suggested by a single case study that the antidote to dextromethorphan overdose is [[naloxone]], administered [[intravenously]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schneider SM, Michelson EA, et al. |title=Dextromethorphan poisoning reversed by naloxone |journal=Am. J. Emerg. Med. |year=1991 |volume=9 |pages=237<U+2013>238 |doi=10.1016/0735-6757(91)90085-X}}</ref>

In addition to producing PCP-like mental effects, high doses may cause a false-positive result for PCP and [[opiates]] in some drug tests.<ref name=dea1/> <ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_testing.shtml Erowid DXM Vault : Drug Tests<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Risks associated with use ==
Most risks result from abusing multi-symptom cold medications, rather than using a cough suppressant whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan. Abusing medications with multiple active ingredients can produce negative psychological and physiological effects and is highly unsafe. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as [[acetaminophen]], [[chlorphenamine]], and [[phenylephrine]], any of which can cause permanent bodily damage, or even death, if taken on the generally-accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. However, It is generally accepted within the medical community that doses of Chlorphenamine at or below 1mg/kg to be little cause for concern. The real danger in abusing a preperation which contains both DXM and Chlorphenamine would be that they both utilize the same enzyme in the liver during metabolism. [[Guaifenesin]], an [[expectorant]] commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, while not generally fatal if taken on dextromethorphan's recreational dosing scale, it can cause unpleasant symptoms including [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], and [[headache]].<ref name="kirages">{{cite journal |author=Kirages T, Sul<U+00E9> H, Mycyk M |title=Severe manifestations of coricidin intoxication |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=473<U+2013>5 |year=2003 |pmid=14574654 |doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(03)00168-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kintz, P. and Mangin, P. |title=Toxicological findings in a death involving dextromethorphan and terfenadine |journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol. |year=1992 |month=December |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=351<U+2013>352}}</ref><ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml Erowid DXM Vault : Guide to DXM in Non-Prescription Drugs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Combining dextromethorphan with other substances can compound risks. [[stimulants|CNS stimulants]] such as [[amphetamine]] and/or [[cocaine]] can cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure and heart rate. [[CNS depressant]]s such as [[ethanol|ethanol (drinking alcohol)]] will have a combined depressant effect, which can cause a decreased [[respiration|respiratory]] rate, although it is not clear whether or not those symptoms of such drugs would actually be worse when combined with dextromethorphan. Combining dextromethorphan with other [[CYP2D6#CYP2D6_Ligands|CYP2D6 substrates]] can also cause both drugs to build to dangerous levels in the bloodstream. <ref>[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/PEOPLE/injury/research/job185drugs/dextromethorphan.htm Drugs and Human Performance FACT SHEETS - Dextromethorphan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_side_effects.shtml Erowid DXM Vault : DXM FAQ - Side Effects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== The "DXM FAQ" ==
A document entitled "The DXM FAQ," by [[William E. White]], classifies dextromethorphan's high-dose effects into five [[plateau]]s, each defined by a dosing range. The dosages are specified in ratios of [[milligram]]s (of the drug) per [[kilogram]] (of one's body mass). According to the [[FAQ]], the plateaus occur as follows:<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml Erowid DXM Vault : DXM FAQ - The Experience<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*'''First plateau''': At a dosage of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg, effects include a sensation of alertness, stimulant effects such as restlessness, increased heartbeat, and increased body temperature, intensification of emotions, general euphoria, euphoria linked to music, alteration of sensations of gravity, loss of balance, and slight intoxication.

*'''Second plateau''': At 2.5 to 7.5 mg/kg, effects include the same effects of the first plateau, with added choppy sensory input, entering a dreamlike state of consciousness, increasing detachment from outside world, a heavier "stoned" feeling than with first plateau, and/or closed-eye hallucinations.

*'''Third plateau''': At 7.5 to 15.0 mg/kg, effects include flanging of visual effects, difficulty recognizing people or objects, chaotic blindness, dreamlike vision, inability to comprehend language, abstract hallucinations, delayed reaction time, decision making impairment, feelings of peace and quiet, near complete loss of motor coordination, [[short-term memory]] impairment, and/or feelings of rebirth.

*'''Fourth plateau''': At 15.0 mg/kg or more, an individual may experience a perceived loss of contact and control with their own body, changes in visual perception, out-of-body experiences, perceptions of contact with "superior," [[supernatural]], or other [[archetypal]] beings (ie. [[gods]], [[extraterrestrials|alien]]s, [[vampire]]s, etc.), other miscellaneous delusions, lack of movement or desire to move, rapid heart rate, complete blindness, increased hearing, and intensification of third plateau effects.

*'''Plateau Sigma''': 2.5-7.5 mg/kg every three hours for 9-12 hours; There are some reports that suggest this fifth plateau occurs by ''prolonging'' dosage, rather than increasing it, ingesting small to moderate doses over time. White characterizes Plateau Sigma as bona-fide psychosis, a complete disconnection from reality, with prevalent, realistic, vivid open-eye visual and auditory hallucinations. For example, users have reported entirely realistic and vividly-recalled encounters with aliens and gods. Users have also reported a disconnection from emotion, such that inclinations and urges become auditory hallucinations of vocal commands to which the user is entirely obedient <U+2014> as in, rather than simply feeling tired and sitting down, a user would hear a voice saying, "sit down now, you're tired," and feel inclined to obey. White says that of all the reports of Plateau Sigma experiences he received, over half were described as unpleasant, and users said they were unwilling to repeat the experience.

== Pharmacology ==
Dextromethorphan's hallucinogenic and dissociative effects can be attributed largely to [[dextrorphan]] (DXO), a [[metabolite]] produced when dextromethorphan metabolizes within the body. Both dextrorphan ''and'' dextromethorphan are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s,<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=914417 Cat.Inist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> just like the dissociative hallucinogenic drugs [[ketamine]] and [[phencyclidine]] (PCP); however for that purpose, dextrorphan is more potent than dextromethorphan.<ref>[http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/309/2/515?ijkey=73c6efcf7713b02798c855b5ce4d50f1aa22d299&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha#ABS Comparison of the Effects of Dextromethorphan, Dextrorphan, and Levorphanol on the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis - Pechnick and Poland 309 (2): 515 - Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Just like all NMDA receptor antagonists, dextrorphan and dextromethorpan inhibit a [[neurotransmitter]] called [[glutamate]] from activating [[neurotransmitter receptor|receptor]]s in the brain. This can effectively slow or even shut down certain neural pathways, preventing areas of the brain from communicating with each other. This leaves the user feeling dissociated (disconnected) or potentially "out-of-body."<ref name="Muir KW and Lees KR">{{cite journal | last = Muir | first = KW| authorlink = | coauthors =Lees KR | title =Clinical experience with excitatory amino acid antagonist drugs | journal =Stroke | volume = 26| issue =3 | pages =503<U+2013>513 | publisher = |year=1995 | url =http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/26/3/503 | doi = | id = | accessdate =2007-01-17 | pmid =7886734 }} </ref><ref name="Kristensen ">{{cite journal | last =Kristensen  | first =JD | authorlink = | coauthors =Svensson B, and Gordh T Jr | title =The NMDA-receptor antagonist CPP abolishes neurogenic 'wind-up pain' after intrathecal administration in humans | journal =Pain | volume = 51| issue = 2| pages =249<U+2013>253 | publisher = |year=1992 | url = | doi = | pmid =1484720  | accessdate = }}</ref>

Dextromethorphan's euphoric effects have sometimes been attributed to the triggering of an increase in [[dopamine]] levels, since such an increase generally correlates to a pleasurable response to a drug, as is observed with [[antidepressant]]s. However the effect of dextrorphan and dextromethorphan on dopamine levels is a disputed subject. Studies show that some NMDA receptor antagonists, like ketamine and PCP, do raise dopamine levels.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v7/n8/full/4001093a.html NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and PCP have direct effects on the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2receptorsimplications for models of schizophrenia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="jofns">{{cite journal | author= Verma A, Moghaddam B | title=NMDA receptor antagonists impair prefrontal cortex function as assessed via spatial delayed alternation performance in rats: modulation by dopamine | journal=Journal of Neuroscience | year=1996 |month=January |day=16 |volume=1 |pages=373<U+2013>9}}</ref> Other studies show that [[dizocilpine]], another NMDA receptor antagonist, has no effect on dopamine levels. Some findings even suggest that dextromethorphan actually counters the dopamine increase caused by [[morphine]].<ref name="nhtsa">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/PEOPLE/injury/research/job185drugs/dextromethorphan.htm|title=Dextromethorphan|work=NHTSA}}</ref><ref name="Steinmiller CL et al.">{{cite journal | last =Steinmiller  | first =CL | authorlink = | coauthors = Maisonneuve IM, Glick SD. | title =Effects of dextromethorphan on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens: Interactions with morphine | journal =Pharmacol Biochem Behav. | volume = 74| issue = 4| pages =803<U+2013>10 | publisher =Center for Neuropharmacology and Neuroscience (MC-136) |year=2003 | url = | doi = | pmid =12667894  | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="Carrozza DP et al.">{{cite journal | last =Carrozza  | first =DP | authorlink = | coauthors =Ferraro TN, Golden GT, Reyes PF, Hare TA. | title =In vivo modulation of excitatory amino acid receptors: microdialysis studies on N-methyl-D-aspartate-evoked striatal dopamine release and effects of antagonists | journal =Brain Res. | volume = 74| issue = 4| pages =803<U+2013>10 | publisher = |year=1992 | url = | doi = | pmid =1353403 | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="Huang EY et al.">{{cite journal | last =Huang  | first =EY | authorlink = | coauthors =Liu TC, Tao PL. | title =Co-administration of dextromethorphan with morphine attenuates morphine rewarding effect and related dopamine releases at the nucleus accumbens | journal =Brain Res. | volume = 368| issue = 5| pages =386<U+2013>92 | publisher = |year=2003 | url = | doi = | pmid =14564449 | accessdate = }}</ref> Due to these conflicting results, the actual effect of dextromethorphan on dopamine levels is yet to be determined.
