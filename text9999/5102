The '''Jeremiah Wright controversy''' is an [[United States|American]] [[political]] issue that gained national attention in March 2008 when [[ABC News]], after reviewing dozens of [[United States presidential election, 2008|U.S. 2008 Presidential Election]] candidate [[Barack Obama]]'s pastor [[Jeremiah Wright]]'s sermons,<ref name="abc1"/> excerpted parts which were subject to intense media scrutiny.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Dilanian |title=Defenders say Wright has love, righteous anger for USA |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-03-18-obamawright_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2008-04-02 }}</ref><ref name="adubato-msnbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23745283/|title=Obama's reaction to Wright too little, too late|publisher=MSNBC|date=March 21, 2008|author=Adubato, Steve}}</ref>  Wright is a retired senior pastor of [[Trinity United Church of Christ]] in [[Chicago]] and former pastor of [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]] Barack Obama.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24371827/ |title=Obama Strongly Denounces his ex-Pastor | publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=2008-03-14|accessdate=2008-04-28|first=Alex|last=Johnson}}</ref> Obama denounced the statements in question, but after critics continued to press the issue of his relationship with Wright he gave a speech titled "[[A More Perfect Union (speech)|A More Perfect Union]]," in which he sought to place Dr. Wright's comments in a historical and sociological context.

The controversy began to fade, but was renewed in late April when Wright made a series of media appearances, including an interview on [[Bill Moyers Journal]], a speech at the [[NAACP]] and a speech at the [[National Press Club]].<ref name=autogenerated1>"Listening to Rev.

==Background==
[[Barack Obama]] first met Wright in the late 1980s, while he was working as a [[community organizer]] in [[Chicago]] before attending [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name="brachear1">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-070121-obama-pastor,0,1574186.story |title=Rev.

The title of Obama's 2006 memoir, ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'', was inspired by one of Wright's sermons, which was also a theme of Obama's 2004 [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]] to the Democratic National Convention.<ref name="obama1"/><ref name="brachear1"/><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/27/politics/campaign/27TEXT-OBAMA.htm?pagewanted=3&ei=5070&en=9729413331e5171f&ex=1224475200 <U+201C>Barack Obama's Remarks to the Democratic National Convention<U+201D>], ''New York Times'' ([[2004-07-27]]): <U+201C>The audacity of hope!

Wright was scheduled to give the public [[invocation]] before Obama's presidential announcement, but Obama withdrew the invitation the night before the event.<ref name="kantor1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/us/politics/06obama.html |title=Disinvitation by Obama Is Criticized |accessdate=2008-03-23 |last= Kantor |first= Jodi |date=2007-03-6 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref> Wright wrote a rebuttal letter to the editor disputing the characterization of the account as reported in an article in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tucc.org/upload/tuccbulletin_mar18.pdf |title=Letter to ''The New York Times'' (pdf) |accessdate=2008-03-23 |last=Wright |first=Jeremiah |date=2007-03-11 |publisher=''Trinity United Church of Christ - Bulletin''}}</ref>

==Controversial sermon excerpts==
Most of the controversial excerpts that gained national attention in March 2008 were taken from two sermons: one titled <U+201C>The Day of Jerusalem<U+2019>s Fall<U+201D> delivered on [[September 16]], [[2001]] and another, titled "Confusing God and Government", delivered on [[April 13]], [[2003]].

===<U+201C>The Day of Jerusalem<U+2019>s Fall<U+201D>===
In a sermon delivered shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Wright made comments about an interview of former U.S. Ambassador [[Edward Peck]] he saw on [[Fox News]]. Wright said:

<blockquote>"I heard Ambassador Peck on an interview yesterday. Did anybody else see him or hear him? He was on Fox News. This is a white man, and he was upsetting the Fox News commentators to no end. He pointed out <U+2014> did you see him, John? <U+2014> a white man, he pointed out, ambassador, that what Malcolm X said when he got silenced by Elijah Muhammad was in fact true <U+2014> America's chickens are coming home to roost."<ref>[[Hannity & Colmes]] say that "Peck never used the phrase 'chickens coming home to roost' and that Wright went further in criticizing U.S. policy than Peck did" in Peck's September 15th, 2001 interview on Fox News Channel. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/04/mike_huckabee_on_hannity_colme_1.html Also see partial transcript, with similar observation by PBS Ombudsman: http://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/2008/05/post_13.html</ref></blockquote>

Wright spoke of the United States [[Trail of Tears|taking land from the Indian tribes]] by what he labeled as terror, bombing [[Grenada]], [[Panama]], [[Libya]], [[Hiroshima]], and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and argued that the [[Allegations of state terrorism by the United States|United States supported state terrorism]] against the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] and South Africa. He said that his parishioners' response should be to examine their relationship with God, not go "from the hatred of armed enemies to the hatred of unarmed innocents." His comment (quoting [[Malcolm X]]) that "America's chickens are coming home to roost" was widely interpreted as meaning that America had brought the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] upon itself.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/14/obama.minister/index.html | title = Controversial minister off Obama's campaign | work = cnn.com | accessdate = 2008-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/03/the-wright-post.html |title=The Wright post-9/11 sermon |accessdate=2008-03-25 |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan |date=2008-03-22 |work=Daily Dish |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOdlnzkeoyQ |title=FOX Lies!!

<blockquote>"We bombed Hiroshima, we bombed Nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon, and we never batted an eye... and now we are indignant, because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought back into our own front yards. America's chickens are coming home to roost."</blockquote>

Later, Wright continued :

<blockquote>"Violence begets violence. Hatred begets hatred. And terrorism begets terrorism. A white ambassador said that y'all, not a black militant. Not a reverend who preaches about racism. An ambassador whose eyes are wide open and who is trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised. The ambassador said the people that we have wounded don<U+2019>t have the military capability we have. But they do have individuals who are willing to die and take thousands with them. And we need to come to grips with that."<ref name="Martin">{{cite web |url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/21/the-full-story-behind-rev-jeremiah-wrights-911-sermon/ |title=The full story behind Rev.

===<U+201C>Confusing God and Government<U+201D>===
Clips from a sermon that Wright gave, entitled <U+201C>Confusing God and Government<U+201D>, were also shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]''<ref name="abc1"/> and [[Fox News]]. In the sermon, Wright first makes the distinction between God and governments, and points out that many governments in the past have failed: "Where governments lie, God does not lie. Where governments change, God does not change."<ref name="govt1">{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=RvMbeVQj6Lw|title=Tell the Whole Story FOX! Barack Obama's pastor Wright |accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=Excerpted from [[YouTube]]"}}</ref> Wright then states: 

<blockquote><U+201C>[The United States] government lied about their belief that all men were created equal. The truth is they believed that all white men were created equal. The truth is they did not even believe that white women were created equal, in creation nor civilization. The government had to pass an amendment to the Constitution to get white women the vote. Then the government had to pass an equal rights amendment to get equal protection under the law for women. The government still thinks a woman has no rights over her own body, and between Uncle Clarence who sexually harassed Anita Hill, and a closeted Klan court, that is a throwback to the 19th century, handpicked by Daddy Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, between Clarence and that stacked court, they are about to undo Roe vs. Wade, just like they are about to un-do affirmative action. The government lied in its founding documents and the government is still lying today. Governments lie.<U+201D></blockquote>

He continued:
<blockquote><U+201C>The government lied about Pearl Harbor too. They knew the Japanese were going to attack. Governments lie. The government lied about the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. They wanted that resolution to get us in the Vietnam War. Governments lie. The government lied about Nelson Mandela and our CIA helped put him in prison and keep him there for 27 years. The South African government lied on Nelson Mandela. Governments lie."</blockquote>

Wright then stated: 
<blockquote>"The government lied about the [[Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male|Tuskegee experiment]]. They purposely infected African American men with syphilis. Governments lie. The government lied about bombing Cambodia and Richard Nixon stood in front of the camera, <U+2018>Let me make myself perfectly clear<U+2026><U+2019> Governments lie. The government lied about the drugs for arms Contra scheme orchestrated by Oliver North, and then the government pardoned all the perpetrators so they could get better jobs in the government. Governments lie.... The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color. Governments lie. The government lied about a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein and a connection between 9.11.01 and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Governments lie.<U+201D></blockquote>

He spoke about the government's [[rationale for the Iraq War]]:
<blockquote><U+201C>The government lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq being a threat to the United States peace. And guess what else? If they don<U+2019>t find them some weapons of mass destruction, they gonna do just like the [[Los_Angeles_Police_Department#Controversy|LAPD]], and plant the some weapons of mass destruction. Governments lie.<U+201D></blockquote>

Wright then commented on God and government:
<blockquote>"And the United States of America government, when it came to treating her citizens of Indian descent fairly, she failed. She put them on reservations. When it came to treating her citizens of Japanese descent fairly, she failed. She put them in internment prison camps. When it came to treating her citizens of African descent fairly, America failed. She put them in chains, the government put them on slave quarters, put them on auction blocks, put them in cotton field, put them in inferior schools, put them in substandard housing, put them in scientific experiments, put them in the lowest paying jobs, put them outside the equal protection of the law, kept them out of their racist bastions of higher education and locked them into positions of hopelessness and helplessness. The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing 'God Bless America.' No, no, no, not God Bless America. God damn America <U+2014> that's in the Bible <U+2014> for killing innocent people. God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human.  God damn America, as long as she tries to act like she is God, and she is supreme. The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent.."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/america-obama-wright-1998925-rev-bless|title=Obama's pastor disaster|accessdate=2008-03-25|author=Steyn, Mark|date=[[2008-03-15]]|publisher=[[Orange County Register]]}}</ref><ref name="govt1"/><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88552254 Chicagoans: Reports Misrepresent Obama's Church : NPR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="lie">{{cite web |url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/21/the-full-story-behind-wright<U+2019>s-<U+201C>god-damn-america<U+201D>-sermon/ |title=The Full Story Behind Wright<U+2019>s <U+201C>God Damn America<U+201D> sermon |accessdate=2008-03-25 |last= Martin | first=Roland |date=[[March 21]], 2008 |work=Anderson Cooper 360 |publisher=''[[CNN]]''}}</ref></blockquote>

==Reaction==
===Barack Obama===
When Wright's comments were aired in the national media, Obama distanced himself from them, saying to [[Charles Gibson]] of ABC News, "It's as if we took the five dumbest things that I've ever said or you've ever said in our lives and compressed them and put them out there <U+2014> I think that people's reaction would, understandably, be upset."<ref>"ABC's Charles Gibson Talks to Barack Obama". ''ABC News''. March 28 2008.</ref> At the same time, Obama stated that "words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it's on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue."<ref>Obama, Barack, "On my Faith and My Church". ''Huffington Post'', March 14 2008.

Obama first denied that he had ever heard Pastor Wright's controversial comments before.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/14/obama.minister/ |title=Controversial minister off Obama's campaign |date=March 15 2008| accessdate=2008-05-03 |publisher=CNN}}</ref> The Illinois Senator later admitted, "Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church?

Many critics found this response inadequate; [[Mark Steyn]], writing in the conservative publication ''[[National Review]]'', stated: "Reverend Wright['s] appeals to racial bitterness are supposed to be everything President Obama will transcend. Right now, it sounds more like the same-old same-old."<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Steyn |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjE3NDc3YTU0ZGM5NGEzZTdkNjcyZjBiNDVjMjU5MGQ= |title=Uncle Jeremiah |work=National Review |date=March 15 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref>

On March 18, in the wake of the controversy, Obama delivered a speech entitled "[[A More Perfect Union (speech)|A More Perfect Union]]" at the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. During the course of the 37-minute speech, Obama spoke of the divisions formed through generations through [[slavery]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and [[Jim Crow laws]], and the reasons for the kinds of discussions and rhetoric used among blacks and whites in their own communities. While condemning the remarks by the pastor, he sought to place them in historical context by describing some of the key events that have formed Wright's views on race-related matters in America. Obama did not disown Wright, whom he has labeled as "an old uncle", as akin to disowning the black community or disowning his white grandmother, [[Madelyn Dunham]].<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0319/p25s01-uspo.html Remarks by Barack Obama: 'A More Perfect Union'] Christian Science Monitor, March 18 2008</ref> The speech was generally well received.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mr. Obama<U+2019>s Profile in Courage |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/opinion/19wed1.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=March 19 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> Obama said that some of the comments by his pastor reminded him of what he called America's "tragic history when it comes to race."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/15/obama-decries-forces-of-division/ |title=Obama decries 'forces of division' |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref> 
===Other Presidential candidates===
In an interview with the editorial board of the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' on [[March 25]], [[2008]], Hillary Clinton commented on Obama's attendance at Trinity United Church of Christ, stating, "You don't choose your family, but you choose what church you want to attend." Later the same day, during a press conference, Clinton spoke on her personal preference in a pastor: "I think given all we have heard and seen, [Wright] would not have been my pastor." A spokesperson for the Obama campaign asserted that Clinton's comments were part of a "transparent effort to distract attention away from the story she made up about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia" the prior week.<ref>{{cite news |coauthors=Alex Mooney and Peter Hamby |title=Clinton: Wright would not have been my pastor |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/25/clinton.wright/ |publisher=CNN |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2008-04-08 }}</ref> Weeks later during the Pennsylvania debate in [[Philadelphia]], Clinton said, "For Pastor Wright to have given his first sermon after 9/11 and to have blamed the United States for the attack, which happened in my city of New York, would have been just intolerable for me."<ref name="harden-uktelegraph">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/17/wuspolls117.xml|title=Barack Obama stumbles in hostile TV debate

Future Republican nominee [[John McCain]] defended Obama when it came to allegations of [[guilt by association]], saying, "I think that when people support you, it doesn't mean that you support everything they say. Obviously, those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with, and I don't believe that Senator Obama would support any of those, as well."<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=McCain |authorlink=John McCain |coauthors=[[Sean Hannity]] |title=Exclusive: John McCain Sits Down With Sean Hannity |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,337834,00.html |work=[[Hannity & Colmes]] |publisher=[[FOX News]] |date=[[2008-03-14]] |accessdate=2008-03-26 }}</ref>

===Government officials===
Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] weighed in on the Wright matter on [[April 10]], [[2008]]. He appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show and said, "I thought some of the things he said were absolutely appalling... I haven't gotten into the business of trying to judge how Sen. Obama dealt with it, or didn't deal with it, but I think, like most Americans, I was stunned at what the reverend was preaching in his church and then putting up on his Web site."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/04/cheney-calls-re.html|title=Cheney Calls the Rev.

[[Lawrence Korb]], Director of National Security Studies at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and former assistant [[Secretary of Defense]] in the administration of [[Ronald Reagan]] defended Wright's military service, stating, "We've seen on television, in a seemingly endless loop, sound bites of a select few of Rev. Wright's many sermons. Some of the Wright's comments are inexcusable and inappropriate and should be condemned, but in calling him 'unpatriotic,' let us not forget that this is a man who gave up six of the most productive years of his life to serve his country... he has demonstrated his patriotism."<ref>Korb, Lawrence and Ian Moss.

===Media===
====Commentators and pundits====
Conservative radio talk show and television host [[Sean Hannity]] expressed shock and anger when hearing the comments, saying, "First of all, I will not let up on this issue.

[[Salon.com]] editor-in-chief [[Joan Walsh]] wrote, "the whole idea that Wright has been attacked over 'sound bites,' and if Americans saw his entire sermons, in context, they'd feel differently, now seems ludicrous. The long clips Moyers played only confirm what was broadcast in the snippets..." and notes, "My conclusion Friday night was bolstered by new tapes of Wright that came out this weekend, including one that captures him saying the Iraq war is 'the same thing al-Qaida is doing under a different color flag,' and a much longer excerpt from the 'God damn America' sermon that denounces 'Condoskeezer Rice...'".<ref>[http://www.salon.com/opinion/walsh/election_2008/2008/04/27/wright_moyers/index.html Why Jeremiah Wright is so wrong - Joan Walsh - Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Fox News' [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] said of Wright, "In my opinion, Rev. Jeremiah Wright is not an honest man.

Democratic strategist [[Flavia Colgan]] asserted that Obama was not always in church and that the several minutes of [[soundbites]] continually played by the media do not equate to twenty years. Colgan also argued that had the media been able to find additional controversial statements beyond the ones they played, they would have played them as well.<ref>Anderson Cooper 360, 29 April 2008.</ref>{{Verify source|date=May 2008}}

=====Commentary on media coverage=====
The controversy sparked continuous media coverage, on both national media outlets and local sources. More than 3,000 news stories had been written on the issue by early April.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Moyers |url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04252008/profile.html |title=Bill Moyer's Journal:Jeremiah Wright |publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref>

Wright's church, [[Trinity United Church of Christ, Chicago|Trinity United Church of Christ]], criticized the media coverage of his past sermons, saying in a statement that Wright's "character is being assassinated in the public sphere.... It is an indictment on Dr. Wright<U+2019>s ministerial legacy to present his global ministry within a 15- or 30-second sound bite."<ref>Trapper, Jake. "Obama's Church Blames Media".

Lara Cohen, news director at the ''[[Us Weekly]]'', noted that her publication "has been accused of distracting people from the 'Important Issues'" because of its focus on [[Supermarket tabloid]] concerns, and said that mainstream media "talking heads love to tut-tut about how attention to celebrity gossip is causing the great dumbing-down of American society." She charged that, in light of the sensationalized coverage about Wright, mainstream media outlets no longer had grounds to make these criticisms of ''Us Weekly'', and turned the charge back upon the mainstream media.  Cohen state, "The true hallmark of sensationalized journalism is ginning up controversy to drive sales, and for the mainstream news media Wright was a tailor-made tabloid icon. With newspaper sales at record lows, network news ratings tanking and 24-hour news channels desperate to fill up all 24 hours, Wright's outbursts were the mainstream media's equivalent of Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch&mdash;a train wreck no one could turn away from.

Republican commentator and former [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff member Lt. Col. [[Oliver North]] (whom Wright mentioned in his controversial comments) said of the controversy's media coverage, "Rather than serving up more blather about Jeremiah Wright, editors, producers and program directors would better serve us all by sending their commentators and correspondents out to cover those who have volunteered to serve in our [[United States military|military]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,353763,00.html|title=All the Wright Stuff|date=May 1, 2008|accessdate=2008-05-04|publisher=Fox News|author=North, Oliver}}</ref>

===Trinity United Church of Christ members===
Lisa Miller in ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that, before the political controversy erupted, "Trinity was already in the throes of a difficult generational transition."  After the period of Wright's speaking engagements before national audiences, Miller describes how "the reaction was anguish and anger" among church members and that three basic factions developed among them: those who wished Wright would not speak anymore, those who believed in what he said, and those who just wished the whole controversy would go away.<ref>Newsweek, May 19, 2008</ref>

===Academia===
Many academics commented on Wright, [[black theology]], and the concomitant political controversy within a broader context of American history and culture.

In 2004, prior to the Wright controversy, Anthony E. Cook, a professor of law at [[Georgetown University]], provided a detailed comparative analysis of sermons delivered after 9-11 by [[Jerry Falwell]], [[T.D. Jakes]] and Jeremiah Wright. Cook noted that the overall intent of Falwell's and Jakes's sermons was to use the Christian religion as a justification for the [[War on Terror]], while Wright's overall intent was to side against war and to get listeners to engage in introspection about their daily behavior and relationship with God.<ref>Anthony E. Cook, "Encountering the Other: Evangelicalism and Terrorism in a Post 911 World". ''Journal of Law and Religion'', Vol. 20, No. 1, (2004 - 2005), pp. 1-30. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4144682 Available with subscription at JSTOR.]</ref>

After the political controversy erupted, [[Georgetown University]] [[sociology]] professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] stated, "[[Patriotism]] is the affirmation of one's country in light of its best values, including the attempt to correct it when it's in error. Wright's words are the tough love of a war-tested patriot speaking his mind."<ref>Michael Eric Dyson, "Understanding Black Patriotism." ''TIME Magazine, Thursday, Apr. 24, 2008.

Marty also argued that Trinity's Africentrism "should not be more offensive than that synagogues should be 'Judeo-centric' or that Chicago's Irish parishes be 'Celtic-centric'."<ref>Marty, Martin E.

Bill J. Leonard, Dean of the divinity school and professor of church history at [[Wake Forest University]], argued that Wright "was standing and speaking out of the [[jeremiad]] tradition or preaching in the U.S.," which he said "dates back to the Puritans" and that both "black and white ministers have used since the 1600s in this country." Leonard explains that the jeremiad tradition dealt with woe and promise and moral failure not only in the church but in the nation."<ref name=autogenerated1 />  James B. Bennett of [[Santa Clara University]], says [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] shared similar feelings with Wright concerning some U.S. activities, quoting King as saying, "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today <U+2014> my own government," and that "America was founded on genocide, and a nation that is founded on genocide is destructive."<ref>{{cite news |first=James B. |last=Bennett | title=Obama's pastor's words ring uncomfortably true |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5WcldcmR8 |publisher=''San Jose Mercury News'', |date=20 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-04-02-dyson-mlk_N.htm | title = Professor checks out "new landscape" after King | work = USA Today | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}</ref>

This is nothing more than an updated version of the pseudo-science once used to defend segregation in the [[Jim Crow]] South," and "clearly, Rev.

The Rev.

On [[April 27]], Wright gave a keynote address at a fundraising dinner for the [[Detroit]]-chapter of the [[NAACP]].

In his speech to the NAACP, Wright speculated that, "Africans have a different meter, and Africans have a different tonality. Europeans have seven tones, Africans have five.

===Obama's response===<!--This section header is used as a link in [[A More Perfect Union (speech)|A More Perfect Union]]; if the header is changed, please change the link as well.-->
Obama attempted to further distance himself from Wright, as he expressed outrage and shock at a press conference on April 29:

<blockquote> "I am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday... The person that I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago. His comments were not only divisive and destructive, but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate, and I believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church. They certainly don<U+2019>t portray accurately my values and beliefs. And if Reverend Wright thinks that that<U+2019>s political posturing, as he put it, then he doesn<U+2019>t know me very well. And based on his remarks yesterday, well, I may not know him as well as I thought either.... What became clear to me is that he was presenting a world view that contradicts who I am and what I stand for, and what I think particularly angered me was his suggestion somehow that my previous denunciation of his remarks were somehow political posturing. Anybody who knows me and anybody who knows what I'm about knows that I am about trying to bridge gaps and I see the commonality in all people. ...[A]fter seeing Reverend Wright<U+2019>s performance, I felt as if there was a complete disregard for what the American people are going through and the need for them to rally together to solve these problems. ...[W]hatever relationship I had with Reverend Wright has changed, as a consequence of this."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Zeleny |title=Obama Says He<U+2019>s Outraged by Ex-Pastor<U+2019>s Comments |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/obama-says-hes-outraged-by-ex-pastors-comments/index.html?hp |publisher=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Barack |last=Obama |authorlink=Barack Obama |title=Transcript: Obama Press Conference on Jeremiah Wright |url=http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/04/29/transcript-obama-press-conference-on-jeremiah-wright/ |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2008-05-04 }}</ref></blockquote>

==== Reaction ====
Obama's second statement on the controversy elicited a range of responses. Noam Scheiber of the [[New Republic]], wrote, "I thought Obama put the distance he needed to between himself and Wright just now...The other lingering question is whether people will wonder all over again how Obama could have been friends with this guy for 20 years. It's a legitimate concern, but if it didn't weigh him down too much after the Philadelphia speech in March, I wouldn't expect it to do him in this time.

{{wikinews|Obama withdraws from Trinity United Church}}
On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in [[Trinity United Church of Christ]], where Wright had previously served as senior pastor, stating that <U+201C>Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views<U+201D>.<ref name="resign"/><ref>[http://www.tucc.org/pastoral_staff.htm Trinity United Church of Christ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Later impact and continuing controversy===
Wright stated in a June 10, 2009 interview that he had still voted for Obama for President, despite the controversy. He said that he had no regrets about any of his comments. He also alleged that "them [''sic''] [[Jewish-Americans|Jews]]" within the [[Obama administration]] are preventing the two from speaking to each other. He also suggested that Obama did not send a delegation to the [[Durban Review Conference]] in [[Geneva]], a conference partially dedicated to promoting [[antisemitism]] according to the ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'',<ref name=jta/> because of Jewish pressure, saying: "[T]he Jewish vote, the [[AIPAC|A-I-P-A-C]] vote, that<U+2019>s controlling him, that would not let him send representation to the Darfur Review Conference, that<U+2019>s talking this craziness on this trip, cause they<U+2019>re Zionists, they would not let him talk to someone who calls a spade what it is."<ref name=them>{{cite news|title=Rev.

Wright modified his statements the next day, saying that "I<U+2019>m not talking about all Jews, all people of the Jewish faith, I<U+2019>m talking about Zionists." He also endorsed the [[anti-Zionist]] books ''[[Marc_H._Ellis#Publications|Judaism Does Not Equal Israel]]'' by [[Marc H.

Wright wrote on his [[Facebook]] page apologizing for his remarks on June 12. He wrote, "I mis-spoke and I sincerely meant no harm or ill-will to the American Jewish community or the Obama administration... I have great respect for the Jewish faith and the foundational (and central) part of our Judeo-Christian tradition." He also stated, "I love President Obama as my son, and support and honor him as the President of the United States of America and leader of the free world."<ref name=sweet/> Reverend Amos Brown, a former [[San Francisco supervisor]] and pastor of the [[Third Baptist Church]], has defended Wright and disputed charges of [[anti-Semitism]]. He said, "[p]eople hear snippets of things and they go running with it rather than sitting down and having a dialogue, the way Jesus engaged people".<ref>{{cite news|first=Carla|last=Marinucci|title=Rev.

==Opinion polling==
In mid-March, a [[Rasmussen Reports]] national telephone poll of voters found that just 8% had a favorable opinion of Jeremiah Wright and 58% had an unfavorable view. 73% of voters believed that Wright<U+2019>s comments were divisive, while 29% of African-Americans said Wright<U+2019>s comments made them more likely to support Obama. 66% of those polled had read, seen, or heard news stories about Wright<U+2019>s comments.<ref name="rasumussen march">[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/people2/just_8_have_favorable_opinion_of_pastor_jeremiah_wright Just 8% Have Favorable Opinion of Pastor Jeremiah Wright].

During these events, Clinton briefly took the lead in the [[Gallup]] national tracking poll, ahead of Obama by 7 points on [[March 18]]. By [[March 20]], Clinton's lead decreased to 2 points, a [[statistical significance|statistically insignificant]] amount. The same day, [[John McCain]] took a 3 point lead over both Democratic candidates in [[hypothetical]] General Election match ups, with a 2 point margin of error.<ref>Lydia Saad.

A CBS poll taken from March 15 to March 17 found that sixty-five percent of registered voters said it made no difference in their view of Obama, while thirty percent said it made them have a less favorable view.<ref>{{cite news | work=CBS | date=[[March 18]], [[2008]] | accessdate=2008-03-31 | title=CBS Poll: Pastor's Remarks Hurt Obama | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/18/opinion/polls/main3948010.shtml}}</ref>

At the end of March 2008, as over 40 states had already held their Democratic primary processes, Barack Obama built on his national [[Gallup]] daily tracking poll results to become the first candidate to open a double-digit lead since Super Tuesday, when his competitor Hillary Clinton had a similar margin. On [[March 30]] the poll showed Obama at 52% and Clinton at 42%. The Rassmussen Reports poll, taken during the same time frame, showed an Obama advantage of five points.<ref> {{cite web | url= http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2008/03/gallup-obama--1.html | title = Gallup: Obama has 10-point lead over Clinton -- largest this year | work = USA Today | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}</ref> These polls followed weeks of heavy campaigning and heated rhetoric from both camps, and another late-March poll found Obama maintaining his positive rating and limiting his negative rating, better than his chief rival Clinton, even considering Obama's involvement in controversy during the period. The [[NBC News]] and [[Wall Street Journal]] poll showed Obama losing two points of positive rating and gaining four points of negative rating, while Clinton lost eight points of positive rating and gained five points of negative rating.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB120657171729866843-8cJolllJIL0b0_Tbt4nHsgn6pLw_20080426.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top | title = Democrats are tied in new poll | work = Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}</ref>

Following the revival of the controversy surrounding Wright in late April 2008, several polls showed that Obama's image among voters had suffered.<ref name="gallup-may1">{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/106945/Gallup-Daily-Clinton-49-Obama-45.aspx|title=May 1, 2008|accessdate=2008-05-02|publisher=Gallup, Inc|title=Gallup Daily: Clinton 49%, Obama 45%}}</ref> According to a poll taken by the [[Gallup Organization]], Obama's nationwide favorable rating dropped from 50% to 45% while his challenger for the nomination, Hillary Clinton's, rating rose to 49%.<ref name="gallup-may1"/> In this poll, McCain edged Obama by four percentage points in general election match ups, while Clinton was tied with McCain.<ref name="gallup-may1"/> As of May 5, a Gallup poll of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters showed Obama with a 5% lead over Clinton for the Democratic nomination.<ref name="gallup-may5">{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107014/Gallup-Daily-Democrats-Tied-Record-12th-Day.aspx|title=Gallup Daily: Democrats Tied for Record 12th Day|accessdate=2008-05-02|publisher=Gallup, Inc}}</ref>

In poll data released [[3 May]] [[2008]] from the ''New York Times'' and ''CBS News'', Obama's favorable/unfavorable rating among white Democrats remained the same from last summer. During the same period, Hillary Clinton's unfavorable rating among black Democrats increased by 36 percentage points. The ''Times'' theorized that the opinion shift among blacks was due to tactics of the Clinton campaign labelled 'racially tinged' by many vocal elements within the media, including the alleged 'amplifying' by Hillary Clinton of the Wright affair at numerous times.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/03/opinion/03blow.html?_r=1&oref=slogin A Blacklash? - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Comparisons with other candidates ==
Several commentators have drawn comparisons between the media's treatment of Barack Obama and Jeremiah Wright with the treatment of political candidates who ally themselves with white religious leaders who have made controversial statements.<ref name="Greenwald">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/02/28/hagee/index.html |title=Some hateful, radical minsters <U+2014> white evangelicals <U+2014> are acceptable |accessdate=2008-05-05 |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn Greenwald |date=2008-02-28 |publisher=[[Salon.com]] }}</ref><ref name="Uygur">{{cite news |first=Cenk |last=Uygur |authorlink=Cenk Uygur |title=Different Standards for Black and White Preachers |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cenk-uygur/different-standards-for-b_b_92337.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2008-05-05 }}</ref><ref name="Dionne">{{cite news |first=E.
