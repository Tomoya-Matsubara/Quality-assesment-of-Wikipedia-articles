The '''Nashville Sounds''' are a [[minor league baseball]] team of the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) and are the [[Minor league baseball#AAA|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. They are located in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and are named for the city's association with the [[music industry]]. The team plays their home games at [[Herschel Greer Stadium]], which opened in 1978 and holds 10,052&nbsp;fans as of 2008.

Established as a [[Minor league baseball#AA|Double-A]] team in 1978, the Sounds moved up to the Triple-A level in 1985. The team has served as a [[farm club]] for six major league franchises. A total of 21&nbsp;[[manager (baseball)|managers]] have helmed the club and its nearly 800&nbsp;players. As of the completion of the 2007 season, the team has played in 4,297&nbsp;regular season games and compiled a win<U+2013>loss record of 2,245<U+2013>2,052.<ref>"Year-By-Year Results." ''Nashville Sounds 2008 Media Guide''. 2008: 143.</ref>

The team fielded in 1980 was recognized as one of the 100&nbsp;greatest minor league teams of all time.<ref name=100greatest/> The 2006 team tied the record for the longest game in PCL history. Of the three nine-inning perfect games in the history of the PCL, two have been pitched by members of the Sounds.<ref name=PerfectParra/>

The Sounds won the PCL Championship in 2005, sweeping the [[Tacoma Rainiers]] in three games in the final series. Previous league titles won by the team are the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] title in 1979, as the Double-A affiliate of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], and again in 1982 as the Double-A affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]]. Going into 2008, they were the three-time defending PCL American North Division champions.

== Team history ==
=== Reds era (1978<U+2013>1979) ===
Nashville's professional baseball history dates back to 1885, beginning with the [[Nashville Americans]]. They were followed by the [[Nashville Blues|Blues]], [[Nashville Tigers|Tigers]], [[Nashville Seraphs|Seraphs]], and [[Nashville Vols|Vols]]. The city was without a professional baseball team for 14 years after the [[Minor league baseball#AA|Double-A]] Vols ceased operations after their 1963 season. In 1978, the Nashville Sounds were added as an expansion franchise team in the Double-A [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] and were affiliated with the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

President and part owner [[Larry Schmittou]], head coach of the [[Vanderbilt University]] baseball team, was instrumental in bringing professional baseball back to Nashville. Schmittou's business philosophy revolved around earning profits not from ticket sales, but from the sale of souvenirs and concessions.<ref>Pratt, Kristin.

The club played their home games at a new facility, [[Herschel Greer Stadium]], located south of downtown Nashville at the foot of St. Cloud Hill in [[Fort Negley|Fort Negley Park]]. Fans responded well to the return of baseball to the city, evidenced by Nashville leading the Southern League in attendance in each of their seven seasons as a member of the league.<ref name=Nipper101/> In 1980, it set the all-time league attendance record (575,676).<ref name=100greatest/> The team's name, logo, and color scheme originated with the [[Memphis Sounds]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA), who used them for one season in 1974 before the team relocated and became the [[Baltimore Claws]]. When the ABA merged with the [[National Basketball Association]] in 1976, some of the copyrights were allowed to lapse, and Nashville's baseball team adopted the abandoned schemes.<ref>Ruble, Drew. [http://businesstn.com/content/vestige-empire "Vestige of Empire."] ''Business Tennessee''. July 2006. Retrieved on 1 August 2008.</ref> The color blue was added to Memphis' red and white palate. The team<U+2019>s logo, which was used from 1978 to 1997, reflects the city's association with the [[country music]] industry. It depicts a mustachioed baseball player swinging at a [[baseball (ball)|baseball]] with a guitar, a staple of country music, in place of a [[baseball bat|bat]]. Further illustrating the city<U+2019>s musical ties is the typeface, with letters resembling [[note|music notes]], used to display the team name.

The Sounds played their first home game, a 12<U+2013>4&nbsp;victory, on April 26, 1978 against the [[Mississippi Braves|Savannah Braves]] in front of a sellout crowd of 8,156&nbsp;fans.<ref>Traughber, Bill.

Under manager [[George Scherger]], the Sounds started the 1979 season poorly, before rallying to win 20 of 31&nbsp;games in late May and June. They entered the last game of the first half in first place, but lost to their cross-state rivals, the [[Memphis Chicks]] and finished in second place. The Sounds and Chicks met again on the last day of the second half in a split [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]; both games were won by Nashville. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series two games to one before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the [[Carolina Mudcats|Columbus Astros]]. Nashville captured the league title by defeating the Astros three games to one. Also in 1979, the team played host to the Southern League All-Star Game. The contest pitted a team of the league's all-stars against the major league [[Atlanta Braves]]. The all-stars defeated the Braves, five [[run (baseball)|runs]] to two. Nashville's [[Duane Walker]] was named the MVP.<ref name=SLasg>Elliott, Jeff.

Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville to use a [[designated hitter]] in their lineup. However, this allowance was later revoked, as the Reds were a part of the [[National League]] which did not use a DH. President Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let them use the DH, they would not renew their contract and would look for a new major league affiliate. The Reds did not renege on their decision to prohibit the DH, so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate.<ref name=CSTV/>

=== Yankees era (1980<U+2013>1984) ===
The Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming a part of the [[New York Yankees]] organization. Managers [[Stump Merrill]] and [[Johnny Oates]] and future major leaguers such as [[Steve Balboni]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Buck Showalter]], [[Otis Nixon]], [[Willie McGee]], [[Pat Tabler]], and [[Dan Pasqua]] helped lead Nashville to first or second-place divisional finishes from 1980 to 1984.

The 1980 Sounds finished the first half of the season one-and-a-half games behind the [[Memphis Chicks]]. In the second half, the team finished in first-place, fourteen games ahead of the second-place team. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in [[Earned run average|ERA]] and [[strikeout]]s, and Steve Balboni led the league in [[run (baseball)|runs]], [[home run]]s, and [[total bases]].<ref name=100greatest/> The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676&nbsp;fans visited Greer Stadium.<ref name=100greatest/> As of the completion of the 2007 season, this record still stands. In 2001, the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.<ref name=100greatest>Weiss, Bill and Marshall Wright.

On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made a stop in Nashville to play an exhibition game against the Sounds.

Don Mattingly and Willie McGee, who both played for the Sounds in 1981, were later promoted to the major leagues.

The following year, second half winner Nashville met the [[Tennessee Smokies|Knoxville Blue Jays]] in the 1982 division playoffs. After defeating the Blue Jays, the Sounds advanced to the league championship series to play against the [[Jacksonville Suns]]. Nashville defeated the Suns, three games to one, clinching the Southern League championship, giving the franchise their second league title.<ref>[http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/about/page.jsp?ymd=20070221&content_id=180329&vkey=about_l111&fext=.jsp&sid=l111 "Southern League Champions."] Minor League Baseball. 2008.

The New York Yankees returned for another exhibition game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. New York had a four-run lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning, but a five-run rally with two outs propelled the Sounds to a 5<U+2013>4&nbsp;win in front of 13,641 fans.<ref name=NYYexhib2>Rogers, Ricky.

The Sounds were one game shy of winning the first half pennant in 1984. Winning the first half title is something that eluded the team during its entire seven year span at the Double-A level. Nashville captured the second half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating Knoxville in a playoff game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but Knoxville emerged the victor, ending the Sounds' season. One important highlight of the first half of 1984 took place on May 4, when [[Jim Deshaies]] pitched the club<U+2019>s first [[no-hitter]] against the [[Carolina Mudcats|Columbus Astros]] in the second game of a seven-inning [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]. The 5<U+2013>1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three [[Base on balls|walks]] and a batter being [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]], advancing the runner home for the only Astros [[run (baseball)|run]] of the game.<ref name=NashvilleNoHitters>Traughber, Bill.

=== Tigers era (1985<U+2013>1986) ===
In 1983, Sounds President [[Larry Schmittou]] noticed a 5%&nbsp;drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, and a slight decline in overall attendance.<ref name=1985MftP/> These issues with spectator turnout were accompanied by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a [[Minor league baseball#AAA|Triple-A]] franchise late in the 1983 season. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.<ref name=1985MftP>Schmittou, Larry. "Message from the President." ''The Nashville Sounds 1985 Souvenir Program''. 1985: 8.</ref>

Schmittou and team owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to purchase the [[Evansville Triplets]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]], with plans to move the franchise from [[Evansville, Indiana]], to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order to prove to the team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a [[Minor league baseball#AA|Double-A]] team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation.<ref name=1985MftP/> Nashville<U+2019>s existing [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] franchise was moved to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], where it became the [[Huntsville Stars]]. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the team was moved to Nashville. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded it.

The Sounds entered the Triple-A playing level as affiliates of the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1985. On July 17, [[Bryan Kelly (baseball)|Bryan Kelly]] pitched the club<U+2019>s second [[no-hitter]] against the [[Oklahoma RedHawks|Oklahoma City 89ers]], a 6<U+2013>0&nbsp;win.<ref name=NashvilleNoHitters/> Nashville ended the season in second-place in the Eastern Division, missing out on finishing in first-place by two and a half games.<ref>[http://minors.sabrwebs.com/cgi-bin/league.php?league=10116 "1985 American Association."] The Society for American Baseball Research.

Also that season, the Sounds were enlisted to serve as the competition in the Southern League All-Star Game, held in Huntsville, Alabama. The game was won by Nashville with a score of four runs to two.<ref name=SLasg/>

=== Reds era, part II (1987<U+2013>1992) ===
The Sounds rejoined the [[Cincinnati Reds]] farm system in 1987, this time as their Triple-A affiliate. As a result, a number of minor leaguers played in the Reds organization at two different levels with Nashville. Spending the beginning of the 1987 season around the top of the standings, the team hit a slump after losing a few key players mid-season. The result was a 64<U+2013>76 record and a last place finish.<ref>[http://minors.sabrwebs.com/cgi-bin/league.php?league=10118 "1987 American Association."] The Society for American Baseball Research.

The 1988 Sounds were in last-place and had a losing record until making numerous management changes late in the season. During a two-week period in July and August 1988, the Sounds went through five different managers. The team started the season with [[Jack Lind]], who left due to health problems.<ref name=1988managers/> His position was filled on an interim basis by pitching coach [[Wayne Garland]] until former manager [[George Scherger]], manager of the 1979 Southern League championship Sounds, was brought in.

The Sounds shared their ballpark with the Southern League's [[Nashville Xpress]], previously known as the [[Charlotte Knights]], during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. This came about when Charlotte acquired a Triple-A expansion franchise in 1993, leaving the city's Double-A team without a home. Sounds owner [[Larry Schmittou]] offered Greer Stadium as a temporary home for the team. In order to accommodate an additional team at Greer, the Xpress scheduled its home games during the Sounds<U+2019> road trips.

The Sounds' current, and only, ballpark is [[Herschel Greer Stadium]]. The venue has experienced numerous expansions and contractions since its completion in 1978.

In recent years, following the construction of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer has fallen below standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball. It has been the subject of many renovations and upgrades in order to meet current Triple-A standards. Prior to the 2008 season, more than [[United States dollar|US$]]1&nbsp;million in upgrades and repairs were made to the stadium.<ref name=2008opening>"Sounds cover all the bases to ready ballpark for opener."

=== Past ===
Originally, the team<U+2019>s color scheme consisted of red, white, and blue. Uniforms utilizing this palate were worn from 1978 to 1998. During this time, the team wore two major styles of uniforms: pullover jerseys and button up jerseys. Each of these styles experienced a number of minor design alterations from season to season.

The pullover v-neck jerseys, worn by the team from 1978 to 1986, were made of white fabric, for home games, and red or blue, for road games or as alternates. They carried bands of red, white, and blue around the neck, with larger bands at the end of the sleeves (the blue version had one thin white band and two large red bands). The team<U+2019>s pants were white and also displayed these stripes along the sides (small stripes) and at the waistband (large stripes). The word "Sounds" was written across the chest in two-color music note-like script. Numbers were sewn on the back of jerseys.<ref>Nipper, Skip. ''Baseball in Nashville''. Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2007: 106. ISBN 978-0-7385-4391-8</ref> Beginning circa 1985, numbers were also located on the front of jerseys on the player<U+2019>s left chest, below the team name.<ref name=Nipper111>Nipper, Skip.

From 1987 to 1998, the team<U+2019>s uniforms featured button up jerseys made of white fabric, for home games, and gray, for road games. Small bands of red, white, and blue appeared at the openings of the sleeves and along the sides of the team<U+2019>s pants.

== Mascots ==
[[Image:Nashville Sounds Mascot Ozzie.jpg|thumb|right|Ozzie, mascot of the Nashville Sounds]]
The Nashville Sounds' [[mascot]] is an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cougar named Ozzie. He has yellow fur and wears the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. In addition to the team's current home and alternate uniforms, he also wears versions of their home uniforms from the past few seasons.

The first Sounds mascot was introduced during the team's inaugural 1978 season. Homer Horsehide, whose name was selected in a naming contest, resembled their major league affiliate's mascot<U+2014>[[Mr. Red]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. The character was human in appearance, with the exception of an oversized anthropomorphized baseball in place of a human head. The mustachioed mascot donned a uniform identical to that of Sounds players.<ref>Empson, Frank.

Retrieved on 11 April 2008.</ref>

Prior to Ozzie, a lime-green dinosaur named Champ was the team's mascot.<ref>Wade, Susan.

Retrieved on 25 October 2007.</ref> His short-lived time as a mascot began and ended in 1996. Following altercations with team management and league personnel during games, Champ, vis-<U+00E0>-vis his performer, did not return for the 1997 season.<ref>Hart, Joe. [http://www.citypaper.net/articles/112901/cs.cover1.shtml "Once a Bird Brain..."] ''Philadelphia City Paper''. 29 November 2001. Retrieved on 29 January 2008.</ref>

When Amerisports Companies LLC, the current ownership group, took control of the team in April 1997, they decided that a new mascot was needed. Since the group also owned the [[Minor league baseball#.22Low.22 A|Class A]] [[Kane County Cougars]] minor league team, which had an extra mascot uniform, the surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville. After building a fan following during Ozzie<U+2019>s first season, team management decided to make him the permanent team mascot.<ref>"Sounds GM hates aging ballpark but loves market." ''The Tennessean''. 5 August 2007: 1-2E.</ref> Initially, the Ozzie costume was identical to the brown cougar costume still in use by Kane County, but was later replaced by the current yellow outfit in 1998.

== Faith Nights ==

In addition to promotions that are synonymous with minor league baseball like theme nights, fireworks night, and discounted ticket or concessions night, the Nashville Sounds also host what is called Faith Night. In 2002, the Sounds became the first sports team to host Faith Night promotions.<ref>[http://www.thirdcoastsports.com/content.asp?CID=77705 "About Third Coast Sports."] Third Coast Sports. Retrieved on 30 January 2008.</ref> These [[Christianity|Christian]]-based promotional evenings include pre-game concerts from Christian music artists, [[Bible]]-themed [[bobblehead]] giveaways, and [[Testimony#Religious testimony|testimonials]] from players about their faith. Artists performing at Nashville's Greer Stadium in the past include [[Jars of Clay]], [[Hawk Nelson]], and [[Matthew West (musician)|Matthew West]]. Brent High, then Vice President of Sales for the Sounds, and Mike Snider, the President and owner of Third Coast Sports, an entertainment and sports marketing firm in Nashville, are credited with developing the promotion.<ref name=usatoday/>

Since their inception, Faith Nights have been among the top-ten most-attended games each season.<ref name=npr>Cornish, Audie. [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5434639 "Baseball Teams Woo Christian Fans to Games."] National Public Radio. 26 May 2006.

Retrieved on 23 October 2007.</ref> That fall, the team partnered with the Nashville Area [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]] to build a home for a needy family. The team raised more than $45,000 from 10% of ticket proceeds and collections during Faith Nights.<ref>[http://nashville.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2004/10/25/daily3.html Nashville "Sounds' 'Faith Nights' pay off for Habitat for Humanity project."] ''Nashville Business Journal''. 25 October 2004. Retrieved on 23 October 2007.</ref>

The promotion has since been adopted by at least 40 other minor league teams. It has also been used by major league teams such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Teams from the [[National Football League]] and [[National Basketball Association]] have also shown interest in holding Faith Night promotions.<ref name=npr/> The program has garnered national media attention for the Sounds from ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[National Public Radio]].<ref>St. John, Warren.

== Retired numbers ==
Nashville has honored two of its players by [[Uniform number (Major League Baseball)#Retirement of Numbers|retiring]] their [[Squad number#Baseball|uniform numbers]]. When a number is retired, no player on the team may wear that number in the future. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team.
