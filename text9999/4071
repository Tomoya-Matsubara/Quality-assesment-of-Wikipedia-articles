==History==
===Early life and education===
[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Front Arch).jpg|thumb|250px|Trinity College, Dublin]]Martin was born prematurely in the village of [[Ballylongford]], [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]] to a middle-class family<ref name="Cuneo">Cuneo, Michael W., ''American Exorcism: Expelling Demons in the Land of Plenty'', Doubleday, New York, 2001 ISBN 0385501765</ref> in which the children were raised speaking Irish at the dinner table and Catholic belief and practice were central<U+2014>his three brothers also became priests, two of them academics.<ref name="MM">{{citation|last=Doran|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Doran|title=Malachi Martin: God's Messenger - In the Words of Those Who Knew Him Best|publisher= Catholic Treasures|location= Monrovia|year= 2001| ISBN =1885692080|format=cassette}}</ref> He received his secondary education at [[Belvedere College]] in [[Dublin]], and became a [[Jesuit]] novice on September 6, 1939 at the age of eighteen. Due to the Second World War and the inherent risks involved with travel during this time, Martin remained in Ireland and studied at the [[National University of Ireland]] where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Semitic language]]s and [[oriental studies]] while carrying out concurrent study in [[Assyriology]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]].<ref name="MM"/>

Upon completion of his degree in Dublin, Martin was sent to the [[Catholic University of Louvain]] in Belgium to continue his education. During the four year stay in [[Leuven]] he completed [[master's degree|master]]s degrees in [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] and got doctorates in Semitic languages, [[archeology]] and Oriental history. On August 15, 1954, the [[Feast of the Assumption]], Martin was ordained a Jesuit priest at the age of thirty-three.<ref name="MM"/>

Martin started postgraduate studies at both the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and at [[Oxford University]], specializing in intertestamentary studies and knowledge of Jesus Christ and of Hebrew and Arabic manuscripts. He undertook additional study in rational [[psychology]], [[experimental psychology]], [[physics]] and [[anthropology]].<ref name="independent.co.uk">[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-malachi-martin-1110905.html Corley, Felix, ''Obituary: Malachi Martin''], The Independent, August 6, 1999</ref>

===Work and ordination===
Martin says he took part in the research of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and published twenty four articles on [[paleography|Semitic paleography]] in various journals.<ref>Martin, Malachi, ''Revision and reclassification of the Proto-Byblian signs'', Acta Orientalia, 31, 1962</ref><ref>Ward, William and Martin, Malachi, ''The Balu'a Stele: A New Transcription with Paleographic and Historical Notes'', Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, 1964, 8<U+2013>9</ref> He did archeological research and worked extensively on the [[Byblos syllabary]] in [[Byblos]],<ref>Martin, Malachi, ''Laures et ermitages du d<U+00E9>sert d'Egypte'', Imprimerie Catholique, Beyrouth, 1966 OCLC 418237964</ref> in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]],<ref name="KOK">Martin, Malachi ''King of Kings: a Novel of the Life of David'', Simon and Schuster, New York, 1980 ISBN 0671247077</ref> both in [[Lebanon]], and in the [[Sinai Peninsula]].

Martin travelled publicly and clandestinely to Eastern Europe and Soviet Russia during and after the reign of [[Pius XII]].  He said he carried out sacramental missions and was active in [[intelligence gathering]] for the church.{{cn|date=December 2011}}<ref name="RAMA"/>

[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|250px|St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City]]He was summoned to [[Rome]] to work at the [[Holy See]] as a [[private secretary]] for [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Augustin Bea]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} from 1958 until 1964. This brought him into contact with [[Pope John XXIII]].  His years in Rome coincided with the start of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962<U+2013>65), all of which sessions he attended<ref name="MM"/> and which was to transform the Catholic Church in a way that the initially-liberal Martin began to find distressing.<ref name="Cuneo">Cuneo, Michael W., ''American Exorcism: Expelling Demons in the Land of Plenty'', Doubleday, New York, 2001 ISBN 0385501765 ></ref> He became friends with Msgr. [[George G. Higgins|George Higgins]] and Fr. [[John Courtney Murray]] S.J.<ref name="Cuneo"/>

While in Rome, he became a professor at the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] of the Vatican, where he taught [[Aramaic]], paleography, Hebrew and Sacred Scripture.<ref name="MM"/>  He during that time also taught theology, part-time, at [[Loyola University of Chicago]]'s [[John Felice Rome Center]].<ref name="Cuneo"/> During that period his living quarters were in the Vatican, outside the papal quarters of John XXIII.<ref name="MM"/>  He worked for the Orthodox Churches and ancient Oriental Churches division of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity|Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity]] under Cardinal Bea, as a translator.  As a result of this,  Martin became well acquainted with prominent Jewish leaders, such as [[Rabbi]] [[Abraham Joshua Heschel|Abraham Heschel]], during 1961 and 1962.<ref name="Heschel">Kaplan, Edward R., ''Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America 1940-1972'', Yale University Press, New Haven, 2007 ISBN 0300115407</ref>  Martin also accompanied [[Paul VI]] in his pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] in January 1964.<ref name="RAMA"/> Martin resigned his position at the Pontifical Institute in June 1964.<ref name="Cuneo"/>

Disillusioned by the reforms taking place among the Jesuits, the Church's largest religious order,{{cn|date=December 2011}} Martin requested special [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] in February 1965.<ref name="Cuneo"/>  He received a provisional release in May 1965<ref name="Cuneo"/> and a definite release from his [[vow]]s of [[poverty]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]] on June 30, 1965,<ref name="Cuneo"/> after 25 years as a Jesuit religious, and left Rome suddenly in July.<ref name="DON">[http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15689 Dougherty, Jon E., ''Malachi Martin: Dispelling the Myths''], WorldNetDaily, August 2, 1999</ref>  He was not released from his vow of [[chastity]] and remained an ordained but secular priest. Paul VI gave him a general commission for exercising an apostolate in the media and communications.<ref name="MM"/>

After a stay of eight months in [[Paris]],<ref name="Cuneo"/> where he worked as a translator, Martin went to Ireland where he stayed with family.<ref name="MM"/> During his stay in Ireland he was falsely rumored to have a mental breakdown by local Jesuits.<ref name="MM"/> He moved permanently to [[New York City]] in 1966, where he first had to work as a dishwasher, a waiter and taxi driver<ref name="Cuneo"/> before being able to make his living by writing.<ref name="MM"/>  He co-founded an antiques firm and was active in communications and media for the rest of his life.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> The campaign of rumors of a problematic history concerning his mental health and moral behaviour was continued by American Jesuits.<ref name="MM"/>

After his arrival in New York, Cardinal [[Terence Cooke]] gave him written permission to exercise his secular priestly faculties.  The Cardinal advised him to find lodging with a family rather than live alone as he initially did. He moved to the [[Upper East Side]] [[Manhattan]] home of [[:Category:Livanos family|Kakia Livanos]] and her family.  She was his landlady and provided his rooms, his meals, and the oratory where he said daily Mass.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

===Communications and media===
[[File:Lower Central Park Shot 5.JPG|thumb|250px|Central Park, New York]]In 1964, Martin, under the pseudonym [[Michael Serafian]], wrote ''The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, The Council and The Church in a time of decision'', an [[apologia]] for the Jews, which, among other things, told the story of ''the Jewish question'' and the Second Vatican Council.

In 1967, Martin received his first [[Guggenheim fellowship]].<ref name="Encounter"/> In 1969 he got his first breakthrough with his book ''The Encounter: Religion in Crisis'' as a result of his expertise in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] and with which he won the [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] Book Award of the [[American Library Association]].<ref name="VAN">Martin, Malachi, ''Vatican: A Novel'', Harper & Row Publishers, New York, 1986 ISBN 0060154780</ref> Afterwards came other liberally oriented books like ''Three Popes and the Cardinal: The Church of Pius, John and Paul in its Encounter with Human History'' (1972) and ''Jesus Now: How Jesus has no Past, Will not come Again and in loving actions is Dissolving the Molds of Our Spent Society'' (1973).{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Martin became an American citizen in 1970.

He received a second Guggenheim fellowship in 1969, which enabled him to write his first of four [[bestseller]]s,<ref name="NYTBSL">New York Times Bestseller List</ref> ''Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Living Americans''.  With this book, published in 1975, Martin references his experience as an exorcist.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  According to the book he assisted in several [[exorcism]]s. In 1996, he spoke of having performed thousands of minor exorcisms, and participated<ref name="MM"/> in a few hundred major exorcisms during his lifetime.<ref name="Bell1">Bell, Art, ''Interview with Malachi Martin'', Coast to Coast AM, October 18, 1996</ref>

Psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck|Morgan Scott Peck]], author of ''The Road Less Traveled'', developed a friendship with Martin and was influenced by the latter in the development of his theories of [[evil]] and [[exorcism]].<ref>[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2002a/011102/011102i.htm Heffern Rich, ''<U+2018>Evil, be thou my good<U+2019>: Evil has a long history''], National Catholic Reporter, 11 January 2002</ref>

During that decade, Martin also served as religion editor for [[National Review]]<ref>Martin, Malachi, ''On Human Love'', National Review, September 2, 1977</ref><ref>Martin, Malachi, ''On Toying with Desecration'', National Review, October 10, 1975</ref><ref>Martin, Malachi, ''Death at Sunset'', National Review, November 22, 1974</ref> from 1972 to 1978, when he was succeeded by [[Michael Novak]].  He was interviewed twice by [[William F. Buckley, Jr]]. for [[Firing Line]] on [[PBS]].<ref>Buckley, William F. Jr., ''The Jesus Movement: Interview with Malachi Martin'', Firing Line, PBS, December 23, 1973</ref>  He also was an editor for the [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]].<ref>Martin, Malachi, ''There is Still Love: Five Parables of God's Love That Will Change Your Life'', Macmillan, New York, 1984, ISBN 0025804405</ref> His literary agent was [[Lila Karpf]].<ref>[http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/members/LilaKarpfAgency/ Lila Karpf Literary Management]</ref>

Martin published several books in quick succession the following years:  ''The Final Conclave'' (1978), ''King of Kings: a Novel of the Life of David'' (1980) and ''Vatican: A Novel'' (1986) were [[Faction (literature)|factional]] novels. ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Church]]'' (1981), ''The New Castle: Reaching for the Ultimate'' (1982), ''Rich Church, Poor Church: The Catholic Church and its Money'' (1984) and ''There is Still Love: Five Parables of God's Love That Will Change Your Life'' (1984) were [[non-fiction]] works.

His bestselling<ref name="NYTBSL"/> 1987 non-fiction book ''The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church'' was very critical of his previous ecclesiastical order.  The book accused them of systematically undermining church teachings and replacing them with communist doctrines.<ref>Martin, Malachi, ''The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church'', Simon & Schuster, New York, 1987 ISBN 0671545051</ref>

===Later life===

His book ''[[The Keys of This Blood]]: The Struggle for World Dominion between Pope John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Capitalist West'' was published in 1990 and was followed in 1996 by ''[[Windswept House]]: A Vatican Novel''.
Martin worked closely with the [[paranormal]] researchers [[Dave Considine]] and [[John Zaffis]] on several of their independent cases.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Martin continued to daily offer the [[Ordo Missae|traditional Latin mass]] privately, and vigorously exercised his priestly ministry all the way up until his death.  He was strongly supported by some [[Traditional Catholicism|traditional Catholics]] sources and severely criticized by other sources, such as the [[National Catholic Reporter]].<ref>[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/100804/100804zf.htm Woodward, Kenneth L., ''Looking for sanctity in all the wrong places''], National Catholic Reporter, 8 October 2004</ref><ref>[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/1996d/122796/122796k.htm Editiorial, ''Right and righteous who run with Ralph Reed'', National Catholic Reporter, 27 December 1996/3 January 1997]</ref><ref>[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/1998b/052298/052298h.htm Greeley, Andrew, ''Farrell<U+2019>s Hugo would be a papal Gorbachev'', National Catholic Reporter, 22 May 1998]</ref>

Martin served as a guest commentator for [[CNN]] during the live coverage of the pastoral visit of [[John Paul II]] to the United States October 4<U+2013>8, 1995.

He was a periodic guest on [[Art Bell]]'s radio program, ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'', between 1995 and 1998 and a guest of [[Michael Corbin]]'s radio program on [[Paranet Continuum]] radio.

In the last three years of his life, Martin had forged a close friendship with the traditional Catholic philosopher, Fr. [[Rama Coomaraswamy]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/aug/10/guardianobituaries3 Galati, Eric, Malachi Martin: A renowned biblical scholar, he clashed with the hierarchy on the role of the Roman Catholic church, The Guardian, August 10 1999]</ref>

In the final years before his death, Martin was received in a private audience by pope John Paul II.<ref name="RAMA"/> Afterwards, he started working on a book with the working title ''Primacy: How the Institutional Roman Catholic Church became a Creature of the New World Order''.<ref name="DON"/> This book which promised to be his most controversial and detailed work ever was never completed.{{cn}}

Martin suffered a minor stroke in the summer of 1998.

===Death===
[[File:Malachi Martin Footstone 2011C.jpg|thumb|The footstone of Malachi Martin in Gate of Heaven Cemetery]]
Martin died of [[brain hemorrhage]] after a fall in his apartment in [[Manhattan]], New York, in 1999. He was hospitalized, received the traditional [[sacrament]] of [[extreme unction]], and a few days later pronounced dead at [[Lenox Hill Hospital]].<ref name="RAMA"/>  His funeral wake took place in St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Chapel of [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. [[Requiem Mass]] for his repose was offered by the late [[Priest|Father]] Paul A. Wickens (April 14, 1930&nbsp;&ndash; July 8, 2004) before the burial within the [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery]], in [[Hawthorne, New York]].

===Family===

The Martin family had the following children.<ref name="MM"/>  Malachi Martin had 3 religious brothers: Rev. Prof. [[F.X. Martin|Francis Xavier Martin]] [[Augustinians|O.S.A.]], Rev. William (Liam) Martin and Rev. Prof. Conor Martin.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000315/ai_n14282274 Seymour, Phillips, ''Obituary: The Rev Professor F.X.

Another brother, James (Jim) Martin, who died very young.<ref name="MM"/>

Fr. Liam Martin, his brother, was private secretary to [[John Charles McQuaid]] [[C.S.Sp.]], [[Archbishop of Dublin]].<ref>[http://books.google.be/books?id=x74W2bt9zHkC&pg=PA366&lpg=PA366&dq=%22Michael+serafian%22&source=bl&ots=PIpkT2fFr5&sig=Oe0auLcm_SLD9DimVtymGPgK_Cw&hl=nl&ei=3T41S_L7Bs3W-QaI4dmuCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=34&ved=0CJ0BEOgBMCE#v=onepage&q=serafian&f=false Coony, John, ''John Charles McQuaid: Ruler of Catholic Ireland'', O'Brien Press, ..., 1999 ISBN 0862785944]</ref>

===Writings===
Martin produced numerous best-selling [[fiction]]al and [[non-fiction]]al literary works, which became widely read throughout the world. His fictional works gave detailed insider accounts of Church history during the reigns of Popes [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]], [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]], [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] (The Pilgrim, Three Popes and the Cardinal, Vatican: A Novel<ref name="NYTBSL"/>), [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] (The Final Conclave<ref name="NYTBSL"/>) and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] (The Keys of This Blood, Windswept House).

His non-fictional writings cover a range of Catholic topics, such as [[exorcism|demonic exorcisms]] (''[[Hostage to the Devil]]''), [[satanism]], [[Liberation Theology]], the Second Vatican Council (''The Pilgrim''), the [[Traditionalist Catholic|Tridentine]] liturgy, Catholic dogma, [[modernism]] (''Three Popes and the Cardinal''; ''The Jesuits''), the financial history of the Church (''Rich Church, Poor Church''; ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Church''), the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] and the geopolitical importance of the [[Pope]] (''The Keys of This Blood'').

His books, both fictional and non-fictional, frequently present a dark view of the present state of the world, invoking dark spirits, conspiracy, betrayal, heresy, widespread sexual perversion, self-advancement, and demonic possession, each being asserted as rife throughout the Catholic Church, from its lowest levels up to its highest.

===Opinions===

Supporters of Fr. [[Nicholas Gruner]] said Martin was privileged to secret information pertaining to Vatican and other world issues,<ref>[http://www.fatimacrusader.com/cr67/cr67pg41.asp The Fatima Crusader, 67, Summer 2001]</ref> which included the [[Our Lady of Fatima|apparitions of Our Lady in Fatima]].<ref name="MM"/> He spoke and wrote often about the [[Three Secrets of F<U+00E1>tima|three secrets of Fatima]] and was an ardent supporter of Gruner in this: "Father Gruner is fulfilling a desperately needed function in the ongoing perception of Mary's role in the salvation of our imperilled world. Father Gruner is absolutely correct that the consecration of Russia as<U+2014>Our Lady desired, has not been executed".<ref>U.S. News & World Report, ''Plotting World Order in Rome. Vatican expert Malachi Martin tries to scope out papal succession'', June 10, 1996</ref>

Martin said concerning the three secrets of the [[Virgin Mary]] as [[Queen of Heaven]] in Fatima in 1917, she mandated the pope of 1960 to consecrate [[Russia]] to her [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]]. The [[Russian orthodox church]] would then convert back. If the mandate were not followed, devastating war in the world and destruction inside the church ([[The Great Apostasy]]) would follow. He said that he stood outside the papal living quarters in 1960 whilst [[Pope John XXIII]] and Cardinal Bea and others were reading the document containing the third secret, and that, in order to assure Russian cooperation at the approaching [[Second Vatican Council]], the Pope decided against the mandate. Later Paul VI and John Paul II also decided against it for various reasons.<ref name="MM"/>

He was an outspoken opponent of the alleged apparitions of the [[Virgin Mary]] at [[Veronica Lueken|Bayside]] in the United States<ref name="RAMA"/> and [[Me<U+0111>ugorje]] in former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/6401/statement.html&date=2009-10-25+06:18:37  www.geocities.com]</ref> Martin regretted writing the foreword of ''The Thunder of Justice: The Warning, the Miracle, the Chastisement, the Era of Peace'', a 1993 book by Ted and Maureen Flynn<ref>Flynn, Ted and Flynn, Maureen, ''The Thunder of Justice: The Warning, the Miracle, the Chastisement, the Era of Peace'', MaxKol Communications, Sterling, 1993 ISBN 096343070X</ref> defending, among others, the apparitions in Me<U+0111>ugorje, stating that false pretences were used in obtaining his recommendation.<ref>[http://www.unitypublishing.com/Newsletter/Malachi%20Martin.htm Sabalto, Rich, ''Mystery Cloaks Father Malachi Martin<U+2019>s Death'', Unity Publishing's Weekly Newsletter, ..., 1999]</ref> Concerning the [[Garabandal apparitions]], he remained open-minded.<ref>Janzen, Bernard, ''The External War: Interview with Malachi Martin (1991)'', Toronto, Triumph Communications, 2004, ISBN 0973214813</ref>

In March 1997 Martin said on Radio Liberty's ''Steel on Steel'', hosted by [[John Loefller]], that two popes were murdered during the Twentieth century:
* [[Pope Pius XI]] was murdered on the orders of [[Benito Mussolini]], because of his 1931 [[encyclical]], [[Non Abbiamo Bisogno]], which was critical of the Italian fascist state.
* [[Pope John Paul I]] was [[Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories|murdered]]<ref name="LACR"/><ref name="ReferenceA">Loeffler, John, ''The Wisdom of Malachi Martin'', Radio Liberty, Soquel, March 1997</ref> according to Malachi's book, ''Vatican: A Novel'', by the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] under Pope Paul VI, [[Jean-Marie Villot]], under orders from the [[U.S.S.R.]].<ref name="VAN"/>

Martin also partially gave credence to the [[Siri Thesis]], saying that Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]] was twice elected [[pope]] in [[papal conclave]]s, but declined his election after being pressured by worldly forces acting through cardinals present at the conclaves.  Martin called this ''the little brutality''. On the one hand, Martin says that Siri was intimidated: on the other hand he says that Siri did indicate that his decision not to accept was made freely.<ref name="LACR">Les Amis du Christ-Roi, ''L'Eglise Eclips<U+00E9>e?

* The first occasion, according to him, was the [[Papal conclave, 1963]].  Martin mentions the possibility of a nuclear threat which involved "the very existence of the Vatican state" during this conclave on pages 600 to 610 of his book ''The Keys of this Blood'', which deals primarily with Siri and the 1963 conclave.
* The second time was the [[Papal conclave, October 1978]].  Martin said on Radio Liberty's programme ''Steel on Steel'', hosted by John Loefller, in March 1997 that Siri received a written note after his initial election threatening him and his family with death should he accept.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
Martin, who spoke many languages, was present at both conclaves as a translator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Martin claimed that Popes John XXIII and Paul VI were [[freemason]]s during a certain period and that photographs and other detailed documents proving this were in the possession of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Vatican State Secretariat]].<ref name="LACR"/> He also allegorically mentioned these supposed facts in his 1986 novel ''Vatican: A Novel'', where he related the masonic adherence of popes ''Giovanni Angelica'' and ''Giovanni De Brescia''.<ref name="VAN"/>  He also said that Archbishop [[Annibale Bugnini]] [[Congregation of the Mission|C.M.]] was a freemason and that [[Agostino Casaroli]], long time [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], was an [[atheism|atheist]].<ref name="LACR"/>

In his book ''The Jesuits'', published in 1987, Martin claims to prove the existence of a diplomatic agreement between the Vatican and the U.S.S.R. called the [[Metz Accord]].  The Vatican allegedly promised a non condemnation of communism in exchange for participation of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian-Orthodox]] prelates as observers at the Second Vatican Council.

In his book ''The Final Conclave'', published on 1 August 1978,<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671824848 www.amazon.com]</ref> the month of the 1978 [[Papal conclave, August 1978|conclave]] that resulted in the 28 August election of [[Albino Luciani]], Malachi Martin wrote of the unexpected election of a ''Cardinal Angelico'', a figure that has been interpreted as corresponding to Luciani.<ref>The Final Conclave, Stein and Day Publishers, New York, 1978 ISBN 0812824342</ref>

Martin stated that, along with [[demonic possession|diabolic possession]], [[spiritual possession|angelic possession]] also exists and that angels could have use of [[preternatural]] powers in certain circumstances.<ref name="MM"/><ref name="Bell1"/>

Martin was convinced that the [[antichrist]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]] was a literal historical figure, and was alive in 1996.<ref name="Bell1"/>

==Controversies==
===Alleged affairs===

There were two allegations made against Martin of having an affair with a woman:

* Malachi Martin was criticized most notably in the book ''Clerical Error: A True Story'' by [[Robert Blair Kaiser]], [[Time Magazine|Time Magazine's]] former Vatican correspondent. Kaiser, a former Jesuit, accused Martin of having carried on an extramarital affair with his wife during 1964 in Rome,<ref name="Cuneo"/> and claimed that Martin fled to the United States as a renegade from the priesthood. Throughout the book, Martin is presented as a liar and fantasist.<ref>[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2002a/030802/030802i.htm Jones, Arhur, ''A wicked priest and a shattered marriage'', National Catholic Reporter, 8 March 2002]</ref> A friend of Martin's, William H. Kennedy, published an article in the journal ''Seattle Catholic'' to dispute Kaiser's allegation and other claims made about Martin after his death.<ref>[http://www.williamhkennedy.com/occulthistory.pdf Kennedy, William H., ''Occult History'', 2008 pages 129<U+2013>157]</ref> Kennedy points out that Kaiser admits in his book that he was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia,<ref>Kaiser, Robert, ''Clerical Error: A True Story'', Continuum, New York, 2002, ISBN 0826413846, page 261</ref> and cites passages from Kaiser's book which he believes show that Kaiser was writing from a distorted and delusional perspective due to his mental illness. With regard to being a renegade from the priesthood, evidence is cited that suggests that Martin received a special dispensation in order to become a writer, while retaining his status as a priest with limited faculties.<ref name="MartinArticle">[http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=1812 Dougherty, Jon E., ''Catholic novelist Malachi Martin dies: Complications from stroke, fall cited'', WorldNetDaily, July 29 1999]</ref><ref name="GREEN">[http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=00CZfv Fr. Malachi Martin Again, Greenspun]</ref>

* In her 2008 book ''Queen of the Oil Club: The Intrepid Wanda Jablonski and the Power of Information'', [[Anna Rubino]] wrote that Martin had a love affair with oil journalist [[Wanda Jablonski]] on a visit to Beirut, Lebanon in the 1950s.<ref>Rubino, Anna, ''Queen of the Oil Club: The Intrepid Wanda Jablonski and the Power of Information'', [[Beacon Press]], Boston, 2008 ISBN 080707277X</ref> The book was published long after the deaths of both Jablonski (1992) and Martin (1999).

===Laicization dispute===

In 2004, Father [[Vincent O'Keefe]] S.J., former [[Vicar General]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] and a past President of [[Fordham University]], stated that Martin had never been [[laicisation|laicized]]. O'Keefe stated that Martin had been released as a religious from all his vows<U+2014>poverty and obedience<U+2014>save the vow of chastity.<ref name="dailycatholic.org">[http://www.dailycatholic.org/issue/04Apr/apr14hot.htm Cain, Michael, ''A Reputation Recouped!: The 'Fly on the Wall' is Freed at Last!'', The Daily Catholic, Vol. 15 No. 104 14 April 2004]</ref> Martin no longer was a Jesuit but remained a (secular) priest during the rest of his life.

The Vatican, on the other hand, has a different view. In a letter the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life states:

"In 1965, Mr. Martin received a dispensation from all privileges and obligations deriving from his vows as a Jesuit and from priestly ordination." [Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, 25 June 1997, Prot. N. 04300/65].<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/malachi_martin.htm ''Malachi Martin'', accessed July 23, 2010]</ref>

According to the Vatican Martin was not only released from religious vows but also his vows from "priestly ordination" (which means laicisation).<ref>[cf. CIC 701, 291<U+2013>292]</ref>

It is claimed that attacks were mounted on Martin in retaliation for his book ''The Jesuits'', which is hostile to the Jesuit order of which he had formerly been a member.<ref name="dailycatholic.org"/> In the book, he accuses the Jesuits of deviating from their original character and mission by embracing [[Liberation Theology]].<ref>[http://www.williamhkennedy.com/articles/highrankMM.html Kennedy, William H. & Widner S.J., Tom, ''High Ranking Jesuit Confirms Malachi Martin<U+2019>s Status as Life Long Priest'', WilliamHKennedy, April 2004]</ref>

===Ordination dispute===

During a videotaped memorial entitled ''Malachi Martin Weeps For His Church'', [[Rama Coomaraswamy]], a [[sedevacantist]] clergyman, claimed that Martin had told him that he had been secretly [[ordination|ordained]] a [[bishop]] during the reign of Pius XII in order to travel behind the [[Iron Curtain]] ordaining priests and bishops for the underground churches of [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Soviet Union]].  Coomaraswamy died in 2006.<ref name="RAMA"/><ref>[http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=64&catname=11 Anthony Cekada: ''Untrained and Un-Tridentine: Holy Orders and the Canonically Unfit'']</ref><ref>[http://www.coomaraswamy-catholic-writings.com/RC2b.jpg Coomaraswamy, Rama, ''On the Validity of My Ordination, CoomaraswamyCatholicWritings]</ref><ref>Ekelberg, Mary Ellen, ''The Underground Church of Pius XII'', Catholic Counterpoint, Broomall, ...</ref>

===Alleged authorship===
* The book ''The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, The Council and The Church in a time of decision'' was written by Martin under the pseudonym [[Michael Serafian]].  This was confirmed by Martin himself and corroborated independently by Prof. Dr. [[Hans K<U+00FC>ng]].<ref>K<U+00FC>ng, Hans, ''My Struggle for Freedom: Memoirs'', William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, 2003, ISBN 0802826598</ref> Martin related that his choice of surname, ''Serafian'', is due to meeting a carpet dealer in Jerusalem with that name, during the pilgrimage of Paul VI to the Holy Land in January 1964.<ref name="RAMA">Coomaraswamy, Rama, ''Malachi Martin Weeps For His Church'', Catholic Counterpoint, Broomall, 1999 OCLC 54977738</ref>

* The anonymously written book ''Complaints against God by One of His Creatures'' was not written by Martin but by Fr. [[Andrew Greeley]], a liberal priest.<ref>[http://books.google.be/books?id=Jcjpd8JzGmgC&pg=PA228&lpg=PA228&dq=andrew+greeley+%22complaints+against+god%22+hardback&source=bl&ots=VIlAIDbgwv&sig=yYZ1vwD2ele9Nzcus85FTK_h4AA&hl=nl&ei=ExEyS5nBM4au4Qbq0bCqCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CC4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false Kotre, John N., ''The Best of Times, The Worst of Times: Andrew Greeley and American Catholicism 1959-1975'', Nelson-Hall Company, Chicago, 1978 ISBN 088229380X]</ref>

* The pseudonym of [[Xavier Rynne]], used to write more than 20 books on Vatican II, is not that of Martin but of Fr. [[Francis X.

===Alleged service of Jewish interests===
Journalist [[Joseph Roddy]] alleged<U+2014>in a 1966 [[Look (American magazine)|Look Magazine]] article about the debate on the [[Jewish question]] during the Second Vatican Council<ref>Roddy, Joseph, ''How the Jews Changed Catholic Thinking'', Look Magazine, Volume 30 No. 2, January 25, 1966</ref><U+2014>that one and the same person under three different pseudonyms had written or acted on behalf of Jewish interest groups, such as the [[American Jewish Committee]], to influence the outcome of the debates.  Roddy wrote that two timely and remunerated 1965 articles were penned under the pseudonym of '''F.E. Cartus''', one for [[Harper's Magazine]]<ref>[http://www.harpers.org/archive/1965/09/0014899 Cartus, F.E., ''The Vatican Council Ends: Reform on borrowed Time?'', Harper's Magazine, September 1965]</ref> and one for the American Jewish Committee<U+2019>s influential intellectual periodical [[Commentary Magazine]].<ref>[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/vatican-ii---the-jews-3979 Cartus, F.E., ''Vatican II & The Jews'', Commentary, January 1965]</ref><ref>[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/searcharchive.cfm?year=1965 Cartus, F.E., ''Vatican II & The Jews'', Commentary, January 1965 (Letters)]</ref>  Roddy further stated that tidbits of information were leaked to the New York press that detailed Council failings vis a vis the Jews under the pseudonym of '''Pushkin'''.  Roddy also stated that these two unidentified persons were one and the same person<U+2014>a ''young cleric-turned-journalist'' and a ''Jesuit of Irish descent working for Cardinal Bea'' and ''who was active in the Biblical Institute''<U+2014>he figuratively named as '''Timothy O'Boyle-Fitzharris S.J.''' in order not to reveal the true identity of his source.  Roddy also mentions ''The Pilgrim'' in a footnote to his article.

In his 2007 book ''Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America'', [[Edward K. Kaplan]] confirmed that Martin cooperated with the American Jewish Committee during the Council ''for a mixture of motives, both lofty and ignoble''. He ''primarily advised the committee on theological issues, but he also provided logistical intelligence and copies of restricted documents''.  It is confirmed in the book that Martin used the pseudonyms '''Forest''' and Pushkin.<ref name="Heschel"/>  Kaplan further acknowledges that the ''kiss and tell book about the internal workings of the Council'', ''The Pilgrim'' by Michael Serafian, was requested from Martin by Abraham J. Heschel, who also arranged the book to be published by [[Roger W. Straus, Jr.]]'s [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] printing company.  It was published ''in the hope that it would influence the deliberations in the council''.<ref name="Heschel"/>  Once that Martin's identity as author was revealed, it led to protests ''and the book had to be removed from circulation at considerable financial loss to the publisher''.  This led to the end of friendly relations between Martin and Heschel and Straus.<ref name="Heschel"/>  Kaplan lastly states that Malachi Martin was the primary source of information for Joseph Roddy in writing his 1966 article for Look Magazine, and that Fr. Timothy O'Boyle-Fitzharris S.J. was in fact Martin.  Kaplan judges the Roddy article as ''dangerously misleading'' because of the ''credence it gives to the claim that without organised Jewish pressure the council declaration on the Jews would not have been accepted''.<ref name="Heschel"/>

Martin explicitly denied he was a spy, along with denying other rumors. Michael Cuneo, in his book ''American Exorcism'' writes that, "Martin told me that he was perplexed, and more than a little annoyed, by the swirl of rumors surrounding his personal life." He quotes Martin as saying:
<blockquote>
''Look, I've had three heart operations, recently open-heart surgery, and I'm at the point where I'd like to put some of these stories to rest," he said. "I've been accused of everything; speculation on my life is a veritable cottage industry.  I'm a lecher, a wife-stealer, and a spy; I'm secretly married with children; I've sexually abused little girls&mdash; it's all ''nothing but fancy''.''<ref name="Cuneo"/>
</blockquote>

===Alleged Jewish heritage===

Rumors appearing on various Catholic or [[Sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] websites<ref>[http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/dec05tcw.htm ''Today's Catholic World'', Daily News for the Church in Eclipse, December 2005]</ref> and magazines<ref>[http://www.nostra-aetate.org/HTML_La-lettre-Serviam/2009/SERVIAM_009.html#_ftn1 Serviam, January 12 2009]</ref> alleged that Malachi Martin had [[Jew]]ish ancestry on account of ancestral descent from [[Iberia]]n Jews migrating to Ireland and Great Britain in the 15th century, and alleged him being an [[Israel]]i spy<ref name="MM"/> because of his first name, ''[[Malachi]]'', after a Hebrew prophet and his extensive travels in the [[Levant]].  These allegations were rebutted by William H. Kennedy in his article ''In Defense of Father Malachi Martin''.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070302130404/http://www.geocities.com/whkinfo1/malachi_martinsophia.htm Kennedy, William H., ''In Defense of Father Malachi Martin'', Seattle Catholic, July 2002]</ref> After having made genealogical inquiries with surviving relatives of Martin in Ireland, Kennedy concluded that Martin's father was an Englishman who moved to Ireland and his mother was fully Irish. Fr. Rama Coomasrawamy confirmed this independently.<ref name="RAMA"/> The [[Irish language]] name ''Maelsechlainn'' is usually anglicised as [[Malachy]].

===Alleged photograph===

Claims that Martin features as a curial [[monsignor]] in full [[regalia]] on a prominent 1979 photograph next to Pope John Paul I and his assistant [[Diego Lorenzi]] appeared on the Internet.<ref>[http://www.puritans.net/news/malachimartin.htm www.puritans.net]</ref> The photograph, published in [[David Yallop]]'s ''In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I'' as number 28 between pages 120 and 121, shows a 'Monsignor Martin', visibly different from Malachi Martin.<ref>Yallop, David, ''In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I'', Constable & Robinson, London, 2007, ISBN 9781845294960</ref> This is a case of [[mistaken identity]]. The cleric in the photograph was [[Jacques-Paul Martin]], [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Prefect of the Casa Pontificia]] between 1969<U+2013>86.<ref>[http://www.albino-luciani.com/index.php?id=91&L=0 www.albino-luciani.com]</ref><ref>Martin, Jacques, ''Mes Six Papes: Souvenirs Romains du cardinal Jacques Martin'', Editions Mame, Paris, 1993</ref>
