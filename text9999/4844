'''Yo'nal Ahk III''' ({{IPA-myn|jo<U+02D0>nal ahk}}), also known as '''Ruler 5''', was an ''[[ajaw]]'' of [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], an [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya]] settlement in [[Guatemala]]. He ruled during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic Period]], from 758 to 767 AD. Yo'nal Ahk III ascended to the throne upon the death of [[Itzam K'an Ahk II]], who may have been Yo'nal Ahk's father. He was succeeded by his probable brother, [[Ha' K'in Xook]] in around 767 AD. Yo'nal Ahk III left behind several stelae at Piedras Negras, namely Stelae 14 and 16, the former of which has been called one of the finest niche stelae, according to [[Simon Martin (Mayanist)|Simon Martin]] and [[Nikolai Grube]].

==Reign==
{{Maya civilization}}
Yo'nal Ahk III, also known as Ruler 5, was likely the son of Itzam K'an Ahk II, based on Yo'nal Ahk III's fixation with venerating the mortuary temple of Itzam K'an Ahk II.<ref name=martingrube151/><ref name=witschey/> According to Walter Robert Thurmond Witschey and Clifford T. Brown, his name translates to "Black House Great Turtle".<ref name=witschey>[[#witschey|Witschey & Brown 2012]], p. 247.</ref> Yo'nal Ahk III ascended to the throne of [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] on March 10, 758 AD (9.16.6.17.1 7 Imix 19 Wo in the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]]), following the death of Itzam K'an Ahk II.<ref name=martingrube151/> Not much is known about the ruler, nor his successor [[Ha' K'in Xook]]; [[Flora Clancy]] refers to both reigns as "shadowy".<ref name=clancy135>[[#clancy|Clancy 2009]], p. 135.</ref> James L. Fitzsimmons argues that Yo'nal Ahk III seems to have been a weaker ruler when compared to the reign of Itzam K'an Ahk II because Yo'nal Ahk III erected few monuments, and he did not reinforce his power on a larger scale, choosing only to do so at local polities like [[El Cayo]] and [[La Mar]].<ref name=fitz>[[#fitzsimmons|Fitzsimmons 2010]], p. 154.</ref> 

Monuments at El Cayo record that Yo'nal Ahk III was involved in burial ceremonies for a ''sajal'' in 763 AD, although he was not involved in picking the leader's successor.<ref name=martingrube151/> It is also known that during his reign, a ''k'ini' ajaw''<U+2014>or prince<U+2014>of Piedras Negras, T'ul Chiik, was captured by [[Yaxun B'alam IV]] of [[Yaxchilan]]; it has been hypothesized by Martin and Grube that Yo'nal Ahk III's focus on smaller satellite kingdoms such as La Mar and El Cayo was a tactic to build up a support base in order to combat the growing threat that Yaxchilan posed.<ref name=martingrube151/><ref name= mesoweb >{{cite web|title=Yo'nal Ahk III|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/encyc/index.asp?passcall=rightframeexact&rightframeexact=http%3A//www.mesoweb.com/encyc/view.asp%3Fact%3Dviewexact%26view%3Dnormal%26word%3DIII%26wordAND%3DYonal+Ahk|publisher=Mesoweb Encyclopedia|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> He was succeeded by Ha' K'in Xook, who was possibly his brother.<ref name=sharer428>[[#sharer|Sharer & Traxler 2005]], p. 428.</ref>

==Monuments==
Only two monuments survive today that were erected by Yo'nal Ahk III, Stelae 14 and 16. Stela 14, which [[Simon Martin (Mayanist)|Simon Martin]] and [[Nikolai Grube]] have called the "finest of all 'niche' monuments", is the king's accession memorial. It was probably raised in 761 AD, and it depicts an effigy of the king in a small hollow, or niche.<ref name=martingrube151/> The monument was placed on the lower terrace of [[Pyramid O-13|Structure O-13]], and according to O'Neil, the stela's "form, imagery, and location acknowledged and responded to Structure O-13's participation in the processional circuit" of the site.<ref name=oneil185>[[#oneil|O'Neil 2014]], p. 185.</ref> The front of the monument features not only the ''ajaw'', but also his mother, who is positioned as a witness to her son; her positioning seems to imply that she had just arrived, by means of the processional route, from the West Group Plaza.<ref name=oneil185/> Stela 14 also includes the names of several sculptors and artists. These names are difficult to translate, since many are unique and not found in any other extant Mayan glyphic texts.<ref name=pitts>{{cite web|last=Pitts|first=Mark|title=A Brief History of Piedras Negras as Told by the Ancient Maya: History Revealed in Maya Glyphs|url=http://www.famsi.org/research/pitts/piedras_negras_history_part2.pdf|chapter=Royal Artists|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania{{!}}Pre-Columbian Society of the University of Pennsylvania Museum]]|accessdate=March 2, 2014|pages=146<U+2013>153|date=2011}}</ref>

Stela 16 celebrates the accession of a local ''sajal'', or Maya leader, at the nearby satellite kingdom of La Mar. [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] had originally used this stela to misidentify the sixth ''ajaw'' of Piedras Negras, assigning the title to the ''sajal'', instead of [[Ha' K'in Xook]]. The uniqueness of a La Mar ruler being celebrated on a Piedras Negras stela seems to signify that La Mar had, at the time of Yo'nal Ahk III and possibly earlier, attained a certain degree of importance in the Piedras Negras [[hegemony]].<ref name=martingrube151>[[#martin|Martin & Grube 2000]], p. 151.</ref> The front of the stela is eroded, but according to Megan O'Neil, it can be inferred that the monument had an image of Yo'nal Ahk III on the front, based on comparisons with other stelae at Piedras Negras, like Stelae 6 and 11.<ref>O'Neil 2014, p. 215.</ref>
