'''Breakdown''' is a comic published by [[Devil's Due Productions]] as part of their Aftermath line. It began in October [[2004]], and is written by [[Chuck Dixon]], and drawn by Dave Ross.

The story is set around Jeff Carey, who, when he discovers/receives his powers, decides to use them for good, as Paragon, the world's first [[superhero]]. He battles evil superhumans, such as Humongulous and Cactus Rose. He is loved by the media, by his wife, and by his daughter. One day, he is given a mysterious warning by a woman in a crowd. That night, his family is attacked. Only he survives, and his face is ruined. He tracks down the woman who warned him.

A year later, the special prison which houses Humongulous is attacked by a man with the same powers as Paragon. However, he wears a mask, and shares none of Paragon's morality...

As of Issue #2, it is revealed that Jeff Carey received his powers from his father. Where his father got them is unclear, but is likely to involve a secret organization known as the Black Ring.
