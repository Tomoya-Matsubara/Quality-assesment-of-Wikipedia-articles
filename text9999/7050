'''Kishka''' or '''kishke''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''kiszka''; [[Russian language|Russian]]: <U+043A><U+0438><U+0448><U+043A><U+0430>, ''kishka''; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: <U+043A><U+0438><U+0448><U+043A><U+0430>, ''kyshka''; [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <U+05E7><U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05E7><U+05E2>, ''kishke''), is a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word meaning "gut", or "[[intestine]]", which lends its name to varieties of [[sausage]] or [[pudding]] (see [[kaszanka]]).  The cooked kishke can range in color from grey-white to brownish-orange, depending on how much [[paprika]] is used.

==Kishke in [[Eastern European cuisine]]==

The [[Eastern Europe]]an kishka is a [[blood sausage]] made with [[pig]]'s [[blood]] and [[buckwheat]] or [[barley]], with pig's intestines used as a casing.  It is traditionally served at [[breakfast]].

==Kishke in [[Jewish cuisine]]==

The [[Jewish]] (specifically [[Ashkenazi]]) kishke is traditionally made from a kosher beef intestine stuffed with [[matzo]] meal, rendered fat ([[schmaltz]]) and spices.  Blood is not used, as it is [[taboo food and drink|forbidden]] by [[kashrut]]. 

In recent times edible synthetic [[casing (sausage)|casing]]s often replace the beef intestines.  Home cooks also often use kosher poultry neck skin to stand in for the intestines; it is cut, the bones removed, stuffed, and sewn up with an edible thread.  Such kishke is often used as an ingredient in [[cholent]], and this form is more usually referred to as "[[helzel]]".

Kishke is available in some [[kosher]] [[butcher]]ies and [[delicatessen]]s; in [[Israel]] it is available in the frozen-food section of most supermarkets.

There are also [[vegetarian]] Kishka recipes.  [http://www.angelfire.com/pa2/passover/recipes-pesach/kishka-recipe-kishke-vegetarian.html] [http://yedidya.org.il/recipes/kishka.htm]

=="Who stole the kishka?"==

"Who stole the kishka?" is a traditional [[polka]] tune.
