The '''[[Convair]] F-106A Delta Dart''' was the primary all-weather [[interceptor aircraft]] for the [[United States Air Force]] from the [[1960s]] through the [[1980s]]. Designed as the so-called "Ultimate Interceptor," it has proved to be the last dedicated interceptor in USAF service to date. It was gradually retired during the 1980s, although the '''QF-106''' drone conversions of the aircraft were used until 1998.<ref> Winchester 2006, p. 55.</ref>

==Design and development==
The F-106 emerged from the USAF's [[1954 interceptor]] program of the early [[1950s]] as an advanced derivative of the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] known as the '''F-102B''', with which the United States Air Force placed an order for in November [[1955 in aviation|1955]].  The aircraft featured so many modifications and design changes that it basically became a new design in its own right, and was redesignated '''F-106''' on [[17 June]] [[1956 in aviation|1956]].<ref> Pace 1991, p. 138.</ref>

The F-106 featured a more powerful J-75 afterburning turbojet with enlarged intake diameter to compensate for the increased airflow requirements, a variable geometry inlet duct which allowed the airplane improved performance particularly at supersonic speeds, also allowing for a shorter inlet duct. The fuselage was cleaned up and simplified in many ways featuring a modified, slightly enlarged wing area and a redesigned vertical tail surface. The airplane's exhaust nozzle featured a device known as an idle thrust reducer, which allowed taxiing without the jet blast blowing unsecured objects around, yet allowing virtually full performance at high thrust levels, including afterburners. The fuselage was also slightly longer than the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]].

Initial flight tests at the end of 1956 and beginning of [[1957 in aviation|1957]] were disappointing, with performance much less than anticipated, but after nearly abandoning the program, the Air Force decided to order 350 F-106s instead of the planned 1,000. After some minor redesign, the new aircraft, designated '''F-106A''' were delivered to 15 fighter interceptor squadrons along with the "F-106B" (a two-seat, combat-capable trainer version) starting in October [[1959 in aviation|1959]].<ref> Green 1964, p. 138.</ref>

In December 1959, Major Joseph W. Rogers set a world speed record of 1,525.96 mph (2455.79 km/h) while flying a Delta Dart at 40,500 feet (12,300 m).<ref> Drendel 1980, p. 92.</ref><ref> Donald 2003, p. 232.</ref>

The F-106 was equipped with the '''[[Hughes MA-1]]''' integrated [[fire-control system]], which could be linked to the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] network for [[ground control interception]] missions (allowing the aircraft to be steered by ground controllers). It was armed with four Hughes [[AIM-4 Falcon]] [[air-to-air missile]]s in its internal weapons bay along with a single GAR-11/[[AIM-26 Falcon|AIM-26A Falcon]] [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]]-tipped, semi-active, radar homing missile, or an 1.5 kiloton MB-2/[[AIR-2 Genie]] air-to-air [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]] rocket intended to be fired into enemy bomber formations.<ref> Winchester 2006, p.54. </ref> The MA-1 [[fire-control system]] proved extremely troublesome, and was eventually upgraded more than 60 times in service.<ref> Baugher, Joe.

==Operational history==
[[Image:Convair_F-106A_Delta_Dart_1.jpg|thumb|right|F-106A Delta Dart from California ANG fires the [[AIR-2 Genie]] nuclear rocket]]
The F-106 served in the continental USA, Alaska, Iceland as well as for brief periods in Germany and South Korea. The F-106 was the second highest sequentially numbered P/F- aircraft to enter service under the old number sequence (the [[F-111]] was highest sequential number), before it was reset under the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]] (the [[FJ Fury]] became the F-1). In service, the F-106's official name, "Delta Dart," was rarely used, and the aircraft was universally known simply as the "Six."
 
Although contemplated for use in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], it never saw combat, nor was it exported to foreign users. After its initial teething problems were resolved, its exceptional performance made it very popular with its pilots. Air-to-air combat testing suggested that the "Six" was a reasonable match for the [[F-4 Phantom]] in a dogfight, with superior high-altitude turn performance and overall maneuverability (aided by the aircraft's lower [[wing loading]]), although pilots conceded that the Phantom had better radar and missiles.<ref> Donald 2003, p. 259-260.</ref>  The [[F-4 Phantom]] also featured a greater missile capacity than the F-106, featured a higher thrust/weight ratio, superior climb performance, and better high speed/low-altitude maneuverability.

The F-106 was progressively updated in service, with improved [[avionics]], a modified wing featuring a noticeable conical camber, an [[Infra-red search and track|infrared search and track]] system, streamlined supersonic wing tanks which provided virtually no degradation to overall aircraft performance, better instrumentation, and features like an [[inflight refuelling]] receptacle and an [[arresting hook]] for landing emergencies.<ref> Donald 2003, p. 242, 246.</ref>

Some F-106As were upgraded in '''Project Six Shooter''' <ref>Donald 2003, p. 250.</ref> in [[1972 in aviation|1972]], fitted with a new [[bubble canopy]] without the metal bracing along the top (which greatly improved pilot visibility), an optical gunsight, and provision for a single [[M61 Vulcan]] 20mm [[cannon]] with 650 rounds of ammunition in the weapons bay, replacing the [[AIM-26]] Super-Falcon or the [[AIR-2]] Genie nuclear rocket. 

The [[F-15 Eagle|F-15A]] started replacing the F-106 in 1981, with the "Sixes" typically passed on to [[Air National Guard]] units.  The F-106 remained in service in various USAF and ANG units until [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref> Winchester 2006, p. 55.</ref>

Starting in [[1986 in aviation|1986]], many of the surviving aircraft were converted into drones, designated '''QF-106A''', and used for target practice. The last was destroyed in January [[1998 in aviation|1998]]. The drones were still capable of being flown by people, such as for ferrying to a test; during the test they were flown unmanned.<ref> Donald 2003, p. 270-271.</ref>A handful of F-106s were retained by [[NASA]] for test purposes through [[1998 in aviation|1998]]. 

==Variants==
*'''F-102B''' : The original designation of the F-106A:  Aircraft was fitted with the MA-1 Integrated Fire Control System with SAGE Datalink.  Aircraft fitted with J-75 afterburning turbojet, an enlarged intake diameter, variable geometry inlet ramps/shortened intake ducts, a refined fuselage shape, modified wings and redesigned tailfin;  tailpipe fitted with a device to reduce the tendency of the jet exhaust to blow unsecured objects around while taxiing, yet allowing virtually maximum performance at high thrust settings including afterburner.  Aircraft performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made.
::Weapons configurations (Speculated)
::2 x AIM-4 Falcon/2 x AIM-4 Falcon/2 x AIM-4 Falcon
::2 x AIM-4 Falcon/1 x AIM-26 Super-Falcon/2 x AIM-4 Falcon
::2 x AIM-4 Falcon/1 x AIR-2A Genie/2 x AIM-4 Falcon 
*'''F-106A''' : Modified F-106 with improved performance.  Maximum speed is at least Mach 2.5, with some estimates as high as Mach 2.85 in level flight.  The airplane is capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner with a significant range penalty.  Maximum altitude is at least 57,000 feet. Many were fitted with a conically cambered wing which improves takeoff, supersonic, and high-altitude flight.  To improve the airplane's range, the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined supersonic tanks which were capable of sustaining roll rates of 100 degrees per second.  Since these tanks produced virtually no significant performance degradation, they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around.  After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights, and provision for a gunpod in the center bay.
::Weapons configurations 
::2 x AIM-4 Falcon/2 x AIM-4 Falcon/2x AIM-4 Falcon
::2 x AIM-4 Falcon/1 x AIM-26 Super-Falcon/2 x AIM-4 Falcon
::2 x AIM-4 Falcon/1 x AIR-2A or AIR-2B Genie/2 x AIM-4 Falcon
::2 x AIM-4 Falcon/1 x Gunpod (650-rounds)/2 x AIM-4 Falcon
*'''F-106B''' : Two-seat, combat-capable training version.  Pilot and instructor are seated in tandem, rather than side-by-side to provide a more streamlined design.  Due to the design of the F-106B featuring a longer canopy design, the fuselage is actually better area ruled; that combined with a likely reduction in weight equate to an increase in overall top speed by a tenth of a Mach number. Maximum speed is at least Mach 2.6{{Fact|date=April 2007}}, with some estimates as high as Mach 2.95. {{Fact|date=April 2007}} Many were fitted with the conically cambered wing, improving the supersonic L/D ratio. <ref> It is uncertain as to whether the F-106B was fitted with the modified Project Sharpshooter optic sights, and gunpod provision.</ref>{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  
::Weapons configurations (same as F-106A) 
*'''NF-106B''' : This designation was given to two F-106Bs used as temporary test aircraft.  
*'''F-106C''' : Unbuilt version.  Aircraft was intended to have the AN/ASG-18 radar and fire control system fitted originally developed for the F-108A Rapier.  For its time it was the largest radar to ever be fitted to a fighter, actually requiring hydraulic actuators to turn the antenna.  To accommodate this larger radar system, the nose cone was longer and of a greater diameter. The design featured an improved raised canopy design featuring better visibility, canards and lengthened rectangular inlet ducts.  The aircraft was to be capable of carrying one GAR-9/AIM-47A in its center bay, and an AIM-26A in each side bay. At one time, the US Air Force had considered acquiring 350 of these advanced interceptors, but the F-106C/D project was cancelled on 23 September 1958. <ref> [http://home.att.net/~jbaugher1/f106_3.html] Note: After the cancellation of the Avro Arrow project, the Canadian government briefly considered the possibility of purchasing the F-106C/D. After the F-106C/D project was canceled, the Canadian government decided to acquire CF-101s instead. </ref>
*'''F-106D''' : Unbuilt version.
*'''F-106X''' : Unbuilt version (early 1968). Would have been outfitted with canards and powered by a JT4B-22 turbojet. It was envisioned as an alternative to the Lockheed YF-12, and was to have had a fire control system with "look-down, shoot-down" capability fed by a 40-inch radar dish.<ref> Donald 2003, p. 232.</ref>
*'''F-106E''' : Unbuilt version. On 3 September 1968, Convair issued a proposal for an "improved" interceptor that was to be designated F-106E/F. It was to be compatible with the upcoming airborne warning and control systems as well as with the "over-the-horizon" radar defense network. The F-106E/F would have had a longer nose and a new and improved radar with a look-down/shoot-down tracking and missile launch capability. It would also have had a two-way UHF voice and datalink radio. It would have been capable of launching both nuclear and non-nuclear missiles, including the AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon and the AIM-47. <ref> [http://www.airtoaircombat.com/background.asp?bg=228&id=52] </ref>
