'''''One Hundred Years of Evil''''' is a [[fictional]] [[comedy]] [[film]] taking the form of a [[documentary]] positing the possibility that [[Adolf Hitler]] did not die at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. Its directors are Erik Eger and Magnus Oliv; the film was written by the directors along with [[Olly Blackburn]] and Joacim Starander. Starring actors include Jon Rekdal, Jordi Almeida, Alexander Bareis and Lucy Bermingham.

==Plot==
The film is a [[mockumentary]] which examines the possibility that [[Adolf Hitler]] did not die at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. It centers around historian Skule Antonsen of [[Norway]] (Jon Rekdal) who along with film director Idelfonso Elizalde of [[Spain]] (Juli<U+00E1>n Elizalde) together investigate Adolf Munchenhauser (Dick Nilsson). Munchenhauser is an individual who bears a striking resemblance to Hitler, and he was taken captive in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] in 1945 by the [[Allies of World War II]]. He was one of 13 men transported on board a [[United States Air Force]] [[cargo plane]] who all happen to appear similar in appearance to Hitler.

After gaining freedom in 1946 from captivity in a facility called Camp Rebecca located in the [[Great Basin Desert]], Munchenhauser chooses to remain in the [[United States]]. Skule researches evidence surrounding Munchenhauser's activities in an effort to authenticate whether or not he is indeed Hitler. During the course of his investigation, Skule's research efforts are stymied by unknown individuals.

==Reception==
The film received a positive review from ''[[Fangoria]]'', "Going into ''One Hundred Years of Evil'' expecting a deadpan, seriously played piece of alternate history is a mistake, because Erik Eger and Magnus Oliv<U+2019>s movie is as comedic as faux journalism can get. Made for next-to-no money, it accumulates goofy jokes and clever twists of historical revisionism, while succeeding in its concept with a sheer dose of inventiveness and enthusiasm."<ref name="cayer">{{cite news|url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5220:fantasia-day-5-a-6-retreat-the-wicker-tree-etc&catid=119:fango-at-fantasia&Itemid=255|publisher=Fangoria Entertainment; www.fangoria.com|title=Fantasia Day 5 & 6: 'Retreat,' 'The Wicker Tree,' Etc.|first=Ariel Esteban |last=Cayer|date=26 July 2011|work=[[Fangoria]]|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref> The review praised the performance of Jon Rekdal as Skule Antonsen.<ref name="cayer" /> ''Ecrans'' noted, "There's much fun."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ecrans.fr/spip.php?page=imprimer&id_article=11565|language=[[French language|French]]|publisher=www.ecrans.fr|title=Trailer est-il ?

Sometimes I was wondering if I was watching an actual documentary, which I think, is the ultimate compliment for directors Erik Eger & Magnus Oliv. If you<U+2019>re looking for a twisted take on alternative history, ''One Hundred Years of Evil'' is a sure thing."<ref name="ainticoolnews">{{cite news|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/51428|publisher=Ain't It Cool, Inc.; www.ainticool.com|accessdate=20 October 2012|title=One Hundred Years of Evil (2010)}}</ref>

Associate Editor of ''Flixlist'' Alec Kubas-Meyer observed, "Unfortunately, One Hundred Years of Evil suffers from a pretty major identity crisis. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a mockumentary or a found footage film."<ref>{{cite news|first=Alec|last=Kubas-Meyer (Associate Editor)|work=Flixlist|title=Review: One Hundred Years of Evil|url=http://www.flixist.com/review-one-hundred-years-of-evil-210302.phtml|publisher=www.flixlist.com|accessdate=20 October 2012|date=18 May 2012}}</ref> Writing for ''Man, I Love Films'', Thaddeus Zwolfe commented, "Erik Eger and Magnus Oliv direct a movie that plays its premise and thesis beautifully. This picture does a great job of looking like the narrative moments were shot by a grad-level cameraman; beautiful scenes combine with excellent composition (the sunset shot is especially pretty), and the camera itself is a character with its own personality. The directors co-wrote with Joacim Starander and Olly Blackburn, and they conceived a smart picture."<ref name="zwolfe">{{cite news|last=Zwolfe|first=Thaddeus|work=Man, I Love Films|url=http://manilovefilms.com/reviews/2012/05/100-years-of-evil-review/|publisher=manilovefilms.com|title=Indie Spotlight: 100 Years of Evil|date=24 May 2012|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref> Serena Donadoni gave the film a grade of "B" in a review for ''IndieWire'', writing, "Blurring the demarcations of reality and fiction, 'One Hundred Years of Evil' transforms established history into subjective truthiness."<ref name="donadoni">{{cite news|first=Serena|last=Donadoni|work=IndieWire|title=Out This Week: 13 Reviews of New Indie Releases|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/out-this-week-13-reviews-of-new-indie-releases|publisher=SnagFilms Co.; www.indiewire.com|date=17 May 2012|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref>

Liz Ferguson of ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' called the film a "skilful mockumentary", and went on to note, "Directors Erik Eger and Magnus Oliv have a field day here.
They riff on conspiracy theories, cover-ups, things that are supposedly proven by computer analysis, the lone obsessive who clearly sees what others refuse to admit, people who enjoy sharing anecdotes from their past, anecdotes they<U+2019>ve probably told many many times by now, filmmakers who make themselves part of the story, etc., etc."<ref name="ferguson">{{cite news|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|first=Liz|last=Ferguson|accessdate=20 October 2012|title=Fantasia 2011: Review of One Hundred Years of Evil|date=25 July 2011|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc.}}</ref> A review by Justine Smith of ''Sound on Sight'' was negative, specifically criticizing the choice of film as a medium to tell the story, "As many mockumentaries do, this film suffers due to it<U+2019>s length and adhering far too closely to the model it is mocking. The flaw lies largely in the exploitative model itself, whose redundant and circular form favours the channel hopping home audience. The film might have actually succeeded better as a television series."<ref name="justinesmith">{{cite news|first=Justine|last=Smith|work=Sound on Sight|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/fantasia-2011-one-hundred-years-of-evil-is-a-one-joke-film/|publisher=www.soundonsight.org|title=Fantasia 2011: <U+2018>One Hundred Years of Evil<U+2019> is a one joke film|accessdate=20 October 2012|date=26 July 2011}}</ref>
