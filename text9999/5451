==Democratic movement==
[[Image:elbegdorj.JPG|300px|left|thumb|Elbegdorj talking at a demonstration, December 1989. Text reads in [[Mongolian language]]: "Cherish our history, embrace our freedom, develop our country"]]
During his studies in the USSR, Elbegdorj learned about [[Glasnost]] and concepts such as freedom of speech and economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met with other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo and threats by his employer to lose his job. When giving a speech at Young Artists<U+2019> Second National Congress on 28 November 1989, in the end of his speech, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed youth to collaborate and organize together to establish democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience <U+201C>We consider that [[Perestroika]] is a timely and brave step. Youth's contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is our objectives to be fulfilled. Our objectives are: <U+201C><U+2026>following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost, <U+2026> and to support truthful progressive power<U+2026>These are the objectives of an initiatives<U+2019> group. The group should be an organization that works. After the congress I hope we<U+2019>ll gather and discuss and you will participate in this (newly forming group). The organization shall be based on public, voluntary and democratic principles.<U+201D><ref name="young artists">{{cite book|last=Tsakhia |first=Elbegdorj |editors=Mongolian Democratic Union, New Period Youth Organization, and Mongolia's Young Leaders Foundation|title=The Footstep of Truth is White book "Speech of Ulaan Od newspaper's correspondent Elbegdorj at Young Artists<U+2019> Second National Congress" | publisher=Hiimori |place=Ulaanbaatar|year=1999 |pages=15|isbn=99929-74-01-X}}</ref>

The chairman of the congress stopped Elbegdorj's speech and warned him he could not say such things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that one out of two people was an unofficial spy of communist party that would oppress people who expressed different opinions than socialism and communism. During the break of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to initiate a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to other young people. Later the three, including Elbegdorj met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia's Democratic Revolution. At his return from the congress, his boss at the newspaper ''Ulaan Od'' warned Elbegdorj that he would be fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with other young people in the circle auditorium of the [[National University of Mongolia]] and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.<ref name="young artists" />

On the morning of 10 December 1989, the first open pro-democracy demonstration met in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar. There, Elbegdorj announced the creation of the Mongolian Democratic Union. Over the next months activists led by Elbegdorj and others continued to organize demonstrations, rallies, protests and hunger strikes, as well as teachers' and workers' strikes. Activists had growing support from Mongolia's people, both in the capital and the countryside and the union's activities led to other calls for democracy all over the country.<ref name="Harvard">{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Lindsay Hodges|title=

After numerous demonstrations of many thousands of people in the capital city as well as provincial centers, Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party(MPRP) (present [[Mongolian People's Party]])'s Politburo <U+2013> the authority of the government eventually gave way to the pressure and entered negotiations with the leaders of the democratic movement. In February 1990, [[Jambyn Batm<U+00F6>nkh]], chairman of Politburo of MPRP's Central Committee decided to dissolve the Politburo and to resign on 9 March 1990. Thus paved the way for the first multi-party elections in Mongolia. Elbegdorj announced this news to the hunger strikers and the people those gathered on Sukhbaatar Square at 10PM on that day after the negotiations between leaders of MPRP and Mongolian Democratic Union. As a result, Mongolia became the first country in Central Asia to embrace democracy.<ref name="PR Web">{{cite web|url= http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/01/prweb331736.htm|title= Mongolia's Former Communist Party MPRP Pulled the Rug Under Elbegdorj's Government|publisher=PR Web|date=13 January 2006|accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> Elbegdorj worked as the Leader of the Mongolian Democratic Union in 1989<U+2013>1997.<ref name="Sanders 2010 209">{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Alan J.K.|url=http://books.google.mn/books?id=5JN83EDDLl4C&pg=PR68&lpg=PR68&dq=elbegdorj+reconstruction+bank&source=bl&ots=lxglCkERG3&sig=XKva0Dc41sJuO5YIH-4fEie6CZ8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NBrJUdHgL8GqO6DKgHg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=elbegdorj%20reconstruction%20bank&f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Mongolia.

===First term as Prime Minister===
In 1998, a clause in the constitution was removed that prohibited members of parliament to take cabinet responsibility. Thus on 23 April 1998, Parliament elected (61<U+2013>6) Elbegdorj as the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|title=April 1998|url=http://rulers.org/1998-04.html|publisher=rulers.org|date=April 1998|accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> During his first term, Elbegdorj attempted to solve looming economic, political, structural and social issues through several policy initiatives such as co-initiating Law on Press Freedom and playing a key role to pass the law in 1998.<ref name="Ukraine">{{cite web|title=Mongolia President Elbegdorj arrives in Lviv to start state visit|url=http://www.ukrainebusiness.com.ua/news/2653.html|publisher=Ukraine Business Online|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref> Based on this law, another law passed that changed all daily state newspapers into public newspapers without direct control and censorship from the government.

Elbegdorj's most significant achievement during his first term as Prime Minister was to collect tax and create tax income. The biggest tax payer and only significant income contributor to the government's budget at the time was the copper ore mining and processing Erdenet Mining Corporation(EMC) <U+2013> a joint stock company owned by the governments of Mongolia and the Russian Federation. EMC hadn't paid due tax, income and royalty to Mongolia's government between 1997<U+2013>1998 which resulted in the government financial crumbling.<ref>{{cite web|last=CA|first=Jeff|url= http://seekingalpha.com/user/5515511/comments/highest-rated|title=Comment on SouthGobi Executive Under Exit Ban|publisher=Seeking Alpha|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref> Because of this, previous Prime Minister Enkhsaikhan stepped down due to pressure from the opposition party, MPRP. After becoming Prime Minister, Elbegdorj ordered an audit of EMC.

In addition, at the recommendations of international financial institutions such as International Monetary Fund and the World Bank <U+2013> aid granters to Mongolia, and discount interest rate loan giver Asian Development Bank, Elbegdorj made a decision to sell state owned Reconstruction Bank which became illiquid and was experiencing enormous loss, the biggest financial burden to the economy since its establishment in 1997.<ref name="Baabar">{{cite web|url=http://platinum.blog.banjig.net/post.php?post_id=117288|title=Baabar says this: Enkhbayar Era|publisher=baabar.mn(in Mongolian)|date=26 December 2008|accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> [[Golomt Bank]] was the only one that offered to buy Reconstruction Bank.

Elbegdorj has committed Mongolia to be nuclear-free and a nuclear free world as a principal component of his foreign policy agenda. The United Nations [[Security Council]] recognized Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status in 2012 despite the fact that it cannot join one of the World's Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zones, in part, because of the country's close proximity to nuclear-armed states Russia and China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Stephen|title=Mongolia's nuclear weapon free status recognized|publisher=U.S. Department of State|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2012/09/20120919136258.html#axzz289pjk8T5|accessdate=3 October 2012|date=19 September 2012}}</ref>[[File:President Tsakhia Elbegdorj of Mongolia with President Barack Obama of the US.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Elbegdorj meeting with President Obama in June 2011]]Mongolia renounced nuclear materials and became a member of [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2013 and UN General Assembly's President Vuk Jeremic congratulated Elbegdorj for these.<ref>{{cite news|last=Radojcic|first=Maja|title=President of the UN Assembly Vuk Jeremic visited Mongolia|publisher=In Serbia|url=http://inserbia.info/news/2013/06/president-of-the-un-assembly-vuk-jeremic-visited-mongolia|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref>

Elbegdorj made international headlines in 2012 after being the first world leader invited to visit the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz. After his visit, he stressed "the program has to be transparent to the world; in particular, the program must be under permanent supervision of the United Nations and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. Iran's nuclear program must not endanger or cause threat to the interests and security of regional peace as well as of any other nation. Mongolia remains committed to safeguarding her nuclear free status, supported by the special UN resolutions. Mongolia will seek to contribute to securing universal peace by fully banning nuclear weapons in East Asia and the world at large.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news|last=Karimi|first=Nasser|title=Iran opens nuclear site to Mongolia's president|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-09-03/iran-opens-nuclear-site-to-mongolias-president|accessdate=23 June 2013|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=3 September 2012}}</ref>

In September 2009 Elbegdorj replaced the Community Council of Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) formed by former President [[Nambaryn Enkhbayar]] which included sports and music stars and supreme clergy while expressing his dissatisfaction with its investigation of petty corruption instead of political level corruption.<ref>{{cite news|title=Independent Authority Against Corruption and the President|url=http://news.gogo.mn/r/60592|accessdate=21 June 2013|publisher=gogo.mn (in Mongolian)|date=9 October 2009}}</ref> He then reorganized the council with professional lawyers.<ref>{{cite web|title=New community council established by the president visited IAAC|publisher=Independent Authority Against Corruption of Mongolia|url=http://www.iaac.mn/index.php?coid=492&cid=19|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=7 October 2009}}</ref>

To create a dialogue among different stakeholders in the natural resources and mining community to stop corruption Elbegdorj opened a roundtable in Ulaanbaatar in collaboration with the [[World Economic Forum]]'s ''Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI)'' in March 2011.

Elbegdorj sees [[Genghis Khan|Chinggis Khaan]] (also referred to as Genghis Khan) as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. "Chinggis...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces," Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speech by Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, President of Mongolia at a solemn assembly, dedicated to the 850th anniversary of birth of Chinggis Khaan|publisher=Office of the President of Mongolia|url=http://www.president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=848|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=14 November 2012}}</ref>

===Women's rights===
Elbegdorj has long been an advocate for women's rights and more proportional representation of women in decision making level of governments. He stressed the importance of women in leadership, highlighting the three-fold increase of women representatives elected in the 2012 Mongolian parliamentary elections in his speech at the [[UN General Assembly]] in September 2012. <U+201C>We need more women leaders. Women tend to see the whole picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels <U+2013> local to global. They bring an unique perspective often missing in global challenges<U+2026> Have you ever heard of a woman bloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were more women in power, I think we would have more harmony, more engagement and less suffering and less conflict,<U+201D> Elbegdorj said.<ref name="Empower Women" />

In July 2012 during the meeting with Elbegdorj in Ulaanbaatar, U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] praised Mongolia's recent parliamentary elections in which nine women were elected and applauded Mongolia for its "courage" in building a democratic system in a country surrounded by Russia and China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Perlez|first=Jane|title=From Mongolia, Clinton Takes a Jab at China|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/world/asia/in-mongolia-clinton-offers-message-to-china.html?_r=2&hp&|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|place=New York|date=9 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Areddy|first=James|title=Clinton Praises Mongolian System|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303343404577516452804920704.html|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|place=New York|date=9 July 2012}}</ref>

===Citizens Chamber===
In 2009, Elbegdorj opened the Citizens Chamber-a public hearing forum which encourages the participation of Mongolian citizens in the parliament's decision making. In each proceeding, citizens are given time to speak and express their opinion on pending legislation. The hall is open to any of Mongolia's 2.9 million people and is located in [[Ulaanbaatar]]; some additional halls have been opened in other provinces. They are designed to encourage civil participation to have consensus between legislators and citizens before any open issue becomes law.<ref name="Democracy's Hero" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Harding|first=Andrew|title=Citizen's Hall Mongolia|url=http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-hall-mongolia|publisher=participedia.net|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=6 September 2011}}</ref>

===Abolition of capital punishment===
On 14 January 2010, Elbegdorj announced that he would, henceforth, systematically use his prerogative to pardon all persons [[sentenced to death]]. He stated that [[Use of capital punishment by nation|most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty]], and Mongolia should follow their example. He suggested that it would be replaced with a thirty year prison sentence. The decision was controversial; when Elbegdorj announced it in [[State Great Khural|Parliament]], [[MPRP]] represesentatives chose not to give the applause customarily due after a presidential speech.<ref>{{cite news|title=Le pr<U+00E9>sident mongol veut abolir la peine de mort|newspaper=Le Monde (in French)|place=Paris|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/asie-pacifique/article/2010/01/14/le-president-mongol-veut-abolir-la-peine-de-mort_1291441_3216.html|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref> (See: [[Capital punishment in Mongolia]])

Despite the harsh criticism from conservative politicians and the opposition, Elbegdorj's decision to abolish the death penalty and his insistence on adopting the 2nd Optional Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights was received highly among other nations around the world."Hands off Cain" international organization awarded Elbegdorj with "Abolitionist of the Year 2011" noting Mongolia as an example that fosters the right to life among Asian countries.<ref>{{cite news|title='Abolitionist of the Year 2011' awarded to Mongolian President Elbegdorj|publisher=Hands off Cain|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=15312549|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref>

"By ratifying the Second Optional Protocol Mongolia would add yet one more country in the world community to fully abolish the death penalty. Pardoning a life does not mean pardoning a penalty. The punishment for serious and cruel felonies must be severe, and must be just. However, I do not think it is just to deprive any citizens of life in the name of state. The right to life is one of fundamental rights of a human being and cannot depend on anyone, not even on the head of state. The state should respect very fundamental human rights, and secure them by law." Elbegdorj noted.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tsakhia|first=Elbegdorj|title=Greetings of the President of Mongolia Tsakhia to the delegates of the 5th international meeting of Ministers of Justice "From moratorium to abolition of the capital punishment-No justice without life"|publisher=Office of the President of Mongolia|url=http://www.president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=249|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=18 May 2010}}</ref> Finally, in 2012 Mongolian parliament amended a law to join the 2nd Optional Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights; making Mongolia a state party to the convention and reinforcing the country's commitment to the abolition of capital punishment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mongolia takes 'vital step forward' in abolishing the death penalty|publisher=Amnesty International|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/mongolia-takes-vital-step-forward-abolishing-death-penalty-2012-01-05|accessdate=8 August 2012|date=5 January 2012}}</ref>

They discussed about water use in the mining, agricultural and municipal sectors, shared case studies of international good practice for boosting water efficiency and ways of safeguarding Mongolia<U+2019>s water supplies. As a result, Elbegdorj and [[Peter Brabeck-Letmathe]], Chairman of the World Economic Forum-Water Resources Group and Member of the World Economic Forum Foundation Board, committed to form a Mongolian Water Alliance of key government entities, civil society representatives and private sector participants to support the transformation of Mongolia<U+2019>s water sector. Elbegdorj defined the purpose of the alliance by saying <U+201C>Managing our future water needs is key to sustaining Mongolia<U+2019>s economic growth. We must ensure fast and effective implementation of our National Water Plan.

By the implementation of the decree, Mongolian students accepted at the world's 20 top universities will receive funding from the government regardless of their major, and those accepted at the world's 100 top universities will be financed by the government if their major is included in the government's preferred professions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mongolian President issues a decree to support students studying in the world's top universities|publisher=infomongolia.com|url=http://www.infomongolia.com/ct/ci/6025|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=21 May 2013}}</ref>

Elbegdorj put a veto on a section of a law amendment that would increase his salary; in return, he submitted a bill to the Parliament to give allowance as salary from government to all Mongolian students studying in Mongolia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tsakhia|first=Elbegdorj|title=Elbegdorj:"The Parliament has to resolve students' salaries and tuition first, before deciding to increase the president's salary"|publisher=Office of the President of Mongolia|url=http://www.president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=399|accessdate=June 22, 2013|date=October 29, 2010}}</ref> The law was passed and all Mongolian students studying at any university or college in Mongolia have received monthly allowances of 70,000 tugrugs since 2011 and the allowance may be increased to 96,000 tugrugs as per government decision in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=P.|first=Galaa|title=Students' 70 thousand will become 96 thousand from next September|publisher=undesten.mn (in Mongolian)|url=http://undesten.mn/s/26055|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=16 April 2013}}</ref>

Elbegdorj is a permanent member of the board of directors of "Young Leader" foundation of Mongolia from 1992 and a member of the director's board of the Mongolian Academy of Political Education since 1993.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elbegdorj Tsakhia - Biography|publisher=Mongolia-web.mn|url=http://www.mongolia-web.com/1179-elbegdorj-tsakhia-biography|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=15 July 2007}}</ref>

===Campaign to stop alcoholism===
Elbegdorj has been calling to curb the abuse of alcoholic beverages in Mongolia. Under his patronage and in collaboration with his office, civil society and non-governmental organizations organized many activities such as Alcohol-Free Mongolia campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mongolian President HE Elbegdorj Tsakhia receives WHO Regional Director's First Special Recognition Award for Alcohol Control | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mongolia/mediacentre/rd_recognition/en/index.html|date=24 October 2012|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref> Elbegdorj banned the use of all alcoholic beverages at state dinners and state ceremonies under his name.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Network for Mongolia without Alcohol|publisher=National Network for Mongolia without Alcohol (in Mongolian)|url=http://www.arhiguimongol.mn|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> Also he called government and its agencies not to serve alcohol at official ceremonies and functions. The World Health Organization awarded Elbegdorj its Regional Director<U+2019>s special recognition plaque. The award honors the public health leadership of a country leader and it is the first award for alcohol control in Western Pacific Region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mongolian President HE Elbegdorj Tsakhia receives WHO Regional Director<U+2019>s First Special Recognition Award for Alcohol Control| url=http://www.un-mongolia.mn/new/?p=294|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref>

==Family and personal life==
Elbegdorj met Khajidsurengiin Bolormaa at a Mongolian students<U+2019> party in Lviv, Ukraine when they were students. After their marriage in [[Ulaanbaatar]], their first son was born in Lviv, Ukraine. They helped over 300 orphans through their Bolor Foundation. They adopted twenty children from state run Orphan Care Center ([[orphanage]]) in Ulaanbaatar after being the children's patrons for some time.<ref>{{cite news| title= Kh.Bolormaa: Only one politician for a family interview |newspaper=Ardchilal (Democracy) ''newspaper(in Mongolian)''|place=Ulaanbaatar|date=May 2009|edition=Special edition |pages=9}}</ref> Now they have twenty five children: four sons of their own and twenty one adopted children.<ref name="Ganchimeg" /><ref name="Desai" />

"Elbegdorj is a risk-taker and puts others' needs before his own. A long-time (U.S.) Embassy employee recalled Elbegdorj accompanying the embassy officials on a trip to deliver humanitarian assistance to the countryside during a winter disaster in the 1990s. The road was snowed under, and Elbegdorj volunteered to go ahead to check for alternate routes, despite freezing conditions and deep snow," an U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia described Elbegdorj in his confidential wire to the U.S. authorities that was leaked in wikileaks.org.<ref name="wikileaks" />

Due to being president, Elbegdorj asked his elder brother Arslandorj to give up from his position as a director of City Landscaping Department of Ulaanbaatar City in which sector Arslandorj worked for more than 20 years prior to his brother's presidency. Arslandorj quit his career at his brother's request. Also Elbegdorj tweeted announcing his job search in Mongolia for his eldest son Orgil who got Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry from [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in the United States. The son got a job at a private pharmaceutical company in Mongolia later.<ref>{{cite news| title=President Ts.Elbegdorj, who could not have provided job to his brothers and sisters, put an ad in internet seeking work for his son|url=http://www.shudarga.mn/news/14677.html|publisher=shudarga.mn (in Mongolian)|date=10 May 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> Elbegdor's second son Erdene is a soldier in the [[Mongolian Armed Forces]] and has been participating in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan since March 2013.<ref>{{cite news| title=President's son greets from South Sudan|url=http://www.olloo.mn/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1228752|publisher=olloo.mn (in Mongolian)|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref><U+00A0> <U+00A0>
