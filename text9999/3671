'''Safflorite''' is a rare [[cobalt]] [[iron]] [[arsenide mineral]] with formula: ([[cobalt|Co]],[[iron|Fe]])[[arsenic|As]]<sub>2</sub>. ''Pure'' safflorite would be just CoAs<sub>2</sub>, but iron is virtually always present. Safflorite is a member of the three-way substitution series of arsenides known as the l<U+00F6>llingite or [[l<U+00F6>llingite]] group. More than fifty percent iron makes the mineral loellingite whereas more than fifty percent [[nickel]] and the mineral is [[rammelsbergite]]. A parallel series of [[antimonide mineral]]s exist. 

Safflorite along with the other minerals crystallize in the [[orthorhombic]] system forming opaque gray to white massive to radiating forms, Clinosafflorite has a monoclinic symmetry. It has a [[mohs hardness]] of 4.5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 6.9 to 7.3. [[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is common and star shaped twins are frequently found. 

It was first described in 1835 from the Schneeberg District, Erzgebirge, [[Saxony]], [[Germany]]. Safflorite occurs with other arsenide minerals as an accessory in [[silver]] [[mining]] districts. It alters to the arsenate [[erythrite]] in the secondary environment.
