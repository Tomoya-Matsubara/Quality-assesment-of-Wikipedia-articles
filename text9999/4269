== Background ==

The single was the second time Hamasaki had released an official single digitally after "[[Together When...]]" (2007), the leading song from her album ''[[Guilty (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Guilty]]''. It had been three years since a song by Hamasaki had been used as a drama theme song, since "[[Sunrise/Sunset (Love Is All)|Sunrise (Love Is All)]]"'s use for ''Dandy Daddy?''.

For the second series of ''Saigo Kara Nibanme no Koi'' in 2014, a new song by Hamasaki, "Hello New Me", served as the theme song.

== Writing and production ==

The music of the song was written by her musical collaborator Tim Wellard, who first worked with Hamasaki on the song "Brillante" from her extended play ''[[Five (EP)|Five]]'' (2011), and also wrote the songs "Party Queen", "The Next Love" and "Eyes, Smoke, Magic" for ''Party Queen''. Fuji Television director Hiroki Wakamatsu commissioned Hamasaki for the drama's theme song, asking her to write a grown-up song. Hamasaki wrote the song's lyrics after reading the drama's script.<ref>{{cite web |title=<U+30C8><U+30D4><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30B9><U+3000>Vol. 1 |url=http://www.fujitv.co.jp/nibanmeno_koi1/topics/index01.html |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |year=2011 |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref>

== Music video ==

A music video was produced for the song, directed by Masashi Muto.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spaceshowertv.com/search/detail.cgi?mu=0089291&ch=0 | title=how beautiful you are |publisher=Space Shower | language=Japanese | accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> It features Hamasaki singing in monochrome, and depicts couples of different races and sexual orientations. Japanese gay porn star [[Koh Masaki]] and his partner Tien Tien made cameos as one of the couples, a year before Masaki's death in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.queerty.com/remembering-masaki-koh-what-made-the-late-gay-porn-star-so-special-20130612 | title=Remembering Masaki Koh: What Made The Late Gay Porn Star So Special? |author=Benji Douglas |publisher=Queerty | date=June 12, 2013 | accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref>

The dress she wore in the video was specially made for her by Indonesian fashion designer [[Tex Saverio]].<ref>http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/08/30/tex-saverio-s-couture-infused-fallwinter-collection.html</ref>

== Critical reception ==

The song received mixed reviews. CDJournal called the song a "beautifully magnificent ballad" that displayed Hamasaki's presence, however felt that the song's arrangement was disappointing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://artist.cdjournal.com/d/party-queen/4112020088 | title=<U+6D5C><U+5D0E><U+3042><U+3086><U+307F> / Party Queen [CD+2DVD] |publisher=CDJournal | language=Japanese | accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref> Music reviewer James Hadfield for Time Out Tokyo reacted strongly to the song, describing it as "wretched" and "generic".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/5560/Ayumi-Hamasaki-Party-Queen | title=Ayumi Hamasaki: Party Queen |author=James Hadfield |publisher=Time Out Tokyo |date=March 22, 2012 | accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref>
