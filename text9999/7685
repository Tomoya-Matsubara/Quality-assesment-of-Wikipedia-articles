{{nihongo|'''''Sonic X'''''|<U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>X|Sonikku Ekkusu}} is a Japanese [[anime]] series created by [[TMS Entertainment]] and based on the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video game series published by [[Sega]]. The series initially ran for fifty-two episodes, which were broadcast on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004; a further twenty-six were aired in non-Japanese regions such as the United States, Europe, and the Middle East from 2005 to 2006. The show's American localization and broadcasting were handled by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]]<U+2014>which [[editing of anime in American distribution|heavily edited the content]] and created new music<U+2014>until 2012, when [[Saban Brands]] obtained the rights to the series.

The plot follows a group of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals originating from the games<U+2014>such as [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Amy Rose]], and [[Cream the Rabbit]]<U+2014>and a human boy named Chris Thorndyke, whom the animals meet after teleporting from their home planet to Earth. While on Earth, they repeatedly scuffle with antagonist [[Doctor Eggman]] and his robots over control of the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]], while also adjusting to their status as celebrities. The final story arc sees the friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo and fight an army of giant robots called the Metarex.

''Sonic X'' received mixed reviews from critics. Generally, writers criticized its American localization and some of the characters, while being more generous toward its story and aesthetics. The series was very popular in the United States and France, though less so in its native Japan. The show's merchandise included an [[edutainment]] video game for the [[Leapster]], a [[trading card game]], a [[comic book]] series featuring an original storyline, and various toys and other items. The phrase "gotta go fast", the title of the show's North American theme song, has survived as a ''Sonic'' catchphrase for over a decade after the show's initial release.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Sonic X episodes|List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|Sonic Adventure|Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Battle}}
[[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] attempts to destroy the base of [[Doctor Eggman]] and retrieve seven [[Chaos Emeralds]]. One of Eggman's robots inadvertently shoots a machine containing the Emeralds, which activates the "Chaos Control" technique. This teleports Sonic, Eggman, and some of Sonic's other [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] friends<U+2014>[[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Amy Rose]], [[Cream the Rabbit]] (with Cheese the [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]]), Cream's mother [[Vanilla the Rabbit|Vanilla]], [[Big the Cat]] (with his frog Froggy), [[Rouge the Bat]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and the [[Chaotix]] (a detective crew comprising [[Espio the Chameleon]], [[Vector the Crocodile]], and [[Charmy Bee]])<U+2014>to Earth, the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel-universe]] version of their world. Sonic is chased by police, escapes into a mansion's swimming pool, and is rescued by a twelve-year-old boy named Chris Thorndyke, who lives there with his movie-star mother Lindsey, corporate executive father Nelson, scientist grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Tanaka. Chris tries to hide the animals from his family until Cream accidentally reveals them, but they all build up a good rapport with Chris' family and with Chris' friends Danny, Francis, and Helen.

The animals still want to return home, so they repeatedly scuffle for the Emeralds with Eggman, his robot assistants<U+2014>the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe<U+2014>and his larger, armed robots. Eggman plans to take over the world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other animals soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes. However, the unfazed Eggman awakens a creature named [[Chaos (Sonic)|Chaos]] from a huge gem called the Master Emerald. The animals fight a losing battle to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named [[Tikal the Echidna|Tikal]], who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millenia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|Super Sonic]], he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.

Shortly afterwards, Eggman finds his grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]'s diary and Gerald's old project [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]] in a military base. After being released by Eggman, Shadow breaks into a museum to steal an Emerald and is mistaken for Sonic, which gets Sonic arrested. Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the space colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the [[Moon]] to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will destroy Earth in hours. Everyone works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic until Chris convinces him. Shadow and Sonic power up using the Emeralds and reroute the ARK away from Earth, seemingly killing Shadow. Eggman rebuilds the Moon, seemingly out of remorse, but its position shifts, creating a [[solar eclipse]], so he manufactures and sells "Sunshine Balls" to replicate sunlight. Sonic sees through his greedy motivations, and Eggman is arrested for fraud. Bokkun activates a robot named [[Sonic Battle|Emerl]], who quickly allies with the animals, and Eggman escapes prison. Emerl wins an Emerald in a martial arts tournament involving numerous hero and villain characters, but he goes berserk and begins to wreck the city, so Cream and Cheese have to destroy him.

Later, two government physicists show up at Chris' mansion to announce that the animals' world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, and the only way to stop it is to send the animals back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport the animals back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all of the animals but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide. Sonic is understanding, and Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. With Chris' approval, Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.

Season three begins six months later. A race of villainous robots known as the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he scatters them across the galaxy. Meanwhile on Earth, where [[time dilation|six years have passed]] and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device to return to the animals' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, the Blue Typhoon. On the Typhoon, they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and "Planet Eggs" (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Eggman joins the Metarex shortly after. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love. Later, Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and releases him. At one point, he saves Chris from the Metarex before disappearing, but he reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an unwitting spy ever since. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely [[deafblindness|destroy her sight and hearing]] forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway, but Tails refuses, so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.

The heroes find the Chaotix and Shadow, and everyone heads to the center of the universe, where the Metarex are ominously controlling a planet that is made of water and contains a Planet Egg. After Sonic almost drowns in it, the planet begins turning into a giant seed; the Metarex reveal that, because they have lost the battle, they will destroy the galaxy with this planet. Cosmo sees a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] from her mother Earthia, telling her that she must sacrifice herself to save the rest. She fuses with the giant seed and instructs Tails to use the Blue Typhoon's cannon to fire Super Sonic and Super Shadow at her and the seed and destroy them. He does, in tears the whole time, and annihilates the Metarex. Back on the animals' world, Sonic and Shadow reappear and solemnly inform Tails that they could not revive Cosmo and only found a seed of hers; Cream and Amy try to cheer him up. With a change of heart, Eggman builds a device for Chris to return home but promptly reverts to his old ways after Chris leaves. The series ends with Cosmo's seed sprouting and Chris returning home.

==History==

===Creation and development===
[[File:Sonic X scene.png|thumb|left|This scene shows (clockwise from top left) Sonic, Tails, and two original major characters<U+2014>Cosmo and Chris<U+2014>in the typical outer-space setting.]]
The show was created by [[TMS Entertainment]].<ref name="credits"/><ref name="them"/> It was the first [[anime]] series based on the ''Sonic'' universe. It was primarily influenced by other anime rather than work from the West, where ''Sonic'' was also popular, and was created for a Japanese audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5387184/why-sega-handed-sonic-over-to-western-studios-and-gave-him-a-scarf|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|title=Why Sega handed Sonic over to Western studios and gave him a scarf|date=February 6, 2014|last=Corriea|first=Alexa Ray|accessdate=July 7, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFDx3LWB|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Yuji Naka]], then the head of [[Sonic Team]], filled in as executive producer, and [[Yuji Uekawa]] created all of the original characters.<ref name="credits"/>
Most of the series consists of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined [[CGI animation|CGI]] elements for things such as Sonic's homing attack.<ref name="them"/>

Two trailers for the series were produced. The first was developed before Cheese had been given a name in ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]'' (2002); it referred to Cheese simply as "Chao". It was made up largely of footage that would later appear in the series' intro, but also of unused scenes featuring unique anthropomorphic animals.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7AqlIp5evA|medium=YouTube|year=2002|accessdate=July 16, 2014|title=Sonic|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SGu321Po|archivedate=September 1, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> Sega showed off the second, which was narrated in Japanese, at its booth at the World Hobby Fair video gaming event in February 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-nextlevel.com/features/world_hobby_fair_2003/|publisher=The Next Level|date=February 19, 2003|title=Event Report: World Hobby Fair 2003|accessdate=July 16, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFE4Z5xz|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> It consisted mostly of scenes from the first few episodes, followed by introductions to the main characters. However, it also showed a still frame of a silver anthropomorphic hedgehog (not identified as [[Silver the Hedgehog]]) who never appeared in the series.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpfje29rqqU|medium=YouTube|year=2003|accessdate=July 16, 2014|title=<U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>X|language=Japanese|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SGu5hUHI|archivedate=September 1, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Several of the Japanese performers had voiced their characters in the games, but they were also given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress [[Sanae Kobayashi]] was not sure she would be able to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. [[Chikao <U+014C>tsuka]], who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and <U+014C>tsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.<ref name="jpint">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030818220841/http://www.lycos.co.jp/anime/story.html?q=21nttpubn10|publisher=Lycos|title=<U+4E16><U+754C><U+6700><U+901F><U+306E><U+9752><U+3044><U+30CF><U+30EA><U+30CD><U+30BA><U+30DF><U+3001><U+30D3><U+30C7><U+30AA><U+30EA><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30B9><U+6C7A><U+5B9A><U+FF01><U+3000><U+3053><U+306E><U+79CB><U+306B><U+306F><U+4E16><U+754C><U+30C7><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+3060><U+FF01>|language=Japanese|url=http://www.lycos.co.jp/anime/story.html?q=21nttpubn10|date=June 21, 2003|archivedate=August 18, 2003|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>

Sonic Team head [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]] believed that ''Sonic X'' and its merchandise, along with the game ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', had helped expose the ''Sonic'' franchise to a new generation of potential gamers in 2003, and he dubbed it a "Sonic Year" as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/afterthoughts-sonic-heroes|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|title=Afterthoughts: Sonic Heroes|date=2004|accessdate=September 15, 2014|archivedate=June 29, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ScIDWzo4}}</ref> More boldly, Naka hoped that ''Sonic X'' alone would cause the popularity of the ''Sonic'' series to skyrocket, as that of the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon (video game series)|Pok<U+00E9>mon]]'' series did after its [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|anime adaptation]] was first released.<ref name="pokemon">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-to-begin-major-sonic-promotion/1100-6023404/|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 18, 2003|title=Sega to begin major Sonic promotion|last=Niizumi|first=Hirohiko|accessdate=July 16, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFE9BL1Y|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Broadcast and localization===
[[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] handled the show's American localization. The episodes were [[Editing of anime in American distribution|heavily edited for content and length]]; 4Kids has been described by [[Destructoid]] as being "infamous" among anime fans for this type of overzealous editing. 4Kids removed alcohol consumption and coarse language, instances of breaking the [[fourth wall]], and numerous romantic scenes.<ref name="negativity"/> Unlike some other series that 4Kids translated around the early- to mid-2000s, such as ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'', ''Sonic X'' suffered no full episodes being cut. Producer Michael Haigney personally disliked realistic violence in children's programs, but had not intended to make massive changes himself. Instead, he was bound by [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s strict guidelines, which forbid content such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and strong violence. In 2006, near the end of the show's American production, Haigney stated in an interview that he had never played a ''Sonic'' game, read the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comics]], or watched any of the previous ''Sonic'' animated series.<ref name="producer">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070217075303/http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/anime-articles/80|url=http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/anime-articles/80|publisher=Anime Boredom|title=mr. michael haigney interview (4kids)|date=February 12, 2006|last=Rasmussen|first=David|accessdate=April 30, 2014|archivedate=February 17, 2007}}</ref>

[[Archie Comics]], publisher of the main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' comics, started a ''Sonic X'' series in 2005. It was originally set to run for only four issues, but was extended to 40 issues due to high demand. The last issue was released in December 2008, and it kicked off the ''[[Sonic Universe]]'' arc of the comics. The comics were written by [[Ian Flynn]], who also authors the main ''Sonic'' comics.<ref name="last">{{cite comic|title=Sonic X|publisher=[[Archie Comics]]|issue=40|date=December 2008|page=p. 26}}.</ref>

While the comics are set during the ''Sonic X'' timeline, their plot is original.

Eggman enacts more malicious schemes based on holidays like [[Christmas]],<ref>{{cite comic|title=Sonic X|publisher=Archie Comics|issue=15|date=November 2006}}.</ref> [[Valentine's Day]],<ref>{{cite comic|title=Sonic X|publisher=Archie Comics|issue=16|date=December 2006}}.</ref> and [[St. Patrick's Day]],<ref>{{cite comic|title=Sonic X|publisher=Archie Comics|issue=17|date=January 2007}}.</ref> Afterwards, he temporarily fires Decoe and Bocoe and creates replacements, Dukow and Bukow,<ref>{{cite comic|title=Sonic X|publisher=Archie Comics|issue=22|date=June 2007}}.</ref> who kidnap Sonic and give him to an organization called S.O.N.I.C.X.

===Video games===
In 2003, [[McDonald's]] packaged five different single-button [[dedicated console]] games, mostly based on various sports, with [[Happy Meal]]s to promote ''Sonic X'': two featuring Sonic and one each for Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow. Another Happy Meal game based on Big the Cat fishing arrived the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesasylum.com/2013/04/17/gaming-happy-meals-a-grease-covered-history/|publisher=Games Asylum|last=Gander|first=Matt (of [[Retro Gamer]])|date=April 17, 2013|title=The history of fast-food freebies|accessdate=June 24, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFFW8D2e|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[LeapFrog Enterprises]] released a ''Sonic X'' [[educational entertainment|educational]] math game for its [[Leapster]] handheld game console; it was released in 2005 in North America<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, North American) boxart.</ref> and 2007 in Europe.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, European) boxart.</ref> The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced [[platform game|platform]]/[[action game|action]] game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction).<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 2<U+2013>3.</ref> There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 4<U+2013>6.</ref>

===Trading card game===
[[Score Entertainment]] created a ''Sonic X'' [[collectible card game]] for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with ''Sonic'' characters than like a wholly ''Sonic''-based product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review|publisher=KidzWorld|title=Sonic X Card Game Review|accessdate=June 24, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SGuKKNT6|archivedate=September 1, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''Sonic X'' has had a middling reception; Conrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its "horrible localization" as a main reason for negativity.<ref name="negativity">{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=April 4, 2010|accessdate=April 6, 2014|title=Watch Sonic X on Hulu This Easter|last=Zimmerman|first=Conrad|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFFaH1ox|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: "It's really annoying how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers."<ref name="them">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355|publisher=THEM Anime|last=Jones|first=Tim|title=Sonic X|accessdate=April 6, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFFevPNa|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> Other comments on the show's aesthetics, were mostly positive. Staff of [[GamesRadar]] admitted, "At least the song fits. Can't imagine Sonic listening to ''[[Sonic Underground|Underground]]''{{'}}s wailing [[Meat Loaf]] [[soft rock|light rock]], but he'd definitely jam to ''Sonic X''."<ref name="gamesradar"/> Jones praised the [[rock music|rock]] music from ''Sonic Adventure 1'' and ''2'', as well as the "pretty piano music" and "catchy" Japanese intro and outro themes. He also found the backgrounds "nice to look at" but did not like the use of CGI for Sonic's homing attack.<ref name="them"/>

The human characters<U+2014>and, to a lesser extent, the animal ones<U+2014>were also criticized. Jones decried Chris as "a dull, boring, uninspired character" and also described Tanaka and Ella as "bland" stereotypes of [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|Japanese-]] and [[Stereotypes of African Americans|African-Americans]], respectively. Jones also criticized the presence of Amy and Big, but took particular issue to the show's portrayal of Sonic, which he summarized as: "'I'm gonna run around downtown until something exciting happens and use a stinking [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Rings|Ring]] to defeat my enemies'".<ref name="them"/> GamesRadar bemoaned both the "piss-poor ''Adventure'' characters" and the original human ones.<ref name="gamesradar">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|author=GamesRadar_US|date=June 23, 2012|title=The absolute worst Sonic moments|accessdate=April 6, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFFl75cB|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> In contrast, writer Gaz Plant of NintendoLife opined that "one of the key successes" of the series was its incorporation of numerous characters from the games, including lesser-used ones like Big and the Chaotix. Fans were divided on the merit of the Thorndykes.<ref name="nintendolife">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/10/feature_a_supersonic_history_of_sonic_cartoons|publisher=NintendoLife|date=October 18, 2013|title=Feature: A Supersonic History of Sonic Cartoons|accessdate=July 16, 2014|last=Plant|first=Gaz|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFFnwPGX|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The show was well received for faithfully following the format of the games. ''[[Famitsu]]'' offered a uniformly positive review before the first episode broadcast in 2003, commending the skillful transition of the games' speed and style to animation, and expected the series to continue to grow more interesting.<ref name="famguy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1139336_1124.html|work=[[Famitsu]]|title=<U+30A2><U+30CB><U+30E1><U+300E><U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>X<U+300F><U+306E><U+5236><U+4F5C><U+767A><U+8868><U+4F1A><U+304C><U+958B><U+50AC><U+FF01>|date=March 18, 2003|language=Japanese|accessdate=April 28, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFFsq5el|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> Plant stated that "where ''Sonic X'' truly succeeded was in its retelling of iconic stories".<ref name="nintendolife"/> Independent of the characters involved, GamesRadar appreciated the idea of following "Sonic's core concept."<ref name="gamesradar"/> The original storylines were also well received. Amidst his criticism of most of the show, Jones praised the first episode in general, especially its humor.<ref name="them"/> Plant acclaimed the character development that built on the stories of the original games, especially Sonic's and Amy's relationship and the Chaotix's newfound viability as comedy devices. Concurrently, he found the show "surprisingly touching", particularly in its "emotional" final climax, and favorably compared the space exploration of season three to ''[[Star Trek]]''.<ref name="nintendolife"/> ''Famitsu''{{'}}s first preview called the story {{nihongo|profound|<U+91CD><U+539A>|j<U+016B>k<U+014D>}}.<ref name="famguy1"/>

[[Common Sense Media]] gave it three stars out of five and, while not commenting further on its quality, stated that it was appropriate for grade-school children but that some violent scenes were inadvisable for younger viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/sonic-x|publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]|title=Common Sense Media says: Hedgehog and human join together to battle evil.|accessdate=June 24, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFEik2Sf|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> A second ''Famitsu'' review from later in 2003 called the anime an outstanding success and encouraged readers to tune in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1140433_1124.html|work=Famitsu|title=<U+300E><U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF> X<U+300F><U+30A2><U+30D5><U+30EC><U+30B3><U+73FE><U+5834><U+3092><U+6F5C><U+5165><U+53D6><U+6750><U+FF01>|date=June 19, 2003|language=Japanese|accessdate=April 28, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SFEoI3Hc|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>
