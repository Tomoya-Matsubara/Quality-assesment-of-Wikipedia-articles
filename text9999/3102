== Plot ==

The story is centered on Olivia, an actress in her late twenties who has recently broken up with her boyfriend Mauro, a theatre director. But despite the breakup, Olivia accepts a part in a play directed by Mauro. Things do not go well, either in her life or in the play, where she is unable to achieve what a demanding Mauro is asking of her.<ref>[http://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film584436.html I Am Not Lorena at Film affinity] Film Affinity 2014, retrieved on December 16, 2014</ref>

Things get worse when Olivia starts to receive an increasing number of harassing phone calls. She has been mistaken for Lorena Ruiz, a woman with lots of debts whose creditors will not believe they have got the wrong person. The harassment continues, and the case of mistaken identity becomes a living Kafkaesque nightmare for Olivia as she searches for the mysterious Lorena Ruiz.

Director Isidora Marras was inspired by a case of mistaken identity that she herself suffered. The film is the portrait of a bureaucratic and dehumanised system where people are no more than consumers.<ref>[http://www.sanfic.com/pelicula/no-soy-lorena/ SANFIC] SANFIC 10th - 2014, retrieved in December 16, 2014</ref>
