The Almonte Detachment was a military-operated radio communications receiver station linked by land line to [[CFS Carp]] located off Lanark Country Road 49 East of [[Almonte, Ontario]].  A second antenna reciever site was located further East near [[Dunrobin, Ontario]]; the [[CFS Carp Dunrobin Detachment|Dunrobin Detachment]].  The detachment was unmanned and the location primarily used as a remote antenna farm.  After the end of the [[Cold War]], [[CFS Carp]] was decomissioned and the antenna site was no longer needed.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.militarybruce.com/history/base-history_13.html | title = A Short History of Abandoned and Downsized Canadian Military Bases | accessdate = 2013-06-02 | last = Forsyth | first = Bruce | quote = A two-story communications bunker was also constructed near Perth (Richardson Detachment), which was staffed exclusively by members of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (RCCS), later 701 Communications Squadron post-Unification. }}</ref><ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.rcsigs.ca/ViewUnit/59/ | title = CFS Carp - Units | accessdate = 2013-06-02 | quote = CFS Carp was to provide the administration, security and housekeeping services needed to maintain a constant state of operational readiness for all sites under its command; most importantly, the communication facilities at Carp, Richardson, Almonte and Dunrobin}}</ref>
