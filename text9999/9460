"'''Don't Tell Me'''" is the second single by [[United States|American]] singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from her 8th studio album ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' and was released on [[November 21]], [[2000]] by [[Maverick Records]]. The release date in [[North America]] was postponed to [[January 16]], [[2001]] due to the huge success of the first single "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]".{{Fact|date=August 2008}} . The single sold around 4.5 million copies till date.

==Song information==
The track was written by [[Joe Henry]], Madonna's brother-in-law.  He recorded the track on its own, simply called "Stop", which was released on his 2001 album ''Scar''. His wife, Melanie, sent a [[demo (music)|demo]] of the track to her sister, who recorded her own version with the help of [[Mirwais Ahmadza<U+00EF>]]. Singer [[Lizz Wright]] recorded a jazzy take on "Stop" which she included in her 2005 release "Dreaming Wide Awake".

Madonna performed "Don't Tell Me" on her 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] and her 2004 [[Re-Invention Tour]].

In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all-time by '''''Q-Magazine'''''. "Don't Tell Me" was allocated the #13 spot.

In 2005, the song placed at #285 on Blender Magazine's "The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born". [http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1756]

== Chart performance ==
"Don't Tell Me" peaked at number four on the U.S. charts and spent eight weeks in the top ten. It made gains at radio for three months consecutively (her longest-growing hit since "[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]"), and also spent a long time on the club-play chart. Despite spending only one week at number one (most of her recent dance hits have spent at least two, and "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]" five), it managed fourteen weeks on the chart, out-lasting "Music" and tying with "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]" as Madonna's longest running club hit since "[[Bedtime Story (song)|Bedtime Story]]" in 1995. In addition, "Don't Tell Me" is Madonna's biggest hit on the Adult Top 40 chart, where it peaked at number four, making it her only top five single on that chart. Charting at #10 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, it was Madonna's last Top 10 hit on the chart to date.

Many fans hoped the single would hit #1 in the US and felt that [[Warner Brothers]] had ruined the single's chances of becoming a #1 hit due to it being released so late. Some believe if it had been released just a couple weeks earlier it would hit the top spot with its strong airplay and sales. But since "[[What It Feels Like For A Girl]]" was released so soon after radio turned their focus to the latest Madonna single which left "Don't Tell Me" to fall on the charts before hitting #1.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

In March 2001 the single was certified gold. With this twenty-fourth gold record, Madonna tied with [[The Beatles]] for the second spot of most gold records in the [[United States]].

The song was also a huge hit around the world, peaking in the top five in many countries. It hit the number one spot in [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Ireland]] and [[South Africa]], remaining at #1 for 3 weeks in the latter two countries.  It also reached the number four slot in the [[United Kingdom]]. The single is often referred to as one of the most successful Madonna singles in Ireland.

==Music video==
[[Image:Donttellmemusicvideo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Madonna in "Don't Tell Me" video flanked by the cowboys.]]The [[music video]] for "Don't Tell Me" was directed by [[Jean-Baptiste Mondino]] and filmed in [[October 2000]]. The choreography was done by [[Alex Magno (choreographer)|Alex Magno]], who also collaborated on the [[Drowned World Tour]]. The tour designers [[Dsquared]] and Arianne Phillips also designed her cowgirl costume in the video. the video featured Madonna walking down an automated walk-way in front of a screen. Cowboys played on sand in the video played on the screen. Later they joined Madonna on the walk-way in a choreographed dance routine.

==Legacy==
At the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] as hosted by [[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]], a parody of the song (and video) were performed by the hosts, as they detailed the anticipated events of the evening. Fallon at one time dropped to the floor to bathe himself in sand, a la Madonna in the video.  Fallon, however, got most of it in his pants.

Rock band [[The Androids]] recorded a song entitled "Do it With Madonna," where they detail how they would prefer [[sex]] with the titular star as opposed to more recently unveiled [[pop music|pop]] idols.  One citation they make to Madonna's appeal is a music video in which she's wearing a "cowboy hat and [...] kicking the dirt", a clear reference to the video for "Don't Tell Me".
