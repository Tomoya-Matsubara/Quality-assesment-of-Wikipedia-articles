'''Richard Robert Volk''' (born March 15, 1945) is a former [[American football]] player who played for the [[Baltimore Colts]], [[New York Giants]], and [[Miami Dolphins]]. He retired with 38 career interceptions and 13 fumble recoveries, and totaled 574 yards on interception returns and 548 yards on punt returns.

Volk played [[college football]] for the [[University of Michigan]] from 1964 to 1966 and was a member of the [[1964 Michigan Wolverines football team|1964 team]] that won the [[Big Ten Conference]] championship and defeated [[1964 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] in the [[1965 Rose Bowl]]. He played as a [[defensive back]] for Michigan's defensive unit and as a [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] and [[quarterback]] for the offensive unit.  Volk was also selected by the [[Sporting News]] as a first-team [[All-American]] in 1967. In 1989, he was inducted into the [[University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor]]; Volk and [[Ron Johnson (running back)|Ron Johnson]] were the first two football players from the 1960s to be so honored.

Volk went on to a successful 12-year career as a [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] in the [[National Football League]]. He played nine years with the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts#NFL Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] from 1967 to 1975. He was a member of the Colts' teams that lost [[Super Bowl III]] to the [[New York Jets]] and won [[Super Bowl V]] against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Volk was selected as an NFL All-Pro four times (1968&ndash;1971) and played in three [[Pro Bowl]]s (1967, 1969, 1971). After being released by the Colts in April 1976, Volk concluded his playing career with the [[New York Giants]] in 1976 and the [[Miami Dolphins]] from 1977 to 1978. In 1977, Volk was selected by Baltimore fans as a starter for the Colts' 25th anniversary team.

==Early years==
Volk was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], in 1945.  He attended [[Wauseon High School]] in [[Wauseon, Ohio]], where he was a three-sports star. He was an all-league basketball and baseball player and also played quarterback on the football team.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jim Weeks|title=Lima, Shawnee At BG Tonight|newspaper=[[The Lima News]]|date=March 15, 1963}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Chuck Dell|title=Spartans Win District|date=March 17, 1963|newspaper=The Lima News}}</ref><ref name=Chap/>

==University of Michigan==
Volk enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] was influenced by family ties, including [[Bob Chappuis]], who was Volk's uncle and finished second in the [[Heisman Trophy]] voting while playing for the undefeated [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Wolverines]]. Volk noted:<blockquote>"I had all these stories growing up. He [Bob Chappuis] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like [[Woody Hayes|Woody [Hayes]]] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, if I could just sit on the bench, that's all I care about.'"<ref name=Raven/></blockquote>

At Michigan, Volk was a three-year starter from 1964 to 1966. Prior to the start of the 1964 season, he was given jersey no. 49, the same number worn by his uncle when he played for Michigan.<ref name=Chap>{{cite news|title=Volk Is Nephew Of Former U-M All-American Chappuis|newspaper=The Evening News (AP story)|date=October 20, 1964}}</ref>  During the 1964 season, Volk played at the [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] position on both offense and defense and also served as a backup at quarterback to [[Bob Timberlake (football player)|Bob Timberlake]].

Volk was invited to play on the College All-Star team following his senior year. At the camp for the All-Star team, he was rated by the scouts as "the best all-around athlete among the high-priced talent preparing for pro debuts."<ref name=NEA/>

==Professional football==
===Baltimore Colts===
Volk played as a [[Safety (football position)|free safety]] for twelve seasons in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. He was selected four times as an NFL All-Pro (1968-1971) and played three times in the [[Pro Bowl]] (1967, 1969, 1971).<ref name=PFR>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/V/VolkRi00.htm|title=Rick Volk Statistics|publisher=www.pro-football-reference.com|accessdate=October 4, 2010}}</ref>  Volk also played in the [[Super Bowl]] twice for the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] as a member of the [[Super Bowl III]] team and the [[Super Bowl V]] winning team.  

He made a name for himself as a rookie in 1967 by recovering an onside kick to help the Colts defeat the Packers.  He also set a Colts team record for the longest interception runback with a 94-yard touchdown return against Chicago in November 1967.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rick Volk picked up by Denver|newspaper=THE MORNING HERALD, HAGERSTOWN, MD|date=May 12, 1976}}</ref> Volk's interception of the pass intended for [[Brian Piccolo]] was his third interception in four games.

Volk was knocked unconscious during Super Bowl III when he collided helmet-to-helmet with Jets fullback [[Matt Snell]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Cameron C.

In 1970, Volk helped lead the Colts to another Super Bowl appearance, but were now representing the AFC following the merger of the two leagues (NFL and AFL) that year.  This time, the Colts defeated the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[Super Bowl V]].  Volk was responsible for covering [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs [[Bob Hayes]] and [[Mike Ditka]] in the Super Bowl,<ref>{{cite news|author=Tony Petrella|title=Volk: 'Dallas Is Good, but We're Better'|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=January 9, 1971|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=joIyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dLcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4952,3509188&dq=rick-volk&hl=en}}</ref> and he played a key role in the Colts' victory.  In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 13&ndash;6.  Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback [[Craig Morton]] at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown.<ref>{{cite news|title=Colts Are Champs On O'Brien's FG|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=January 18, 1971}}</ref><ref name="rvklingaman">[http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/thetoydepartment/2009/12/catching_up_with_former_colt_r_4.html Klingaman, Mike.

Simon and Schuster, 1990 ISBN 0-671-72798-2</ref>  Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore.  He recalled team owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: "The next day we all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family <U+2013> my wife and one kid, at the time. I remember we were on the beach, [[Tom Mitchell (American football)|Tom Mitchell]] and I, and we got the paper to make sure it was really true - that we did win. Because this was like a dream come true on the sand beaches in the Bahamas."<ref name=Raven/>

Volk had his best season in 1971 when he was picked as a first-team NFL All-Pro by the Associated Press, Pro Football Writers, and the Newspaper Ent. Association.<ref name=PFR/>  He remained with Colts for nine years and was one of the last players from the Super Bowl V champions to remain with the team.  In 1974, one Maryland sports writer noted that Volk remained a solid performer: "Although the Colts suffered through an overall dismal campaign in 1973, Volk remained one of the few solid performers in an otherwise lackluster season."<ref>{{cite news|author=Larry Yanos|title=Colt Corral Honoring Volk|newspaper=The Daily Mail, Hagerstown, Maryland|date=February 6, 1974}}</ref>  In June 1975, Volk prepared for his ninth season with the Colts as one columnist wrote:<blockquote>"Rick Volk has seen both ends of the rainbow in his tenure with the Baltimore Colts. The personable veteran defensive back has known the sweet taste of success, attested by the Super Bowl ring he often wears, and also has survived the agony of defeat <U+2014> especially after people like Don Shula, John Unitas, Bubba Smith and Tom Matte were no longer wanted or appreciated in the Monumental City."<ref>{{cite news|author=Larry Yanos|title=Rick Volk rarin' to go|newspaper=The Daily Mail, Hagerstown, Maryland|date=June 17, 1975}}</ref></blockquote>

Volk was placed on waivers by the Colts in April 1977;<ref>{{cite news|title=Colts place Rick Volk on waivers|newspaper=The Sun, Baltimore, Md.|date=April 28, 1976}}</ref> he was picked up by the [[Denver Broncos]] one week later.

In October 1977, Volk was selected as a starter on the Colts' 25th anniversary team.  The team was selected by the fans in Baltimore, and the only players at any position to receive more votes than Volk were David Lee, [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Raymond Berry]], [[Alan Ameche]], [[Gino Marchetti]], [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]], [[Mike Curtis (American football)|Mike Curtis]], [[Art Donovan]], [[Alex Sandusky]], [[Jim Parker (American football)|Jim Parker]] and [[Bobby Boyd]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Colts lead best balloting|newspaper=Evening Capital|date=October 27, 1977}}</ref>

===New York Giants===
Volk was cut by the Broncos in August 1976 and signed by the [[Miami Dolphins]] two weeks later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Volk signs with Dolphins |newspaper=THE NEWS, Frederick, Md.|date=August 30, 1976}}</ref> He did not play for the Dolphins in 1976 and was signed mid-season by the [[New York Giants]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Football transactions|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=October 15, 1976}}</ref>  Volk played in 8 games for the Giants in 1976 and tallied 2 interceptions and a fumble recovery.<ref name=PFR/> Volk was cut by the Giants in early September 1977, shortly before the start of the regular season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Transactions|newspaper=Evening Capital, Annapolis, Maryland|date=September 9, 1977}}</ref>  Volk recalled the disappointment at being cut by the Giants at age 32: "I felt I should have been in New York, but they went with younger people.  I was very disappointed, especially to get cut at the end of training camp.  I'd done all the hard training and was ready for the season &ndash; the fun time."<ref name=Troup/> He returned to his home in Baltimore and worked during the fall as a manufacturer's representative.<ref name=Troup/>

===Miami Dolphins===
Volk signed with the [[Miami Dolphins]] for the final month of the [[1977 NFL season]].<ref name=Troup/>  He played in three games for the [[1977 Miami Dolphins season|1977 Miami Dolphins]] and had one interception (off [[Buffalo Bills]] quarterback [[Joe Ferguson]]).<ref name=PFR/>  Miami head coach [[Don Shula]], who had worked with Volk in Baltimore, said, "We got him in the last four games, and he showed us some great hitting.  He also didn't seem to have lost any speed."<ref name=Troup/>

During the [[1978 NFL season]], Volk appeared in all 16 games for the Dolphins, 13 of them as a starter.  Volk started the season strong, intercepting a pass in the season opener against the [[New York Jets]].  In the second game of the season, the Dolphins played the Colts in Baltimore.  Volk intercepted two passes against Baltimore quarterback [[Bill Troup]] and helped the Dolphins to a 42&ndash;0 win.  After the game, Volk told reporters, "I wanted to have a good game in Baltimore, and I couldn't have asked for anything better than the way it turned out."<ref name=Troup>{{cite news|author=Dan Sewell|title=Dolphins' Rick Volk is full of optimism|newspaper=Boca Raton News (AP story)|date=September 13, 1978|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DAwRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wowDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6967,2234082&dq=rick-volk&hl=en}}</ref>  While Volk began the 1978 season as a starter, he was replaced by [[Charlie Babb]] for the final four games.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rick Volk to hang up cleats|newspaper=Pacific Stars & Stripes|date=December 29, 1978}}</ref>  After the Dolphins lost the AFC wildcard game to the Oilers, Volk announced his retirement. Volk told reporters he had wanted to end his career with a championship team and added, "When the game's over, you can't worry about it.  For most of the guys, there'll be another season. For me, this is it."<ref>{{cite news|title=Dolphin Rick Volk announces retirement|newspaper=The Paris News, Paris, Texas (AP story)|date=December 27, 1978}}</ref>

==Later years==
Volk began working as a manufacturer's representative while still playing football, and continued in that business after retiring from the game.
