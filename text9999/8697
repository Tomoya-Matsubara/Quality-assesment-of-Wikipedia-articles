The '''{{IAST|Upani<U+1E63>had}}s''' ({{lang-sa|<U+0909><U+092A><U+0928><U+093F><U+0937><U+0926><U+094D>}}, {{IPA-sa|up<U+0259>ni<U+0282><U+0259>d|IPA}}) are philosophical texts of the [[Hindu]] religion. More than 200 are known, of which the first dozen or so, the oldest and most important, are variously referred to as the principal, main (''[[mukhya]]'') or old {{IAST|Upanishads}}. The oldest of these, the ''Brihadaranyaka'' and ''Chandogya'' {{IAST|Upanishads}}, were composed during the pre-Buddhist era of [[India]],{{sfn|Olivelle|p=xxxvi|1998}}{{sfn|King|Acarya|p=52|1995}}{{#tag:ref|The date of the Buddha's birth and death are uncertain: most early 20th-century historians dated his lifetime as [[circa|c.]] 563 BCE to 483 BCE,{{sfn|Cousins|1996|pp=57-63}} but more recent opinion dates his death to between to between 486 and 483 BCE or, according to some, between 411 and 400 BCE.{{sfn|Narain|2003|p=}}|group=note}} while the ''Taittiriya, Aitareya'' and ''Kausitaki'', which show Buddhist influence, must have been composed after the fifth century BC:{{sfn|King|Acarya|p=52|1995}} the remainder of the mukhya Upanishads are dated to the first two centuries of the common era.{{sfn|King|Acarya|p=52|1995}} The new {{IAST|Upanishads}} were composed in the [[medieval]] and early modern period: discoveries of newer {{IAST|Upanishads}} were being reported as late as 1926.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=12}} One, the ''{{IAST|[[Muktika]]}}'' Upanishad, predates 1656{{sfn|Verma|2009}} and contains a list of 108 canonical {{IAST|Upanishads}},{{sfn|Sen|1937|p=19}} including itself as the last. However, several texts under the title of "Upanishads" originated right up to the first half of the 20th century, some of which did not deal with subjects of vedic philosophy.{{sfn|Varghese|2008|p=101}} The newer {{IAST|Upanishads}} are known to be imitations of the mukhya {{IAST|Upanishads}}.

The Upanishads have been attributed to several authors: Yajnavalkya and Uddalaka Aruni feature prominently in the early Upanishads.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|pp59-60}} Other important writers include Shwetaketu, Shandilya, Aitreya, Pippalada and Sanat Kumara. Important women authors include Yajnavalkya's wife Maitreyi, and Gari. [[Dara Shikoh]], son of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], translated 50 {{IAST|Upanishads}} into [[Persian language|Persian]] in 1657. The first written English translation came in 1804 from [[Max M<U+00FC>ller]], who was aware of 170 {{IAST|Upanishads}}. Sadhale's catalog from 1985, the {{IAST|''Upani<U+1E63>ad-v<U+0101>kya-mah<U+0101>-ko<U+015B>a''}}, lists 223 {{IAST|Upanishads}}.{{sfn|Sadhale|1987}} The {{IAST|Upanishads}} are mostly the concluding part of the [[Brahmanas]], and the transition from the latter to the former is identified as the ''[[Aranyakas]]''.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=56}}

All Upanishads have been passed down in [[oral tradition]]. The mukhya Upanishads hold the stature of revealed texts (''[[shruti]]''). With the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Brahmasutra]],{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=205}} the mukhya {{IAST|Upanishads}} provide a foundation for several later schools of [[India]]n philosophy (''vedanta''), among them, two influential [[monism|monistic]] schools of Hinduism.{{#tag:ref|Advaita Vedanta'', generally attributed to Shankara (788<U+2013>820), advances a non-dualistic (''a-dvaita'') interpretation of the Upanishads."{{sfn|Cornille|1992|p=12}}|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|"These Upanishadic ideas are developed into Advaita monism. Brahman's unity comes to be taken to mean that appearances of individualities.{{sfn|Phillips|1995|p=10}}|group=note}}  {{#tag:ref|"The doctrine of advaita (non dualism) has is origin in the Upanishads."{{sfn|Marbaniang|2010|p=91}}|group=note}} The {{IAST|Upanishads}} are collectively considered amongst the [[100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]] by the British poet [[Martin Seymour-Smith]]. The texts have received praise from writers and scholars like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Thoreau]], [[Kant]], [[Schopenhauer]] and several others. Some criticism of the Upanishads revolves around the denial of pluralistic ideas due to the core philosophy of unity of the Upanishads.

==Etymology==
The [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|Upani<U+1E63>ad}}'' derives from  ''upa-'' (nearby), ''ni-'' (at the proper place, down) and ''sad'' ("sitting down near"), implying sitting near a teacher to receive instruction{{sfn|Macdonell|2004|p=53}} or, alternatively, "laying siege" to the teacher.{{sfn|Schayer|1925|pp=57<U+2013>67}} [[Monier-Williams]] adds that, "according to native authorities Upanishad means 'setting to rest ignorance by revealing the knowledge of the supreme spirit.'"{{sfn|Monier-Williams|p=201}} A gloss of the term Upanishad based on [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s commentary on the [[Katha Upanishad|{{IAST|Ka<U+1E6D>ha}}]] and {{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}} {{IAST|Upanishads}} equates it with ''<U+0100>tmavidy<U+0101>'', that is, "knowledge of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]]", or ''Brahmavidy<U+0101>'' "knowledge of Brahma". Other dictionary meanings include "esoteric doctrine" and "secret doctrine".{{sfn|M<U+00FC>ller|1900|p=lxxxiii}}

==Classification==
There are more than 200 known ''{{IAST|Upanishads}}'', one of which, the ''{{IAST|Muktika}}'', gives a list of [[108 (number)|108]] ''{{IAST|Upanishads}}'' <U+2013> this number corresponding to the holy Hindu number of beads on a Hindu [[rosary]] or ''[[Hindu prayer beads|mala]]''. Modern scholars recognize the first 10, 11, 12 or 13 ''{{IAST|Upanishads}}'' as principal or ''Mukhya'' {{IAST|Upanishads}} and the remainder as derived from this ancient canon. If a ''Upanishad'' has been commented upon or quoted by revered thinkers like [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], it is a ''Mukhya Upanishad'',{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=56}} accepted as ''[[shruti]]'' by most Hindus.

The new {{IAST|Upanishads}} recorded in the {{IAST|Muktika}} probably originated in southern India,{{sfn|Deussen|1908|pp=35<U+2013>36}} and are grouped according to their subject as ''(S<U+0101>m<U+0101>nya) [[Ved<U+0101>nta]]'' (philosophical), ''[[Yoga]]'', ''[[Sanyasa]]'' (of the life of renuciation), ''[[Vaishnava]]'' (dedicated to the god [[Vishnu]]), ''Saiva'' (dedicated to [[Shiva]]) and ''[[Sakti]]'' (dedicated to the goddess).{{sfn|Varghese|2008|p=131}}  New Upani<U+1E63>ads are often sectarian since sects have sought to legitimize their texts by claiming for them the status of ''[[<U+015A>ruti]]''.{{sfn|Holdrege|1995|pp=426}} 

Another way of classifying the Upanishads is to associate them with the respective [[Brahmana|Brahmanas]].  Of nearly the same age are the Aitareya, Kau<U+1E63><U+012B>taki and Taittir<U+012B>ya Upani<U+1E63>ads, while the remnant date from the time of transition from Vedic to Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Sharma|1985|pp=3, 10-22, 145}}

===Mukhya Upanishads===
{{Main|Mukhya Upanishads}}
The ''Mukhya Upanishads'' can themselves be stratified into periods. Of the early period are the ''{{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}}'' and the ''{{IAST|Chandogya}}'', the most important and the oldest, of which the former is the older of the two, though some parts were composed after the ''Chandogya''.{{#tag:ref|These are believed to pre-date [[Gautam Buddha]] (c.500BC){{sfn|Olivelle|1998|pp=3<U+2013>4}}|group=note}}

The ''Aitareya, Taittiriya, Kausitaki, Mundaka, Prasna'', and ''Kathaka Upani<U+1E63>ads''  show Buddha's influence, and must have been composed after the fifth century BCE. In the first two centuries CE, they were followed by the ''Kena, Mandukya'' and ''Isa Upanishads''.{{sfn|King|1995|p=52}} Not much is known about the authors except those few, like Yajnavalkayva and Uddalaka, mentioned in the texts.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=56}} A few women authors, such as Gargi and Maitreyi, the wife of Yajnavalkayva,{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=61}} also feature occasionally. 

Each of the principal ''{{IAST|Upanishads}}'' can be associated with one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (''[[shakha]]s'').{{sfn|Joshi|1994|pp=90<U+2013>92}} 1,131 Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new ''Upanishads'' often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs from that of the classic ''Upanishads'', being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=85}}

The {{IAST|[[Kau<U+015B><U+012B>t<U+0101>ki]]}} and {{IAST|[[Maitr<U+0101>ya<U+1E47>i]]}} {{IAST|Upanishads}} are sometimes added to the list of the mukhya {{IAST|Upanishads}}.

===New Upanishads===
There is no fixed list of the ''{{IAST|Upanishads}}'' as newer ones have continued to be composed.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=17}} On many occasions, when older ''{{IAST|Upanishads}}'' have not suited the founders of new sects, they have composed new ones of their own.{{sfn|Mueller|1859|p=317}} 1908 marked the discovery of four new {{IAST|Upanishads}}, named ''Bashkala'', ''Chhagaleya'', ''Arsheya'' and ''Saunaka'', by [[Friedrich Schrader|Dr. Friedrich Schrader]],{{sfn|Singh|2002|pp=3<U+2013>4}} who attributed them to the first prose period of the Upanishads.{{sfn|Schrader|Adyar Library|1908|p=v}} The text of three, the ''Chhagaleya, Arsheya'' and ''Saunaka'', was reportedly corrupt and neglected but possibly re-constructable with the help of their Perso-Latin translations. Texts called "Upanishads" continued to appear up to the end of the British rule in 1947. The ''Akbar Upanishad'' and ''Allah Upanishad'' are examples,{{sfn|Varghese|2008|p=101}} having been written in the 17th century, at the instance of Darah Shikoh, in praise of Islam.{{sfn|Walker|1968|p=534}}

The main [[Shaktism|Shakta]] {{IAST|Upanishads}} mostly discuss doctrinal and interpretative differences between the two principal sects of a major [[tantra|Tantric]] form of Shaktism called [[Shri Vidya]] [[upasana]]. The many extant lists of authentic ''Shakta Upani<U+1E63>ads'' vary, reflecting the sect of their compilers, so that they yield no evidence of their "location" in Tantric tradition, impeding correct interpretation. The Tantra content of these texts also weaken its identity as an Upani<U+1E63>ad for non-Tantrikas and therefore, its status as [[shruti]] and thus its authority.{{sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=13<U+2013>14}}

==Philosophy==
[[File:Wassertropfen.jpg|right|thumb|Impact of a drop of water, a common analogy for [[Brahman]] and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|<U+0100>tman]]]]
Two words that are of paramount importance in grasping the {{IAST|Upanishads}} are ''[[Brahman]]'' and ''[[<U+0100>tman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=59}} The Brahman is the universal spirit and the Atman is the individual Self.{{sfn|Smith|1995|p=10}} Differing opinions exist amongst scholars regarding the etymology of these words. Brahman probably comes from the root ''brh'' which means to grow.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=60}} The present day connotation of Brahman is "the source of all existence or from whom the universe has grown". Brahman is the ultimate, both transcendent and immanent, the absolute infinite existence, the sum total of all that ever is, was, or shall be. The word ''atman's'' original meaning was probably "breath" and it now means the soul of a living creature, especially of a human being. The discovery by the Upanashidic thinkers that Atman and Brahman are one and the same is one of the greatest contribution made to the thought of the world.{{sfn|Lanman|1897|p=790}}{{sfn|Brown|1922|p=266}}{{sfn|Slater|1897|p=32}}{{sfn|Varghese|2008|p=132}}

The ''{{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}}'' and the ''{{IAST|Chandogya}}'' are the most important of the mukhya {{IAST|Upanishads}}. They represent two main schools of thought within the {{IAST|Upanishads}}. The {{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}} deals with acosmic or ''nis-prapancha'', whereas the {{IAST|Chandogya}} deals with the cosmic or ''sa-prapancha''.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=56}} Between the two, the {{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}} is considered more original.{{sfn|Parmeshwaranand|2000|p=458}}

The {{IAST|Upanishads}} also contain the first and most definitive explications of the divine syllable [[Aum]], the cosmic vibration that underlies all existence. The [[mantra]] ''Aum Shanti Shanti Shanti'', translated as "the soundless sound, peace, peace, peace", is often found in the {{IAST|Upanishads}}. The path of ''[[bhakti]]'' or "Devotion to God" is foreshadowed in Upanishadic literature, and was later realized by texts such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.{{sfn|Robinson|1992|p=51.}}

===Metaphysics===
The three main approaches in arriving at the solution to the problem of the Ultimate Reality have traditionally been the theological, the cosmological and the psychological approaches.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=247}} The cosmological approach involves looking outward, to the world; the psychological approach meaning looking inside or to the Self; and the theological approach is looking upward or to God. [[Descartes]] takes the first and starts with the argument that the Self is the primary reality, self-consciousness the primary fact of existence, and introspection the start of the real philosophical process.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=248}} According to him, we can arrive at the conception of God only through the Self because it is God who is the cause of the Self and thus, we should regard God as more perfect than the Self. [[Spinoza]] on the other hand, believed that God is the be-all and the end-all of all things, the alpha and the omega of existence. From God philosophy starts, and in God philosophy ends. The manner of approach of the Upanishadic philosophers to the problem of ultimate reality was neither the Cartesian nor Spinozistic. The Upanishadic philosophers regarded the Self as the ultimate existence and subordinated the world and God to the Self. The Self to them, is more real than either the world or God. It is only ultimately that they identify the Self with God, and thus bridge over the gulf that exists between the theological and psychological approaches to reality. They take the cosmological approach to start with, but they find that this cannot give them the solution of the ultimate reality. So, Upanishadic thinkers go back and start over by taking the psychological approach and here again, they cannot find the solution to the ultimate reality. They therefore perform yet another experiment by taking the theological approach. They find that this too is lacking in finding the solution. They give yet another try to the psychological approach, and come up with the solution to the problem of the ultimate reality. Thus, the Upanishadic thinkers follow a cosmo-theo-psychological approach.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=248}} A study of the mukhya Upanishads show that the Upanishadic thinkers progressively build on each others' ideas. They go back and forth and refute improbable approaches before arriving at the solution of the ultimate reality.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|pp=249<U+2013>278}}

===Schools of Vedanta===
[[Image:Adi Shankara.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Adi Shankara|Adi Shankara Bhagavadpada]], expounder of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Works of Adi Shankara|commentator]] (''[[bhashya]]'') on the Upanishads]]
The source for all schools of Ved<U+0101>nta are the three texts <U+2013> the {{IAST|Upanishads}}, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Brahmasutra]]s.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1956|p=272}} Two different types of the non-dual Brahman-Atman are presented in the {{IAST|Upanishads}}:{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=62}}
* The one in which the non-dual Brahman-Atman is the all inclusive ground of the universe and
* The one in which all reality in the universe is but an illusion
The later theistic (''Dvaita'' and ''Visistadvaita'') and absolutist (''Advaita'') schools of Vendanta are made possible because of the difference between these two views. The three main schools of Vedanta are [[Advaita]], [[Dvaita]] and [[Vishishtadvaita]]. Other schools of Vedanta made possible by the {{IAST|Upanishads}} include Nimbarka's ''Dvaitadvaita'', Vallabha's ''Suddhadvaita'' and Chaitanya's ''Acintya Bhedabheda''.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|pp=179<U+2013>182}} The philosopher [[Adi Sankara]] has provided commentaries on 11 [[mukhya]] {{IAST|Upanishads}}.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=63}}

'''[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]]''' is considered the most influential sub-school of the ''Ved<U+0101>nta'' school of Hindu philosophy,{{sfn|Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica}} though it does not represent the mainstream Hindu position.{{sfn|Klostermaier |2007|pp=361<U+2013>363}} Gaudapada was the first person to expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the apparently conflicting statements of the {{IAST|Upanishads}}.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1956|p=273}} Advaita literally means non-duality, and it is a [[monistic]] system of thought.{{sfn|Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica}} It deals with the non-dual nature of the Brahman and the Atman. The Advaita school is said to have been consolidated by [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]. He was a pupil of Gaudapada's pupil. Radhakrishnan believed that Shankara's views of Advaita are straightforward developments of the {{IAST|Upanishads}} and the ''Brahmasutra'' and he offered no innovations to these,{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1956|p=284}} while other scholars found sharp differences between Shankara's writings and the ''Brahmasutra'',{{sfn|King|1999|p=221}}{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=31}} and that there are many ideas in the Upanishads at odds with those of Shankara.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=195}} Gaudapada lived in a time when Buddhism was widely prevalent in India, and he was at times conscious of the similarity between his system to some phases of Buddhist thought.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|1956|p=273}}  His main work is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies.{{sfn|King|1999|p=219}} Towards the end of his commentary on the topic, he clearly said, "This was not spoken by Buddha". Although there are a wide variety of philosophical positions propounded in the {{IAST|Upanishads}}, commentators since [[Adi Shankara]] have usually followed him in seeing [[idealism|idealist]] [[monism]] as the dominant force.{{#tag:ref|The breakdown of the Vedic cults is more obscured by retrospective ideology than any other period in Indian history. It is commonly assumed that the dominant philosophy now became an idealist monism, the identification of atman (self) and Brahman (Spirit), and that this mysticism was believed to provide a way to transcend rebirths on the wheel of karma. This is far from an accurate picture of what we read in the Upanishads. It has become traditional to view the Upanishads through the lens of Shankara's Advaita interpretation. This imposes the philosophical revolution of about 700 C.E. upon a very different situation 1,000 to 1,500 years earlier. Shankara picked out monist and idealist themes from a much wider philosophical lineup.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=195}}|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|In this Introduction I have avoided speaking of 'the philosophy of the upanishads', a common feature of most introductions to their translations. These documents were composed over several centuries and in various regions, and it is futile to try to discover a single doctrine or philosophy in them.{{sfn|Olivelle |1998|p=4}}|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|The Upanishadic age was also characterized by a pluralism of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed 'monistic', others, including the [[Katha Upanishad]], are [[dualistic]].{{sfn|Glucklich|2008|p=70}}|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|The Maitri is one of the Upanishads that inclines more toward dualism, thus grounding classical [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga]], in contrast to the non-dualistic Upanishads eventuating in Vedanta.{{sfn|Fields |2001|p=26}}|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|For instances of Platonic [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the early Upanishads see Randall.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=197<U+2013>198}}|group=note}}

The '''[[Dvaita]]''' school was founded by [[Madhvacharya]]. Born in 1138 near [[Udipi]],{{sfn|Raghavendrachar|1956|p=322}} Dvaita is regarded as the best philosophic exposition of theism.{{sfn|Chari|1956|p=305}} Sharma points out that Dvaita, a term commonly used to designate Madhava's system of philosophy, translates as "dualism" in English. The Western understanding of dualism equates to two independent and mutually irreducible substances. The Indian equivalent of that definition would be ''Samkya Dvaita''.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=1<U+2013>2}} Madhva's Dvaita differs from the Western definition of dualism in that while he agrees to two mutually irreducible substances that constitute reality, he regards only one <U+2013> God, as being independent.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=1<U+2013>2}}

The third school of Vedanta is the '''[[Vishishtadvaita]]''', which was founded by [[Ramanuja]]. Traditional dates of his birth and death are given as 1017 and 1137, though a shorter life span somewhere between these two dates has been suggested. Modern scholars conclude that on the whole, Ramanuja's theistic views may be closer to those of the Upanishads than are Shankara's, and Ramanuja's interpretations are in fact representative of the general trend of Hindu thought. Ramanuja strenuously refuted Shankara's works.{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|pp=361<U+2013>363}} Visistadvaita is a synthetic philosophy of love that tries to reconcile the extremes of the other two monistic and theistic systems of vedanta.{{sfn|Chari|1956|p=305}} It is called Sri-Vaisanavism in its religious aspect. Chari claims that has been misunderstood by its followers as well as its critics. Many, including leading modern proponents of this system, forget that ''jiva'' is a substance as well as an attribute and call this system "qualified non-dualism" or the adjectival monism. While the Dvaita insists on the difference between the Brahman and the Jiva, Visistadvaita states that God is their inner-Self as well as transcendent.

==Development==
===Chronology and geography===
Scholars disagree about the exact dates of the composition of the {{IAST|Upanishads}}. Different researchers have provided different dates for the Vedic and Upanashic eras. Ranade criticizes  Deussen for assuming that the oldest {{IAST|Upanishads}} were written in prose, followed by those that were written in verse and the last few again in prose. He proposes a separate chronology based on a battery of six tests.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|pp=13<U+2013>14}} The tables below summarize some of the prominent work:{{sfn|Sharma|1985|pp=17<U+2013>19}}

[[Image:Ancient india.png|thumb|350px|The [[Mahajanapadas]] were the sixteen most powerful kingdoms and republics of the era, located mainly across the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plains]], however there were a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of [[History of India|Ancient India]].]]
[[Image:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|350px|Map of northern India showing kingdoms in which the oldest Upanishads <U+2013> the Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya were composed. River Indus is shown by it's Sanskrit name ''Sindhu'']]The general area of the composition of the early Upanishads was northern India, the region bounded on the west by the Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges river, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range. There is confidence about the early Upanishads being the product of the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of Kuru-Panchala and Kosala-Videha together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxvii}}
While significant attempts have been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. Yajnavalkya is another individual who features prominently, almost as the personal theologian of Janaka.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxviii}} Brahmins of the central region of Kuru-Panchala rightly considered their land as the place of the best theological and literary activities, since this was the heartland of Brahmanism of the late Vedic period. The setting of the third and the fourth chapters of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishads were probably intended to show that Yajnavalkya of Videha defeated all the best theologians of the Kuru Panchala, thereby demonstrating the rise of Videha as a center of learning. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more Western than an Eastern location, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxix}} The great Kuru-Panchala theologian Uddalaka Aruni who was vilified in the Brihadaranyaka features prominently in the Chandogya Upanishad. Compared to the Principal {{IAST|Upanishads}}, the new {{IAST|Upanishads}} recorded in the {{IAST|Muktika}} belong to an entirely different region, probably southern India, and are considerably relatively recent.{{sfn|Deussen|1908|pp=35<U+2013>36}}

===Development of thought===
While the hymns of  the Vedas emphasize rituals and the Brahmanas serve as a liturgical manual for those Vedic rituals, the spirit of the {{IAST|Upanishads}} is inherently opposed to ritual.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=57}} The older {{IAST|Upanishads}} launch attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual. Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the {{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}} Upanishad. The {{IAST|Chandogya}} {{IAST|Upanishad}} parodies those who indulge in the acts of sacrifice by comparing them with a procession of dogs chanting ''Om! Let's eat. Om! Let's drink''. The Mundaka launches the most scathing attack on the ritual by comparing those who value sacrifice with an unsafe boat that is endlessly overtaken by old age and death.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=57}}

The opposition to the ritual is not explicit all the time. On several occasions the {{IAST|Upanishads}} extend the task of the Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a  philosophical meaning. For example, the {{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}} interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ''ashvamedha'' allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then goes on to say that spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=57}}

In similar fashion, the pattern of reducing the number of gods in the Vedas becomes more emphatic in the {{IAST|Upanishads}}. When Yajnavalkaya is asked how many gods exist, he decrements the number successively by answering thirty-three, six, three,  two, one and a half and finally one. Vedic gods such as  the ''Rudras'', ''Visnu'', ''Brahma'' are gradually subordinated to the supreme, immortal and incorporeal Brahman of the {{IAST|Upanishads}}. In fact [[Indra]] and the supreme deity of the Brahamanas, [[Prajapati]], are made door keepers to the Brahman's residence in the Kausitaki Upanishad.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=57}}

In short, the one reality or ''ekam sat'' of the Vedas becomes the ''ekam eva a-dvitiyam''  or "the one and only and sans a second" in the {{IAST|Upanishads}}.{{sfn|Mahadevan|1956|p=57}}

==Worldwide transmission==
[[image:Schopenhauer(wiki).jpg|left|thumb|The Upanishads impressed Schopenhauer. He called them "the production of the highest human wisdom"]]

Given that Indian [[Brahmin]] [[Clairvoyance|seers]] are reputed to have visited Greece, it may be that the Upanishadic sages influenced [[Ancient Greek philosophy]]. Many ideas in [[Plato's Dialogues]], particularly, have Indian analogues <U+2013> several concepts in the Platonic psychology of reason bear resemblance to the gunas of Indian philosophy. Professor Edward Johns Urwick conjectures that ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' owes several central concepts to Indian influence.{{sfn|Wadia|1956|p=64-65}}{{sfn|Ranade|1925|p=xix}} Garb and West have also concluded that this was due to Indian influence.{{sfn|Chousalkar|p=130}}{{sfn|Urwick|1920|p=14}}

A. R. Wadia dissents in that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in ''this'' life,{{sfn|Wadia|1956|p=64-65}} the primary aim being an ideal state. He later proposed a state less ordered but more practicable and conducive to human happiness. As for the Upanishadic thinkers, their goal was not an ideal state or society, but ''[[moksha]]'' or deliverance from the [[Karma in Hinduism|endless cycle]] of birth and death. Wadia concludes that there was no exchange of information and ideas between Plato and the Upanishadic thinkers: Plato remains Greek and the Indian sages remain Indian.{{sfn|Wadia|1956|p=64-65}}

The {{IAST|Upanishads}} were a part of an [[oral tradition]]. Their study was confined to the higher [[caste]]s of Indian society.{{sfn|Sharma|1985|p=19}} [[Shudra|Sudras]] and women were not given access to them soon after their composition. The {{IAST|Upanishads}} have been translated in to various languages including Persian, Italian, Urdu, French, Latin, German, English, Dutch, Polish, Japanese and Russian.{{sfn|Sharma|1985|p=20}} The [[Moghul]] Emperor [[Akbar|Akbar's]] reign (1556<U+2013>1586) saw the first translations of the {{IAST|Upanishads}} into Persian,{{sfn|M<U+00FC>ller|1900|p=lvii}}{{sfn|Muller|1899|p=204}} and his great-grandson, [[Dara Shikoh]], produced a collection called ''Sirr-e-Akbar'' (The Greatest Mysteries) in 1657, with the help of Sanskrit Pandits of Varansi. Its introduction stated that the {{IAST|Upanishads}} constitute the [[Qur'an]]'s "''Kitab al-maknun''" or ''hidden book''.{{sfn|Mohammada|2007|p=54}}{{sfn|Engineer|2006|p=20}} But Akbar's and Sikoh's translations remained unnoticed in the Western world until 1775.{{sfn|M<U+00FC>ller|1900|p=lvii}}

[[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]], a French Orientalist who had lived in India between 1755 and 1761, received a manuscript of the {{IAST|Upanishads}} in 1775  from [[Guillaume Le Gentil|M. Gentil]], and translated it into French and Latin, publishing the Latin translation in two volumes in 1802<U+2013>1804 as ''Oupneck'hat''.{{sfn|Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|1911}} The French translation was never published.{{sfn|M<U+00FC>ller|1900|p=lviii}} The first German translation appeared in 1832 and Roer's English version appeared in 1853. However, Max Mueller's 1879 and 1884 editions were the first systematic English treatment to include the 12 Principal {{IAST|Upanishads}}.{{sfn|Sharma|1985|pp=20}} After this, the {{IAST|Upanishads}} were rapidly translated into Dutch, Polish, Japanese and Russian.{{sfn|Sharma|1985|p=19-20}}

===Global scholarship and praise===

The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] read the Latin translation and praised the Upanishads in his main work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), as well as in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' (1851).{{sfn|Schopenhauer|Payne|2000|p=395}} He found his own philosophy was in accord with the {{IAST|Upanishads}}, which taught that the individual is a manifestation of the one basis of reality. For Schopenhauer, that fundamentally real underlying unity is what we know in ourselves as "will". Schopenhauer used to keep a copy of the Latin ''Oupnekhet'' by his side and  is said to have commented, "It has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death".{{sfn|Schopenhauer|Payne|2000|p=397}} Another German philosopher, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], praised the mystical and spiritual aspects of the {{IAST|Upanishads}}.{{sfn|Singh|p=456-461|1999}} Schelling and other philosophers associated with [[German idealism]] were dissatisfied with [[Christianity]] as propagated by churches. They were fascinated with the Vedas and the {{IAST|Upanishads}}.{{sfn|Singh|1999|p=456-461}}  In the United States, the group known as the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] were influenced by the German idealists. These Americans, such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], were not satisfied with traditional Christian mythology and therefore embraced Schelling's interpretation of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[Transcendental idealism]], as well as his celebration of the romantic, exotic, mystical aspect of the {{IAST|Upanishads}}. As a result of the influence of these writers, the {{IAST|Upanishads}} gained renown in Western countries.{{sfn|Versluis|1993|pp=69, 76, 95. 106<U+2013>110}} [[Erwin Schr<U+00F6>dinger]], the great quantum physicist said, "The multiplicity is only apparent. This is the doctrine of the {{IAST|Upanishads}}. And not of the {{IAST|Upanishads}} only. The mystical experience of the union with God regularly leads to this view, unless strong prejudices stand in the West."{{sfn|Schr<U+00F6>dinger|1992|p=129}} [[Eknath Easwaran]], in translating the {{IAST|Upanishads}}, articulates how they "form snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness taken at various times by different observers and dispatched with just the barest kind of explanation".{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=9}}

==Criticism of the Upanishads==
[[image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|The Indian constitution of January 26, 1950 outlaws the caste system, a system that finds mention in the Vedas and the Upanishads{{sfn|Ranade|1926|pp=59<U+2013>60}}{{sfn|Chowdhry|1956|p=46}}]]
Criticisms of the {{IAST|Upanishads}} are varied.{{#tag:ref|"...Upanishads can easily hold its own against any similar doctrine even of the most advanced thinker of today, thus nullifying that ill-conceived and half-thought-out bluster of an early European writer on the Upanishads that "they are the work of a rude age...."{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=11}}|group=note}}  An early European writer on the {{IAST|Upanishads}} wrote: {{cquote|They are the work of a rude age, a deteriorated race, and a barbarous and unprogressive community.||author=An early European writer{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=11}}}}

The {{IAST|Brihadaranyaka}} gives an unorthodox explanation of the origin of the caste-system. It says that a similar four-tier caste system existed in heaven which is now replicated on earth.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=59-60}} This has been criticized by the Dalit leader [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]]. He studied the philosophy of the {{IAST|Upanishads}} pragmatically and concluded that they were most ineffective and inconsequential piece of speculation and that they had no effect on the moral and social order of the Hindus.{{sfn|Singh|2000|pp=97}} Ambedkar implies that the voluminous {{IAST|Upanishads}} are a useless work because of their inability to affect any change in the [[caste]]-biased, inherently unequal Hindu society. He dismisses the {{IAST|Upanishads}} by quoting [[Thomas Huxley|Huxley]] in saying that Upanishadic philosophy can be reduced to very few words. Ambedkar agrees with Huxley: {{cquote|In supposing the existence of a permanent reality, or "substance", beneath the shifting series of phenomena, whether of matter or of mind. The substance of the cosmos was "Brahma", that of the individual man "Atman"; and the latter was separated from the former only, if I may so speak, by its phenomenal envelope, by the casing of sensations, thoughts and desires, pleasures and pains, which make up the illusive phantasmagoria of life. This the ignorant, take for reality; their "Atman" therefore remains eternally imprisoned in delusions, bound by the fetters of desire and scourged by the whip of misery.||author=Thomas Huxley{{sfn|Singh|2000|pp=96<U+2013>97}}}}

According to another writer, [[David Kalupahana]], the Upanishadic thinkers came to consider change as a mere illusion, because it could not be reconciled with a permanent and homogeneous reality. They were therefore led to a complete denial of plurality.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=14}}  He states that philosophy suffered a setback because of the transcendentalism resulting from the search of the essential unity of things.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=15}} Kalupahana explains further that reality was simply considered to be beyond space, time, change, and causality. This caused change to be a mere matter of words, nothing but a name and due to this, metaphysical speculation took the upper hand. As a result, the Upanishads fail to give any rational explanation of the experience of things.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=15}} [[Paul Deussen]] criticized the idea of unity in the Upanishads as it excluded all plurality, and therefore, all proximity in space, all succession in time, all interdependence as cause and effect, and all opposition as subject and object.{{sfn|Deussen|1908|pp=156}}

==Association with Vedas==

All {{IAST|Upanishads}} are associated with one of the four Vedas<U+2014>[[Rigveda]], [[Samaveda]], [[White Yajurveda|Shukla Yajurveda]], [[Black Yajurveda|Krishna Yajurveda]], and [[Atharvaveda]]. The {{IAST|Muktika}} Upanishad's list of 108 {{IAST|Upanishads}} groups the first 10 as ''[[mukhya]]'', 21 as [[S<U+0101>m<U+0101>nya Ved<U+0101>nta]], 23 as [[Sanny<U+0101>sa]], nine as [[Sh<U+0101>kta]], 13 as [[Vaishnava]], 14 as [[Shaiva]] and 17 as [[Yoga]].{{sfn|Sri Aurbindo Kapali Sastr Institute of Vedic Culture}} The 108 {{IAST|Upanishads}} as recorded in the {{IAST|Muktika}} are shown in the table below.{{sfn|Farquhar|1920|p=364}}{{sfn|Parmeshwaranand|2000|pp=404<U+2013>406}} The mukhya Upanishads are highlighted.
