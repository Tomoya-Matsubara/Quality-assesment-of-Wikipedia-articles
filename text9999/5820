'''''This England''''' is the classical music album by the [[Oregon Symphony]] under the [[Artistic director|artistic direction]] of [[Carlos Kalmar]], released by Dutch record label [[PentaTone Classics]] in November 2012. The album was recorded at the [[Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] at five performances in February and May 2012. It contains works by three [[Classical music of the United Kingdom|English]] [[20th-century music|20th-century]] composers: [[Edward Elgar]]'s ''[[Cockaigne (In London Town)]]'', [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' [[Symphony No. 5 (Vaughan Williams)|Symphony No. 5]], and "Four Sea Interludes" and "Passacaglia" from [[Benjamin Britten]]'s opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]''. The recording marked the orchestra's second under Kalmar's leadership, following the highly successful ''[[Music for a Time of War]]'' (2011), which also included works by Britten and Vaughan Williams and received [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance|Best Orchestral Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Classical|Best Engineered Album, Classical]]. ''This England'' received positive critical reception but failed to chart.

Elgar conducted the world premiere of ''Cockaigne (In London Town)'' at a [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] concert at [[Queen's Hall]] in London in June 1901.<ref name=Kahane/> The work has been described as an "unashamedly populist portrait of 'old London town'" and a musical description of the city at the turn of the century, with references to whistling boys, strolling lovers and marching bands.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nlDOICBmhbkC&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music|page=411|first1=Chris|last1=Woodstra|first2=Gerald|last2=Brennan|first3=Allen|last3=Schrott|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2005|issn=0-87930-865-6|location=San Francisco|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2009/whatson/notes/p12_elgar.shtml|title=Overture 'Cockaigne (In London Town)', Op. 40 (1900<U+2013>01)|accessdate=February 6, 2013|year=2009|first=John|last=Pickard|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> The Oregon Symphony last performed the overture in January 1990, under [[Norman Leyden]].

Symphony No. 5 was composed during 1936<U+2013>1943 and premiered in June 1943 with Vaughan Williams conducting the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] at [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.<ref name=Kahane/> The widely performed work evokes serenity and pastoral settings, despite being completed during [[World War II]], as its origins began as an opera in the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2000/feb/11/classicalmusicandopera|title=Vaughan Williams: Symphony No 5|accessdate=February 7, 2013|date=February 11, 2000|first=Andrew|last=Clements|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London, United Kingdom|issn=0261-3077|oclc=60623878}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jdhxk|title=Vaughan Williams: Symphony No 5|accessdate=February 7, 2013|year=2009|publisher=[[BBC Radio 3]]}}</ref> The symphony, which is approximately 41 minutes in length, contains four movements ("Preludio", "Scherzo", "Romanza" and "Passacaglia") and includes bassoon, clarinet, English horn, flute, horn, oboe, piccolo, timpani, trombone, trumpet and strings.

The recording continues with Britten's "Four Sea Interludes" and "Passacaglia". The four interludes ("Dawn", "Sunday morning", "Moonlight" and "Storm") have been published separately as Opus 33a; "Passacaglia" has also been published separately as Opus 33b. ''Peter Grimes'' premiered on June 7, 1945 at the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in London, conducted by [[Reginald Goodall]]. On June 13, Britten conducted the four interludes with the London Philharmonic in [[Cheltenham]]; [[Adrian Boult]] conducted "Passacaglia" with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] on August 29.<ref name=Arnaldo/> Prior to 2012, the Oregon Symphony's most recent performance of "Four Sea Interludes" was in 1993 under [[James DePreist]], and the orchestra had never presented "Passacaglia". The interludes and "Passacaglia" are approximately 16 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively, and include bass drum, bassoon, bells, celeste, clarinet, cymbals, contrabassoon, flute, gong, harp, horn, oboe, piccolo, snare drum, tam tam, tambourine, tenor drum, timpani, trombone, trumpet, tuba, xylophone and strings.<ref name=Arnaldo/>

''This England'' received positive critical reception. David Patrick Stearns of ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' awarded the album 3.5 out of 4 stars and, also referring to the success of ''Music for a Time of War'', wrote that the repertoire has "perfectly wide appeal, especially in vital, muscular performances such as these".<ref name=Stearns>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-01-07/news/36175652_1_broadcast-trish-keenan-berberian-sound-studio/4|title=New Recordings|work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|accessdate=February 1, 2013|page=4|first=David Patrick|last=Stearns}}</ref> Stearns, who appreciated Kalmar's balance of technicality and the music's "exterior atmosphere", called the performances "thoughtful" and "incisive". He also noted the originality of the interludes and "Passacaglia" from ''Peter Grimes'', claiming they "won't be mistaken for anybody else's."<ref name=Stearns/> In his review for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Brian Horay wrote that the orchestra delivered "knockout" and "beefy-yet-restrained" performances of the ''Peter Grimes'' compositions.<ref name=Horay>{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-horay/the-oregon-symphony-goes-_b_2115784.html|title=The Oregon Symphony Goes to England|accessdate=February 27, 2013|date=November 12, 2012|first=Brian|last=Horay|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref> Referring to ''This England'' and its preceding album, which featured ''[[Sinfonia da Requiem]]'', Horay said the recordings "showcase Kalmar and his band as supreme interpreters of Benjamin Britten's amazingly colorful brand of orchestral anxiety, inviting the listener to delve ever deeper into painful, yet rewarding, symphonic ambivalence."<ref name=Horay/> Classical CD Review's Robert Benson called the Elgar performance "brilliant" and appreciated that "Passacaglia" was programmed before "The Storm".<ref name=Benson>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicalcdreview.com/MC405.html|title=Reviews|first=Robert|last=Benson|date=December 2012|publisher=Classical CD Review|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref> Benson complimented Kalmar (calling him a "conductor to watch") as well as the sound of the recording, describing it as "well-balanced orchestral sound, with a wide dynamic range".<ref name=Benson/> He noted the lack of audience interference with the sound and assured audiophiles would appreciate the quality.<ref name=Benson/> Steven Ritter of Audiophile Audition wrote that the Symphony performed "with a brilliance and verve equal to any on record" and were "entirely attuned to the 'English' idiom".<ref name=Ritter>{{Cite web|url=http://audaud.com/2013/02/this-england-elgar-cockaigne-vaughan-williams-symphony-no-5-britten-four-sea-interludes-and-passacaglia-from-peter-grimes-oregon-sym-carlos-kalmar-penta/|title="This England" = Elgar: Cockaigne (in London Town), Op. 40; Vaughan Williams: Symphony No. 5 in D; Britten: Four Sea Interludes and Passacaglia from Peter Grimes, Op. 33a and b <U+2013> Oregon Symphony/ Carlos Kalmar <U+2013> PentaTone multichannel SACD 5186 471, 77:29 (11/13/12)|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=February 21, 2013|first=Steven|last=Ritter|publisher=Audiophile Audition}}</ref> Ritter complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for the performances and opined: "Who knew Oregon could sound like this?
