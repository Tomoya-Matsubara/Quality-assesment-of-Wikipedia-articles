'''''Fever''''' is the eighth studio album by Australian singer [[Kylie Minogue]], released on 1 October 2001 in Australia and the United Kingdom by [[Parlophone]]. The album was later released in the United States on 26 February 2002 and was Minogue's first album release in the region since her second studio album ''[[Enjoy Yourself (Kylie Minogue album)|Enjoy Yourself]]'' (1989). Minogue worked with writers and producers such as [[Cathy Dennis]], [[Rob Davis (musician)|Rob Davis]], [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]], [[Julian Gallagher]], [[TommyD]], [[Tom Nichols]], [[Pascal Gabriel]] and others to create the [[disco]] and [[Europop]]-influenced [[dance-pop]] album. Other musical influences of the album range from [[synthpop]] to [[club music|club]] music.

Four singles were released from the album. Its lead single "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" was released in September 2001 and became a massive commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 40 countries and selling more than five million copies worldwide.

Follow-up singles "[[In Your Eyes (Kylie Minogue song)|In Your Eyes]]" and "[[Love at First Sight (Kylie Minogue song)|Love at First Sight]]" also performed well on charts internationally.

All four singles charted within the top 10 in Australia and the United Kingdom, with "Can't Get You Out of My Head" peaking at number one in both countries. In order to promote the album, Minogue embarked on the [[KylieFever2002]] tour.

''Fever'' is primarily a [[dance-pop]] album, with prominent elements of [[1970s in music|1970s]]-influenced [[disco]] and [[Europop]].<ref name=albumreviewallmusic /><ref name=albumreviewnme /><ref name=albumreviewpopmatters /> Jacqueline Hodges from [[BBC Music]] wrote that the album is not "pure [[Pop music|pop]]", and is rather characterized by a more adventurous dance-oriented sound.<ref name=albumreviewbbc /> ''[[NME]]'' critic Alex Needham identified a "filter disco effect", described as "the one that sounds like you've gone under water and then ecstatically come up for air," working on various songs on the album.<ref name=albumreviewnme /> Needham saw ''Fever'' as an "update" from the "frothy disco" of ''Light Years''.<ref name=albumreviewnme /> Songs like the opening track "More More More" and closing track "Burning Up" are examples of the disco-influenced production of the album. The former is an [[uptempo]] song with a "funky" [[bassline]],<ref name=albumreviewbbc>{{cite web|last=Hodges|first=Jacqueline|title=Kylie Minogue Fever Review|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/nvrg|publisher=[[BBC Music]].

The latter track contains instrumentation from an [[acoustic guitar]].<ref name=albumreviewbbc /> Jason Thompson from [[PopMatters]] commented that Minogue "knows how to express herself through irresistible melodies and seductive emoting",<ref name=albumreviewpopmatters /> such as on the title track, which makes use of "suggestive panting".<ref name=albumreviewbbc /> Unlike Minogue's previous studio efforts, ''Fever'' does not contain any [[ballads]].<ref name=albumreviewallmusic />

The lyrical content of ''Fever'' chiefly focuses on themes of love and enjoyment. Thompson described the album to be "all about dancing, fucking, and having a good time".<ref name=albumreviewpopmatters /> In the song "Love at First Sight", Minogue describes how she fell in love with her partner at "[[Love at first sight|first sight]]" and how it led to good things happening for her.<ref name=albumreviewpopmatters /> "Can't Get You Out of My Head" was termed a "mystery" as the singer never mentions who the her object of desire in the song is.<ref name=cantgetyououtofmyheadtheguardian /> Lynskey Dorian from ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that Minogue refers to either "a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists" as her obsession.<ref name=cantgetyououtofmyheadtheguardian /> The production of "Give It to Me" contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to "slow down," but the beat "goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push it a little more on the dance floor."<ref name=albumreviewpopmatters /> The lyrics of "Fragile" are simple and aim directly at the "[listener's] heart".<ref name=albumreviewpopmatters /> "Come into My World" is a "plea for love" as Minogue invites her partner into her life.<ref name=albumreviewpopmatters /> On the other hand, "Dancefloor" focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by "lose[ing] it in the music".<ref name=albumreviewpopmatters />
