'''''Tri Sviatitelia''''' ('''{{lang-ru|<U+0422><U+0440><U+0438> <U+0421><U+0432><U+044F><U+0442><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044F>}}''' meaning the [[Three Holy Hierarchs]]) was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] during the 1890s. She served with the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and was [[flagship]] of the forces pursuing the mutinous battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} in June 1905. During [[World War I]] the ship encountered the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} (formally ''Yavuz Sultan Selim'') twice, but never hit the German ship, nor was she damaged by her. From 1915 onward she was relegated to the coast bombardment role as she was the oldest battleship in the Black Sea Fleet. ''Tri Sviatitelia'' was refitting in [[Sevastopol]] when the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 began and she was never operational afterwards. 

She was captured when the Germans took the city in May 1918 and was turned over to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in November 1918. ''Tri Sviatitelia''{{'}}s engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing [[Bolsheviks]] from using her against the [[White movement|White Russians]]. She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the [[Crimea]] in 1920 and was scrapped in 1923.

==Design==
[[File:Tri Svyatitelya diagrams Brasseys 1896.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1896</center>]]

''Tri Sviatitelia''{{'}}s design was based on an enlarged version of the [[Baltic Fleet]] battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Navarin||2}} with some improvements in armour and armament.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 73</ref>

===General characteristics===
''Tri Sviatitelia'' was {{convert|371|ft|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|378|ft|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|73|ft|3|in|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|6|in|1}}. She displaced  {{convert|13415|LT|t|lk=on}}, over {{convert|800|LT|t|abbr=on}} more than her designed displacement of {{convert|12480|LT|t|abbr=on}}.<ref name=m72>McLaughlin, p. 72</ref> ''Tri Sviatitelia'' was considerably larger than ''Navarin'', being {{convert|23|ft|6|in|1}} longer, {{convert|6|ft|1}} wider and displacing {{convert|3000|LT|t|abbr=on}} more. She had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|5.58|ft|m|1}}.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 73<U+2013>74</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Tri Sviatitelia'' had two three-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]] built by the British firm of Humphreys & Tennant that had a total designed output of {{convert|10600|ihp|lk=on}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 46</ref> 14 cylindrical [[fire-tube boiler]]s provided steam to the engines at a pressure of {{convert|128|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, which drove two four-bladed screw [[propeller]]s. On [[sea trial]]s, the powerplant produced a total of {{convert|11308|ihp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|16.5|knots}}. She carried a maximum of {{convert|1000|LT|MT}} of coal at full load that provided a range of {{convert|2250|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. ''Tri Sviatitelia'' had three [[dynamo]]s with a total output of 305&nbsp;kW, but these were too small and could not supply full power to all the electrical equipment simultaneously.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 72, 75<U+2013>76</ref>

===Armament===
Her main armament consisted of two pairs of {{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}} Obukhov Model 1895 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns mounted in hydraulically powered twin [[turret]]s fore and aft. Each turret had a firing arc of 270<U+00B0>. The guns had a rate of fire of 105 seconds between rounds.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 74<U+2013>75</ref> These guns had a maximum elevation of 15 degrees and could depress to -5 degrees. They fired a {{convert|731.3|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2598|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a range of {{convert|12010|yd|m}} at an elevation of 10<U+00B0>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_12-40_m1895.htm|title=Russian 12"/40 (30.5 cm) Pattern 1895 305 mm/40 (12") Pattern 1895|date=12 January 2009|publisher=Navweaps.com |accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> 75 rounds per gun were carried.<ref name=m72/>

All eight {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} [[Canet guns|Canet Pattern]] 1892 45-caliber guns were mounted in [[casemate]]s on the upper deck. The guns could elevate to a maximum of 20 degrees and depress to -5 degrees. They fired shells that weighed {{convert|91.27|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2600|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. They had a maximum range of {{convert|12600|yd|m}} when fired at maximum elevation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_6-45_m1892.htm|title=Russian 6"/45 (15.2 cm) Pattern 1892 152 mm/45 (6") Pattern 1892|date=12 January 2009|publisher=Navweps.com |accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

The anti-[[torpedo boat]] armament consisted of a large number of different guns. Four {{convert|4.7|in|0|adj=on}} Canet Pattern 1892 45-calibre guns were mounted at the corners of the superstructure.<ref name=m75>McLaughlin, p. 75</ref> The gun fired {{convert|45.15|lb|kg|adj=on}} shells to a range of about {{convert|11000|yd}} at 18 degrees elevation with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_47-45_m1892.htm |date=16 March 2006|title=Russian 120 mm/45 (4.7") Pattern 1892|publisher=Navweaps.com|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref> A total of 10 {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were carried: six between the 4.7-inch guns, two at the forward end of the superstructure and two in [[embrasure]]s in the aft hull.<ref name=m75/> They fired a {{convert|3.3|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1476|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of {{convert|2020|yd|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_47mm_Hotchkiss.htm|title=Russia 47 mm/5 (1.85") Hotchkiss gun 47 mm/1 (1.85") Hotchkiss gun [3-pdr (1.4 kg) Hotchkiss guns] |date=1 December 2006|accessdate=22 December 2009|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref> A total of 40 {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on}} Hotchkiss guns were mounted; eight in each of the [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]]s, eight on top of the superstructure, twelve in small hull embrasures fore and aft and the locations of the remaining four are uncertain.<ref name=m75/> They fired a {{convert|1.1|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1450|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of {{convert|3038|yd|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_37mm_Hotchkiss.htm|title=Russia 37 mm/5 (1.5") Hotchkiss Gun 37 mm/1 (1.5") Hotchkiss Gun [1-pdr (0.45 kg) Hotchkiss Guns] |date=1 December 2006|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

''Tri Sviatitelia'' carried six {{convert|15|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The forward broadside tubes were underwater, but the other four tubes were above water, one each in the bow and stern and the aft pair of [[broadside]] tubes.<ref name=m75/> The Type L torpedo carried a {{convert|141|lb|adj=on}} [[warhead]] of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. It had two speed settings which gave it a maximum range of {{convert|980|yd}} at {{convert|25|kn}} or {{convert|660|yd}} at {{convert|29|kn}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTRussian_PreWWII.htm|title=Russia / USSR Torpedoes Pre-World War II|date=19 November 2008|publisher=Navweaps.com|accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref>

===Protection===
''Tri Sviatitelia'' was the first Russian ship to use [[Harvey armour]].<ref name=m75/> The armour was made by [[Vickers]] in Britain as well as the French firms of [[Schneider Electric|Schneider et Cie]] and [[Forges et Acieries de la Marine et Homecourt <U+00E0> Saint Chamond|Saint Chamond]]. The maximum thickness of the [[Belt armor|waterline belt]]  was {{convert|18|in|mm|0}} which reduced to {{convert|16|in|mm|0}} abreast the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s. This was the thickest armour ever carried by a Russian battleship.<ref name=m75/> It covered {{convert|246|ft|m|1}} of the ship's length. The belt was {{convert|8|ft|1}} high, and tapered down to a thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} at the bottom edge. The upper {{convert|18|in|1}} of the belt was intended to be above the waterline, but the ship was overweight and much of the belt was submerged. The belt terminated in {{convert|14|-|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s.<ref>Gardiner, p. 180</ref> 

The lower casemate was above the belt, {{convert|218|ft|1}} long and eight feet high, and was intended to protect the bases of the turrets. It had 16-inch sides and was closed off by 16-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The upper casemate protected the six-inch guns and was {{convert|5|in|mm|0}} thick on all sides. The sides of the turrets were {{convert|16|in|0}} thick and the conning tower's sides were {{convert|12|in|mm|0}} in thickness. The nickel steel armor deck was {{convert|2|in}} thick over the lower casemate, but {{convert|3|in}} thick forward and aft of the main armor belt to the bow and stern.<ref name=m75/>

===Major refit in 1911-12===
''Tri Sviatitelia'' was reconstructed between November 1911 and August 1912. A number of different proposals had been considered earlier, including one to replace all of her obsolete Harvey armour with modern [[Krupp armour]] and others to replace her main guns or turrets, but these were rejected as too expensive. Her masts and fighting tops were replaced by pole masts and all of her light guns and torpedo tubes were removed with the exception of two 47-millimetre guns retained for use as saluting guns. Her 4.7-inch guns were replaced by four shielded 6-inch guns on the roof of the upper casemate. The upper casemate was modified to accommodate two extra 6-inch guns and her superstructure was reduced in size. The maximum elevation of her main guns was increased to 25<U+00B0> and their [[Breech-loading weapon|breeches]] and loading mechanisms were upgraded to increase their rate of fire to one round every 40 seconds. These modifications had the effect of reducing her displacement by almost {{convert|100|LT|t|0}} and she was capable of {{convert|16|kn}} on her post-reconstruction sea trials.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 289</ref>

==Service==
''Tri Sviatitelia'' was named after the [[Three Holy Hierarchs]] of the [[Orthodox Church]]. She was built by [[Nikolayev Dockyard]] and laid down 15 August 1891, although actual construction had begun about January 1891. The ship was launched 12 November 1893 and transferred to [[Sevastopol]] for completion the following year. Officially she entered service in 1895 with the Black Sea Fleet, but her sea trials did not begin until September<U+2013>October 1896.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 72, 76</ref> In 1899 ''Tri Svititelia'' became the first ship in the world to be fitted with a radio, an installation designed by the Russian physicist [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]] that had a range of about {{convert|3|mi|1}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 158</ref> She was flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[F. F. Vishnevetskii]] during the pursuit of the mutinous battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} in June 1905.<ref name=m76>McLaughlin, p. 76</ref> ''Tri Svititelia''{{'}}s forward fighting top was removed about 1908.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 292</ref>

===World War I===
''Tri Sviatitelia'', accompanied by the pre-dreadnoughts {{ship|Russian battleship|Evstafi||2}} (flagship),  {{ship|Russian battleship|Ioann Zlatoust||2}}, {{ship|Russian battleship|Pantelimon||2}}, {{ship|Russian battleship|Rostislav||2}}, and bombarded [[Trebizond]] on the morning of 17 November 1914 and was intercepted by the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}} the following day on their return voyage to Sevastopol in what came to be known as the [[Battle of Cape Sarych]]. Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy and the capital ships initially did not spot each other. The Black Sea Fleet had experimented on concentrating fire from several ships under the control of a "master ship" before the war and ''Evstafi'' held her fire until ''Ioann Zlatoust'', the master ship, could see ''Goeben''. When the gunnery commands were finally received they showed a range {{convert|4000|yd}} in excess of ''Evstafi''{{'}}s own estimate of {{convert|8000|yd}}, so ''Evstafi'' opened fire using her own data before the ''Goeben'' turned to unmask its broadside. However the ''Tri Sviatitelia'' used ''Ioann Zlatoust''{{'}}s inaccurate range data and failed to register any hits on the German ship.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 303<U+2013>04</ref>

''Tri Sviatitelia'' and ''Rostislav'' bombarded [[Ottoman]] fortifications at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] on 18 March 1915, but only fired 105 rounds before sailing north to rejoin the covering force.<ref name=N49,53/> ''Tri Sviatitelia'' and ''Rostislav'' were to have repeated the bombardment the following day, but heavy fog prevented the operation.<ref>Halpern, p. 230</ref> On 3 April, ''Goeben'' and several ships of the Turkish navy raided the Russian port at [[Odessa]]; the Russian battleship squadron sortied to intercept them. The battleships chased ''Goeben'' the entire day, but were unable to reach effective gunnery range and were forced to break off the chase.<ref>Halpern, p. 231</ref> On 25 April ''Tri Sviatitelia'' and ''Rostislav'' repeated their bombardment of the Bosporus forts. ''Sviatitelia'', ''Rostislav'' and ''Pantelimon'' bombarded the forts again on 2 and 3 May. However, this time a total of 337 main gun rounds were fired in addition to a total of 528 six-inch shells between the three battleships.<ref name=N49,53>Nekrasov, pp. 49, 54</ref> 

On 9 May 1915 ''Tri Sviatitelia'' and ''Pantelimon'', returned to bombard the Bosphorus forts, covered by the remaining pre-dreadnoughts. ''Goeben'' intercepted the three ships of the covering force, although no damage was inflicted by either side. ''Tri Sviatitelia'' and ''Pantelimon'' rejoined their consorts and the latter scored two hits on ''Goeben'' before she broke off the action. The Russian ships pursued her for six hours before giving up the chase.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 304</ref> ''Tri Sviatitelia'' was fitted with a pair of {{convert|63.5|mm|adj=on}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]]
on top of each of her turrets during 1915 and screens were added on top of her funnels to keep out light bombs.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 310</ref> On 12 August 1915 she, and all the other pre-dreadnoughts, were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Brigade, after the dreadnought {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperatritsa Mariya||2}} had entered service. During 1916 she conducted coast bombardment and anti-shipping missions off the [[Anatolia]]n coast.<ref name=m76/>

''Tri Sviatitelia'' was refitting in Sevastopol during the February Revolution of 1917. Immobile, she was captured by the Germans in Sevastopol in May 1918 and handed over to the Allies in December 1918 after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]]. The British wrecked her engines on 24 April 1919 when they left the [[Crimea]] to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using her against the White Russians. The ship was captured by both sides during the [[Russian Civil War]], but was abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. ''Tri Sviatitelia'' was scrapped in 1923, although she was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.<ref name=m76/>
