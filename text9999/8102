'''Macau International Airport''' ({{zh-t|t=<U+6FB3><U+9580><U+570B><U+969B><U+6A5F><U+5834>}}, {{lang-pt|Aeroporto Internacional de Macau}}) is the only airport in the former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Portuguese Empire|colony]] of [[Macau]], now a [[Special Administrative Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].

The airport is a common transfer point for people traveling between [[mainland China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], and is also one of the few world airports with direct flights to [[North Korea]].

As in [[Hong Kong]], Macau has its own immigration policies and is a separate customs territory from mainland China. Travellers between Macau and Mainland China need to go through immigration and customs checks. Flights between Macau and mainland China are therefore treated as international flights.

== History ==

The airport was opened in November 1995, during the Portuguese rule. Before then the city only had 2 temporary airports for small aeroplanes, in addition to several permanent heliports. [[Cathay Pacific]] operated seaplane service between [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] in the late 1940s. The only air services Macau had in the 1990s was helicopter services operated by [[East Asia Airlines]] to Hong Kong.

Facilities in Macau:

* Seaplane hangar on [[Taipa Island]]
* Macau Naval Aviation Centre in the Outer Harbour - southeast side of the mainland
* Temporary airstrip on [[Coloane]]
* Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Pier, Macau heliport

== Facilities ==

The airport's runway was built on a strip of reclaimed land in the sea, adjacent to [[Taipa Island]], where the main terminal and air traffic control facilities are located. The runway is connected to the apron by two causeways. Runway 34 is [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] CAT II equipped.

The airport's designed capacity is 6,000,000 passengers per year, with processing capacity of up to 2,000 passengers per hour. The airport does not have a night curfew. There are 24 parking spaces for aircraft in the apron, with 4 [[jetway]]s.

Despite its small physical size, the airport is capable of handling [[Boeing 747]]s, which forms a vital freight link between local manufacturers and overseas markets. Its catering facility can produce up to 10,000 meals per day.
