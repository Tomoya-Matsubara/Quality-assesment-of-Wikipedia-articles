"'''Volcano'''" is the third episode of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on August 27, 1997. In the episode, the four main characters, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], go on a hunting trip with Stan's uncle [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]] and his war buddy [[List of South Park residents#Ned Gerblansky|Ned]].  While on the trip, Stan is frustrated by his inability to shoot a living creature and Cartman tries to scare the hunting party with tales of a creature named [[List of minor characters on South Park#Scuzzlebutt|Scuzzlebutt]]. Meanwhile, the group is unaware that a nearby volcano is about to erupt.

Written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], the episode was rated [[Television content rating systems#United States|TV-M]] in the United States. The episode was inspired by the 1997 disaster films ''[[Volcano (film)|Volcano]]'' and ''[[Dante's Peak]]'', both of which Parker and Stone strongly disliked. The plot was also based on the large amount of hunting Parker and Stone witnessed while growing up in Colorado; Stan's hesitation about the sport mirrors Parker's real-life feelings about hunting. Parker and Stone felt the animation in "Volcano" had greatly improved compared to the early episodes; they were particularly pleased with the lava, which was made on a computer to resemble orange [[construction paper]].

"Volcano" received generally positive reviews and was nominated for a 1997 [[Environmental Media Awards|Environmental Media Award]]. Slightly more than 1 million viewers watched the original broadcast, according to [[Nielsen Ratings]]. The episode featured the first appearances of recurring characters Ned Gerblansky and [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]]. The latter, who is also the town geologist, is established as Stan's father in later episodes. It also marked the first of two appearances for Scuzzlebutt, who became a popular minor character and appeared in the mobile video game, ''[[South Park 10: The Game]]''. The episode parodied the [[Duck and Cover]] educational videos from the 1950s and 1960s that advised people to hide under tables in the event of a nuclear attack.

==Plot==
At the start of the episode, Stan's [[Jimbo Kern|Uncle Jimbo]] and his [[Vietnam War]] buddy [[List of other South Park residents#Ned Gerblansky|Ned]] take Stan, Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman on a hunting trip in the mountains. As they arrive, Jimbo explains to the boys how to hunt. Whenever they see a creature, they shoot it after yelling, "It's coming right for us!", so they can claim the shooting was in self-defense. Stan doesn't have the proper temperament to enjoy hunting, and finds himself unable to shoot a living target. Unlike Stan, Kenny is able to shoot animals, impressing Jimbo. Meanwhile, South Park geologist [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] discovers that the mountain on which the boys are hunting is a volcano that is about to erupt. He reports his findings to the [[List of other South Park residents#Mayor McDaniels|Mayor]], who directs one of her aides to make appropriate decisions about the crisis.

During the hunting trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, upsetting Stan. When night falls, Cartman tells the story of Scuzzlebutt, a mutant creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and [[Patrick Duffy]] for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. The boys then see Cartman in disguised as Scuzzlebutt and the boys start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman at the base of the mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman enough time to escape and remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to dig a trench to divert the lava away from the town. 

Suddenly the volcano erupts. The hunters try to flee, but find themselves trapped on the other side of the trench. The real Scuzzlebutt then appears, and weaves a wicker basket to carry the hunting party to safety. Jimbo apologizes to the boys for their seemingly imminent deaths. The lava then flows through the trench and destroys [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] due to the geologist's miscalculation. However, in a misguided attempt to prove he can kill something and impress his uncle, Stan kills Scuzzlebutt. Unfortunately for Stan, Jimbo is less than impressed, telling Stan that he will always be his nephew but that "some things you do kill and some you don't." Stan doesn't understand, since Jimbo tried to kill Scuzzlebutt earlier in the episode. Ned states that he understands the folly of guns and drops his rifle, which fires, killing Kenny. Finally, the boys decide that hunting is stupid and go home to watch cartoons.

[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=Two men sit in chairs. The man on the right holds a microphone and gestures with his left hand.|''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] wrote and directed "Volcano".]]"Volcano" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. The episode was inspired by volcano-related [[Hollywood]] [[disaster films]], such as ''[[Dante's Peak]]'' (1997) and ''[[Volcano (film)|Volcano]]'' (1997), which came out around the time they were writing the script; Parker and Stone considered the films two of the worst ever made. Stone said, "If you watch this episode and then go watch ''Volcano'', this makes more sense than ''Volcano'' does."<ref name="commentary">{{cite video|year=2002|people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|title=[[South Park (season 1)|South Park - The Complete First Season]]: Audio Commentary for Volcano|medium=CD|publisher=Sunset Strategic Marketing; Comedy Central}}</ref> [[Debbie Liebling]], who served as a ''South Park'' producer at the time of the episode's broadcast, said the volcano erupting in South Park helped establish the setting as a place where "anything can happen".<ref>{{cite news|title=That's not all, folks|work=[[The Australian]]|author=Danielsen, Shane|page=14|date=1997-12-29}}</ref> Although Stone and Parker acknowledged that a volcano could not actually erupt in this Colorado town, they felt they were entitled to create the episode anyway because the ''Volcano'' film was set in [[Los Angeles]]; Stone said, "If they could do it, we could." Similarly, the duo acknowledge the tunnel built in the episode would not really divert the lava, but they included it because Parker said, "Any movie today, that's basically how dumb they are."<ref name="commentary" />

Another influence on the plot was the large amount of hunting Parker and Stone saw around them while growing up in Colorado. Neither of the two were hunters, and Parker said Stan's hesitation about hunting was based largely on himself and his father, who hated the idea of killing an animal even though Parker's grandfather, like Jimbo, was very enthusiastic about the sport. Parker said he feels many of the first season episodes considered taboo in 1997 would have been considered less controversial five years later, but that "Volcano" is an exception. Since the episode involved children drinking beer and threatening each other at gunpoint during hunting trips, Parker said he did not believe Comedy Central would have allowed it to air following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999. Parker said, "Back then, it was just sort of funny, kids pointing guns at each other, and it's just not so funny now."<ref name="commentary" />

''South Park'' animators spent the first four episodes of the show trying to perfect the animation of the characters.<ref name="DougPratt">{{cite book|title=Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!|page=1123|author=Pratt, Douglas|date=2005|publisher=UNET 2 Corporation|isbn=1932916016}}</ref> By "Volcano", Parker and Stone felt the textures were improved, as well as smaller details like the lines around the eyes of the characters. While the series pilot "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]" was animated with construction paper, "Volcano" was made using a computer. Nevertheless, Parker and Stone wanted the show to maintain its crude paper look; for example, they specifically asked for the night sky to look like a black piece of paper with holes cut into it for stars, just as it was in the pilot episode. Stone and Parker were especially proud of the animation of the lava, which they said took hours to perfect, although they acknowledged it ended up simply resembling orange construction paper. The lava ball coming out of the volcano was directly inspired by the ''Volcano'' film.<ref name="commentary" /> Parker and Stone came up with the character of Scuzzlebutt during a random conversation with Comedy Central executive Debbie Liebling. While meeting with her, they simply started drawing the character, and decided to add a celery hand and Patrick Duffy leg for no particular reason.<ref name="commentary" /> Scuzzlebutt appeared in only one other episode, "[[City on the Edge of Forever]]" from the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=City on the Edge of Forever|episodelink=City_on_the_Edge_of_Forever |series=South Park |serieslink=South Park|credits=Stone, Matt; Parker, Trey; Pimental, Nancy M.|network=[[Comedy Central]] |airdate=1998-06-17 |season=2 |number=7}}</ref> Scuzzlebutt turning out to be a real character rather than a ridiculous story was the first instance of a common characteristic of the Cartman character, in which Cartman says outrageous and completely unrealistic things that turn out to be true. Stone commented, "He's right more often than he's wrong."<ref name="commentary" />

The "Volcano" episode was in production when ''South Park'' debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did not object to most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized "Volcano" was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song "[[Kumbaya]]" around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.<ref name="commentary" />

In addition to Scuzzlebutt, "Volcano" included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified only as the South Park geologist,<ref name="commentary" /> and it is only in the episode "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]" that he is first introduced as Stan's father.<ref name="commentary" /><ref>{{cite episode |title=An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig|episodelink=An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig|series=South Park |serieslink=South Park|credits=Stone, Matt; Parker, Trey; Sterling, Dan|network=[[Comedy Central]] |airdate=1997-09-10 |season=1 |number=5}}</ref> Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the [[United States Geological Survey]]. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano&mdash;calmly sipping his coffee&mdash;is "about how my dad would react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurant in [[Boulder, Colorado]], where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.<ref name="commentary" />

"Volcano" was released alongside five other episodes in a three-VHS set on May 5, 1998, marking the first time ''South Park'' was made available on video. The episode was released on the "Volume I" video along with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"; other featured episodes included "[[An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig]]", "[[Death (South Park)|Death]]", "[[Weight Gain 4000]]", and "[[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]]".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Comedy Central's South Park &ndash; Three Collectible Videos Available For The First Time With Made-For-Video Footage Featuring Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone|work=[[Business Wire]]|date=1998-03-26|location=[[Burbank, California]]}}</ref> "South Park: The Complete First Season", a DVD box set featuring all thirteen episodes, including "Volcano", was released on November 12, 2002.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lawson |first=Terry |title=4-disc "Rings" could take up a whole weekend |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=2002-11-12 |location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]}}</ref> Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but the tracks were not included on the DVDs due to "standards" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released on a separate CD.<ref name="DougPratt" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Owen |first=Rob | authorlink = Rob Owen (journalist) |title="South Park" warped and worthy |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=2002-11-22 |location=[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] |page=39}}</ref>

==Cultural references and additional notes==
[[File:Ia Drang Infantry proceed.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black-and-white photo showing two armed men walking through high grass pointing their guns in front of them.|The [[Vietnam War]] is mentioned in the episode.]]The episode features a fictional education film called ''Lava and You'', which says lava will pass harmlessly over a potential victim who ducks and covers their heads. The film was inspired by actual "[[Duck and Cover]]" videos from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls in the case of a [[nuclear weapon]] attack;<ref name="commentary" /><ref name="Auckland" /> Parker and Stone, like many critics of the videos, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the [[Vietnam War]], a military conflict between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far too young to have participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in that war. [[Patrick Duffy]], the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]'' and ''[[Step By Step (TV series)|Step By Step]]'', appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone claimed there was no particular reason Duffy was chosen as the leg except that he is such a nondescript actor: "He's just super bland. Like, how could you possibly be a fan of Patrick Duffy?"<ref name="commentary" />

The scene where Scuzzlebutt puts a star on top of a tree is a reference to a similar scene in the 1964 television special, ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', in which the [[Yeti|Abominable Snow Monster]] places a Christmas star atop a large tree. Mount Evanston, the fictional mountain in "Volcano", was named after the real [[Mount Evans]] in the [[Front Range]] region of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[Clear Creek County, Colorado]]; Nichols Canyon in the episode was named after Kirt Nichols, a friend of Trey Parker.<ref name="commentary" /> Jimbo blames the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for passing overly restrictive laws that on hunters and gun owners.<ref name="Auckland">{{Cite news |last=Hawes |first=Peter |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |location=[[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] |date=1999-07-18 |title=In which I finally discovered the Park |page=F7}}</ref> Upon learning children are in danger due to the volcano, Mayor McDaniels seeks publicity for herself by contacting the television news programs ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Grennan |first=Karin |work=Ventura County Star |date=1998-02-13 |title=Going down to "South Park": The most talked about 30 minutes on television are also the most offensive.
