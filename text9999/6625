==Cricketing career==
Smith played three home [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for [[England cricket team|England]] versus [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] in 2003. He made 64 on debut, but scored only 23 runs in his next four [[innings#Cricket|innings]], and was dropped for the subsequent tour of [[Indian subcontinent|the subcontinent]].

Smith was a tall right-handed batsman with a penchant for the drive and represented [[England national cricket team|England]], [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]].

During thirteen seasons of first-class cricket, he scored 34 centuries. He hit a peak in 2003, scoring 135, 0, 122, 149, 113, 203, 36, 108 and 32 for Kent in July of that year. He averaged 72.99 for the 2003 first-class season when he was selected for England.

He left his native county following the 2004 season and joined Middlesex for 2005. He captained the county for two seasons during 2007 and 2008. After missing most of the 2008 season due to an ankle injury, Smith announced his retirement later that year.<ref>{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/current/story/379550.html |title=Ed Smith announces his retirement |author=Cricinfo staff |date=25 November 2008 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}} Retrieved on 25 November 2008.</ref>
