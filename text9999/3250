== Production history ==
Farrell used [[Fort Strong]], an abandoned post Civil War-era fort on [[Long Island, Boston|Long Island]] (an island in [[Boston Harbor]]), as the location for this production. The fort lacked electricity and Farrell's production used torchlight to illuminate the scenes that were set inside the structure<ref>[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=2000 Film Threat review]</ref>

Production took place between March and September 1987. However, the film went over its original $50,000 budget and Farrell was unable to secure financing to complete the production. As Farrell recalled in the book ''The Encyclopedia of Underground Movies'': "The original intent with ''Richard the Second'' was to shoot in broadcast 1" format and transfer to 35mm. We shot with an Ikekami camera and used Sony reel-to-reel. I even did a test trailer in the edit suite which sent to a place in [[Los Angeles]] called Image Transform, which sent us back the trailer on 35 - this was when laser transfer was the new thing for video to film (no scan lines!)."<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Underground Movies'', Michael Wiese Productions.

The film was given a direct-to-video release in 2001.
