'''USS ''Humboldt'' (AVP-21/AG-121)''' was a [[Barnegat-class seaplane tender|''Barnegat''-class]] [[seaplane tender]] acquired by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She served in the North and South [[Atlantic Ocean]]s and, at war<U+2019>s end, she was loaned to the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] where she was known as '''USCGC ''Humboldt'' (WAVP-372)''' and later as '''USCGC ''Humboldt'' (WHEC-372)'''. 

==Built at the Boston Navy Yard==
''Humboldt'' (AVP-21) was launched by [[Boston Navy Yard]] [[17 March]] [[1941]]; sponsored by Mrs. William T. Tarrant; and commissioned [[7 October]] [[1941]], Comdr. W. G. Tomkinson in command.
 
== World War II service==
===Atlantic Ocean operations===
Following rigorous [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] training off the Atlantic coast, the new seaplane tender sailed from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[13 May]] [[1942]] to join Rear Admiral [[Jonas H. Ingrain]]'s South Atlantic Force on the [[Brazil]]ian coast. After stops at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], and [[Trinidad]] she arrived [[Recife, Brazil]], [[5 August]] and began tending the aircraft of VP-83. 

During the months that followed, these patrol aircraft, operating with ships of the Brazilian and U.S. Navies, patrolled the vital South [[Atlantic Ocean]] sea lanes and hunted down [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[submarine]]s. ''Humboldt'' supplied and repaired seaplanes and, in addition, carried [[aviation gasoline]] to outlying air bases on the coast while engaging in [[antisubmarine]] patrol herself.
 
===President Roosevelt arrives on board===
While at [[Natal, Brazil]], [[28 January]] [[1943]], ''Humboldt'' was the site of a conference between President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], returning from the [[Casablanca Conference]], and President [[Get<U+00FA>lio Vargas]] of [[Brazil]]. Following this meeting, which helped to achieve even closer cooperation between the naval units of the two countries, the seaplane tender continued to visit isolated ports on the Brazilian coast with supplies, establishing a new seaplane base at [[Arat<U+00FA>]], [[Bahia]], in May [[1943]].
 
''Humboldt'' headed north [[1 July]] [[1943]], arriving [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[17 July]] to take up new duties in the North Atlantic. Sailing [[23 August]], the ship carried supplies and parts to the Fleet Air Wings in [[Newfoundland]], [[Iceland]], and [[Great Britain]]. She continued this dangerous duty, often sailing unescorted, into the early months of 1944, occasionally sailing to [[Casablanca]] as well. 

===Mediterranean operations===
She was at Casablanca in late May [[1944]] and upon hearing of the torpedoing of escort carrier [[USS Block Island (CVE-21)|''Block Island'']] and destroyer [[USS Barr (DE-576)|Barr]] steamed out to help with survivors and to escort ''Barr'' to safety. ''Humboldt'' was soon underway again, this time to bring an experienced submarine officer to rendezvous with [[USS Guadalcanal (CVE-60)|''Guadalcanal'']]'s [[hunter-killer group]], which had just captured [[Unterseeboot 505|''U-505'']] in an epic encounter [[4 June]]. The seaplane tender continued to bring supplies to squadrons in the [[Azores]] and [[North Africa]] until [[22 March]] [[1945]] when she sailed from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], for Brazil.
 
Returning to her original tending duties in the South Atlantic, ''Humboldt'' arrived [[Recife, Brazil]], [[5 April]] and remained on duty until the surrender of [[Germany]], after which she sailed for Norfolk [[10 June]]. 

She moved to [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] [[16 July]] for conversion to a Press Ship. Re-classified ''AG-121'' [[30 July]] [[1945]], ''Humboldt'' was to serve as a broadcast and [[teletype]] center for correspondents during the final phases of the war against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]; but the war ended before her conversion was completed. 

==Post-war decommissioning==
Arriving [[Orange, Texas]], [[22 November]] [[1945]], the ship decommissioned [[19 March]] [[1947]] and entered the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. 

==Conversion to Coast Guard use ==
Loaned to the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] in January [[1949]], she served at [[Boston, Massachusetts]], as a weather ship, designated ''WHEC-372''.  She was later redesignated ''High Endurance Cutter (WHEC-372)'', [[1 May]] [[1966]], and, on [[30 September]] [[1969]], she was decommissioned and returned to the Navy, where she was struck from the [[Navy list]] in 1970.
