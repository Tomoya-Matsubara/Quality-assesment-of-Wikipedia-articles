Bangalore is nicknamed the Silicon Valley of India, Silicon City of India, Garden City, Metropolitan City,
India's Most Expensive City, IT/BT Capital Of India. Located on the [[Deccan Plateau]] in the south-eastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is India's [[List of most populous cities in India|third most populous city]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=80&geo=-104&srt=pnan&col=aohdq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&srt=pnan  |title=India: largest cities and towns and statistics of their population

Though historical references to the city predate 900 [[Anno Domini|AD]], a modern written history of continuous settlement exists only from 1537, when [[Kempe Gowda]], who many regard as the architect of modern Bangalore, built a mud-brick fort at the site and established it as a province of the imperial [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. During the [[British Raj]], it became a centre of colonial rule in [[South India]]. The establishment of the [[Bangalore Cantonment]] brought in large numbers of migrants from other parts of the country.

Today as a large city and growing metropolis, Bangalore is home to many of the most well-recognized colleges and research institutions in India.  Numerous public sector [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], software companies, [[aerospace]], [[telecommunications]], and [[defense industry|defence organisations]] are located in the city. Bangalore is known as the ''[[Silicon Valley of India]]'' because of its position as the nation's leading IT exporter.<ref name=swshare1>{{cite web |url=http://www.iadvisory.com.sg/upload/ups_08july09.html |title=Bangalore: Growth Opportunities in the Silicon Valley of India |accessdate=2009-08-20 |publisher=Internationalisation Advisory}}</ref><ref name=swshare2>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasscom.org/upload/AT_Kearney/Executive_Summary.pdf |title=Location Roadmap for IT-BPO Growth |accessdate=2009-08-20 |publisher=[[NASSCOM]]}}</ref><ref name=swshare3>{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/Karnataka_IT_exports_up_by_52-nid-27902.html |title=Karnataka IT exports up by 52% |accessdate=2009-08-20 |publisher=SiliconIndia.com}}</ref> A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is a major economic and cultural hub and the fastest growing major metropolis in India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/06sld2.htm|work=Rediff News|date=2008-02-06|title=India's 10 fastest growing cities|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name Bangalore is an [[Anglicization|anglicised]] version of the town's name in the [[Kannada language]], ''Benga<U+1E37><U+016B>ru''. The earliest reference to the name  "Bengaluru" was found in a ninth century [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] stone inscription on a "v<U+012B>ra gallu" ({{lang|kn|<U+0CB5><U+0CC0><U+0CB0> <U+0C97><U+0CB2><U+0CCD><U+0CB2><U+0CC1>}})  (literally, "[[hero stone]]", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in [[Begur, India|Begur]], "Bengaluru" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890. It states that the place was part of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga Kingdom]] until 1004 and was known as "Bengaval-uru", the "City of Guards" in [[Halegannada]] (Old Kannada.<ref name=OtherNames>K. Chandramouli. [http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/25/stories/2002072500270200.htm "The City of Boiled Beans",] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 2006. The Hindu Group. 25 July 2002</ref> An article, published in ''[[The Hindu]]'', states:<blockquote>An inscription, dating back to 890 CE, shows Bangalore is over 1,000 years old. But it stands neglected at the Parvathi Nageshwara Temple in Begur near the city... written in Hale Kannada (Old Kannada) of the 9th century CE, the epigraph refers to a Bengaluru war in 890 in which Buttanachetty, a servant of Nagatta, died. Though this has been recorded by historian R. Narasimhachar in his Epigraphia of Carnatica (Vol. 10 supplementary), no efforts have been made to preserve it.<ref name=TheHindu>[http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/20/stories/2004082016400300.htm "Inscription reveals Bangalore is over 1,000 years old"].

An apocryphal, though popular, anecdote recounts that the 11th-century [[Hoysala]] king [[Veera Ballala II]], while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" ({{lang-kn|<U+0CAC><U+0CC6><U+0C82><U+0CA6><U+0C95><U+0CBE><U+0CB3><U+0CC2><U+0CB0><U+0CC1>}}) (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengal<U+016B>ru".<ref name="Bendakaaluru">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/Oct302006/index20581420061029.asp|title=Many miles to go from Bangalore to Bengaluru|author=Vijesh Kamath|publisher=[[Deccan Herald]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref><ref name=gandubhoomi />

[[Image:Bangalore LadyCurzonHospital.jpg|thumb|Lady [[Curzon]] hospital in the Bangalore Cantonment was established in 1864 and later named after the first wife of the [[Viceroy]] of India, [[Lord Curzon]].]]
{{Main|History of Bangalore}}
After centuries of the rule of the Western [[Gangas]], Bangalore was captured by the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] in 1024 AD which later passed on to the Chalukya-cholas in 1070. In 1116 the [[Hoysala Empire]], overthrew the Cholas and extended its rule over Bangalore. Modern Bangalore was founded by a [[vassal]] of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda I, who built a mud-brick fort and a [[Nandi Temple]] in the proximity of modern Bangalore in 1537. Yelahanka is one of the oldest towns in Karnataka and it is believed that it has a history of more than 500 years. It is the home town for the ruling king called Kempegowda (under a provision given by Krishnadevaraya) who built Bangalore City. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his "gandubh<U+016B>mi" or "Land of Heroes".<ref name=gandubhoomi>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060919220936/http://www.bangaloreit.in/html/aboutbng/history.htm "About Bangalore - History"]. Department of IT and Biotechnology. 2006. Government of Karnataka.</ref>

Within [[Bangalore Fort]], the town was divided into smaller divisions <U+2013> each called a "pete" ({{IPA-all|pe<U+02D0>te<U+02D0>}}). The town had two main streets <U+2013> Chikkapete Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapete Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapete Square <U+2014> the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built four famous towers that marked Bangalore's boundary. Myth says that the city would befall great calamity if it extended beyond these four towers.<ref name=bglrHist2>Vagale, Uday Kumar. {{PDFlink|[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172004-231956/unrestricted/4.pdf "Public Space in Bangalore: Present and Future Projections"]|773&nbsp;KB}}. Digital Libraries and Archives. 2006. Virginia Tech. 27 April 2004.</ref>
During the Vijayanagara rule, Bangalore was also referred to as "Devar<U+0101>yanagara" and "Kaly<U+0101>napura" ("Auspicious City").
[[Image:Bangalore Palace.jpg|thumb|[[Bangalore Palace]], built in 1887, was home to the [[Kingdom of Mysore|rulers of Mysore]]]]
After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. In 1638, a large [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]] army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by [[Shahaji|Shahji Bhonsle]] defeated Kempe Gowda III and Bangalore was given to Shahaji as a [[jagir]]. In 1687, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] general Kasim Khan defeated [[Ekoji I]]/Venkoji, son of Shahaji, and then sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673<U+2013>1704) of Mysore for 300,000 rupees.<ref name=ekoji>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/02/22/stories/2005022201010300.htm|title=The bean city|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|author=S.

The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son [[Tippu Sultan]], known as the Tiger of Mysore.

Bangalore was eventually incorporated into the [[British India]]n Empire after Tippu Sultan was defeated and killed in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1799). The British returned administrative control of the Bangalore "p<U+0113>t<U+0113>" to the [[Maharaja]] of Mysore, choosing only to retain the [[Cantonment]] under their jurisdiction. The 'Residency' of Mysore State was first established at Mysore in 1799 and later shifted to Bangalore in the year 1804. It was abolished in the year 1843 only to be revived in 1881 at Bangalore and to be closed down permanently in 1947, with Indian independence. The British, found it easier to recruit employees in the [[Madras Presidency]] and relocate them to cantonment area during this period. The Kingdom of Mysore relocated its capital from [[Mysore]] city to Bangalore in 1831.<ref name=bglrHist3>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/M/MY/MYSORE_CAPITAL_.htm "Mysore (Capital)".] [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref>
Two important developments during this period contributed to the rapid growth of the city: the introduction of telegraph connections and a rail connection to [[Madras]] in 1864.
[[Image:Bangalore1924 map.gif|thumb|Bangalore city map, circa 1924 from "Murray's 1924 Handbook".]]

In the 19th century, Bangalore essentially became a [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|Twin city]], with the "p<U+0113>t<U+0113>", whose residents were predominantly [[Kannadiga]]s, and the "cantonment" created by the British, whose residents were predominantly [[Tamil people|Tamils]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172004-231956/unrestricted/4.pdf |title=Public Space in Bangalore: Present and Future Projections (Chapter 8, Page 17)|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref> Bangalore was hit by a [[Bubonic plague|plague]] epidemic in 1898 that dramatically reduced its population. New extensions in [[Malleshwara]] and [[Basavanagudi]] were developed in the north and south of the p<U+0113>t<U+0113>. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordinate anti-plague operations, and a health officer was appointed to the city in 1898. In 1906, Bangalore became the first city in India to have electricity, powered by the [[hydroelectric]] plant situated in [[Shivanasamudra]]. Bangalore's reputation as the Garden City of India began in 1927 with the [[Silver Jubilee]] celebrations of the rule of [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV]]. Several projects such as the construction of parks, public buildings and hospitals were instituted to beautify the city. After Indian independence in August 1947, Bangalore remained in the new [[Mysore State]] of which the Maharaja of Mysore was the [[Rajapramukh]].

Public sector employment and education provided opportunities for Kannadigas from the rest of the state to migrate to the city. Bangalore experienced rapid growth in the decades 1941<U+2013>51 and 1971<U+2013>81 , which saw the arrival of many immigrants from northern Karnataka. By 1961, Bangalore had become the sixth largest city in India, with a population of 1,207,000.<ref name=bglrHist2>Digital Libraries and Archives</ref> In the decades that followed, Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the establishment of private companies such as [[MICO|Motor Industries Company]] (MICO; a subsidiary of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]]), which set up its manufacturing plant in the city. Bangalore experienced a growth in its [[real estate]] market in the 1980s and 1990s, spurred by capital investors from other parts of the country who converted Bangalore's large plots and colonial [[bungalow]]s into multi-storied apartments.<ref name=realestate>Benjamin, Solomon. {{PDFlink|[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN020773.pdf "Governance, economic settings and poverty in Bangalore"]|149&nbsp;KB}}.Environment&Urbanization Vol 12 No 1 2006. United Nations Public Administration. 1 April 2000.</ref> In 1985, [[Texas Instruments]] became the first [[multinational corporation]] to set up base in Bangalore. Other information technology companies followed suit and by the end of the 20th century, Bangalore had firmly established itself as the ''[[Silicon Valley]] of India''.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Bangalore Metropolitan Environment}}
[[Image:BangaloreLake.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hesaraghatta Lake]] in Bangalore]]
Bangalore lies in the southeast of the [[South India]]n state of Karnataka. It is in the heart of the Mysore Plateau (a region of the larger [[Precambrian]] Deccan Plateau) at an average elevation of 920&nbsp;m (3,018&nbsp;ft). It is positioned at {{Coord|12.97|N|77.56|E|}} and covers an area of 741&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (286&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]<U+00B2>).<ref name="area">{{cite web |url=http://www.kar.nic.in/finance/bud2007/bs07e.pdf |title=Finance Budget for 2007-08 |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=2007-06-28|format=PDF}}</ref> The majority of the city of Bangalore lies in the [[Bangalore Urban]] district of Karnataka and the surrounding rural areas are a part of the [[Bangalore Rural]] district. The region consisting the Bangalore Urban and Rural districts is known as the [[Bangalore (region)]]. The Government of Karnataka has carved out the new district of [[Ramanagara]] from the old Bangalore Rural district.

The topology of Bangalore is flat except for a central [[ridge]] running [[North-northeast|NNE]]-[[South-southwest|SSW]]. The highest point is [[Vidyaranyapura]] [[Doddabettahalli]], which is 962&nbsp;m (3,156&nbsp;ft) and lies on this ridge.<ref name=bglrGeo>[http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/wetlands/sarea.html "Studyarea- Bangalore"]. Centre for Ecological Sciences. 2006. Indian Institute of Science.</ref>
No major rivers run through the city, though the [[Arkavathy River|Arkavathi]] and [[South Pennar river|South Pennar]] cross paths at the [[Nandi Hills, India|Nandi Hills]], 60&nbsp;km (37&nbsp;mi.) to the north. [[River Vrishabhavathi]], a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises within the city at Basavanagudi and flows through the city. The rivers Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi together carry much of Bangalore's [[sewage]]. A [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] system, constructed in 1922, covers 215&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (133&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) of the city and connects with five [[sewage treatment]] centers located in the periphery of Bangalore.<ref name=sewage>{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar112004/metro1.asp |title= "Each drop of water counts" |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070311005340/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar112004/metro1.asp |archivedate=2007-03-11}} [[Deccan Herald]], 2006.

In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the earlier half of 20th century, the Nandi Hills [[waterworks]] was commissioned by [[Mirza Ismail|Sir Mirza Ismail]] ([[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] of Mysore, 1926<U+2013>41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city. Currently, the river [[Kaveri]] provides around 80% of the total water supply to the city with the remaining 20% being obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta
reservoirs of the Arkavathi river.<ref name="watersup">{{cite web|url=http://bwssb.org/help_faq.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060206121846/http://bwssb.org/help_faq.html|archivedate=2006-02-06|title=FAQ|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> Bangalore receives 800 million&nbsp;[[liter|litres]] (211 million&nbsp;[[US gallon]]s) of water a day, more than any other Indian city.<ref name=bglrWater>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=8dc55aa2-693c-49f9-a954-28f811fb5d68 "Thirsty Bangalore seeks divine help"].

However, Bangalore sometimes does face water shortages, especially during the summer season- more so in the years of low rainfall. A [[random sample|random sampling]] study of the [[Air Quality Index|Air Quality Index (AQI)]] of twenty stations within the city indicated scores that ranged from 76 to 314, suggesting heavy to severe air pollution around areas of traffic concentration.<ref name=EIA>{{PDFlink|[http://web.archive.org/web/20060320001853/http://www.bmrtl.com/EIA.PDF "Environmental Impact Analysis"]|362&nbsp;KB}}.

Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and [[water tank]]s, the largest of which are Madivala tank, [[Hebbal]] lake, Ulsoor lake and [[Sankey Tank]]. Groundwater occurs in [[silt]]y to [[sand]]y layers of the [[alluvial]] sediments. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes [[granite]]s, [[gneiss]]es and [[migmatite]]s, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red [[laterite]] and red, fine [[loam]]y to [[clay]]ey soils.<ref name="EIA"/>

[[Vegetation]] in the city is primarily in the form of large [[deciduous]] [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] and minority [[coconut]] trees. Though Bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone II (a stable zone), it has experienced quakes of magnitude as high as 4.5.<ref name="quake">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/jan/30inter.htm|title=The Rediff Interview/ Dr S K Srivastav, additional director general, Indian Meteorological Department|publisher=[Rediff.com]|author=Onkar Singh|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
