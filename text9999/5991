The '''Galaxiidae''', also known by the anglicised name as '''galaxiids''',  are a family of mostly small freshwater [[fish]] in the [[southern hemisphere]]. The majority of species live in [[Australia]] or [[New Zealand]], some are also found in [[South Africa]], [[South America]], [[Lord Howe Island]], [[New Caledonia]] and the [[Falkland Islands]]. One of the galaxiid species, the [[common galaxias]] (''[[Galaxias maculatus]]''), is probably the most widely naturally distributed freshwater fish in the southern hemisphere.  They are cool water species, found in [[temperate]] [[latitude]]s, with only one species known from [[sub-tropical]] habitat.<ref name=McD>McDowall, R.M.  (2006)  Crying wolf, crying foul, or crying shame: alien salmonids and a biodiversity crisis in the southern cool-temperate galaxioid fishes?  ''Rev Fish Biol Fisheries'' '''16:''' 233<U+2013>422.</ref>  Many specialise in living in cold, high altitude [[upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|upland]] rivers, streams and lakes.

Some galaxiids live in freshwater all their lives but many have a partially marine life cycle. In these cases, [[larva]]e are hatched in a river but are washed downstream to the ocean, later returning to rivers as juveniles to complete their development to full adulthood. This pattern differs from that of [[salmon]], which only return to freshwater to breed, and is described as [[fish migration|amphidromous]].<ref name=EoF>{{cite book |editor=In: Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N. |author= McDowall, Robert M.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|page= 117|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}</ref>

Freshwater galaxiid species are gravely threatened by exotic [[salmonid]] species, particularly  [[trout]] species, which prey upon galaxiids and compete with them for food.  Exotic salmonids have been recklessly introduced to many different landmasses (e.g. Australia, New Zealand), with no thought as to impacts on native fish, or attempts to preserve salmonid-free habitats for them.  Numerous localised extinctions of galaxiid species have been caused by the introduction of exotic salmonids and a number of freshwater galaxiid species are threatened with overall extinction by exotic salmonids.<ref name=McD/>

==== New Zealand ====
Twenty-two species of galaxiids have been discovered in New Zealand. Most of these live in freshwater all their lives. However, the larvae of five species of the ''Galaxias'' genus develop in the ocean where they form part of the plankton and return to rivers and streams as juveniles (whitebait) where they develop and remain as adults. All ''Galaxias'' species found in New Zealand are endemic, except for ''[[Galaxias brevipinnis]]'' (koaro) and ''[[Galaxias maculatus]]'' (inanga).

== Fishing ==
The juveniles of those galaxiids that develop in the ocean and then move into rivers for their adult life are caught as [[whitebait]] while moving upstream and are much valued as a delicacy. Adult galaxiids may be caught for food but they are generally not large.  In some cases their exploitation may be banned (i.e. New Zealand) unless available to [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|indigenous]] tribes.

In addition to serious impacts from exotic trout species, Australian adult galaxiids suffer a disregard from anglers for being "too small" and "not being trout".  This is despite the fact that several Australian galaxiid species, though smallish, grow to a sufficient size to be catchable and readily take wet and dry flies, and that one of these species <U+2014> the [[spotted galaxias]] <U+2014> was keenly fished for in Australia before the introduction of exotic trout species.  A handful of fly-fishing exponents in Australia are rediscovering the pleasure of catching (and releasing) these fascinating{{Says who|date=April 2010}} Australian native fish on ultra-light fly-fishing tackle.
