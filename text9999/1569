'''Mass killings occurred under some Communist regimes''' during the twentieth century with an estimated death toll numbering between 85 & 100 million.<ref name="Courtois1999Introduction">[[#Courtois1999Introduction|Courtois (1999) "Introduction"]] p. 4: USSR: 20 million deaths; China: 65 million deaths; Vietnam: 1 million deaths; North Korea: 2 million deaths; Cambodia: 2 million deaths; Eastern Europe: 1 million deaths; Latin America: 150,000 deaths; Africa: 1.7 million deaths; Afghanistan: 1.5 million deaths; the international Communist movement and Communist parties not in power: about 10,000 deaths.</ref> Scholarship focuses on the causes of mass killings in single societies, though some claims of common causes for mass killings have been made.  Some higher estimates of mass killings include not only mass murders or executions that took place during the elimination of political opponents, [[civil war]]s, [[terror]] campaigns, and [[land reform]]s, but also lives lost due to war, famine, disease, and exhaustion in labor camps. There are scholars who believe that government policies and mistakes in management contributed to these calamities, and, based on that conclusion combine all these deaths under the categories "mass killings", democide, politicide, "classicide", or loosely defined genocide.  According to these scholars, the total death toll of the mass killings defined in this way amounts to many tens of millions; however, the validity of this approach is questioned by other scholars. As of 2011, academic consensus has not been achieved on causes of large scale killings by states, including by states governed by communists. In particular, the number of comparative studies suggesting causes is limited.  The highest death tolls that have been documented in communist states occurred in the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]], in the [[People's Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]], and in [[Cambodia]] under the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The estimates of the number of non-combatants killed by these three regimes alone range from a low of 21 million to a high of 70 million.{{Dubious|date=February 2011}}<ref>[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 91.</ref> There have also been killings on a smaller scale in North Korea, Vietnam, and some Eastern European and African countries.

== Terminology ==
{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}
'''Communist regimes''' "Communist regimes" refers to those countries who declared themselves to be socialist states under the Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, or Maoist definition (in other words, "[[communist state]]s") at some point in their history.

Scholars use several different terms to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants.<ref>[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 9: "Mass killing and Genocide. No generally accepted terminology exists to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants."</ref><ref name="wheat_scale"/> The following have been used to describe killing by Communist governments:

'''Genocide''' Under the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[Genocide#Genocide_as_a_crime|crime of genocide]] does not apply to the mass killing of political and social groups. Protection of political groups was eliminated from the UN resolution after a second vote, because many states, including Stalin's USSR,<ref>[[#Jones2010Genocide|Jones (2010) ''Genocide'']] p. 137.</ref> anticipated that clause to apply unneeded limitations to their right to suppress internal disturbances.<ref>Beth van Schaack. The Crime of Political Genocide: Repairing the Genocide Convention's Blind Spot. ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 106, No. 7 (May, 1997), pp. 2259<U+2013>2291</ref>

'''Politicide''' The term "[[politicide]]" is used to describe the killing of political or economic groups that would otherwise be covered by the Genocide Convention.<ref name="harffgurr">{{Cite journal|last=Harff|first=Barbara|first2=Ted R.|year=1988|title=Toward Empirical Theory of Genocides and Politicides: Identification and Measurement of Cases since 1945|volume=32|pages=359<U+2013>371|journal=}}</ref> Manus I. Midlarsky uses the term "politicide" to describe an arc of mass killings from the western parts of the Soviet Union to China and Cambodia.<ref>[[#Midlarsky2005Killingtrap|Midlarsky (2005) ''Killing trap'']] p. 310: "Indeed, an arc of Communist politicide can be traced from the western portions of the Soviet Union to China and on to Cambodia."</ref> In his book ''The killing trap: genocide in the twentieth century'' Midlarsky raises similarities between the killings of Stalin and [[Pol Pot]].<ref>[[#Midlarsky2005Killingtrap|Midlarsky (2005) ''Killing trap'']] p.321.</ref>

'''Democide''' [[R. J. Rummel]] coined the term "[[democide]]", which includes genocide, politicide, and [[mass murder]].<ref name=Totten>{{cite book|last=Totten|first=Samuel|title=Dictionary of Genocide: A-L|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-34642-2|pages=106}}</ref>  [[Helen Fein]] has termed the mass state killings in the Soviet Union and Cambodia as "genocide and democide."<ref>{{Cite book|title= Genocide: a sociological perspective; Contextual and Comparative Studies I: Ideological Genocides; |last=Fein |first=Helen |authorlink=Helen Fein |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |location= |isbn=9780803988293 |page=75 |pages= |url= |chapter=Soviet and Communist genocides and 'Democide'|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=n4TaAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Soviet+and+Communist+Genocides%22&dq=%22Soviet+and+Communist+Genocides%22|accessdate=}}</ref> Frank Wayman and Atsushi Tago have shown the significance of terminology in that, depending on the use of [[democide]] (generalised state-sponsored killing) or [[politicide]] (eliminating groups who are politically opposed) as the criterion for inclusion in a data-set, statistical analyses seeking to establish a connection between mass killings can produce very different results, including the significance or otherwise of regime type.{{Page needed|date=July 2010}}<ref name="Tago">{{Cite journal|first1=FW|last1=Wayman|first2=A|last2=Tago|title=Explaining the onset of mass killing, 1949<U+2013>87|journal=Journal of Peace Research Online|year=2009|pages=1<U+2013>17}}</ref>

'''Crime against humanity''' Jacques Semelin and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]]<ref>[[#Semelin2009PurifyandDestroy|Semelin (2009) ''Purify and Destroy'']] p. 344.</ref> believe that "[[crime against humanity]]" is more appropriate than "genocide" or "politicide" when speaking of violence by Communist regimes.<ref>[[#Semelin2009PurifyandDestroy|Semelin (2009) ''Purify and Destroy'']] p. 318.</ref>

'''Classicide''' Michael Mann has proposed the term "classicide" to mean the "intended mass killing of entire social classes".<ref>[[#Mann2005DarkSideofDemocracy|Mann (2005) ''Dark Side of Democracy'']] p. 17.</ref>

'''Terror''' Stephen Wheatcroft notes that, in the case of the Soviet Union, terms such as "the terror", "the purges", and "repression" (the latter mostly in common Russian) colloquially refer to the same events and he believes the most neutral terms are "repression" and "mass killings".<ref name="wheat_scale">Stephen Wheatcroft.

'''Mass killing''' This term has been defined by Benjamin Valentino as "the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants", where a "massive number" is defined as at least 50,000 intentional deaths over the course of five years or less.<ref>Benjamin Valentino, Paul Huth, Dylan Bach-Lindsay, (2004), "Draining the Sea: mass killing and guerrilla warfare," ''International Organization'' 58,2 (375<U+2013>407): p. 387.</ref> He applies this definition to the cases of Stalin's USSR, the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] under Mao, and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, while admitting that mass killings on a smaller scale also appear to have been carried out by regimes in [[North Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Africa]].<ref>[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 91</ref>

Klas-G<U+00F6>ran Karlsson writes that "Ideologies are systems of ideas, which cannot commit crimes independently.

According to [[Rudolph Joseph Rummel]], the killings done by communist regimes can be explained with the marriage between absolute power and an absolutist ideology <U+2013> [[Marxism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pioneers of genocide studies |last=Totten |first=Samuel |authorlink= |coauthors=Steven L.

"Of all religions, secular and otherwise," Rummel positions Marxism as "by far the bloodiest <U+2013> bloodier than the [[Catholic Inquisition]], the various Catholic crusades, and the [[Thirty Years War]] between Catholics and Protestants. In practice, Marxism has meant bloody terrorism, deadly purges, lethal prison camps and murderous forced labor, fatal deportations, man-made famines, extrajudicial executions and fraudulent show trials, outright mass murder and genocide."<ref name = "Killing Machine">{{Cite web|last1=Rummel|first1=RJ|url=http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=41944|title=The killing machine that is Marxism|publisher=[[WorldNetDaily]]|date=15 December 2004|accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> He writes that in practice the Marxists saw the construction of their utopia as "a war on poverty, exploitation, imperialism and inequality <U+2013> and, as in a real war, noncombatants would unfortunately get caught in the battle. There would be necessary enemy casualties: the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, 'wreckers', intellectuals, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, the rich and landlords. As in a war, millions might die, but these deaths would be justified by the end, as in the defeat of Hitler in World War II.

In his book [[Red Holocaust (2009 book)|''Red Holocaust'']], [[Steven Rosefielde]] argues that communism's internal contradictions "caused to be killed" approximately 60 million people and perhaps tens of millions more, and that this "Red Holocaust" <U+2013> the peacetime mass killings and other related crimes against humanity perpetrated by Communist leaders such as [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Kim Il Sung]], [[Mao Tse-tung]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Pol Pot]]<U+2014>should be the centerpiece of any net assessment of communism. He states that the aforementioned leaders are "collectively guilty of holocaust-scale felonious homicides."<ref>[[#Rosefielde2009RedHolocaust|Rosefielde (2009) ''Red Holocaust'']] pp. 1, 7.</ref>

[[Robert Conquest]] stressed that Stalin's purges were not contrary to the principles of [[Leninism]], but rather a natural consequence of the system established by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], who personally ordered the killing of local groups of class enemy hostages.<ref>[[#Conquest2007GreatTerror|Conquest (2007) ''Great Terror'']] p. xxiii.</ref> [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], architect of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] and later head of the Presidential Commission for the Victims of Political Repression, elaborates on this point, stating that "The truth is that in punitive operations Stalin did not think up anything that was not there under Lenin: executions, hostage taking, concentration camps, and all the rest."<ref>[[#Yakovlev2002CenturyofViolence|Yakovlev (2002) ''Century of Violence'']] p. 20.</ref> Historian [[Robert Gellately]] concurs, saying: "To put it another way, Stalin initiated very little that Lenin had not already introduced or previewed."<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Barry|last1=Ray|url=http://www.fsu.edu/news/2007/09/11/gellately.book/|title=FSU professor's 'Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler' sheds new light on three of the 20th century's bloodiest rulers|publisher=[[Florida State University]]|year=2007}}</ref> Said Lenin to his colleagues in the Bolshevik government: "If we are not ready to shoot a saboteur and White Guardist, what sort of revolution is that?"<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Sheila|last1=Fitzpatrick|title=The Russian Revolution|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2008|isbn=0199237670|page=77}}</ref>

[[Anne Applebaum]] asserts that, "without exception, the Leninist belief in the [[one-party state]] was and is characteristic of every communist regime," and "the [[Bolshevik]] use of violence was repeated in every Communist revolution."

In ''The Lost Literature of Socialism'', literary historian George Watson saw socialism as conservative, a reaction against liberalism and an attempt to return to antiquity and hierarchy.  He states that the writings of [[Friedrich Engels]] and others show that "the Marxist theory of history required and demanded genocide for reasons implicit in its claim that feudalism, which in advanced nations was already giving place to capitalism, must in its turn be superseded by socialism. Entire nations would be left behind after a workers' revolution, feudal remnants in a socialist age, and since they could not advance two steps at a time, they would have to be killed.

Eric D. Weitz says that the mass killing in communist states are a natural consequence of the failure of the rule of law, seen commonly during periods of social upheaval in the 20th century.

[[Stephen Hicks]] of [[Rockford College]] ascribes the violence characteristic of twentieth-century [[Socialism|socialist]] rule to these collectivist regimes' abandonment of protections of [[civil rights]] and rejection of the values of [[civil society]]. Hicks writes that whereas "in practice every liberal capitalist country has a solid record for being humane, for by and large respecting rights and freedoms, and for making it possible for people to put together fruitful and meaningful lives", in socialism "practice has time and again proved itself more brutal than the worst dictatorships prior to the twentieth century.

Benjamin Valentino writes that mass killings strategies are chosen by Communists to economically dispossess large numbers of people.<ref>[[#Valentino2005|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] pp. 34<U+2013>37.</ref> "Social transformations of this speed and magnitude have been associated with mass killing for two primary reasons. First, the massive social dislocations produced by such changes have often led to economic collapse, epidemics, and, most important, widespread famines. ... The second reason that communist regimes bent on the radical transformation of society have been linked to mass killing is that the revolutionary changes they have pursued have clashed inexorably with the fundamental interests of large segments of their populations. Few people have proved willing to accept such far-reaching sacrifices without intense levels of coersion."<ref>[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] pp. 93<U+2013>94.</ref>

According to Jacques Semelin, "communist systems emerging in the twentieth century ended up destroying their own populations, not because they planned to annihilate them as such, but because they aimed to restructure the 'social body' from top to bottom, even if that meant purging it and recarving it to suit their new Promethean political ''imaginaire''."<ref>[[#Semelin2009PurifyandDestroy|Semelin (2009) ''Purify and Destroy']]' p. 331.</ref>

====Secular values====
Some proponents of traditional ethical standards and religious faith argue that the killings were at least partly the result of a weakening of faith and the unleashing of the radical values of the [[European Enlightenment]] upon the modern world. Observing this kind of trend in critical scholarship, the [[University of Oklahoma]] political scientist Allen D. Hertzke zooms in on the ideas of British Catholic writer and historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] and writes that {{cquote|[A] shift in intellectual mood has come from the critique of the perceived failures and blinders of the secular project. To be sure, this critique is not universally shared, but a vast scholarship, along with a proliferating array of opinion journals and think tank symposia, catalog the fallout from the abandonment of transcendent societal anchors. Epitomizing this thought is Paul Johnson's magisterial book ''Modern Times'', which attacks the common Enlightenment assumption that ''less'' religious faith necessarily equals ''more'' human freedom or democracy. The collapse of the religious impulse among the educated classes in Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century, he argues, left a vacuum that was filled by politicians wielding power under the banner of totalitarian ideologies{{ndash}}whether '[[blood and soil]]' [[Fascism]] or [[atheistic]] [[Communism]]. Thus the attempt to live without [[God]] made idols of politics and produced the century's 'gangster statesmen'{{ndash}}Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot{{ndash}}whose 'unappeasable appetite for controlling mankind' unleashed unimaginable horrors. Or as [[T.S. Eliot]] puts it, 'If you will not have God (and he is a jealous God) you should pay your respects to Hitler or Stalin.'<ref name = "Hertzke 2006, p. 24">{{Cite book|last1=Hertzke|first=Allen D.|year=2006|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EkIvbxefBNsC&pg=PA24&dq=Stalin+Mao+Pol+Pot&q=unappeasable%20appetite%20for%20controlling%20mankind|page=24|isbn=9780742547322|work=Freeing God's Children: The Unlikely Alliance for Global Human Rights|title=Freeing God's Children: The Unlikely Alliance for Global Human Rights}}</ref>}}

====Personal responsibility====
The [[Russian history|Russian]] and [[world history]] scholar John M. Thompson describes the system of terror developed during Stalin's time as "puzzling"; surveying Russian history, he posits the height of the socialist bloodletting in the Soviet Union in the 1930s as a function of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's personality{{ndash}}specifically contending that {{cquote|Attempts to explain this nightmarish period as Stalin's consolidation and reshaping of power, or the cleansing of the party as an evolving component of the Stalinist system somehow run amok, or as Stalin's coldly calculated effort to ready the country for war and ensure that he would have a free hand in foreign policy are, singly or even taken together, simply not convincing. Since Stalin destroyed both the records and most of the high officials involved, we will probably never know precisely what led to the purges and terror. Rational and policy considerations undoubtedly there were, but any persuasive explanation of this era must take account of Stalin's personality and outlook. Much of what occurred only makes sense if it stemmed in part from the disturbed mentality, pathological cruelty, and extreme paranoia of Stalin himself. Insecure, despite having established a dictatorship over the party and country, hostile and defensive when confronted with criticism of the excesses of collectivization and the sacrifices required by high-tempo industrialization, and deeply suspicious that past, present, and even yet unknown future opponents were plotting against him, Stalin began to act as a person beleaguered. He soon struck back at enemies, real or imaginary.<ref name = "John H.

==Comparison to other mass killings==

==States where mass killings have occurred==
=== Soviet Union ===
After the Soviet Union dissolved, evidence from the Soviet archives became available, containing official records of the execution of approximately 800,000 prisoners under Stalin for either political or criminal offenses, around 1.7 million deaths in the [[Gulag]]s and some 390,000 deaths during kulak [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced resettlement]]{{ndash}} for a total of about 3 million officially recorded victims in these categories.<ref>Stephen G. Wheatcroft, "Victims of Stalinism and the Soviet Secret Police: The Comparability and Reliability of the Archival Data. Not the Last Word", Source: Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 51, No. 2 (Mar., 1999), pp. 315<U+2013>345, gives the following numbers: During 1921<U+2013>53, the number of sentences was (political convictions): sentences, 4,060,306; death penalties, 799,473; camps and prisons, 2,634397; exile, 413,512; other, 215,942. In addition, during 1937<U+2013>52 there were 14,269,753 non-political sentences, among them 34,228 death penalties, 2,066,637 sentences for 0<U+2013>1 year, 4,362,973 for 2<U+2013>5 years, 1,611,293 for 6<U+2013>10 years, and 286,795 for more than 10 years.

By 1987, about 80% of the country's territory was permanently controlled by neither the pro-Communist government (and supporting Soviet troops) nor by the armed opposition. To tip the balance, the Soviet Union used a tactic that was a combination of "scorched earth" policy and "migratory genocide": by systematically burning the crops and destroying villages in rebel provinces, as well as by reprisal bombing of entire villages suspected of harbouring or supporting the resistance, the Soviets tried to force the local population to move to the Soviet controlled territory, thereby depriving the armed opposition of their support.<ref>Joseph Collins.

===Mass deportations of ethnic minorities===
{{Main|Population transfer in the Soviet Union}}

The Soviet government during [[Stalin]]'s rule conducted a [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|series of deportations]] on an enormous scale that significantly affected the ethnic map of the USSR. Deportations took place under extremely harsh conditions, often in cattle carriages, with hundreds of thousands of deportees dying en route.<ref name="Boobbyer">Boobbyer, Phillip (2000), The Stalin Era, Routledge, ISBN 0767900561 p. 130</ref> Some experts estimate the number of deaths from the deportations in certain cases could be as high as one in three.<ref>In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia.'' Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. ISBN 0871139065. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe.'' Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001. ISBN 0674009940. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929<U+2013>1953.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. ISBN 0719063779. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would have the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C. ''Stalin and German Communism: A Study in the Origins of the State Party.'' Edison, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2006. ISBN 0878558225</ref><ref>Conquest, Robert. ''The Nation Killers.'' New York: Macmillan, 1970. ISBN 0333105753</ref> Regarding the fate of the Crimean Tatars, Amir Weiner of Stanford University writes that the policy could be classified as "[[ethnic cleansing]]". In the book ''Century of Genocide'', Lyman H Legters writes "We cannot properly speak of a completed genocide, only of a process that was genocidal in its potentiality."<ref>Samuel Totten, William S. Parsons, Israel W. Charny. ''Century of Genocide: Eyewitness Accounts and Critical Views.'' Garland, 1997 ISBN 0815323530 p. 120</ref>

===Tibet===
According to [[The Black Book of Communism]], the Chinese Communists carried out a [[cultural genocide]] against the Tibetans. Jean-Louis Margolin states that the killings were proportionally larger in Tibet than China proper, and that "one can legitimately speak of genocidal massacres because of the numbers involved."<ref name="Margolin">Jean-Louis Margolin "China: a long march into night" in ''[[#Courtois1999BlackBook|The Black Book]]'' pp. 545<U+2013>546.</ref> According to the [[Dalai Lama]] and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]], "Tibetans were not only shot, but also were beaten to death, crucified, burned alive, drowned, mutilated, starved, strangled, hanged, boiled alive, buried alive, drawn and quartered, and beheaded."<ref name="Margolin"/>

[[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]], a Canadian scholar specializing in genocide, notes that after the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the Chinese authorized [[struggle session]]s against reactionaries, during which "...communist cadres denounced, tortured, and frequently executed [[enemies of the people]]." These sessions resulted in 92,000 deaths out of a population of about 6 million. These deaths, Jones stresses, may be seen not only as a genocide but also as 'eliticide' <U+2013> "targeting the better educated and leadership oriented elements among the Tibetan population."<ref>[[#Jones2010Genocide|Jones (2010) ''Genocide'']] pp. 95<U+2013>96.</ref>

===Inclusion of famine as killing===
The journalist and author [[Seamus Milne]] has questioned whether deaths from famine should be considered equivalent to state killings, since the demographic data used to estimate famine deaths may not be reliable.  He argues that, if they are to be, then Britain would have to be considered responsible for as many as 30 million deaths in India from famine during the 19th century, and laments that there has been "no such comprehensive indictment of the colonial record".<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/sep/12/highereducation.historyandhistoryofart | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The battle for history | first=Seumas | last=Milne | date=2002-09-12 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>

Benjamin Valentino writes that, "Although not all the deaths due to famine in these cases were intentional, communist leaders directed the worst effects of famine against their suspected enemies and used hunger as a weapon to force millions of people to conform to the directives of the state."<ref>[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 93<U+2013>94.</ref>

[[Daniel Goldhagen]] argues that in some cases, deaths from famine should not be distinguished from mass murder: "Whenever governments have not alleviated famine conditions, political leaders decided ''not to say no'' to mass death <U+2013> in other words, they said ''yes''." He claims that famine was either used or deliberately tolerated by the Soviets, the Germans, the communist Chinese, the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Kenya]], the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] against the [[Ibo people|Ibo]] in Nigeria, Khmer Rouge, communist North Koreans, Ethiopeans in [[Eritrea]], [[Zimbabwe]] against regions of political opposition, and Political Islamists in southern [[Sudan]] and [[Darfur]].<ref name="Gladhagenfamine">[[#Goldhagen2009WorsethanWar|Goldhagen (2009) ''Worse than War'']] pp. 29<U+2013>30.</ref>

==Notable executioners==
[[Major-General]] [[Vasili Blokhin]], Stalin's chief executioner at [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]] prison, personally shot thousands of prisoners and is regarded by some historians as the most prolific executioner in history.<ref>[[#Montefiore2005CourtoftheRedTsar|Montefiore (2005) ''Court of the Red Tsar'']] pp. 197<U+2013>8, 334.</ref><ref>[[#Parrish1996LesserTerror|Parrish (1996) ''Lesser Terror'']] p. 324.</ref>
