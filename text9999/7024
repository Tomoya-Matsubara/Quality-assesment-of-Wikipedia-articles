'''John Joseph "Jack" Doyle''' (October 25, 1869 &ndash; December 31, 1958) was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-[[United States|American]] [[first baseman]] in [[Major League Baseball]] whose career spanned 17 seasons, mainly in the [[National League]].<ref name="baseball-Reference">{{cite web| title = Jack Doyle Stats | work = Baseball-Reference.com | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/d/doyleja01.shtml | accessdate = 2007-07-20 }}</ref>
He was born in [[Killorglin]], [[Ireland]], and [[immigration to the United States|emigrated]] to the U.S. when he was a child, his family settling in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]].<ref name="sabr">{{cite web| title = Jack Doyle Biography | work = SABR.org | url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=3763&bid=640 | accessdate = 2007-07-20 }}</ref>

==Playing career==
After attending [[Fordham University]], he embarked on a baseball career that would last 70 years.  He made his first appearance at the [[major league baseball|major league]] level by signing and playing two years for the [[Columbus Solons]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]. Doyle would play for ten clubs from {{By|1889}}-{{By|1905}}, [[batting average|batting]] .299 in 1,564 games with 516 [[stolen base]]s. He began as a [[catcher]]-[[outfielder]] and became a [[first baseman]] in {{By|1894}}. His best years were in 1894, when he batted .367 for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], and in {{By|1897}}, when he hit .354 with 62 stolen bases for the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]].<ref name="baseball-Reference"/> He is credited with being the first [[pinch-hitter]] in pro ball, with [[Cleveland Spiders|Cleveland]] at [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn]] on June 7, {{By|1892}}. [[Patsy Tebeau]] was the [[manager (baseball)|manager]] and Doyle came through with a game-winning [[single (baseball)|single]].<ref name="sabr"/>

For the {{By|1894}} season, he took over the everyday duties at [[first base]]. Manager [[John Montgomery Ward]] not only make the decision to replace his former teammate and friend [[Roger Connor]], but released him as well. Connor was a very popular player, and this decision drew the ire and scrutiny from the fans and media alike. Ward defended his decision, and claimed the move came down to the fact that he liked Doyle's playing style, describing him as a [[hustler]].<ref>''A Clever Base-Ballist: The Life and Times of John Montgomery Ward,'' pg. 352, by Bryan Di Salvatore</ref> Replacing Connor at first base proved worth the risk as Jack batted .367 that season, and he totaled 100 [[runs batted in]], and stole 42 bases.<ref name="baseball-Reference"/>

==Dirty Jack==
Because of his aggressive playing style, Doyle was known as <U+201C>Dirty Jack,<U+201D> often feuding with [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], [[fan (person)|fans]], opposing players, and even, at times, his own teammates.<ref name="minorleaguebaseball">{{cite web| title = Top 100 Teams | work = minorleaguebaseball.com | url=http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=63 | accessdate = 2007-07-20 }}</ref> On one occasion, in Cincinnati on July 4, {{By|1900}}, while in the 3rd inning of the second game of a doubleheader, Doyle slugged umpire [[Bob Emslie]] after being called out on a steal attempt. Fans jumped from the stands as the two got into it, and players finally separated the two fighters. Two [[police officer|policemen]] chased the fans back into the stands and then [[arrest]]ed and fined Doyle.<ref name="sabr"/> On July 1, {{By|1901}}, when he was being harassed by a [[Polo Grounds]] fan, he jumped into the stands and hit him once with his left hand, reinjuring it after having broken it several weeks earlier.<ref name="baseballlibrary">{{cite web| title = Jack Doyle Chronology | work = The Baseball Library.com | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Jack_Doyle_1869&page=chronology | accessdate = 2007-07-20 }}</ref>

He carried on a lengthy feud with [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] that started when they were teammates at Baltimore. McGraw, of course, had to have the last word. In {{By|1902}}, McGraw was appointed manager of the Giants, and his first act was to release Doyle, even though he was batting .301 and [[fielding percentage|fielding]] .991 at the time. Even with these seemingly out-of-control traits, Doyle was deemed a natural leader and was selected as team captain in New York, Brooklyn and [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago]], and served as an interim manager for the Giants in {{By|1895}} and [[Washington Senators (1891-1899)|Washington Senators]] in {{By|1898}}.<ref name="sabr"/>

==Minor league success==
In 1905, after playing one game with the [[New York Yankees|New York Highlanders]], Doyle became manager of Toledo of the [[Western Association]]. One year later, in {{By|1906}}, he was named the manager of the Des Moines Champions, so named because they won the league championship the previous year, and they won it again under Doyle's helm. Following his championship season at Des Moines, he managed Milwaukee in {{By|1907}}<ref name="minorleaguebaseball"/>

==Other career capacities==
In 1908-09, the only years of his adult life spent outside of baseball, he served as [[police commissioner]] of his hometown of Holyoke.<ref name="sabr"/> Doyle returned to the game as an umpire and worked in the National League for 42 games in {{By|1911}}.<ref name="retrosheet">{{cite web| title = Jack Doyle | work = Retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/D/Pdoylj103.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-17 }}</ref> Later on he would join the [[Chicago Cubs]] as a [[scout (sports)|scout]] in {{By|1920}}. In his many years with the Cubs, Doyle was credited with signing or recommending the acquisition of such stars as [[Gabby Hartnett]], [[Hack Wilson]], [[Billy Herman]], [[Stan Hack]], [[Bill Jurges]], [[Charlie Root]], [[Bill Lee (right-handed pitcher)|Bill Lee]], [[Augie Galan]], [[Riggs Stephenson]] and [[Phil Cavarretta]].<ref name="minorleaguebaseball"/> He remained in that capacity until his death at age 89 on New Year's Eve 1958. He was buried at St. Jerome Cemetery in Holyoke.<ref name="retrosheet"/>

==Honors==
In the [[Irish Baseball League#Other awards|Irish Baseball League]], the annual award for best slugger is named "The 'Dirty' Jack Doyle Silver Slugger Award.
