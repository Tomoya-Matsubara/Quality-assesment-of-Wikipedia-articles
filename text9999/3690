'''Chester Alan Arthur''' (October&nbsp;5, 1829 <U+2013> November&nbsp;18, 1886) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|21st]] [[President of the United States]] (1881<U+2013>1885).  Becoming President after [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|the assassination]] of President [[James A. Garfield]], Arthur struggled to overcome suspicions of his beginnings as a politician from the New York City [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] machine, succeeding at that task by embracing the cause of civil service reform.  His advocacy for, and enforcement of, the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] was the centerpiece of his administration.

Born in [[Fairfield, Vermont]], Arthur grew up in [[upstate New York]] and practiced law in New York City.  He devoted much of his time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the political machine run by New York Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]].  Appointed by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to the lucrative and politically powerful post of [[Collector of the Port of New York]] in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction of the Republican Party.  He was then removed by the new president, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], in 1878 in an effort to reform the federal patronage system in New York.  When James Garfield won the Republican nomination for President in 1880, Arthur was nominated for Vice President to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]] by adding an eastern Stalwart to it.

After just half a year as Vice President, Arthur found himself, unexpectedly, in the [[White House|Executive Mansion]]. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the reform cause that had once led to his expulsion from office.  He signed the Pendleton Act into law, and enforced its provisions vigorously.  He won plaudits for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive and presided over the rebirth of the [[United States Navy]], but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus that had been accumulating since the end of the Civil War.  Suffering from poor health, he made only a limited effort at renomination in 1884 and retired at the close of his term.  As journalist [[Alexander McClure]] would later write, "No man ever entered the Presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur, and no one ever retired ... more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe."<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 420</ref>  Although his failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration far less active than a modern presidency, he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office.  The ''New York World'' summed up Arthur's presidency at his death in 1886: "No duty was neglected in his administration, and no adventurous project alarmed the nation."<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 423</ref>

==Early life==
===Birth and family===
Chester Alan Arthur was born October&nbsp;5, 1829, in [[Fairfield, Vermont]].{{#tag:ref|Some older sources list the date as October&nbsp;5, 1830,<ref>[[#howe|Howe]], p. 5</ref> but biographer [[Thomas C. Reeves]] confirms that this is incorrect: Arthur claimed to be a year younger "out of simple vanity."<ref name=reeves5>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 5</ref>|group=note}}  His father, William Arthur, was born in [[County Antrim]], Ireland, and emigrated to [[Dunham, Quebec|Dunham]], [[Lower Canada]] (in present-day [[Quebec]]) in 1818 or 1819 after graduating from Belfast College.<ref name=reeves4>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 4; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 4</ref>  Arthur's mother, Malvina Stone, was born in Vermont, the daughter of George Washington Stone and Judith Stevens.  Malvina's family was primarily of English descent, and her grandfather, Uriah Stone, fought in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=reeves4/>  Arthur's mother met his father while he was teaching at a school in Dunham, just over the border from her native Vermont, and the two soon married.<ref name=reeves4/>  After their first child, Regina, was born in Dunham, the Arthurs moved around Vermont in quick succession to [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Jericho, Vermont|Jericho]], and [[Waterville, Vermont|Waterville]], as William moved to jobs with different schools.<ref name=reeves4/>  In Waterville, William Arthur departed from his Presbyterian upbringing and joined the [[Free Will Baptist]]s, spending the rest of his life as a minister in that sect.<ref name=reeves4/>  He also became an outspoken abolitionist, which at times made him unpopular with parts of his congregations and contributed to the family's frequent moves.<ref>[[#howe|Howe]], p. 7; [[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 6</ref>  In 1828, the family moved again, to Fairfield, where Chester Alan Arthur was born the following year.<ref name=reeves5/>  He was named "Chester" after Chester Abell, the physician and family friend who assisted in his birth, and "Alan" after his paternal grandfather.{{#tag:ref|Arthur pronounced his middle name with the accent on the second syllable.<ref name=reeves5/>|group=note}}  After Arthur's birth, the family remained in Fairfield until 1832, when the elder Arthur's profession took them on the road again to several towns in Vermont and [[upstate New York]], finally settling in the [[Schenectady]] area.<ref name="reeves7"/>

William Arthur's frequent moves would later form the basis for accusations that Chester Arthur was not a native-born citizen of the United States.  After Arthur was [[United States presidential election, 1880|nominated for Vice President in 1880]], his political opponents suggested that he might be constitutionally ineligible to hold that office.<ref>[[#kara|Karabell]], pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref>  A New York attorney, Arthur P. Hinman, apparently hired by his opponents, explored rumors of Arthur's foreign birth.<ref name=hinman>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 202<U+2013>203</ref>  Hinman initially alleged that Arthur was born in Ireland and did not come to the United States until he was fourteen years old, which would make him ineligible for the Vice Presidency under the United States Constitution's  [[Natural-born-citizen clause of the U.S. Constitution|natural-born citizen clause]].<ref name=hinman/>{{#tag:ref|The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] applies that clause, which specifically restricts presidential eligibility, to would-be vice presidents, as well: "no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President".|group=note}}  When that story did not take root, Hinman spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada, but this claim also failed to gain credence.<ref name=hinman/>

===Education===
Arthur spent some of his childhood years living in [[Perry (village), New York|Perry]] and [[Greenwich (village), New York|Greenwich]], New York. During his time at school, his first political inclinations were to support the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and he joined other young Whigs in support of [[Henry Clay]], even participating in a brawl against those students supporting [[James K. Polk]].<ref name=reeves7>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref>  He also showed his support for the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] by wearing a green coat.<ref name=reeves9>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 9</ref>  Arthur enrolled in [[Union College]] in 1845 where he studied the traditional [[Classical education movement|classical curriculum]].<ref name=reeves7/>    As a senior there in 1848, at age 18, he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and was president of the debate society.<ref name=reeves9/>  During his winter breaks, Arthur taught school in [[Schaghticoke (town), New York|Schaghticoke]].<ref name=reeves9/>

After graduating, Arthur returned to Schaghticoke and taught school full-time, but soon began to pursue an education in the law.<ref name=reeves10>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 10</ref>  While studying law, he continued teaching, moving closer to home by taking a job teaching in [[North Pownal, Vermont|North Pownal]], Vermont.<ref name=reeves10/>  Coincidentally, future President [[James A. Garfield]] would teach penmanship at the same school three years later, but the two did not cross paths.<ref name=reeves11>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 11</ref>  In 1852, Arthur moved again, to [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]], New York, to become the principal of a school at which his sister Malvina was a teacher.<ref name=reeves11/>  After saving enough money, and studying at [[State and National Law School]] in [[Ballston Spa, New York|Ballston Spa]], he moved to New York City the following year to [[Reading law|read law]] at the law office of [[Erastus D. Culver]], an abolitionist lawyer and family friend.<ref>[[#kara|Karabell]], p. 12</ref>  When Arthur was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1854, he joined the firm, which was renamed Culver, Parker, and Arthur.<ref name=reeves14>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 14</ref>

==Early career==
[[File:Chester A Arthur 1859.png|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a young man with a mustache|Arthur as a young lawyer]]

===New York lawyer===
When Arthur joined the firm, Culver and New York attorney [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]] (the grandson of the Founding Father of the [[John Jay|same name]]) were pursuing a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' action against Jonathan Lemmon, a Virginia slaveholder who was passing through New York with his eight slaves.<ref name=lemmon>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>  In ''[[Lemmon v. New York]]'', Culver argued that, as New York law did not permit slavery, any slave arriving in New York was automatically freed.<ref name=lemmon/>  The argument was successful, and after several appeals was upheld by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in 1860.<ref name=lemmon/>  Campaign biographers would later give Arthur much of the credit for the victory; in fact his role was minor, although he was certainly an active participant in the case.<ref name=reeves16>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 16</ref>  In another civil rights case in 1854, Arthur was the lead attorney representing [[Elizabeth Jennings Graham]] after she was denied a seat on a streetcar because she was black.<ref name=reeves16/>  He won the case, and the verdict led to the [[desegregation]] of the New York City streetcar lines.<ref name=reeves16/>

In 1856, Arthur courted [[Ellen Lewis Herndon Arthur|Ellen Herndon]], the daughter of [[William Lewis Herndon]], a Virginia naval officer.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref>  The two were soon engaged to be married.<ref>[[#kara|Karabell]], p. 14</ref>  Later that year, he started a new law partnership with a friend, Henry D. Gardiner, and traveled with him to Kansas to consider purchasing land and setting up a law practice there.<ref name=reeves16/>  At that time, the state was the scene of a [[Bleeding Kansas|brutal struggle]] between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces, and Arthur lined up firmly with the latter.<ref name=reeves17>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp.17<U+2013>18</ref>  The rough frontier life did not agree with the genteel New Yorkers; after three or four months the two young lawyers returned to New York City, where Arthur comforted his fianc<U+00E9>e after her father was lost at sea in the wreck of the [[SS Central America|SS ''Central America'']].<ref name=reeves17/>  In 1859, they were married at [[Calvary Church (Manhattan)|Calvary Episcopal Church]] in Manhattan.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 21</ref>  After his marriage, Arthur devoted his efforts to building his law practice, but also found time to engage in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] politics.<ref name=howe18>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref>

===Civil War===
[[File:Ellen Arthur.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a woman with dark hair|Arthur married [[Ellen Lewis Herndon Arthur|Ellen Herndon]] in 1859.]]
In 1860, Arthur was appointed to the military staff of Governor [[Edwin D. Morgan]].<ref name=howe18/>  The office was a patronage appointment of minor importance until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in April 1861, when New York and the other northern states were faced with raising and equipping armies of a size never before seen in American history.<ref name=howe20>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 20<U+2013>21; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref>  Arthur was given the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] and assigned to the [[quartermaster]] department.<ref name=howe20/>  He was so efficient at housing and outfitting the troops that poured into New York City that he was promoted within the state militia to inspector general in February 1862, and then to quartermaster general that July.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref>  He had an opportunity to serve at the front when the [[9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] elected him [[colonel]] early in the war, but at Governor Morgan's request, he turned it down to remain at his post in New York.<ref>[[#howe|Howe]], p. 25</ref>  The closest Arthur came to the front was when he traveled south to inspect New York troops near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], Virginia, in May 1862, shortly after forces under Major General [[Irwin McDowell]] seized the town during the [[Peninsula Campaign]].<ref name=howe26>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 26<U+2013>27; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref>  That summer, he and other representatives of northern governors met with Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] in New York to coordinate the raising of additional troops, and spent the next few months enlisting New York's quota of 120,000 men.<ref name=howe26/>  Arthur received plaudits for his work, but his post was a political one, and he was relieved of his office in January 1863 when Governor [[Horatio Seymour]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], took office.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 30</ref>

Arthur returned to his law practice in 1863 and the firm of Arthur & Gardiner flourished.<ref>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 30<U+2013>31; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 33<U+2013>34</ref>  Even as his professional life improved, however, Arthur and his wife experienced a personal tragedy as their only child, William, died suddenly that year at the age of three.<ref>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 29<U+2013>30; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref>  The couple took their son's death hard, and when they had another son, Chester Alan Jr., in 1864, they lavished attention on him.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 35</ref>  They would also have a daughter, Ellen, in 1871. Both children survived to adulthood.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 84</ref>  Arthur's political prospects improved along with his law practice when his patron, ex-Governor Morgan, was elected to the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=reeves37>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 37</ref>  He was hired by [[Thomas Murphy (Collector)|Thomas Murphy]], a [[Hatmaking|hatter]] who sold goods to the Union Army, to represent him in Washington. The two became associates within New York Republican party circles, eventually rising in the ranks of the conservative branch of the party dominated by [[Thurlow Weed]].<ref name=reeves37/>  In the [[United States presidential election, 1864|presidential election of 1864]], Arthur and Murphy raised funds from Republicans in New York and attended [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inauguration in 1865]].<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 38</ref>

==New York politician==
===Conkling's machine===
[[File:NYCustomHouseMerchantsExchange.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A columned building with a domed roof|The [[New York Custom House]] (formerly the Merchants' Exchange building) was Arthur's office for seven years.]]
The end of the Civil War meant new opportunities for the men in Morgan's Republican [[Political machine|machine]], including Arthur.<ref name=kara17>[[#kara|Karabell]], p. 17</ref>  Morgan leaned toward the conservative wing of the New York Republican party, as did the men who worked for him, including Weed, Seward (who continued in office under President [[Andrew Johnson]]), and [[Roscoe Conkling]] (an eloquent [[Utica, New York|Utica]] Congressman and rising star in the party).<ref name=kara17/>  Arthur rarely articulated his own political ideas during his time as a part of the machine; as was common at the time, loyalty and hard work on the machine's behalf was more important than actual political sympathies.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 39; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 37</ref>  In 1866, he attempted to secure the position of Naval Officer at the [[New York Custom House]], a lucrative job with few responsibilities, but was unable to do so.<ref name=r40>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref>  Nevertheless, he continued his law practice (now a solo practitionership after Gardiner's death) and his role in politics, becoming a member of the prestigious [[Century Association|Century Club]] in 1867.<ref name=r40/>  Conkling, [[United States Senate election in New York, 1867|elected in 1867]] to the United States Senate, noticed Arthur and aided his rise in the party.<ref name=r44>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref>  Arthur became chairman of the New York City Republican executive committee in 1868.<ref name=r42>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 42; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 39</ref>  His ascent in the party hierarchy kept him busy most nights, and his wife began to resent his continual absence from the family home on party business.<ref name=r71>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref>

Conkling's machine was solidly behind General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s candidacy for president, and Arthur worked to raise funds for Grant's election in 1868.<ref name=r48>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 48</ref>  The opposing Democratic machine in New York City, known as [[Tammany Hall]], worked for Grant's opponent, former New York Governor Horatio Seymour; while Grant was victorious in the national vote, Seymour carried the state of New York easily.<ref name=r48/>  Arthur began to devote more of his time to politics and less to law.<ref name=r49>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 49<U+2013>50; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 42</ref>  In 1869, he was appointed counsel to the New York City tax commission under an arrangement his friend Murphy made with [[William Marcy Tweed]], the Tammany Hall boss.<ref name=r49/>  He remained at the job until 1870 at a salary of $10,000 a year.<ref name=r49/>{{#tag:ref|$10,000 in 1870 is equal to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000|1870}}}} in present terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}|group=note}}  Arthur's actual role in the tax commission's duties is still unknown; after Tweed's fall from power in 1871, Arthur never spoke of the Conking machine's cooperation with Tammany Hall.<ref name=r49/>  Shortly thereafter, President Grant gave control over the [[New York Custom House]] [[patronage]] to Conkling and appointed Murphy to the position of [[Collector of the Port of New York]].<ref name=r51>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 51<U+2013>53; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref>  Murphy's reputation as a war profiteer and his association with Tammany Hall made him unacceptable to many of his own party, but Conkling nevertheless convinced the Senate to confirm him.<ref name=r51/>  The Collector was responsible for hiring hundreds of workers to collect the tariffs due at the United States' busiest port.  Typically, these jobs were dispensed to adherents of the political machine responsible for hiring the Collector. Employees were required to make political contributions (known as "assessments") back to the machine, which made the job a highly coveted political plum.<ref name=r61>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 61<U+2013>67; [[#schwartz|Schwartz]], p. 182</ref>  Murphy's unpopularity only increased as he replaced workers loyal to Senator [[Reuben Fenton]]'s faction of the Republican party with those loyal to Conkling's.<ref name=r57>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref>  Eventually, the pressure to replace Murphy grew too great, and Grant asked for his resignation in 1871.<ref name=r57/>  To replace him, Grant nominated Arthur.<ref name=r60>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 60; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref>

The Senate confirmed Arthur's appointment.  As Collector, he not only controlled nearly a thousand jobs, but he also stood to receive personal compensation as great as any federal officeholder.<ref name=r61/>  Arthur's salary was $6,500, but senior customs employees were also compensated by the "moiety" system, which awarded them a percentage of the fines levied on importers who attempted to evade the tariff.<ref name=r59>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 59, 63, 85<U+2013>86</ref>  In total, his income came to more than $50,000<U+2014>more than the president's salary, and more than enough for him to enjoy fashionable clothes and a lavish lifestyle.<ref name=r59/>{{#tag:ref|$50,000 in 1871 is equal to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1871}}}} in present terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}|group=note}}  Among those who dealt with the Custom House, Arthur was one of the era's more popular collectors.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 68</ref>  He got along with his subordinates and, since Murphy had already filled the staff with Conkling's adherents, he had few occasions to fire anyone.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref>  He was also popular within the Republican party as he efficiently collected campaign assessments from the staff and placed party leaders' friends in jobs as positions became available.<ref name=r71/>  Arthur had a better reputation than Murphy, but reformers still criticized the patronage structure and the moiety system as corrupt.<ref name=r61/>  A rising tide of reform within the party caused Arthur to recharacterize the financial extractions from employees as "voluntary contributions" in 1872, but the principle remained the same and the party reaped the benefit of controlling government jobs.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref>  In that year, reform-minded Republicans formed the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] party and voted against Grant, but he was [[United States presidential election, 1872|re-elected]] in spite of their opposition.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 78<U+2013>79</ref>  Nevertheless, the movement for civil service reform continued to chip away at Conkling's patronage machine when, after Custom House employees were found to have improperly assessed fines against an importing company in 1874, Congress repealed the moiety system and put the staff, including Arthur, on regular salary.<ref name=r79>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 79<U+2013>84; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 49</ref>  As a result, his income dropped to $12,000 a year.<ref name=r79/>

===Clash with Hayes===
[[File:Arthur NYcustoms house cartoon.jpg|thumb|alt=Cartoon of a man kicking another man into the street|A cartoon depicting President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] kicking Arthur out of the New York Custom House.]]
Arthur's four-year term expired on December&nbsp;10, 1875, and Conkling, now among the most powerful politicians in Washington, arranged his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>'s reappointment by President Grant.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 87<U+2013>89</ref>  By 1876, Conkling was considering a run for the Presidency himself, but the selection of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], a reformer, at the [[1876 Republican National Convention]] presaged problems for the machine boss.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 95<U+2013>96; [[#kara|Karabell]], pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref>  Arthur and the machine gathered campaign funds with their usual zeal, but Conkling limited his own campaign activities to a few speeches.<ref name=r100>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 100<U+2013>105</ref>  Hayes's opponent, New York Governor [[Samuel J. Tilden]], carried New York but, after months of [[Electoral Commission (United States)|disputes over certain electoral votes]], lost the Presidency.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref>

Hayes entered office having pledged to reform the patronage system; in 1877, he and Treasury Secretary [[John Sherman (Ohio)|John Sherman]] made Conkling's machine their first target.<ref name=r100/>  Sherman ordered a commission led by John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House.<ref>[[#hoog|Hoogenboom]], pp. 318<U+2013>319</ref> Jay, with whom Arthur had collaborated in the ''Lemmon'' case two decades earlier, suggested that the Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointments that 20% of the employees were expendable.<ref>[[#hoog|Hoogenboom]], pp. 322<U+2013>325; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 118<U+2013>119; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref>  Sherman was less enthusiastic about the reforms than Hayes and Jay, but he approved the commission's report and ordered Arthur to make the personnel reductions.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 119<U+2013>120</ref>  Arthur appointed a committee of Custom House workers to determine where the cuts were to be made and, after a written protest, carried them out.<ref name=reeves121>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 121<U+2013>122</ref>  Notwithstanding his cooperation, the Jay Commission issued a second report critical of Arthur and other Custom House employees, and subsequent reports urging a complete reorganization.<ref name=reeves121/>

Hayes further struck at the heart of the [[spoils system]] by issuing an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] that forbade assessments and barred federal office holders from "tak[ing] part in the management of political organizations, caucuses, conventions, or election campaigns".<ref>[[#hoog|Hoogenboom]], pp. 322<U+2013>325; [[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 121</ref> Arthur and his subordinates, [[Alonzo B. Cornell]] and [[George H.

Arthur's job was thus saved, but only until July 1878 when Hayes took advantage of a Congressional recess to fire him and Cornell, and replace them by [[recess appointment]]s of Merritt and [[Silas W.

Conkling and his fellow Stalwarts wished to follow up their 1879 success at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]] by securing the nomination for their ally, ex-President Grant.<ref name=r160>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 160<U+2013>165</ref>  Their opponents in the Republican party, known as [[Half-Breed (politics)|Half-Breeds]], concentrated their efforts on [[James G. Blaine]], a Senator from Maine who was more amenable to civil service reform.<ref name=r160/>  Neither candidate commanded a majority of delegates and, deadlocked after thirty-six ballots, the convention turned to a [[dark horse]], [[James A.

The Democratic nominee, General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]], was popular and, since he had not taken unpopular positions (or any positions at all) on the issues of the day, he had not offended any important constituencies.<ref>[[#jordan|Jordan]], pp. 292<U+2013>305</ref>  As Republicans had done since the end of the Civil War, Garfield and Arthur initially focused their campaign on the "[[bloody shirt]]"<U+2014>the idea that returning Democrats to office would undo the victory of the Civil War and reward [[Secession in the United States|secessionists]].<ref name=r194>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 194<U+2013>196; [[#jordan|Jordan]], pp. 294<U+2013>295</ref>  With the war fifteen years in the past and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the tactic was less effective than the Republicans hoped.<ref name=r194/>  Realizing this, they shifted their approach to claim that Democrats would lower the country's [[tariff|protective tariff]], which would allow more cheap manufactured goods to be imported from Europe, thereby putting thousands of workingmen out of work.<ref name=r196>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 196<U+2013>197; [[#jordan|Jordan]], pp. 297<U+2013>302</ref>  This argument struck home in the swing states of New York and [[Indiana]], where many were employed in manufacturing.<ref name=r196/>  Hancock did not help his own cause when, in an attempt to remain neutral on the tariff, he said that "[t]he tariff question is a local question", which only served to make him appear uninformed about an important issue.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 196; [[#jordan|Jordan]], p. 301</ref>  Candidates for high office did not personally campaign in those days, but Arthur played a part in the campaign in his usual fashion: raising money.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 198<U+2013>202</ref>  The funds were crucial in the close election, and his home state of New York was pivotal.<ref name=r203>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 203<U+2013>204</ref>  The Republicans carried New York by 20,000 votes and, in an election with the largest turnout of qualified voters ever recorded<U+2014>78.4%<U+2014>they won the nationwide popular vote by just 7,018 votes.<ref name=r203/>  The [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] result was more decisive<U+2014>214 to 155<U+2014>and Garfield and Arthur were elected.<ref name=r203/>

After the election, Arthur worked to persuade Garfield to fill certain positions<U+2014>especially that of the Secretary of the Treasury<U+2014>with his fellow New York Stalwarts.<ref name=r205>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 205<U+2013>207</ref>  He was unsuccessful, and the Stalwart machine received a further rebuke when they discovered that Garfield planned to appoint Blaine, Conkling's arch-enemy, as Secretary of State.<ref name=r205/>  The running mates, never close, grew farther apart as Garfield continued to freeze out the Stalwarts from the patronage at his disposal.  Arthur's status in the administration fell further when, a month before inauguration day, he gave a speech in front of newspaper reporters that suggested the election in Indiana, a [[swing state]], had been won by illegal voting.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 213<U+2013>216; [[#kara|Karabell]], pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>  Garfield ultimately appointed a Stalwart, [[Thomas Lemuel James]], to be Postmaster General, but the cabinet fight and Arthur's ill-considered speech left the President and Vice President estranged when they took their oaths of office on March&nbsp;4, 1881.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 216<U+2013>219; [[#kara|Karabell]], pp. 54<U+2013>56</ref>  The Senate in the [[47th United States Congress]] was divided among 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, one independent ([[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]]) who announced he would [[Congressional caucus|caucus]] with the Democrats, one [[Readjuster Party|Readjuster]] ([[William Mahone]]) whose allegiance was uncertain, and four vacancies.<ref name=r220>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 220<U+2013>223</ref>  Immediately, the Democrats attempted to organize the Senate, knowing that the vacancies would soon be filled by Republicans.<ref name=r220/>  As Vice President, Arthur cast [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States|tie-breaking votes]] in favor of the Republicans when Mahone opted to join their caucus.<ref name=r220/>  Even so, the Senate remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield's nominations because of Conkling's opposition to some of them.<ref name=r223>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 223<U+2013>230</ref>  Just before going into recess in May 1881, the situation became more complicated when Conkling and the other Senator from New York, [[Thomas C. Platt]], resigned in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction.<ref name=r230>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 230<U+2013>233</ref>

With the Senate in recess, Arthur had no duties in Washington and returned to New York City.<ref name=r233>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 233<U+2013>237; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 147<U+2013>149</ref>  Once there, he traveled with Conkling to [[Albany, New York|Albany]], where the former Senator had hoped for a quick re-election to the Senate and, thereby, a rebuke to the Garfield administration.<ref name=r233/>{{#tag:ref|Before the passage of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Senators were elected by state legislatures.|group=note}}  The Republican majority in the state legislature was divided on the question, to Conkling and Platt's surprise, and they found themselves fighting for their political lives.<ref name=r233/>{{#tag:ref|Conkling and Pratt were ultimately denied re-election, being succeeded by [[Elbridge G.

===Taking office===
Arriving in Washington on September&nbsp;22, Arthur repeated the oath of office, this time administered by Chief Justice [[Morrison R. Waite]], because of concerns that a state judge may have lacked the authority to administer the presidential oath.<ref>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 53<U+2013>54; [[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 248</ref>  He first resided at the home of Senator [[John P. Jones]] in anticipation of significant remodeling he had ordered for the White House, including the addition of an elaborate fifty-foot glass screen made by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].<ref name=r252>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 252<U+2013>253, 268<U+2013>269</ref>  Since Arthur was a widower, his sister, [[Mary Arthur McElroy]], served as White House hostess.<ref name=r252/>  Arthur rapidly became Washington's most eligible bachelor and his social life became the subject of many rumors, but he remained devoted only to the memory of his late wife.<ref name=r275>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 275<U+2013>276</ref>  His son, Chester Jr., was then a freshman at [[Princeton University]] and his daughter, Nell, stayed in New York with a [[governess]] until 1882; when she arrived, Arthur attempted to shield her from the intrusions of the press as much as he could.<ref name=r275/>

Arthur quickly came into conflict with Garfield's cabinet, most of whose members represented Republican factions that opposed him.  He asked the cabinet members to remain until December, when Congress would reconvene, but Treasury Secretary [[William Windom]] submitted his resignation in October to enter a Senate race in his home state of [[Minnesota]].<ref name=windom>[[#howe|Howe]], p. 160; [[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 254</ref>  Arthur replaced him with [[Charles J. Folger]], his friend and fellow New York Stalwart.<ref name=windom/>  Attorney General [[Wayne MacVeagh]] was next to resign, believing that, as a reformer, he had no place in an Arthur cabinet.<ref name=macveigh>[[#howe|Howe]], p. 161; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref>  Despite Arthur's personal appeal to remain, MacVeigh resigned in December 1881 and Arthur replaced him with [[Benjamin H. Brewster]], a [[Philadelphia]] lawyer and machine politician who was thought to have some reformist leanings.<ref name=macveigh/>  Blaine, arch-nemesis of the Stalwart faction, agreed to remain Secretary of State until Congress reconvened, and when it did so he departed immediately.<ref name=blaine>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 160<U+2013>161; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 255<U+2013>257</ref>  Conkling expected Arthur to appoint him in Blaine's place, but the President instead chose [[Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen|Frederick T. Frelinghuysen]] of New Jersey, a Stalwart recommended by ex-President Grant.<ref name=blaine/>  Frelinghuysen advised Arthur not to fill any future vacancies with Stalwarts, but when Postmaster General James resigned in January 1882, Arthur selected [[Timothy O. Howe]], a [[Wisconsin]] Stalwart, to replace him.<ref name=r257>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 162<U+2013>163; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 257<U+2013>258</ref>  Navy Secretary [[William H. Hunt]] was next to resign, in April 1882, and Arthur attempted a more balanced approach by appointing [[William E. Chandler]] to the post, on Blaine's recommendation.<ref name=r257/>  Finally, when Interior Secretary [[Samuel J. Kirkwood]] resigned that same month, Arthur appointed [[Henry M. Teller]], a [[Colorado]] Stalwart to the office.<ref name=r257/>  Of the Cabinet members Arthur had inherited from Garfield, only Secretary of War [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] remained for the entirety of Arthur's term.<ref name=r257/>

===Civil service reform===
[[File:Chester A. Arthur by Ole Peter Hansen Balling.JPG|alt=Portrait of a man with a tremendous mustache|thumb|[[Ole Peter Hansen Balling]]'s 1881 portrait of Chester A. Arthur]]
In the 1870s, the public became aware of a [[star route scandal|scandal]] in which contractors for [[Star routes|star postal routes]] were greatly overpaid for their services with the connivance of government officials (including Second Assistant Postal Secretary [[Thomas J. Brady]] and former Senator [[Stephen Wallace Dorsey]]).<ref name=star>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 93<U+2013>95; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 297<U+2013>298</ref>  This was an example of the kind of corruption that reformers feared Arthur would permit, and reformers grew concerned that the former supporter of the spoils system would not devote his administration's energy to continuing the investigation into the scandal.<ref name=star/>  Nevertheless, the new Attorney General, Brewster, continued the investigations begun by MacVeigh and hired notable Democratic lawyers William W. Ker and [[Richard T. Merrick]] in an attempt both to improve the prosecution team and avoid the appearance of political partisanship.<ref name=star2>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 299<U+2013>300; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 182</ref>  Although Arthur had worked closely with Dorsey before taking office, once in office he supported the investigation and forced the resignation of officials suspected in the scandal.<ref name=star2/>  An 1882 trial of the ringleaders resulted in convictions for two minor conspirators and a [[hung jury]] for the rest.<ref name=star3>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 301<U+2013>302; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 185<U+2013>189</ref>  After a juror came forward with allegations that the defendants attempted to bribe him, the judge set aside the guilty verdicts and granted a new trial.<ref name=star3/>  Before the second trial began, Arthur removed five federal office holders who were sympathetic with the defense, including a former Senator.<ref name=star4>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 303<U+2013>305; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 189<U+2013>193</ref>  The second trial began in December 1882 and lasted until July 1883 and, again, did not result in a guilty verdict.<ref name=star4/>  Failure to obtain a conviction tarnished the administration's image, but Arthur did succeed in putting a stop to the fraud.<ref name=star4/>

Garfield's assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the growing public demand for civil service reform.<ref name=r320>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 320<U+2013>324; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 96<U+2013>97; [[#theriault|Theriault]], pp. 52<U+2013>53, 56</ref>  Democratic and Republican leaders both realized that they could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system and, by 1882, the tide turned in favor of reform.<ref name=r320/>  As early as 1880, Democratic Senator [[George H. Pendleton]] of Ohio had introduced legislation that would allow for selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an [[Civil service examination|examination]].<ref name=r320/>  In his first [[State of the Union address|annual Presidential address to Congress]] in 1881, Arthur requested civil service reform legislation and Pendleton again introduced his bill, but Congress did not pass it.<ref name=r320/>  Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue.<ref>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 99<U+2013>100; [[#theriault|Theriault]], pp. 57<U+2013>63</ref>  As a result, the [[lame duck session]] of Congress was more amenable to civil service reform; the Senate approved Pendleton's bill 38<U+2013>5 and the House soon concurred by a vote of 155<U+2013>47.<ref name=r324>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 324; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 101<U+2013>102</ref>  Arthur signed the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] into law on January&nbsp;16, 1883.<ref name=r324/>  In just two years' time, an unrepentant Stalwart had become the president who ushered in long-awaited civil service reform.<ref name=r324/>

At first, the act applied only to 10% of federal jobs and, without proper implementation by the president, it could have gone no further.<ref name=r325>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 325<U+2013>327; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 102<U+2013>104</ref>  Even after he signed the act into law, its proponents doubted Arthur's commitment to reform.<ref name=r325/>  To their surprise, he acted quickly to appoint the members of the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]] that the law created, naming reformers [[Dorman Bridgeman Eaton]], [[John Milton Gregory]], and [[Leroy D. Thoman]] as commissioners.<ref name=r325/>  The chief examiner, [[Silas W. Burt]], was a long-time reformer who had been Arthur's opponent when the two men worked at the New York Customs House.<ref name=h209>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 209<U+2013>210</ref>  The commission issued its first rules in May 1883; by 1884, half of all postal officials and three-quarters of the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]] jobs were to be awarded by merit.<ref name=h209/>  That year, Arthur expressed satisfaction in the new system, praising its effectiveness "in securing competent and faithful public servants and in protecting the appointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur%27s_Fourth_State_of_the_Union_Address |title=Fourth State of the Union Address |author=Chester A.

===Surplus and the tariff===
Since 1866, the federal government had collected more revenue than it expended, with the surplus reaching $145 million in 1882.<ref name=r328>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 328<U+2013>329; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], p. 168</ref>  Opinions varied on how to [[Balanced budget|balance the budget]].  Most Democrats wished to lower tariffs, in order to reduce revenues and lower the cost of imported goods.  Republicans largely disagreed, believing that high tariffs ensured high wages for men employed in manufacturing and [[natural resource extraction]].  They preferred that the government spend more on [[public works]] and reduce [[excise]] taxes.<ref name=r328/>  Arthur mostly agreed with his party, and in 1882 called for the abolition of excise taxes on everything except liquor, as well as a simplification of the complex tariff structure.<ref name=r330>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 330<U+2013>333; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 169<U+2013>171</ref>  In May of that year, Representative [[William D. Kelley]] of Pennsylvania introduced a bill to establish a tariff commission.<ref name=r330/>  The bill passed and Arthur signed it into law but appointed mostly [[Protectionism|protectionists]] to the committee.  Republicans were pleased with the committee's make-up but were surprised when, in December 1882, they submitted a report to Congress calling for tariff cuts averaging between 20 and 25%.  The commission's recommendations were ignored, however, as the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]], dominated by protectionists, wrote the law to yield reductions of 10%.<ref name=r330/>  After conference with the Senate, the bill that emerged only reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47%.  The bill passed both houses narrowly on March&nbsp;3, 1883, the last full day of the [[47th United States Congress|47th Congress]].  Arthur signed the measure into law, but it did little to reduce the surplus.<ref name=r334>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 334<U+2013>335</ref>

At the same time as the tariff debate, Congress attempted to balance the budget from the other side of the ledger by passing a [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1882|Rivers and Harbors Bill]] that contained the then-unprecedented expenditure of $19 million for internal improvements.<ref name=r280>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 280<U+2013>282; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], p. 81</ref>  While Arthur was not opposed to internal improvements, the scale of the bill disturbed him, as did its focus on "particular localities," rather than on projects that benefited a large part of the nation.<ref name=r280/>  On August&nbsp;1, 1882, Arthur vetoed the bill to widespread popular acclaim.<ref name=r280/>  In his veto message, he wrote that his principal objection to the bill was that it appropriated funds for purposes "not for the common defense or general welfare, and which do not promote commerce among the States."<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 281</ref>  Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] his veto,<ref name=r280/> and the new law reduced the surplus by $19 million.  Many Republicans considered the law a success at the time, but later believed the unpopular law contributed to their loss of seats in the elections of 1882.<ref>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 196<U+2013>197; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 281<U+2013>282; [[#kara|Karabell]], p. 90</ref>

Blaine]] took the United States' diplomacy in [[Latin America]] in a new direction, urging reciprocal trade agreements and offering to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations.<ref name=d55>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 55<U+2013>57; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 284<U+2013>289</ref>  Blaine proposed holding a Pan-American conference in 1882 to discuss trade and an end to the [[War of the Pacific]] being fought by [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]].<ref name=d55/>  This represented a greater involvement in affairs south of the [[Rio Grande]] than the United States had previously attempted, and marked a significant shift in foreign policy.<ref name=d55/>  Blaine did not remain in office long enough to see the effort through, and when [[Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen|Frederick T. Frelinghuysen]] replaced him at the end of 1881, the conference efforts lapsed.<ref name=d129>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 129<U+2013>132; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 289<U+2013>293; [[#bastert|Bastert]], pp. 653<U+2013>671</ref>  Frelinghuysen also discontinued Blaine's peace efforts in the War of the Pacific, fearing that the United States might be drawn into the conflict.<ref name=d129/>  Arthur and Frelinghuysen continued Blaine's efforts to encourage trade among the nations of the Western Hemisphere, and a treaty with [[Mexico]] providing for reciprocal tariff reductions was signed in 1882 and approved by the Senate in 1884.<ref name=d173>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 173<U+2013>175; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 398<U+2013>399, 409</ref>  The House declined to approve the legislation required to bring the treaty into force, however, rendering it a [[wikt:dead letter|dead letter]].<ref name=d173/>  Similar efforts at reciprocal trade treaties with [[Santo Domingo]] and [[Spanish West Indies|Spain's American colonies]] were defeated by February 1885, and an existing reciprocity treaty with the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was allowed to lapse.<ref name=d175>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 175<U+2013>178; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 398<U+2013>399, 407<U+2013>410</ref>

The 47th Congress spent a great deal of its time on the regulation of immigration, at times in accord with Arthur's wishes and at times against them.<ref name=h168>[[#howe|Howe]], pp. 168<U+2013>169; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], p. 81</ref>  In July 1882, without significant opposition, Congress passed a bill regulating steamships that carried immigrants to the United States.<ref name=h168/>  To their surprise, Arthur vetoed it, citing problems in the bill's wording; Congress agreed to reword it, and he signed the revised measure.<ref name=h168/>  He also signed in August of that year the [[Immigration Act of 1882]], which levied a fifty-cent tax on immigrants to the United States, as well as excluding from entry the [[mentally ill]], the [[mentally retarded]], [[criminals]], or any person "unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge."<ref>[[#hutchinson|Hutchinson]], p. 162; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 169</ref>  A larger debate concerned the status of one particular group of immigrants: the Chinese.  In 1868, the Senate had ratified the [[Burlingame Treaty]] with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of [[Chinese American history|Chinese immigrants]] into the country.  As the economy soured after the [[Panic of 1873]], Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages.<ref name=r277>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 277<U+2013>278; [[#hoog|Hoogenboom]], pp. 387<U+2013>389</ref>  In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty, which President Hayes vetoed.<ref name=r277/>  Three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants.  Senator [[John Franklin Miller (senator)|John F. Miller]] of [[California]] introduced a [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that would have denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and completely ban their immigration for the next twenty years.<ref name=r278/>  The bill passed the Senate and House by overwhelming margins, arriving at Arthur's desk in April 1882.<ref name=r278>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 278<U+2013>279; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 81<U+2013>84</ref>  Arthur vetoed the bill, seeing the twenty-year ban as a breach of the renegotiated treaty of 1880, which allowed only a "reasonable" suspension of immigration. Eastern newspapers praised the veto, but he was widely condemned in the Western states.  Congress was unable to override the veto, instead passing a new bill that reduced the ban on Chinese immigration to ten years.  Although he still objected to the denial of citizenship to Chinese immigrants, Arthur signed the compromise measure into law on May&nbsp;6, 1882.<ref name=r278/>{{#tag:ref|The portion of the law denying citizenship to Chinese-Americans would be found unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' in 1898.|group=note}}

===Naval reform===
[[File:Squadron of Evolution (Hart).jpg|left|thumb|alt=Photograph of four warships|The "Squadron of Evolution" at anchor in 1889, after ''Yorktown'' had been added: ''Chicago'', ''Yorktown'', ''Boston'', ''Atlanta'']]
In the years following the Civil War, [[United States Navy|American naval power]] declined precipitously, shrinking from nearly 700 vessels to just 52, most of which were obsolete.<ref>[[#reeves|Reeves]], p. 337; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], p. 145</ref>  The nation's military focus over the fifteen years before Garfield and Arthur's election had been on the [[American Indian wars|Indian wars]] in the West, rather than the high seas, but as the region was increasingly pacified, many in Congress grew concerned at the poor state of the Navy.<ref name=r338>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 338<U+2013>341; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 145<U+2013>147</ref>  Garfield's Secretary of the Navy, [[William H. Hunt]], advocated reform of the Navy and his successor, [[William E. Chandler]], appointed an advisory board to prepare a report on modernization.<ref>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 147<U+2013>149</ref>  Based on the suggestions in the report, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of three steel [[protected cruiser]]s (''[[USS Atlanta (1884)|Atlanta]]'', ''[[USS Boston (1884)|Boston]]'', and ''[[USS Chicago (1885)|Chicago]]'') and an armed dispatch-steamer (''[[USS Dolphin (PG-24)|Dolphin]]''), collectively known as the "ABCD Ships" or the "[[Squadron of Evolution]]".<ref name=navy>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 342<U+2013>343; [[#abbot|Abbot]], pp. 346<U+2013>347</ref>   Congress also approved funds to rebuild four [[monitor (warship)|monitors]] (''[[USS Puritan (BM-1)|Puritan]]'', ''[[USS Amphitrite (BM-2)|Amphitrite]]'', ''[[USS Monadnock (BM-3)|Monadnock]]'', and ''[[USS Terror (BM-4)|Terror]],'') which had lain uncompleted since 1877.<ref name=navy/>  The contracts to build the ABCD ships were all awarded to the low bidder, [[John Roach & Sons]] of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], Pennsylvania,<ref name=r343>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 343<U+2013>345; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 149<U+2013>151</ref> even though Roach once employed Secretary Chandler as a lobbyist.<ref name=r343/> Democrats turned against the "New Navy" projects and, when they won control of the [[48th United States Congress|48th Congress]], refused to appropriate funds for seven more steel warships.<ref name=r343/>  Even without the additional ships, the state of the Navy improved when, after several construction delays, the last of the new ships entered service in 1889.<ref name=r349>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 349<U+2013>350; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 152<U+2013>153</ref>

===Civil rights===
Like his Republican predecessors, Arthur struggled with the question of how his party was to challenge the Democrats in [[Southern United States|the South]] and how, if at all, to protect the civil rights of black southerners.<ref name=r306>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 306<U+2013>308; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 105<U+2013>108</ref>  Since the end of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats (or "[[Bourbon Democrat]]s") had regained power in the South, and the Republican party dwindled rapidly as their primary supporters in the region, blacks, [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|were disenfranchised]].<ref name=r306/>  One crack in the [[Solid South|solidly Democratic South]] emerged with the growth of a new party, the [[Readjuster Party|Readjusters]], in Virginia.<ref name=r307>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 307<U+2013>309; [[#ayers|Ayers]], pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref>  Having won an election in that state on a platform of more education funding (for black and white schools alike) and abolition of the [[poll tax]] and the [[pillory|whipping post]], many northern Republicans saw the Readjusters as a more viable ally in the South than the moribund southern Republican party.<ref name=r307/>  Arthur agreed, and directed the federal patronage in Virginia through the Readjusters rather than the Republicans.<ref name=r307/>  He followed the same pattern in other Southern states, forging coalitions with independents and [[Greenback Party]] members.<ref name=r307/>  Some black Republicans felt betrayed by the pragmatic gambit, but others (including [[Frederick Douglass]] and ex-Senator [[Blanche K. Bruce]]) endorsed the administration's actions, as the Southern independents had more liberal racial policies than the Democrats.<ref name=r310>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 310<U+2013>313</ref>  Arthur's coalition policy was only successful in Virginia, however, and by 1885 the Readjuster movement began to collapse with the election of a Democratic president.<ref>[[#ayers|Ayers]], pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref>  Other federal action on behalf of blacks was equally ineffective: when the Supreme Court struck down the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] in [[United States v. Harris|an 1883 decision]], Arthur expressed his disagreement with the decision in a message to Congress, but was unable to persuade Congress to pass any new legislation in its place.<ref>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 112<U+2013>114</ref>  Arthur did, however, effectively intervene to overturn a [[court-martial]] ruling against a black [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] cadet, [[Johnson Chesnut Whittaker|Johnson Whittaker]], after the [[Judge Advocate General of the United States Army|Judge Advocate General of the Army]], [[David G. Swaim]], found the prosecution's case against Whittaker legally invalid and based on racial animus.<ref>[[#marszalek|Marszalek]], ''[[passim]].''</ref>

The administration faced a different challenge in the West, where [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|the Mormon Church]] was under government pressure to stop the practice of [[polygamy]] in [[Utah Territory]].<ref name=d84>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref>  Garfield had believed polygamy was criminal behavior and was morally detrimental to family values, and Arthur's views were, for once, in line with his predecessor's.<ref name=d84/>  In 1882, he signed the [[Edmunds Act]] into law, making polygamy a federal crime and barring polygamists from public office.<ref name=d84/>  The Arthur administration also dealt with changing relations with western [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes.<ref name=d85>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 85<U+2013>89</ref>  The Indian Wars were winding down, and public sentiment was shifting toward more favorable treatment of Native Americans.  Arthur urged Congress to increase funding for Indian education, which it did in 1884, although not to the extent he wished.<ref name=d89>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 89<U+2013>92; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 362<U+2013>363</ref>  He also favored a move to the [[Allotment Era|allotment system]], under which individual Native Americans, rather than tribes, would own land.  Arthur was unable to convince Congress to adopt the idea during his administration but, in 1887, the [[Dawes Act]] changed the law to favor such a system.<ref name=d89/>  The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to Native Americans as most of their land was resold at low prices to white [[Speculation|speculators]].<ref>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], p. 91; [[#stuart|Stuart]], pp. 452<U+2013>454</ref>

===Health, travel, and renomination===
[[File:President Chester A. Arthur Yellowstone National Park Expedition 1883.jpg|alt=A group of men seated in a forest|thumb|right|Arthur on an expedition in [[Yellowstone National Park]] along with [[Philip Sheridan]] and [[Robert Todd Lincoln]].]]
Shortly after becoming President, Arthur was diagnosed with [[Bright's disease]], a [[kidney]] ailment now referred to as [[nephritis]].<ref name=r317>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 317<U+2013>318; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 243<U+2013>244</ref>  He attempted to keep his condition private, but by 1883 rumors of his illness began to circulate.<ref name=r317/>  By that time he had become thinner and more aged in appearance, as well as less energetic in keeping up with the demands of the presidency.<ref name=r317/>  Hoping to rejuvenate his health by getting out of Washington, Arthur and some political friends traveled to [[Florida]] in April 1883.<ref name=r355>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 355<U+2013>359; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 244<U+2013>246</ref>  The vacation had the opposite effect, and Arthur suffered from intense pain before returning to Washington.<ref name=r355/>  The following year, on the advice of [[Missouri]] Senator [[George Graham Vest]], he visited [[Yellowstone National Park]].<ref name=r364>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 364<U+2013>367; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 247<U+2013>248</ref>  Reporters accompanied the presidential party, helping to publicize the new [[History of the National Park Service|National Park system]].<ref name=r364/>  The Yellowstone trip was more beneficial to Arthur's health than his Florida excursion, and he returned to Washington refreshed after two months of travel.<ref>[[#kara|Karabell]], pp. 124<U+2013>125; [[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 366<U+2013>367</ref>

As the [[United States presidential election, 1884|1884 presidential election]] approached, [[James G. Blaine]] was thought to be the favorite for the Republican nomination, but Arthur, too, contemplated a run for a full term as President.<ref name=r368>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 368<U+2013>371; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 254<U+2013>257</ref>  In the months leading up to the [[1884 Republican National Convention]], however, Arthur began to realize that neither faction of the Republican party was prepared to give him their full support: the Half-Breeds were again solidly behind Blaine, while Stalwarts were undecided; some backed Arthur, with others considering Senator [[John A. Logan]] of Illinois.<ref name=r368/>  Reform-minded Republicans, friendlier to Arthur after he endorsed civil service reform, were still not certain enough of his reform credentials to back him over Senator [[George F. Edmunds]] of Vermont, who had long favored their cause.<ref name=r368/>  Business leaders supported him, as did Southern Republicans who owed their jobs to his control of the patronage, but by the time they began to rally around him, Arthur had decided against a serious campaign for the nomination.<ref name=r373>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 373<U+2013>375; [[#doenecke|Doenecke]], pp. 181<U+2013>182</ref>  He kept up a token effort, believing that to drop out would cast doubt on his actions in office and raise questions about his health, but by the time the convention began in June, his defeat was almost assured.<ref name=r373/>  Blaine led on the first ballot, and by the fourth ballot he had a majority.<ref name=r380>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 380<U+2013>381; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 264<U+2013>265</ref>  Arthur [[telegraph]]ed his congratulations to Blaine and accepted his defeat with equanimity.<ref name=r380/>  He played no role in the 1884 campaign, which Blaine would later say contributed to his loss that November to the Democratic nominee, [[Grover Cleveland]].<ref name=r387>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 387<U+2013>389; [[#howe|Howe]], pp. 265<U+2013>266</ref>

===Judicial appointments===
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by Chester A. Arthur|l1=Chester A. Arthur judicial appointments}}
Arthur made appointments to fill two vacancies on the [[United States Supreme Court]].  The first vacancy arose in July 1881 with the death of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Nathan Clifford]], a Democrat who had been a member of the Court since before the Civil War.<ref name=r260>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 260<U+2013>261; [[#howe|Howe]], p. 195</ref>  Arthur nominated [[Horace Gray]], a distinguished jurist from the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] to replace him, and the nomination was easily confirmed.<ref name=r260/>  Gray would serve until 1902 and was the author of the court's [[majority opinion]] in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]],'' which overturned the section of the Chinese Exclusion Act that denied Chinese-Americans citizenship.  The second vacancy occurred when Associate Justice [[Ward Hunt]] retired in January 1882.  Arthur first nominated his old political boss, [[Roscoe Conkling]]; he doubted that Conkling would accept, but felt obligated to offer a high office to his former patron.<ref name=r260/>  The Senate confirmed the nomination but, as expected, Conkling declined it.<ref name=r260/>  Senator George Edmunds was Arthur's next choice, but he declined to be considered.<ref>[[#doenecke|Doenecke]], p. 76</ref>  Instead, Arthur nominated [[Samuel Blatchford]], a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] for the last fifteen years.<ref name=r260/>  Blatchford accepted, and his nomination was approved within two weeks.<ref name=r260/>  Blatchford served on the Court until his death in 1893.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=192&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na |title=Blatchford, Samuel M. |work=Biographical Directory of Federal Judges |publisher=Federal Judicial Center |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

==Retirement and death==
[[File:Chet Arthur Mad Sq jeh.JPG|alt=Bronze statue of a man in a city park|thumb|right|Chester A. Arthur statue at [[Madison Square]] in [[New York City]]]]
Arthur left office in 1885 and returned to his New York City home.  Two months before the end of his term, several New York Stalwarts approached him to request that he run for United States Senate, but he declined, preferring to return to his old law practice at Arthur, Knevals & Ransom.<ref name=r412>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 412<U+2013>414</ref>  His health limited his activity with the firm, and Arthur served only [[of counsel]].  He took on few assignments with the firm and was often too ill to leave his house.<ref name=r416>[[#reeves|Reeves]], pp. 416<U+2013>418</ref>  He managed a few public appearances, up until the end of 1885.<ref name=r416/>

After summering in [[New London, Connecticut]], in 1886, he returned quite ill and, on November&nbsp;16, ordered nearly all of his papers, both personal and official, burned.<ref name=r416/>{{#tag:ref|A small number of Arthur's papers survived and passed to his grandson, [[Gavin Arthur]], who allowed Arthur's biographer, Thomas C.
