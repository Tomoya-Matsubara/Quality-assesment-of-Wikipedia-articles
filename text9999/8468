==Plot==
{{Double image|left|Dianna Agron 2009.jpg|132|Cory Monteith 2009.jpg|151|The past relationship between Quinn (Agron, ''left'') and Finn (Monteith, ''right'') is revisited in this episode.}}
Glee club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) gives New Directions a love song assignment. Having fallen for the group's newest member [[Lauren Zizes]] (Ashley Fink), [[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]) serenades her with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]". Lauren finds his song choice insulting and stands him up on a pre-Valentine's date, but eventually agrees to spend Valentine's Day with him as friends.

[[Artie Abrams]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) and [[Mike Chang]] ([[Harry Shum, Jr.]]) celebrate their respective relationships by performing [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]" for their girlfriends, [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris (actress)|Heather Morris]]) and [[Tina Cohen-Chang]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]). Tina later begins to sing "[[My Funny Valentine]]" to Mike, but is too overcome with emotion, and begins to cry while continuing to sing.

[[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) sets up a kissing booth, hoping to kiss his ex-girlfriend [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]). She initially refuses, but kisses him at the insistence of her boyfriend [[Sam Evans]] ([[Chord Overstreet]]), who is suspicious of their relationship. The kiss further re-ignites Finn and Quinn's feelings for one another, and they begin an affair. [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]), angry for having recently had her bad behavior highlighted by the other club members, conspires to give them [[Infectious mononucleosis|mono]] and reveal Quinn's infidelity. Finn's most recent ex-girlfriend [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]) is dismayed by his renewed feelings for Quinn, but resolves to concentrate on her career instead of romance, and leads the female New Directions members in a performance of [[Katy Perry]]'s "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]".

At Dalton Academy, a private school attended by former New Directions member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), the object of his affection [[Blaine (Glee)|Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]) announces his intention to sing a love song to his crush. Kurt believes that Blaine has feelings for him, so is disappointed when his crush turns out to be Jeremiah (Alexander Nifong), the assistant manager at a local [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] store. The Dalton Academy Warblers accompany Blaine as he serenades Jeremiah with [[Robin Thicke]]'s "[[When I Get You Alone]]". Jeremiah is subsequently fired and rebuffs Blaine. Kurt confesses his feelings to Blaine, who tells Kurt that he cares for him but is terrible at romance, and does not want to risk damaging their friendship. The episode ends with New Directions assembled at Breadstix, a local restaurant, where the Warblers perform the titular "[[Silly Love Songs]]".

The musical covers and performances for the episode were mostly well-received by critics and fans alike.

I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves.

Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll."<ref name="ENT">http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/glee-season-2-episode-12/4/</ref> She went on to give the performance an A-.

Then downright uncomfortable."<ref name="ENT">http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/glee-season-2-episode-12/4/</ref> However, Gonzalez would praise the other parts of the performance, writing, "It was <U+00FC>bersweet when Tina started getting choked up during her song, because let's face it, it happens. You can love someone so much it hurts.

Erica Futterman of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' gave a very positive review of the episode, writing, "This was our favorite type of ''Glee'' episode.

Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, ''Glee'' has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters<U+2019> lives.

Matt Richenthal of ''TV Fanatic'' gave the episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, and went on to write a very positive review for the episode. He wrote, "A funny, touching, entertaining ''Glee'' episode that didn't feature a single line from [[Sue Sylvester]]?!? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on "Silly Love Songs", as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2011/02/glee-review-silly-love-songs/|title="Glee Review: Lots of Luck, Santana"|last=Richenthal|first=Matt|date=February 8, 2011|work=TV Fanatic|publisher=|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> Joel Keller of ''[[TV Squad]]'' gave the episode a positive review, writing, ""Silly Love Songs" strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-[[Super Bowl]] episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2011/02/08/glee-valentines-day-episode-recap/|title="'Glee' Valentine's Day Episode Recap"|last=Keller|first=Joel|date=February 8, 2011|work=[[TV Squad]]|publisher=[[Weblogs, Inc.]]|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' gave the episode a positive review, going on to praise the storyline and the musicals of the episode.<ref name="TVDW">http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2011/02/09/glee-watch-your-kiss-is-on-my-list/</ref> However, Soraya Roberts of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' gave the episode a negative episode, writing, "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer.
