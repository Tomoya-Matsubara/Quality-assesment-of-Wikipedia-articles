'''Dover Athletic Football Club''' are an [[football (soccer)|association football]] team that play in the town of [[Dover]], [[Kent]], [[England]]. They currently play in the [[Isthmian League Division One South]].

==History==
The first football club in [[Dover]] was formed in [[1891]], and was known as Dover FC. The club competed in the [[Kent League]] before disbanding in [[1910]]. 

Reformed as Dover United in [[1920]], the new club survived for another thirteen years before another winding-up operation saw its rebirth as Dover FC. The club was an amateur club until the end of the [[1946]]/[[1947|47]] season, when they were reformed as a semi-professional club. Dover played in the [[Kent League]] until [[1959]], when the club was admitted to the [[Southern League (football)|Southern League]]. Playing in the First Division, Dover won promotion in [[1967]], and played in the premiership until they were relegated eleven years later. Despite winning the First Division title the following season, Dover were not promoted. 

In [[1983]] the club was reformed as Dover Athletic, and under manager Chris Kinnear, the club achieved promotion to the Premier Division in [[1987]]/[[1988|88]]. They went on to win the Premier Division championship, but were denied promotion to the Conference when their ground was deemed not to be up to standard. Champions once more in [[1992]]/[[1993|93]] they met the ground requirements and were promoted to the [[Football Conference]]. 

A solid debut season (8th) was followed by several years of struggle avoiding relegation, with long serving boss Chris Kinnear, John Ryan, Peter Taylor and Joe O'Sullivan all failing to address the lowly progress. In [[1994]]/[[1995|95]], Dover finished in 20th position (out of 22), but were fortunate that only two football clubs suffered relegation that season. The [[1999]]/[[2000|00]] season saw the club achieve its highest position (6th) under Bill Williams. However, the following season saw Dover struggle against relegation, finishing 15th out of 22. Manager Bill Williams [http://www.doverathletic.com/SPNews/SPNews.php?id=149 left] Dover at the end of the season. The [[2001]]/[[2002|02]] season got off to a terrible start under new manager Gary Bellamy and he was sacked in November. His replacement [[Neville Southall]] was unable to save Dover from finishing bottom of the league and relegation into the [[Southern League (football)|Southern League]]. Financial problems were revealed and the club were forced to go into a CVA.

The club failed to earn a position in the newly formed [[Conference South]] league for the 2004-05 season, finishing 19th in the [[Southern League Premier Division]], and were then relegated to the Isthmian League Division One after finishing second from bottom in the Premier Division, with financial problems almost causing the club to close down before [http://www.doverathletic.com/PlayerProfiles/showinfo.php?id=106&c=s Jim Parmenter] led a [http://www.doverathletic.com/PlayerProfiles/index.php?team=s consortium] of businessmen to [http://www.doverathletic.com/SPNews/SPNews.php?id=240 save the club].

Dover Athletic narrowly missed out on a swift return to the Premier Division, after finishing fifth in Division One and losing in a play-off final 3-2 at Kent rivals Tonbridge.

In August 2006, it was [http://www.doverathletic.com/SPNews/SPNews.php?id=485 announced] that the club had successfully negotiated an end to their CVA repayments, which had stifled the club's progress for the previous four seasons.
