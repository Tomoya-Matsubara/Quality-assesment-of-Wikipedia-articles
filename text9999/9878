'''''Jazz Samba''''' is a [[bossa nova]] LP by [[Stan Getz]] and [[Charlie Byrd]], released on the [[Verve Records|Verve]] label on April 20, 1962.

''Jazz Samba'' was the first major bossa-nova album on the [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] scene. It was the real start of the bossa-nova excitement in America, which peaked in the mid-1960s. Though Stan Getz was the featured star of the album, it was very strongly inspired and designed by the [[guitar]]ist Charlie Byrd. They were joined by two [[bass guitar|bass]]ists ([[Keter Betts]] and Charlie's brother, Gene (Joe) Byrd), and two [[drum]]mers ([[Buddy Deppenschmidt]] and [[William Frank Reichenbach Sr.|Bill Reichenbach]]) for the recording at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on February 13, 1962, and it was released on April 20, that year as Verve LP V6-8432.

Although it is often described as music by Brazilian composer [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]], only two of the seven tracks on the album are Jobim compositions ("[[Desafinado]]" [Slightly Out of Tune] and "[[Samba de Uma Nota S<U+00F3>]]" [One Note Samba]), the rest being by other [[Brazil]]ian composers and by Charlie Byrd. Getz won the [[Grammy Awards of 1963|Grammy for Best Jazz Performance of 1963]] for the track "Desafinado", and went on to make many other bossa-nova recordings, most notably with [[Jo<U+00E3>o Gilberto]] and [[Astrud Gilberto]], and most famously "[[The Girl From Ipanema]]".
