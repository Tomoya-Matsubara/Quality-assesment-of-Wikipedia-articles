'''''Hygrocybe aurantipes'''''  is a [[Agaricales|gilled]] [[fungus]] of the [[Hygrophoraceae|waxcap]] family found in a few scattered locations in wet forests in [[eastern Australia]]. It is a distinctive small [[mushroom]] with a 2-4 cm diameter olive-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] and golden-yellow [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and gills, not easily confused with any other species. Known only from [[Lane Cove National Park]] in [[Sydney]]'s suburban [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]], [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] and [[Mount Wilson, New South Wales|Mount Wilson]] in the [[Blue Mountains]], it has been designated as ''vulnerable'' as defined by the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, by the [[New South Wales]] Government.

==Taxonomy==
''Hygrocybe aurantipes'' was originally collected by Ray and Elma Kearney in [[Lane Cove National Park]] in Sydney's suburban [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] district on [[June 17]] [[1990]], and officially described by Australian [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Anthony M. Young|Tony Young]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Young AM, Wood AE |year=1997|title=Studies on the Hygrophoraceae (Fungi, Homobasidiomycetes, Agaricales) of Australia |journal= Australian Systematic Botany |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=911-1030}}</ref> Its specific epithet 'golden-footed' is derived from the Latin root ''aurant-'' 'gold' and ''pes'' 'foot'.<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| date = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|pages = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref>

==Description==
''Hygrocybe aurantipes'' is a small mushroom with a dark olive [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] 2-4 centimetres (<U+00BE>-1<U+00BD> [[inch|in]]) in diameter, initially conical and later flattening to almost flat. The widely-spaced thick gills are adnate, and connected by veins on the undersurface of the cap, and are bright orange or yellow. The yellow or orange [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 3-6 cm (1<U+2153>-2<U+00BD> in) high and 0.35-0.7 cm thick and may taper and be paler at the base. The spore print is white, the oval to oblong spores measuring 5.5 x 8.5 <U+03BC>m.<ref name=Young88>Young, p. 88</ref> A disinctive mushroom, it is not readily confused with any other species.

==Distribution and habitat==
Saprotrophic, this species is little known with a restricted distribution from the [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] and [[Mount Wilson, New South Wales|Mount Wilson]] in the Blue Mountains and Sydney Basin (Lane Cove National Park). Fruiting bodies appear in autumn and winter (May to August), in leaf litter and mossy [[Riparian zone|riparian]] areas in rainforest in warm temperate or subtropical climates.<ref name=Young92>Young, p. 92</ref>

It is currently listed by the New South Wales Government as ''vulnerable'',<ref name=DECC/> that is "likely to become endangered unless the circumstances and factors threatening its survival or evolutionary development cease to operate" as defined by the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/legislation.aspx |title=NSW Threatened Species Legislation |accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=New South Wales Government - Department of Environment and Climate Change website}}</ref> Searching of suitable habitat has only yielded a limited occurrence, and its habitat has been deemed vulnerable to waterborne pollution, weed encroachment and damage from pedestrians.<ref name=DECC>{{cite web |author= NSW Scientific Committee |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/HygrocybeAurantipesVulSpListing.htm |title=''Hygrocybe aurantipes'' (an agaric fungus) - vulnerable species listing |accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=New South Wales Government - Department of Environment and Climate Change website}}</ref>
